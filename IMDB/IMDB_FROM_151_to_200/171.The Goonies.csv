0,MartinHafer,Written purely for kids of the 80s...all others beware.,4,25 August 2021,"""The Goonies"" is definitely a cult film and people who like it don't just like it...they think it's the best film ever! However, my bet is most of these folks were kids who saw it in the 1980s. I was in my 20s when it debuted....and I noticed it was marketed towards kids, even more so than most of Steven Spielberg's productions, so I avoided it. And, after seeing it tonight....many years later, I realized I was right...I just wasn't in the demographics the studio was seeking out with this film. With the stars being kids, the jokes being crude, the adventure plot, and the logic often being tenuous at best, it clearly is NOT a film marketed towards adults. And, I am sure this added to the appeal of the film to kids...that it was THEIR film and adults just didn't get it!The film stars a group of four kids and three teens. The kids in particular seem like caricatures...not real kids. You have the fat kid, the brainy computer nerd Asian kid, the smart aleck kid who can somehow read 17th century Spanish and the 'normal' kid who is the hero. They are tropes more than kids. As for the adults, most of them in the film are crooks or jerks....as this IS a kids' movie and kids LIKE films where adults are the enemy...at least that's how it was in the 1980s.The group stumble upon a treasure map in the normal kid's attic and the map takes them to the hideout for three awful criminals. The kids manage to sneak past them and explore the tunnels beneath the house for pirate treasure...assisted by the teens and a weird guy named 'Sloth'. Eventually, the crooks realize what's happening and it's a mad dash to the treasure.As I said before, the film is marketed towards kids....with plenty of content that might have worried parents back in the 80s. Murder, a surprising amount of bad language and a scary plot...just the sort of stuff kids love! However, as an adult, you watch this and notice all the illogical plot elements and cheap cliches....stuff kids generally don't notice.My rating is a 2 for adults and 8 for younger kids. Adults will find it very rough viewing....even painful at times. It will also upset many parents because so much adult material is in the film. Kids will LOVE the adult material and like that it casts kids (albeit incredibly unrealistic ones) as the heroes. Overall, I'd give this one a 4...but strongly advise adults (unless they saw it and loved it in 1985) to avoid it like the plague.By the way, if you do watch, note when Anne Ramsey yells at the kids ""The only thing we serve is tongue!"". It's ironic, as soon after she made the film, Ramsey lost much of her tongue due to cancer surgery!",The Goonies
1,TheLittleSongbird,"Great fun, and a childhood favourite of mine",8,7 December 2009,"The Goonies, what a fun movie. I will admit Richard Donner's direction was a little too leisurely and there are some parts in the middle half that are too slow and falls dangerously into cloying sentimentality. Still this childhood favourite of mine is great fun from beginning to end. No matter how thin the story is, it has an intriguing premise and Donner and Chris Columbus keep the action going strong and the adventure fun enough for the younger audience. The script is funny and affectionate, the music is memorable and in general the special effects are good. The image of the pirate ship was mind blowing and the cinematography and costumes are very well done. The performances are very good; while Sean Astin and Corey Feldman are the standouts of the child cast, it is Anne Ramsey who steals the show as Ma Fetali in a effortlessly over the top and deliciously evil performance, very like Diana Dors in The Amazing Mr Blunden. All in all, a fun adventure yarn. 8/10 Bethany Cox",The Goonies
2,bkoganbing,One Eyed Willie's Treasure,8,14 June 2017,"I find it interesting that while no film has been made to be a sequel to The Goonies, 3 different video games were derived from this film. Not surprising in that the film itself resembles a video game in that private little world a bunch of kids called The Goonies find beneath an abandoned seaside restaurant on the Pacific coast.The head of the gang is young Sean Astin and acting like a den brother is older sibling Josh Brolin when he's not trying to get something going with Martha Plimpton. Among the rest of the gang is Kerri Green, Jonathan Ke Quan, Corey Feldman, and Jeff Cohen.The kids have an old map found dusty and forgotten in the attic of Astin and Brolin. But also at the same time Anne Ramsey a current Ma Barker has busted one of her Rhodes Scholar sons out of the local jail and they find the abandoned restaurant a most convenient hiding place. So while the kids hunt for the treasure of legendary pirate One Eyed Willie, another group of kids chasing them, the bad guys chasing them all and the law looking for the bad guys, it's all a merry chase.Going below that restaurant the Goonies find an adventure that would be the envy of Indiana Jones filled with all kinds of traps and devices to kill or at least discourage. Obvious that Steven Spielberg borrowed liberally from that film of his to use for this one with juvenile appeal.The Goonies after over 30 years is still great family entertainment. What could be better than watching kids on a pulp adventure they only read and dream about.Kids of all ages.",The Goonies
3,Leofwine_draca,"Well-remembered, but hardly a classic",6,6 April 2013,"Having seen THE GOONIES when I grew up during the 1980s, I remember it fondly: a kind of Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew/Enid Blyton-style adventure put on the big screen, filled with excitement and danger and the kind of anything-goes mentality that made Spielberg films hits during that decade. Watching it now, as an adult, I'm slightly disappointed; the performances of a lot of the kids are shouty and grating rather than endearing, and despite the plentiful nods and jokes for the adults in the script, it just isn't as inventive as I recalled. In many ways this is simply an Indiana Jones film made specially for the kiddies.Still, there's plenty to love here, not least Richard Donner's focused direction and, of course, the hulking giant that is Sloth, who dominates all of his scenes. The villains are decent too: Robert Davi gets to show off some comic flair (and singing skills) but the real star is the irascible Anne Ramsey, who of course went on to greater fame in THROW MOMMA FROM THE TRAIN. There's also undeniable charm in seeing familiar child stars of the era (Jonathan Ke Quan, Corey Feldman) alongside those who have become better known as adult actors (Sean Astin and Josh Brolin).The imaginative plot elements include treasure maps, pirate ships, deadly traps, dead bodies and criminal gangs, but it's the central bonding of the Goonies themselves that holds it all together and keeps it so watchable. Maybe this is no classic, but it's still a good time",The Goonies
4,SnoopyStyle,Childhood joyous adventure,8,13 July 2014,"Mama Fratelli (Anne Ramsey) and son Francis (Joe Pantoliano) breaks other son Jake (Robert Davi) out of county jail. They are holed up in the abandoned cliffside restaurant with the deformed Sloth. Meanwhile everybody in the town of Astoria is being forced to leave as developers are coming to tear everything down for a country club. Mikey (Sean Astin) and his brother Brand (Josh Brolin) as well as klutzy Chunk (Jeff Cohen), Mouth (Corey Feldman), and Data (Jonathan Ke Quan) with his gadgets go digging through the attic. Mikey finds a map to One Eyed Willy's treasure. The boys tie Brand up and go off on their Goonies adventure to find the treasure. The boys end up at the cliffside restaurant where they run into the Fratellis. There Brand finally catches up to them. Cheerleader Andy (Kerri Green) and her friend Stef (Martha Plimpton) follows them and gets pulled in on the adventure of a lifetime.It's a fun movie. That's its appeal. It has the essence of childhood joy. The kids are a fun bunch. They have exciting adventures. Steven Spielberg is the producer. Chris Columbus is the writer. Richard Donner is the director. It owes most of its sensibility to Spielberg. It's essentially ET with a pirate treasure rather than an alien. I do have a minor warning for really small kids. The language, the action and a dead body could be a little bit too much for the little ones. It's not really a kiddie movie for the tiny tods.",The Goonies
5,Horst_In_Translation,"Solid kids adventure, but not a classic",6,14 September 2015,"""The Goonies"" celebrates its 30th anniversary this year and I must say it hasn't aged as badly as some other films from the 1980s, yet it's not an outstanding movie by any means. Lets take a look at cast & crew first of all: Spielberg of course became an Academy Award winning superstar, but also many others achieved great things in their careers long after this film. Feldman became one of the defining kids actors of his generation. Brolin is an Oscar nominee. So is Sean Astin apart from starring in the epic ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy. Ramsey became an Oscar nominee the same year that this one came out. Columbus is an Oscar nominee too. Plimpton and Pantoliano are Emmy winners. Ontiveros is an Emmy nominee. Davy became a really good Bond villain. So there is certainly lots of talent united in this film.Unfortunately, these almost 2 hours (fairly long for a kids movie) did not turn out a 100% successful movie. There are some nice scenes in terms of adventure, comedy etc. for example the one when Chunk tells that he knows who the 3 villains are and can describe them to the police unknowingly that he is talking to them, but there are some bad moments too, like in the end when the father tears the contract into pieces. A classic example of overacting and there are more of these when the script simply tries to be too ambitious for its own good. Another example would be the meaningful speech by Astin's character down in the cave. So yeah, not a bad watch by any means, but not a truly epic children's movie either as many people consider it. Something in-between. All in all, I recommend it, but one watch is enough. Actually I am a bit surprised they never made a sequel for this one just like they did for many other very famous 80 films, for example ""Back into the Future"". Oh well, probably for the better I guess.",The Goonies
6,claudio_carvalho,Nostalgic Adventure,7,7 September 2020,"The criminal Jake (Robert Davi) escapes from the jail with the support of his brother Francis (Joe Pantoliano) and his mother Mama Fratelli (Anne Ramsey). Meanwhile a group of boys called The Goonies that will be evicted from their homes in Goon Docks since their parents were not capable to pay the mortgage of their houses meet each other in the house of the brothers Mikey Walsh (Sean Astin) and Brand (Josh Brolin) to celebrate the last day together. When they go to the attic, Mikey finds the map of the treasure of the pirate One Eyed Willis's and he shows to his friends Data (Ke Huy Quan), Chunk (Jeff Cohen) and Mouth (Corey Feldman). They decide to seek out the treasure to save their homes but they find that the location is the hideout of the Fratelli family. Soon they team up with their friends Andy (Kerri Green) and Stef (Martha Plimpton) but they are hunted down by the Fratelli family that wants the treasure for themselves.""The Goonies"" is a nostalgic adventure produced and written by Steven Spielberg and directed by Richard Donner in 1985. Probably most children and parents in those years have watched this film. There are unforgettable scenes, like for example Mouth translating to Spanish the instruction from Mrs. Walsh to Rosalita or Jake crossing his fingers to protect from the attack of bats in the cave. In the present days, the greatest attraction is to see the cast when they were younger and younger. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Os Goonies"" (""The Goonies"")",The Goonies
7,Sleepin_Dragon,"The ultimate feel good, fun adventure.",10,11 June 2019,"If ever there was an advert for just how good adventure films were from the 1980's, this is it. Enormously entertaining, funny, moving, and just plain old fashioned adventure. The Goonies stands up even today, superbly made, well acted, and it's one of those films, that never fails to entertain, it stands the test of time, and never disappoints.I love the effects, and the music is so good. I love the cast, they all deserve a mention, but as was so often the case, Angelina Ramsey, Mama Fratelli, just fabulous.Definitely there was a social message in it, but it never overtakes the film, they're a group of kids having an adventure.Awesome. 10/10",The Goonies
8,classicsoncall,"""Hey guys, if we don't get out of here soon, there's gonna be a hostage crisis"".",8,5 November 2011,"I have to admit right up front, when I first saw this picture, I thought Ma Fratelli (Anne Ramsey) was a man, and I wasn't a kid at the time. Using the term ugly would be too cruel to describe her appearance knowing now that she was a she, but boy, I just couldn't get over her characterization. The voice didn't help either.Well anyway, ""The Goonies"" is the embodiment of the kind of film one likes to look back on and reminisce about their own youthful experiences. For me, it summons up the adventure of my Scouting days hiking and camping, swimming and diving off Catfish Rock, and just the general camaraderie of hanging out with friends you'd like to stay young with forever. Back in the Fifties, you didn't have many fat kids around like Chunk because we were always outside running around instead of playing video games, so that's one concession I have to give the picture. 'Hey you guuuu-uys!' must be universal, because we used that as a rally cry whenever it was time to get together, which was just about every day after school and on the weekends.Our adventures of course could never match the one in ""The Goonies"", and we didn't have to watch out for characters like One Eyed Willie or Chester Copperpot. Or Sloth. But that's the fun of the picture, seeing how the gang gets into and out of their scrapes, coming of age, and triumphing in the end to win out over the bad guys and their own insecurities. If you're young or just young at heart, ""The Goonies"" offers up a fun time that captures the spirit of being alive, because after all, Goonies never say die!",The Goonies
9,gavin6942,One of the 1980s' Best Films,10,4 May 2014,"A group of kids set out on an adventure in search of pirate treasure that could save their homes from foreclosure.Growing up in the 1980s, this is one of those films that sticks with you. Everyone saw it a dozen or more times, and it remains flawless in almost every way. When you have the three person team of Spielberg-Donner-Columbus running the show, it is no shock that you end up with a top-notch children's adventure film.Unfortunately, Corey Feldman went on to become one of the most notorious bottom feeders in Hollywood... but at least we had Sean Astin's career going up to make up for that. And Josh Brolin.",The Goonies
10,lee_eisenberg,octopus...octopus...,4,6 February 2006,"OK, ""The Goonies"" is cool for pure entertainment value, but otherwise it's kinda lousy. This story of several Astoria kids hunting for long-lost treasure to keep from getting evicted isn't half-bad if you accept as a straight popcorn flick. But they really could have done without that whole ""...we're on an adventure and it'll be ruined if we go up there with them..."" sequence.Ah, and of course there's the octopus - or rather, there wasn't in the original movie, even though Richard ""Data"" Wang (Ke Huy Quan) mentioned it. I bet that when the movie first came out, people were wondering ""What octopus?"". Apparently, some TV versions include the octopus scene. When I saw ""The Goonies"" on Joe Bob Briggs's show ""Monstervision"", he explained that the octopus scene was edited out of the theatrical version.All in all, there's nothing particularly bad about this movie; just a few unnecessary scenes. We now may recognize Francis Fratelli as Joe Pantoliano, who co-starred in ""The Matrix"", ""Memento"" and ""The Sopranos"". Mama Fratelli was of course Anne Ramsey, aka Danny DeVito's mother in ""Throw Momma from the Train"". The kids were mostly brat-packers, so most of them seem to have disappeared since ""The Goonies"".It's weird to think. Richard Donner went from directing a ""Gilligan's Island"" episode, to ""Superman"", to ""The Goonies"", to ""Lethal Weapon"". The things that we see in life.",The Goonies
11,jboothmillard,The Goonies,6,4 September 2006,"This is one of those 80's family films that probably gets talked about a lot, and I suppose rightly so, from writer Chris Columbus (Gremlins), producer and writer Steven Spielberg (E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, Back to the Future), and director Richard Donner (The Omen, Superman, Lethal Weapon). Basically the neighbourhood of ""Goon Docks"" in Astoria, Oregon is threatened by developers who want to buy the area for a golf course, unless enough money is raised to stop the construction, Michael 'Mikey' (The Lord of the Rings' Sean Astin) and his friends Lawrence 'Chunk' Cohen (Jeff Cohen), Clark 'Mouth' Devereaux (Stand by Me's Corey Feldman) and Richard 'Data' Wang (Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom's Jonathan Ke Quan) are hoping to find a way to stop it from happening. It is while rummaging through old stuff in the attic that Mikey finds what looks like the treasure map of the famous and legendary pirate One-Eyed Willie, he is sure that it leads to a hidden fortune, so he and his friends, who call themselves The Goonies, set out on a quest following this map in the hope of finding the valuable treasure to save the neighbourhood. Along the way though the Goonies get themselves in trouble getting too close to a family of fugitives, the Fratellis, the brothers Jake (Licence to Kill's Robert Davi) and Francis (Memento's Joe Pantoliano), Mama Fratelli (Throw Momma from the Train's Anne Ramsey), with Chunk ending up their hostage for a little while, however the hideous looking but much nicer member of the family, deformed brother Lotney 'Sloth' Fratelli (John Matuszak), helps him out. Mikey, Mouth and Data are eventually joined by Brand, as well as Andrea 'Andy' Carmichael (Kerri Green), and Stefanie 'Stef' Steinbrenner (Parenthood's Martha Plimpton), and they follow the map through a series of underground caverns, with many booby traps along the way to try and stop them in their tracks. They manage however to get through all the traps and reach the large pirate ship, getting on board Mikey is beaming to see the skeleton of One-Eyed Willie, the Fratellis try to steal the treasure for themselves, but with the help of Chunk and Sloth the Goonies manage to defeat the bad guys, and in the end they get a bunch of valuable jewels out of pocket in time before the signature for the construction is put down. Also starring Lupe Ontiveros as Rosalita, Mary Ellen Trainor as Mrs. Walsh, Keith Walker as Mr. Walsh, Charles McDaniel as Chunk's Father, Elaine Cohen McMahon as Chunk's Mother, Falling Down's Michael Paul Chan as Data's Father and Nick McLean as Mouth's Father. All the young leads are a likable bunch with their individual characteristics, Ramsey, Davi and Pantoliano are good exaggerated villains, the story is definitely inspired by the Raiders of the Lost Ark with all the effects and scenery to create a child friendly romp, an entertaining adventure. It was number 24 on The 100 Greatest Family Films. Good!",The Goonies

13,BA_Harrison,It must be a nostalgia thing,3,11 May 2014,"I have friends who grew up in the 80s who swear that The Goonies is one of the greatest adventure films ever made. Being in my late teens at the time, I was a little too old to be interested when it first came out, and having finally caught up with the film nearly thirty years later, I can definitely say that I'm waaaay too old for it now. Although I'm usually a sucker for films involving the search for long lost treasure, this noisy, chaotic, poorly acted, desperately unfunny, unexciting waste of a big budget had me wishing I'd never bothered to see what the fuss was all about.When the most comprehensible lines of dialogue in the whole film come from a mentally disabled, drooling freak called Sloth and a character played by Anne Ramsey, then I know I'm in for a rough time. Quite why Spielberg and Donner opted for such an obnoxious collection of unruly brats for this film I'll never understand, the kids' incessant unintelligible screaming seriously grating on the nerves. Until now, I've always had time for Corey Feldman and Sean Astin, but here they are mostly unbearable; even worse are Ke Huy Quan as amateur inventor Data and loud-mouthed tub of lard Chunk, played by Jeff Cohen, both of whom deliver utterly charmless performances.If, like me, you've successfully avoided seeing this film for several decades, I suggest that you keep on doing so and save yourself the disappointment.",The Goonies
14,moonspinner55,"""Goonies"" not good enough...",3,2 August 2009,"From the Steven Spielberg school, a calamitous kid-fracas which was inexplicably popular in its day, now a faded hit dressed with product placements and dated topical references. Spurred on by their dad's pirate-memorabilia collection in the attic--and with foreclosure hanging over their parents' heads--two brothers and their juvenile friends hope an ancient treasure map will lead them to One-Eyed Willie's buried fortune; an escaped convict and his brood are after it, too. A grab-bag of ideas, each one a surefire audience-pleaser (if you're under 12). Jeff Cohen, as ""Chunk"" (the chunky kid), is stereotypically clumsy and food-crazy (the other kids make him jiggle his fat before they'll let him in the house); Sean Astin is the dreamy, talkative boy whose braces keep glinting in the movie lights; Josh Brolin is the oldest kid who is pulled into the mystery against his will; Kerri Green and Martha Plimpton are the token girls (who squeal far less than the guys). None of these young actors give actual performances as much as they do mouth-off--sometimes all at once!--while director Richard Donner just keeps the cameras rolling.

Why? Well, because the movie was and still is fun for all ages to sit down and watch. Plus it is a very memorable movie as well.The storyline in ""The Goonies"" is something that appeals to adults and youngsters alike. There simply is something for just about everyone in the audience for this 1985 movie by writers Chris Columbus and Steven Spielberg, and director Richard Donner.I thoroughly enjoyed the adventure back in the mid-1980s, and I just sat down to watch the movie again in 2020 with my 10 year old son, and the movie was every bit as exciting, adventurous and entertaining now as it was back in the day. So you can definitely say that ""The Goonies"" is a timeless movie.And having grown up with movies, it definitely is a fun experience and a blast to watch a young cast in ""The Goonies"" that includes the likes of Sean Astin, Josh Brolin, Corey Feldman, Martha Plimpton, Robert Davi, Joe Pantoliano and Anne Ramsey to mention but the most recognizable of faces and names.""The Goonies"" definitely have that ""Indiana Jones"" feel to it, and that is most certainly something that I enjoyed back in the mid-1980s watching ""The Goonies"" and being about 10 years old then. And the adventure in the movie is, again, something that has an appeal to children and adults alike.If you have never seen ""The Goonies"", then you most certainly should take the time to do so, if you get the opportunity.

17,Scarecrow-88,The Goonies,7,29 January 2011,"Loud kids, always talking over each other, going on a treasure hunt coming in contact with two criminals, their mentally deformed(mistreated and humongous)brother, and bossy mother..that's pretty much the plot. Asthmatic Sean Astin and his big brother(always working out)are about to lose their home and their neighborhood friends decide to look for the treasure of an old pirate whose map they find in the attic. To be honest I was inspired for some reason to watch this after revisiting STAND BY ME for the first time since I was a teenager. THE GOONIES is raucus and busy, with kids bucking for their time on screen. A cast of child actors, some of whom would become successful adult actors(particularly Josh Brolin, with Astin would hitting paydirt with RUDY and the Lord of the Rings movies), I'm not sure how director Richard Donner escaped unscathed without a stint in the nuthouse. Entering into my thirties, I have been on a nostalgia trip and this movie, truth be told, was more fitting to when I was 10, now as a father I deal with kids like these and so I shutter instead of necessarily grin with affection for these wild brats. Oh, I'm no curmudgeon, these kids are near and dear to my heart--I was their age when this movie was made and had a little brat in me as well, but I'd be lying if I didn't admit that a lot of the noise become a bit of an annoyance. Not too irritating, mind you, but putting together this many kids, crowding scenes with overlapping dialogue, can be a bit much from time to time. The energy and enthusiasm, though, is viable and rubbed off on me yet again, as always..I can not deny that. As you might expect, the Spielbergian schmaltz is laid on thick with the whole foreclosure subplot and how the Goon Docks kids ban together for one last great adventure hoping to save their home from being knocked down. Who'd of thought that caves were underneath the city containing booby traps with falling rocks, floors that fall away, skeletons galore, and even a pirate ship--those Warner Bros sets are utilized to the hilt. Even One-Eyed Willie makes an appearance. Kids should eat this up for generations to come even if we ourselves eventually grow up and find it less effective. Sloth and Chunk(with food always on the brain) are quite a pair, Mama's misbegotten(she dropped him on his face twice after giving birth to him, hence the facial malformations and child-like sensibilities)son becoming the hero at the end. Astin is the driving force behind the hunt, always motivating the pack to pursue the grand prize which might save Goon Docks. Feldman, as usual, is the obnoxious wisecracker whose use of the Spanish language is pretty funny, particularly what he tells the maid who can speak no English. I've got to be honest--Cyndi Lauper's titular song for the movie is awfully catchy.",The Goonies
18,Hey_Sweden,Good enough for me.,7,2 August 2020,"Working from a story by executive producer Steven Spielberg, screenwriter Chris Columbus (""Gremlins"") and director Richard Donner (""Superman: The Movie"") here fashioned an appealing old-time adventure for kids and the young at heart. A bunch of rambunctious kids in a small town are due to lose their homes to stereotypically sleazy developers. But in the attic of Mikey (Sean Astin) and Brand (Josh Brolin), they find a map that will supposedly lead them to a legendary pirates' long-lost treasure. They then embark on an underground adventure with no small amount of peril to endure. All the while, they're pursued by a family of criminals including Mama (Anne Ramsey), Jake (Robert Davi), and Francis (Joe Pantoliano).Although this viewer didn't really see this in its entirety until he was himself an adult, it still worked quite well, thanks to lively filmmaking from Donner and company, a cracking pace, an assortment of elaborate ""booty"" traps, and an engaging bunch of kid actors, some of them making their feature film debuts. It's a true marvel of production design (by J. Michael Riva), set decoration, and cinematography (by Nick McLean, who also cameos as Mouths' father). The score (mostly by Dave Grusin) is also appropriately rousing, perfect for a movie that involves a bit of swashbuckling at the end. This is spirited entertainment with a healthy amount of humour; Mouths' instructions to Rosalita (Lupe Ontiveros) and Chunks' confessions to the Fratellis are perfect examples. Columbus even works in a reference to ""Gremlins"" at one point.The talented ensemble also includes Corey Feldman as Mouth, Jeff Cohen (who opted not to continue in the acting business) as Chunk, Kerri Green as Andy, Martha Plimpton as Stef, and Ke Huy Quan as Data, the youngster who sees himself as a junior James Bond complete with (malfunctioning) gadgets. Top adult character actors and actresses (Ontiveros, Mary Ellen Trainor, Michael Paul Chan, Gene Ross) turn up as well, with an especially endearing role for pro footballer John Matuszak as the deformed Sloth, mistreated but kindhearted. It's too cute when his ears wiggle, or when he utters his memorable refrain of ""HEY, YOU GUYS!"".Although this is clearly an 80s product (complete with a fleeting appearance by the Cyndi Lauper music video for the theme song), this only adds to the appeal for anybody who grew up during that era.Seven out of 10.",The Goonies

An '80s classic full of humor, adventure, and heart. Great characters, fun story, lots of memorable lines and scenes. It's the kids adventure film all other kids adventure films should be judged by. There's not a flaw in the cast. The villains (Anne Ramsey, Joey Pants, Robert Davi) are all great fun, even when they're being evil. The Goonies (Sean Astin, Jeff Cohen, Corey Feldman, et al.) are one of the finest group of kid actors ever assembled in one movie. They all play off each other so well and each gives an authentic performance. Who doesn't love Mikey, Chunk, Mouth, or Data? Not to mention Sloth. These are all memorable and likable characters. The direction is excellent. The sets and special effects are extraordinary. It's just a phenomenal movie. A true classic in every sense.",The Goonies

All they have to go by is a several centuries-old map. As if things weren't already difficult enough, there's a band of hardened criminals after them too...A fairly uneven movie. Is a decent adventure with some great moments, especially comedic moments, and some rollicking good fun, but is also quite silly at times. There's so many scenes that are random at best and sub-plots that add nothing to the movie. Anything involving the character Chunk you knew would just be plain irritating and involve a lot of mindless screaming...Performances vary too. There are some stars-of-the-future in the cast - Josh Brolin, Sean Astin, Corey Feldman, Martha Plimpton - and they give solid performances. However, consistent with the irritating nature of the character he played, Jeff Cohen almost ruins the show as Chunk. Kids will love the movie.

Sure, they were cacophonous most of the time as a whole and individually Mikey was a little too pollyanna, Chunk a little too hungry, Mouth a little to wordy and Data... well I actually had no issue with Data, he was my favorite character.

Central plot regards a group of kids seeking out a treasure and a pirate ship. First issue regards the villains who are presented as juvenile morons for the family audience. Rather than be threatening and intriguing villains they are merely thugs and loud mouths. Many of the characters are interchangeable with the exception of Sean Astin who leads the group and has the spirit of adventure. Corey Feldman plays the rebellious friend very confrontational. Josh Brolin plays the standard older brother without personality. John Matuszak has the physical features to play Sloth who is kept chained up and eventually befriends the children. Kerri Green plays the ever familiar girlfriend material who will not realize it until the third act. Speaking of which, the climax and some of the humour is overly corny with images of decaying bodies that may be much for the intended audience. Director Richard Donner has created such great films as Superman: The Movie and The Omen. Here he presents a well made juvenile Indiana Jones adventure that may excite the imagination that we all had at that age as we sought out our own treasures. Score: 6 ½ / 10",The Goonies

The kids then encounter a family of crooks who also want the treasure, and won't stop at kidnapping or worse to get it. They eventually do find the ship in a secret underground lair, and must overcome the crooks and other menaces to claim the treasure.Though popular with kids, this film is exceedingly loud and obnoxious. Every line of dialogue is not spoken, but screamed; the characters are heavy handed and deafening, the action even more so.

A bunch of kids getting together find a map in the attic of one of the kids and they decide to see what they can find.  Meanwhile, some criminals are loose and they find out about the map as well later on as their hideout is the starting point.  A very good movie for kids, but it is just ok for adults, though it is a lot more watchable for adults than most of the kid oriented movies these days.  Though there are a few instances that may be to dark for the smaller tykes out there as there are a couple of dead bodies here and there.  Looking back at this movie, one thing is interesting.  When seeing this movie as a kid, it seemed like their adventure was really long and they were underground a bunch.  When I saw it later again, they really weren't in the underground chamber all that long. One thing though I would like to see is the octopus scene that was cut out of the movie, but the one kid refers to at the end (when the kid refers to it should have been cut out as well).",The Goonies

Must has already been written about the movie that defined many a childhood, but for me the director and cast commentary is more than worth the cost of getting a DVD player.

26,Sylviastel,It was a Movie for the 1980s!,9,26 August 2006,"I was watching the Goonies again. I wanted to be a Goonie in real life and live in Astoria, Oregon. The film is quirky about a bunch of kids who may be spending the last time together before their homes are torn down and made into a golf course for the country club of Astoria. It had a great cast especially young Sean Astin who really changed from being Mikey to the Frodo's pal in Lord of the Rings Trilogy 15 years later. Who would have thought that Josh Brolin who plays his older brother, Brand, would turn out to be Barbra Streisand's stepson? Martha Plimpton still acts as well. I don't know what happened to Kerri Green who played her friend. Corey Feldman had a difficult adolescence, his estranged relationship with Michael Jackson, his drug problems, and family problems as well. Jeff Cohen went on to college and I don't know what happened to the kid who played Data. Anne Ramsay has a great role as Mama Fratelli with her two sons, one who just escaped prison, and the other as his accomplice. She has a third son, Sloth, but he is locked up downstairs. The beginning sequence is always worth watching over and over again. The film shows lovely sequences of Astoria, Oregon which I have yet to visit but plan too sometime in my life. Anyway, the film was dedicated to Mama Fratelli and the actress who played her. By the end of Ramsay's life, this film and Throw Momma From the Train finally gave her recognition. Ramsay was battling throat cancer. She had tongue removed between films and she was a beloved character actress. I love this movie. It reminds me of my childhood and I wished that children would have that kind of childhood today and that's why I'm glad that I don't have children because I can't imagine them being in today's environment.",The Goonies
27,StevePulaski,More than good enough,9,13 January 2012,"The Goonies is right behind Stand By Me for best coming of age feature in the eighties. Stand By Me touched me in a way that I have never been touched before. It was an iconic, moving, intelligent picture than gave all four of its characters a believable history and insane likability. Not to mention, everything was raw, realistic, funny, touching, and sincere. It seems The Goonies borrows a few of the characters from the film, like Chunk who is clearly a lot like Jerry O'Connell's Vern in Stand By Me, but it makes them a lot more relatable for the youngsters and a lot cleaner and brighter in their personalities.The film centers around many, many kids that nickname themselves ""The Goonies"" who live in the ""Goon Docks"" of Arizona. Because of a growing country club, the house they all live in is heading towards foreclosure. The gang, made up of an optimistic asthmatic, a chubby coward, a mouthy youth, an Asian inventor, an older brother, a cheerleader, and a geeky female adolescent, discovers a map in one of their friends attic which tells the story of ""One-Eyed Willy"" and his untold amounts of treasure. The crew sets out to find the map and have one last Goonie adventure before they are separated.One of the many problems with this adventure are The Goonies themselves are being hunted by the Fratelli family, a group of thieves that are looking to steal treasure. The mother, or the boss, of the group is played by Anne Ramsey, an amazing and underrated character actor. She plays one of the creepiest, most taunting villains I can remember from a kids movie.It may sound like the teens are a bunch of caricatures, waiting to evolve into something bigger, badder, and more film-sustainable. But the characters are draw to look like mannequins, when in reality, they are portrayed effectively by great child character actors like Sean Astin, Jeff Cohen, and Corey Feldman. I think my favorite character was the lead, Mikey (Astin). His optimism reminded me of my own - as a young kid of course - and his overall cheery nature made him a very efficient protagonist.Obviously, the film is trying to mirror and duplicate the Indiana Jones for a younger, more pint-sized audience. It succeeds. There's enough wit, soul, and entertainment in the script and in the antics to keep fresh, while at the same time pay a thrilling homage. The sequences of peril are excellent, and the music always excites and compliments the scenes in true, Spielbergian style.The scene that has the best music is late in the film when the gang is sliding down a long water-slide that's not meant for sliding. It's complimented with exciting music, but also captures the innocence of doing something so bad then so good. It's difficult to explain, but you might realize it when you see it. Think of doing something bad, then doing something very fun, exciting, and somewhat dangerous. Like after you break something, you dart up the stairs jumping over obstacles and dodging everything like a stuntman.The Goonies is nothing but a fun, Spielberg adventure of epic proportions. This is also one of the coming of age films that furthers my sadness of the fact I have not had anywhere close to an adventure like this, nor have I had the loyal friends of this caliber. I believe that's because my life isn't a nostalgic eighties film.Starring: Sean Astin, Josh Brolin, Jeff Cohen, Corey Feldman, Kerri Green, Martha Plimpton, Jonathan Ke Quan, and Anne Ramsey.

28,Smells_Like_Cheese,Probably the coolest adventure movie of all time!,10,13 June 2002,"The Goonies is eternally a terrific movie that anyone could easily fall in love with. I was a little surprised honestly that this movie isn't on the top 250, because it seems like everyone agrees with me that this is just a plain excellent movie. After all, it is directed by Steven Spielberg, when has he ever misled us? I think this movie is sort of like a time capsule, because you can tell that it was made in the 80's, but it'll forever remain a treasure that will pass on from generation to the next.It's about these pre-teen boys who are about to loose their houses to the local rich guys who will turn their houses into a golf course if their parents don't come up with the money that's wanted. When Mikey, the leader of the Goonies, gets his hands on his father's treasure map that belongs to his museum, he shows his friends, including his older brother, Brandon, that maybe this could be their last adventure to find the treasure and pay off the rich guys! Brandon, his girlfriend, Andy, her friend, Steph, Mouth, Data, Chunk, and Mikey come together to find the treasure. But it's gonna be hard when on the run Fratelli's want the treasure as well and will try to get there first! The Goonies are just so lovable and I would always recommend this not only for the family, but for yourself as well. Because it has great lines, exciting scenes, and just a fantastic story. Not to mention all the future stars who are in this film like Sean Astin, Corey Feldman, and Robert Davi.

30,Red-Barracuda,One for fans of all things 80's,6,6 January 2010,"I didn't really watch movies as a youngster back in the 80's so I never saw this as a child, therefore, the whole cult of The Goonies is something that has simply passed me by. It seems to be one of those 80's movies that has a certain nostalgic power over those who saw it back in the day. I can only imagine that the reason for this is primarily down to the kids themselves, as the film is fairly generic and not overly original otherwise. But the boys do act in an unusual way for a movie aimed at children. They swear, make sexual innuendos and joke about hard drugs. So I suppose they act similar to how kids do in real life and I am supposing this is a major reason for the film's enduring appeal. It's not as saccharine as most family movies.It also has Corey Feldman in it, which I guess for some people gives a movie a certain 80's seal of approval. I noticed that the hobbit fella was part of the Goonie gang too. And the little Chinese bloke from Temple of Doom. Leaving the fat funny one who was probably the best thing about the film. It was also nice to see an old favourite of mine, Cyndi Lauper singing the catchy title tune. She really was great.I'm not going to detail the story as anyone reading this will surely know it already. But suffice to say, the film moves along at a cracking pace and does not outstay its welcome. The film has Spielberg Production written all over it and that is certainly not always a good thing. But it's actually really quite difficult to dislike this movie as it does possess a certain 80's charm.",The Goonies
31,ElMaruecan82,"The missing link between ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" and ""Stand by Me""...",8,31 July 2016,"And it's a fitting coincidence that it stars Ke Huy Quan, the kid who loved Indy one year before, and Corey Feldman who didn't want to be called crazy, the year after.But it's not just a matter of chronology, ""The Goonies"" marks a climactic point in the 80's with all the craze for youth-oriented escapism and more-or-less comedic adventure movies, released the year of ""Back to the Future"" and when Steven Spielberg and Chris Columbus combined their talents again to make ""Young Sherlock Holmes"". I just watched this film a few days ago and looking at ""The Goonies"" again, I was thinking of that moment where Watson and Holmes are about to ride a sort of flying bicycle for the first time, a scared Watson asks ""where have I gotten myself into?"" to which Holmes answers ""the adventure of a lifetime"".The more I think of this sublime exchange, the more I appreciate its resonance in the very context of the 80's, and more specifically when Richard Donner directed ""The Goonies"". Movies were all about 'adventures of a lifetime' in that glorious decade, inaugurated with the iconic images of Indiana Jones escaping a giant boulder, children flying away from the Police to get ""E.T"" back home and so forth. The Goonies are like Elliott's friends playing Indiana Jones, living an adventure whose quest might not be as noble as in ""E.T."" (it's a treasure, something tangible like in Indiana Jones) but it does carry some symbolic value like living the last adventure before one of them leaves the town, enjoying youth, or less pompously: to have fun. And even if some of them, like the big brother Brand (Josh Brolin) or the two girls (Kerri Green and Martha Plimpton) wonder where they've gotten themselves into, they stick together nonetheless and enjoy (once again) the 'adventure of a lifetime'.And I think the reason why the film isn't as humanistic as ""E.T."" and borrows more from the 'Indiana Jones"" franchise is because Spielberg didn't want to make some sort of hymn to childhood, which explains why for the sake of realism, there's a lot of profanity and many moments where kids talk and shout at the same time and it's barely audible. Despite some similarities, we're far from the universe of Tom Sawyer and Hucklberry Finn where the two boys quietly wandered on the Mississippi River and where Injun Joe was really scary. In ""The Goonies"", there's no room for 'drama-realism' or 'dreamy-humanism' and Spielberg and Donner inject as many archetypes as possible. Sean Astin is Mikey, the voice of reason, the leader, the one who needs the treasure the most so his Dad can keep their house so it's not just about greed. He also respects the Pirate One-Eyed Willy, Mouth is the comic relief, Data is the nerd and Chunk (Jeff Cohen) is the fat insecure kid.And there are also a bunch of Italian-American gangsters, the Fratellis, played by Robert Davi and Joe Pantaliano, and Anne Ramsey's as their scary-looking Mama, the Fratellis contribute to one of the best moments of the film, the opening chase sequence and its catchy theme, and the hidden (and hideous) third brother Sloth (John Matuszak) would have felt like a gratuitous addition if his relationship with Chunk wasn't so touching and poignant. Only two outcasts can understand each other, the Fratellis and the Goonies were already outcasts, but when you're the fat, clumsy, talkative and misunderstood kid of the bunch (no way to go through life), maybe it takes a criminal Family's offspring who looks like a cross between Quasimodo and a Garbage Pail Kid to become your friend. In some weird twisted way, there are some Elliott-E.T. vibes in that relationship between Chunk and Sloth but I wonder if Steven Spielberg didn't mean that in a self-parodying way.Indeed, ""The Goonies"" is action-packed, filled with chases, screams, long slides, booby traps, romantic kisses in the dark, scary cadavers and skeletons, it's perhaps the most blatantly and shamelessly adventurous film of the 80's involving kids before a change of settings in 1986 with ""Stand By Me"". In Rob Reiner's film, the kids' quest will carry more macabre undertones, they go to find a body and get some publicity, but in the end, they choose the wisest solution and call the Police, it's the ultimate coming-of-age film. Kids grow up, their maturity also conveys the feeling of a lost innocence, emphasized by the epilogue that gives away the fates of the protagonists, and not all of them are pleasing. The 80's slowly slide toward the 90's realism so ""The Goonies"" is the last hurrah of kids-oriented movie, the same year where Marty McFly visits the past, where we get to the past of Holmes and Watson, the Goonies visit the past of their town Astoria, and fix one thing or two in their lives.In a way, it's like Spielberg revisiting his own childhood and translating his memories into the film. Of course, his perfectionism was more palpable in ""E.T"" which had a personal meaning and he directed it himself. There's some naivety in the way kids behave in ""The Goonies"", trying to sound too cool and too smart at the expenses of realism, but the film is so fast-paced and so oblivious to these subtleties that we ready to accept it's not ""E.T."" and enjoy it for what it is. And maybe that's the secret of its everlasting appeal, more than 30 years after, improved by the nostalgia effect, the same than can make us enjoy a film like ""Police Academy"". So, ""The Goonies"" might have too many 80's actors, too many recognizable Spielberg's tricks, hell, even a Cindy Lauper song, but maybe these dating factors are the film's saving graces, making it forever a part of the most fun cinematic decade.""Never say die"", like they say",The Goonies

It's this weird mix of the oddly serious and almost sinister (including a number of dead bodies) with the slapstick - sometimes downright silly - and sentimental that hinders the flick just a bit. It's too childish for adults, yet too adult for children. Perhaps, however, that's why it was so loved in the first place.

38,The-Sarkologist,A Classic 80s Adventure,9,3 May 2020,"This is one delightful movie, one that I remember watching when I was a kid. In fact I have seen it a few times, though am sort of baffled as to why I haven't reviewed it yet. I guess it was a good thing that my Friday Night zoom party decided that they would watch this one. Mind you, it was my recommendation, and I certainly get rather anxious when people agree to watch a movie that I choose, but it certainly went down quite well, so I glad about that.The film is set probably in Oregon, or someplace like that, but it is a seaside town and it is certainly quite rainy. Then again, considering that there does happen to be a pirate involved, I'm more inclined to believe that it is in New England or some place like that. Anyway, the local country club is expanding, and buying up all the property, and a bunch of kids look like they are going to be split up. However, while searching the attic they discover an old map to a buried treasure, and as such a treasure hunt ensures.It was suggested that there was a lot of elements of Home Alone in this film, namely because we have this group of eccentric crooks, one of whom has just escaped from gaol. The kids stumble upon their hideout, namely because the treasure map leads them straight there, and while attempting to escape, they discover a hidden passage, full of traps, that eventually lead them to the treasure. Yeah, so it is basically an adventure film, and is also a bit of a comedy as well.I can certainly see where Stranger Things got some inspiration from, since there were also a lot of elements in this film that appeared in the series. However, this certainly isn't a scary film, just rather a bunch of kids, and of course the teenagers that have been caught up in the adventure as well, attempting to find their way out of the cave system, and also attempting to find the treasure. Of course, there is a bit of a debate as to what they want to do, but of course the treasure hunt overides everything, particularly since they are attempting to get their house off of the country club.Another thing that I noticed is that while it is generally a kids movie, there are certainly some subtle elements that would no doubt appeal to adults, such as the scene with Michelangelo's David at the beginning of the film, and of course the guy who speaks fluent Spanish that acts as an interpreter for the house maid. Yeah, there is certainly a lot of things that work well in this film, and in a way it has still aged relatively well too.

Joining him is Data (Jonathan Ke Quan), who is handy with gadgets, Mouth (Corey Feldman), who always lets his mouth get the better of him, and Chunk (Jeff Cohen), a bungling chubby kid who is famous for his 'truffle shuffle'. Meeting up with them later is Mikey's older brother Brand (Josh Brolin) and two girls, Andy (Kerri Green) and Stef (Martha Plimpton). The map leads them to a seaside restaurant that appears derelict, but they soon find it occupied by wanted criminals who may just be after the loot themselves.So here it is. When we started the Childhood Memories Project, The Goonies was always high on the list to watch, and why wouldn't it be? Virtually everyone from my generation and the generations around me who owned a television when they were a kid would have seen this film many times, and, like me, loved it. It seemed to be constantly on one of the channels, and is the type of film that you can watch from any point and instantly become engrossed. It has everything a kids film could need - pirates, lost treasure, adventure, boys comradery, monsters (well, Sloth). And it has a sad element that could upset any child - the threat of moving away to the unknown and leaving those childhood friends forever. These things make the film timeless, and a true childhood classic.This was the first time I'd watched the film since my youth, and the first thing that struck me was how dark the film is. There's some scary stuff in here (if you're a kid!) - skeletal bodies, a frozen corpse with a bullet hole in his head, a huge deformed monster chained in a dark room, and Martha Plimpton. There's also a lot of swearing. It's not the type of thing you get in modern day kiddy s**t. Those films are too busy breaking into song or filling the screen with flashy effects to stop the X-Box and iPhone generation from losing concentration for 10 seconds and checking their f*****g Facebook account. The Goonies gives us the real dirt, danger and sense of adventure that came with childhood, where an abandoned railway line would provide a whole day's entertainment (in my case).I also found it extremely moving. I'm not sure if it was the nostalgic man-child in me that was transported back to a time where getting back home in time for dinner was the extent of my worries, or if it was from the many beers that I had. Either way, by the end I got all soppy. The Goonies is by no means a brilliant film, but the legacy it left behind it and the sheer scale of it's cult, nostalgic fan base is there for a reason - because it's the perfect childhood adventure film. And for that reason, and for the fact that I've never felt two hours fly by so fast, I'm giving the film five stars. This is the film that gave us the truffle shuffle and 'hey you guys!' after all. I just hope younger generations get to see it and are capable of appreciating it after being brought up in a world of Pirates of the Caribbean sequels, Miley Cyrus and Michael f*****g Bay.

41,Thanos_Alfie,A great adventure...,8,11 August 2014,"""The Goonies"" is a great family movie which combines very well comedy with adventure. This movie has to do with a group of children who are trying to find a pirate treasure but in their way they will find plenty of tasks and difficulties which have to get over and continue.I liked very much this movie because it has a very nice plot and the acting of children are simply hilarious. Especially I liked very much the interpretation of Sean Astin who played as Mikey and of course the interpretation of Jonathan Ke Quan who played as Data and in my opinion he is one of the best in this movie.Finally I have to say that the direction of Richard Donner was simply outstanding such the writing of Steven Spielberg was.",The Goonies
42,eddie_baggins,Movies don't get anymore fun than this,10,16 March 2014,"What is one's childhood without The Goonies? It's a childhood that misses out on unquestionably one of the most purely enjoyable and unbridled joyous adventures ever committed to screen and a movie that to this day stands the test of time thanks to it's witty script, fantastic child actors and a story that unlocks the adventurer that hopefully dwells within all of us.Coming from the great mind that is Steven Spielberg and directed by Superman/Lethal Weapon helmer Richard Donner The Goonies was and is the perfect melding of the Hardie Boys come to life and an adventure that is impossible not to enjoy. Much of the film's success lies in its un-tapping of what is essentially a longing in all of us young and old to discover treasure whether figuratively or metaphorically and the journey that our young ""Goonies"" take is the embodiment of this.Lead by the wise beyond his years and future Sam from Lord of the Rings Sean Astin as Mikey the group consists of the teenager older brother Brand (a young Brolin), wisecracking Mouth (an on form Feldman), poor old fat kid Chunk (Cohen), Asian inventor extraordinaire Data (Temple of Doom's Ke Quan) and female tagalongs Andy (Green) and Stef (Plimpton). This group presents one of the most fully formed and memorable gangs in cinema history a gang that can sit proudly along with the Breakfast Club, The Sandlot gang or any other iconic group of young adults. The gang's journey is given heart thanks to the meaning behind there want of riches, the want to save their homes and there friendships from being torn down by greedy land developers. The team behind The Goonies literally struck gold with the casting in this picture with a young cast many a film would die for and who are strongly supported by one of the nastiest screen family's your likely to see in the form of the Fratelli's who lock up their own disfigured brother ""Sloth"" (played by former NFL participant John Matuszak) who becomes a star of the movie.All the great casting in the world would not of made The Goonies such a classic if it were not for the playfulness the film finds in its traps and contraptions. The film is brimming to life with practical and special effects that hearken back to an almost teenage version of an Indiana Jones fable with skeletons, spikes, waterslides and pirate ships littering the scenery giving the film a sense of realism that would be lost today in a myriad of overused and unconvincing special effects. Those youngsters who will find themselves watching this film will be cast under its spell due to this much like I and hopefully you were at their age to.For the child and explorer in all of us there is no better tale to partake in than The Goonies, a film that has charm to spare and rewards for re-watch after re-watch. Much like the titular gang who never say die hopefully the film will live on and on and continue to put a smile on the faces of all who take the wonderful journey.5 truffle shuffles out of 5",The Goonies

In order to try to save their homes from real estate interests, the Goonies decided to find a treasure of a pirate using a map they have found. Directed by Richard Donner, this film has a script by Chris Columbos based on a story by Steven Spielberg, and the cast is entirely made up of young stars still little known to the public at the time.An excellent comedy mixed with Italian gangsters and pepperoni pizza, this film was seen for many young people in the following years, and allowed to them to feel the magic of the treasure hunts, pirates and adventures (in that time, the pirate movies was an out of fashion genre). Perhaps this is the reason why this film became a cult classic and has been seen and appreciated for generations to date. And its well deserved, since there are no negative notes in this film. Its a guarantee of laughter and family entertainment.",The Goonies

I think i saw them on screen when i was 11 during Christmas 85. Then i didn't get it was the new production of the team behind the great Gremlins of the last year but it was again a wonderful time: Chunk was really funny, Mikey got inspiration and Andy was just jaw-breaking (i couldn't speak without blushing!) ! Now i see that this team features LOTR Sam, Indy and Stand by me buddies so the cream of 80s kids: Brolin and Logia are forever cool here... For me, this movie is just awesome because it offers the best afternoon of fun, thrills, adventures we can imagine: it's like a role-playing session with friends (except mine had no girls) and it's much better than animated movies! Those kids lived in a beautiful location, had great values for each other, their parents and this pirate trail is much intriguing than those of Caribean! This movie is so great that today nobody can do the same! The DVD is really stuffed with nice outtakes, commentaries and a short making-of!

48,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"""Goonies"" is a kids classic with a Spielberg-sized imagination and heart",8,16 August 2008,"As much as ""The Goonies"" is distinctly an 80s film, there's no denying that sense of timelessness about it as a kids adventure film. It's got buried treasure, creepy yet conveniently klutzy bad guys, and that archetypal rag-tag group of kids who all go by nicknames. That's pretty much the foundation for live action kids movies for at least the next decade. Unfortunately, that kind of kids' entertainment has fallen by the wayside to make way for CGI in this century, but that shouldn't cheat ""The Goonies"" of its sense of magic, mystery and the courage of children who refuse to let rationality plague their thinking while they're still young.""The Goonies"" follows a group of kids on the Oregon coast, all with their own amusing quirks, as they search for a treasure that would give them enough money to save their homes from being bought out by the wealthy folks in town. There's Mikey (Sean Astin), the fearless leader, Mouth (Corey Feldman), the smart-ass, Data (Jonathan Ke Quan) the crazy gadget nerd and Chunk (Jeff Cohen) the rotund, hunger-driven, paranoid, klutz. When the boys escape, they're followed by Mikey's older brother Brand (Josh Brolin) and his love interest, Andy--the teenage friendly subplot. Of course the treasure is buried beneath the house of some insanely creepy murderers named the Fratellis who are completely stupid yet no less creepy. Joe Pantoliano plays one of them. They're your standard villains and perfect for the fantasy element of the movie. Obviously this film tries to play off producer/writer Steven Spielberg's success with Indiana Jones by setting up underground cave booby traps as the kids go after the treasure. This is a very funny movie in both the cute family way and clever way too. The humor that comes from these kids is fun for children viewers because it's visual and funny for adults because of what comes out of their mouths. While this is mostly a boys-oriented film, it's definitely intended for families, although I was surprised by the swearing of some of the kids in the film.Considering Spielberg, Richard Donner (one of the 80s most famous directors) and future Harry Potter director Chris Columbus all played a part in the creation of this film, it should be no surprise this film has the imagination and the talent behind it to work on all these levels for all these different audiences. While I do think the movie kind of fizzles in the last half hour with all the focus on the treasure and escaping, the rest is so strong that you can get through it easily. This is simply a kids/family classic.",The Goonies

50,Anonymous_Maxine,Steven Spielberg exercises the farthest reached of his imagination in this unforgettable tale of childhood adventures.,10,3 September 2000,"Every kid has imagined what it would be like to go on great and glorious adventures. Pirate ships, police chases, treasure chests full of gold and surrounded by human skeletons with patches over the eyes, the inherent excitement in the possibility of a cavernous wonder world beneath the very streets where they live. The Goonies is about a group of kids who have grown up together and are about to be torn apart because their parents are being forced to sell their homes. In the attic of one of their houses (Mikey, played by Sean Astin), they find an endless supply of fascinating things - treasure maps, paintings, cryptic writings in strange languages. They find a map that sounds promising, and decide to see if it has any value, hoping to be able to find enough treasure to prevent their parents from losing their homes. Not only was The Goonies a brilliantly written, directed, and acted movie, but it was also so much FUN! The adventures of these kids through the underground world, while being chased by the despicable villains known as the Fratellis, are fascinating to watch. The Goonies is a great cinematic experience. It has everything that anyone who was ever a kid could ever want. Even the elaborate sets are very convincing. The sense of adventure and hope that are presented in The Goonies is very uplifting and inspiring. The lovable characters are perfectly developed and endlessly entertaining. Many of them, particularly Sean Astin and Corey Feldman, delivered the best performances of their future careers right here in this early adventure film. This movie can be enjoyed by virtually anyone, which is one of its best values. It is truly timeless, and it should not be missed.",The Goonies
51,Vartiainen,Made custom order for the 80s,5,15 January 2020,"It's funny how some things can click with you, while others don't. Personally, I love the darker 80s movies. The Terminator, Highlander, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, et cetera. But for some reason I can't stand the comedies of that decade at all.The Goonies being a fine example. I mean, I get why it's popular. It has that Spielbergian charm to it. Small town Americana, young geeks finding their voice, affable villains who you love to hate. A lost treasure to be found, quirky characters, a good message.Yet I don't like it. I think all of the kids are either weeps or seriously creepy. Corey Feldman's Clark ""Mouth"" Devereaux is definitely the worst of the latter category. The way this preteen hits on women thrice his age is just messed up. It's supposed to come across as quirky and funny, but it's not. It's creepy. Jonathan Ke Huy Quan as Richard ""Data"" Wang is also weird in how he doesn't fit in. Here's a little kid that would put Inspector Gadget to shame, yet he's in this movie that has more in common with a tame Stephen King novel. His ""inventions"" steal most of the scenes they feature in, but not in a good way.That being said, all the characters are identifiable. I also like how the villains are really rather incompetent and kind of morons. Makes them funnier to watch and gives them personality.I can see why people like the film.

53,hellraiser7,Tomb Raiders,10,23 February 2012,"Yeah, I was a kid in the 80's decade and this was one of the first films I've seen since I was about 8, I loved it then and I still love it now. This film is one of my personal favorite films in general.Everything about this film is just perfect (in my book)because it succeeded where most family/kid films fail to do for me which is entertain me, the film kinda manifests that dream we sometimes have of escaping from our usual existence or boredom for a while and going on some wild and fun adventure. It's one of those family/kid movies done the right way where it's not watered down, insult our intelligence, or even pulling off gimmicks just for the sake of it.I really love the set pieces their all practical and built, from the caverns and pirate ship you can really see the effort they put into it. I love the traps which were inspired by the Rube Goalburg cartoons, just seeing how they work is a joy and looks plausible if not entirely probable (some principles work). The music is great that theme song from Cindi Lapper is one of my favorite movie themes. It has good action and suspense that is in constant motion you almost can't take a breath, my favorite is of course the infamous music challenge where the characters have to play a skeleton piano (which looks like something out of heavy metal cover art), that part kept me on the edge of my seat constantly thinking don't you dare hit that wrong note. But the humor is great there are physical gags and verbal humor that beautifully go together, the things you see and hear can be just hilarious, like seeing Brent ride a tricycle sort of the equivalent of the clown bike.But what really makes this film of course are all the characters themselves. There are a lot of protagonists and usually this isn't always a good idea but this film managed to make it work because they all have unique distinctive developed personas where you know them enough but also have a factor of relatibility, I even like that these kids (as well as three teens with them) aren't stereotypical or look like pretty boys/girls(which is a look I can't stand) but looks and feel like regular people. What makes them standout more along with the film is the sense of relatablity, making these protagonists feel more accessible. I even like the location that this film takes place since my aunt, uncle, and cousin live in Oregon state, as well as the neighborhood they live in, looks likes the type I lived in. And all these characters are geeks (I mean that in a good way) and underdogs which I like those kinds of characters because that what I and my friends are, weren't really the kind of kids that were popular but had a lot to offer. I even like their motive for their adventure and it's not for greed or glory which I always believe are the wrong reasons for adventure but simply to save their neighborhood by being demolished by some greedy butt head land developers.As for my favorite character, I'd have to say it's Mouth (played brilliantly by Corey Felman) whom is true to his name. His character is practically the interpreter of the adventure. I just simply love his charisma, he's just funny a real wisecracker, just has some of the best lines in the movie and delivers them well like ""Jerk Alert!"".The others are great Data whom has as many gadgets as ""Batman"". Chunk whom despite a big kid, isn't stereotypical he also has some great charisma and lines, he might seem a bit clumsy but by it's nature it's actually dumb luck which really works to his advantage.Brent and Mikey like the back and forth between them how the brotherly relationship is portrayed, kinda similar with the character Pete and Pete in the TV show ""The Adv of Pete and Pete"". Mikey being the younger one is the most adventious and daring, he's smart but naive. Brent is more grounded, I like the fact even though he's a man of muscle he's not a jock he's an underdog doesn't have a car and probably not much luck with ladies, he gets the most grief from his brother but he goes along (probably also out of boredom) since he has to watch over him even if Mikey is leading him to the road to Hell.Well that's all I have to say, ""The Goonies"" is a treasure.Rating: 4 stars",The Goonies

The story doesn't make much sense, the script is long on puerile 'comedy', the characters are either unlikable or uninteresting stereotypes, and the ending mawkishly sentimental (typical of a Spielberg 'kids' film).

I don't know.It's one of those movies that I think is enhanced significantly in the memory of childhood. I doubt anyone who sees it for the first time as an adult would rate it higher than a 6 or 7.The movie is something to do with kids whose house is going to be taken from them by some rich guys who want to build a country club. They find a pirate map in the attic and follow it through some caves to find the treasure. On the way they meet a gang of bad guys led by the inimitable character actress, Anne Ramsey, and other great character actors Joe Pantoliano and Robert Davi. I guess they're just in the movie because it needs a bad guy.The kids in the movie - apparently calling themselves ""Goonies"" because they live in the ""goon docks"" area of Oregon - are the usual assortment of colourful characters whose personalities - and usefulness to the plot - can be summed up in one word, and indeed, they are - ""Mouth"" is the lippy kid, ""Data"" is the genius whose clothes conceal inventions, ""Chunk"" is the fat kid. And of course, there's the Average Joe protagonist, because all kids see themselves as average and need someone to identify with.Most of the movie takes place in caves where the Goonies follow a treasure map. This is a tedious location for a kids' movie, and the movie really seems to stall when they get there.In fact, most of the locations in the movie are boring. At least there's a pirate ship at the end. But for most of the run time, I was just waiting for it to end.",The Goonies

It's the ultimate '80s kid adventure, as a crew of young pals seek lost pirate treasure beneath their sleepy coastal Oregon suburb. When compared to the stiffer, more highly-orchestrated kids' movies of today, The Goonies is refreshingly grounded. The stakes may be relatively small, but they feel insurmountable from a pre-teen's perspective, and that's what really counts. Led by a sharp-tongued Corey Feldman, the young actors do a great job of conveying that blend of quick wit and fading innocence. They might occasionally trip over words and step on lines, but that makes the production feel more alive, more real. Because, let's be honest, in a room full of actual grade-schoolers, there aren't a whole lot of quiet moments.The opening act, in particular, is a masterpiece of off-the-cuff jokes and effective scene-setting, as we get to know the gang and prepare the stage for their bicycle-powered expedition. Later chapters can get a bit cute, and pacing is sometimes a problem, but those shortcomings are generally smoothed out by the film's convincing practical effects, sweet character and overwhelming sense of childhood discovery. A veritable time capsule of the personalities, and production styles, of the period. And now I've got Cyndi Lauper running through my head again.",The Goonies
61,GiraffeDoor,I sort of want to like it but it has aged horribly.,4,4 April 2019,"As Iconic as this movie is, what i didn't expect was just how weird the pacing is.They are in a big rush to get this story started, such a big one they lay very little groundwork on who the characters are and what the real problem is. I think they're going to lose their home for some reason but I didn't really get a moment to really appreciate what was on stake impressed upon me.Then when they discover a treasure map and they've barely read it before they're out the door like it's nothing. But even after all this rush, it takes a long time for anything interesting to happen. They try and fill the already over stretched running time with sitcom style jokes like how the fat kid likes food or how one kid misleads the monoglot hispanic woman.We get very little impression much interesting is going to happen in what seems, for its first half, to just be some kids, a map and some bank robbers. It picks up eventually with some beautiful sets but boy, does this picture take its sweet time with everything.And everything in this movie is...sloppy. The way the dialogue is formed and how the scenes are visualized...I don't have the vocabulary an actual film scholar would have but I got the impression the the writers and the director were all a bit whatever about the whole thing.I like the child actors, they bring a lot of energy and charisma but they have no idea what enunciation is. I'm not one of these people that needs everything to be in RP to understand english, I speak in RP myself but I struggled to follow them.It's got heart, and I won't say it doesn't have its moments (though half as many as it seems to think it does) but there is a tragic sensation of a real classic that just didn't get the handling it deserved.It's aged quite horribly. If you haven't seen it, even by '80s movies standards it doesn't really hold up, your kids most certainly will not have the patience for it, I know I didn't and I saw it today, in my 20s.At least there is a cute girl and an even cuter one.

The kids are all very good here, giving energetic performances and carving out unique and memorable characters in the process. The adults also fare well, with the Fratelli clan (Robert Davi, Joe Pantoliano and Anne Ramsey) making for a fun and eclectic group of villains. It also looks great, from the cinematography to impressive sets like One Eyed Willy's pirate ship.

63,snoozejonc,Epic adventure with memorable performances from child actors,8,2 November 2020,"A group of children go on an adventure to find a pirate's treasure.This is an excellent example of 80s comedy and what works for me is the concept that a group of children can do exciting, 'Indiana Jones' type stuff in their own neighbourhood. This was something I could relate to as a child always seeking to escape the normal town environment and go on adventures into the nearby woods and hills.The plot is reasonably good but is really just a device to kickstart the adventure and provides a reason why it happens.What makes the film great are the Goonies themselves. This movie stars a collection of excited and energetic children. Richard Donner captures distinct characters and some wonderful interaction between them all. That is no mean feet when you have up to seven of them sharing a screen and continuously firing off humorous one-liners. The standout performance is Jeff Cohen who is effortlessly charismatic and funny as Lawrence ""Chunk"". This type of group is a cliched product of its time, with a leader, a joker, an overweight target, and an ethnic stereotype, but it's about the highest quality example of it you can find.The production values are excellent and stand the test of time, which you would expect from a Spielberg/Donner/Industrial Light and Magic collaboration. The underground sequences are wonderfully atmospheric and the pirate ship is a masterpiece of set design.I was an 80s child and remember The Goonies being almost a cultural movement on the schoolyard due to its popularity.

65,MissSimonetta,One of the best films from my childhood,9,23 August 2013,"This is one of those few movies from my childhood that still brings a smile to my face. It's an essential adventure flick, filled to the brim with comedy and thrills. No matter how many times you go back to revisit it, the entertainment value is never exhausted.One of my favorite aspects of this film is how real the kids seem. They curse and try to act more adult than they actually are, just as most preteens are wont to do.Anyways, this is an awesome movie. Even though it's dated in some ways (but then again, every movie that ever has been and will be made is going to be dated, even our fancy CG-saturated blockbusters), it holds up very well.

Seeing this movie for the first time at the age of 8, I was one of millions of kids who were blown away by this Family action / comedy.A modern day fantasy that is still as good when it came out almost 20 years ago, the story of beating the odds, good verse evil, finding hope in the most unlikely of places, the under dogs winning the day, and the age old take of discovery is what Goonies is all about.

Unfortunately, ""kiddie"" films like this aren't made with this kind of passion anymore.Granted, Spy Kids may have reestablished this medium, but that film didn't have the dialogue and wit The Goonies possessed.

72,Jonny_Numb,The Cyndi Lauper Nostalgia Machine still rocks...,7,18 September 2006,"Before tonight, it had been roughly 7 years since my last viewing of ""The Goonies"" (from an era where I bore the nickname 'Sloth' among a select few)...and at first, I didn't really know what to think. The hyperactive exclamations of prepubescent Sean Astin ('Mikey'), Corey Feldman ('Mouth'), Jeff Cohen ('Chunk'), and Ke Huy Quan ('Data')--the 'Goonies' of the title--kind of grated on my nerves with their novice, kitchen-sink performances (even considering the usual excesses of child actors, this was pushing it). But just as I was beginning to think that, the movie kicked into gear and began its enthralling course--yes, even at 25 years of age, I can say without a hint of shame that I had a lot of fun with this kid-friendly ""Temple of Doom."" Our titular characters live in an overcast seaside community, set to be razed by greedy land developers looking to put up a golf course. While messing around with the antiques in Mikey's attic, our boys stumble across a 17th-century treasure map, and decide to embark on a quest to find the (implied) riches contained within. In their travels, they also run afoul of the slapstick quartet of 'Ma' Frattelli (Ann Ramsey) and her three sons (Robert Davi and ""Memento""'s Joe Pantoliano), one of whom is a hideously deformed--but very humane--Charles Addams caricature. The Goonies also run into booby traps aplenty, and the story maintains a surprising amount of unpredictability, considering its target audience (while *mostly* a kid's movie, the material isn't inaccessible to older viewers).That being said, Steven Spielberg's story credit seems a bit dubious, especially when looking at ""The Goonies"" from a distance: he could have very well approached Warners with ""'Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom,' only with kids instead of Harrison Ford!"" and collected his check on the way out. Whereas Indy, Willie, and Short Round altruistically braved peril to save the children of an impoverished Indian village, we have the Goonies altruistically banding together to save their threatened community.Of course, this would be bothersome...if ""The Goonies"" wasn't so much damn fun. Like the endearing classic ""Ghostbusters,"" ""The Goonies"" is a similar 1980s gem, with a sense of creativity, adventure, and humor (including some fine one-liners), with plenty of crossover appeal to individuals who claim to have 'outgrown' this sort of film. If the film is dated in any way, it's only in the Cyndi Lauper theme song (which is still a bitchin' tune) that gives ""The Goonies"" its adventurously fun, young-at-heart identity.",The Goonies
73,adamjohns-42575,"""Shame, Shame, I Know Your Name!""",9,3 April 2021,"I didn't realise how highly I rated this film until I tried to compare it to the other 700 films that I have reviewed and rated over the past couple of years. It's just got a lot to it. There's a cause to fight for, humour in buckets, adventure, terror, crime and romance all encapsulated in a great little story and with performances from some of the best child actors of the eighties.As a child of the eighties myself, it will always have a little nostalgic place in my heart that will remind me to revisit it and often. One of those films that you should definitely share with your own children, grandchildren, nieces and nephews and anyone else who hasn't seen it basically. It sounds like a cliche, but they really don't make them like this anymore. Mostly because they wouldn't get away with it.It is a fantastically funny film with slapstick that doesn't hit you too hard, as well as jokes of a more subtle nature, with something that everyone can enjoy. I love the cartoon sound effects that they used.I can't help but wonder how much of this film was improvised or just what the cameras caught while they were still rolling, as it looks like the cast has a fantastic time making it and there are some bits that are just too brilliant to have been scripted.One of the only issues I have with the film, which I have carried with me since I first saw it, is Sloth. That guy still scares the bejesus out of me even now. I mean, why did they have to make his ears wiggle like that??? To be honest the entire Fratelli family are pretty scary. You certainly wouldn't want to meet them in a dark alley.The only other flaw that I can find, which is true of many films of a similar kind, is that they all shout and talk over each other and it makes it impossible to hear what's going on.Apart from that, this film will always be a classic and should be a marker that all children's adventure flicks should be held up against.",The Goonies
74,vertigo_14,Goonies are Good Enough! (spoilers),8,17 August 2004,"The Goonies is yet another 80s teen/youth targeted movie that will transcend its time for years to come. In fact, I had just gone to a free screening of The Goonies in the park and the audience was primarily people in their early and mid 20s. So it looks like the people who loved this movie as a kid will cherish even as they get older. I'm one of them. As one of the greatest adventure film, The Goonies were a group of kids out of the Oregon boonies (aka The Goondocks). The Walshes who's son, Mikey (Sean Astin), is the unofficial Goonies leader, knows that his folks need plenty of cash fast to cover the back taxes and save the Goondocks from the like of that sniveling Troy Perkins's father.Hanging around the house one afternoon and driven by the curiosity of what Mikey's father might do with all that cool junk in the attic, the boys come upon a great discovery: a map of One-Eyed Willy's (yes, there are obvious synonyms to be made from the name) ""rich stuff."" So The Goonies are on one last adventure!Only, the map leads them to a bunch of fugitive gangsters called The Fratelli's (a terrific cast of villains featuring Anne Ramsey as Mama Fratelli; Joe Pantoliano as Francis; Robert Davi as Jake; and the late John Matuszak as the large, deformed and loveable Sloth Fratelli). When one of the Goonies get's captured by the Fratelli's, it doesn't take them long to figure out that these kids are sniffing a trail of treasure, and the Fratelli's want to get to it first, no matter what.Aside from a great story and a great soundtrack (featuring 80s queen, Cindi Lauper in the soundtrack and music video for the song, 'Good Enough'), you have a priceless cast and film crew. Sean Astin, Josh Brolin, Martha Plimpton, and Corey Feldman (to some extent) have surpassed their transition into adult roles, so they've been around quite a while. Nostalgic viewers should get a kick out of seeing them a squeaky voice little kids--except for the gorgeous Josh Brolin, who was already 17 at the time of the film's release. None of the kids are annoying as those cast in family films often tend to be (and with the exception of some of Sean Astin's dialogue, it is hardly corny). You have a good assortment of characters like fast-talking Mouth (Corey Feldman), braniac inventor (Data), and the hyperactive fat kid (who may be the most well known character in the film and turned Jeff Cohen into a cult star, despite his not doing much in movies afterwards).
And of course, it is especially helped by filmmakers who always work well with family film material and young casts and scripts (like Speilberg with E.T.; and Chris Columbus with Home Alone and the Harry Potter movies), especially when it comes to the adventure genre. This movie really has a lot going for it and gives a lot of laughs from beginning to end.
Kids will surely enjoy this great modern pirate adventure! If you're a kid, it probably encourages you to seek out some Goonie adventure yourself, afterwards.",The Goonies
75,Sandcooler,"Dashes of Spielberg magic, but the characters sorta annoy me",5,22 April 2012,"As a kid I've never bothered to watch ""The Goonies"", which according to most definitions of the term means I haven't had a childhood. Today I've finally made up for lost time, but unfortunately I was a tad disappointed. The story about a bunch of kids trying to trace a pirate's treasure has all the potential in the world, but all this old trilobite got out of this movie was a migraine. There's so much high-pitched screaming going on in this movie I've turned on my alarm clock just to relax a little. And generally I have nothing against stereotypes, but come on: 80% of the fat kid's lines is about food, the Asian kid invents gadgets, it's just sorta painful here. Why these characters get so much attention while the at the time still cool Corey Feldman barely gets to do anything is beyond me. The movie's obviously well-made and it definitely has some bright spots (Sloth!), but you just miss the heart-warming friendship between boys you saw in things like ""Stand By Me"" or ""The Lost Boys"".

I remember really enjoying it when I was 9 walking out of the theater. One of the definitive 80s movies, The Goonies, a mid-80s movie pretty much defines the decade and adventure genre. Not really an important movie or particularly well done, it features some fun scenes and memorable chumming awash in perfectly 80s music. The cast of child actors seemed to mesh very well, obviously enjoying their moments together. The adventure is well paced, if standard, and the sets are fairly well done for the most part. Yes, The Goonies is one of those movies, you may stop to watch if you see it again for nostalgia's sake if you're one of those 80s kids. Recommended for 80's fans especially.",The Goonies

The title and initial intro was slightly off-putting but it's one of those movies that you have to watch the whole thing of to really appreciate it. Sure, it's a little weird at times, there's a few crude jokes (the statue, oh my god), but at a closer look you'll see that it's a story about friendship and childhood adventures, something you never get too old to remember.The Goonies is one of those films that either you love, or you hate. I love it and I hope it isn't lost among the sea of bad remakes of other movie classics popping up in the 21st century. I hope other generations get to experience this film (though at that point it may be outdated since kids today are lazy as heck and slaves to Apple Inc.).

78,punishmentpark,"""Hey - you - gu-uys!""",6,3 May 2015,"'The Goonies' is more than anything else a hysterical movie; almost every character seems to be screaming most of the time. And quite a few characters are pretty annoying even beyond that, like Chunk (didn't he look like Bette Midler's grandson?) and his obsession with food, Mikey (Sean Astin? Really? I hadn't recognized him) and his ability to be utterly corny to the point one would call a doctor, or Mouth, who is just plain annoying. The plot itself is like Indiana Jones for kids, without the traveling, plus a dysfunctional Italian crime family.Nearing the end, things got better, with the dazzling water slide and that terrific underground set with the pirate ship (though that town and its surroundings were great to look at as well). One character who was over the top also, but still has my sympathy, is Sloth. Mother Fratelli, by Anne Ramsey, was quite 'lovable', too. All in all, a kid's film that is just about doable if you can take all hysteria, though I'd expected to feel more sentimental than I do.6 out of 10.",The Goonies
79,oneguyrambling,It takes a lot of work to look this effortless... and fun.,8,8 June 2011,"I guess if Evil Dead gets 37 different DVD releases and practically every film released in the last decade has three or four versions on sale, it's only fair that The Goonies gets a special 25th anniversary edition DVD release. After all this teen Indiana Jones featuring the pre-pubescent Breakfast Club holds a similar place for as many 30 somethings as Stand By Me does, and like Stand By Me this film holds up remarkably well.If you were going to make a movie that appeals to teenage boys what do you think you might put in it?Bikes, inventions, skeletons, nutshots, potty humour.Adventure, near misses and close escapes? Booby traps, codes and challenges.Criminals? Monsters??TREASURE MAPS & PIRATES???How about all of the above? The Goonies are four pre-teen buddies with clever nicknames that also serve to explain more about them than 15 minutes of exposition would:Mouth – The loud talkative one.Data – The nerdy inventor one.Chunk – The fat obnoxious and clumsy one.Mike – The ummm one named Mike? He is asthmatic if that helps.The first prison escape and ensuing car chase neatly intros every principal character that will appear in the film within an entertaining 5 minutes. Clever stuff really.After a couple more rambunctious pre-teen conversations – and a plot device that finds them with the desperate need to find big cash quick or their house will be foreclosed to make way for a golf course – the boys unexpectedly come across what appears to be a pirate's treasure map from 1632, made by the renowned local pirate One Eyed Willie (aren't they all?).So the four Goonies, along with Mike's older brother Brandon (Josh Brolin Yep No Country for Old Men himself) and his cheerleader target of (PG13) conquest Andie and her buddy Steph unwittingly along for the ride; off everyone goes for an adventure.To ramp up the action a notch further the local crime family the Fratellis are injected into proceedings so that they might pose a threat by staying one step behind the kids at all times. Don't worry kids, the Fratellis are an old Mum and her two boneheaded sons, no-one gets hurt and there is never any serious peril or danger.With all the major players identified and in play the hunt leads all and sundry into a vast underground series of caves and tunnels, with booby traps and dangerous terrain all around, the traps were lain by the late Mr Willie who it was alleged would rather die wealthy than spread his booty around unlike Jessica Simpson – who will only die wealthyEach Goonie gets their respective chance to shine as they come across each new obstacle or elaborate puzzle, the girls are their to provide love and lust interests and to shriek when the situation demands – and if all that isn't enough a fourth ""forgotten"" Fratelli, the hideously disfigured ogre-ish Sloth pops his magnificently unique lump head into the fray Again don't worry he's not a bad hideously disfigured, massively muscled ogre, he's a good guy (great 80s makeup job though!).Everyone learns something from the experience, there is some immensely entertaining action sequences and the whole thing is as light and realistic as a Miss Universe contestant, thankfully it makes more sense though.What sets Goonies apart is the little touches, despite the large number of characters in the group everyone is distinctly different, but aside from just the broad strokes mentioned above there are little touches that lend further human qualities to the boys that go beyond mere caricature – the asthma inhaler, the inventions, the clumsiness and strange stories – they all help.The plot is necessarily preposterous at all times, everything is skewed towards fun and escapism, and as mentioned previously this has been purpose built to entertain, amuse and inspire young boys – just like Britney Spears. That's three pop-culture potshots at obvious targets in one review – my parents must be so proud!Final Rating – 7.5 / 10. As with many things The Goonies all appears effortless and straightforward, but as we should know it takes a lot of effort and planning to make things look this easy, even then this has the added bonus of being consistently fun and engaging. There's a reason this has an audience 25 years on when Due Date will be forgotten in 25 days.",The Goonies

It's a rarity in that, although it's a kids film through and through, it goes down just as well (if not better) with adults.As someone who was born after 'The Goonies' was released, I don't have the same fond memories of this film as others who grew up with it do. For me, it's an imaginative and enjoyable family adventure, but not the 'classic' that it is to others. 'The Goonies' has some great individual moments and scenes but as a whole, I think there are better kids adventure films out there.",The Goonies
81,mentalcritic,The Goonies ARE good enough,10,29 June 2005,"It was in 2001 or thereabouts that I watched and listened to the audio commentary track that is on the DVD version of The Goonies. Nostalgia is a wonderful thing, and seeing how the principal cast had aged (or hardly aged in Josh Brolin's case) was worth the price of admission on its own. But this is just one of The Goonies' selling points. Despite what the IMDb's ratings would have you believe, it is an immortal classic that warrants repeated and frequent viewings. It is not a coincidence that many of its cast and crew have repeatedly appeared in all sorts of productions before and since. Indeed, this was probably the first film that introduced me to the reality that the same actor will often play ten different parts in ten different films when I realised that Jonathan Ke Quan was the same brat that made parts of Indiana Jones And The Temple Of Doom so amusing. Seeing him in the video-enhanced commentary of the DVD nearly two decades later was a surprise and a half.The film revolves around a group of children and adolescents who live in the poorer, less trendy part of a beachfront town. Unlike an episode of Barney, every member of this principal group is given a background and a string of differences from their castmates. You will not see the teenaged Brand responding to the same situation in the same manner as the ten year old Mikey, and that is where a major part of the film's strength is derived. The only weakness in the characterisations is with Martha Plimpton and Kerri Green, who join the adventuring boys a little way into the film. Exactly what they are doing other than giving the character of Brand something similar to himself to bounce his more adult-oriented lines from is anyone's guess, but they do work in their limited capacity. It is just a pity that Chris Columbus' screenplay did not give them a little more to do, other than defuse one fiendish trap towards the end of the ride.Speaking of fiendish traps, the adventurers journey from one puzzling location to the next with barely a stop for breath. It works because unlike similar adventure films where the director expects us to be impressed by a fiendish-sounding name, the specific places that are visited by the Goonies have function. The bone piano shown in one such sequence, for example, would appear in the nightmares of children learning a regular piano for years after the film's theatrical release. It also gives Corey Feldman a good chance to act out a character who speaks very fluent Spanish. And while I am on that subject, who could forget the immortal scene early on in the film where Mouth deliberately loses something in the translation when Rosalita is shown around? But the prize for scene-stealing goes to John Matuszak, who plays the unofficial eighth Goonie, Sloth, with a weird aplomb that may well scare the willies out of parts of the intended audience. But then, in 1985, scaring the intended audience a little was considered a healthy part of making a film for those in the age ranges depicted here.They say you cannot have a good protagonist without a good antagonist to bounce off. Robert Davi, Joe Pantoliano, and Anne Ramsey provide antagonists so good that they utterly hose the rule about not working with animals or children. The Fratellis work so well here because they are working with children. The late Anne Ramsey played her part so well that the mere thought of watching her in anything scared the willies out of me for years. Nowadays, as I have fully realised the mechanics behind film for some years, I am keen as mustard to see some of her other work in such pieces as Throw Momma From The Train (now there's a title that brings images to mind) or Meet the Hollowheads. That a performance can produce two entirely different reactions in the same person at different stages of their life should tell you all you need to know about its quality. Robert Davi and Joe Pantoliano are somewhat overshadowed here, but the manic, cackling quality of their introductory act also left quite a lasting impression.You might have noticed that I have so far only mentioned the special effects in passing while heaping praise upon the acting. This is because unlike films such as the recent Star Wars prequels, the effects complement the acting rather than overshadow it. From what I am able to tell, all of the effects in The Goonies are practical, and some of them quite inventive. There is no use of blood squibs, which may disappoint some viewers, but there are enough mechanical sets and air vents to fill three films. Some of these effects did not turn out so well and were cut from the final film (the squid sequence being the most famous example), but unlike a lot of films that depend on special effects for a crucial element, everything shown in the final cut is in perfect sync here. Suspension of disbelief is never an issue, which is just as well considering some of the preposterous things that roll by the screen with a certain nonchalance.I gave The Goonies a ten out of ten. Like Superman or the original Lethal Weapon, it shows that Richard Donner knows how to make a classic. Now that it is twenty years old, it stands forever as a relic of a time when the world of those under the age of eighteen was far less oppressive. If you have not introduced your children around the age of ten or greater to its joys and moments, then shame on you.",The Goonies
82,hall895,Misadventure,4,15 August 2015,"The Goonies is a childhood adventure best left to children. Kids might find the movie enjoyable. Maybe. But viewed through the eyes of an adult the movie is a flop. The script is dire, the acting is rather terrible, a number of the characters serve no purpose while other characters serve only to annoy. And the supposed great adventure our young heroes go on is not even particularly interesting. There is very little excitement to be had here, honestly this is a rather boring movie.The story follows a group of kids as they search for long-lost pirate treasure. A very simple plot but that would be OK if this treasure hunt was exciting. It is not. The kids find many obstacles in their way. There are booby traps to get through and some hapless villains on their tail. It all becomes repetitive rather quickly. Make your way through this trap, then that trap, then another trap. All along the way spout terrible dialogue and in many instances have many kids spouting that terrible dialogue all at the same time. These kids talk, and scream, over one another for two hours. Get me an aspirin. The acting is completely unconvincing. Child actors are capable of great performances. Not in this movie. We get grating performances from the whole lot of them. Sean Astin, playing the leader of the group, is probably most annoying of all though Ke Huy Quan, who you may remember as the incredibly annoying kid from Temple of Doom, runs him close. There are a couple of girls tossed into the proceedings and they add absolutely nothing. Meanwhile the villains are total duds. There is very little good to say here.

The kids are out future. Whatever expression you choose, it can be applied to this good natured romp that sees modern day stars in their opening roles.Sean Astin, who leads the way splendidly, would soon be hailed to fail in the Lord of the Rings trilogy whilst Josh Brolin would take up award winning roles in No Country for Old Men.But of course this was the time before such accolades and so we settle for more subdued but more fun style acting in a charming adventure that has the energy and mystery of an Indiana Jones adventure, if not the sophisticated mythology and independence.The opening scenes see a charming if highly unrealistic prison breakout that starts our adventure off in thrilling fashion. Followed sweetly by the sharp and memorable introduction of The Goonies and you'll be forgiven for smiling from ear to ear. Jonathan Ke Quan's introduction is one to not be spoiled, but watch out for never has a young actor made such an exciting appearance.As we have a political message thrown in and some sloppy information encoded for historical emphasis, we are finally under way with the group setting off on an adventure to recover the treasure of One Eyed Willie. The idea sounds absurd, and in many degrees it is. In context the whole idea of getting treasure to save their house seems far-fetched and a last ditch attempt but thankfully we can almost ignore the obscurity of this goal and simply sit back and enjoy the thrills and comedy spills along the way.There are some marvellous set pieces juxtaposed with stunning semiotics of piracy. The boat itself is a symbol of true fantasy gold and the sweeping set montages do justice to the story's potential. The action and adventure side, whilst Indiana Jones obstacles, is nonetheless fun and exciting and true gold for the younger viewers.When combining two such different genres in comedy and adventure it is easy to give one away to the other but somehow writer Spielberg and director Donner maintain both in equal balance, which is a stunning achievement given the complexity of different personalities of The Goonies and the massive adventure on hands, which makes this a wonder in itself.Where The Goonies falls is it's lack of realism in context. There are too many close calls and just in time moments and there seems to be lacking any real consequence, maybe because the characters are kids to give the viewers a more relaxed viewing.But this 1985 release is visually stunning, balancing the genres on equal length and when the laughs come, they really do.

I feel there is a lot of nostalgia tied to a movie that hits a generation of individuals at just the right time for them to be memorable to these people. Sometimes, these cult classics are movies that I didn't get around to seeing-especially when they were relevant to my friends. For whatever reason, The Goonies (1985) has eluded me for 35 years. I can certainly see its appeal, but I mostly just watched it and wondered why people thought it was so great.I will say that this film is a trip down memory lane in the sense that I don't think I've ever seen a movie with either Sean Astin or Josh Brolin as young as they were in this one. The fact that many meme-able moments from this film have lasted in the popular culture zeitgeist for so long is a testament to its powerful nostalgia. Having never seen The Goonies until now, I already knew it was about pirate treasure and the adventure a rag-tag group of kids embarks on to recover it.All this being said, The Goonies is weird. I felt like its first act dragged along, and it didn't get interesting until about half-way through (when it entered its Indiana Jones phase). Plus, there were almost too many subplots that seemed to be included to pad the run-time on an already light plot. Sure, each of the kids had their own adventure along the way, but did it need to include ""Sloth"" (John Matuszak)? If anything, I found The Goonies to be a bit insensitive to the disabled, as well as to Asians-with the Asian stereotype being played for laughs more often than not.A cult classic that I couldn't get into, I give The Goonies 3.0 stars out of 5.",The Goonies

87,gab-14712,A Fast-Paced Adventure For All Ages!,8,12 June 2020,"As a child, I loved The Goonies. The movie seemed to be a rite of passage for every kid growing up in the 80's, 90's, and even today. The movie appealed to me because it has treasure hunts! I mean, what kid does not want to go on a treasure hunt? As an adult, I was ready to dive back into the world of nostalgia. The end result? In terms of Spielberg-produced adventures, I did like Gremlins more. That does not mean I disliked this particular movie or anything. It is a fun, highly-energized adventure film with all of those Spielbergian trademarks we all come to know and love. I think I outgrew the main characters. They had wonderful chemistry and acted like normal children, but perhaps I was a little annoyed with them.Steven Spielberg did not direct the movie, only merely produced it. He oversaw the production, however. Spielberg was one of those innovators who introduced ""horror films for children"", the trend that grew massive starting in the 1980's. He took horrifying concepts and made them kid-friendly, and more fun. These films, while still a little scary, allowed children and adults alike to enjoy the film. Like Gremlins and Ghostbusters, The Goonies is one of those films. This film also was influenced by the first two Indiana Jones films. You see the falling boulders and the sharp spikes. As for the children themselves, I did see ET influences. For the most part, I think the influences were incorporated rather well into the film.The film was helmed by Richard Donner, who previously directed one of my favorite superhero films, Superman. This shoot was a new challenge for Donner because he worked with kids. He later mentioned the positive and negative aspects for working with children on set. In a sense, he was a teacher for these kids. I think Donner did an excellent job, because making these sort of films is not easy. As for the screenplay, it was written by Chris Columbus, who makes a living with these kind of scripts. Columbus did understand past Spielberg works pretty well.Mikey Walsh (Sean Astin) and his brother, Brand (Josh Brolin) live in a family that is being forced to move in order for a new golf course to be built...unless money is somehow raised to save their home. Mikey happened to stumble across a treasure map depicting a vast fortune hidden away. The two brothers along with rest of the ""Goonies"" gang; Chunk (Jeff Cohen), Mouth (Corey Feldman), Andy (Kerri Green), Stef (Martha Plimpton), and Data (Ke Huy Quan), set out to recover this fortune. Their adventure takes them to the evil Mama Fratelli (Anne Ramsay) and her three sons including the disfigured Sloth (John Matsuzak) who decides to help them. In order to find the treasure, they need to find a way past the Fratellis. Goonies never say die!The cast is filled with young blood who will go on to have excellent careers; namely Sean Astin, Josh Brolin, Joe Pantoliano (one of the Fratelli brothers), and Martha Plimpton. As for this particular film, the performances are fine. The kids definitely have energy to no end, but it can grow stale after awhile. The chemistry between the kids is great and it really feels like they have a bond, which I absolutely loved as a kid. I get why everyone loves Chunk, but I felt his character is too melodramatic and a little annoying. The Fratelli's are moronic villains, but there is a reason why they are everyone favorite's villains. Anne Ramsay, although a little over-the-top, is really fun to watch.Once The Goonies start a-rolling, the action and the thrills do not stop. Some people point out that this film has more to it than most action films. Whether or not that is to your liking will depend on your tastes. The film is loaded with special effects. Some are good, and some...not too good. The music plays well with the film as Cyndi Lauper actually delivered a hit song thanks to the movie. As a child, this film will satisfy your every dream. It has pirate ships, evil cooks, and the sense of adventure. As an adult, this will all depend on your patience. Although I cannot consider the movie a magic-inducing phenomenon it was when I was a kid, I still enjoyed this fast-paced adventure.My Grade: B",The Goonies
88,afonsobritofalves,The biggest comedy of the 80s.,8,21 October 2018,"Although little is known today about this film, it seems that every time I see it seems better, a true masterpiece of cinema.

89,rebeljenn,"One of the funniest, best films of my childhood",8,1 December 2005,"I think that nearly everyone who grew up in the 1980s has seen this film at some point. When I think of 'The Goonies', I am always brought back to my childhood. This is a very 1980s film, and it is very nostalgic for those of us who grew up with it. I would even say that this is one of the best films of my childhood. It had virtually everything going for it: treasure maps, kids in control of their destinies, pirate ships, deformed and misunderstood Sloth, humour with outcast and overweight Chunk, revenge, 'booby' traps, evil/creepy Italians, and I could go on and on. There's a lot this film has going for it, and its highly engaging plot ensures that children will not be bored. Even, it is a little bit silly. The kids make this film what it is, and they are the ones that save the day. They outsmart the evil Fratellis and get the treasure. And, who could not find the scenes with Sloth and Chunk highly amusing, especially when Chunk confesses everything that he has done wrong? This is a pure gem. Very good, and it still brings back laughter into my 20s.",The Goonies
90,Geeky Randy,Geeky Randy's summary,9,6 July 2015,"1980's adventure classic that brings pirate legend into 20th century Astoria, OR. A group of preteens stumble upon clues of a lost treasure nearby and decide to go on one last adventure before their homes are torn down to help expand a country club. Nostalgic but also timeless, offering enough originality to make it memorable while also sticking fairly close to the typical treasure hunt adventure. The character development gives off the feeling like there were so many adventures before and so many more to come but, behold, only one movie was ever made. Ramsey is always a terrific villainess, while Davi and Pantoliano have the right/intentionally-wrong chemistry as her two convict sons who are more interested in bickering and fighting for their mother's love than following the trail of the Goonies. Then we have the side-story of Chunk (Cohen) and Sloth (Matuszak), a duo that is worthy enough to have their own spin-off. Cyndi Lauper's song is also very fitting.***½ (out of four)",The Goonies
91,emm,80s adventure flick revives childhood memories!,7,23 January 1999,"The first time I saw THE GOONIES was at a friend's house right when it was a ""new release"" on video. After the best times I had in my life watching it, the friend established a ""Goonie"" club for the fun of it. Perhaps your past childhood memories would have been the same, too! While the movie is a tad heavy on the stupid foul jokes, it does have the imagination of willing to trek around for some perilous adventures, plus a few spooks. There possibly was never a movie like this providing tons of fun and laughter during the time. The characters and their personalities were most original, including ""Data"" and his supply of gadgets, and ""Chunk"" with his obese but likeable image (love that ""Truffle Shuffle""!). But ""Sloth"" easily stole the show with his own likeable personality, a goon with the weirdest face I've ever seen in my life! Just think of how fun it is to discover lost treasure, when you know it's only fantasy. Four key things come to mind with THE GOONIES: pirate ships, teenagers, the Frattellis, and Cyndi Lauper. They're actually ""good enough"" and they go together in this memorable journey! Kudos to Richard Donner for bringing me a movie that I've seen over 100 times and never stop enjoying! After all these years, I'm STILL waiting for a sequel!HIT PUREE!!!",The Goonies

As someone who wasn't around in 85 to watch it getting to see it on the big screen in this generation was a dream come true.The movie still holds up as one of the best movies made and today still inspires people and makes people smile.It is well shot and the cast is perfect as a band of kids known as the goonies hunt for a lost treasure to save there homes it's a great adventure for all ages and is a true classic.If by some miracle you haven't already seen this masterpiece watch it and join the Goonies around the world who love this classic tale.,The Goonies
93,Min111,A classic adventure,8,16 October 2018,"This is one of my favourite adventure movies of all time. Everything about it is brilliant from start to finish. I remember first watching this being shown on Channel Five in England, and was very excited in watching this - it was enjoyable.In fact, ""The Goonies"" is one of these rare movies that looks better to watch when on television if that makes any sense - that's the impression I seem to get. There's seems to be some nostalgia about it, maybe.Things do begin to start of pretty slowly, but it does finally start picking up the pace later, as the movie progresses, and that's a good thing because the movie gets more and more interesting. The story was brilliant, and easy to understand, a wonderful adventure.The great thing about ""The Goonies"" is that you, the viewer, are always on the kids' side, and are supporting on their goals and adventure, and hope that they sail all the way through; In other words, you actually want them to win, but it seems like the movie actually gives you the impression that they won't.It seems like this movie is a bit unpredictable, and I think that's a good thing. Yes, it's a family, adventure and comedy film, but it's clearly a lot more than that.This movie, sometimes, doesn't get the appreciation it deserves. The rating on IMDb testifies to that. It has a rating just under eight which is still fantastic, but you would think a movie such as ""The Goonies"" would have a rating well pass that, and I don't understand why it doesn't because there's nothing the movie could've done wrong. So, I'm actually surprised by the overall rating for this film.It was also released in the eighties too, and there weren't too many wonderful family films back then, as compared to the nineties, where there were plenty. The vast majority of them I don't think can match up to ""The Goonies"" I feel.There has been talks of a sequel even till today, and whether it's a good thing that it hasn't happened, or a bad thing if it does happen, nobody knows for sure, but the most important thing is that it doesn't really matter if it does or not.Yes, there's plenty of potential on offer for a successful sequel, but I'll leave that to people's imagination regarding the story for a sequel.""The Goonies"" is one of these many movies you could watch again and again, yet still not get bored of it.

Unfortunately three crooks Mama Fratelli (Anne Ramsey) with her sons Jake (Robert Davi) and Francis (Joe Pantoliano) are also seeking the treasure.One of the most beloved movies of the 80's! this outstanding adventure from director Richard Donner and producer Steven Spielberg has made a hilarious and entertaining film for all ages. The film co-stars Josh Brolin in his debut as Brand whom is Mikey's big tough brother, beautiful Keri Green as hottie Andi and the lovable deformed man Sloth played by John Matsuzak all give good performances.This movie still holds up as a modern cult classic that has been embraced over the years, this is a must see.",The Goonies

97,Beejerman,STANDING OVATION! - (10 stars out of 10),10,19 April 2019,"The stage curtains open ...I'm always a little apprehensive in reviewing such good movies, like this one, because I'm afraid my reviews won't do them justice. Such is the case with ""The Goonies"", this classic film from 1985 - which was such an integral part of my teenage years growing up.The story starts out with a tight group of friends, who call themselves the Goonies, spending what is to be their last Saturday together - since they are all about to lose their homes due to foreclosures and have to move to different towns and cities. They want to go out with a bang, so they decide to follow a map they found among some pirate relics in an attic, leading to the hidden treasure of One-Eyed Willy, the greatest pirate of his time. Along the way, they come across the secret hideout of the Fratelli's - a notorious gang on the run from the law. With the Fratelli's on their tail, they endure exciting dangers in tunnels underground while learning the value of friendship, reliance and loss as they try to save their homes and way of life.This movie carries with it some very strong sentimental attachments for me, as I was the same age as most of the Goonies were when the film first came out.. The characters almost became like friends to me: Mikey, Brand, Chunk, Mouth, Data, Andy, Stef ... and even Sloth. With names like those, you know it has to be a fun movie.I can't give this film any higher rating or recommend. Yes, you have to suspend disbelief and just let yourself be entertained. It is a fantasy, yet extremely funny - and it still holds up well even today. I watch it at least once a year, sometimes more, and I can quote the entire movie - line for line (but don't worry, if you were ever to watch this movie with me, I wouldn't actually do that since I know how annoying it can be).

Come up with an ultra-simple plot, execute it with enough effort that it's watchable but by no means great, stereotypical characters who fulfill their roles, play the teen element (as was the new trend during those days), a couple adventure with humor.

You'd think then that I'd remember it well. The gist yes, but the details have been erased, which is what makes reliving it so much fun. It's not a great film, but it's different when you discover something as a child, the quality doesn't matter as much, it's something that speaks to you regardless. Now I grew up in Manchester, far from this seemingly exciting American suburb on the screen. The kids think their town is boring, but to me it was another world. One with big unusual looking houses, wide streets, bikes and adventure. Oh boy the adventure, the Spielberg kind (credited as a co-writer, but his stamp is all over it), wondrous and over the top. The Goonies live in a space without parents, although their escapades are in aid of them, but the screen time is all theirs, misfit kids on a treasure trail intent on making the most of ""our time"". Cue hefty doses of slapstick, teen movie tropes, booby traps, a rousing fantasy score and smaltzy sentimentality.

102,departed07,Long Live The Goonies!,8,20 March 2008,"There must've been at least one or two kids in every household who would punch the hell out of you if you'd never saw ""The Goonies"" or know some of the scenes and characters. I was one of those household kids who cherish this 1985 classic as if watching ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" as a kid where every weekend when I didn't need to do homework, one of my favorite eighties classics would be playing in the VCR from Ghostbusters, Goonies or Raiders of the Lost Ark.The Goonies is about a group of four young boys who are considered losers and outcasts to the popular kids. Mike (Sean Astin) is the leader of the group where he's always being teased and corrected in conversation by his older brother Brandon (Josh Brolin) who's trying to fit in with others. Mike's friend include a chatterbox know-it-all name Mouth (Corey Feldman), an inventor and James Bond fanatic Data (Jonathan Ke Quan), and chubby and great liar Chuck (Jeff Cohan). Mike and Brandon are upset that a group of rich snobs have seized the property of their parents house along with the rest of the community where all the houses and docks are going to be tear down for a country club to be made. Mike and his friends investigate the attic with Brandon where they try to seek any hidden treasures around the city before tying up Mike's brother.There is a subplot behind this comedy caper where the group of boys see that other people are at an abandon building with the treasure being hidden inside. More things are hidden inside as well before Brandon rescues Mike and others for any huge embarrassment. New characters enter from pop tart cheerleader Andy (Kerri Green) to geeky Stephanie (Martha Plimpton) who not only know Brandon and the kids but get involve with them as well with one thing happening over the next.""The Goonies"" is a funny movie where despite a few harsh languages here and there, especially the young kids saying a four letter S word (and I don't mean suck), there's nothing offensive about it.",The Goonies

When I was younger, I was always into the whole Treasure Hunting thing, always making clues and hiding them and having other's find them. The Goonies is basically a treasure hunt, and it's a damn good one too. I watched this mostly just because people were saying how great it was, and how it was one of the movies that inspired one of my favorite films from last year ""Super 8."" Well before I praise this movie, first let me say a few things that bothered me.The character of Chunk, the fat kid, doesn't go in the caves with the rest of the group, and in the last act, we barely see him. Which is a shame. Also some parts seemed a little too adult, I could handle the skeletons, but I can't really see why they put in the scene with the statue's genitals falling off. Also Data's accent got annoying at times, he sounds like Short Round from ""Temple of Doom."" But this movie really put a smile on my face, it's a classic adventure movie about finding a treasure. Like I said, I loved that stuff when I was younger, so this really brought a nostalgia feeling. The characters are great, sure they all fit into a stereotype: fat, Asian, cool, leader, but they all are so funny and likable. I like that they have both kids and teenagers on this journey. That way more people can relate. The villains are great, and the film had me laughing tons of times. I could say more, but I assume most of you have seen this film, and if you haven't, go watch it.The Goonies isn't quite as good as E.T., Close Encounters, or Super 8, but it's still a fun, nostalgic, and very funny ride.

I grew up in the 1980s, and I still remember the scary scenes with the freak in the basement who eats chocolate. For some reason, it touched me a lot, that he was so hungry and starving. I just watched it again on DVD, and it is still pretty good, although somewhat uneven. I think it would have been even better if it had taken place in an old house or a forest or something, instead of the set-like tunnels it actually takes place in. However, the story and energy of the movie is so amazing that one cannot help like it. It is like other great 80s movies such as ""Back to the Future"" a great description of that particular generation.",The Goonies
110,rollernerd,One Eyed Willy's Treasure,7,5 August 2021,"Tonight's movie review is in memory of the great Richard Donner the man who was behind the awesomeness Lethal Weapon series, Scrooged, Conspiracy Theory and the timeless movie Superman. Since this review is paying tribute, tonight's movie review will be children epic adventure The Goonies (1985). Believe it or not this is my first time watching this film this past week and since then I have gone back and forth to question why this particular flick has influenced so many shows and movies including Stranger Things.The story to me is straightforward, what would a bunch of bored kids get up to on a rainy day? Well, in this case, they settled on an adventure to find hidden pirate treasure whilst evading a bickering family of Italian mobsters known as the Fratelli's. The kids are from a blue-collar ""Goon Docks"" district of Astoria, Oregon and a bunch of them are trying to figure out how to save their homes from demolition. When the kids find a map written in Spanish which will lead to pirate treasure, they use the motto of ""our time"" and go onto an epic underground cave adventure. The treasure belongs to the infamous pirate, One Eyed Willy.The film itself starts with a Jolly Roger symbol then a jailbreak and a car chase which has a throwback to the 1930s and 1940s slap stick chasing where the homage is the Spanish housemaid in the middle of the road of a car chase. We see heaps of 60s to 80s throwbacks including the iconic Prince's Purple Rain printed t-shirt worn by 80s child actor Corey Haim and the James Bond theme played while the character Data uses his gadgets to swing from house to house. All this is good and all but there are some mirky weird remarks including the statue reference - why?? And the supposedly funny translation from English to Spanish scene - again not so childlike for a kid's movie. There is one thing I have noticed in the film, the lack of diverse characters. And this isn't getting woke or anything, it was just weird only seeing every specific stereotype except for one diverse family.The movie itself is okay and has some cool parts including the cave waterslide part - any kids true dream to get on that slide and fly mid-air into a pool of water in the end. The scene where the Andy has to play the correct notes on a a skeleton style organ was cool as. There are some coming of age scenes including the pash between Andy and Mikey and Andy and the older brother Brand. All the kids are great and do an awesome part in the film. The scene stealer to me is Chunk, our typical American kid who loves to eat and loves action and is a klutz. Plus, his interrogation and confession scenes were hilarious. The villains in this film are great and the one who really stole the show to me is Anne Ramsey, including her determined look chasing the kids in the cave to telling Corey's character Mouth whether he would like to eat tongue after he was ordering a few Italian dishes. Sean Astin as Mikey was cool and showed that it doesn't matter if you have an asthma pump when you are a kid, you can still achieve anything. And of course, you have you have Sloth, every child's hope that monster lookalikes are in fact good wholesome individuals. Plus, he was wearing a Superman t-shirt.This plus the Cyndi Lauper rack of ""The Goonies 'r' Good Enough"" were a good mix and yes I did watch the Cyndi Lauper clip and it was weird as much as the film where colourful pirates are chasing Cyndi with a sheik in the background is impatiently waiting to demolish a family home. Plus, you have the Hibachi scene!!Going back to the film we see retro kids riding their bikes with mates, seeing a teenager reading guns and ammo in the restroom and a first kiss. But to me this isn't a classic 80s kids film. At best a once or twice over, not a cult classic to me but it's still a good time, overall 7/10.",The Goonies

112,antagonist117,"""The Goonies""'s vision of childhood is flawed, but not so Spielberg and Donner's flair for spectacle",4,13 November 2014,"The children who constitute the Goonies only really exist in the mind of Steven Spielberg, who produced and created the story. He sees boy children as fast-talking, fun-loving, dream-chasing rascals. Girl children older than, say, Drew Barrymore in ""E.T."" are valuable as targets and instigators of boys' sexual precociousness, but are mostly just taggers-along on boys' adventures. How much you like ""The Goonies"" depends in part on whether your perceptions of childhood are as simple and limited as Spielberg's, or whether you see with the jaded eyes of an adult who wants something more from a movie than a middle-aged producer's wish fulfillment.The plot of ""The Goonies,"" a quest for buried pirate treasure on the northern Pacific coast, owes a lot to Mark Twain's tale of Tom, Huck, and Becky in Injun Joe's cave. Twain's kids were wise beyond their years and rough around the edges, a bit like Sean Astin's ""Mikey"" and Corey Feldman's ""Mouth."" But they were also complex figures with rich inner lives, not comic stereotypes like Ke Huy Quan's ""Data,"" who does gadgets, Jeff Cohen's ""Chunk,"" who loves food, and Kerri Green's ""Andy,"" a girl who shrieks and likes jewelry and kissing. Twain's dialogue was characterized by colorful turns of phrase and carefully-observed dialect, but Chris Columbus's screenplay is all shouted exposition, easy barbs, and convenient moments of wisdom.The shouting is the hardest to tolerate as an adult, and unfortunately it is ceaseless. The movie's head baddie, having bundled the Goonies out of the room, exhales a line we're probably supposed to disagree with: ""Kids suck."" During the brief respite from the noise, it's hard not to share her sentiment. The Goonies are pretty obnoxious, but the movie doesn't know it.Whatever their flaws in the character department, Spielberg, Columbus, and director Richard Donner are no slouches when it comes to cinematic spectacle. ""The Goonies"" is longer than it should be, but it moves so fast that it seldom lags. The dungeon and pirate ship sets look great, and for buffs there are plenty of winking homages to great adventure films like ""Captain Blood,"" ""Tarzan,"" and ""Raiders of the Lost Ark."" As if to compensate for the underwritten child roles, Dave Grusin's musical score does a great deal of emotional lifting and at times obscures the ubiquitous screaming.Even if you find the Goonies less than lovable, the filmmakers' fondness for them is apparent and a little infectious. A final scene on the beach gives each child a neat resolution and some parting words (several of which are painfully unearned) before capping things off with a moment of hushed, magical awe. However uneven the underlying content, it is hard to resist the appeal of a totally un-cynical moment of Spielbergian wonder.",The Goonies
113,the_wolf_imdb,Incredibly disappointing movie,1,23 August 2008,"Well I have been prepared to see kids movie. Most of the viewers seem to be happy with this move but I just keep to wonder why. It is very chaotic, hardly funny and quite abusive I have to say. But the worst part is it is actually very boring movie. From start to the end there is just sequence of screaming, did the viewers who mentioned their childhood memories keep their youth with never ending shouting like ""UAAAAAAA!!!"" ""IIIIIIIIII!!!"" ""NOOOOOOOO!!!!"" ""UAHAAAAAAA!"" ""WE GOT IT!!!"" ""NOOOOOOO!"" ""HEEEEEELP!!!"" ""WHAAAAATS THAAAAAT?!"" et cerera et cerera. Everyone in the movie is just plain silly - children, parents, police, everyone. The only exception are banditos who are simply brain dead. Its stupid, its just stupid. It's disgusting, literally two hours walk in sewage filled with sewage humor. I'm very happy I've seen this movie on TV and pay nothing for this most unpleasant experience. I'm really happy I have not bought it because I would be very angry because of money wasted.",The Goonies
114,Christopher_Reid,"A fun, goofy ride",8,11 February 2016,"The Goonies is a wonderful children's film featuring suicide, torture, a deformed man chained up in a confined room, deadly booby traps, a frozen dead body, kidnapping, gunshots, foreclosure, an old lady threatening to cut off children's tongues and skeletons. It's probably the best family horror movie of all time. But seriously, it's hard to believe all this stuff is in a kid's movie. It just goes to show how powerful tone is. Because the music is never too dark and there's no nudity or swearing and because the children are all basically guaranteed to survive to the end, no-one bats an eye.The Goonies works because of its energy and innocence. It's a bunch of children being children, going on an adventure to find a hidden treasure in order to hopefully save their parents from having to foreclose their houses. None of the actors are slack, they all jump right into their roles. It reminded me of the raw energy of Star Wars, the way Luke and Leia say silly lines so sincerely and they seem so passionate about everything they do.The characters are a big part of the movie's success. They shout over each-other, tell each-other to ""shut up"", laugh and scream together. They make fun of each-other which is one of those signs of long term friendship. They know Chunk so well they can count down to when he'll drop something and break it. They infuriate him enough to make him unwittingly break down a door and then thank him afterwards as they walk over his body. They make him do a silly dance before letting him into a house. The gate is opened by a wacky, overly complex sequence of events including a chicken laying an egg and a balloon popping. I'm guessing Data invented it.I really liked the music by Dave Grusin. I'm not sure I've seen any of his other movies. But it sounded interesting all the way through. Not simply underlining the action or on the other extreme being distracting but adding lots of colour and variety. I really feel like I need to listen to the soundtrack to properly appreciate all the details and get familiar with the music.There is a lot of slapstick comedy in this movie. Joe Pantoliano asks for a sword from his Mother. She hands it to him and he yells as the blade part goes onto his hand by mistake. I was reminded of Home Alone and Baby's Day Out. The movie achieves a safe, silly, comedic atmosphere where everything just becomes fun. There is danger but it's fun danger. We hold our breath as the bad guys get closer and then laugh out loud as they slip and hurt themselves. We gasp when a bad guy appears out of nowhere and then cheer as another character swoops in to rescue the day.I get the impression many people love The Goonies from childhood and have watched it regularly for decades. I saw a lot of 80s movies as a kid but somehow The Goonies was left out. I don't know if it's great but it's a very likable and fun movie and I can see myself growing fonder of it with time. I think it's perfect family entertainment that a lot of children would find hilarious. My favourite things about it were Chunk, the bumbling and arguing villains, the sense of adventure and the cast of quirky, funny characters.Sean Astin is the heart of the movie and gives a solid performance that puts many adults to shame. He has braces and takes a puffer for asthma making him seem more vulnerable and innocent but he's not weak at all. I have to say, I loved when Chunk started confessing every naughty little thing he's ever done. And of course the part when he suddenly stopped talking and noticed some ice cream. Anyway, good movie.",The Goonies
115,karl_consiglio,My memories of the eighties,3,8 October 2006,"I give this film a low score today of course but God knows I loved it when I was a kid and used to watch it over and over. The Goonies is one of the things I remember of the eighties. America was very much in vogue back then, unlike now. I think they had Reagen back then and it was a much nicer and less scary world. My brother and I used to think the Goonies was so cool and their adventures were the very adventures we used to dream of at that age, it was only healthy after all to dream of such things and maybe write about it in your school essays, you know discovering a pirate ship and all. Yes I used to get my kicks and good vibes from this kind of film.",The Goonies

But not me. It is just So Stupid. I recently rewatched it, but only because I haven't seen it in any significant manner since I first saw it when I was 15. It is still awful. Not camp, not fun, just stupid. Everything is so telegraphed a mile in advance, so obviously set up that it's not perilous, interesting, or funny.There are a thousand ruined gags, but just take one as it's simple to explain. At the house before they all leave, one of the kids jumps and sits on the kitchen counter. But no, he sits in the sink. IN. The Sink. Then, someone else as a minor prank turns on the water to the sink. Minor hijinks. Guy sitting in sink is surprised he gets wet. But dude, you are in a sink. No one does this. No one acts even a little like any of these people. I was a kid then, and basically the same age as these actors. They are not exaggerated versions of 80s kids, but are made up Hollywood cartoon kids. No one acts like this. At all. Fake reality is what we go to movies for. Fakey fakeness is what?

It has everything in it, great acting, production, directing, photography, script, costumes set decoration, art direction, etc. I give this film 10/10 stars. Kudos to the cast, crew, and filmmakers. Two Thumbs Way Up!Spoilers Coming Up!My siblings and I have many favorite parts in this movie. These include: when Chunk spots the police chasing the Fratelli's and runs over to window and spills shake on himself. Also, the part when Chunk does the dance at the Walsh's house so they will let him in, when Jake Fratelli is too stupid to know what up means, and when they find the hidden treasures.I like how Chunk takes in Sloth at the end.

120,jake-law123,Such a good adventure.,7,5 May 2014,"Haven't seen this till just recently, even though most people have seen this from childhood. I honestly regret it, it was such a fun movie. It centers around a group of little kids trying to find a pirate treasure using a map from the main kid's attic, which is a map of the city. They make their way to a cave within the mountains to get to the X, while being pursued by a group of bandits. Classic story that everybody knows and loves, and I haven't until now.Actors Sean Astin, Josh Brolin, Corey Feldman, and others as kids, trying to find a pirate treasure, how can you go wrong. The characters are all unique in their own ways, and are fun to be around. Even the ones that are annoying, you learn to love. Chunk is a classic character, but when I saw him, it's like ""oh, they're trying to make him annoyingly charming, oh brother he's just annoying"", but by the end of the movie, he was one of my favorite characters, so funny. There's so much fantasy and excitement in the film, it just lifts you up and makes you want to experience it yourself.One thing i'll complain about is that writing in the first half of the film is just kids screaming at one another and not being able to hear what anybody is saying, it gets a bit thinner later one, but still. That's about it, other than that I enjoyed the film to no end. Such a good adventure that, while i'm sad to have missed out on as a kid, am so glad that I got to be a part of now.",The Goonies

Adventurous action, humorous scenes (just remember the one, when one of the kid at the start of the movie translate stupidities to the spanish talking maid), great movie music (the opening music is definetly one of best I ever heard) and an ""Indiana Jones"" scenes. Combinig that you get the movie almost every kid like. Or an adult. It is fun to watch and it certainly bring memories back, when everybody wants to be a Goonie. All in all, it maybe not a classic such as Neverending story 1 or E.T., but it's close. Very close.That's why, a great8 out of 10",The Goonies

There is no ulterior motive in the movie other than entertainment and in this regard it is a winner.A sure fire classic,The Goonies
123,caseynicholson,You're Not Going to Find a Better Hokey 80's Movie,9,30 January 2015,"This past weekend a local theater in my hometown showed Steven Spielberg's ""The Goonies"" on the big screen. I made it a point to go, as this is one of those movies that I know that I'd seen a time or two when I was a kid, but I also somehow managed not to ever see it in a theater when it came out. That may have been due to the slight bit of language in the film, which my mother probably deemed inappropriate for a seven year old. But what I know is that this is the kind of film that I either had watched at a friend's house during a sleepover or on TV with alterations, and as such was a movie that I had seen in bits and pieces, but perhaps not all the way straight through. At the very least I hadn't watched it in a very long time.Having now viewed the movie in a theater as an adult, I can say that it's an 80's masterpiece. The film follows a group of boys all of whom appear to be about 12 years old, along with their older, high school aged brother and a couple of girls from his school, all of whom set out (some unwittingly) on a scavenger hunt to find a buried treasure. The hunt finds them encountering a group of thieves who had robbed a bank in the movie's opening scenes, and the basic gist of the film is the hunt for the treasure while trying to evade these antagonists.What makes this movie special is that it's such a wonderfully told story, with fun characters and childish humor that is at both one and the same time juvenile and yet endearing. The film is perfect for youth who are coming of age, with a style that encompasses both child fantasy and adult themes. It's a great film for 11-15 year olds, but also for adults who just like fun movies. As I mentioned above, there is a very slight bit of language in the film, so perhaps my mother was right for not letting me see it as a seven year old. But, again, older kids should love it.The real genius of this movie, though, is that it's a perfect example of an iconic 80's teen movie. It's wonderfully hokey but still a real pleasure to watch. I give it 9/10 stars!",The Goonies

Saw it again a few weeks ago in celebration of the 30 years Goonies has been around. Still find it to be a nice and fun movie. Yeah sure a lot of the stuff would require you to suspend your disbelief. In some cases quite a large bit but that's the best part. One of my favorite scenes in general of film is when the three main villains were asking the fat kid Chunk about him telling them everything and he gave away all his worst secrets. That scene was funny back then and is even funnier now when I see it a few years older. I was surprised to head that Sean Astin was in this movie. The person who played Sam in the Lord of the Rings movies about fifteen years later. Sloth is a very enjoyable character who always brings a smile to my face and the way he acts is one of the funniest I have ever seen. I would suggest that you check this movie out. It's a lot of fun but as stated before you would have suspend your disbelief a bit.,The Goonies

126,bannonanthony,"""Jerk Alert!""",10,14 June 2005,"I have loved THE GOONIES ever since I was a kid and I don't think I'll ever get tired of it. A young Sean Astin performs excellently as the group's pseudo-leader Mikey. Corey Feldman provides plenty of laughs as the mischievous Mouth (I loved the bit where he 'translates' Mikey's mother's instructions to the Spanish maid into Spanish). The rest of the group are colourful, with each one being made an individual. The late John Matuszak is great as the deformed Sloth who ultimately helps to save the day and the villainous Fratelli family are portrayed in a very funny light as well.The only really hateful villains are the country club crowd who want to tear down the Goonies' houses to build a golf course, which is why our group embark on their journey for buried treasure in the first place. The underground caverns and the various booby traps set by pirate One-Eyed Willy are very brilliantly done. There's also great music by Dave Grusin. I recommend THE GOONIES strongly. It's a great, fun movie.",The Goonies
127,reddragonhero17,Goonies NEVER say die!!!,10,26 June 2017,"That one quote rings most perfect to this movie. It doesn't matter how old it is, or how old you are watching this movie, it's timeless and ageless. This really brings back the magic of childhood with its sense of wonder. The Goonies themselves are all memorable in one way shape or form. Sean Astin definitely deserved an award for this role as the de facto leader of the group, but you've got to hand it to Jeff Cohen (Chunk) for his acting ability. In fact he steals half the show with his antics (long live the Truffle Shuffle!). I love the traps the group encounters as they're all creative, my personal favorite is the bone piano; you certainly don't see that everyday. But the ending is just great when you find out hope is restored when Rosalita finds the gems to save the homes that Mikey stashed in his bag. I end this review with this quote: ""Hey you guys!""",The Goonies
128,blazesnakes9,Sort of a teenage version of Raiders of the Lost Ark,7,11 October 2013,"In 1981, director Steven Spielberg made an adventure movie called ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"". That film features one of the most popular action hero, Indiana Jones. In that film, Spielberg's tale was about a archaeologist, who tries to retrieve the Ark, which was stolen by the Nazis. The concept of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is also used in the new adventure film called ""The Goonies"". The Goonies tells the story about a bunch of kids, who lives in Astoria, Oregon. They like to go on certain types of situations together, considering that they're all misfits. When one of the kids stumbles upon a treasure map in his own attic that belongs to an old pirate named One-Eyed Willie, the Goonies set off on their last adventure. The problem is that greedy real estate buyers want to foreclosure the house and the kids must save it before it is gone. Well, the Goonies runs into troubles on their own as well, Three bumbling bad guys are also chasing and going after the Goonies as they descent more and more underground. I thought the underground set design was impressive though I had some questions about the caves and one concerning a well but, nevertheless, convincing. The idea of the underground caves is probably set to be a kids' hideout of some sort. But, never mind about that. Anyway, the film gets better as the kids falls through all kinds of booby traps. The booby traps are sort of ripped right out of the Indiana Jones movies, specifically the first one and the second one. The ideas behind this movie gets even more better. An giant man named ""Sloth"", who has a grotesque, deformed looking face, joined the gang, and also several girls are added to the list of characters. There is a lot of fun in The Goonies. I admired its energy and its style. But, there are questions that I ask myself when watching The Goonies. Those questions weren't important as the movie. Basically, this is nothing more than a funny, exciting, thrilling teenage adventure story. One other thing that I didn't mention. Some of the young actors who played the Goonies, like Sean Astin and Josh Brolin were good as the roles they presented. And, also, I enjoyed the supporting characters as well. Anne Ramsey, who plays the mother of the two criminals who are chasing the kids in the underground caves is pretty good is this movie. She's convincing and intimidating as the supporting character. ★★★ 3 stars.",The Goonies

The rating is quite high, many people have seen the movie, there's been a video game inspired by it, ... and there's Spielberg who produced and wrote the film. Then it MUST be good?  Think again! The truth is that this is an inconceivable mess. Whoever thought this was funny, should be locked up and put away forever. There's not even a chuckle during the whole length of the film. And I can assure you that this film seems to be going on forever! So is it entertaining then? Surely not. This film is as boring and stupid as it gets. Imagine a bunch of irritating children( all with some sort of speaking disorder, it seems), yelling their way through the ""story"". Think of PROBLEM CHILD, LOOK WHO'S TALKING TOO, even the POLICE ACADEMY FILMS... get the picture? Not yet? Then picture three idiotic villains (does Joe Pantaliano even recall his ""performance"" here?), a search for a hidden treasure (it takes a while to figure that out)and some sort of friendly ""monster"" (that reminded me of THE TOXIC AVENGER!), all of which seems awfully out of place in this film. Of course, this is a children's movie, I can understand that. And, like so many others of its kind, it's stupid, very stupid. And I guess you have to be a kid yourself to enjoy such films. But ""stupid"" doesn't actually mean ""bad"". There are many enjoyable, clever and sweet ""family films"". But this loud-mouthed, dumb mess isn't one of them. Oh, and there's actually a scene in which there's being referred to GREMLINS, another Spielberg production from a year before this one.

It captures the bond among a group of pre-adolescent boys (although the actors playing them were certainly adolescents) which, with all its rough-housing and name-calling, is fundamentally unswerving and tolerant of differences. Chunk's behavior may make the viewer want to cast him out, but his friends never even consider it. In a way, the boys' fellowship is emphasized by contrast with the relationships among the teenagers portrayed which already are distorted by dominance issues and sexual attractions. My one requirement for a movie with young protagonists, over and above decent acting and production values, is that the characters be true human ""persons,"" -- who make decisions for themselves, act on them, and, for good or ill, experience their consequences.",The Goonies

I mean, it was okay; I didn't loathe it or so, but it was never something special for me. Never. The actors are doing a nice job, you can't complain about that, and the story itself isn't even boring nor weak. What I didn't like was the odd malformed guy. I did neither like his character nor his physical appearance. He's so dumb, in my eyes. So, what do I make of The Goonies?

138,richkiel,Great kids' movie,9,3 November 2021,"I hate children in movies. They tend to spoil everything. They by and large can't act, and they are often given bad lines. The Goonies is one of very few movies that revolve around children that I happen to enjoy. It's one of my favourite films from childhood.There are some things I don't particularly like, though. For instance, I don't think the bad guys were even needed for the film. The plot is a hidden gold mystery with pirates, and the addition of the bad guys shatters that whole pirate lore and turns it into a straight action film with baddies with guns chasing the kids. While their presence does add a sense of urgency and the kids are always on the run, this was not necessary. I would have preferred the story to revolve around these kids trying to survive all the booby traps. Also, the 'Sloth' character is too grotesque to be endearing, and I don't like him at all. They threw too much into the plot, and overburdened it needlessly. They should have kept it a lot more simple. It should have been a mystery with some clever booby traps, not the kids fleeing the bad guys. Especially if the bad guys are completely useless. I never knew whether to fear the baddies or laugh at their incompetence. At the end of the day, the baddies are too goofy to be scary. So what do we need them for? As useless punching bags for the kids to beat? I don't want that. Who wants that?",The Goonies

I thought ""The Goonies"" was supposed to be a great exciting kids-adventure, but this is a horrible thing from start to end. Everything in this film could be so much better. It is never exciting and never funny, even if it somehow tries to be funny with stupid jokes. The characters are empty all over and really uninspiring. You just want to stop watching. The end is stupid and without any kind of joy, the villains are not really menacing or frightening as I thought they would be, they are just dull. The film doesn't have the guts to take it self seriously any time. And I really hate irritating fat children in movies that just can eat and scream! If you want to experience proper 1980's adventure films you could see 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' or 'Stand by Me' instead.Richard Donner proved that he can direct entertainment with ""The Omen"" but ""The Goonies"" was a big mistake, with horrible bad uninspired direction - all the acting was worse than it could be and the film didn't have any atmosphere or mood at all.

Tons of bickering chatter, gratuitous product placement, hijinks-action and toilet humor make this flick, which could be retitled THE GARBAGE PALE OUTSIDERS VISIT THE TEMPLE OF DOOM, more suited for teens than children. Three villainous yet goofy thugs provide filler as they thwart the Gonnie's quest: which, despite the grandiose musical score, is really just a lot of running around.

It's got everything you want - action, comedy, a little bit of romance, adventure, and it all revolves around young teenagers!God, I really wanted to be one of those guys - I'd like to think of myself as a Mouth type character, but the reality was, that I was Chunk type character. That's what's also so good about this film, you have all the stereotypical kids in this movie - from the fat stupid kid, to the brainy kid who is just a little bit too brainy!We all know the plot - or at least we should, and it's a good one too.The film has a nice appeal to it, me and some mates watched it very recently, and though it seems a little dated, it still is a lot of fun to watch. Now that we're older (all roughly 20/21) we get the subtle nuances of the jokes. I mean is it just me? or did I completely miss the sexual reference to 'One Eyed Willy'????!!!!!!!!! I'm soooo naive!!watch this film, re-visit your childhood and enjoy a great piece of the 80's.9/10",The Goonies

We are given some of the most memorable characters such as Chuck, Data (slick shoes anyone?), Mouth, and Mikey.  The villains, those infamous Fratellis, are a blast to watch.  Everything feels so 80's, much like the Breakfast Club or Mannequin. Not to mention Cyndi Lauper!  Goonies are good enough ... oh yeah.  Some people have to understand that when something struck a chord within a child, the experience will carry on until adulthood, and I guess that's the case for me, as well as for the many, many generations who grew up listening to Pet Shop Boys or Duran Duran.

And from then on, every time it was shown on tv, which was a lot. I would watch it, i would cancel playing out with my friends to watch it. It was just so addictable. It's the perfect family film, with comedy and scares for both youngsters and adults. The characters are easily relatable and instantly memorable. The soundtrack dated but fitting to the movie. Its just fun all the way really. Extremely well directed by Donner, who manages to get great acting from the young stars. It's a classic slice of nostalgia.

Honestly, this is the only decent film that Sean Astin and Corey Feldman were in to me. Also, this exposed Cyndi Lauper to me for the first time in my life. And now I like listening to her from time to time. The kicker here is that The Goonies 2 or whatever sequel has not happened yet.

Sometimes I do really question the American culture and especially when kids are involved. I expected this film to be something like Stand by me, but it turned out to be like Super 8 which was okay too. When you mix fantasy with reality, it should be handled very meticulously, there should be a fine line that not only separates fantasy and relaity both but also respects both the varieties. The Goonies literally fails here; when it began with some mild performances, I was put off by how the loud kids were, sure kids are meant to be loud and childish, but how come did they talk like how mature men do? How did they used the terminology of some aspects that was completely out of their thought process?Maybe this was the film made for kids and they liked it but I'm not sure if I should consider it as a coming of age film. No. It might have been a hit back when it released in 1985, but today it looks as if it just doesn't matter. I didn't care for most of the actors, except Josh Brolin cause he acted with sense. The guy who spoke fluent Spanish too was good enough. Everyone else didn't just catch my mind. I expected some real strong emotional bonding like the kids ahd in Stand By Me. Here what I saw was just simple mischiefs and trying to carry out abrupt laughter through them. I'd say 3 Idiots is a better film than this whuch at least has some message in it that can change lives. 4/10.",The Goonies
148,RyanEberhart,Another All Time Favorite!,10,25 July 2013,"The Goonies is another of my favorite movies of all time. Who hasn't watched this many times over the years? When I was growing up many friends wanted to go on adventures like the kids in this movie.Mikey, Mouth, Chunk, Data and Brand are the Goonies. They find a treasure map and all except Brand think it will lead to something. Something that will save their homes. They have to over come obstacles and booby traps as well as being chased by three dangerous criminals, the Fratellis. They enlist the help of Andy and Stef along the way. Another enlistee is an unlikely ally in Sloth, who is a Fratelli, but is mistreated because he is physically and mentally impaired.The Goonies first encounter the Fratellis at an old restaurant along the coast. The restaurant is the starting point for the treasure map. They decide to wait until the Fratellis leave to explore the restaurant. The Fratellis come back unexpectedly while the Goonies are in the basement. Their only way out is to go through a secret passage in the fireplace. Chunk is left behind because he got trapped in a freezer when they found a dead body. Chunk escapes the basement through a window but is later picked up at the side of the road by... the Fratellis.Meanwhile Mikey, Mouth, Data, Brand, Andy and Stef continue on with the treasure hunt. They come across several booby traps and the remains of a former treasure hunter. They find a key around the neck of Chester Copperpot, the dead treasure hunter, and then set off a booby trap that drops large boulders from high above that are meant to crush intruders.Next the Goonies find a well and they think for a split second that they have found the treasure. Unfortunately all they found was a wishing well. A suitor of Andy's, Troy, happens to toss a coin in the wishing well. The Goonies throw the coin back up and he offers to help them out of the well. Mikey talks the others into continue on the treasure hunt.Back at the restaurant the Fratellis question Chunk. After finding out that the tunnel in the fireplace really exists the Fratellis leave chunk tied up in the same room where Sloth is kept. Chunk and Sloth become friends. Sloth breaks free and helps Chunk to get free. Sloth hears his echo coming from the tunnel in the fire place and follows it, leaving Chunk no choice but to follow.While in the well the Goonies find another booby trap that nearly kills Data, but he saves himself by using his ""pinchers of Hell"". They climb down into another tunnel. Having decided to get a pitstop out of the way Andy decides that it is time to make a move on Brand. Brand sends Mikey to see what Andy wants and ends up getting kissed by Andy. Andy thinks it was Brand that she was kissing.The next obstacle is a log bridge over a raging river. Data is the last to cross and he sprays oil along the log to slow the Fratellis down. It works.The next booby trap the Goonies find is a piano made of bones with a skeleton as the a head piece. Andy has to play the notes on the back of the treasure map in order to help the rest of the Goonies to continue on their quest. If Andy fails to play the correct notes the floor will drop away and they will fall to their deaths. Each correct note opens a door little by little so they can keep going. Andy is able to play the correct notes just in time as the Fratellis are right on their heels.The Goonies escape and come to a water slide type obstacle. The treasure map turns out to be real. The Goonies find the treasure of One Eyed Willie. The Goonies start loading the treasure into their pockets. Mikey empties his marble bag and puts several jewels inside. But before they can gather any treasure and get away from the Fratellis, the Fratellis show up and capture them. Chunk and Sloth catch up to everyone and help the Goonies to escape.As the Goonies and the Fratellis escape the cave that One Eyed Willie's ship is in the cave walls begin to fall in, eventually allowing the ship to set sail again. The police find the Goonies and the Fratellis walking up the beach. The Goonies' parents are called and they all have a joyful reunion. Eventually the jewels are found in Mikey's marble bag and they help to save the homes of the Goonies' families.I was six years old when this movie came out. I loved watching this movie every chance I could. Now that I have it on DVD I can watch it every day if I want to. For a kids movie it's pretty good, even nearly thirty years old. The acting is pretty good for a bunch of child actors, not forced. The action is pretty good; the story was pretty good. A lot of comedy; a lot of laughs.",The Goonies

The gang decide that they need to find a way to help Mikey and Brand's parents who can't come up with the money to save the house. They go into the attic to look around for something valuable and they come across an old treasure map that will lead to a treasure that used to belong to a pirate named One Eyed Willie.Along the way they run into the Fratelli's who are wanted for counterfeit. The Fratelli's try to go after the gang after they find Chunk who has gone to get help from the police. Chunk tells the Fratelli's that his friends went down the fireplace. Adventure follows.The Goonies have a wonderful cast. The late Anne Ramsey who plays Mama Fratelli qualifies as meanest mother ever. Even her own sons take a beating from her during the film. I love the little arguments she has between her and Mouth.My biggest problem with the film is that they don't decide to put the Octopus scene back in. You hear Data talk about it but we never see it.

Follow along as they turn into pirates, friends and equals, then into kids again as they are-rescued finally on the beach.

The story is fantastic and is like a teen Indiana Jones adventure movie. The cast is perfect. From Sean Astin's Mikey to Josh Brolin's Brand, all the kids are fantastic in the movie, and they really act like kids, screaming one over the other, insulting each other, doing stupid things and that's a really great thing.The action and the adventure moments of the movie are fantastic. It's just pure fun and entertainment and it sure has some of the best moments of this kind of movies (I specially like the part in the ship and the parts where they're trying to avoid the ""booty traps"").

Anyway, the Goonies is a very silly film. You get the impression they are on a film set at Universal Studios the entire time. Nothing is remotely believable. Also at any given moment in the film, at least 2 to 3 characters are speaking at the same time, usually shouting. It gets annoying quickly.

Because in my opinion, the older ones serve as reminders of how it used to be.I remember when I was that age, and I watch them on bikes and hanging out in their 'goonie' world. It is (excuse the oxymoron) almost exactly how I used to act with friends when the world was our own magical empire. We were never out to hurt anyone and we knew everyone in the neighbourhood and they knew us. The worst thing that could happen to us as kids was getting called in to supper when it got dark.I'm giving this film a ten, because of what it represents and how it does things. It reminds me how things used to be before I had to start being responsible for my life on a bigger scale.I think, though society has changed and kids are just not the same anymore (me being second generation in my late twenties), there is a goonie in everyone somewhere, and this film brings it out, and makes me laugh every time.

160,nickthegun,Goonies r good enough,10,23 October 2002,"Anyone who grew up in the 80's will list the Goonies as one of their favourite films, or at least look back at it with a misty eye.It had everthing you could want, thrills, spills, pirates, booty, adventure, freaks and bad guys. I just wanted to be a Goonie or go on a Goonie style adventure. Even the place where they lived was cool. A big old house in a picturesque bay town. You don't get houses like that in England. The only interesting thing you would have found in my loft would have been a dead pidgeon.Then there were the Goonies themselves who just seemed so cool. Data's gadgets and smart mouthed ..erm.. Mouth.We are first introduced to them one by one in the fantastic introductory sequence. The bad guys of the piece, the Fratellis, organise a jailbreak in a huge 4x4. In the process of doing so they speed past every member of the Goonies, introducing their character traits. Then they all get together at the leader Mikies house and just doss around for a while feeling sorry for themselves, because a property magnate wants to but there little town and turn it into a country club (although the bay looks like it would make a poor golf course, but hey). So this is the Goonies last day together and they have to do something about it. And don't they just.What follows is like a comedy Hardy Boys crossed with a game of Mousetrap. Some of the set pieces are genius (the pirate, One eyed Willie, had a penchant for elaborate traps to stop people pinching his booty) and the sets are equally inventive. The gang get themselves into various scrapes with the traps, or the Fratellis or both and somehow always come out on top.Richard Donner's direction is always brisk, the young actors performances are superb (specially the fantastic 'Chunk'), the senior cast is very good and the dialogue is chock full of hilarious lines.I must admit I look back at it through rose tinted glasses. I was in awe of it when I was a kid, and now when I watch it, it reminds me of my childhood and all the things that was great about it. I cant fault the Goonies, even now.

Who doesn't remember digging under the porch, in creekbeds, hollowed out logs, etc to find the buried treasure you just KNOW is hidden there somewhere?  The Goonies is a fun-filled ride right back into our youth where treasure hunts are no longer a thing of the past.I absolutely loved this movie.  It was just so much fun to watch when I was a kid and just as much fun when I watched it again as an adult with my own kids.  Of course the movie has moments of predictability, and no, the villains aren't all that intimidating...they're actually quite moronic. But that only adds to the charm of this movie as well as its comedic value. Although there are lessons peppered in (don't judge by appearances, right vs. wrong, etc), overall, The Goonies is a wonderful exploration of childhood friendships and imaginations...from Data and his many scientific creations to One Eyed Willy and his pirate ship.There isn't a character in this movie I didn't fully enjoy watching...you have the dim-witted, evil Fratelli's, heavy-set, melodramatic Chunk, Data with his ""booty traps...that's what I said, booby traps"" galore, the odd-looking but loveable Sloth, and Mouth with his, well, Mouth.  Those are only a few...there are many more.  A lot of great lines come from this movie along with memorable moments (the Truffle Shuffle).  I've seen The Goonies about a hundred times and I STILL enjoy watching it over and over again.

The menus are fun to play with, the special features include outtakes (including the infamous octopus scene), full length commentary featuring donner, and all the goonies (except sloth, who is deceased).  The best feature is the two part music video for Cyndi Lauper's ""Good Enough"" song. If you've never seen it, i'll describe it: it features lots of the original WWF wrestlers (remember when wrestlers were like super heroes and super villians not just a bunch of oversized rednecks?) like Andre The Giant and Rowdy Roddy Piper! The dvd is presented in widescreen, so you get that great movie experience you come to expect from DVDs.  The cut is remastered, of course.Nostalgia is very important with a movie like this.  It might not have the most original plot, or the best acting, but for anyone who grew up with this movie, it's possible that this movie can instil the greatest feeling of nostalgia in us 20 somethings.  I practically have to hold back the tears everytime I hear ""good enough.""

Very high budget film of the time most likely. Very nicely shot like many films of this time period they spared no expense. I really liked the adventuresome storyline that shows a unrealistic/realistic trouble this group of kids called The Goonies get themselves into. There is the cute boy/girl aspect to the brother and the girlfriend. I love the Chinese kid Data and his totally wacked out gadget belt. This movie is not overrated in any sense. I would have loved to see this in the movie theater but it came out when I was a baby.

168,nEoFILM,Classic,9,28 March 2011,"I first watched this seminal 80's classic in 1988, when it first appeared on TV and I was blown away by it. I was 10, roughly the same age as the lads and here was a film with a raucous sense of humour, strong child characters and large-scale plot which has made this film a multi-generational classic, with our parents, us as parents and our children all investing in the spirit of adventure of The Goonies.Named after the Goon Docks of which they inhabit, a group of kids, after finding a treasure map, decide that this is their last chance to save the town, which is to knocked down in favour of a Country Club. This leads them on an adventure through the booby-trapped underground catacombs of the town, as they follow the map to One Eyed Willie's treasure.They get mixed up with the Fratelli's, a matriarchal crime family who get wind of the treasure and follows them into the caves.The first ting that struck me about this, is after all these years what that it was still fun, enjoyable and even though I might not bother watching by myself, I would defiantly enjoy seeing again with the right audience. The raucous nature of a group of children together in a room is captured so expertly here, with a young Sean Austin, now famous for his portrayal of Samwise Gamgee in the Lord Of The Rings trilogy, holding the pack together; but the chaos is portrayed perfectly.The language is good here too, with casual swearing amongst the kids, meaning that this must be one of the rare family films to truly capture the interplay between tweenage and teenage kids. Overall, this is a classic for all the right reasons, with the story by Steven Spielberg with only goes to further reinforce his status as one of Hollywood's greatest visionaries and a sharp, tight screenplay by Chris Columbus, who penned Gremlins the previous year and went on to direct the first two, but the weakest two Harry Potter movies.There is also the questionable issue of the way that the Fratelli's treat Chunk. When you think about it he is threatened with torture after being kidnapped and spending time with the murdered corpse of two 'Feds' who have been shot in the head, murdered in cold blood.I love this, treating the horror in a mature way, allowing it to used as humour but in a way to playfully scare kids, which it does. It is fun, but I do wonder where the PC brigade would let some of these plot points go in to a child friendly romp in 2011? I hope so, as it is the combination of elements that made this film what it is today.",The Goonies
169,JohnBoyRoy,Find the child inside yourself! (not in a Gary Glitter sense),7,6 April 2004,"The Goonies is one of those brilliant little films that are best watched on a rainy sunday afternoon*The sense of adventure that Donner creates is brilliant (I would suspect that the insight into child psychology Spielberg has helped him along the way, however).  The pacing of the film and its set-up is perfection - the children have seeminly no way to save their beloved homes (the most important place to yound adolescents) but their is a glimmer of hope with a fluke attic based discovery; and we've all, at some stage, gone snooping around in the attic looking for treasure (usually only finding our dad's secret porn stashes, sadly).The Fratellis are the best crime family ever created (after the Corleones) it really is as simple as that.  Check out Ma Fratelli giving a young Sean Austin (Mikey) a glass of whisky, and when he looks on in shock, stating ""It's wet ain't it!""Sloth is a living god, as is everyones favourite chuck-a-lunk Lawrence ""Chunk"".  Fieldman shines as ""Mouth"".My only problem with the film is that it was not made with the intention of ageing well - its cleary an eighties film - which is no bad thing if you are a buff of the era, but may be hard to stomach if you're new to the film.A bit of a sleeper hit, and a modern classic. 7/10  Highly recommend it.*For imdb users in Africa and India this may not apply.",The Goonies

171,whitesheik,Horrible,1,28 June 2009,"I sat with amusement reading these ridiculous ""reviews"" on The Goonies. Ninety-nine percent of them written by people who saw it when they were five or eight and who are 80s children. Well, what a stinker it is. I've avoided it like the plague all these years, but now I've seen it and I'm here to tell you I almost threw my shoe through the TV. The ""characters"" are so unrelentingly stupid and irritating, the ""script"" is one bad sequence after another and loaded with some of the worst dialogue I've ever heard in a mainstream film. It is a career low for everyone, if you ask me. You know, I saw lots of movies when I was a kid (not in the 80s) and while I can think back with fondness on some of them, I'm also not living in my past - and I can recognize that while it may have been swell when I was five, while it may hold some nostalgia value, I can also recognize a stinker when I see one from my past.But that's the deal with 80s children - they don't grow up. Same with 90s and the 2000s. Nobody grows up - thirty is the new ten and the world is not a pretty place. The one redeeming feature of The Goonies is its Dave Grusin score, which is terrific. Simply put, one of the worst movies I've ever seen and I've seen some doozies.",The Goonies

This is where this movie begins to shine.And... I actually found myself rooting for these characters and ended up liking their individual traits even if they might be a bit shallow, but in some way that docent matter. As the group isn't some big band of superheroes, but instead just a group of kids and teens having fun accidentally stumpeling across a treasure map.If any of us found a treasure map as kids we would go mental, and dive right into the adventure head first without thinking of the consequences. - Just go and have fun - Just like the goonies did.
This is something we all wished happened to us as kids no matter if you grew up in the 80's, 90's, 20's.I can definitely see the charm that the 80's kids would have gotten from the goonies. It's just a pure quirky movie, with funny and dumb jokes, thats great for basically everyone.

A super annoying, pointless mess of pre-teen kids screaming over each other's lines the entire worthless time. It sure AIN'T an exciting comedy adventure. The reason for my bad review? I never watched the film back in the day, so I have no nostalgic reverie for it. The late 70's to mid 80's had the greatest comedy/adventure and adventure films ever made: Indiana Jones, Jaws, Close Encounters, E. T., BIG, Back to the Future(s)! But Goonies doesn't belong on ANY list of fun-film greats. It simply sucked. Pure and simplistically- just like the 'worse than luke warm' adventure plot. Did I mention the non-stop, yelling chatter?

I could show this movie to my audience (boys age 8-14) once a week forever and they would never tire of it. Say this about any other movie, I dare you. Everything about this film, from production values to special effects to sets to music to camera work to editing is A+ and deserves all the accolades it can get. Apparently I need to add lines about the characters to get over the ridiculous minimum requiring padding even if you've said all that needs to be said in a line or two. Sean Astin is cute, asthmatic and vulnerable and will grow up to be a good character actor, and type cast as a Hobbit because he is short. Josh Brolin, Martha Plimpton and Corey Feldman continued on to OK careers as older characters. In short, the whole is much, much more than the sum of its parts and is altogether a work of genius.After another 5 years my opinion has not changed one iota. This is a 10+ fivestar film for the ages; it appeals to kids of all ages and adults also because we (I'm 65) can at least identify with at least one of the weirdo goonies. Forever.",The Goonies

I thought it was okay, but knew it was lacking. I recently saw it again (20 years later), and I know what the problems are. Bad writing, bad acting and bad directing. Everyone yells practically nonstop in the film. You don't believe for a second that any one of these kids is a real person. There's one hint of a decent performance when Sean Astin is recounting the story of One Eyed Willy to his friends in an out of breath monologue. I won't blame the kids, but Spielberg and Donner. Chris Columbus' script felt slapped together in a weekend (probably was under the orders of Spielberg). I have friends who love it, and have fond memories of it as kids, but I guess I've always been overly critical. It's just that I wanted more as a kid. I wanted the same feeling I had when watching Raiders for the first time, or Back To The Future. Those films had something that The Goonies lacked.

178,isaiahwilson15,The archetypal kids adventure movie that shaped the decade and the genre that would follow.,8,12 March 2018,"The Goonies is a movie that's inevitably going to show up on most all lists dealing with films of the 80s. While it does include its fair share of references to a good bit of 80s culture, the biggest draw I found with the movie is in the story. By no means is this a claim to boast it as being the most original story, but the smaller decisions to use a younger cast, focus on a classic pirate storyline, and root it with such relatable dialogue and characters is where the magic happens. 
The Goonies thrives from the kids. The careful casting, writing, and direction that went into making each kid their own special character is what has propelled the movie for decades. The stoic nature of Mikey plays perfectly off the perfectly named Mouth. The inclusion of the gadget based Data gives the movie a nice geeky side, and the cherry on top is in the form of the scene stealing Chunk. Then while the movie makes the smart decision to maintain its focus on the kids, the short fray into the teenagers subplots provides an enjoyable draw for the adolescent age group as well. Parents of today can then turn around and reminisce on the adventurous joys that came with being a kid in the 80s.Unfortunately a common argument that plagues a certain amount of films of every decade, but can stick out at times here is the technical aging of The Goonies. The dialogue dubbing, outdated special effects, and cheesy one liners can be distracting at times. In addition, the teenage subplot while minimal feels very artificial and last minute. However, at the end of the day, The Goonies lighthearted, feel-good story, dialogue, and characters cement it in the Pantheon of 80's Classics!",The Goonies

There is humor for the kids and adults, also it has something that most family films don't, the characters actually are successful and they aren't all happy sappy.While parents might be shocked by the kids behavior (a 14 year old kissed a ten year old by accident OH NO!

Having not witnessed it in a theater in oh, say about fifteen years, I marveled at just how well it retained its 'fun factor'. Like many others, I originally saw ""Goonies"" when I was ten years old. It was a thrill-ride of adventure, jokes, comraderie and sheer 80s icons too numerous to name (the combination of Corey Feldman, Sean Astin, Anne Ramsey, the kid who played Short-Round and a soundtrack featuring Cyndi auper is lethal in its 80s-ness). Seeing it again not only brought back memories, but reminded me of how a good movie can sometimes be the one that is so much fun it masks the absolute absurdity of its plot - something about a group of outcast kids searching for pirate booty to save their neighborhood from greedy developers (like I said, absurd...but so 80s, you know?). Add to the pros of ""Goonies"" its kitschy band of ragtag characters, some of whom stay with you (Sloth, Mouth and the irrepressible Chunk) and some who don't (the older brother, the girls), and you have a movie that stands the test of time, for better or for worse.

This light-hearted swashbuckler/treasure hunt/detective story will bring a sense of nostalgia to anyone.  Mikey (Sean Astin) was my favourite; Although unaware of it, he led the goonies on their adventures.  And I loved the set locations in Astoria and Cannon Beach Oregon.  The Cyndi Lauper song ""Goonies R Good Enough"" wasn't so bad either!  Many kudos to Spielberg & Donner.Although I definitely prefer the widescreen version because of clarity and because it shows more, there are a couple of scenes where matting was used to preserve this aspect (for instance: where the chicken lays the egg in the gate opening scene--the egg is shown dropping into the pan in the full-screen version and cropped out in the widescreen version).",The Goonies

187,Freddy_Levit,Never has a film filled me with as much nostalgia as this magnificent child's fantasy!,10,21 April 2005,"The eighties were above all the greatest decade for imagination. They were the days of more adventure, science fiction and action movies than one could count ants in an ant colony. They were the days when legendary Directors like Spielberg, Lucas, Cameron and Scott dictated movie making and redefined the whole meaning of movie-going. A time when CGI was scarce and unnecessary for make believe, yet where realism was at its peak and brainless audiences didn't require something blowing up every 5 seconds before they lost interest. In other words, it was the decade of wonder and patience. These directors pulled us into their vivid worlds - the worlds we only dreamed about - and we believed and loved every minute of them. Today films are so fast food, I just don't care anymore!It is this why I must write about 'The Goonies' (produced by Spielberg). Is there one guy in the world, born in the 80's, who wasn't affected by the release of this joy of a film? For whoever liked the Indiana Jones trilogy, this was an extension of that vision. It is a roller-coaster ride from start to finish. A pirate treasure story including caverns, mind boggling originality in booby traps, adventurous, inventive and resourceful kids just like Indiana willing to risk their lives for the desirable exotic adventure experience and the biggest and coolest water slide on the face of the Earth. Adventure was every kid's obsession and here is a film realizing that obsession - kids could relate better here than in Indiana Jones due to the leads being your kids next-door kind of 'kids'. This is why many from the eighties consider it their favorite film. This is not to say that this film hasn't got its fair share of obvious flaws, however the story, the acting and directing (as assisted by Spielberg himself) outweighs completely everything else.The story takes place in the coastal US town of 'Astoria', surrounding four friends around the age of 12'ish who call themselves ""The Goonies"" - Goonies being another name for an Albatross of some sort. Composing the gang are 'Mikey', played by Sean Astin (Toy Soldiers), 'Mouth', played by Corey Feldman (Stand By Me), 'Data', played by Jonathan Ke Quan (Indiana Jones and The Temple Of Doom) and 'Chunk', played by Jeff Cohen. Unfortunately for these kids, their friendship and their lives as they know them may be torn apart due to their houses being bought and broken down by a rich, greedy bureaucrat who wishes to build a useless Golf Course on that very same piece of land they live on. To the gang's coincidental surprise, however, whilst sorting through Mikey's dad's attic antiquity they come across a priceless and legendary Pirate Treasure Map. The gang figures if the legend is true and the Treasure is found, they can pay back for the houses their parents couldn't afford to keep. With little interest from the rest of the gang including his own brother, Mikey finally convinces them about the treasure hunt, reminding them of the importance of finding it and regaining their properties. With Mikey's resourceful and smart head, Data's ridiculous yet ingenious inventions, Mouth's unstoppable mouth, and Chunk's ever growling stomach, 'The Goonies' set out on an adventure, who along with Mikey's brother, pick up a few other friends along the way to join them. Unfortunately the clues that lead to the caverns of the lost treasure intersect with wanted thieving criminals known as the 'Fratellis'. However, this is not the only obstacle the Goonies have to conquer - for Spielberg and Richard Donner showcase their highly inventive and famous booby traps that still excite. What follows is the unforgettable pirate adventure story of 'One Eyed Willy'.The acting in this film is flawless. The kids, especially Corey Feldman who has always been a teen actor favorite of mine, had so much enthusiasm in their roles, that you are convinced they are for real. The Fratelli's were funny, but none funnier than 'Data', my personal favorite 'Goonie'. Set Designs were a marvel. Who needs graphics when you're working with Spielberg? The caverns looked so real, like it was an actual place - dusty and dirty and all....Most impressive however was the cinematography and the music, both which establish the atmosphere of the film so vividly and brilliantly. Every time I watch this film, I think of Cindy Lauper's great song. The orchestral music is also wonderful adding an authentic feel of adventure to the surrounding sets. Cinematography was masterfully realized and I loved the beautiful scenery of the coast and the caverns.This great film, although filled with many flaws, is one of my childhood favorites and even in this day and age with the world gone Topsy turvy, I still love this movie to bits - as well as I loved it the first time I saw it. It was directed by Richard Donner, but feels like a Steven Spielberg movie. It has his signature all over the place. I can only summarize this film in one word. It's a 'classic'. A must see for those who are young at heart and who have always had that longing for adventure.",The Goonies

Not to mention we had Ronald Regan as president and pro wrestling was hitting a fever pitch. What a wonderful time to be alive!The Goonies stands the test of time as not only one of the best movies from that period, but perhaps the greatest kid's movie today. If you grew up in the 80's and you are one of maybe 5 people from the United States who have not seen this movie, then due yourself a favor and watch it. You have a quirky, ragtag group of friends that discover a secret treasure map in the attic and embark on one last adventure before their town gets taken over by some corporate big shot and they have to go to separate schools.The emotion this film captures, especially in kids that maybe had to leave friends they grew up with because they were forced to move, is touching. The laughs are plentiful and if you knew a fat kid when you were growing up in the 80's, you likely tried to make them do the ""truffle shuffle"". I also had my daughter for the longest time thinking that the guy who played Sloth looked like that in real life.

192,NxNWRocks,"""This is our time""",7,19 August 2007,"Some films defy true objective criticism since they hold so much affection in the hearts of viewers, and this would be one such movie. The '80s is one of the foremost decades for producing movies that were ""of their time"" and this is no exception. For many, the enchantment is closely tied to nostalgia for their childhood, and it is certainly true that many of the markers in our lifetimes are cultural references.However, as with ""Gremlins""  which is slyly referenced in this movie  nostalgia tends to overlook the technical aspects of film-making. Objectively, ""The Goonies"" does not fare so well. Part of the problem is inherent in most of the cast being young children, and then asking them to all shout or scream loudly at once with their high-pitched voices, and have a murky sound mix try to cleanly catch the dialogue. Another problem is that once the gang set off on their quest down myriad tunnels and caves, with a restaurant fireplace substituting for the rabbit-hole, it is not easy to follow the trail and put together a sense of exactly where they are in each scene and how it ties to where they were in the last one. There are also times when the ""this is our time"" speeches by Sean Astin's character come off as being a little too heavy-handed.Yet another problem is the cutting of a couple of filmed scenes that cause slight disjoints in the narrative. Suddenly the treasure map is significantly damaged without due explanation, and there is a reference to an octopus that is nowhere to be found in the final print. The deleted scenes which explain these plot points are available on DVD.The film could also have used clearer elucidation in other places, including the attic scene in which the map is discovered, and perhaps a word or two of exactly why a pirate ship was off the Oregon coast pursued by the British as soon as the early 1600s. Not that the origin of the back-story makes or breaks this movie, which should be seen first and foremost as pure escapist fantasy. On that basis, the film comes through pretty well, and while it is not a particularly great movie, it does enough to merit the place it has in so many people's hearts.",The Goonies

My kids immediately picked up on the cussing, (I did not remember cussing, but the movie has a lot of cuss words for ""family entertainment""). I myself was shocked by the 2 dimensional stereotypes, obese kid, smart Asian kid, rich jerk kid, obnoxious kid etc. (and I thought politically correct characters are badly written), and the discovery that the humor was sophomoric (dare I say baseless). Even with all that, the movie was still acceptable, until my kids asked to leave, stating they would rather rewatch National Treasure, because the movie was ""boring"" (I must admit the pacing was glacier) and the dialog was ""hard to follow"" (everyone screams over each other).

I was just getting to the age when I had twigged that certain actors, or directors might mean a movie would be better than another.  And one of the names I had grasped was Steven Speilberg. The fact Richard Donner (I also like) actually directed it passed me by at the time, but I think I can put the finger on my disappointment:1. Star Wars and Raiders of the Lost Ark had already fundamentally upped my expectation of what movies could be. 2. Speilberg's Close Encounters, Raiders and ET had all been fantastic 3. I had heard of Gremlims and Jaws but was too young to see them (I know Spielberg didn't direct Gremlins); but heard they were also good (I have a different opinion of Gremlins now...) 4. I think I saw Back to the Future just before I saw Goonies, and I really liked that film - and credited it to Speilberg (again he didn't direct though!) 5. I hadn't heard of 1941... ;-)I was expecting either Fantasy or Sci-Fi, but what I got was a bunch of cardboard cut-out kids going on what appeared to me (as a child) a rather childish adventure (the fantastical element was fairly minimal).  I did like Mikey, I didn't like Mouth (is Corey Feldmans top lip paralysed? it gets on my nerves for no good reason...), I did like Data (hey! I was a kid!), but didn't like Chunk (too stereotypical even for a  kid): result, mixed.Did I like it? Yes, it had lots of good moments, but overall I felt disappointed that there wasn't more to it.Last time I saw it I was about 15 (on video), so my views may be much better now - especially in light of it's cult following, and a number of rave reviews on this board.

In retrospect, this is hardly surprising, considering the multitude of 80's films, both small and big, that have turned into classics. And Goonies exemplifies all the good qualities of the film fare of that time that made them unique. As for me, my story with the Goonies goes back a long time. I first got to see it on VHS in 1988 (apparently I was a little young to catch it in cinemas when it was first screened), instantly loved it and then by a fortunate turn of events I got to own a videotape copy of it. Over the next five years or so, it would be the subject of countless sessions, alone or with friends that got equally infected by the Goonies bug. There where times where I would get to watch it 4 times within the same day. I haven't kept track, but I figure my number of viewings must be approaching triple digits, definitely the one movie I have watched the most times, even though it isn't my favorite. From some point on I got detoxed, but even now I never decline a chance to see it again when it plays on TV. The film has also aged very very well, you can hardly tell it was shot 30 years ago, again, a testament to the production values of that time. Based on an idea by Steven Spielberg at the pinnacle of his creative period and scribed by a then up and coming Chris Columbus (before his mega-successes with Home Alone and the Harry Potter franchise), Goonies is an adventure cleverly employing good old recipes but at the same time infusing them with loads of originality. Lost pirate treasure hunt has never been done with more fun and brio than here. And the movie is also bursting with great humor and immensely quotable lines (a trade that seems to be almost extinct today), thanks to its superbly written script. Richard Donner's direction is top notch and takes full advantage of the terrific ensemble cast of all ages. Almost all of the about a dozen characters are fully fleshed-out and some of them easily turn iconic. Quite a feat for a little children's adventure! And let's not forget Dave Grusin's fabulous score. Or Cyndi Lauper!Above all else, Goonies is a film filled with the children's magic and wonder of the early Spielberg fare, and even if he is not behind the camera this time, his fingerprints on the final product are indelible. It really is a shame that similar movies are hardly made anymore today. Columbus managed to recapture some of the early Spielberg magic with the first of the Harry Potter films, it didn't last long though and wasn't picked up by other directors. I know I would definitely sign up for a new movie of this sort any day, even if I'm not a kid anymore. Sadly, most are now preoccupied with remakes and franchises instead of coming up with original ideas. I hope the Goonies is left untouched by the remake avalanche.",The Goonies

198,outonly,"if you haven't seen this, you've had a deprived childhood",10,19 July 2000,"This is by far the best adventure movie that I have seen, and definitely the best kids movie! I love all the characters, especially chunk and the bad guys! All the dialogue is hilarious, this movie absolutely rules!",The Goonies
199,PhillipMichaelH,If this movie doesn't make you smile then I don't know what does.,10,9 June 2011,"Released in the summer of 1985, The Goonies is the film that I always bring up when I challenge one's coolness. Everyone is entitled to their opinion but what you need to know in order to appreciate this film is that it's purely and simply, a fun adventure film. While yes, the script isn't the most clever ever written, I think that Chris Columbus brings enough character development and well written action scenes along with a lot of heart that makes it a really well laid out screenplay.Steven Spielberg had been in the spotlight for 10 years at this point, thanks to the success of Jaws (1975), Close Encounters Of The Third Kind (1977), Raiders Of The Lost Ark (1981) and most especially, E.T. (1982), which was in its day the highest grossing film in history. All films are absolute perfection in my mind and show us why we go to the movies to begin with. Spielberg was now everywhere and not only the most powerful director in Hollywood but also the most powerful producer. By now, he was even showing his talent as a producer and it was one hit after another. With Poltergiest (1982), Gremlins (1984) and the mega hit Back To The Future (1985), Spielberg could do no wrong and proving that unlike most directors and producers, he clearly knows what the audience wants but also what works and what doesn't.Which brings me to The Goonies. Spielberg originally came up with the story but brought in Gremlins writer and future director Chris Columbus to write the screenplay. He then hired Richard Donner, best known for films like The Omen (1976) and Superman (1978), to direct the film. In my opinion, one of the things that makes this film work so well (besides the script and the actors) is Richard Donner's direction. He brings a sense of excitement and also, tension to the screen. From the very first scene involving a jailbreak, this is a director who knows how to make a movie I think, his camera work and directing of the actors is amazing, it gets you hooked into the story which I have to give credit to Donner. Sometimes I wonder if the movie would have been just as great if Spielberg directed the film himself and don't get me wrong, Spielberg is one of the best directors in my mind but Donner's approach is something to be acknowledged. I actually think it's his film in a way.So yes, I do consider this a cinema classic. It's a film that we can all connect with. I remember one review on IMDb pointing out how this film unifies us and I couldn't have said it any better. Anytime you say The Goonies, people know exactly what you're talking about and they always quote a line from the film. This is the true definition of a cinema classic in my mind, a film that is loved all over the world and it's not just a part of pop culture. I would place this movie up there with Citizen Kane or Casablaca as silly as that may sound to some. If you're a movie lover like me who loves to go to movies to feel uplifted or just have a good time, then this movie is for you.",The Goonies
200,confidencegame,Not recommended for adult first-timers,4,12 November 2017,"Full disclosure: I wasn't a Goonie generation. However, I decided to watch it upon seeing good ratings and plenty of good reviews. The possibility of watching another 80s adventure classic like Stand By Me was highly intriguing...But movie did not live up to those expectations. At all. The beginning was decent enough though, but soon after enormous plot holes and a lot of shouting mixed with unnecessarily loud background music killed my interest. And that's how it remained for the rest of the movie. It made me so puzzled because how can such a movie get such good reviews? I've seen some wonderful movies and series who were bashed big time even though their supposed plot holes were nothing compared to those in Goonies (I mean, how come nobody in 350 years wondered what was at the bottom of that wishing well?!).The only explanation I found is that you can like Goonies only if it was your childhood movie.

Sure, the kids are loud and typiclaly American, but when the adventure starts rolling, it is hard not to enjoy this film. Though Spielberg didn't direct (but produced it), it is a movie that has his autograph all over it.

205,seans_life,The Goonies .... just a nice movie with a few chuckles along the way,10,7 September 2005,"This movie brought back memories of pretending to be this and that as we played in the yard and at the neighbours around our home. We would imagine, pretend and if I was a treasure hunter in some respects I think this movie shows how I would go about doing it ... mistake after mistake I would make but somehow I'd keep my sights on a goal and wouldn't stop til I reached it. Chunk had some funny lines including the one where he was asked to tell everything and he then proceeds to tell the bad guys his whole life story and then tells them the worst thing he did which was to pretend to barf and then he threw fake barf over the railing and it landed on people and it made everyone around that start barfing .... pretty funny life this kid had.It was also interesting to see product placement in the movie as that was not a regular thing back then and only in the last 3 or more years has it become common.I like the Chinese guy's gadgets and how they always seem to be flawed but at different points through the movie he somehow saves them from hurt or death but at the same time causes a few nerve-wrecking moments.Anyway it was a fun movie .... better than what has come out of theaters this Summer of 2005 although Star Wars was pretty good ....",The Goonies

Now I've seen this movie after let's say, 15 years or so and it was one nostalgic treat!

I love the dialogue, the situations, the characters and the music. Donner and Spielberg put a lot of time and energy into this one, and it shows. What makes the film even better, at least for me, are the moments where it alludes to scenes cut from itself (the octopus, Mouth and Stef, etc.).

212,TheRagingBull94,A Film that takes you back to the carefree days of childhood,10,30 May 2011,"The Goonies is a film that I think can be enjoyed by people of all ages, unless you're a pretentious film snob who will dismiss any film that wasn't made by Ingmar Bergman, Federico Fellini, Vittorio De Sica or Stanley Kubrick. The Goonies certainly isn't by any stretch a groundbreaking piece of cinematic history or a masterpiece deemed worthy of mountainous praise, but it is a movie that is cherished by children and adults alike for its simple, but lovable qualities.To keep it brief, the plot follows a group of children living in the Goon Docks suburb who are forced to move away from their homes that they love to make room for the development of a golf course. The children discover an old treasure map that supposedly leads to a fortune in precious stones and jewelery and so they go looking for it to save their homes.A very basic premise, but that isn't the only source of the film's appeal. The characters Mikey, Mouth, Data, Chunk etc are all lovable and are played wonderfully by some of the best child actors ever. Sean Astin (Lord of the Rings) and Corey Feldman (Stand By Me) especially. The other characters are very likable and all deliver great performances In combination with a likable cast of characters and a dire situation, The Goonies has a strong adventurous quality that cannot be easily replicated in a film such as this. The comedic value, although often very cheesy, is very high, notably the antics of Chunk.You'd think that I grew up with this movie considering the positive comments I have about it, but I really didn't. I only saw the film a year ago and instantly fell in love with it. It's a film that perfectly reminds us of the wonders of childhood and why children should appreciate the limited moments they have. It's also a film that manages to cheer me up regardless of how upset I may feel. Because of this, The Goonies demands infinite rewatches.It does sadden me that my parents never exposed me to The Goonies as a child, but I know that after experiencing it again and again, I will not make the same mistake and I sincerely hope that after reading my review that you will do the same. The creative minds of both Richard Donner (Lethal Weapon, Superman, The Omen) and Steven Spielberg (Jaws, Raiders of the Lost Ark, Schindler's List) should be praised.The Goonies is a film that takes you out of a complicated world, spiritually transports you back to childhood and entertains you marvelously from the opening scene to the end credits. I love this movie and if you're willing to lighten up, I'm sure you will too. Thank you for reading my review.10/10",The Goonies
213,sabalo,best kids film ever!,10,2 November 2003,"Every child dreams of finding treasure and in the Goonies they showed how a group of kids gets to actually do this. So many films aimed at kids are too cutesy and gloss over the more serious points in life. This film doesn't and has a realistic feel to it, maybe not in the actual events portrayed but in the feelings of the children in facing a family crisisWhen I was a kid this film scared me pretty good and its not silly like Scooby Doo or tosh like Inspector Gadget. More like Indiana Jones or Star wars. I'm 28 and I don't care who knows I still watch it!!!I thought the acting was good considering some of the complicated lines, Chunk I found very funny and he has some classic scenes in the film. The stereotypes are fun and are not done in a negative way, the bad guys are truly bad and played without overdoing the humour - we can still laugh at them and be frightened without going too far either wayI think this was destined to be a cult film because its not one of those forgettable easy to market films, the effort went into the script and the story telling instead. Theres not even any real hero's, just a bunch of everyday kids doing cool stuffI would recommend this film to anyone with children who don't get scared too easily and every adult, don't be boring and have some fun!Major Spoiler: I always noticed how they didn't get to keep all the treasure in the end, only a few jewels.

Everything that repels me about Spielberg is in this repugnant waste of celluloid - the cutesy sentimentalised, middle-American vision of childhood, the corny ""humour"", the utter predictability, but more than anything the incessant screaming and shrieking by the fat-faced,horrid,horrid little kids,who,in a more enlightened age would've been slaughtered at birth.

They never shut up for a moment in most of the scenes. Donner's ""don't tell it, yell it!"" direction makes for a fingernail's down the blackboard effect. The fat little kid, for whom there are not enough meals in the day, is particularly annoying - also because there isn't much funny about obesity, particularly in a 10 yr. old.

224,prfrmr,"A must-see for any childhood reminisce, full of pirate adventure and friendships",10,21 October 2006,"I remember fully when this movie came out. This was when Widescreen was a brand new cinematic invention, and we thought it was way cool to see this movie being shown of such surround screen magnitude in a theater that for our time (the 80's) was known as ""upgrading"". The sound quality had much improved, thanks in part to LucasFilm studios, and the cinema scope (modernized for 21st Century) difference was incredibly awesome. We sat in the theaters, completely mesmerized by all the special effects, sound, and camera takes that previous teen films really didn't offer too much of. And the incredible 'water slide' scene towards the ending, alongside that magnificent pirate ship, sent shivers down everyone's spine, with incredible tingling sensations. We were all still commenting about the incredible experience, many years later.This film touches me in so many emotional ways, embellishing from back in my childhood:: Here we have a group of misfit kids, who call themselves the ""Goonies"", being they live in a historical old section of a seaside village the wealthy yucks want to selfishly demolish in order to build a fancy golf course, with no recognition or acknowledgment of the residents' place, considering the area the ""slums"" or ""goon-docks"" (moderning,'back woods hillbilly-types') as they are thought of the ""lesser"" people's. Saddened and deeply troubled by the assumed outcome, brother's Brand and Mikey bond together, and try desperately to think of some way they can possibly help their working-class parents, along with the rest of the working-class neighborhood parents, keep the village free from the greedy hands of the developers. If only money was not the sleazy issue. As the story continues, along comes Mikey's small group of closest pals, nicknamed Mouth, Data, and Chunk, who fully understand their pals' plight. And humorously, bend to the affections of Brand (who inadvertently cannot take the boys anywhere, being he 'flunked' his driver's test), with methodical teasing the inability to cruise the town, etc. (mainly Mouth's comments). In order to ease the tension, sadness and pain, the boys farewell takes them into Mikey's attic, where a sudden turn of events brings them upon an old pirate treasure map. Of course at first the kids are skeptical, considering it just a piece of dad's untouched, stored antique collection, until one of the boys remembers rumors of an old legend of the village, of pirate adventure. Mikey is at first the only one who takes the legend seriously, and pockets an old Chalst found inside the map. Soon after, he convinces his pals to go searching for this buried treasure, because ""what if""??? If there is indeed a secret buried treasure out there, then they already have the map to go find it, ease the boredom, do something exciting and adventurous for a change, and not continue moping around the house, feeling sorry. Alas, Mikey and friends go treasure hunting, only to run into the infamous Fratelli clan, notorious bank robbers on the loose, but then manage to escape, and continue embarking on their treasure-hunting journey towards the riches each of them only ever dreamed of. The Fratelli's get hot on their tale, once they find out about the map too...Then meet Sloth, the kindly 'Giant' who gets befriended by Chunk (whom the Fratelli's take hostage), then escapes, and goes searching after the friends. Throughout all the special effects, the Indiana Jones-like adventure, and musical score, next up we get first-hand at the camera-revealing pirate mystery, as the incredible buried ""lost"" ship is finally revealed in all its resplendent glory. The Frateli's eventually catch up with the ""Goonies"", threatening to defeat their riches pursuit, but are then taken down by Sloth and Chunk. The Goonies escape from the hidden cave, but not without sobby farewells....as the cave starts to unravel...Here come the Press and the worried folks, at the end, the kids getting their moments of news fame as the Fratelli's are finally apprehended. Then the climactic moment, while the Press is interviewing everybody....a secret legend is finally revealed a historical fact. ""Holy Mary, mother of God..."" the officer rasps. The pirate ship is seen, finally escaping its 300 year imprisonment, as the kids and Sloth watch it sail away...in the sunset.

235,mistertcj,"Purely For The Nostalgists Among You, I Think.",3,23 February 2019,"Simply because of the amount of films that I watch, I do not write that many reviews. However, being a 50 something, watching 'The Goonies' for the first time, I just felt that I had to write one on this occasion.My wife bought me one of those 'bucket list' scratch off posters for Christmas. A list of 100 films (104 including a couple of trilogies) to watch and I decided to start from scratch (pun not intended) and watch again, any that I had already seen.I had, of course, heard of 'The Goonies' before obtaining the poster, and had seen the copious amounts of favourable reviews. It is undeniably regarded as a cult classic. I know that a lot of you will undoubtably disagree with what I have to say, but goodness me, I cannot remember the last time that I was so disappointed when watching something that has been classed as a cinematic masterpiece.Many people have already said that if you are over a certain age and are watching this for the first time.....it might actually not be a good idea. Well, I watched this with my 15 year old son and, I have to say that he wasn't particularly enamoured with it either. With the pedigree of Richard Donner, Chris Columbus and Steven Spielberg, this could have and should have been so much better.My main gripe with the movie is the SHOUTING!!! After about 20-25 minutes, I was already fed up with it, but I stuck through it and watched it all. Yes, children shouting unintelligibly, and over each other, is excessively annoying, but the adults (to a lesser degree) were also doing it. Having said that, the adult characters were childlike anyway. The chief protagonist in the SHOUTING stakes was Chunk (Jeff Cohen).......quite simply one of the worst characters (if not THE worst) I have ever come across in a mainstream movie. He should have been left in the cave. Other main shouters were Data (Ke Huy Quan), Andy (Kerri Green) Mama Fratelli (Anne Ramsay) Francis (the usually excellent Joe Pantoliano) and Mikey (the main character...Sean Astin). Now when the main character has to shout just to calm the others down, it doesn't bode well.Sean Astin is actually very good, as is Josh Brolin. So you can see why they went on to appear in bigger and better things. Corey Feldman's character was remarkably understated compared to most of the others...and a pleasant surprise.Due to what I have already said, the plot unfortunately, became almost secondary. Yes, it is pretty lame if I'm honest, but could have been so much better. To think that a massive pirate ship and its treasure could have been laying undiscovered, where is was, is unthinkable (is that a plot spoiler?). Yes, I know the film is for kids, but I'm pretty sure that even the majority of them would think 'hang on a minute!' Sure the 5-10 year olds out there would probably be happy but you have to realise that the main children in this film are actually 12-15 years old, and therefore, the ages of the kids that it should be directed at.As I said earlier, I have seen many people saying that adults shouldn't be watching this for the first time. That can be said of many other films, all of which I have enjoyed. This though, has to be one of the excruciatingly annoying movies that I have ever seen.So why have I not given it 1 star you might ask? Reasons......it could quite easily have been better. It started well (shouting aside). And oh.....I loved Sloth!",The Goonies
236,sweetartcat,Idiotic,1,18 October 2009,"Where's my aspirin? After watching this I have a headache. I must be one of the only people in the world who dislike this movie. Granted, I did not see it as a kid. As an adult, I found it obnoxious beyond belief mostly because of all the constant chatter and screaming. ""Ahhhhhh"" throughout the movie made me spend a lot of time fast forwarding. The stereotyping was beyond annoying; this is the kind of movie that gives kids permission to think its OK to be annoying and behave like dodos. Yes, I know it was a spoof, but it was still too moronic and sophomoric for my tastes.The script jumped around and didn't make sense in many places. And tell me why anyone would believe they were building a golf course in the hills of Astoria Oregon. The main house sits on a hill unsuitable for a golf course. We must have had a lot more tolerance for bad scripts in the 80's. I've seen a variety of 80's movies which had awful scripts and were nominated for Oscars.The Spiderwick Chronicals are 100% better.

237,Mer_Girl_Fits_Heaven,Keeps Me Young,8,22 November 2008,"The Goonies is a great film for kids. It's basically ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" for children, every bit as hilarious and exciting. It's the story of a group of friends (and potential girlfriends) who go searching for pirates treasure in the hopes that they can save their homes from foreclosure in the process. They come into contact with a family of thieves and a disfigured but utterly lovable ""Sloth"", along with a host of boobie traps that are so wonderfully simple, the spectacular events on screen seem really possible in real life.Another great thing about the Goonies is that it has a character for every personality type. THere's the cheerleader, the fat kid, the arrogant but witty best friend,the genius, and the idealistic dreamer. In short, there's a character in this movie for every kid to relate to.Unfortunately, I have heard that if you didn't see this movie as a child, it has substantially less value as an adult. Therefore, buy it for your kids (they'll treasure it forever), and rent it for yourself (just so you know what all the fuss is about)",The Goonies

I have never seen or rented a movie more than this one and everyone i have talked to about this movie agreed with me that it was one of the best films ever made because there was no other film like it. Sure it didnt have the greatest effects nor the greatest actors nor the greatest music but who says you need great anything to make a great movie. This is the most highly recommended movie. If you havent seen this movie than youre missing out(either that or youre a rock). I enjoy it more and more each time i see it.

239,fushnicken69,Slick Shoes!,9,6 September 2001,"The Goonies was one of the first movies my parents took me to go see when I was a little one. In fact, it was third behind Return of the Jedi and The Karate Kid. Since I was only 5 at the time, there are scant images remaining from that first showing. One being my Dad laughing his ass off during the interrogation scene between Chunk and the Fratelli's and a poster for Psycho II out in the lobby. It wasn't until this film came to video that I started fiending for it like a speedfreak on pay day.From a one year period between 1987 and 1988 I must have seen this movie at least 2-3 times a week. I knew every line by heart and I even went out and bought as many packs of the Goonies Trading Cards I could get my grubby little hands on. I always kept on getting the card where they get attacked by the octopus. This always p***ed me off because there was never any scene with the octopus in any frame that I ever saw. I must have seen the flick about 75 times by then and still no frickin' octopus. Damn Richard Donner and his scissor happy editing.Anyway, by the time I got to third grade I was so burned out on the movie that I refused to watch it for over ten years. But when I did finally see it again, the magic was still there. This has to rank as one of the best kid flicks of all time. I say that because it doesn't tone down on the swearing content. Some parents would argue with me on that point but it's time to face the truth. Unless you haven't been to a school playground since 1965, you know that little kids are capable of saying stuff that would make a Hells Angel blush. It's a kid flick for real kids.And what the hell ever happend to Chunk? I know Mikey went on to become Rudy and he's gonna be in Lord of the Rings, Brand is now engaged to Minnie Driver, Martha Plimpton does mostly stage stuff, and Corey Feldman is...well...Corey Feldman. But Chunk fell off the face of the Earth. I thought that was him as the guy at the motel front desk in Memento but it turned out that it wasn't. Somebody help me find Chunk!",The Goonies

They find a map in one of the kids attics and a hilarious and touching adventure follows, with an idiotic gangster family and dead pirates somehow in the middle of it all.One of my favourite characters is Mouth, one of The Goonies who as his name may suggest lets his mouth run away with him and lets slip some very funny bloopers.But the best character is Chuck an accident prone tail spinner who can eat anyone out of house and home. The truffle shuffle scene was one of the greatest scenes in cinema history ( I can do the truffle shuffle but choose not to). The scene with the blender was also hilarious.Sloth and his wiggling ears are also legendary.

I never saw this movie as a kid. I just saw it recently for the first time ever, and it wasn't the best childhood film ever-- sorry! I can't believe this movie is rated PG, it has some bad crudeness for a PG. But good points of the film I liked is the (slightly random) adventure and the development of the gaggle of kids, who are NOT perfect angels (if you thought that), none the less maybe that's why they are called the Goonies.PLOT: On verge of being kicked out of their neighborhood, a rag-tag group of kids randomly find a treasure map in their attic (I guess that's childhood-dreamish). But around that time a tedious family of criminal have their hearts set on the treasure too (oh joy). They set out for their excursion hoping to find riches so that they can pay the financier allowing them to say in their neighborhood. Soon, 3 teens join them as they delve deeper following the map while escaping the petty criminals. It actually has sorta an exciting atmosphere to it.CHARACTERS: Mikey,the protagonist is childish, simply and likable. His weird dialogue towards 1-eyed Willy really erked me. He's sorta clean. Data I liked, he was clever and funny, very clean most of the time. Mouth was kinda annoying but kinda sincere, but like a annoying toughboy. Chunk, he grew on me-- though I didn't like his use of profanity in his 1st scene. The infamous truffle-shuffle (I don't get th name) was kinda sad and pointless, many people said it was offensive to over-weight people (it gotta agree) but I guess it was used to force laughter out of children (I didn't laugh). I still just kinda liked Chunk though, he was pathetic and fun. Brand was nice (to his bro, that scene was good) and intelligent but his tough-guy rendo was typical and idiotic, his love interest with Andy grossed my out (she looked young). Andy herself was cute and smart, but her use as the sensual object erked me-- she was just a young girl, let her be one. Stef, I really liked her. She was awesome, with her geek's getup, she rocked! She was calm, pure, caring, passionate and panicked very little. Sloth scared me most of the time (always smiling) but he served well. The Fretelli were petty and demented-- singing spontaneously, trying to kill kids, and ultimately dull as hey were used as comical villains. That Mama Fretalli was wicked, not scary just sadistic. I felt sorry for the kind Roselita, a Latina housekeeper. I hated how Mouth made fun of her.The acting just about good enough, but still the kids seemed fake, being in a shallow cave with horrific booby-traps they should have been out their minds scared making it realistic, but it's a kid film (still can't believe it though). At least the kids had fun doing the movie.One scene in Mikey's house is the crudest, sexually horrible, unhumourous and unneeded. The kids cussing makes them lose innocence fast. Mikey's mom looks like she takes horrible care of her kids. There's a horrible scene where the younger kids bribe each other with porn (not a magazine fortunately, just something lesser). There's a gross scene with these men at the showers (upper torsos shown, fortunately) and a disgusting scene with a man at the restroom.In the end, everything gross ruins the film.

This could only be accomplished with the boyhood fantasy of wanting to discover buried treasure.  Who hasn't seen this movie ten times?

253,fishpoo,For the child minded only,6,7 March 2003,"A friend of mine told me about this film a few days ago. I thought it sounded kind of childish. But because I know some of the actors and Spielberg produced it, I watched it. My friend told me it was a bit like Indiana Jones, so I was expecting a mixture of Spy Kids and Indie, which could be quiet good. But this was not the case.The film starts with some rather childish jokes, but I thought to myself, that this is a children's film. But then people started swearing and talking about drugs and sex, nothing too serious, but I wasn't expecting the `S' word. This made be wonder what the target age group for this film was. Of course there could also be censored versions of this film, but the one I saw was not.One of the children is Jonathan Ke Quan, who played a very similar part in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. I found his Goonies Character extremely annoying. He has these gadgets, like a boxing glove on a spring attached to his chest, which seemed kind of stupid to me. If you find jokes like this funny then you may enjoy this film. If not, you probably shouldn't watch it.The film starts of rather quickly and the bad guys are soon introduced. One of them is Joe Pantoliano, from The Matrix and Memento. I liked his character in The Matrix and Memento, he seemed kind of smart and made a good bad guy. I thought he might be the same in The Goonies. No such luck, in the Gonnies he plays a really stupid bad guy with a wig that drops of, he reminded me of Daniel Stern in the Home Alone movies.The Story, which is by Spielberg who doesn't do that much writing, could have been better. It didn't seem interesting enough. And not that much really happens in Chris Columbuses Screenplay. I can't really remember much of the middle of the film, which normally means I either fell a sleep or I got really bored and started daydreaming. I had this problem with Gangs Of New York.At the end of the film, I felt that Sean Astin's character, Mikey should have been more developed. The story seemed to be mainly about him, but he didn't really have many lines. I suppose a child wouldn't really be bothered by this much. But a good children's film should be suitable for older people too. Or it wouldn't really be a Family Movie.I can't think of anything good to say about this movie, I didn't like it much.

Those of us who, like Spielberg, grew up in the 50's with TV's version of ""Our Gang"" in the form of daily episodes of ""The Little Rascals"", quickly recognize in ""The Goonies"" Spanky McFarland's adventure as portrayed in the Little Rascal's ""Night n' Gales"" (1937). In that adventure, Spanky, Alfalfa and the gang are caught in a storm and must spend the night at Darla's house. There is much ado about the gang sharing a bed with Darla's father, skillfully played by Johnny Arthur, and after some comic bits, the boys fall asleep and dream about, what else but, pirates' treasure. The dream scene that follows with the Rascals finding a pirate ship and chests of gold and jewels and a giant pirate who protects it all lends itself beautifully to Spielberg's skillful rendering of the Goonies in discovering the treasure of John' Matuszak's Sloth. The squeals and screams of fear and the visual muggings of the Goonies as Sloth chases them are not just reminiscent, but rather they are identical to Hal Roach's scenes in which the Rascals are chased by the angry giant. Of course, this is where the similarities begin and end, as ""The Goonies"" grow beyond the fantasy dream world mischievousness of the Rascals and develop into a full-scale celluloid study of a group of prepubescent misfits growing up in an adult world that is seriously tainted with an inability to dream, to wonder, and to create the child's world of unlimited adventure.",The Goonies

Isn't it everyone's dream to find a treasure map?  Have a moment as Indiana Jones?  When you are a kid you want all of multiplied by about a 1,000, that is this movie.This movie has it all:  family stress that the kids understand, funny moments, mystery, bad guys, action, adventure, 80's music, pirates.  Best of all real sets!!  A couple of bad blue screen shots and some other mistakes that can easily be over looked.DVD has a great commentary from the actors about 15 years after the film was made.  Good to see them grown up and hear what it was like as they look back.  They seemed to have fun pointing out mistakes, some of which I hadn't even noticed.If you grew up in the 80's and missed this movie run to your video store and check this out.",The Goonies

I just bought the film recently and there are scenes in that that they hadn't shown before (to my delight). This is probably the best family movie there is!Data is also one of my favourite characters and Mouth and well...I like them all!!!,The Goonies

264,foojones,"Great 80s Flick, Though the New Generation Might Have Trouble Watching",10,28 October 2015,"I loved The Goonies growing up. There was something about small town living and that 80s charm that you couldn't get enough of. It was an innocent time, and in this generation, I'm not even sure if kids have any kind of crazy adventures with all of their iPads and everything else.The 80s were a great time to be a kid, and this movie definitely shows that. It was a time when kids just got together to go have fun, and possibly cause mischief. In this case here, it's to stop evil bad guys from hurting them and saving their homes from foreclosure and having to move away.Watching this movie now does bring back some serious nostalgia, even if a lot of the dialogue is really cheesy. ;) Perhaps the best aspect of this film is the adventure tied to it. Watching a bunch of kids overcome obstacles that stumped adults and the hilarity that comes with trying to outwit their nitwit enemies, the Fratellis, makes for a silly and entertaining adventure! Kids of today might not be able to get into this, but if you have kids that are still young enough that they just enjoying watching a movie with you, this is still great family fun.",The Goonies
265,OllyBishop,One of the most life-shaping movies ever.,10,24 February 2003,"This is an outstanding kids movie which has transcended film and and made a life of its own in the hearts of millions of kids that grew up in the eighties, myself one of them. Centering around a group of kids on the search for treasure to save their community, it manages to conjure up amazing feelings of youth and adventure when watched in hindsight, especially if you ever wanted to be 'Mikey' or 'Data' or 'Mouth' while playing with your childhood friends. I saw it recently at the cinema for the first time, after years of watching it on TV and video, with about 500 other like minded people my age who all had the same feelings i did. Although the print was pretty bad is was still the greatest cinema experience of my life. Admittedly, if you hadn't grown up with the film and all the things that go with it, then you might not love it as much watching it for the first time as an adult. But if you ever had a BMX, a tree house, or a NES, then you are in for a treat.A rumored sequel could be on the way, and although fans have reservations about it's faithfulness to the original, i know most couldn't resist another trip to Astoria. 10/10.",The Goonies

This movie will always hold that special place in my heart and in my collection of films. The Goonies defined my childhood, watched it for he first time as a kid and immediately wanted to be a Goonie :-) It had the same impact as Indy did on me, gave me the lust for adventure and action! It has great directors, great producers and great actors who just fit the bill perfectly. It's hard to pick a favourite character because they're all good but the 2 that crack me up most times I watch it are the Fratelli brothers! Very funny bumbling idiots who get bullied by their mum lol. Overall this movie is an all time classic and will stay that way through the generations in my opinion. If you have never seen it, treat yourself to a gem, I hope you won't be disappointed :-)",The Goonies

The film has lots of comedy moments as well as the love shared between friends. The Goonies is a classic film that has stood the test of time, and no matter how old you get and how many times you have seen this film you never get sick of it. It has a treasure hunt, pirates, and villains. The cast are brilliant and the storyline fantastic. We all wanted to be Goonies and I personally still do, it should remain as one of the most successful 80's movies ever, a classic in its own right. And deserves its place as one of the top family movies.",The Goonies
272,DanceInTheGutter,A wonderful film with enough adventure for the whole family...,10,28 April 2008,"I remember lazy weekend days watching this flick with my sister and cousins, laughing and repeating our favorite quotes out loud. And then, after our imaginations had been fueled, it was off to find a treasure map of our own.This movie is a classic. Bottom line. I have seen it more times then I can count, and it never gets old, even as I do. It's great to watch alone, but even better with friends or family. When the day comes that I have children, this will be one of the films I make sure they watch.The cast is excellent, and all the characters are quirky and fun. It's not scary (so don't be worried to show it to around 5 and up), though they do say 'crap'(and I think some other soft 'naughty' words), don't know how many parents would be upset about this...If you love adventures that seem possible, and yet just out of reach, this is for you. But, remember, this is an older movie. Don't expect dazzling effects. Generations right after mine have been spoiled by high-tech, flashy works that lack decent plot. Watch for the fun, not to be overly impressed by 3D awesomeness, or anything like that.One of my best loved childhood memories. Must watch!",The Goonies

I hadn't sat and watched it for over 10 years, plus i hadn't shown my daughter it. Being 4 1/2 i wasn't sure if it would keep her attention. However, she instantly got into it. I can remember my parents desperately scraping around for a VHS to record it from the television and yet here i was sitting with my child watching it. I didn't see that coming.

275,MCMLXXVI,A childhood film that survives the ravages of time,8,23 July 2005,"I was reminded of this film when there was a reference to it in a recent episode of Family Guy. I thought I would put my fond memories of the film to the test (a dangerous thing to do usually) and go out and hire it. I was pleasantly surprised to find that this film manages to be entertaining two decades later.For those of you that haven't seen it, I'm not sure if I can promise a great movie experience, because I know much of my enjoyment of this film is connected to fond memories of my original (multiple) viewings way back when. But I would like to think that it is still a decent film for kids and young teens, and it goes without saying that for those of you reading this who are thinking about watching it again after many years distant from the last time, I highly recommend a revisiting of this film.This film is a fairly straightforward adventure movie, but very well done, and the feeling of empathy one has for the main characters is the thing that carries the viewer to the end. Twenty years is long enough for subtle but meaningful shifts in the cultural values of a society, and I did cringe slightly at times, but that is to be expected and not an indictment on the film.",The Goonies
276,Extremesplash,Best movie of my childhood,8,25 February 2008,"I hadn't watched the Goonies in years, in fact I first saw it in 1987 on our new VCR and watched it over and over, but anyway it had been about 10 years since I last saw it. I came home from a long Saturday night and it happened to be on. As I was watching all the nostalgia came rushing back to me(about where Cyndi Lauper starts singing ""Goonies R Good Enough""). What a great movie, you will never see something like this made today, it had some mature themes(although nothing really that bad) and kids were allowed to be kids back then. What's great about it is that the kids are real, swearing and all, and are not being tracked on GPS like many kids of today. Some people complain about the acting and the dialogue, but what are people expecting from a movie targeted towards children and preteens? The main attraction in movie's like this is the adventure, and with a man like Spielberg behind it, the adventure sure didn't disappoint. Adding the production values of a summer blockbuster adventure to a children's movie was pure genius. Anyone who can't appreciate this movie was probably forced against their will to do the ""Truffle Shuffle"" when they were younger.",The Goonies

I fell in love with it as a young kid the first time I watched it on television with my younger sister.The cast works perfectly for this story, the comedy is top notch and appeal lasts forever. One of the best things about the Goonies is so many of us have become a ""Goonie"". I myself use the name in most of my monikers including for these reviews here at IMDb.With the advancement of film making capabilities The Goonies is starting to look dated, but I still enjoy every minute of it.

The story of a motley crew of kids searching for treasure to save their town is just so enthralling. I love all the characters. They all have a memorable characteristic and a quotable line. I love that the villain is a scary old lady and her mama's boy sons. The acting is great, the picked the cream of the crop in child stars. I love the Babyruth part, and when mama Fertteli pulls the pearls out of mouths mouth! Also the kissing scene is priceless. I think this is a movie everyone should see.

It's hardly bearable. Really. There is almost not a single minute of normal volume talking in this movie. Screaming, shouting, screaming from beginning to the end.They have a cool adventure and the story is funny enough for children and some adults. This is why I give 5 stars and not 2.The music is terrible too. Slapstick Sound effects in some situation make it even worse.When this was released it might have been cool and appropriate and especially children don't care so much about the screaming, so this made it great for many who today still like the film because of their children-bias.But really, seen from the eyes of an adult, today in 2014? 5 Stars at best.",The Goonies

This film is the reason I have loved movies. It is part of my childhood. And provides adventure, imagination,mystery,thrills,humor and action.From the opening scene we are introduced to the gang and the villains. The Score is mysterious and magical and is absolutely magnetic. The locations are superbly beautiful. ECola park is a location I have to see some time in my life. The cinematography is majestic most notably in the end showing the ship sailing away. Which gives me goosebumps all the time. The sets are just amazing. The set designers and production designers showed the adventure we want to be a part of. The Waterslides that shoot out the protagonists to the cave filled with an aroma of water which holds One Eyed Willies ship is a spectacular moment. One I have enjoyed a lot.The direction is handled perfectly by Donner. The film also has that essence of Spielberg due to the man himself. Without him this would not have been as good. Chris Columbus, I feel is very underrated and has created a magical script filled with beloved characters which are portrayed superbly.This film is fantastic. I recommend you go watch it. It will please the kid inside you and have a great adventure. One you can enjoy moment after moment. Just make sure you do the Truffle Shuffle after.",The Goonies

I could sit and tell you each line and what is going to happen next. This movie is a classic from the 80s and a good memory from my childhood. ""This is our time"" and ""Hey, you guys!"" are favorite lines. The Goonies is a good conversationalist piece because people remember it and love it. It has a good story and not bad acting. Sean Astin is a cutie in this movie. We all know that we had friends that we did crazy things with when we were kids. This movie just lets us remember them (well not looking for treasure, but something close).",The Goonies
288,timidfreda,I Even Liked the Villans!,10,21 December 2002,"This is such an entertaining film. The kids (who today, are no longer kids)really held it together. Sean Astin as the pubescent, not so healthy dreamer who fills his friends with hope, and Josh Brolin as his older brother, handsome even at that age, leading their friends in the quest of their young lives...to save their homes from the <obligatory and hateful> land baron and his vapid son. But the villans, especially Robert Davi as Jake Fratelli, keep this movie moving along. Mama Fratelli (Anne Ramsey), evil and partial to her son, Francis (Joe Pantoliano)growls and sputters delightfully. Robert Davi, however, crooning Italian opera, made the biggest impression on me. This movie made me a big fan. His delivery, presence and comic badness coupled with that incredible singing voice and unforgetable face keeps me looking for his name in newly released films. Goonies was a wonderful introduction to Mr. Davi and, since Profiler is in reruns, I hope to see him in more featured roles.",The Goonies

I am so happy that this film has not only touched me, but many people the world over. This film is probably the most important film of my childhood. I can remember many a rainy day where my Dad would take me to the local video store to hire a film and we I would always pick up the same video.....The Goonies. After 12 years things don't change. It still rains in England, and I still watch The Goonies on a regular basis. Didn't we all at one time, wish that we were a Goonie huh? I personally always wanted to be Mikey, leading the gang to ""One Eyed Willy"". It's that kind of interaction that is missing from films today. I just hope that the good people at Warner Brothers and Amblin Entertainment deside to release it on DVD. This film deserves to be dusted and polished digitally so that future generations of young kids can enjoy it as much as I have. Whoever you are young or old and haven't so already, I strongly suggest that you watch The Goonies. I hope it touches you as much as me. With rumors of a script going around Hollywood to do a sequel, now is an excellent time to catch the original and see why it is worth a sequal!

The film was fantastic, it brought back so many memories of my childhood and Chunk was so familiar to me that I could have sworn that it was a take off of me. I bought this film on video and still watch it every couple of months or so. If you have a child whinging at home and go and hire out the Goonies and sit back and watch it with the kids.

That annoying staccato-strings and the cello trills splashed all over the place when something's supposed to be cutesy-funny. Oh the cringing right from the get go.That unbelievably annoying Asian kid from Indiana Jones (Mr Jones! Mr. Jones!). Oh no. Oh no.Back to the cutesy-funny. That's all this movie is - attempts at this type of entertainment that just fall flat.I could go on, but man I just hated this film.

I remember seeing it for the first time at my cousin's house on T.V. when we were eight. Then, it was just a funny movie that had a funny fat kid, some other funny kids, and a funny-looking guy who yelled funny stuff. Now, it's definitely the best.It's about 4 boys (Mikey, [who was always my favorite,] Data, Mouth, and Chunk) who are about to be separated because their housing development is going to be torn down to make room for a snotty country club golf course (headed by none other than the boys' least favorite person's father)The boys go up in the attic and find a treasure map. Thinking that they might be able to find the treasure and be able to ""save to goon docks,"" they set off on what will be the biggest Goonie adventure they've ever done!It's rated PG, although there's an awful lot of swearing. No ""f-words"", but they say ""shit"" about every other sentance, and ""damn"" occasionally, so if you're gonna watch this with younger kids, think about it first. In all, I rate it a definite 10, for hilarious mishaps, fun quotes, great fun, and 'the funny fat kid'. :) (It's in English, by the way.)""...con las cucarachas, por DOS semanas, sin agua y sin comeda!"" - Mouth, in the ""Translate into Spanish for Rosalita"" scene",The Goonies

The best part of the film for me is any scene with sloth! He is a true screen king!

The scene with Rosita wasn't racist in any way, just funny.Goonies is a 80's throwback movie that became one of the kids hits of the decade (along with Back to the Future, Teenwolf and the two Star Wars sequels) It tells of a group of kids who find a treasure map and embark on a two hour thrill to recover the lost treasure of One-Eyed Willy.Amusing, great characters and superb script probably sums it up the best and I urge you all to watch the movie, show your kids and your kids kids - to the rest of you who are taking the film far too seriously - get a life, get an imagination, and get out more....",The Goonies

fighting the enemies among the Knights of the Round Table. Just like in
the
Fantasy Island, where Mr. Roarke and Tatoo would make all one's wishes
come
true, The Goonies has the special talent to bring our childhood fantasies
back and remind us how great those years were.In this 1985 movie, a bunch of kids find a map which indicates the spot
where the evil pirate One-Eyed-Willie buried a big treasure stolen from
English ships in the 1500's. As we can predict, they decide to seek for
the
gold and precious stones to help their parents who are about to be
expelled
from their homes because they can't make ends meet and also because some
wealthy men want to put their houses down to build a country club on it's
place. Dangers, traps and even a family of thieves - the Fratelli - are
after them.As the film goes on, we can see how closer the friends get and how
supportive we all should be. They would always be there for each other, no
matter how deep their problems are. Even a rich girl, Andy, is accepted by
the group, in a very politically correct act, where no distinctions are
made. The scene in which the guys are stuck in a hole, is very touching
and
really digs our sense of aid.Richard Donner directed this movie and another famous director, Chris
Columbus wrote the screenplay, based on a Steven Spielberg's story. Matt
Sweeney was responsable for the special effects and the main theme ( They
'r
good enough ) was written and performed by Cindy Lauper.After the film, none of the kids became famous actors. Corey Feldman and
Kerry Green took part in some teenage comedies, while Sean Astin showed up
in ""Memphis Belle"" and Ke Huy Quan was the young Indiana Jone's chinese
taxi
driver in ""The Temple of the Doom"". The only one who joined some serious
projects was Martha Plimpton.But these are just technical details. What really counts in ""The Goonies""
are the two hours of humanity, pleasure, inocence, friendship - and even
the
first love - that only children can show in their eyes. In fact, it's a
small journey to our past, to a time when your deepest worries were about
the girl (or the boy) on the next chair.",The Goonies

303,manydahipy,The greatest comedy film ever made!,10,10 September 2001,"Simply put, this is the greatest movie of the 80s.  No question.  What more can you ask for than a movie that has chunk do the truffle shuffle?  More quoteables than you could ever want from a movie!  ""Rocky road?"", ""First you gotta do the truffle shuffle"", ""jerk alert"". The DVD is highly recommended as the entire 7 goonies come back to do audio commentary and reveal cool details.  If you haven't seen this movie buy it!!!! It will soon be your favorite.  It is the funniest movie ever made.  With the best child actors ever assembled in one movie.

305,jon-1086,Part of growring up in the 80's,10,20 April 2008,"I just watched this film for at least the 5th time and it is just a great, funny bit of escapism. It takes me right back to being a kid in the 80's, and almost anyone who grew up then who by some weird twist of fate hasn't seen this should watch it immediately.There is some great comic acting. I don't know why Corey Feldman hasn't done more - his performance as the wisecracking Mouth really stands out. The scene at the beginning where he shows the maid around the house still makes me laugh.This is a kids film I am absolutely 100% unashamed to enjoy at the age of 32. If I have kids, I can't wait to watch it with them.Hollywood gets a lot of stick for churning out dumb movies these days, and it hasn't made family entertainment likes this for a long time.

I was too young to see it when it was first released, but i have watched countless times since then, and it's one of those films you keep watching, over & over because although you know every single detail of the film, you have to go back to it. The actors were pretty good for their age, and the comedy element still creases me up. I'd recommend this film to anyone of any age. I'm glad there wasn't a sequel though, this is a one off classic.",The Goonies

309,llamaherd,One of my all-time favorites,10,7 July 2001,"Richard Donner has always been known for making fast-paced and fun movies. Most people probably associate his name with the Lethal Weapon series.  But whenever I hear his name, I always think of The Goonies.The Goonies is one of those movies that always brings out the kid in me. Everytime I watch it, I fall in love with it all over again.  This isn't the usual teensploitation flick, filled with glamorous, ultra-cute teenagers with whom you can't relate.  These are characters you can relate to.  The kind you could swear lived right down the street from you.  It's hard to not become attached to them and their circumstances.  So when they fall head-first into the adventure of a lifetime, they take you along for the ride.The awesome thing about this movie is that you feel like a member of the group all the way thru the movie.  You feel like one of ""the goonies"".  All the way from the beginning to the end.  It all starts when they find a mysterious treasure map in Mikey's (Sean Astin) attic.  This then triggers a chain of events which eventually puts them into an adventure of Indiana Jones-esque proportions.  As they dodge the many pitfalls and problems that come their way, you find yourself rooting for them, and almost feeling like you're a part of the action.  Never will there be another movie as fun as this one.The acting in this movie is top notch, considering the majority of the actors and actresses were pre-teens at the time of filming.  Like I said, these characters are everyday characters you swear were ripped straight from your childhood.  Sean Astin is great as Mikey, a teen in his early, and awkward, pubescent years.  He's kind of the all-round average guy, but is the glue that holds the group together, thus being the hero.  Josh Brolin is great as his older brother, Brandon.  He does everything you picture an older brother to do: picks on Mikey and his friends and acts like a toughguy, while at the same time adding some guidance and looks out for his younger bro.  Chunk, my favorite character, is played brilliantly by Jeff Cohen.  I never fail to laugh at him bumbling around and shooting his mouth off.  Corey Feldman is in top form here as ""Mouth"", playing the part of the cool guy (as usual).  Jonathan Ke Quan is hilarious as ""Data"", a child genius with all kinds of quirky little inventions to help his friends out along the way (yet not very skilled at using them just yet).  Kerri Green is great in being the pretty face of the movie as Andrea (""Andy"" for short), and is a possible love interest of Brandon.  Martha Plimpton is good as Andy's friend, but doesn't have too many lines.  She does provide good chemistry between her and Mouth, though, hinting at a possible relationship in the future.  The Fratelli family is portrayed quite well by Davi, Pantoliano, and Ramsey.  I'd say they do a sufficient job at being as scary as possible in their given roles as a family of hot-headed criminals out to find a stash of treasure, thus bumping heads with the kids and posing much of a threat.This movie might not carry the same worth with others as it does with me, given it's nostalgic value.  So I must admit that my views may be a little biased.  But, I feel that this film works on all levels at providing comedy, adventure, and thrills galore.  If you're looking for a fun movie to watch, I HIGHLY recommend giving The Goonies a chance.  I know very few people who have been disappointed with this movie, so I think it's definitely worth a shot.  It's too hard not to fall in love with this move and it's characters.",The Goonies

314,jailhouserocker03,A Fun Movie,8,28 January 2002,"I love the Goonies because it's silly. It's a classic movie dealing with kids on an adventure to save their home from being foreclosed. The leader of the Goonies, Mikey (played by an adorable Sean Astin), finds a map of an ancient pirate's (""One-Eyed Willy"") treasure. The Goonies follow the map and wind up in caves deep underground and have to keep their wits about them to get to the coveted treasure. The characters are extremely comical, and there is an element of romance between Andy (a cute cheerleader) and Brand (Mikey's older and hunky brother). I will never get tired of the movie, simply because it is silly and it fun to watch. The story is so out there that you can't help but like it. It makes you want to be a part of the adventure and makes you feel like a kid again.",The Goonies

You can keep all your citizen kanes because when i watch a movie i am looking for 100% entertainment.  And luckily enough this film provides 101% entertainment. I could talk about how much i love this film all day and how brilliant all the characters are.  But the single greatest part of the film is the relationship between sloth and chunk.  They both would be amazingly funny by themselves but pair them together and you have the single greatest comic duo on the face of the planet. How can you not laugh when they are declaring their love to each other or the lines which sloth comes out with, ""hey you guys"" for instance.  But my favourite line is where chunk screams, ""its a stiff"".  It still has me in stitches at the 100th viewing.",The Goonies
318,saralou,To whom it may concern,10,2 January 2005,"From the start of the opening credits of Ma and her two sons fleeing through Astoria at high speeds whilst introducing us to a small band of kids who we lovingly came to know as the Goonies, to a pirate ship sailing into the distance which puts POTC to shame with it's authentic grace 'The Goonies' is one of those movies which aimed to please and did so much more.It's the grand adventure which every child young and old wishes they could have lived and nigh on twenty years later still impresses. The eighties produced some memorable movies in it's decade and 'The Goonies' along with others stands the test of time. With the small band of heroes Mikey, Mouth, Chunk and Data with the addition of some older but non the wiser teenagers of Brand, Andi and Steph we are taken on the grandest adventure with the simplest of terms. A treasure hunt. Every trick in the book is thrown in, A car chase, a treasure map with cryptic clues, dubloons, pirates, underground caves, dead guys, bad guys, pirate ships and skeletons. And of course Sloth.It's the stuff fairy tales couldn't get enough of and yet it was so real you almost wished yourself to Astoria to live the grand adventure itself. You can't help but laugh at each small intricate detail to the sarcasm of Mouth and how to 'pack the drugs' to poor Chunk relaying his life story to save his poor fingers from the blender. Throw in Mikey to touch the soft spot in your heart and raise a tear, and Data who has a gadget to get you out of every situation. Andi and Brand provide the romance, although in saying Mikey gets a look in too and Steph tries and fails to provide the adult expertise before reverting to perfect sarcasm battles with Mouth. And all this whilst being chased by the Fratelli's.All in all, praise upon praise cannot say how good 'The Goonies' is, I was five when it was released, and it's been a favourite from then, although I do remember being scared of Sloth at the time. I killed off the version I watched and re-watched and re-watched recorded onto video from all those years ago, bought it on VHS and killed that version too, Thankfully DVD's are that little bit more hard wearing. I hope to be watching it in another twenty years time and still loving it.",The Goonies
319,honeybee3-275-796667,Great flick,8,28 January 2012,"The first time I saw THE GOONIES was at a friend's house right when it was a ""new release"" on video. After the best times I had in my life watching it, the friend established a ""Goonie"" club for the fun of it. Perhaps your past childhood memories would have been the same, too! While the movie is a tad heavy on the stupid foul jokes, it does have the imagination of willing to trek around for some perilous adventures, plus a few spooks. There possibly was never a movie like this providing tons of fun and laughter during the time. The characters and their personalities were most original, including ""Data"" and his supply of gadgets, and ""Chunk"" with his obese but likable image (love that ""Truffle Shuffle""!). But ""Sloth"" easily stole the show with his own likable personality, a goon with the weirdest face I've ever seen in my life! Just think of how fun it is to discover lost treasure, when you know it's only fantasy. Four key things come to mind with THE GOONIES: pirate ships, teenagers, the Frattellis, and Cyndi Lauper. They're actually ""good enough"" and they go together in this memorable journey! Kudos to Richard Donner for bringing me a movie that I've seen over 100 times and never stop enjoying! After all these years, I'm STILL waiting for a sequel! HIT PUREE!!!",The Goonies
320,anthonywlafemina,One of the all time best movies,10,22 August 2013,"Let me start by saying if you've read any negative reviews try to keep in mind these are people who never learned the lesson ""if you don't have anything good to say, don't say anything at all."" There's a huge difference between saying ""it's not for me"" and running it into the ground. Whining about children yelling in a movie mostly cast with children, is kind of idiotic.That being said, The Goonies is one of the quintessential movies of the 80's, and it has never lost its shine. This movie is easily a 10, it will always be a 10...even after you've watched it over and over. It never gets stale. I loved it at 15 years old and I love it at 40 years old. It captures a little bit of everything...action, romance, drama, adventure, suspense..all wrapped in your childhood. If you want to have a good time, sit down and pay attention to this movie. A fun rousing adventure. Each of the actors and actresses (as well as writers and director, basically everyone involved) should be given a posthumous Oscar award, for touching people so artistically. I found it extremely distasteful someone called out Martha Plimpton and put her down over others. She was in integral part of the whole mixture. The movie just works. It's like magic in a bottle. Naysayers, take a hike...no one cares what you think.",The Goonies

You can't help but will them on, laugh at their banter and split your sides at the now legendary hufle-shuffle by the chubby kid in the film.A bunch of kids going off to search for lost treasure to help save their parents house which is being demolished for a corporate golf course is an ideal set up for childhood heroism and adventure. Spooky in parts it was said to be based on a real happening of the writer/director Steven Spielberg.  From start to finish it's an enjoyable ride with certain moral tendencies in parts and a bit of brotherly sentimentality that does it no harm. a true classic film of the eighties, highly recommended.",The Goonies

Chunk and Data are both funny too. Some parts in this movie are priceless, and make it an enjoyable film to watch. The main four kids (Mikey, Mouth, Data, and Chunk) all contributed something to the film, but the only thing about this movie that doesn't make sense is what are the other three there for? I guess Brand and Andy add an extra element, but I honestly don't see the purpose of Stef's character.

I went into the film with big expectations. I wanted to watch a funny, enjoyable and all round family film, but I finished it wondering why I spent my time on a lazy, boring and basically dumb movie. I don't understand the choice to have every kid in the film just try and shout over each other, through the screaming I could barely make out any of the dialogue and when it finally seemed to settle down, what I could make out of the script was that it was just lazy writing, everything was just too convenient. Everyone's entitled to their own opinion and mine is that the action and characters are just plainly implausible and the whole film is just a bore from start to finish. I hear the excuse of ""it's a kids film"" and to me, that just seems like a poor excuse for a film you think is infallible because it's a nostalgic movie and was one of you're favourites growing up however sometimes people don't want to accept the truth and yet the truth is that it's actually just a ridiculous and stupid 2 hour mess!!! I have a good friend who I rely on for film recommendations and she said to me ""you've got to accept that it's an 80's kids film"" and I do, it's just that Back to the Future was released in the same year, merely 2 weeks apart, with the same certificate, and to me there isn't a comparison between which film is better. Back to the future for me is a film which ages like fine wine, whereas Goonies, I hate to say it but it's aged as well as a PT cruiser.",The Goonies

Although it did come with it's pg-13 scenes, it still will find a way in anyone's heart, if they're willing to open up to it.Even the shots the director uses to portray what will happen bring out real thought and creativity. I haven't watched the movie in a while, but I can tell you, you won't ever really forget it.

This movie is a great adventure, perfect for both the young ones and the old ones. The characters are very interesting and some are really funny. They have their own life and their own story to tell. And together they make this movie to something special. I can only remember one other movie that I can compare to this one; Stand By Me (Corey Feldman has a role in this movie and in The Goonies). Almost the same characters and a bit of an adventure (even though it is more quite and slow in a sense). See The Goonies and become a part of a real Spielberg Adventure!",The Goonies

It came out when I was 5 years old and I remember being so facinated by the adventure & props, especially the pirate ship. I've had the video for some time now, and the only reason I got a DVD player was because they just put the Goonies out on DVD with the cut-scenes.
This movie is what friendships are made of. That's the best thing about the movie, I think. What could be more fun & exciting than an all-out adventure complete with pirate ships, booby traps, & a treasure at the end? Going through it with your best friends!I'm 22 and this is still one of me & my friends' favorite things to do- hang out, watch the Goonies & recite every single word!",The Goonies

I only saw this because my mother had recorded it off channel five and not being a film fan, had promptly not watched it, leaving it to me to tell her about it. I watched it and instantly fell in love with it. Even though at times it's corny and unrealistic, the enthusiasm in the little people and the amazing story makes up for it completely. One friend I showed it to, disliked it, however I am under the impression she is a crazed lunatic, who has had the disadvantage of pretending to be mature and therefore missed out on the wonder that is 'The Goonies'! You can quickly connect with the characters and their need for excitement and adventure. One can laugh at their jokes, and generally all the crazy things they say; scream at the bad people and the giant squid and join in their amazing adventure. This film shows you seven children's last desperate attempt to remain in the home they love, with the friends they have been forced to make after the rest of the world rejected them. Like 'stand by me' it is a story of growth and heroism and how friendship is precious enough to die for.",The Goonies

Now I feel like such a freaking old fart. But still it's a great movie! And nice to see that it stands the test of time. The kids are laughing and totally into it.

340,nicolas-turner,Litmus Test,2,13 December 2015,"This is the film that I use as a Litmus test to whether or not a person that I am talking with has good taste in movies. If they say they liked it, then I know we're going to have a difficult time picking out a movie to watch together. Now, I have to admit that I never saw this film as a kid. However, that does not mean that it gets a pass. A movie should be able to hold up, whatever stage of life the viewer is in. Some people have nostalgic memories associated with films like the Goonies, which confuses their judgment of the quality of the film. Just because it's something you grew up with does not mean it is something that other people should enjoy. There are several movies that I enjoyed as a kid that I still enjoy. Likewise, there are several movies that I did not like as a kid, that I still dislike. I'm sure that I would not like the Goonies now, even if I had seen it as a kid, because I'm sure I would not have liked it as a kid.",The Goonies
341,skacimdb,Only for Kids under 15 or maybe under 12,6,26 April 2009,This is a movie with a bunch of kids who save their part of the town from being turned into a golf course. There are lot of times in the movie when you might feel 'that's silly' but it might be a nice watch for the kids. Kids might have lot of fun watching a bunch a kids trying to pull off a breath taking treasure adventure. But for an adult mind it looks too childish and at times boring. I gave this 6 considering it might be lot of fun for kids under the age group of 15 or maybe 12 but I would have personally given it only 4 or 5 out of 10.Maybe I expected a lot from this as the story was from Steven Spielberg. But the whole movie is based on some impulsive events that take place all in one day. The connectivity is loose at many instances and the humour is real immature or too juvenile. The movie starts with a small introduction of each character but is very lame. Overall it's good if the kids want to watch some adventure flick but otherwise it's a total waste of time.,The Goonies
342,Goonie89,The greatest film of the 80s,10,22 January 2007,"The Goonies is a must-see for anyone who love movies, it is a treasure. The film is about a batch of kids named The Goonies who find a treasure map in a attic. When one of them realise that this may actually lead them to treasure he and his buddies decide to go on a fascinating hunt for it in a effort to save them from being forced out of their homes. Along the way they meet three crooks and Sloth- a lovable character who makes friends with the ""truffle shuffle kid"" Chunk, after he is caught by the crooks, and together they go looking for his friends to rescue them. So i advise you, anyone who has not seen this movie watch it as you will certainly be missing out otherwise. You will like this movie if you like films such as ""The Never-Ending Story"", ""Legend"", ""Gremlins"" and ""Labyrinth""",The Goonies

There were always new ""caves"" to discover and land that just had to have treasure in it somewhere. I was bound and determined to find it. The first time I watched The Goonies, I wanted to be as brave and determined as Mikey. I wanted to be a Goonie.When this movie caught my eye, I knew that we would have to have it. Adventure was my forte and I wasn't going to let this adventure slip through my fingers. It made me want to go find Mikey and say, ""Hey lets go get that treasure together!"" The movie is set in 1985 in Astoria, Oregon. Seven kids only have a few days left before their homes get bought and turned into a golf course. They are desperate to find anything that can help save their house. While digging around in the attic, Mikey finds a treasure map that leads to the legendary treasure of ""One-Eyed"" Willy. There adventure begins at an abandoned summer restaurant. It is owned by the wanted Fratelli thieves.

I know what the octopus looks like and I know it would have filled my pants if I'd seen it the first time I saw the movie.The Goonies will stand the test of time. I know this to be true. When I worked at a cinema I forced a cult film season to be shown and it was my one aim to get this on regardless. And it was on. And it sold out. In fact, it sold out and had to be moved to a larger screen to accomodate more people - and then it sold out again.Why? This film is timeless. Yes, the music holds it back and yes, it is a bit jumpy (the cinema print anyway) but there is nothing like this film and there will be nothig like this film. The only thing that comes remotely close is Indiana Jones. It is was and always will be original. No-one will ever top it.The Goonies. You know you love it.",The Goonies

Great ""Goonie"" Relaxation.......",9,7 February 2012,"I can remember seeing this several times in the theater with my friend Geoff Chisholm. Years later I would have the chance to see the house where the the ""Walsh family home"" was located (on a tour of Astoria, Oregon).Astoria, a safe harbor town in the peaceful pacific northwest is a rarity in this day and age. The film seemed to bring the town to life. Not featured in the film is a quaint street car line. It is quite a lovely place to spend a weekend and certainly the continued success of the film has contributed to its survival.One of the most interesting spots to visit in Astoria is the classic JC Penney store. The store on the outside resembles something from the 1930's. Inside you'll find much of the same contemporary merchandise you'd find at any JC Penney store in any mall. But Astoria, seems to have a magical ability to preserve its history and stay current at the same time.Same is true for this film. It doesn't SEEM like a 27 year old movie.But it is.Actually it isn't. The movie is the same. We are just all 27 years older.Watching it today through the prism of a man with 27 years of life experience doesn't make it any less exciting.The car chase on the beach.The creative gadgetry of ""Data"" sliding down the home made zip line. ""Data"" had a zip line BEFORE any one knew what a zip line was.Chunk knocking over the statue and ""breaking Brandon's mother's favorite part"".A very private part by the way.Jeff Burleson and Geoff Chisholm (we took the whole staff to a screening in Sisters, OR on Maple Lane at Loker Avenue) heartily recommend this film for anyone who loves teenage adventure, wholesome goodness and the hard work of Steven Spielberg BEFORE he became STEVEN Spielberg.",The Goonies
352,ulmaroperez,Love this movie.,8,19 September 2018,"This movie has a lot of good memories for me as a child growing up in the 90s. When I watched this movie the first time I was around seven or eight years old and lived with both of my parents in a small house in Plant City FL. We lived right across the street from the Strawberry Festival.If you ever watch this movie and its your first time doing so then do yourself a solid and try to reach back into your childhood, (if your an adult), and imagine your seven to twelve year old self watching this. It would make a lot more sense if you did it that way. This movie was created with love and it shows in every single scene. The adult actors in the film were superb, the children actors did an amazing job, even Mouth who grew up to be, well not so great. I love every single one of them and every single time I see this movie it brings back the great childhood memories I had living in my childhood home. It also makes me want to turn back into a kid and go treasure hunting like they did in the film. I plan on doing this with my daughter. The music was awesome and fun, the settings were really well done and the ship was a real freaking Pirate Ship.Listen this isn't really a review just something to try and get you to see this movie with your kids or if you do not have any, then with yourself not going in and expecting a modern story because its nothing like that. Its a movie to be enjoyed with the heart and soul of a child looking for adventure not for adults looking for a serious down to earth film.",The Goonies

The CONSTANT screaming and yelling by all the characters was more than I could take. The dialog was stupid, the characters over-acted, the fat kid was annoying as hell, and the amount of plot holes made this laughable at best. The premise of the movie is great...a remake could do well, but as this stands I couldn't stand to hear one more second of it.And seriously, they cast Martha Plimpton??? Of all the struggling actors in Hollywood, this is who they picked? I guess they needed a homely girl that couldn't act, so they picked her (with Kerri Green being a close second).",The Goonies

However, as a child growing up it was a film I would see on the TV (usually around Christmas, when a lot of films were previewing) - and for some reason it would always be my luck to only grab the last hour or thirty minutes of the film.However, nearing the age of 7 years old, my dad set the timer for when it was on - he knew how much I wanted to see the whole episode! I watched it, at at 7 for a film, 9 years old. It became my favourite film ever.For me it just sums up childhood 'one big adventure' - now a fixture in my DVD collection, I could watch it every night of every week and never get boured.

It is a masterpiece in the sense that most of the adventure movies for kids follow it in one or another way. It has elements that make it unique. For instance, the weird Slot. There is no real reason for him, but still, there it is, and it makes the movie a classic. There is a few things that can be better, like kids not knowing where to go or what to do instead of them solving all the problems immediately. One thing we all want is an extended version, Is it real the octopus scene? The scenes at the town buying maps where good, and also introduces the bully and the relations with the girls. This movie deserved a second part, but unfortunately actors are now too old and a new remake cannot be better than original.",The Goonies

Over the decades I've heard people just a few years my junior rave about this as if it were an Indiana Jones or a gremlins or the like. So finally at the ripe old age of 46 I've had a look. I cannot believe the hype for this. The director's overriding instruction to the actors, seems to have been, shout and scream and say your dialogue whilst everyone else is saying theirs. That will keep the audience thrilled and excited. It gave this member of the audience a headache. The storyline is weak, the characters 2 dimensional and the script is dire. I kept thinking these kids must be off their Ritalin. It was like an onslaught of annoyance. I get that people are nostalgic for movies they saw when they were kids. I still think jaws is one of the greatest films ever made, whereas people younger than me can't abide the plastic shark. But really, I'm amazed that so many people still seem to rate this.

I've seen this movie at least 70 -okay, well maybe not 70- times, and I always catch something different each time; like how Mouth is wearing a ""Purple Rain"" t-shirt.

It was the perfect adventure/fantasy movie. The kids saving the day and the neighborhood. My favorite scenes were where Mouth was translating into Spanish for Rosalita. Her reactions to his translation was funny. Josh Brolin was the perfect big brother for Sean Astin (son of the Riddler from the 60's Batman series). Mouth being scared and then becoming brave at the end was cool. I also remember Cyndi Laupers music video from this movie, I just don't remember the song that she sang, but the ending of the video was funny with her saying Mr. Spielberg get me out of here.

If you are to old not to get the magic of the movie then you should not be watching it in the first place. Sure people of all ages watch it. I thought the movie was very well written.

We both loved it so much that we began to write a sequel to it and almost (but not quite) succeeded.  We'd still love to see a sequel made, but it looks doubtful since talk of one years before this died out almost immediately due to lack of interest from many cast members.

The story is good. The acting is okay, though the characters are quite memorable. Who can forget Data, Sloth, Chunk, Mouth, etc.? I know I can't. The music, especially the theme by Cyndi Lauper, is firmly set in the mid-80's which really adds to the nostolgic effect (I still have the 45!). The score is also good and I think it actually adds something to the feeling of the film. I would definately recommend this to anyone who was a kid in the early/mid 1980's.

381,w-67098,Goonies da Bomb!,10,22 January 2020,"""Hey you guyssss"" GooniesIf you like adventure, mystery, comedy you would love this film. Goonies is based on a group of young boys named Chuck, Mickey, Mouth, Date and an older brother named Brand and two older girls named Andy and Stef searching for a lost pirate ship. The adventure the group runs into on the way to the treasure makes this movie not only comedy but also an emotional journey for the characters and the audience. Filled with puzzles, boobytraps and constant reminders of how many came before them the group works together to create a close bond through the adventure. The group realizes that after this they will all be separated and will never have an adventure like this again. They will be separated by time and distance.Before the movie came out the names alone of the director, Richard Donner, and the writers, Chris Columbus (screenplay) and Steven Spielberg (story by) already had a reputation for having good movies. Donner directed The Superman movies which were a hit. Spielberg is accredited with E.T. and Indian Jones with many other hit movies following. Chris Columbus was a screenplay writer for Gremlins which was referenced in the movie Goonies. With these three involved Goonies was destined to be a good movie.The group tested their luck hiring both a mix of seasoned and new actors to play leading roles in the movie. The new actors included Mikey (Sean Astin), Chunk (Jeff Cohen), Data (Ke Huy Quan), and Andy (Kerri Green). All of these actors had experience acting in one or less movies. The seasoned actors included Brand (Josh Brolin), Mouth (Corey Feldman), and Stef (Martha Plinpton). These actors all worked well together to make you feel like you were part of this group. The group of characters in this film have continued to make other notable films.The characters brought the overall feeling of the movie due to their high acting skills. Although some of these actors were new to acting they took on the role they were assigned well. Between the serious characters, the comedians, and the floaters the audience is able to identify with the characters and build a connection to their personalities. The director and writers made the characters consistent throughout the story which gave an understanding to the audience of what to expect from each character. From the beginning of the movie Mikey took on a serious role. This was first seen at Mikey's house when Chunk was trying to get in and Mouth would not unlock the gate until he did the Truffle Shuffle. Mikey made sure that they stopped playing around and let him in. Speilberg and Columbus showed throughout the movie that kids will be kids at even scary times. During suspenseful moments the group continues to crack jokes and still act like young boys.I would rate this movie 10 out of 10 stars! Spielberg, Columbus, and Donner have created a movie that is good for all ages. Goonies is the bomb go and watch it.",The Goonies

I bought the movie and I watch it every chance I get when it is on TV. I would rate it four stars. If you haven't seen this movie you really should. It is a fun filled family movie that the whole family could enjoy. I hope you enjoy the movie as much as I did. The acting and the dialog where good. The different characters made the movie great. There were some points I laughed so hard I cried. This movie is sure to make you laugh.

383,ben9875,The Gold Standard for 80's kids films,9,22 December 2006,"The Goonies is an absolutely classic children's film that will be a favourite for years to come. A superbly paced and well acted film, it keeps you energised and totally focused on the ensuing action.When I first saw the film, aged about 10, I was totally entranced from the dangerous treasure hunting stunts to the hilarious comedic elements involving Data and, of course, The Fratellis.I still watch this today on DVD (which by the way has a great reunion of the original cast on it - Chunk looks very different these days!) and it stands up as a film that can be watched and enjoyed by adults. It has a dreamlike innocence, without being mawkish, that is sadly lacking in many of today's films for children. Even better is the fact that this is achieved with a cast of kids who are not perfect, but reflect how kids really are. There are badly behaved, spoilt, obese, intelligent, sensitive, sports mad, vain, asthma-ridden and geeky characters on show but by the end you feel something for them all.An amazing film and a cultural reference point for growing up in the 80's.",The Goonies

They have to do this within 24 hours because the rich kid in town, Troy, his dad is planning on bulldozing all the houses and making it into one big golf course.To make matters worse the kids have to get their before three wanted criminals the ""Fratelli's"" get to it first.

392,JenniferB-2,A Classic!,10,31 January 2002,"""The Goonies"" is definitly one of my all time favorite movies! It reminds me of adventures I always use to fantasize about as a kid. The plot is about a group of outcast friends (they call themselves the Goonies) who find a treasure map of a long lost treasure. The kids, who are about to lose their houses decide to try and help their parents by embarking on the adventure of a lifetime. On their search for 'the rich stuff' they uncover the hideout of the Fratelli's, a family of bumbling bad guys. The child actors are amazing. My personal favorite is Mikey, (played by an adorable Sean Astin) the leader of the group. You may also see some other familar faces, like Corey Feldman-the wise cracking 'Mouth', Josh Brolin-macho big brother 'Brand', and Martha Plimpton-Andi's friend 'Stef'. This movie is a great childhood classic. I highly recommend it even if you are just a kid at heart. It has great 80's styles and feeling. It is a movie you can never get tired of, (believe me, I've seen this movie atleast 30 times!!!! And it is still one of my favorites.) If you haven't seen this movie yet go out and rent it! And if you have a DVD player, check out the DVD. It has a full length commentary by 'The Goonies' all grown up!I give this movie a 10/10!!!!!",The Goonies

It is also sweet to see Joe Pantiliano in a criminal character role before the days of The Sopranos as Ralph. Sloth by far is the coolest character when he and Chunk become best friends.

404,stewar85,A Goonies Film Review,9,29 July 2010,"The Goonies is about a group of young adults that guide themselves into an adventure on the quest to find a legendary lost treasure. The film illustrates the importance of working as a team to beat impossible circumstances. Sean Astin plays the main character Mikey, who is first to discover an old treasure map in family home's attic. His brother Brand is played by a young, Josh Brolin. These two play opposites character wise. Brand is more athletic and strong while Mikey is smaller and has an external weakness of asthma. However it is Mikey that is the one who guides the group of misfits through an underground, booby trap adventure and discover the treasure. The brother's family home is about to be foreclosed on unless their parents can come up with the money.Other stars of the film include Goonies: Kerri Green, who plays Andy, a cheerleader and love interest to Brolin's character, Kerri Green, who plays Stef, Corey Feldman as Mouth, Jeff Cohen as Chunk, and Ke-Huy Quan as Data. The group is constantly on the run from the Fratelli crime family, who in the opening scenes helps one of their counterparts escape jail. Anne Ramsey plays Mama Fratelli, who discovers what the ""goony"" group is up to and prompts her sons Jake and Francis, who are played by Robert Davi and Joe Pantoliano, respectively, to chase after them. There is one more son, Sloth, played by John Matoszak, who is deformed and has a growling Frankenstein-like dialog. Sloth is left behind along with a captured Chunk who soon becomes friends over the love for food and they join forces to go save the ""goonies"" from the Fratellis who are on their trail. Each goony character played an important role in helping the group advance further in discovering the treasure. Those that stood out were: Mikey (Astin) who is the encourager that will not give up in helping his family and will not allow the group to give up either, Data (Quan), is equipped with special gadgets that help the goonies get through the trail to the treasure and Mouth (Feldman), is able to interpret the map which is in Spanish and helps to give the film a funnier edge with his smart antics. The character Sloth (Matoszak) ends up becoming an honorary goony for his attempts to rescue them from his family. The Goonies was an earlier kiddy version of the Disney film, National Treasure (2004), which stars Nicholas Cage as a treasure hunter who is looking for mysterious and unbeknown artifacts. Unlike The Goonies his adventures are around the entire country not just below one Oceanside suburb. Perhaps both films draw from the film, Indiana Jones (1981-1989, 2008), which stars Harrison Ford as a part time college professor and part time adventurous historian, who travels the globe to rescue artifacts from the wrong hands and put them in a museum. All these films focus on defeating the odds and a hero shining through at the end. However, I believe Goonies was the first to focus on a group of children on this type of quest. The film uses techniques in camera angles and lighting to give a more realistic feel to the viewer. There are points were you actually forget the adventure is really only taking place underneath a town. Throughout most of the film, low key lighting is used to draw the audience into the setting of the dark cave the group is in. It gives an eerie feeling while at the same time allowing for the element of surprise of what may be up next. It was also very natural like you are right there with the characters, especially when they use candles and flashlights as the main light source. A diagonal camera angle was used in some scenes to present an approaching feel. Especially when the group was traveling into the unknown as one. The characters are in a grouping of shortest to tallest from front to back to give this angle an even greater effect. These techniques were needed to bring the audience into the actions on the screen and engage their interest further.All the elements tie in to make this film enjoyable to watch and be a part of. Each character was able to hold your interest with their unique talent and ways. Each scene of their adventure will allow you to seem as if you are part of the effort to find the treasure. This film gives great significance to the word teamwork and will encourage those biggest to smallest to stop at nothing to make a dream reality.",The Goonies
405,kostenoglou,Omg,1,25 December 2018,A complete stupidity even for kids. Chaotic succession of events kids that are shouting without reason a monster with unexplained origin and a fat boy that is constantly becoming the clown of the company. What a waste of time,The Goonies
406,Alevi,I don't get it...,6,6 November 2012,"What is entertaining about this? I fail to understand what is so great about it. I am 13, I should be the target audience. I saw this movie during a kids film camp, and everybody thought it was so hilarious that.. what? Is it funny that a fat kid jiggles his fat and that there are kids cussing and whining. What really shocks me is that the kids in the camp loved this and hated ""Spirited Away"". IS MY GENERATION THAT STUPID?! I'm going to analyze this film a little further to prove my point, though:ACTING: The actors themselves aren't awful, although they become so annoying at times, you kind of wanted them to die. The one playing the kid with asthma was not captivating at all. He was bland and never showed any real emotion. The others weren't bad, and they probably did the best with the script they were given, which lead to my next point...SCRIPT: Oh yeah, this is where the movie gets awful. The script is just all around unoriginal. In 4th grade,(before I saw this film), I would write adventure stories that were at the same level of this. These stories I wrote were all, honestly: There's a group of kids they go on an adventure underground involving many obstacles like:balance beams, swinging axes, etc. they find treasure, then get out and return to normal life. Sound familiar? I mean, nothing original or interesting happens. I guess you could argue that the piano scene was O.K., but even that wasn't fantastic. The characters were beyond shallow, all bogged down to just stupid quirks. They have no depth and just come off as whiny. Don't believe me? Well, how much development do they have besides fat kid-wimpy, loves food,lies Asian kid-invents things main character- asthma, whispers teenage boy- works out other kid- tries to be cool, but is annoying. YOU NEED TO DEVELOP! but the one element of the movie that really pisses me off is the deformed brother that the villains were keeping in their basement. The fact that they could stoop that low to produce comedy is just horrendous. And what was funny about him? Was it funny that he couldn't talk properly and communicated through yelling? Was it funny that he was wearing a superman shirt? No, it's actually kind of sad, and I'm surprised a lot more people don't hate this movie for exploiting people born with physical deformities like that. They deserve as much respect as people, and this just cruelly makes fun of them.EFFECTS: The main reason I gave this film such a high rating is because the effects were really great. It wasn't beautiful, it was all very brown and gray, but I guess that isn't awful. That was at least pleasing to look at.Well, this is getting pretty long, so I think I'm going to stop. To summarize; while the special effects were great, that doesn't make up for undeveloped characters, a plain, boring script and just O.K. acting. I really, REALLY hate it, but if this is what appeals to you in a film,and it appeals to a lot of people, then just keep enjoying it. Just, don't ask to me to watch it with you.",The Goonies

This movie is pretty much an ode to childhood exuberance, dealing with such fantastical issues such as pirate ships, hidden treasure, bad guys, booby traps (or booty traps whatever's your poison) and the art of having fun.The Goonies themselves are fairly likeable, though they do have a tendency to talk over each other; but I guess that's what kids do.

It's the filming location for The Goonies and it was the termination of the 18th Century Lewis and Clark Expedition. This is no coincidence. Kids want to believe in exploration and empowerment.1985 was right about the time when Nintendo emerged as a new past time for kids to hold up at home staring at a screen. And if kids did go out, they were likely headed to an arcade.Know your market. Donner and Spielberg knew exactly how to tug at the heart strings of kids looking for excitement and adventure. It's an hommage to exploration and Fantasy at a time when Children were considered an emerging market for toy and film companies; hence the popularity of the film.The Goonies wouldn't work in modern times. It's not believable that kids would hop on their bikes and go on an adventure. Kids in the suburbs need mom's car to go anywhere.Throw in an amazing soundtrack and stellar editing...

Most critics here giving 7/10 upwards are just nostalgic freaks voting with childhood emotions. I fast forwarded after 30 minutes and kept doing until the end. It's inconceivable that people actually liked this movie. I read most comments giving 10/10 they are just saying the same thing ""oh my childhood, oh my childhood, oh it's a classic"". God!

418,susannahvwhite,20-somethings and the Goonies,10,20 September 2004,"Just prior to graduating with a degree in Film Studies a lecturer asked us, ""So what's your favourite film now?"" Whilst my peers spouted out Goddard films and obscure German expressionist shorts I sat quietly thinking; my favourite film has been My Favourite Film since I was seven... So when it came to me and I mumbled ""The Goonies"", I was expecting scorn, ridicule and possibly minor injury, but instead was met with concurring shouts and whoops and cries of ""Hey you gu-uys!"" from the rest of the class. You see this is the unifying thing about The Goonies; mention it in a room full of twenty-somethings and they'll whell up and utter ""Sloth loves Chunk"" or adopt a harassed Chinese tone ""Thats what I said...Booty traps!"". And if that room happens to be a pub, several chairs will scrape back and semi-inebriated grown men will lift their shirts, shake their bellies and revel in the truffle shuffle. People may say it's an Indiana Jones wanna-be I think that is the defining beauty of it all. When we first watched The Goonies it was like watching our dreams come true on screen! We'd loved seeing Indiana's adventures and escapades and in The Goonies we saw kids like us actually doing it! They got to be just like the mini-Indies we imagined ourselves to be in the playground. But its not just the adventure that makes us love the film, we love those Goonies themselves. They were like our friends. We got annoyed with them sometimes, and we wanted to protect them, and we laughed at their jokes and cheered when they had a brilliant plan. Identifying with those kids was what we loved and why, as adults, we quote them and 'become' them when talking about the film. I still want to be like Andy, having a perilous adventure sliding down tunnels and facing the bad guys on a huge pirate ship... but of course also making time to kiss Brand AND Mikey!

It always gave me a warm feeling as if it was a true story and that some day it could happen to me. but then i grew up and as i grew older i seemed to love it more and more. its just the whole kids vs adults and that adults aren't always correct. i was born when this movies was made and yet as it gets older it becomes more of a classic to me. i will no doubt be showing every 1 i know in future the film so if you know some 1 that has not seen it. tell them to watch it and you watch their faces as they watch the movie because i guarantee when chunk does that shuffle or mouth tells every 1 to bang on the pipes they will be smiling and laughing along with the film. to be honest there's not any other film on the planet that id rather be left with then this one because it has every thing in it from adventure to thriller (when they getting chased in the cave).,The Goonies

I immediately rewound and watched it again. This was repeated for a lot of my childhood, reenacting scenes with my friends out in the garden.

All of the characters fit the part perfectly. The plot is so interesting, and action packed that you just want to watch it again and again. The funniest character has to be Chunk (truffle shuffle), the best looking Andy (obviously), and the most annoying Troy (grrr). There were talks of there being a sequel, but I think it would most probably ruin what has been built up in the first one, and without the original cast would be pointless.

We have other movies that are PG rated that have no where close to the language in Goonies. You can read over the parental guidance link on IMDb to get the details. We watched the first 15 minutes of it on DVD and I decided to just turn it off. I don't remember all the profanity! Otherwise, it ""would have been"" a great movie for a kid to watch.

Now I regret to have seen it with my oldest.

It was on our SelecTV cable box (remember that?) repeatedly in the next year or so and we knew every line of every character. It was amazing. I literally wanted to BE Kerri Green and, of course, would have loved to have had an adventure like the Goonies had (and to have kissed Josh Brolin).We went camping this last weekend in a yurt and there was a dvd player in it. I took Goonies and watched it with my 11 year old 3 times. He loved it. Much like my older son did (who owns a ""Goonies Never Say Die"" t-shirt) when we watched it together when he was about 10.It's classic. It's a solid story that kids everywhere can relate to.

Much as it is not the Paris Hilton video. However this movie is The Goonies, so it is therefore rated a 10, as a ten is The Goonies. This movie had actors in it.

This was the ""feel good movie"" of the century. We could only be so lucky to have films like this made these days. Prates, adventure, treasure, friendship, comedy, teenage crushes, and action with out the gore and sex scenes. What else could you ask for? The Goonies is a movie that can be kept, and passed down through the generations. I continue to enjoy this movie as much as an adult, as I did as a child.

435,colinargyle,Don't just superficially watch The Goonies.,9,4 December 2015,"In 1985 Steven Spielberg directed a movie titled The Goonies. There is much more to this movie than what simply meets the eye. The Goonies, follows a group of young hooligan boys around their hometown of Astoria, Oregon as they search for a mysterious buried treasure. The Goonies, one of Spielberg's funnier films focuses on younger people, because of this, many movie critics are harsh in their reviews towards. These reviews will sadden those who truly love the movie The Goonies. If watched superficially, what appears in is a bunch of annoying kids running around their hometown without parental supervision as they search for hidden treasure, as well as bad acting and not great filming. But The Goonies teaches lessons that are simple, beautiful, and even for some life changing.  Although the movie is focused on the younger generation all, old and young alike can enjoy and learn from these lessons. Critics have stated, ""The storyline was weak."" Another said, ""The story is annoying."" These critics have only ever watched this movie with a superficial lens, sadly they have failed to see what the movie is all about. Spielberg directed this summer popcorn film in such a way that it can be learned from. These lessons come to us as the Goonies express attributes through their actions as they adapt to the life crisis on hand. One of these examples happens when the young Goonies follow a map to an old summer home, and despite a scary looking family occupying the house they press on to see if they can find the next step on the map. Through this experience the young Goonies teach us the lesson of determination and courage, the attributes are vital in order for us to get through our own life crises. As the Goonies press on they face many traps created to kill them or make them so scared that they would turn around but, these young boys and girls have something driving them. A drive is something that will always help us to get through our lives crises, it will push us not to quit and to do whatever is necessary to reach our goals. Finally, the Goonies show an incredible amount of maturity for their age, with maturity they were able to see and understand what really was important. Having a clear understanding about what was really important to the Goonies, they were able to know what they must do in order for them to get through their crisis.          These are only three examples of how the Goonies personality traits throughout the movie can teach us to better prepare ourselves for when crises come into our lives. These of course are not the only lessons to be learned form The Goonies, but it is a good start. The Goonies is much more then just a silly kids action/adventure movie, its for all generations to learn and grow from. Steven Spielberg produced this movie knowing that he could hide some awesome lessons from the beginning of the movie to the ending credits. As you watch this movie don't just watch it it superficially but to watch it in a deeper way, for in this way will you learn from its lessons, you will soon bee defending this 1980 classic much more.",The Goonies

As if I knew the characters in this movie when I was a kid.

I must say that this was the first 80s film I watched, and I loved it. I have many favorite classic movies, but this one by far is the best from the 80s, or other 80s films like ""The Outsiders (1983)"", ""Stand By Me (1986)"", ""Children of the Corn (1984)"", ""The Breakfast Club (1985)"", are some of the classic 80s films I like even though there's more. I gave this movie a 10 out of 10 because it's an adventure movie, and it's fun for the whole family.

You had the criminal family in the Fratelli's hot on the children's trail to essentially rob the robbers (One Eyed Willie and Crew) who were dead anyway. 3. The ""Booby Traps"" laid out and the obstacles to get to the treasure was enough for me as a young man sitting on the edge of his seat waiting for something horrible to happen to the children.

440,justicetiritas,classic family adventure flick,8,3 November 2016,"With The 'Goonies', Every Day is June 7th!This rowdy child's adventure flick is a must see no matter how old you are. It resembles a mixture between a Little Rascals movie and an Indiana Jones adventure film. The Goonies incorporates a treasure hunt-- action theme that the whole family would enjoy. It is a true 1980's classic written by Steven Spielberg and Chris Colombus. The movie takes place on the Pacific northwestern coastal town where a group of the ""weird"" kids at school convince each other to search for the hidden treasure on One-Eyed Willy's ship. Each iconic character has a unique attitude that brings such life to the movie. Whether it be between the junk food driven teen named Chunk, or the next Inspector Gadget named Huy-Quan, when they're all together, they'll make for an adventure film that will keep your attention the entire hour and 54 minutes.The Goonies also incorporates a heartwarming relationship story between a popular teenager and his lame younger brother that will leave you with a smile on your face. For a movie that was popular when my parents were kids, being made over 30 years ago, is still considered a classic to my generation today. June 7th was announced to be ""Goonies Day"" by the mayor of Astoria, Oregon where the film was shot in 1985.

This film captures the essence of childhood, when you believed in miracles, had no fear and thought you could do anything. The film although made twenty years ago hasn't aged in a bad way at all, however it does manage to show just how bad the so called kids adventure films of today really are. ""The Goonies"" requires kids to use their imagination and to pretend. No matter how many times you see this film it doesn't get old, I still want to be a ""Goonie"", it's for the child in all of us and I always feel nostalgic seeing it again. If you are going to watch this movie, do yourself a favour get it on DVD.

I'm only 13 years old, i wasn't even born when this movie was made. but my sister used to babysit for two kids, whom introduced this great movie to me, then i often saw it on t.v, but never the whole way through. then i rented it and completely fell in love with it. then i immediately started looking around in the phone book for movie places, i called about 16 places. until i found it at a used place. for $12.00. i asked my mom if we could go get it that night, but she said no. so then a couple nights later she surprised me with it.now i am pretty much making it a habit to watch it every single day. i can pretty much tell you when and where things are going to happen. i always say to my friends who watch it...look here comes the good part. i have memorized th whole movie.i have always liked 80's movies. my favorite used to be the breakfast club. i first judged it by the title i would say, Na it sounds pretty stupid. then i watched it and loved it then i soon became obsessed with Molly Ringwald movies like Sixteen Candles, which my mom showed me as one of her favorite movies. and the pretty in pink and all of that stuff, until i decided after i saw the goonies and stand by me that they were my new breakfast clubs (to which i memorized the whole movie too) i liked 80's movies with kids my age. even though stand by me had maybe one girl in the film (and that was Gordie's mother) AND THE GOONIES only had 2 girls who weren't my age i fell in love. i think that Richard Donner...a brilliant man.i HIGHLY recommend this movie to all adults who have had a pirate adventure once in they're life",The Goonies
