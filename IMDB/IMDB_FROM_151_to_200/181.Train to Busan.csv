0,Leofwine_draca,Zombie horror masterwork from Korea,8,1 March 2017,"South Korea has made plenty of horror films over the last couple of decades, but very few of them have been zombie films; the country typically favours ghost or psycho tales like WHISPERING CORRIDORS or I SAW THE DEVIL. That changes with TRAIN TO BUSAN, a Hollywood-feel film that owes more than a debt of inspiration to WORLD WAR Z in its depiction of fast, feral zombies that amass into a CGI-animated crowd on occasion.This film is straightforward enough, with a simple premise: zombies on a train. And yet it also happens to be thoroughly gripping, exciting, and indeed excellent, thanks to the skill of director Yeon Sang-ho who is known for his animated features like KING OF PIGS. The reason this film succeeds where others fail is down to the characterisation, which is superb for a straight horror tale. The characters are realistic, well-drawn, and appealing, and there's plenty of sentiment while at the same time the film narrowly avoids falling into melodrama.This is a visceral journey that has the viewer on the edge of his or her train seat for much of the running time. It starts off eerie and foreboding and then builds a momentum that never flags right up until the end. The CGI effects are pretty good although occasionally weak, but that doesn't matter a jot when everything else is so well portrayed. The actors impress as always in Korea, putting tons of energy and heart into their performances, and as an action-horror film this is difficult to surpass. I enjoyed every moment.",Train to Busan
1,SnoopyStyle,Korean zombie train,8,9 August 2017,"It's the start of the zombie apocalypse. The population is caught unaware. An injured girl scrambles onto a train leaving Seoul for Busan. She had been bitten by an infected and soon becomes an infected herself. The infection spreads and the survivors find safety in a few cars. Among the survivors are a girl and her often-absent fund manager father, a strong man and his pregnant wife, two elderly sisters, a baseball team and one cheerleader, and a selfish businessman.This is solid zombie fare. The zombies are reminiscent of World War Z. In fact, it might as well be a small part of that franchise. The characters are well-drawn. They are memorable. There are about ten good characters. The action is thrilling and scary both small and large scale. There is good tension throughout. There is one climatic scene that is trying too hard emotionally but that's a small flaw in an otherwise flawless action film.",Train to Busan
2,Prismark10,Train to Busan,7,28 April 2019,"Train to Busan (Busanhaeng) is a South Korean survivalist zombie movie.It owes more to the Hollywood disaster movies on the 1970s such as The Poseidon Adventure or the Airport films.Seok-woo is a divorced fund manager. A workaholic who never has much time for his young daughter Su-an. They board a train so she can visit her mother. An injured young woman scrambles onto the train before it leaves Seoul. She had been bitten and becomes infected by some type of virus that turns her into a flesh eating zombie.As she bites others, they too become infected and in turn attack other passengers and staff. Some of the survivors try to move quickly to the safe carriages.Survivors include Seok-woo and his daughter, a pregnant woman and her macho husband, two elderly sisters, members of a high school baseball team, a selfish tycoon and a few others. As the train journey continues, they get picked off one by one.The zombies have been inspired by World War Z as at times they can be fast moving. The director has done well in maintaining tension and a claustrophobic atmosphere before moving the action to other places.The characters are nicely fleshed out and this is one of the better zombie movies.",Train to Busan
3,claudio_carvalho,One of the Best Zombie Films ever Made,8,14 September 2016,"The investment manager Seok Woo (Yoo Gong) is a divorced man that lives in Seoul, with his daughter a Soo-an (Soo-an Kim) and his mother. Seok Woo is a selfish man and neglects Soo-an that misses her mother that lives in Busan. On Soo-an's birthday, she asks to visit her mother and Seok Woo travels with her with the intention of returning after lunch. They board the fast train KTX and a sick woman also boards another wagon. During the journey, the woman attacks a train staff and soon all the passenger in the wagon are attacked turning into zombies. Soon Seok Woo realizes that there is a zombie outbreak in South Korea and together with the passenger Sang Hwa (Dong-seok Ma), who is traveling with his pregnant wife Sung Gyeong (Yu-mi Jeong), they isolate the safe front wagons from the infected ones. Along their journey, the non-infected passengers have to fight the zombies and the selfishness of the human being. ""Busanhaeng"", a.k.a. ""Train to Busan"", is one of the best zombie films ever made. The story is original and there is deep character development, which is not usual in horror movies, showing the different behavior of the human being in a stressful situation depending on his or her character (or lack of). The direction is amazing and the action scenes are fantastic. The screenplay is melodramatic but also attractive; the beautiful cinematography and special effects and make-up are highlighted by perfect edition. The cast has good performance but the girl Soo-an Kim is impressive and steals the show. We hope Hollywood industry does not destroy this little gem with the usual remake. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): Not Available",Train to Busan
4,nogodnomasters,Keyword: Zombie,8,8 October 2017,"Seok Woo is a fund manager in Seoul. His wife left him and lives in Busan. Seok didn't spend a lot of time with his family, always at work. After screwing up his daughter Soo-an's birthday, he fulfills her wish of wanting to go to Busan and see her mother. During this time there is ""a small leak at the plant"" which leads to the proverbial zombie outbreak and of course one gets on the train to create havoc for the film.The film is a bit heavy. It is about family, sharing, and sacrifice...things Seok Woo placed second to himself. He now must work as a team and learn different values to save his daughter. The film becomes a bitter-sweet zombie drama before it is all over. Almost 2 hours long and needs about 10-15 minutes cut from it.Guide: No sex or nudity. No swearing in the English subtitles, but I think there was some in Korean not translated.",Train to Busan
5,kosmasp,Even Korea isn't safe,8,17 April 2017,"From zombies that is. Obviously if you're not into horror and/or zombies you probably shouldn't watch this. While it does also work as a drama (some of the best horror movies do), there is a lot of blood and a lot of violence. Just putting that out there (or should it be in there?). They also made an Anime as prequel to this. And while that is good in its own right (if you don't have an aversion against animated movies), you don't have to watch it beforehand.The acting is more than decent for a movie like this, but it is really a fast paced movie, so once it starts running, there is no real slowing down. Which is also true of the zombies. So if you're a ""purist"", you may take issue with that. I personally like the slow zombies myself too. It becomes more of an action movie, when they run. Having said that, when it's done as good as it is here, I don't mind either.South Korea is good when it comes to action, so that was kind of to be expected. If you had the opportunity to watch this on the big screen, good for you. But with home cinemas evolved there is enough to take and enjoy at home too. Best watch it with friends though, to get a vibe going",Train to Busan
6,lee_eisenberg,zombie express,10,29 January 2017,"Another zombie movie? Yes, and Yeon Sang-ho's ""Busanhaeng"" (""Train to Busan"" in English) is a cool one. The plot involves a zombie apocalypse overrunning South Korea, while a group of train passengers tries to contain the infected passengers. Just as most zombie movies give their living dead unique attributes, this one does: the zombies can't see in the dark, so they have to rely on their hearing (meaning that the living can sneak past silently when the train passes through tunnels).It's not a masterpiece, but fun. I suspect that it's fun to play zombies, or whatever the infected people are supposed to be. The subplot about the absentee father and his daughter trying to reconnect gave the movie a more human side than most zombie movies out there. I hope that Yeon continues making movies like this.",Train to Busan
7,Woodyanders,"One hell of an intense, exciting, and emotional ride",9,6 November 2019,"A motley assortment of passengers on a train going from Seoul to Bosun are put in great jeopardy when they find themselves caught up in a sudden zombie outbreak both on said train and in the outside world as well.Director/co-writer Sang-ho Yeon keeps the gripping story hurtling along at a breathless breakneck pace, takes time to develop the characters, ably builds a tremendous amount of nerve-rattling tension, maintains a tough take-no-prisoners tone throughout, and stages the attack scenes with rousing go-for-the-throat gusto. Most importantly, Yeon and co-writer Joo-Suk Park bring a surprising pronounced element of pathos and humanity to the premise which in turn ensures that there's plenty of genuinely moving heart to go along with all the harrowing horror. The excellent acting by the tip-top cast further keeps the film on track, with especially stand-out contributions from Yoo Gong as negligent workaholic dad Seok-woo, Su-an Kim as his estranged daughter Soo-an, Dong-seok Ma as the brave Sang-hwa, Yu-mi Jung as the pregnant Seong-Kyeong, Eui-sung Kim as selfish business tycoon Yon-suk, Gwi-hwa Choi as a scared homeless guy, and Sohee as perky cheerleader Jin-hee. The infected folks are extremely ferocious and frightening. Proof positive that there's still some invigorating life left in the zombie horror genre.",Train to Busan
8,Tweekums,Train to Busan,9,7 August 2019,"Seok-woo is a workaholic fund manager living in Seoul with his mother and Su-an, his young daughter. She is desperate to see her mother, who lives four hundred and fifty kilometres away in Busan. Eventually her father agrees to take her and together they board the train to Busan. As the train prepares to depart we are introduced to a few other characters; a man and his pregnant wife; a pair of older women; a school girl and her boyfriend a wealthy business executive; a homeless man who keeps saying 'everybody is dead!' and a girl who is behaving strangely. Soon after the train sets off this girl attacks a train attendant... it is clear that she was infected with something that causes extreme violence. It isn't long before more and more become infected and survivors are barricading themselves in the remaining safe parts of the train. If that weren't enough it is clear that the infection is affecting people throughout South Korea.I really enjoyed this South Korean zombie film; it provided tension from soon after the start right to the final scene. The zombies are more like those infected in '28 Days Later' than classic slow shuffling ones some people might not be keen on that but I think so long as they are scary all is good... and these provided the scares. The film nicely establishes rules that these particular zombies follow. Inevitably there are plenty of gory scenes, but nothing too excessive, and it isn't entirely obvious who, if anybody, will survive. The key characters are introduced well and fairly quickly; they include a good cross section of society and both heroes and cowards. Setting the film in the confined space of a speeding train adds an extra danger as there are limited places for survivors to hide safely for any length of time. The cast is solid and make us believe in their characters; similarly the special effects are pretty impressive. Overall I'd say that this is definitely a film to watch if you like zombie movies.These comments are based on watching the film in Korean with English subtitles.",Train to Busan

10,BA_Harrison,First class all the way.,9,18 September 2016,"Train To Busan can be summed up in four words: zombies on a train. But what director Sang-ho Yeon does with this simple premise is extremely impressive, giving the somewhat tired zombie genre another jolt of life.Using his confined location—a packed intercity train—to maximum effect, Yeon expertly ramps up the tension, the living gradually whittled down to a handful of passengers fighting for survival against the slavering undead (a bit like taking the last train home from Waterloo on a Saturday night).There are some great ideas present that really add to the excitement, such as the zombies getting confused whenever the train enters a tunnel and swarming in numbers to break through barriers (with special effects easily on a par with those in World War Z). Surprisingly, the gore quotient is very low, but with such a rollicking pace, the lack of blood really isn't an issue.Perhaps a touch too long at almost two hours to be perfect, Train to Busan is nevertheless one of the better zombie films to come out in recent years. Highly recommended. 8.5/10, rounded up to 9 for IMDb.",Train to Busan
11,paul_haakonsen,"Snakes move over, because now there are zombies on a train...",8,7 October 2016,"Oh yeah! South Korea is back on the zombie map once again with another overly impressive feature. This time it is ""Train to Busan"" (aka ""Busanhaeng""). And I dare say that with this 2016 movie then director Sang-ho Yeon really solidly places South Korea on the zombie world map definitively.And although most of the entire movie takes place on a train from Seoul bound for Busan, then that is not really a hindrance to the enjoyment of the movie, because there is so much action and thrills to be had along the way that you forget that it only takes place on a train. But having the movie taking place on a train does also add some sense of claustrophobia and limiting the options of the protagonists.The story told in ""Train to Busan"" is about Seok Woo (played by Yoo Gong) a fairly neglectful father whom is traveling to Busan with his daughter Soo-an (played by Soo-an Kim). A deadly outbreak of infection spreads on the train, turning people into ravenous zombies hungry for human flesh, trapping the people aboard the train with nowhere to run.There is not really a dull moment throughout the course of this movie, and it does kick up into a high gear early on, and the movie keeps that pace all the way to the end. And that is really an accomplishment for director Sang-ho Yeon.The acting in ""Train to Busan"" is quite good, and it is good to see Yoo Gong in a movie such as this. But I must admit that I was more than impressed with the talents of child actress Soo-an Kim. She was really amazingly talented, and I think that she will go on to have an impressive career in acting.The effects in the movie were quite good, with just the right amount of gore and mayhem without it crossing into the gorefest territory. So this movie will appeal to a wide audience of fans of the zombie genre.""Train to Busan"" had initially slipped under my radar and I wasn't aware of the movie, before someone actually asked me whether or not I was aware that this was a zombie movie. So with that information, I immediately sought out the movie, and there is no regret here at all, because I was more than genuinely entertained and more than impressed with the final result of the movie.I can strongly recommend that you sit down to watch ""Train to Busan"" if you are a zombie aficionado like me. South Korea is making a lasting dent on the zombie world map, and if this is the level of future zombie movies from South Korea, then count me in for the long run.""Train to Busan"" scores a solid eight out of ten stars rating from me; no doubt about it.",Train to Busan
12,Hey_Sweden,All aboard!,7,6 February 2017,"Yoo Gong plays Seok Woo, a workaholic father who hasn't been enough of a presence in his daughter Soo-ans' (Soo-an Kim) life. Still, when she yearns for a trip to visit her mother, he agrees, determined to do right by her for a change. But the journey by train is like a sprint through Hell, as an undetermined virus is infecting SCORES of Korean people. It's up to a select few, including father and daughter, to survive and make it to Busan, which is supposedly something of a safe zone.""Train to Busan"" is sometimes cartoonish and over the top, and does go on longer than is really necessary. The amount of time it takes for the virus to infect a bitten person varies depending on the needs of the screenplay. And writer / director Sang-ho Yeon isn't averse to succumbing to genre clichés, such as the one cowardly individual who will throw others to the wolves in order to buy himself more time. Fortunately, the director serves up a satisfying smorgasbord of carnage, and often gets by on pure showmanship. He also makes sure that the scenario retains its humanity, never letting the horror get completely out of control. His characters may sometimes be ridiculous, but he does give us some heroes for whom we can root. The performances range from reasonably sturdy to frenzied, and as a leading character Seok is a little unconventional, because he actually teaches his daughter to always look out for # 1 first, rather than be compassionate.Pretty slick filmmaking and generous doses of gore help to keep this from ever getting boring, plus Dong-seok Ma (the expectant husband Sang Hwa) is a fairly amusing badass type of guy.Seven out of 10.",Train to Busan

14,Uriah43,Stuck on a Train with Zombies and Nowhere to Escape,5,9 September 2017,"""Seok-woo"" (Yoo Gong) is a fund manager who spends all of his time at the office which has subsequently damaged his marriage beyond repair. As luck would have it, however, he happens to have his young daughter ""Soo-an"" (Su-an Kim) with him for a few days and to cheer her up agrees to accompany her on the morning train from Seoul to Busan to be with her mother. However, upon boarding the train they discover that a zombie apocalypse has just started in Korea and that they are trapped inside one of the passenger cars with no ability to escape. As a result the uninfected passengers are forced to band together to keep the determined zombies as bay. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was a fairly solid zombie film which emphasized the ultra-fast variety in lieu of the typical slow-moving type. Because of that the action is quite brisk which initially worked quite well for the majority of the film. Unfortunately, I must admit that the non-stop action tended to become somewhat tedious after a while. Likewise, the rather poor ending didn't exactly help in that regard either. In any case, as I stated earlier this was a decent zombie movie for the most part and I have rated it accordingly. Average.",Train to Busan
15,morrison-dylan-fan,Bullet Train Busan.,10,15 January 2017,"Talking to a fellow IMDber about what his top film of 2016 was,I got told about a tantalising Korean Horror epic that he had seen at a film festival. Deciding to hold a 2016 Horror double bill viewing this weekend (with the other being the gritty Brit zombie title The Girl with All the Gifts) I booked a ticket for the Busan train.The plot:Putting all his attention on work, Seok-Woo barely sees his daughter Su-an.Sick of hardly seeing her dad,Su-an demands Seok-Woo to take her to Busan,so that Su-an can spend her birthday with her mum/his ex- wife. Taking it on the chin,Seok-Woo books the tickets for him and his daughter. Just before the train departs,a convulsing women jumps on the train.Noticing a large bite mark,Seok-Woo,Su-an soon find their destination to change from Busan to a zombie apocalypse.View on the film:Spending (most) of a two hour running time on a train,writer/director Sang-ho Yeon turns down a comfy seat to lay the track for a white-knuckle ride. Drawn away from Anima for his live action debut,Yeon & cinematographer Hyung-deok Lee brilliantly close the passengers to the chaos on board with ultra-stylish claustrophobic shots,which look from above at the limited room the passengers have for zombie-free air. Mounting up the zombies,Yeon brilliantly chews practical,in-camera effects with CGI shrieks,howling from Yeon keeping the gore to a minimum,to instead carve out an anxiety-drench Horror atmosphere,spun from the disturbing fast/slow spider-like movement of the undead. Watching the world die out as they drive by,the screenplay by Yeon eats up spectacular horror set-pieces with precisely hit personal human tragedy. Taking pit stops on the way to the poetic final destination,Yeon rolls the zombies in with piles of them darting all over the empty stations,with the unlucky pick-ups the train makes leading to some tasty shocks. Looking in at every carriage,Yeon cleverly uses the sweet drama between Seok Woo and Soo-an (played by the fantastic Yoo Gong and Soo-an Kim) as a foundation to keeping a close watch at how everyone on the other carriages fight to keep the zombie train on track.",Train to Busan

Thrilling from start to finish with a little comedy and heart as well.I'm not one who looks to watch zombie flicks and this may be the first Korean film I've ever seen and I loved it. The pacing's non-stop and the emotional stuff isn't too much. How many people died because of that Yon-suk a-hole, he's hilarious. It's also about a man's journey in Seok-woo, becoming heroic and selfless, after witnessing those around him and his daughter in particular care for the welfare of others in a time of peril.",Train to Busan

19,trashgang,excellent effects makes it a must see,8,5 October 2016,"I was lucky to see this Korean zombie flick before it is shown in our regions on Halloween night. It's already out for months. And I must say that I really enjoyed this must see flick.Even as it clocks in at almost 2 hours it never had a boring moment. And it do has a few sentimental moments about losing the one you love. And even as the story isn't that strong it all works out fine. It's just a survival on the train that has some zombies running around.But what makes this flick watchable and above mediocre are the effects used. The zombies do react and move on a weird way, And in the beginning the deer standing up after being hit, wonderful. Also there's a lot of CGI used with collisions between trains but it all looks real. Even the horde smashing against each other it do works. For all zombie geeks a must see.

20,deloudelouvain,One of the better zombie movies,8,13 January 2017,"Second Korean movie that I watched this week and again it won me over. For a zombie movie, that has been done over and over again, this one is much better then most of the other zombie movies. With zombie movies you always get the same story with the same slow pasting zombies. In Busanhaeng though the zombies could compete with Usain Bolt over the 100 meters. They are fast and extremely aggressive. And that's only a positive thing for the suspense in a zombie movie. So it's absolutely not like in The Walking Dead where there they are literally just walking and a grandmother with a wooden leg could outrun them. I can't remember any name of the actors nor understand a word of what they saying but I have to admit that there are pretty good actors in Korea. Overall I would give this movie a seven star rating but as a movie in the zombie genre it deserves an eight because it's way better then other zombie movies. Great acting, a good story, fast aggressive and bloody action, you won't get bored for a second.",Train to Busan
21,christopher-underwood,"Brutal and visceral action combines with very subtle messaging to ensure the perfect ride, always assuming you are not on that Train to Busan",9,2 July 2020,"I guess this might be referred to as a 'popcorn movie' in as much as it doesn't set out to change the world but just entertain, trouble is I'm just not sure at what point you would have the time to grab a handful and amidst the mayhem there are moments of seriousness and cause for reflection, especially in the midst of our own, very real pandemic. Director Sang-ho Yeon was known for animated films before plunging into this immaculate and superior example of the action movie. There is a brief introduction with scenes of work and private life showing considerable signs of strain even before we plunge into the most devastating and excitingly constructed runaway train with zombies. I guess they are not really zombies but persons rapidly infected in such a way as to display zombie like symptoms. Cleverly we are introduced to the main characters and then shown in terrible and frightening clarity the bloody and warped reality of such a victim. Such is the detail and believability that when more and more and even more are so transformed we are only too aware of the detail. Indeed the director's animation background makes him perfect for using (I assume!) CGI in such imaginative and convincing ways we really believe piles of zombies and tumbling over each other like great waves of living dead. At two hours the film is just about right and I think, looking back, that the reason this almost single set film maintains its momentum so well is partly that it is so well shot. The imaginative use of the camera, as well as the editing, help enormously, as does the restrained but effective emotional involvement achieved through minimal but well judged dialogue between the main protagonists. Brutal and visceral action combines with very subtle messaging to ensure the perfect ride, always assuming you are not on that Train to Busan",Train to Busan
22,siderite,Really fun,8,25 December 2016,"I love Korean horror movies. Right when the action and horror is at its peak they insert this home like humor that makes you feel for the characters and understand that while the plot might be ridiculous, so is real life.This is not a comedy, like Gowemul, which I really liked, but has some of these moments that make it fun. The scene when the guy apologetically tells his pregnant wife ""Honey, can you run?"" while a horde of zombies approach was priceless.So, yeah, it's a zombie movie. And while it feels fresh, it's nothing you haven't seen before. It's Korean, so it has some specific idiosyncrasies and some of the jokes or social issues it hints at might pass over your head, but it's not that deep.I liked the actors, the kid was really good. The special effects were OK most of the time, but there was one ""explosion of zombies"" effect they used twice without it being needed and it looked kind of stupid. I liked the scene where the ""villain"" kind of explains how he feels and why he did the horrible and stupid things he did. It is important to care about your characters, including the bad guys and the sacrificial lambs. Americans might want to learn from that.Bottom line: I had a lot of fun watching it.

24,Hellmant,"It definitely deserves it's enormous Box Office success, and it's rave reviews.",9,17 March 2017,"'TRAIN TO BUSAN': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)A South Korean zombie apocalypse horror flick, about passengers on a train to Busan that are trying to survive a zombie outbreak. It was directed by Yeon Sang-ho (who's only previous experience is in writing and directing animated horror and thriller movies), and it was written by Park Joo-suk. The film stars Gong Yoo, Kim Su-an, Jung Yu-mi, Kim Eui-sung and Ma Dong-seok. It's received almost unanimously positive reviews from critics, and it was a blockbuster at the international Box Office (breaking multiple records). I really enjoyed it as well.Seok-woo (Yoo) is a divorced fund manager who's obsessed with his job and has made little time for his young daughter, Soo-ann (Su- an), in recent years. Seok-woo has promised to take Soo-ann to Busan, to see her mother, but of course things don't go as planned. A zombie outbreak spreads throughout the train, and seemingly everywhere in the area. Seok-woo, and his daughter, must work together with other passengers on the train, to survive the trip and hopefully make it somewhere safe. At the same time Seok-woo tries to prove to his daughter what a good father he can still really be (by becoming a badass zombie fighter).The film has some great special effects, and awesome (brutal) zombie action scenes. It's a great dark horror movie, with biting social commentary on the battle of the rich verses the poor (despite how cheesy it might sound). It's also a surprisingly emotional character study, with a pretty diverse (and well developed) group of characters. The film is a lot of fun, it's satisfying to horror fans, and it's even got some decent drama in it (and acting). I think it definitely deserves it's enormous Box Office success, and it's rave reviews.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/Y0XE5jyxMFQ",Train to Busan
25,thesar-2,Only Z this World War,8,2 October 2016,"While these aren't the zombies I'm looking for, the movie made up for every wrong-doing in World War Z.Train to Busan is an incredibly well-shot, well-acted and well-thought- out zombie/infected film with characters you care about, want to see grow and live. It might have had a low budget, but you'd never know it; this foreign film looked like a major Hollywood movie.Now, though the many scenes of heart, exposition, depth, setup and introduction to our ""heroes"" worked really well, the movie was terribly too long. I wasn't really complaining throughout for pacing or length, nor was I wondering if scenes could be cut, but it still went on far longer than it should have. It was almost as if there were 5-6 climaxes and then you realize you still have 45-25 minutes left.Also, and this is a personal preference, the zombies ran at Mach One speed. Sincerely, I love zombie shows and I'm a purist at heart. The slow, stumbling, ""yes, you can walk right past them"" kinds are what frighten me the most. The exception to the rule was 2004's Dawn of the Dead remake. They were fast, fine, but the movie's all-around greatness made me forget my hang-up on the bionic-beasts.And Train to Busan did the same thing. There was so much good here, the zombies were pretty much incidental to everything else I liked. Basically a divorced and selfish dad agrees to take his daughter to see her mom on a train when the 77,493th zombie-apocalypse begins. (That's not a complaint to how many there are, just a semi-fact. Still love this subgenre!) Unfortunately for the passengers, an infected, bitten, Walker, The Living Dead or Zombie – pick your poison, gets on board and all hell breaks loose. Unlike most of the Z movies, you will see characters grow and scenes so powerful, it'd be hard not to choke up. I certainly did. And though the film's not without the standard clichés and stereotypical evil/not-evil scared humans, it's easy to also get past those movie tropes since the actors are so strong and believable.I really, really did like this movie. If you're a fan of zombie flicks and require a lot more depth and sometimes humor, you cannot go wrong here.***Final thoughts: Day 2 Movie in the Can! I'm watching a NEW-2-ME horror movie every day of October 2016 and this one I've heard good things about. I actually put it off too long just to save for October. Wish I hadn't; not only was the movie great, it had some incredibly cute Asian men that I wouldn't mind finding more films with them in it.",Train to Busan
26,cherold,Beautifully done thrill ride,9,24 April 2019,"After telling my girlfriend that Train to Busan was an amazing movie, I found I couldn't quite tell her why. It doesn't really have any of those moments you talk about after or anything; it's a movie that's simply really engrossing and exciting on a minute-by-minute basis rather than one with amazing set pieces.It starts slowly, setting up a bunch of characters in a way that reminds me of 70s disaster movies like The Poseidon Adventure. A neglectful father and his young daughter, a couple of middle-aged ladies, a bunch of school kids, all taking a train trip. Then there's a sick passenger who comes back from the dead and suddenly a zombie virus is tearing through the train like wildfire.Trapped on a moving train, and seeing the outside world is also in the grip of zombies, a shrinking set of passengers fights for survival, beset by zombies as well as the worst of human nature.The movie is beautifully structured. There is a lovely compactness to the way characters are introduced; you quickly have a sense of who they are and become invested. The pace is fast and disasters come on on another like dominoes.It's not too gory, which is how I like my horror. It's really closer to something like The Birds or Jurassic Park, and is as much action and suspense as horror. You should watch it.",Train to Busan

28,Pjtaylor-96-138044,One of the best zombie movies of recent years.,8,12 May 2018,"'Train To Busan (2016)' is one of the best zombie movies of recent years, boasting a frenetic energy and the ability to create pulse-pounding tension thanks to an astute focus on fast-paced yet clear action sequences that feature several well-developed characters. Almost all of the primary passengers feel tangible and their relationships are expertly explored, leading to some truly emotional moments as well as constant audience attachment. This is what really elevates the piece above others in the genre. 8/10",Train to Busan
29,Cineanalyst,Zombies on a Train,7,13 April 2020,"The action of ""Train to Busan"" is so intense and the set-up excellent that the movie's faults may almost be overlooked. Others have, rightly, compared the fighting aboard a train, moving through carnage from car to car, to ""Snowpiercer"" (2013), also by Korean filmmakers and also including a heavy-handed message on socio-economic inequality. The cinematic potential of trains, which partly came of age along with motion pictures at the end of the 19th century, was realized early on, though: as coinciding movement with the Lumière brothers' ""Arrival of a Train"" (1896), as framing movement with the phantom-ride views that displayed shifting scenery from the point of view of a moving train, and, with action as a third layer of momentum, as early as Edwin S. Porter's ""The Great Train Robbery"" (1903). So, here, in ""Train to Busan,"" we have zombies instead of bandits. Zombies running down aisles after their fleshy prey, zombies seen outside shifting views from the windows, and zombies thrown into windows. Even the effects for their piling up when a large enough herd is in pursuit works well enough.The father-child dynamic is effective, too. But, the prospect of the fund manager investing in a company maybe responsible for the outbreak adds nothing. And, as if it weren't enough for this ""bloodsucker,"" as another, lower-class character (played by Ma Dong-seok, the most charismatic actor of the bunch) calls him--such terminology putting him in league with the flesh-eating zombies, to learn his lesson, to treat people with respect and egalitarianism, an insufferably irredeemable baddie is introduced. This leads to a contrived class structure between the train doors that's ridiculously oblivious to the undead threat surrounding them. Plus, there are other melodramatic contrivances and repetitions in the characters' quest for survival. As a zombie action flick, however, ""Train to Busan"" is, indeed, a thrill ride, and the ending nicely threatens a reference to that first modern zombie film, ""Night of the Living Dead"" (1968).",Train to Busan
30,cricketbat,A solid PG-13 foreign zombie flick,8,31 December 2018,"If you're looking for a solid PG-13 foreign zombie flick, Train to Busan is a great choice. It drags a bit at the beginning, but the undead are quick and horrifying, and the story keeps your adrenaline pumping once it gets going. It's not overly gory, either. This movie relies on the hopelessness of the situation to frighten you. I'd happily add this to my collection of zombie movies.",Train to Busan
31,Bored_Dragon,Good but overrated,7,23 November 2017,"When I sit to watch zombie movie I expect horror, action, maybe even comedy, I expect B production and certain level of frivolity. Instead, Train to Busan brings A production and very serious drama. Essentially, this is not a zombie movie. This is movie about human relations and what they become in state of panic. Story that is seen many times before, but it's usually placed in war or natural disaster surrounding, while here they placed it in zombie apocalypse. This is not original story, this is just somewhat original mash-up of pretty much outworn clichés. Mash-up of disaster drama and zombie apocalypse we already have in Walking Dead. Walking Dead + Snowpiercer = Train to Busan. So, it's definitely not original. Further, action part of the story is painfully dumb. again we have bunch of people acting stupid and illogical in order to stretch movie to two hours. Most obvious example are survivors piercing through wagons crowded with zombies. In every new wagon they find different way to get from back to front door, risking their lives again and again. The only goal of those inventive new solutions is to fill half of the movie with thrilling action, while there is simple, obvious and safe solution put aside as it does not exist. Simply tell driver to stop the train in next tunnel (cause zombies attack only people they clearly see), then leave the train through door, walk outside the train to desired wagon, enter it and journey can be continued. Logical, practical, safe, but also a scene that would last just a few minutes and deprived us of the most exciting part of the movie. Stupidity and illogicality in service of agony prolongation is something we are used to in most of horror movies, but in serious drama it simply doesn't hold. Technically and visually it's well done and personal drama is deep and strong, but overall this is unoriginal movie with stupid plot and bunch of redundant action. And it does not have even H of horror.6,5/10",Train to Busan
32,851222,Excellent,10,1 May 2017,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Train to Busan"" (2016) was hands down the most involving, intriguing, nail biting and visceral experience I've seen in many moons, considering this so called ""zombie"" genre. It has more in common with ""28 Days Later"" then G.Romero zombies and even ""World War Z"" influence is pretty obvious. But ""Train to Busan"" was by a moon better then ""World War Z"" - at running time 1 h 50 min. i wished it didn't ended and that happens rarely in movies these days. This is a superbly crafted picture from start till finish. The first ~50 min where nothing short of spectacular - great special effects, superbly constructed action / chase set piece at the station, clear character development and very clear and involving narrative. Second part of the film was just great - a nail biting horror / thriller. Overall, if you do like zombie movies - ""Train to Busan"" delivers goods - big time. This is one of the best if not the best example in this genre in some long time. I wasn't a sequel.",Train to Busan

34,nairtejas,Molecule Review: Train to Busan (6 Stars),6,24 November 2018,"Just like any other zombie film, Sang-ho Yeon's Train to Busan starts and ends like you would expect it to be unless you deep dive into the dialogues between the characters that create a much more emotional impact on you. There's a biomedical threat engulfing the city of Seoul and its neighboring areas when a selfish fund manager has to take his daughter to her mom (they are separated) in Busan. But they don't know what's coming to hunt them. How these two characters plus a bunch of other ones try to save themselves from the impulsive zombies forms the crux of this horror thriller that has some insane CGI work to keep you hooked. I watched the Hindi dubbed version (with English subtitles), so naturally the effect was a bit low if you are not a Korean native. But I found Train to Busan to be an emotional drama about relationships and their absence more than it is about a zombie apocalypse. You have to decide if that's a good thing or a bad thing. TN.",Train to Busan
35,The-Sarkologist,Worth Watching,7,9 August 2020,"I get the feeling that this is one of those 'must watch' films, even though I probably wouldn't set it apart from some of the really good films that I have seen in the past. Yet, in a way this film has a uniqueness that I really do appreciate, even though it is basically a zombie film. However, the scenes where the zombies are literally falling over each other in a massive horde really does make it pretty scary at times.Yet, a part of it also has a lot to do with the characters, and the various motives that each of them have. Further, considering that it is a zombie film, it is one of those 'last people standing' types, though you can pretty quickly work out who is going to remain standing at the end, namely because there seems to be this unwritten rule in films as to who is allowed to die, and who isn't.So, the film is about this Fund Manager who has to take his daughter to his ex-wife. They are in Soeul, and she is in Busan, which is basically the other side of Korea (and while the movie suggested that it was only an hour, I checked Google Maps and it suggests that the trip takes something like two-and-a-half hours). However, things really start going pear shaped as the train starts to take off. There are hints as to what is going on, but when it happens, it really happens thick and fast.I guess one of the key things about this film is how people react in moments of stress. Or moreso, how people act when the world starts collapsing around them. For instance, we have this struggle between doing the right thing for others, even though it might result in you suffering for it, or looking out for your own skin despite others suffering. The fact that the main character is confronted with this dilemma, and challenged throughout the film, is one of the things that really sets it apart.Another interesting thing to note is how being selfish can actually be a downfall in the end. For instance, in the scene where it is a choice between rescuing a couple of people, and saving themselves, their act to save themselves and let the others die results in all of them eventually dying. This also brings me to the point of how doors are used in this film. It may not seem like much, but in a way the question of survival really comes down to the use of doors, and whether you open them or not. Some are opened, others are broken down.I guess this is where the subtle references to class warfare come about, because the only reasons that there are classes is because there are doors, and these doors and closed and locked. Yet, in another sense this whole concept of class really only exists to keep the hordes at bay, and satisfied, since opening the door will result in you being overwhelmed. It is also interesting how in a group there always seems to be one who rises to the top, and then uses this position to further his own position, no doubt at the expense of others. It does show how fragile it really is, since all it takes is for one person to open the door, and everything comes crashing down.",Train to Busan

37,Reno-Rangan,Horror express.,8,24 January 2017,"A week ago I saw a zombie film from Japan called 'I Am a Hero' and now this Korean. I have not seen a quality zombie film at the recent time. The second tier films like 'Cooties', 'Freaks of Nature', 'Scouts Guide...', all these were comedies. Probably 'World War Z' was the last decent zombie film I have seen and after that this is the one. So the timing of the film was another advantage. Since there's no competition, this zombie film rules. And not to forget the Korean style, they are among the best thriller film makers today.Directed by an Anime filmmaker, this is his first live-action film. When I decided to watch it, I thought it would be another Korean film, which rely on father-daughter sentiments. You know I kind of tired of that Korean cliché where at the final stage they let the kid sob and call it a twist. Initially I enjoyed those and later on getting bored of that. With that kind of reasons, I would have missed it. Being a film fanatic, I won't mind to risk a watch, except give up writing a review for it.But in this case, it was completely different. Even the characters, any characters in the film, either in the lead or the supporting ones, all are unpredictable. That's the biggest plus point of the film. At the end you won't be sure, who you were rooting for. You know in those edgy scenes, we blindly back the one we like. You will think you can guess the upcoming scenes, but the writing was very smartly done. Feels like they did not care about a sequel, if this meets a greater success. But who knows, this is a cinema and there were many mysteries kept unsolved, so they can pick up from one of those loops.""Whatever you do, you must finish what you start. It's worse than not doing it at all.""This is the story of a divorced, workaholic father and his young daughter. After the progress, many others join them. On her birthday, they decide to visit her mother in Busan. On their train, soon after it took off, they come to know that something is wrong around. With all the chaos unrolling rapidly, a group of survivours gathers in a car since there's no escape as they are trapped in a moving train. How their journey ends, whether they reach a safe place with the fight against the living dead, the narration comes to halt.In the contest of good versus evil, there's no place for sentiments. But at one stage, near the end they cleared the place to attach one. In that final scene you can't resist, even if you are not an emotional person when it comes to the film. As I mentioned earlier that is the part I feared the most would come, but i did not hate it in the context of story development. Because that was a perfect setting to take the story to the next level. There are several twists. Those are from the film characters' perspective than the story wise. They did not bother to tell about the cause of the epidemic. Instead, this film was focused on the train passengers and their fight for survival when the defending options are limited. Just imagine it is a zombie version of another Korean film 'Snowpiercer' or like 'Snakes on a Plane'.I have heard there's another film, an animation which is also directed by the same filmmaker and said to be a prequel to this one. If you had liked it, you would be itching to watch that one as well. Hope I would watch it as soon as I get an opportunity. So, my view on it, the film is very good. It was close to two hours long, but once the train journey begins, you won't going to notice the time. I am saying the pace of the film, as well as the events make you dissolve in it completely and forget everything else. This is the best zombie film right now and you should not miss it, especially if you like this theme. Recommended!8/10",Train to Busan

40,tomgillespie2002,"In a time of zombie overkill, Train to Busan still manages to feel fresh",7,6 August 2017,"Train to Busan, Sang-ho Yeon's hugely successful South Korean zombie movie, may just be the most effortlessly enjoyable action movie to feature the brain-hungry undead in years. Taking inspiration from the maestro who created the 'zombie' we know and love today, the late, great George A. Romero, as well as Danny Boyle's faster and scarier flesh-eaters, it's a wonderfully constructed and nail- bitingly tense piece, which manages to mix action, horror and a bit of family drama into two hours of pure entertainment. It also finds time to deliver a message amidst the carnage, and one that is perhaps more relevant than ever in these unpredictable times. In the most hopeless of situations, we must ultimately look out for one another if we are to stand a chance of surviving. Train to Busan condemns those who are willing to sacrifice others to save their own necks.Workaholic fund manager Seok-woo (Yoo Gong) is the kind of father who always seems to be on his phone at important family events. Divorced and single, he occasionally looks after his young daughter Soo-an (Su-an Kim) in the apartment he shares his mother, but pays such little attention to the girl that he buys her a Nintendo Wii for her birthday, forgetting that he got her the same present the previous year. What she really wants for her birthday is to see her mother in Busan, but Seok-woo is so busy at work that he is unable for find the time to accompany her on the 2 hour round-trip. After taking some advice from his mother, he eventually agrees. They arrive at the train station safe and sound, but it's clear that something isn't quite right. Police and ambulance sirens whizz by, people are running in the street, and the news reports show mass unrest and rioting across the country.Before the train doors shut however, a sickly woman gets on board. She soon collapses and starts to convulse, only for a poor train attendant to tend to her and wound up bitten. It's a big train however, and Train to Busan starts to clearly establish the collection of characters on board. There's a tough husband and his pregnant wife, two elderly sisters, a young cheerleader, a rich and selfish corporate type, and an entire baseball team, who are handily packing many bats in their luggage. Panic soon sets in as the realisation of a zombie apocalypse dawns on the passengers, and with much of the country either in quarantine or overrun by the military trying to fight off the unstoppable hoard, its unclear just where and when they can stop. Seok-woo's intentions are to look out only himself and his daughter, and teaches the seemingly wiser Soon-an the same. But as the situation becomes increasingly dyer, it becomes clear that they are stronger together.The atmosphere and tension are turned up to the max during some incredibly inventive set-pieces, which often make the most of the most mundane of locations. These are the running, screeching zombies of Danny Boyle's 28 Days Later, so cramped train carriages are quickly turned into narrow isles of death. As the passengers learn the zombies' weaknesses, such as their inability to work out a door handle or how they quickly forget about you once you're out of site, the darkness of long tunnels become their ally as they journey from A to B. Sang-ho Yeon is careful to keep the social commentary at the fore, highlighting how fear can turn the nicest of people into selfish, despicable monsters, and how important it is to fight out primal instincts in moments of terror. After a fast-paced first hour, the events become somewhat repetitive and the running time could do with some trimming, but it all pays off with a gripping climax. In a time of zombie overkill, Train to Busan still manages to feel fresh.",Train to Busan
41,TheMovieDiorama,Train to Busan is easily one of the best modern zombie thrillers.,8,27 February 2018,"Flipping heck this was an emotional rollercoaster. It's a simple formulaic plot: we follow a family or group of people, a viral outbreak occurs, lots of biting and blood whilst ending with some sacrifices. ""Go! Save yourselves! I'll hold them off""...y'know, that kind of heroism. We've seen it all before. What makes this refreshing and exciting is the actual emotional connection we form with the characters. They aren't all just expendable, they do indeed have some soul. A struggling father to a daughter, a pregnant woman with her devoted partner, a young loved up couple...and a COO of a massive company. Before I begin, I have to let off some steam. The COO was the biggest (try not to swear!)...ummm...coward ever (phew...that'll do). He absolutely boiled my blood. Infuriated the flip out of me. I stood up and simply shouted ""SOMEONE KILL HIM ALREADY!?"". Yet somehow I related to him. In fact I related to most of the characters, they each had individual strands of different personalities that made the plot compelling. It's about self-sacrifice and willing to help others rather than being selfish. Our lead character undergoes this transformation exquisitely, the pressure of survival moulded him into a better human being. It isn't just ""oh my God zombies, let's run this way!!"" (although that is present), there's some heart within the frantic action which I found to be admirable. Extremely well paced for a two hour flick, didn't get bored once. The makeup for the infected looked authentic. Plenty of blood, dark veins and a really nice touch with the grey eyes. I was on the edge of my seat on multiple occasions particularly during the chase scenes. The cinematography was clean and sharp, incredible picture quality. I did find the visual effects to be below average, especially fires or breaking of glass. CGI zombies are kept to a minimal but is unfortunately used. Also punching the infected just relinquishes the fear of them, I was no longer scared of them. However, a damn entertaining train ride.",Train to Busan
42,Tweetienator,Good but no Masterpiece,6,12 September 2016,"Lots of praise by other reviewers so I will play the advocatus diaboli here - Train to Busang is a good flick with fast running zombies/infected like portrait in 28 Days later etc. A couple of ppl are in a train as the outbreak hits the nation (South Korea). The fight of these survivors on the train and on some stations is the main plot, centered around a father and his little daughter and a man and his pregnant wife as the main heroes. I liked the movie - camera, acting everything is pro but the movie lost for me a lot cuz some figthing scenes were just not well executed - for example three guys fighting with baseball bats and fists their way through train wagons filled with dozens of infected. No bite, no blow, no wound, it's just simply impossible, it looks like a little bit of a Chackie Chan movie here - trained forces with guns etc. turned cuz they their overruned by the infected but our heroes just get them down with one fist-punch... If u ever had to fight with a mad guy you know what a strength such a man can execute even if you are of more strength and weight. Also the gore level is for my taste rather low - lots of blood yes, but no limbs or guts etc. flying around or flesh bitten out by hungry maniacs etc. So yes, this movie is far far better as all those wanna-be zombie flicks from pseudo-filmmakers with no talent and/or budget but can't beat the elite movies of this genre: a good movie but not in all aspects (some terrible hollow Asian drama scenes) really convincing and in no way the ""best zombie movie ever"" like some other reviewers stated.",Train to Busan

47,imseeg,"Has the look and feel of a B movie, but this zombie movie turns out to be a rather good one. Great frenzy and gore. Riveting suspense and unnerving fight for survival.",7,17 February 2019,"Didnt expect much of it at first. Looked like a cheap B movie, because of the low budget for special effects. But that low budget for special effects turns out to be a good thing, because what we get instead of boring CGI effects is great real life mass pursuits of zombies. And instead of boring CGI we get a lot of real life unnerving close up fights for survival with zombies in a high speed train.Yes, the bloody zombies dont look particularly convincing, but their frenzy is terrific nonetheless. Yes, for those nitpickers who complain about apparent loopholes in the story, there are indeed some, but they dont affect the movie's suspense. The actors arent particularly great either, but their characters are quite convincing nonetheless.Despite all these minor let downs I got really swept away with this suspenseful story about a korean dad, who wants to protect his young daughter from zombie attacks on a train. The ""zombies on a train"" theme is rather interesting as well. All in all a really surprising, enjoyable and even emotionally touching zombie movie. 7 stars, but I will upgrade to 8 stars if this movie still stands strong after a second viewing.",Train to Busan
48,Vartiainen,Exhilarating Day One zombie movie,8,1 April 2020,"Train to Busan is a story about a group of random people that are on their way to Busan in South Korea when the zombie virus breaks loose and people start to turn. The movie is nothing more than their desperate struggle to survive through the initial onslaught and make it to safety. But it excels at just that, being nail-bitingly intense, legitimately scary and surprisingly touching on character level.First of all, the zombies are great. Full of props to the actors and the special effects team for their work, because not only were these zombies scary on a conceptual level - turning in an instant and being blindingly fast and strong - but they were also played superbly and looked horrifying.Secondly, the script is great. Day One zombie movies are often rather similar in their plots, and as such there's an art to doing it in a way that feels new and novel. And this movie certainly does that. I also really liked the characters and their interactions. Rarely have I cared as much about the survivors in a zombie film as I've cared about these people. Our nominal main characters, the father and daughter, and their character arcs were especially heart-wrenching.Lastly, the directing. Yeon Sang-ho has a superb grasp on when to rush the plot along and when to give us a moment to breathe. It's an intense movie where there's always danger and something happening, but we still have these moments to get to know our characters and come to care about them. Or hate them, depending. The worst threats in a zombie apocalypse are often the other survivors, after all.Fantastic film. One of the best zombie films I've seen in years. One of the best horror films in general, as well, for that matter. Recommended.",Train to Busan

50,subxerogravity,Zombies on a train!? Boss!,7,31 July 2016,"We're leaving (leaving) on that Zombie Train to Busan (leaving on the undead train).Use to seeing Korean horror films about ghost, but Zombies!? This was refreshing.So this neglectful dad tries to make amends with his daughter by riding with her on the train (which she wanted to go by herself) to take her back to his ex-wife. Lucky for both of them as a zombie outbreak happens while their on the train. Now, their only hope for survival is to make it to the Busan stop.You really can't go wrong with a Zombie movie. It's rare that I've have seen one that I did not like. Train to Busan is definitely a good one too. Its filled with interesting characters. Other than the father daughter team, the train is also occupied by a pregnant women and her Macho and humorous husband, a school girl and her baseball playing boyfriend and some homeless wonderer who saw the outbreak first hand, just to name a few. The social commentary speaks on what you are made of as an individual and as a society with the best and the worse coming out of everyone during this crisis.I loved how relentless and aggressive the Zombies were. More like 28 days later than Romero. The special effects do get a little cartoony with zombies that seem to come form nowhere piling over one another like poring cereal into a bowl or something, but it does give you that man, these guys are screwed feel. Train to Busan focus on the idea that the walking dead sense you through sight and sound. If they can not see you or hear you they have no way of knowing your living flesh is a foot away from their hunger. It made for some cleaver obstacles when a group of passengers have to maneuver through train cars filled with zombie passengers (Sounds like the next game in the Resident Evil franchise).Also found it interesting that no zombies were shot in this picture. I don't know how Korean gun control laws work, but I can assume it's strict enough that the story would make no sense if someone on the train just happen to have one for zombie killing (unlike an American movie in which the unborn child having a gun would be fine so long as it moved along the story). Definitely a rarity in a Zombie picture and it worked.It's Action packed, it's humorless, with incredible looking zombies and a cast of characters so lively you give a crap what happens to them in the end. http://cinemagardens.com/",Train to Busan

A little girl who is so cute and I love her perfect adorable voice wants to go to mom's for her birthday. Dad got her a gift she already has. The girl lives with her dad and grandma.The two of them board the train and we see various stereotypical types of people - the jocks, the cheerleader, the elderly sisters, the hurrying man in a suit, the conductor, stewards, etc.The girl from Wonder Girls comes on the train to the pleasant excitement of the boys in their baseball jackets and bats. She sits next to one of them.The little girl is innocent and does what is morally correct. Dad tells her that in these situations it's every man for himself but she still wants to be the nice girl. The little girl associates with the other passengers notably the pregnant woman and her husband and the two elderly women who she gives a seat to.The man points at his wife's belly and says, ""I made that."". His wife gives him a look and he says it is true.Information is scattered, no one really knows what is really going on and the government isn't informing in detail. It is literally Darwin's theory about whomever is competent survives. Physical strength, quick running, attention is all tested in fighting and running from the zombies and not being bitten by one.The little main group comprises of Gong Yoo and his daughter, one elderly sister, the pregnant woman and her husband, and the cheerleader's crush. I love this group but they die off one by one, turning into zombies. We see a selfish man, the hurrying one who only cares about himself convince the crowd to block the door for our main group.

I watched an English subtitled version, but thought that the cast was very good, especially 10-year old Kim Su-an as Su-an and Gong Yoo as Seok-woo, her fund-manager father who is forced to re-examine his values in light of the grisly apocalypse. The film is somewhat uneven in the capacities of the hyper-animated corpses to absorb punishment but otherwise the story holds together pretty well (considering the premise is a communicable agent that near instantaneously turns a bitten person into a milky-eyed, frenetic cannibal). Well-made and smoothly directed, 'Train to Busan' is an entertaining entry into a generally bloated genre and impressively for a zomboid film, pulls off affecting, almost moving, ending.",Train to Busan
53,kevin_robbins,One of the better recent zombie films.,9,1 July 2021,"Train to Busan (2016) is a movie my fiancée and I watched together on Netflix. The storyline follows a zombie outbreak and a father and daughter's escape from a city and onto a train. The storylines continues with how the train deals with it's world around them and the father's commitment to the daughter's survival. This movie is directed by Sang-ho Yeon (Train to Busan Presents: Peninsula) and stars Gong Yoo (Guardian: The Lonely and Great God), Yu-mi Jung (Our Sunhi) and
Ma Dong-seok (Eternals). The storyline for this is very compelling and way better than it should be. The audience becomes very invested in the characters and you can't wait to see what they do next. The acting is very good and the daughter/father bond is well portrayed and delivered. The zombies sequence are also well done and you feel the intensity of the scenes. I would strongly recommend this movie and score it a 9/10. One of the better recent zombie films.",Train to Busan
54,parry_na,Spoilers follow ...,7,16 March 2017,"This begins with one of the best pre-credit scenes I've seen in a while, featuring a deer knocked down and apparently killed by a flustered van driver. Moments later, the crumpled body in the road judders back into life, struggling to stand. As it does so, we see its eyes – dead and milky. The creature has joined the ranks of the living dead! Next we meet sulking child Soo-an (Kim Su-an), who is upset because her father Seok-woo (Gong Yoo) works all the time and spends no time with her. I have a problem with this kind of thing, and other similar scenes in other films. Perhaps the child would be less brattish if the parents gave up work and instead of a WII (or two) to play with, she had a stick and a clementine. Hardly! ""Dads get all the bad rap and no praise,"" says big soft husband Sang-hwa (Dong-seok Ma) at one stage. Seok-woo, however, has his own story to tell  Anyway, this distant father and child are but two passengers who board the train to Busan, amid news reports of violence and rioting in the streets, and also a wayward passenger exhibiting symptoms of a strange and deadly disease.And we're off. Whilst the rapid transformations of many passengers into zombies relies perhaps too heavily on the actors' facial mannerisms and comes across often as 'over-enthusiastic' acting, there's no denying the effect of an enclosed body of people reverting into killers in some tensely choreographed scenes.My favourite character might well be Michael Ripper-like Yon-suck (Kim Eui-sung), self-serving CEO who does everything, and betrays everyone, in order to survive amidst the spitting, fast-moving zombie creatures. In one of my favourite scenes, the ringtone of a mobile phone in another carriage is used to successfully deflect the attentions of the ravenous pack. Watching them charging as one toward the source of the sudden, tinny music, is very effective.Every possible drop of tension is wrung out into the running time. For a while whilst watching 'Last Train to Busan', I felt there was something holding it back from greatness. Brilliant direction, acting and urgent pacing – however, I couldn't get completely immersed in it. And then, somewhere along the way, that changed and I was hooked. The tension is impossible to resist. What a journey!",Train to Busan

57,kluseba,The best zombie movie ever made so far,10,25 January 2017,"There have been numerous stereotypical, repetitive and gruesome zombie movies since the beginning of the millennium and now South Korea has officially jumped on the bandwagon... and revolutionized the entire genre with the very best movie of its kind.""Train to Busan"" convinces on every single level. The settings are diversified and very well chosen and the gripping atmosphere is pushed forward by the idea of a few random passengers being caught on a train with a horde of zombies. The cinematography is perfectly balanced between intense close-ups and larger angles. There are almost no shaky camera passages as opposed to the disappointing contemporary Hollywood standard. The story finds the right path between brutal intensity and great acting skills. The film is never slowing down and highly intriguing from the very first until the very last scene.What really makes this zombie movie stand out even compared to the better genre flicks is the depth and diversity of the intriguing characters that are perfectly portrayed by skilled actresses and actors. We get to meet a busy and divorced hedge fund manager and his estranged daughter who is desperately trying to get his attention. We follow the actions of a tough, honest and brave working-class man and his more serious pregnant wife. We are introduced to two old sisters with an intense connection who are inseparable. We meet a naive cheerleader and the baseball player she has a crush on and witness how they mature and become adults within just a few hours. The movie also has a strong antagonist in form of a pitiless chief executive officer who will do anything to survive. I have rarely watched a movie with so many addicting, authentic and profound characters. A special shout- out goes to child actress Kim Su-an who is more convincing in her role in this single film than many ambitious adult actresses in Hollywood in their entire careers.One has to be aware of the fact that this isn't a Hollywood movie. This movie doesn't try to be politically correct by adding a character of each possible visible minority in the world to the cast but we get a refreshingly realistic portrait of South Korean citizens fighting for survival instead. The film doesn't have a deeper philosophical meaning or tries to explain the zombie outbreak in melancholic images and words because this movie simply focuses on the dangerous situation where the characters don't have any time to over-analyze the situation. The sympathetic heroes of the story won't necessarily survive at the end of the movie and the last half hour includes several shocking and heartbreaking moments that will get you emotionally involved without being pathetic.In the end, there isn't anything negative to say about this movie that mixes horror, drama and action elements to what might be the best zombie movie of all times. If you haven't watched this movie, you have missed out on one of the greatest movies of the past few years. Along with the stunning South Korean horror film ""The Wailing"", the epic ""Train to Busan'' is the best film of the year 2016.",Train to Busan

A Bond Trader is taking his young daughter to his estranged wife in Busan when the Zombie outbreak occurs. These are fast zombies who bite and chomp and swiftly turn their victims into the undead. A School Baseball team use their bats to good effect. Some social commentary as well which would be worthy of Ken Loach but its not laid on with a trowel.The Zombie action works well and we mostly encounter fresh Zombies as they haven't had time to deteriorate.

61,3xHCCH,More Than Just a Zombie Film,10,5 September 2016,"This new Korean film ""Train to Busan"" is certainly earning a lot of positive word of mouth and box office success since its debut in the Midnight Screenings section of this year's Cannes Film Festival.The central character is Seok-woo, a man stressed out with problems about his investments business and his divorce. His 9-year old daughter Su-an, feeling neglected, requests her father to bring her to Busan the next day to see her estranged mother. Seok-woo could not say no.On the same train to Busan as Seok-woo and Su-an, a lady passenger with a bite wound on her legs, collapses and turns into a zombie. As she bites another person, that next person would also turn into a zombie and so on. Panic ensues on the train, and as everyone eventually discover along the way that the same zombie frenzy was true for the rest of the country. The fight to survive is now on.This film was one exhilarating roller-coaster ride from beginning to end. The zombies and their attack scenes were very well-executed with a combination of practical and computer-generated effects. These monsters were very fast-moving and relentless in their quest for human flesh. We hear people around us gasp and shriek with shock as we see these zombies pile up in droves and hordes, crash out of windows and barrel through doors. We breathlessly hang on to the edge of our seats the whole ride.Of course, what Korean film does not have a good dose of melodrama? The father-daughter dynamic between Seok-woo and Su-an is front and center. But aside from them, we also meet a cast of supporting characters on the train whose fates we will be following for the rest of the film. These include a burly man with his pregnant wife, a teenager with his girlfriend and his baseball team, a haughty businessman, two elderly sisters and a homeless man, among others. We get just enough introduction about who they are for us to care about what happens to them.Gong Woo played the flawed lead character Seok-woo very well. He was able to convincingly portray the development of this uncaring apathetic guy into a hero we could all root for to get through this crisis alive. He was as good in the weepy dramatic scenes as he was in the swashbuckling action scenes. This actor has come a long way since his breakout role as lead star of the TV romantic comedy series ""The Coffee Prince"" back in 2007.Kim Su-an is only 10 years old but she had already been acting in films for five years now. She is the dramatic core of this film as the daughter desperately reaching out to her jaded father. As a child actress, she held her own impressively among this cast of veterans with her heartfelt portrayal. Who would have thought that the sad little song she wanted to sing for her father would resonate so much?Ma Dong-seok is charismatic as Sang-hwa, a devoted husband and selfless fighter. We see him first as some sort of comic relief only, which made the audience warm up to him. Later, we would discover how much more his character was able to do and give for others, and loved him more. His pregnant wife Seong-kyeong was played by acclaimed Korean indie film actress Jung Yu-mi, conveying strength in her delicate condition. Another actor of note is Kim Eui-sung, who was totally hateful in his role as the selfish Yong-suk. In total contrast to Sang-hwa, Yong- suk was a man only thought of himself alone, not caring that he actually put a lot of other characters directly into harm's way.Ahn So-hee (as Jin-hee) and Choi Woo-shik (as Young-guk) were in there to inject some teenage romantic angst into the film. They were relatively lightweight performers who were probably included just because they looked cool. That scene when Young-guk encounters his baseball teammates-turned-zombies was very well-conceived by the writers. People may dismiss as ""just"" being a zombie film, but it is the drama of human relationships and interactions that rises above the horrific and thrilling carnage. Director Yeon Sang-ho's first two feature- length films (""The King of Pigs"" and ""The Fake"") were both animated films exploring the bleak side of human nature. With his first live action directorial effort, Yeon has created a complete film masterpiece with ""Train to Busan."" Highly recommended! 10/10.",Train to Busan

63,TdSmth5,Not that good,5,15 August 2017,"A farmer is stopped at some decontamination checkpoint. There's some leak at a biotech plant.Next we meet the boss of some investment firm. He's of course too busy to pay attention to his young daughter who wants to visit her mom in Busan. The dad finally agrees and they make it to the train station. On they way there's something going on, lots of emergency vehicles are driving somewhere. As the train departs zombies attack the train station and one actually makes it on the train.This zombie attacks some train attendant who bites another one and so on. Here the transformation into a zombie is near instantaneous. Depending on the needs of the script it may happen right away or it may take a minute or two. When eventually the passengers catch on what is going on, they run to the front of the train while the zombies end up in the rear. But by now the condition is spreading all over South Korea. The train isn't allowed to stop somewhere, communications are interrupted.We meet several characters: a pregnant woman and her tougher husband, two older women, a young baseball team, an even more arrogant and selfish business guy, and the train conductor.They do stop in some town where people would be quarantined by the military. But when they arrive and leave the train the military personnel is also infected. So it's back on the train but this time a group is in the back another in the rear. The ones in the back--our heroes--have to make it to the front where people are so freaked out they won't let them in.Things get grimmer and we'll have to see who actually survives this disaster as they get closer and closer to Busan.Train to Busan is a long, slow, melodramatic thriller with zombies piled up--I guess that's going to be the new trend thanks to World War Z, piles and piles of quick zombies. Despite the penchant for drama there's little dialogue and the characters' behavior often doesn't make a whole lot of sense mainly because for some reason they have nothing to say to each other. The zombie action is quick, somewhat unclear, individual zombies matter little but masses of zombies falling out of train cars like cockroaches are emphasized. None of it is particularly scary or frightening, which it should be given that the humans in a train have only two places to go- to the front or to the back. There's not a whole lot of gore or violence. What is good though is the setting of a zombie movie in a train; and I also liked that the movie takes place mostly during the day.It's surprising that while this movie does point out the soullessness of business people it also makes one of them the hero. We do get some sense of Korean values--rigidity, deference to authority, overemphasis on education as a solution to all ills.I can't quite understand the high score of this movie.

Unfortunately, the train has a number of folks who are slowly turning intro zombies, so the survivors aboard the train find themselves having to fight their way through the infected cars to get to the safe ones. This story may sound similar to ""Snowpiercer,"" but ""Train to Busan"" lacks that film's smart political subtext. ""Train to Busan"" is simply trying to entertain and it does quiet successfully achieve that with tons of fast zombie action, some interesting set pieces, and solid special effects, which is all fine and good if you're into zombie movies. On the downside, I'm not a fan of fast zombies and prefer the slow lumbering Romero-zombies, just as I also prefer my zombie films to have a Romero-style political subtext.

I don't think I reacted quite how the director wanted me to react during that last act.This is a fascinating premise. A zombie outbreak that leaks onto a train (with just one infected), and these are ""World War Z"" running, 15 seconds to turn (usually) zombies. I'm staunchly against running zombies, but when you do something well, it is really hard to discredit you for it.There is one aspect that is truly odd for zombies, but it would be quite the spoiler, it's basically the 3rd act (out of 4). The writing structure feels very different, it doesn't seem to adhere to a 3 act staple: it really feels like 4 acts broken into chapters (or levels similar to a video game) and as whichever characters survive the transfer from chapter to chapter, the story progresses. There is clearly though pre-infection establishing act, post infection establishing act, confrontation act, and resolution act. Once you get past the first act, it's pretty much non-stop action, by the by.The one frustrating part about this movie is that most of the characters seem to have a death wish: despite trying to stay alive, they all seem to want to die. I understand that a story can't happen without flawed characters, but the things these people do are so remarkably stupid sometimes that the zombies become more believable at times. It does allow for some of the more amazing scenes though, so it might be somewhat forgiveable.This movie is honestly so good, I really feel like I'm reaching on any of the complaints.",Train to Busan

The doom-laden drama begins immediately after an allegedly benign chemical spill, along with massive civil unrest increasing exponentially there are wild & woolly reports of rioting across the country, and as the societal collapse swiftly spreads, various amusingly stock characters board the last train to darksvillle, along with one recently infected soul, who proceeds with laudable alacrity to scurrilously spread this especially vicious, bloodily viscous, universally eye-bleaching, zombie-making contagion! Unthinkingly aggressive, pack-like, dangerously nimble, this ferociously fleet-footed legion of relentlessly single-minded, flesh-craving savages makes for an especially unruly morass of terminally toxic humanity, and it will take all the available brawn, guile and collective humanity of our hastily organised zombie-resistance squad. A boisterous teenaged baseball team, an especially muscle-bound, Bolo Yeung-esque pugilist and his bulbously pregnant wife, a deliciously despotic, self-serving C.E.O, two immaculate, sit-com ready, octogenarian ladies plus the glacially aloof, hedge fund-manipulating estranged father of an implausibly cute, 'Spielbergian kid' desperately stave off this hellacious horde of hastily reanimated death, as their terror-beleaguered train wends its tumultuous 453 km journey to the hoped-for sanctuary of far flung, Busan. While the flighty film's non-stop, claustrophobic hysteria is frequently distracting, there's a singular sentimentality which felt incongruent; especially the existential, Dickensian emancipation of our handsome, young, estranged father protagonist, dramatically turning from callous, money-hungry 'Scrooge' to empathic, zombie-slaying super-dad! Another niggling irritant was the inevitable repetition of frequently frantic, door-fumblingly, 'oh-so narrow' escapes by our preternaturally plucky, carriage-bound protagonists, but, curiously, while only running at a lean 113 minutes, this celluloid exodus dragged on a wee bit, and could have richly benefited from some judicious editing, excising much of the saccharine sentimentality and enlivening the rather pedestrian script with additional fright-leavening flourishes of zesty repartee would have sped things along nicely, as more than once I could hear myself wearily ask the overwrought driver, 'are we were there yet?' 'Train to Busan' is a mixed bag o' rotten bones, while extraordinarily polished and well made, its momentary lapses of déjà vu, the timorous lack of practical gore FX and the film's grisly excesses of Spielbergian soul searching, perhaps, making this particular zombie apocalypse far more suitable entertainment for mainstream audiences than jaded, hardcore horror fans like me!",Train to Busan

This is much better than Snowpiercer, and conveys the zombie satire of society every bit as well as Romero. Plus the emotional moments are truly good. Plenty of humour, but no laughs for me - all in the translation, except the final scene was crying out for a close up on the sniper's face as he heard the singing.Performances are good, with an impressive turn by the little girl.Music, editing - good.

74,mhorg2018,One of the most unique Zombie movies ever,8,10 March 2017,"When I first heard of this, I sighed. Now Zombies on a train? But this is a really different film that shows the best and worst of humanity while trying to survive. When an outbreak of violence starts sweeping South Korea, A father (who has little time for her) and his daughter are, with others including a working man and his pregnant wife, a High School Baseball team and a CEO (the one stereotype in the movie) on a train. Before the train can leave, an injured woman staggers on. As the trains pulling out we see others attacked on the platform. For now the travelers are blissfully unaware... This is anything but an average zombie movie. Some may compare it to 28 Days Later (but those weren't zombies, they were infected and living). The zombies in this are unique in ways that I won't give away. They share more of a kinship with the terrible World War Z (this is a hundred times better)in their swarming ways. I would have thought that a movie set nearly entirely on a train would be slow, possibly boring - but it's not. Between moving at breakneck speed, this movie is claustrophobic and creepy. Well worth seeing.",Train to Busan
75,Muhammad_Rafeeq,( South korean A+ Movie) My Ratings 9/10,9,10 March 2020,A zombie film that is very surprisingly good. The train set up is a great set piece and makes you feel slightly claustrophobic which helps add to the tension. Some real interesting characters that you want to have a connection towards. If you don't mind reading subtitles and like zombie films then give this one a shot. I guarantee you won't be disappointed.,Train to Busan
76,Abdulxoxo,Train to disaster,5,22 August 2020,"*zombie about to bite a main character*Main character: but I'm the main characterZombie: ohh yeah rightttttMain character: yeahhhhZombie: understandable. Have a great day. 🤙
I mean come on, whenever it was the main character the zombies suddenly changes their behavior, slow when they are needed to be slow, fast when they're needed to fast. I'm not impressed with some of the acting, their reaction doesn't go with situation at hand. I mean some of them saw an actual zombie eating someone but their facial expression is as if that person is looking at a wall. And we didn't get an actual explanation as to how the virus got out in the first place, we were just told that it started from a biotech comp - not enough!Why were they at first mocking the lead character for being selfish eg for closing the door before the couple enter and the guy even said "" I ThInk YoU ArE OwE Us aN aPoLoGy"" like seriously?, I mean he was being selfish at an acceptable level considering their situation. Talking about selfish, there was this other guy he was self-centered almost to the point of being annoying. I believe he's the second bad guy right?
And why do people 'change' to zombie at different rate, one guy got bitten it took him only seconds to change but when it's the main characters they have a minute or two to say some few lines before they change.
What teen girl are the other reviewers talking about? I mean I didn't even notice anything worth mentioning there. I remembered she was there after seeing some of the reviews lol.
The movie is entertaining tho. it's non - stop action from beginning to end but that's just it.",Train to Busan
77,Troy_Campbell,Adds a lot of spark to the zombie genre.,8,12 August 2016,"This lively South Korean zombie flick arrives in Oz with a limited release, which is a pity as it's a riotous adventure filled to the brim with action, gore and damn interesting story beats. Like all good films within this subgenre, the narrative is rife with metaphors about modern day issues (parent-child connections, corporate greed, human interaction, etc) but it also provides a compelling survival plot when taken at face value. The core relationship between Yoo Gong's self-centred businessman and his quiet, emotionally-neglected 9-year-old daughter (Soo-an Kim – a tour de force) is riveting as it gets put through the wringer, never feeling anything less than authentic. There are spurts of melodrama, however, that induce the odd unintentional chuckle, whilst a select few from the supporting cast play up their stereotypes – love-struck school girl, despicable scaremonger, muttering homeless man – a little too much. Sang-ho Yeon directs with unabashed gusto, pumping up tension and thrills though a string of adrenaline-pumping set pieces, an amazing train-station sequence that turns from hopeful to deadly being a particular high point. The undead are suitably grotesque and enjoyably expendable, their physical movements a mix between the 28 Days Later mode of rapid flesh-eaters and the herky-jerky twitches of J-horror ghosts, although the rules for how quickly someone becomes ""infected"" seems to vary depending on plot requirement. It doesn't necessarily bring anything new to the zombie genre, but with a bunch of exhilarating set pieces and a willingness to kill off anyone at anytime, Train to Busan certainly adds a whole lot of spark.",Train to Busan

79,Prashast_Singh,Train to Busan Review: An impressive action thriller with surprisingly amazing display of emotions!,10,27 February 2017,"Movie: Train to Busan (A) (Why, CBFC India?)Rating: 5/5To be very honest, I had never watched a zombie film in my entire life. I had heard about such films and also realized that mostly Hollywood produces such films. TRAIN TO BUSAN is an exceptional addition not just to the list of the best zombie apocalypse action thriller, but also to the list of best films of world cinema which portray human emotions in the most realistic and heart-touching way possible. Yes, it's that excellent. TRAIN TO BUSAN is the first South Korean film to have a wide theatrical release in India. That attracted too. It was released in India in English, Hindi, Tamil and Telugu. I watched the film first in Korean with English subtitles, and then in Hindi. And I realized that the film manages to convey its message and make you reciprocate emotionally for the film, whether you watch the dubbed version or the original version. The Hindi dubbing was good enough to add to the positive feel.The art South Korean filmmakers know is how to add an emotional feel to different genres. Thus, TRAIN TO BUSAN is no exception as it makes you feel for every character. Gong Yoo takes his performance to a higher level and raises the bar for world cinema actors in the climax. He is extremely likable and excellent. Ma Dong-seok is brave, lively and energetic too. Jung Yu-mi impresses big time with her beautiful & emotionally active character. Kim Su-an is cute & impresses with her strong act in sequences which one can't expect from a child artist of her age. Other actors too deliver performances great enough to make you care for them. The film's scale is big, and the visual effects are amazing. Cinematography is excellent and captures the locales & thrilling action sequences with plenty of intrigue, while also succeeding in sending chills down your spine through the emotional sequences. Thankfully, it's not an Indian film, otherwise filmmakers won't have rested without adding songs & unnecessary romance. Whatever you see in the film, looks very, very realistic. The tension is very well built and neither do you deviate from enjoying the film, nor does the film deviate from storytelling. The story and screenplay are both excellent, and the editing is excellent. The only thing that disappointed me was the A certificate given to it by the Indian Censor Board called CBFC. Why? No nation of the world gave this film an 18+ rating except India & Malaysia. Leave Malaysian Certification system because they follow equal rules for all films Irrespective of the target audience. But in India, films with dozens of gory violence & bucket loads of vulgarity get a UA (PG) certificate. TRAIN TO BUSAN is a clean family entertainer despite the A certificate it has been subjected to. But it's not a mistake of the makers, so there was no flaw I found in the film.Overall, TRAIN TO BUSAN is a must watch film for any movie enthusiast. Irrespective of language and nation barriers, the film deserves to be watched by one and all. And yes, I forgot to tell. This film was the first one that actually made me cry. No film before had compelled me to shed tears, but this film did. Even the emotionless will emote. Such strong is this film. Go, watch it with your family and enjoy it fully, along with respecting the safe life we have from zombies in reality.",Train to Busan
80,miguelneto-74936,More than any zombie movie,9,18 April 2017,"Train to Busan is undoubtedly one of the best film of the genre, manages to mix Zombie with Drama very well with a little action, and it is the biggest proof that the Asian cinema is in its best phase, the plot obviously is nothing original, Always the thing about a virus, plus the idea of making a zombie movie where most of it goes on the Train is original and works great, and the characters are well built, the '' protagonist '' is a dumb face but His daughter changes him in the running of the movie, we have interesting characters, I like the character of Ma Donk-Seok too much, he is very funny, he has great dialogues, the makeup is well done, the rhythm is good, and the ending is a lot Well, I found it touching, I went to watch Train to Busan hoping for just one more generic movie, but I was very surprised.

81,Stephen_A_Abell,A Ferocious Bite Of Living Dead Excellency,10,21 September 2018,"I had this movie sitting on my ""YouView"" box for quite a few months, even though I had been originally excited that Film4 had decided to air this ""little"" Korean gem of a horror movie. There had been rave reviews and more than a slight ""buzz"" about the picture. The trouble with me is that I've been let down by hyped movies before - The Blair Witch Project, a major case by example. Another trouble is my own little foibles. I don't want to be reading subtitles when I'm tired (and I do so love to watch horror flicks after the sun has set with the lights low... or off!) and I cannot stand dubbed films (too many Jackie Chan movies in my youth...). So one night, not so very long ago I was feeling awake enough to read a movie so I hit play on ""Train To Busan""...By the time the end credits rolled I was amped up and wide awake. This is one hell of a rollercoaster ride of a movie and one hell of a tangle of modern-day lives story. This is not your basic Zombie flick.You start out really slowly and pretty sedated. A farmer is on his way to the market when his van is stopped by men in hazmat suits. These tell him that there's nothing to worry about. There has been a slight leak at a chemical plant. After quickly decontaminating his vehicle they send him on his way... unluckily for the dear he runs down and kills. More angry at damaging his van than killing a dear he drives away leaving the carcass in the road... yeah... you know what's going to happen. Sure enough, the dead animal thrashes about and shakily gets to its feet... with a dead look in its eyes...Even though this section only takes a few minutes it's one of the most superbly shot sequences I've seen in a movie. The director Yeon Sang Ho manipulates each set perfectly give the audience a creepily eerie atmosphere, which did start the shivers running up and down my spine. For that I thank them... it's been a long time since that's happened. There's nice steady sweeping camera pans. Effortlessly worked lighting. Superb control of sound... or lack of it. Even better is that all of this artwork and skill doesn't stop here it runs throughout the whole movie. It screams skill and class.Then the writers, Park Joo Suk and Yeon Sang Ho, get to work weaving together tales of modern-day living. The main characters are Seok-Woo (Gong Yoo) and his daughter Soo-Ann (Kim Su An). He is a busy, work-comes-first-to-support-family guy who was already lost his wife to divorce and is now bringing up Soo-Ann, with the help of his mother. Soo-Ann is a young child who doesn't understand or appreciate her father's outlook on life. All she knows is that she doesn't see either him or her mother as much as she wants or should. She wants more time with both of her parents. So, on her birthday, after her dad buys her a repeat present (who doesn't need two Nintendo Wii's(?)) she gets him to promise to take her to see her mum for her real present. As is the usual case it's Su-An Kim's performance that steals the show - and this is as it should be.This then brings them into contact with Sang-Hwa (Ma Dong Seok) and his very expectant wife Seong-Kyeong (Jung Yu Mi). Sang-Hwa and Seok-Woo do not get on at all and it's this juxtaposition in ideals and prerogatives that add more depth to the story; especially when they have to work together to survive the train ride. It's Seong-Kyeong that provides the glue to their relationship.Add to this a mysterious homeless man (Choi Gwi Hwa), a couple of romantic teens getting to grips with their feelings towards each other - Yong-Guk (Choi Woo Sic) and Jin-Hee (Sohee), and officious self-centred train manager Yon-Suk (Kim Eui Sung), you have a set of characters which can create some volatile or sentimental storylines... and this is before we get to the best Zombies... EVER!One of my favourite zombie flicks is Return Of The Living Dead. Two of the reasons were the zombies - they were dead and very icky (most were skinless)... and they were fast. The brain-eating buggers didn't shamble after you. And you have the same here. Though these dead aren't so skinless they are damned fast and furious.This adds to some pretty spectacular action scenes in the movie which Yuen Sang Ho directs magnificently. But, whereas, most directors would opt for action over horror and story Yuen is proficient in all styles. The scenes where the dead reanimate are both startling, invigorating, eerie, and full of style and strength.This is a tour-de-force of filmmaking, let alone horror filmmaking. Everything in this movie is excellent, from the story to the acting to the directing.",Train to Busan

84,tenshi_ippikiookami,Lots of fun,8,10 September 2016,"""Train to Busan"" is an amazingly entertaining movie, with a few missteps that stop it from being truly great.The story is pretty simple. Yoo Gong's Seok Woo is a man that only cares about his job. His wife has left him and lives in Busan, while his relationship with his daughter is becoming more and more strangled. The daughter (a quite amazing Soo-an Kim) wants to visit her mother for her birthday, and Seok Woo ends accepting. They decide to take the train from Seoul to Busan.At the same time a zombie-outbreak happens in South Korea.Cue lots of violence, running, blood and surprising moments, with a huge dose of feelings (but without falling into the cheesy).The movie keeps things simple: train, zombies, stations, and a bunch of people that will try to survive (some of them will do anything to do so). In that respect it is not especially original. The plot is thin as it comes, but the direction keeps things fast and breezy, and plot developments keep happening non-stop. The direction is a little bit video-game style, but fits the movie. The originality in the fights between the zombies and the survivors is one of the strong points of the movie, with some surprising moments. On the other hand, it can't help but fall into the ""I-don't-want-to-live-without-you"" moments, or some extra saccharine situations. Also, some of the characters' decision-making is just silly, and even if a couple of moments are clearly comedy, the line between comedy and action-horror is not clearly drawn, and some laughs are more on the ""wrong-time"" side. Actually, the movie is not very scary, but it is quite the ride.The acting is quite good, and some, as charisma-oozing Dong-seok Ma, or selfish-as-hell Eui-sung Kim, do a great job. And the music, scenery, and effects keep a good level thorough the film.There is also a quite obvious social commentary, but it does it in a way that it hits target more than misses, and brings its ideas clearly across the screen. This commentary elevates the movie in its lowest moments.""Train to Busan"" may not arrive on time, but you won't care.",Train to Busan
85,carbuff,"As far as Zombie movies go, it's got high production values, but low oringinality",6,12 September 2020,"I'm tempted to give ""Train to Busan"" only 5 stars, but I'm upping it to 6 due to it's extremely high production values. The best thing I can really say is that it's probably got more than enough blood and gore to keep zombie lovers happy. After reading so many really positive reviews, as soon as I noticed it was coming off Netflix, I rushed to watch it immediately. I really wish I hadn't bothered. ""Train to Busan"" is no more than a rehash of countless past films--everything from the ""modern"" zombies to the old-fashioned moral lessons. There's nothing original or thought-proving at all. It's basically a Hollywood popcorn feature emphasizing a tighter social and ethical code (like, say, how we idealize our own society of some decades ago). ""Train to Busan"" isn't bad, it just wasn't the phenomenal viewing experience I was expecting given the reviews or the shockingly strong films that sometimes come out of Korea. Frankly, I don't know what so many other people are thinking. For my tastes, although very slick, ""The Train to Busan"" was simply too long and too ordinary and too blatantly emotionally manipulative to be worthwhile or memorable.",Train to Busan
86,gregsrants,Great Thrill Ride,8,16 October 2016,"No genre has suffered from volume overload as the zombie genre. Zombie television shows, zombie movies both theatrical and straight to video, city zombie walks.zombies are everywhere. Because of the glut of flesh eating walking dead, no genre has suffered so much with overkill. Zombies themselves are not particularly interesting beasts. They don't have any character. They just run (or slow walk) bite and run (or slow walk) again. You won't find many reviews on the thousands of zombie films that will go into detail about the complex layers of the zombie's inner mind.With what seems like an endless parade of zombie films each week being offered across various platforms it's a nice surprise when a film such as Train to Busan offers what feels like a fresh take on an exhausted premise.Train to Busan is a South Korean zombie film brought to us from writer/director Sang-ho Yeon. The idea is commonplace – a zombie apocalypse is underway – but the setting adds to the drama. The movie takes place almost exclusively on a train where the passengers are stuck in in a speeding bullet. And when an infected individual boards the train, the group's only safety will be in the various train cars free of the blood hungry hordes.The group of characters that face life and death to zombie situations are an eclectic band of heroes and villains including a father and daughter team, a pregnant woman and her husband, a young teenage baseball team and various train attendants. Their survival is hanging on the notion that if the train full of zombies can reach the Busan station where the military is lying in wait.Although there are plenty of been there/seen that moments in Train to Busan, the film still offers a fresh feel largely due to the claustrophobic setting. There are some fresh ideas – such as what happens to the zombies when the train enters into a tunnel – and these ideas coupled with zombies that run like Olympic qualifiers and above average special effects lead to a heart pounding rollicking good time.One could not fully review Train to Busan without discussing the ending. Starting with an unexpected train crash the final few reels are filled with one surprise after another. And the ending is almost heart-wrenching in its execution.Train to Busan is a thrill ride. A thrill ride that was a rousing crowd pleaser when it screened at the Toronto After Dark Film Festival. But it is more than just a genre festival favorite. It is one of best zombie films every produced and might just be one of the best movies of any genre in 2016.",Train to Busan
87,spookyrat1,First Class Ride on the Zombie Express!,9,1 April 2020,"Not since George A Romero's ground-breaking Night of the Living Dead have I been quite so excited by a zombie film, as I have by Korean director Yeon Sang-ho's outstanding Train to Busan written by Park Joo-suk. Just as Romero's iconic black and white feature almost single-handedly dragged horror stories away from the antiquated gothic conventions of yesteryear, Train to Busan is most definitely a zombie film for a 21st century global world, familiar with the challenges associated with all manner of international travails.The film mostly takes place on a bullet train travelling from Seoul to Busan as a zombie apocalypse suddenly breaks out in the country and threatens the safety of all the confined passengers. These include Seok-woo a cynical workaholic fund manager and divorced father of his daughter Su-an, who wants to spend her birthday with her mother in Busan. Other passengers include Sang-hwa and his pregnant wife Seong-kyeong, Yon-suk a calculating, manipulative chief executive, a high school baseball team including Yong-guk and his cheerleader girlfriend Jin-hee, elderly sisters In-gil and Jong-gil, and a traumatized homeless stowaway hiding in the bathroom. As the train departs, an ill young woman runs onto the train unnoticed. She turns into a zombie and attacks a train attendant, who also turns. The infection spreads rapidly throughout the confined spaces of the train.The beauty of this film is that it doesn't just concentrate on the provision of standard visceral generic thrills. It serves as a vehicle to highlight civil unrest resulting in mass hysteria and general panic and indecisiveness; the root of confusing mixed messaging and communications from governing authorities. It can also be seen as a scrutinising microscope, forensically examining the breakdown of nuclear families, socio-economic class distinctions and seeking answers to ethical and moral questions such as which is of greater importance, survival of the individual or the collective?Fine performances abound from the large cast with particular attention being directed towards Ma Dong-seok as Sang-hwa, a tough, working-class man, who is first to demonstrate to other passengers that it is possible to fight back against insurmountable odds, whilst showing care towards other individuals. Ostensible lead actor Gong Yoo is also very convincing as a self-centred work obsessive, who slowly realises his personal responsibilities to others, as well as his own latent skills and talents that may help him and others survive the onslaughts they must face.The film created on a budget of just US$8.5 million is a technical marvel, filled with a number of amazing shots, which I for one couldn't help wondering how they had actually been staged and to what extent, if any, was CGI involved. The suspense and thrill factor is only enhanced by a number of twists and turns and breath-taking set pieces which never appear contrived or staged, rather logical outcomes from previous actions.I can only encourage you to grab a ticket and climb aboard the Train to Busan; not just a clever, fresh take on the zombie genre, but also an extremely well-made film with fully realised characters and plenty of social commentary to underscore the bursts of skilfully staged action.",Train to Busan
88,Falconeer,"Forgettable, Generic Horror",5,19 October 2019,"If you want to understand how far the quality of horror movies, and cinema in general, have disintegrated over the years, just watch one of these new-age, current movies, back to back with something like ""Return of the Living Dead,"" (1985.) or ""The Beyond"" (1981). The decline in quality of our entertainment is sad and astonishing. ""Road To Busang"" is another modern zombie movie, utterly indiscernible from all the other current horror crap, with it's flat, cheap cinematography, fake looking CGI, and this desperate need these current zombie films seem to all have, in bringing emotional drama into a genre where it is laughably out of place and just ludicrous. Some exciting zombie chase scenes are present and the large cast is impressive, but we have seen it before, in movies like ""28 Days Later."" Honestly, there is nothing new here, and the only outstanding quality is that little girl, who gives quite an impressive performance in this. On a side note, all the raves and compliments showered upon a cast member who played a cheerleader, made me curious to see what all the fuss was about. Imagine how shocked I was to see the ""Goddess"" is actually some little girl with thin, stringy black hair that looks like a cheap wig for a witch costume, legs like toothpicks and the facial features of a down syndrome victim. Is this the current idea of beauty? Did anyone else wonder where her chin went? Maybe it got eaten by zombies. It seems like the beauty standards have gone down the sewer, along with popular taste in film and music. I find this a bit sad. ""Train To Busan"" is one of those popcorn flicks that you watch once while texting on your phone...something that you forget 5 minutes after you see it. I refer to the majority of current films and music as ""throwaway entertainment."" Nobody is going to be talking about this movie 2 years from now...nobody will even remember it.

89,joebloggscity,Next Stop: Korean Zombies - Worth getting on for,8,21 October 2018,"I've had a big thing for Korean horror films from the 2000s in particular, but of late have lost touch. I was recommended this movie to sit down and watch, and what a pleasant surprise it turned out to be.Zombie films have been done to the death (no pun intended) over the past decade or two, and there have been some very interesting and enjoyable movies over a number of genres. However, this one sidesteps the problems some others have by having a good director, budget and good cast of actors with a fine script. Avoiding the slapstick, comedy or torture porn route, this is a story about redemption for a father out to protect his daughter and discover the human within. Okay, that's not exactly wholly original (e.g. War of the Worlds etc) but it does have heart and keeps you engrossed.As per the name of the film, the travellers are stuck on a train to Busan from Seoul along with the zombies, and we have action without too much gore/violence, but really tension and emotion as we watch our protagonists try to survive this catastrophe. There are some cliched characters, for example the older selfish rich businessman and the old couple etc, but really you can't change everything. It still works.Granted this doesn't have any social commentary like some that made the zombie genre famous, e.g. the Night of the Living Dead, but in its own way it is a refreshing change on the low budget or comedy-centric comedies that have abounded of late in the field. I really enjoyed it. Bit concerned if they make a sequel, but that will be inevitable. Worth a try.",Train to Busan

Years later I got a chance to see Train To Busan. The quality of the film matches World War Z in every respect. Train To Busan has a different setting to World War Z.The film is shot at a train station. Therefore all the action scenes are set inside and around trains. If you like films that are set on trains then you'll like this film. Examples are Murder on the Orient Express(1974), Narrow Margin(1990), Under Siege 2: Dark Territory(1995), Unstoppable(2010).The supporting cast is superb. Gong Yoo plays the central character of the film alongside a host of gifted actors. Ma Dong-seok is another talented actor. Kim Su-an does a wonderful performance as a child-actress.Note that this is a graphic horror film with intense scenes of gore. People who are new to this genre should perhaps see the trailer to the film before watching this one.There is a companion animated feature film to Train To Busan: Seoul Station, also directed by Sang-ho, was released less than a month later after the main film.Want to see more Zombie films?

92,Rob-O-Cop,"Good zombie movie, Bad soap opera",6,13 September 2016,"The zombie bits were good but unfortunately the bits in between and at the start were some pretty average family drama cliché. Daddy works too hard and the daughter resents it, school performance he didn't make it to, the Korean relationship dynamic cliché (I really hope this isn't normal in real life Korea but it appears in every relationship in their movies), nagging wife, dumb (huh?) beaten down husband. The self centered baddie is a pretty easy to loath character, so well done on that, the effects were nice, the zombies looked great, sound was great, cinematography was a bit 'digital camera', but passable. They laid the syrup sentimentality on with a shovel and it really drags the movie down, making a 6 instead of an 8.",Train to Busan

Boy, these zombies could movie.What sunk the film was the studio's (or director's) incessant interesting in wringing out as many melodramatic tears from their audience as they possibly could. In the end, it seems like the film was geared towards a specific audience - grandmothers who'd never seen a horror film, or any film, in their lives.After the end of this flick, if you're a casual moviegoer, you feel robbed, kinda like sitting through a movie you didn't know what just a commercial for Christianity or Scientology or whatever in the end.

95,silvermistvio,Great zombie film even though it's Korea's the first zombie film ever.,10,18 May 2019,"Train to Busan is Korea's the first zombie film and also one of the best zombie films of all time. I rarely watch Korean films, but when I saw this film, I was totally surprised because it's the first.As the film name, Train to Busan, the whole thing happened on the train. So, the filming location scope is small but it turned out great. What I like of this film is it shows if you don't want to die, you'll die quicker than usual. So, we don't need to afraid of dying. We all have to die one day anyway. No one can avoid it.I really hate that CEO guy. The way he try to survive by pushing all people around him to die is something I hate most. And also I hate Koreans always love to kill off the main character(s), making the film unhappy ending. If they make the film end with some kind of happy ending, it'd be better than this.The makeup skills, special effects used in this film and performances of actors and actresses are good, so that the film becomes better and better. Even though this film is the first zombie film that Koreans ever made, it's like they had a lot of experiences with zombie films. They could make a great one on the first go.Although there are some things that I don't like in this film, it still makes one of the best zombie films I've ever watched. It's enjoyable, so, I recommend you all to watch it.",Train to Busan
96,witster18,Without Question Belongs With the Best the Genre Has to Offer - mild spoiler,8,14 December 2016,"It isn't perfect. Some of the CGI could be tightened-up just a bit. THere.That is the only criticism I can think of.""Train to Busan"" is a superlative zombie film. Most films in this genre suffer from unrealistic and inconsistent moments. Well, it's a zombie movie so I guess calling it unrealistic is a bit moronic, but you know what I mean. The zombies acting inconsistently, or other stuff that just doesn't make sense. No character arcs, or many unfinished subplots and forgotten references also seem to be common weaknesses with these types of films. NOT HERE.This film does nearly everything flawlessly. It does follow a cookie-cutter template, but the Koreans follow that template and create a near perfect zombie film.The pacing is fantastic. The set-up is slow and methodical but effective, the build-up accelerates like a ZR1, and the stretch run has you glued oooey-blueey to the flat-screen. The characters are perfect, blending seamlessly and falling perfectly into the storyline of the film. The main roles are acted to perfection but I keep going back to the consistencies of this film that make it so great. Every moment when I anticipated an inconsistent action or scene - it failed to come. Instead, it handles every transition, every character, and every zombie tradition with painstaking care. The actions of the zombies and characters, and the timelines, set-structure and locations are laid out perfectly.Now, I'm sure there are many great films to come on my 2016 watchlist. I have 47 of 89 films still to watch, and many of the higher anticipated films are sitting in the un-watched portion. But, for now, ""Train to Busan"" joins ""Hell or High Water"", ""Deadpool"", ROgue One"", and ""Zootopia"" as my favorite films of 2016 so far. It's right in the same class as ""28 Days Later"", ""Return of the Living Dead"", ""Shaun of the Dead"", and ""Pontypool"" for me. Truly. An instant rewatch. A next day Blu-ray purchase(if avail today - hmmm). The film, despite some small CGI shortcomings, is better than most in that respect, and the overall look is still great. The film doesn't tackle some of the normal eradication subplots, and I think the movie is better for it. While the template might be basic, the execution and flow is anything but.This is one of the best Zombie movies ever made. I wouldn't be surprised if this 7.6 current rating climbs a nitch and settles around 7.7-7.8. It's a solid 8/10 for me, and may honestly be the best zombie movie I've ever seen. It certainly gives ""Night of the Living Dead"", and a couple of others(ROTLD,SOTD, PONTY, 28, DOTD,RE-Anim) a run for their money.Flat-out AWESOME zombie-flick. If this is your bag - I would save the rental money and just buy it - you won't regret the decision or the savings.No need for a ""you'd like this if you liked"" list... 84/100It's not scary... it's just really, really entertaining.. and makes recent American Zombie flicks look pretty awful if you ask me.",Train to Busan

98,Darkside-Reviewer,This is how you make a Zombie movie,9,10 July 2019,An absolute blood fest zombie movie with zombies that make you feel genuine fear with there movement sounds and even dislocated body parts clicking and cracking against the bones as they move the tight spaces of the train gives a clostrophobic feeling especially when there's zombie in both directions and knowhere you can run too.The movie follows a father and daughter who take a train journey to Busan for the daughters birthday but the same day a zombie outbreak occurs and as the train leaves the station a frantic woman boards the train who brings the infection with her and from one bite to the next the train quickly becomes overrun with zombies the passengers in a panic make it to the far end of the train and bar the door while hearing those behind them scream in terror but that was only beginning of this night now the survivors on the train must survive until they reach the end of the line if there is one anymore.The movie is in Korean with English subtitles and I have to say the acting is very good from everyone involved the directing is marvelous the make up and effects look amazing the zombies look better than big budget Hollywood movies with lots of blood injury detail and the way the zombies body's move and contract is something I've never seen before it had me in Awww of just how amazing it looks.I recommend this movie to any Horror movie and zombie fan it's worth your time 100% it's a zombie movie done right and with all the let down zombie movies of the modern day this movie shows Hollywood up and says this is how it's done.,Train to Busan
99,msbreviews,Train to Busan is arguably the best zombie apocalypse film of all-time!,10,27 October 2020,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)Zombie apocalypse is far from being a groundbreaking subgenre. The Walking Dead franchise is arguably the most popular show on Earth when it comes to portraying this supernatural future. World War Z and the Zombieland duology play that role in the movies' realm. However, all of these works fail to reach the always high expectations that come with a story set in a time like this. When people ask, ""what's the best zombie apocalypse film ever?"", one doesn't have a clear answer simply because there isn't an outstanding, mind-blowing, near-perfect flick. Well, at least not until 2016, the year of release of the best movie in the genre, Train to Busan.I genuinely feel sorry for everyone who refuses to watch foreign films for whatever reason. A different language and/or the display of subtitles shouldn't be enough to convince viewers to ignore so many unique works from all around the world. If someone dares to call themselves a ""zombies fan"" and has not watched Train to Busan yet, then ""fan"" is far from being the right description. This is South Korean cinema at its best. Everyone is 200% committed to their role, whether that is a stunt man or one of the protagonists. Yeon Sang-ho delivers a powerfully suspenseful, intense, epic, and most of all, heartbreaking story with the help of a phenomenal screenplay written by Park Joo-suk.When the only ""negative"" aspect that I can find is related to ""maybe not-that-logical"" specific actions performed by some characters, I know that I'm nitpicking a near-perfect movie. I struggle to find a single real issue with the entire film. In my opinion, the reason why the latter works so well is largely due to Park Joo-suk's script. Usually, people always think about the zombies first: how do they look? How do they act? Do they run wildly or stroll? Which new attributes or skills do these zombies have different from what we've seen until now? How did it all begin? Is there a cure? Granted, the zombies look cool, and Yeon Sang-ho is able to create impressive action sequences filled with maximum intensity and extreme tension. Entertainment-wise: top-notch.However, the action only works as well as it does due to the emotional bond that the viewer shares with the (non-infected) human characters. These are beautifully treated and developed in such a remarkable manner. There are easily five to six characters that the viewer ends up caring deeply about. Typically, at least half of this group is expendable in this type of film because some characters show no signs of intelligence or are just douchebags. In Train to Busan, every single character possesses likable traits, besides being directly connected to each other (father-daughter, young couple pregnant). The action scenes are filmed in incredible fashion, but it's the encompassing emotional aura that ultimately elevates them.It's really an emotionally devastating story. The viewer is placed in dozens of situations that require the hardest of choices from the main characters. The generic dilemma ""do I save the person I care about or everyone else?"" is taken to a whole other level with exceptional dialogues, filled with an excruciating amount of suspense, leaving me about to tear up on more than just a couple of times. Every character has a terrific, compelling arc. The main protagonist, Seok-woo (Gong Yoo), goes from being a despicable character, one that I wouldn't mind seeing killed in the first fifteen to twenty minutes, to a lovable father that only wants what's best for her daughter, protecting her at all costs during the apocalypse.This movie is packed with clever social commentary, relatable to this day (and even more during the current global pandemic). Yon-suk (Kim Eui-sung) represents everything that's wrong with our society. A selfish man who thinks he's more important than everyone else due to his class and whose job is more significant than his own family or friends, let alone strangers on a train. He also works as a ""wake-up call"" to our protagonist, as a ""what if"" version of Seok-woo's future if he continues to only focus on his job. Another character of great relevance is Sang-hwa (Ma Dong-seok), a father-to-be who ends up protecting Seok-woo's daughter when her father can't. His bravery and selflessness make him an instant audience favorite.Technically, it's genuinely a flawless film. From the outstanding zombie makeup to the mind-blowing stunt work, everything action-related serves as evidence to prove that South Korean cinema does action a thousand times better than conventional Hollywood. The level of intensity is ridiculous. Lee Hyung-deok's camera work is absolutely brilliant, moving through the train seamlessly, letting the viewer see and understand everything. Aided by excellent editing (Yang Jin-mo) and a phenomenal score (Jang Young-gyu), Yeon Sang-ho generates tension and suspense in a way that makes every single action sequence feel overwhelming, powerful, and even epic.A runtime close to the two-hour mark that flies by. The first act perfectly sets up the apocalypse to come with a surprisingly subtle build-up of the exponentially growing chaos. Then, the outbreak in the train which occupies most of the movie's duration. During this period, everything happens. From the nail-biting action sequences to the emotionally powerful moments of character decisions that make this film so shocking. Finally, a third act that left me floored, completely drained of emotions, not knowing exactly how to feel after it all ended. Despite a couple of sequences that I believe were exclusively executed in the way they were to offer an emotionally climactic moment, everything else feels impressively realistic.All in all, Train to Busan is arguably the best zombie apocalypse movie of all-time, at least, until the date of this review. The subgenre finds in Yeon Sang-ho's mind-blowing flick the masterpiece it deserves. From the exceptionally subtle build-up to the emotionally devastating final act, passing through the most vivid, suspenseful, tense depiction of a zombie outbreak ever put to screen, Park Joo-suk's screenplay is the reason why this film succeeds so well. A heartbreaking story featuring astonishingly well-developed characters, surrounded by a powerfully resonant social commentary, even more in the current days. Action-wise, it's South Korean cinema at its best: maximum intensity, phenomenal camera work, seamless editing, chill-inducing score, outstanding commitment from everyone involved, and a fantastic stunt team. Hollywood should learn from movies like this. I can't find a single flaw. It left me emotionally drained. If you're a fan of cinema, no matter the genre, this *must* be on your watchlist!Rating: A+",Train to Busan

101,SoumikBanerjee25,South Korean Film Industry is the Next Big Thing!,7,25 September 2020,"What differentiates ""Train To Busan"" from the rest is its immaculate character expansion & a profound piece of social commentary!
It may insinuate as another generic Zombie feature but trust me when I insist it's more than that.'Zombies' when you hear the word, you may be prodded by the never ending Resident Evil Franchise or some individual ventures by Hollywood studios! No matter how you got your firsthand experience with this type of Horror but I'm certain; you either have lots of fondness or a box full of disgust for these.
Zombie Movies have always gained traction from audiences'. Especially for its exaggerated Tonality. Albeit a tried & tested formula for box office success.
Yet most of the times makers get it totally wrong. They fixate so much on its extravaganza that they kinda forget about fundamental nuances.'Train To Busan' is evidently diverse in that case. Crafted by utmost maturity, this not only showcases usual tropes of the Sub Genre but also provides an underlying Socio Political attire which considerably indicates our Class partite society.
All of the characters in here, portrays distinctive thoughts and ideologies! They all come from different backgrounds resulting a versatile input into characterization aspect!
Their convincing acts had helped in that regard as well.
The storyline showed its efficacy in emotions! Teared me up good, not gonna lie.
Cinematography is great, for a South Korean production they undoubtedly nailed on the technical front.Except the Soundscore!I might be in the minority here, but the soundtrack didn't seem impressive to me at all! It felt highly incapable of generating fitting emotions in certain sequences!
I'm not saying it's trash; could have been miles better though!
Another negative would be its marginally stretched screenplay which caused its necessary momentum to break oftentimes.
It also had inconsistencies throughout the plot in terms of writing & detailing.
Bearing in mind possible spoilers, I'm staying away from any sort of explanation but you will understand.Still I can comprehend all of your affection for it! This is more than a mindless Zombie execution which had strong sentiments underneath unlike any iterations we might have watched previously.",Train to Busan
102,Imdbidia,Utterly entertaining,7,12 March 2017,"Train to Busan is an uber-entertaining action-packed, not-a-minute-of-rest Zombie Korean movie. No time to get bored, the zombies are like rats coming out of nowhere, with a healthy appetite for human flesh, and our heroes are bunch of normal good people stuck on the carriages of a train heading to the city of Busan.I thoroughly enjoyed this film, which has nothing to envy to any of Hollywood zombie movies. The film might pass as an American film except for the message, because the message is definitely not Anglo-Saxon culture is Asian culture - individualism sucks, you care and you take care of your people, your don't just look after yourself, that is egotistical and inhumane. You are an hero for the love of your people not a hero per se. On the other hand, as always happens on this sort of movies, one questions who is more savage, the zombies, who became so against their will, or the humans not infected treating other human beings inhumanly out of suspicion.The actors are good in their roles but the beautiful girl Soo-An Kim is really the best of the lot. Her face is uber-beautiful, but without her mix of innocence and her dramatic qualities as an actress the film would have not worked or been so impacting. One really believes that what is happening to her is real. I also loved Yumi-Jung as the pregnant fragile Seong-kyeong, and Eui-sung Kim is excellent as the quintessential baddie Yon-suk.The main downside of the film is not what is in the film, but what is not in it. What was the origin of this zombie outbreak and how was controlled? That is never properly explored or explained. I could forgive the first question, but the second I thought it was unavoidable. Original? No. Good, Yes. Entertaining? Very. Satisfying, just partially.",Train to Busan

104,meydiana-65242,Rate 10/10,10,24 November 2020,"An overall excellent movie
A friend of mine recommended this movie. In his words, it would be ""a kickass Korean zombie flick"", so naturally i went into this movie expecting another generic, dumb, goofy zombie splatter film. Boy, was I in for a surprise!First of all, the acting is spot on. All the actors are doing a tremendously great job, but for me, little Soo-an Kim totally nails it in one of the best child actor performances I have ever seen. The zombie actors are also truly exceptional and they manage to spook you, without having to rely on heavy prosthetics and rotting flesh.Secondly, the cinematography is amazing. Although the whole story is taking place during daytime, the film manages to make you feel claustrophobic and constantly nervous without having to rely on cheap tricks such as jump scares or low lighting conditions. The cuts are seamless, the colours great and, though different from Hollywood standards, it is a generally really good looking movie.What really captured me though in this film was the drama. In this genre the characters are usually very generic and one dimensional. Though this flick is, at first, not so different in this aspect, as the story carries on we witness the shifting between the dynamics of the characters, we see their personalities evolve and change, we find out about their motives, their relationships and the depths they would go for their loved ones. I personally found myself very emotionally invested to the characters (which might be due to the great acting performances),I was actively routing for them and was really moved by the movie's finale.Don't get me wrong though. This is not some melodramatic drama flick. It is still an awesome zombie apocalypse movie. It is fast paced, it is action-packed, it is gory, it is tense and terrifying and it will keep you at the edge of your seat. It is also original, it doesn't play around and will surely satisfy even the hardcore fans of the genre. However, it is also a film you will remember for its awesome story and characters and for being an overall great movie. 10/10.",Train to Busan
105,asda-man,Zombies on a train,9,21 September 2016,"Zombie films have been hitting our screens since the dawn of time. Well, it certainly feels like they have anyway. Popularised by George A Romero's terrific Dead trilogy, zombie films have since been rearing their heads like hordes of the undead themselves. Whilst they can be a lot of fun, more often than not, they can also be cliché ridden and trashy. We have had some quite enjoyable zombie films recently such as, Cockneys Vs Zombies and The Horde but we haven't really had a properly great zombie movie since 2004's Shaun of the Dead. Train to Busan changes that.I saw Train to Busan on a whim. I'm travelling in Singapore and had a few free days so I thought that I'd check what's on the cinemas here. Train to Busan caught my eye but I had never heard of it, however I saw that it was Korean and that it had zombies in it, so I was sold! To my surprise, I came out of the cinema having just viewed easily the best zombie film in a decade. Korean films have hardly ever let me down and Busan is no exception.As there's very little coverage of this film on the Internet, I'd better give a rough plot outline. It basically follows a selfish father who is cold and neglectful towards his cute young daughter. For her birthday, she wants to travel to Busan to see her mother so he reluctantly takes her on the train to Busan (creative title) however, a rather inconvenient zombie outbreak occurs as they board the train. The rest of the film is a claustrophobic and thrilling fight for survival as the survivors desperately try everything in their measure to get to Busan on a undead-infested train.What makes this film so great is the characters. Most horror films (particularly ones with zombies in) sprinkle a load of disposable characters in who all die in a predictable order. We don't often particularly care when they die, in fact we're more likely to relish the gory death shown in all its bloody gory. In contrast, Train to Busan focuses in on a line of memorable characters who we actually care about and want to see survive. They're developed in such a way that when someone cruelly perishes, we feel a great sense of loss and emotion. This is where the film's strength lies. What's also interesting is that they're not all stereotypes either. The protagonist isn't your typical hero, he's a character who is grossly selfish and unlikable at the start, but he subtlety develops into someone you begin to care about and admire.The film starts off as a good little zombie thriller. There's a sense of realism to the whole situation as we're made to watch the panic unfold on the train in an effective way. There's also a nice comic touch to the whole thing with some witty dialogue so it never takes itself too seriously. It also somehow never gets boring even though the film is essentially two hours set on a train, which is no easy task. There's always tension and a sense of peril. You get the feeling that anything could happen to these characters at any given moment. Once the film reaches the mid-way point though it stops being good and starts becoming great.Things get going fairly quickly so the characters develop through the action, making the film all the more gripping as it goes on. It's an unpredictable ride with lots of thrilling set- pieces to keep you on edge. The final half hour is essentially non-stop action and it becomes exhausting to watch without ever feeling too ridiculous. What really impressed me though was the emotional charge in the second half. There are a few scenes which had me welling up with tears, which I wasn't expecting. I just got so absorbed in the characters and their intense situation. The use of music and editing is also hugely effective in pulling at your heartstrings.There's really very little which Train to Busan does wrong. If I were to nitpick, I'd say that I would've liked more gore. Zombie films always give a good excuse to give us an array of fun, gory effects but this film is surprisingly restrained. There's a lot of hand-to-hand combat and nothing else creative. However, this does sort of add to the realism of the situation as you're not going to find many axes or chainsaws on a train. It's still not as bloodless as World War Z.I can't urge you enough to watch Train to Busan, especially if you're a fan of Korean cinema. It doesn't just offer plenty of nail-biting thrills and impressive special effects, It offers emotion and splendid characters whom you can properly invest in. It's a powerful film which wears its heart on its sleeve and contains more character development in two hours than The Walking Dead has in six seasons. Once the film was over I became overcome with emotion. I felt like I could just break down and cry at what I had just watched. This is so much more than a zombie flick, at its heart it's a devastating drama about family and the importance of human kindness. I loved it.",Train to Busan
106,DogePelis2015,ZOMBIES AND DESTRUCTION,10,19 April 2021,Korean movies are pretty good and this one is no exception; the plot is very suspenseful and very entertaining from beginning to end. TOTALLY RECOMMENDED!,Train to Busan
107,garethcrook,Zombies on a train.,7,14 May 2020,"Zombie film. Surely there's too many of these. This one though I've heard is rather good. Not snakes on a plane, but zombies on a train. Bear with me... We're in Seoul, Seok-woo and his young daughter Soo-an are heading to see his ex-wife, who lives in Busan. Even as we leave Seoul, something isn't right. A sky-rise on fire, partial reports of a leak at a plant. We know zombies are imminent having seen a deer reanimate in the opening scene... looks really cool actually. The train pulls away, but not before one of these now human zombies that we've half spotted in the periphery gets on board. Seok-woo isn't the most attentive father and falls asleep as their journey begins, leaving his inquisitive daughter to roam the train, just as things are getting weird. Now let's get to the point... are the zombies any good? Well yes, yes they are! They're quick, coming to life in bone cracking yoga poses, all snarly, rapidly covered in convincing looking blood and the camera cuts are choppy at breakneck speeds. Add lots of flesh ripping and screaming and we're on the right track, so to speak. It quickly becomes clear that life outside the train is a bit buggered. Zombies everywhere, standard apocalypse. Thanks to YouTube clips viewed on phones and a government news broadcast on the trains TV, urging people to stay home to remain safe (that sounds familiar), the passengers realise the scale of the situation and panic accordingly. So we've a microcosm of society on board, half the train infected, half okay. Separated by a barricade of luggage, a door and the zombie stupidity at not attacking because they can't see their prey. If that were it I'd say this film was in trouble, but an ill-advised stop does manage to rid the train of a few zombies, provide respite for the now few survivors and add some meat to the back story bone. It's here too that the film takes on a disaster movie tone. There's a plan now. Back on the train, there are people trapped in random cars and toilets, including Soo-an now separated from her frankly quite useless father. It gets a bit more inventive and this is accompanied by some of the characters stories getting fleshed out a little more... but only a little. It does look cool, there's some great sequences and the characters although a bit one dimensional are good enough to carry it. There are clear favourites you want to root for and those you can't wait to be zombie fodder. I think though that I was expecting more and expectations are always dangerous. If you like zombie films, you will love this, but if you're after something a bit meatier, this I think comes up short. Su-an Kim, as the young Soo-an really is the stand out. Some of the other performances are good, but she brings her A-game and really is the glue that holds it together. A good zombie film is always worth a watch and this is, but it's only that, a good zombie film, nothing more... and that zombie deer in the opening scene really does look cool.",Train to Busan

113,JakeBrinkman,My new favorite zombie movie,10,24 October 2019,"Train to Busan was a non-stop trip through a phenomenal zombie film. The zombies were truly frightening, and I felt they behaved very realistically in their mad dashes to their targets. It was reminiscent of World War Z, while also giving more consideration to the limits of the human body. This is the first time I've seen a movie where the dead eyes somewhat affected their vision, and I absolutely love that addition.The acting from even the child and the minor supporting roles was absolutely top notch. Even the smallest supporting roles were given so much depth that I was convinced the characters were real people. My only dislikes about the movie were how some characters behaved, but it's also very easy to see how some people really would behave that way in that situation, so I don't fault the movie for including them. It was very obvious the actors really connected with their characters' emotions, and it really paid off to create an epic film that was easy to connect to.Most zombie films show a world where no one has ever heard of a zombie, but Train to Busan was more realistic for the current world. It was fun to see a group that knew the basics of handling themselves, and I loved that, even with this knowledge, they still struggled thanks to some characters' dumb decisions and the total chaos that is expected in that situation. It was an all around fantastic movie that I highly recommend.",Train to Busan

The acting is decent, the special effects are meh. To be fair on that part, these were all newly infected people, so there was no decay to show.What I found interesting about this, as it comes from a culture where honor and class are so essential to the daily lives of the Koreans, that it lent another layer of story to the movie.

120,david-meldrum,"Hits All The Genre Tropes With Thrilling Aplomb, And Gives Food For Thought Also",8,17 June 2019,"(ONE SLIGHT SPOILER)Genre movies can get a rough critical ride - if a movie, film, book or whatever - hits all the expected beats and notes one might expect, it's easily dismissed. It's said to have done nothing meaningful, to be derivative. But as long as we've been telling stories, genres have been important - they provide comfort and a structure to tell a story that we feel safe with and understand.Additionally, to dismiss genre art misses something very significant; many of humanity's greatest artists have worked within the strictures of the genre. Shakespeare is an example par excellence of this - most of his plays fit an established contemporary genre. What is exceptional in them is how he develops character and themes within these genres, whilst still pleasing those who came along for the comfort of the predictable (as well as the sublime language, of course).South Korea action-horror movie Train To Busan is a genre movie with the highest of high concepts: zombies on a train. If that doesn't get a horror-action fan's juices flowing, then little will. It's stark and efficient; as characters board a train, a zombie outbreak (the word is only used once in the film) hits the world outside and inside the train. The action sequences are visceral and thrilling; making full use of the train's geography, and the rare sequences outside the train work equally effectively without disrupting the claustrophobic, trapped tone.For the genre fan looking further, there's more to see. An incisive, satirically edged, take on the walls, customs and strictures we put around each other and others to protect our standing in families and societies.(slight spoiler)The fatal flaw of this zombie outbreak is that the zombies can only hunt what they can see. This means a couple of things - it adds some great wrinkles to action sequences when the train unpredictably enters or emerges from a tunnel, for example. But this idea also plays up the themes of the film, especially in the well-timed lull in advance of the film's final act as these ideas are given more space to breathe than in other similar films.A key plot moment in the last twenty minutes tries to present some redemption and hope; I'm not convinced it works tonally or plot-wise; the ultimate conclusion a necessary upbeat that unsurprisingly allows a sequel should box office permit (it did - a sequel is in production).It's not a perfect film, but this first live-action movie from the director promises much to watch with interest in years to come.",Train to Busan
121,dcarsonhagy,A Zombie Film with Heart,7,27 December 2016,"""Train to Busan"" weaves a tale--and very good one--about how much life is worth living and how we ALL take it for granted. The story starts with a father and his daughter boarding a train in Seoul destined for Busan. Little do they know their innocent trip will eventually end in a fight for their lives and everyone around them.What I enjoyed most about ""Train"" was the characters were REAL. Each person played his/her part with panache; therefore, it was easy to feel for each of them. From the homeless man who boards the train with a foreshadowing message to the self-centered father, every part is just as critical as the others. To me, it would be hell on earth if this kind of outbreak happened: nowhere to run; nowhere to hide.""Train"" is rated ""R"" for violence, language, and disturbing images.

I'd give it a 9 out of 10.It's maybe a little campier than I expected, with some over-the-top zombies that feel more reminiscent of the ""Evil Dead"" films than George A. Romero's movies or Robert Kirkman's work. It's also a bit long at nearly two hours — if I were editing it, I would have swapped out some of the time devoted to car-to-car melees with additional scenes showing what's transpired beyond the train. Imagine how a skilled screenwriter could further expand on the (really cool) train station plot points we already see  what if the train was forced to stop at every station? What if it couldn't stop? What if its passengers were turned away at safe areas? What if desperate stragglers tried to board the train?This was a good one, people. Check it out.",Train to Busan

THey see you In light. Clear as day! In The walking dead they still haven't set the rules down after 7 seasons! and I still wonder what makes the zombies tick. Everything seems to apply there, They come towards you if they spot flames? if they here sound, their blood doesn't affect you if you get it in the eyes etc. THey smell you? It's different tricks I get that, but TWD clearly doesn't know themselves. As many others I've seen countless of zombie films, better for worse. All these parodies that sucked so bad,Not fun at all. THe old occult 70s zombie flicks I love! but they are more summoned by ancient powers and a bit tame in the practical effect department. but it ain't what I've been craving for. evil dead and re animator, planet terror are more demonic etc etc, Train to busan gets it right In seconds. Its a joyride finish to end. ALl the actors play their part perfectly for what the script gave them. It may be a little lighthearted and not gory at all. But that wasn't the intention here i believe. It's a zombie film to just sit back, drink a cup of coffee and enjoy. and for what it does. It's excellent. The only little thing I can complain about is the world war z cgi piles. Even if many other zombie films does something better here and there. many of them have great set design or really badass zombies but they falter big time through the rest with some silly side story or a super boss zombie demon or some other crap.

125,coreyjdenford,Train of horror,8,28 October 2016,"This is my review of Train to Busan (spoiler free)**** (4/5)AFTER SEVERAL YEARS of the boring, brooding and sort of manipulative over pretentious plotting on The Walking Dead over the last couple of seasons adding some lazy new characters and even lazier walkers, in addition to that the lazy, inept copycats with a lot of action but not enough story or character depth the zombie sub-genre has felt a little bit tired and somewhat overused at points; it needed a breath of fresh air to come back to life thankfully one man writer/director live-action debutant Yeon Sang-ho's Train to Busan brings the fresh air that the sub-genre sorely needed and does it in style. The story is simple and very straightforward as the film opens with Seok woo (Gong Yoo) a man with a workaholic lifestyle as a hedge fund manager and is always absent from his precocious young daughter Soo-an (Kim Soo-an), the two then take a train from their home in Seoul to Busan, at the bottom end of the country but as a suspicious passenger boards the train and what started out as a general commute turns into a train of horrors, as most of the passengers turn into a mass horde of ravenous flesh-eating crazies and the survivors have to survive the vicious attack and outrun the infected to survive.It may sound like a general zombie film with a very familiar premise but the good story and clever plot adds a lot of tension, a masquerade of zombies and high-octane action that refuses to take a break but when it does the film adds in a lot of drama and character depth to points where it's needed. For its length at a total of 118 minutes it is a bit longer than most traditional films of this genre but the pacing of the story is astonishing as for the first 45 minutes it teases the audience with a lot of memorable zombies, action and some terrific heartfelt and harrowing drama that's unpretentious fun. Instead of meeting traditional standards of other zombie subgenres and killing off some new characters as soon as they are introduced as shown in Cell earlier this year this goes with introducing new and important character that are instantly lovable. Two of these characters we meet very early on, a man Song Hwa (Ma Dong-seok) who doesn't take to Seok as soon as he meets him because he thinks that he is just a rich business man who doesn't care for anybody but himself, and his young pregnant wife Sung Gyeong (Jeong Yu-mi), who falls in love with Seok's daughter straightaway. These two characters are instantly lovable and add a lot of drama to the story where it's needed. Though for some parts Song has to put up with Seok and even has to fight through some of the horde in a scene when they are both heading towards a car to find Seok's daughter they have to fight through some of the zombies, however they find out that they can't see in the dark – it's a very enjoyable concept to story that is both action packed and inventive genius as there has other no other film with that kind of intuitive genius. At one point in the second act the train has a stop at Daejeon station and it all seems fine to that passengers and looks like it hasn't been infected but the passengers get attacked by the fast infected, but how fast are they? Imagine Usain Bolt on steroids; that fast. However the survivors don't have guns to defend themselves from the infected which is another enjoyable additional genius to the story as there are far too many zombie sub-genre films that rely on guns for defense, this should be a lesson for Hollywood to take in that guns aren't always a good thing. Although the film isn't flawless not by a long way as the infected are strung together by heavy amounts of CG rubber no, it's not a sequel to World War Z, there is also an elderly man who tries to block Seok and some other survivors out of the rest of the train tries saying that they are infected he's more loud than good and there are zombies that don't die from falling out of a window.The third act is the most dramatic as it offers some heavily impacting heartfelt drama that is guaranteed to make even the most cynical person roll in flood of tears as the train reaches its final descent towards its destination there are some heartbreaking deaths with some of the more lovable characters that leads to an ending which could see a sequel being made that has already been announced. Aside from familiar premise with World War Z and 28 Days Later and the length of the story this is a brilliant, ingenious, and terrifying zombie film that adds a lot of tension with lovable in-depth characters giving brilliant performances, director Yeon Sang-ho's no nonsense story never ceases to deliver and it proves to be just as biting as Bong Joon-ho's dystopian sc-fi thriller Snowpiercer this original story is a breath of fresh air that is better than other Hollywood films of this sub-genre, so we can all breathe again. In short, the zombie sub-genre is back to its best and in terrific style as this could easily one of the best zombie films ever.VERDICT: A purely terrifying, original and no nonsense roller-coaster ride filled with fast paced high-octane action, memorable zombies and harrowing emotion that refuses to stop as it delivers a lot of bite; easily one of the best ever zombie films.8/10 Brilliant.",Train to Busan

This 2016 movie is something unique and original.First of all zombies here are truly scary, they are fast and dangerous and if someone is catched, will probably die. Most characters are likeable and it is easy to bound with most of them, but the movie does not make any discount, if someone has to die, he or she will die, no matter how good he or she is. The movie starts off slowly, in order to introduce context and characters and then buildup gradually the tension.The movie is hard to watch, not for his violent scenes, but because it managed to create a pretty convincing and realistic scenario, if a virus of this kind would exist in our world.

In my view, the Korean acting style can at times be a bit theatrical or melodramatic. But not one beat of Kim Su-an's performance felt false.

133,Rendanlovell,Starts strong only to turn into a typical Hollywood blockbuster.,6,9 December 2016,"Zombie movies aren't quite dead yet. Over the past several years zombies have snuck their way into pop culture, overtaking almost every form of entertainment and putting themselves in the for front as the most beloved ""monster"". There's zombie survival guides, magazines, TV shows, and, of course, movies. 'Train to Busan' is one of those movies. But, as of late, zombies are seeming to wane in popularity. It would seem that the zombie's novelty has started to wear down due to its incredible over-saturation. That being said, when they are done right they remain a rather fun gimmick. Unfortunately, this film is really nothing more than that.It's a fun gimmicky movie that doesn't do too much else. But while it lasts, it's a blast. The film almost immediately gets started showing the slow beginnings of the outbreak. A couple burning buildings, some emergency vehicles darting around, and the occasional convulsing person. This type of first act isn't new or different by any means but it's the fact that we get into the action within ten minutes that makes this movie instantly enjoyable.Despite the dumb family dynamic that the film introduces the opening forty-ish minutes is probably the most visceral action in a movie so far this year. This is largely thanks to the actual filmmaking. The camera-work is all extremely fluid and interesting. There is rarely a moment when I saw a shot and thought it looked bad. The director uses the camera to help build tension instead of just throwing in loud sounds and music.It also helps when the makeup effects and performances are as well done as they are. Obviously, there is a fair amount of blood in this here movie and it's used sparring enough to help heighten a scene, instead just being the scene. And the actors that get the nice close ups as the zombies all do a wonderful job selling it. There are multiple wonderful moments when the zombies fling themselves down thrashing wildly.The best moment is definitely when an army man throws himself off the train and breaks his arm. It just dangles behind his head as he gets up and takes off running. It's these wonderful little touches that make this film enjoyable over a 'World War Z' type of movie. But not everything works in this movie. The script is particularly messy. This feels far closer to a big budget Hollywood movie, except without the budget.The most noticeable bad aspect of the film is the visual effects. Even though the majority of the film takes place on the actual train, there are plenty of times when we move off of said train and the run down world comes into focus. What we get are mostly unconvincing effects that hinder more than help. Fortunately, they are used sparring enough to not be a huge issue.But, like I said earlier, this film's script is specifically poor. This mainly stems from the emotional manipulation that it has. It tries to offer characters that you like but it doesn't develop on them. They are people that have families and the film expects you to just like them for no reason. And since you are supposed to like them for no reason it tries hard to have tear jerking moments.Every time it does, they are horribly predictable and nothing more than manipulative. It pauses the film to have the sappy music and the zoom ins as the characters pretend have emotional moments. Every time this happened, and it does far to often, I just wanted to punch the movie in face and yell, ""GET ON WITH IT!"" If you want to have these moments in your movie, that's fine, but you need to have well- written characters. Or just go non-stop balls to the wall action.And that's where this movie fails. It tries desperately hard to be both action packed and emotional. When you try this hard to strike a balance, one aspect or another will suffer at any given time. Every time the film slows down to have characters talk, I just wanted to die. It affects the pacing in the worst way possible by making this a boring yet fun movie. It's definitely enjoyable to watch and it has a lot of great elements. If you like zombie movies or action oriented movies, you'll probably like this one, but for anyone else watch 'Dawn of the Dead' again.",Train to Busan

137,themadmovieman,"Not only a brilliant zombie blockbuster, but enthralling and riveting all the way through",8,7 September 2017,"In what is easily the best zombie movie in recent years, Train To Busan proves an enormously entertaining watch at every minute, featuring twists and turns galore to the backdrop of an intensely action-packed battle for survival, yet still with an incredible amount of emotion and heart, thanks to some very well-developed characters and strong performances throughout.There's a lot to love about this movie, but I'm going to start off with why it makes the zombie genre, one that often falls flat, really work. For me, zombie movies are regularly frustrating watches, proving to be nothing more than two hours of running away from a mass of mildly threatening things, and never really allowing for anything different to spark genuine interest or excitement.Fortunately, what Train To Busan does is keep the simplest and most effective characteristics of the zombie genre, but make sure that it never loses sight of what makes a good film. As a result, while there's so much fantastic zombie action, and some properly intense violence that makes the undead far more threatening villains than normal, it's the film's story that really makes it work so well.Above all, the depth of character development is the biggest success of the whole film. Starting off with a concise and interesting introduction to our main characters, looking at a father obsessed with his work and how that has alienated his own daughter, the film doesn't languish about when it comes to being more thorough, but the background that it does give you is absolutely vital for the rest of the film.Following on from the father and daughter, we're introduced just as efficiently to a couple of other major characters on the train that will be integral to the fight for survival, and it's the fact that get a genuine emotional insight into each of them that means you can really fear for them in this situation, and will them to survive against what seem like impossible odds.Throughout, the film proves itself bold and daring by making sure no major characters are 100% safe, and that means you're sitting on an emotional knife-edge at every moment. It's not the action and pace that makes this film a thrilling watch, but the fact that you're so enthralled in the story, and each and every turn proves yet another incredible twist.The performances in this film are also just as strong. The excellent character development is matched by a selection of both likable and brilliantly dastardly performances across the board, and although that doesn't always excuse the occasional stupid character decision to advance the plot, it reinforces your emotional connection to the leads, and with the likes of Gong Yoo and Ma Dong-seok in particular putting in fantastic turns, you won't be able to look away from the movie's fantastic heroes.And finally, I can't forget to say that this movie is a hell of a lot of fun. Its drama may be enthralling, and its emotion powerful, but it's still a playful and hyperbolic zombie movie that will put as much of a smile on your face as put you on the edge of your seat. It's not a downbeat, apocalyptic disaster movie like World War Z or so many Hollywood zombie flicks, but rather a vivacious and rapid-fire blockbuster full of life and humour to go along with its excellent story.Overall, I was absolutely thrilled by Train To Busan. An incredibly entertaining movie that outdoes almost every zombie movie before it, it impresses with excellent performances and directing, and a story that prioritises enthralling characters and genuine drama over simple thrills and spills, but still leaves time for a load of great zombie action.",Train to Busan
138,christian94,More than a Zombie Movie and a Good One at That + History of Zombie,9,8 May 2017,"(If you want to skip zombie pseudo-history, please go directly to the fourth paragraph for the film) Train to Busan (2016) is the ""best Zombie movie ever"" like a few reviews mentioned, but I am not a particular zombie movie fan. In fact I may have seen a dozen and do not watch The Walking Dead (2010) but do highly recommend ""Men Against Fire"" episode of British Black Mirror (2011) sci-fi TV series as a perfect example of social, philosophical, psychological and political warfare examination with a mutant premise, akin to zombie in some aspects. Korean anthology of short films Doomsday Book (2012) had ""A Brave New World"" segment that dealt with Seoul zombies in a thoughtful, sensitive way, while Robert Rodriguez's Planet Terror (2007) film (segment of Grindhouse) was the best zombie movie before Train to Busan (2016). They surpass classics DAY OF THE DEAD (1985), 28 DAYS LATER (2002) and DAWN OF THE DEAD (2004) but I haven't seen George A. Romero's DAWN OF THE DEAD (1978) or his earlier NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD (1968). Re-Animator (1985), Dead Alive (1992), Shaun of the Dead (2004) and Zombieland (2009) are supposed to be lots of fun. The Evil Dead (1981) and The Evil Dead II (1987) are excellently cheesy and gory and zombie-like enough to include here.Yet, from all these United States (US) and United Kingdom (UK) productions, perfection of the craft within the genre has not been reached. Western origins of Zombies (Haitian voodoo) and Vampires (Eastern Europe) and popularization in the US and Western Europe has not allowed a fresh look at the genre (fresh flesh?). Now Asian cinema is taking things to the next level with its innovation and history with effective horror. A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night (2014) and Jee-woon Kim's Coming Out (2001) are some example of the best Vampire tales every shown and they are from Iran and Korea.Train to Busan (2016) is a zombie film that is also a great action movie and a drama that holds its own weight. The characters are admittedly mostly one-dimensional but the dramatic action, moments, movements and details make it memorable and palpable. The main relationship is a failed father-daughter relationship that is fleshed out enough to be felt at many crucial moments of the film. Secondary characters are also important and contribute greatly to the narrative and emotions. The couple expecting a baby are the perfect counterpart to our main characters while other (regular or bizarre passengers, train personnel, baseball players) play adequate parts. The suspense is real even if you need some suspension of belief at many moments! This is an action-packed ride and expertly paced. The dilemmas are non-stop and drama keeps unfolding until the final frame. Zombies are scary and cool, the cinematography and special effects play well into the narrative. The tension is well created and the twists and turns keep on coming even if a few or far-fetched or questionable, the majority of the story is strong and holds together. More than anything this is a fun, fast and relentless ride with people we get to care about in an impossible situation after the other. What movies are made for, more or less. In this case: more!No reused Resident Evil (2002) profitable but predictably poor franchise here. I hope to also check out the animated work from the same director including a companion piece zombie movie set in Seoul...",Train to Busan
139,CountJonnie,Collision course with zombies.....and emotions,6,17 February 2019,"Train to Busan is a decent zombie movie that focusses less on horror/gore, and more on people and emotions. Without a real intro, the watcher is thrown in the middle of the movie, already overrun by zombies, while a group of survivors try to escape by train. But the horrors continu on the train, as it seems that zombies are not the only monsters.The effectiveness of this movie is thanks to the great actors who portray the spastic and quick zombies, without relying on gore. Another effect is the amazing acting by father and daughter, pregnant woman and boyfriend, and the ""evil"" rich man who doesn't care about others. The movie obviously focusses on humanity, choises and effects.That's also the flaw of the movie. After a while it becomes repetitive and the roles become cliche. The ""evil"" rich man becomes a cliche to a point that it becomes caricatural. This doesn't bring the movie down, because the pacing is so fast, that you'll never get bored or stuck in a situation. Train to Busan is still one of the better zombie movies in years.",Train to Busan
140,shashrvacai,Amazing Zombie Film,8,12 April 2020,I think concept of Zombies is stupid and shallow. But i understand that it has an entertainment value. This is a great film about a pandemic. With just enough of Korean drama to keep you Captivated throughout the film. According to me it is a must watch for any film goer. I came across this film through Woo-sik Choi's Filmography and I am not disappointed.,Train to Busan

Layered, emotional, and riveting, the South Korean product blends human drama, thematic depth, and jolting horror in its tale of commuters trapped within a train while an epidemic rages without. The production is sleek, the violence is biting, and the characters are worth investment.

It was dull. I couldn't stop laughing when I wasn't supposed to. I annoyed my brother with this Ill advised laughter so much he moved away from me. For comedy value alone and the last 20 minutes where there were hardly any zombies and some humanity (the best bit of the film) I'll give it a flesh eating 5 out of ten. Don't let that put you off. I hated 28 days later which was apparently a masterpiece in zombie filmmaking history. That too, was dull. Zombies don't exist, metaphorically or literally.

146,TheRedDeath30,Full Bore Zombie Frenzy,8,20 March 2017,"I know. I know. If you are anything like me, you are sick to death of zombie movies. Many will rise to defend the sub-genre of horror. After all, there are only so many tropes and monsters that you can explore. In the same breath, one could say you are tired of vampire movies or ghost movies, but the fact is that I would say I am tired of all three. Maybe ""tired"" isn't the right word. I am skeptical. I have seen the originals that created the structures, the next wave of zombie films that re-defined what you could do with it, then every twist on the genre directors could come up with, from comedies like SHAUN OF THE DEAD to dramatic presentations like MAGGIE. Mostly, I am tired of every indie film maker with no better idea then to do a zombie flick devoid of imagination. So, it really takes a lot to impress me at this point, which makes it all the more surprising that TRAIN TO BUSAN is able to do just that.There are two major things that make this movie work incredibly well, the action and the characters. The action elements of this movie is what will get it attention from the largest segment of audience. The fact that this is the first live-action film for the director is even more impressive. He cut his teeth in animation and it definitely shows. The movie has a kinetic sense of action and pacing that is straight out of an action cartoon. The movie feels almost like a comic book or cartoon come to life, in many ways. I could make many bad train puns here, but the movie feel like a ride on a steam train. It starts off slow and plodding, setting up the story, the characters and the angles and the movie slowly picks up more and more speed, until arriving at a fever pitch towards the end. That action is gripping and once it hooks you in, it doesn't let go. You will be on the edge of your seat as the movie takes you for a ride.I said, earlier, that the action would hook the largest audience. Plenty of people just want an action-packed film and there is nothing wrong with that, but I know my friends in the horror intelligentsia will want a little something more on their plates, and this movie does not fail to deliver in character. The plot is pretty straight forward, zombies on a train, but what makes the movie really special is the characters. The plot revolves around a workaholic dad who agrees to take his young daughter to see his ex- wife. We see that the two have a very strained relationship, which naturally evolves through the course of the film. Along the way, we pick up additional characters. There is the drifter that portends the action and plays a pivotal part. The tough bruiser and his pregnant wife, who are important pieces in the relationships that will develop and prove to be much deeper than they appear in the surface. There is an a*hole businessman, who will sacrifice anyone to save himself. To a less defined degree, the baseball player and the girl who wants to be his girlfriend, who aren't as fleshed out as other characters, but provide a few interesting scenes.Many zombie purists will not like the direction of the zombies themselves. At the risk of incurring the endless, tired debate of which are the best zombies, you could argue these aren't zombies, at all. They are ""infected"". They are much closer to rabid, chaotic horde of the DAWN remake, or more so, WORLD WAR Z, than the shambling undead of the original DAWN OF THE DEAD, or even THE WALKING DEAD. That last comparison is an interesting one. For all the people on social media complaining that the popular show is too slow, too boring, too talkative and there isn't enough focus on the zombies, this is almost the antidote. Full of action and full of zombies.The movie has two big things going against it for a western audience, it's sub-titled and it's another zombie film. For that reason alone, many will avoid it. They would be doing themselves a big disservice as this movie is one of the best of last year and a great modern zombie flick.",Train to Busan
147,youngcollind,Breathing new life into a crowded genre,8,11 June 2021,"Train to Busan doesn't reinvent the wheel so much as it plays to the strengths of what can make a zombie film entertaining.

149,FelipeCarrillo,One of The Most Sound Inspections Inside Horror Sub-Genre,6,22 January 2017,"Current walkers' genre arises from horror/survival films chiefly, which located its golden years at the end of the 1960s, where the sub- genre genesis was cemented with a brand new and unique solvency, the same one that slaughters the audience as genuine vultures without any substance. Although there's not an accurate date about when it was considered preeminent in the celluloid world, but we do know the three men who reflected heterogeneity and universal depth that an undead horde may originate. The first man was who took the chance to emit an uncommon conception at that time, where demise was not the conclusion in the lifeline, but one cycle more for transfiguring itself into testimonial detriment. George A. Romero, he was who opened the pathway with a must-see crowning work, essential for anyone who is adept to the heterodox category. A few years later, Danny Boyle built a task titivated with ingredients with which we were already getting familiar, however, they were endowed its work with collective and psychological idiosyncrasy; the above made us apprehended the same nature viewed from an opposed and eccentric perspective. And finally, three years ago moderately, Marc Forster propelled zombie theme to extremist and utter crippling visual dimensions —it's so like Hollywood, — nevertheless, he also managed to impregnate it a relevant dramatic connotation. It is, in fact, a shame that among hundreds of projects which are both crowded together on the small screen as on the big screen, only these three cases truly get to be more than an ephemeral film; a film with justifications, rudiments, soul and laconic structure.Yeon Sang-ho's ""Train to Busan"" or ""Busanhaeng"" (original title), glorified formidably by key contests in the issue, exposes and pours strategically concerning and globally significant thesis into a top- level artistic and choreographic majesty, nonetheless, the movie expressed neither something substantially divergent nor fresh in cinematic terms, what categorizes it as an entertaining, effective and somewhat nugatory film. Cannes and Sitges opened the doors to the director, newcomer in live-action movies—since his previous works have been clearly animated, among them is the initial part of this story, ""Seoul Station"", screened at BIFFF, serves as outbreak and exordium within this atmosphere, — to testify his assiduity and supremacy in this classification; These festivals intensified significantly commercial splendor through Word-of-mouth marketing (WOMM) around the film, drawing more than 11 million in attendance just in Korea.In essence, the storyline takes place inside of a train which departs from Seoul; place in where an opportunist and self-centered father is constricted by his daughter to buy two tickets for a prolonged travel in the carriages; she longs vehemently for visiting her mother in Busan, South Korea's second most-populous city and in where this public transport has delimited its arrival.The quandary is that in the morning, an abnormal virulence, stirred up by main character's biochemical corporation, charges against Korean residents of an intense and enraged way, originating a hair-raising maelstrom territorial.While they thought that in comfort of their train indemnity was infallible, one infected sneaks in the rear coach inducing an out-of-control derangement; the only hope for passengers is to arrive as soon as possible to Busan, site where a hypothetical military shelter sits, however, the walkers are not the worst catastrophe, human begins' apocalypse and corruption is it.The film is closely influenced by two antithesis managed of clever way at least mostly: in the first place, narrative proposal is fully foreign along with comic and western popular culture references; and in the second place, characters are significantly oriental, which connect with other factors correctly, among them stand out superb mise-en-scène—which no longer has any reason to ""envy"" American cinematic mecca, —an impetuous soundtrack supplying exuberance, a relevant dramatic talent and a final act that derails its film and plot ambitions beyond its own limits, to a certain point.The huge and mundane obstacle is it adjusts and stretches on genre clichés, providing entertainment without offering something little know, equally, the slow-pace beginning and over-the-top sensitive moments reduce the fantastic results from the first 45 minutes.Once again, it argues unexplored—or at least, unseen— aptitude of oriental cinema. ""Train to Busan"" is a well-made rail travel with zombie thematic which subverts in its narrative threads individualism, disparate social conditions, selfishness and lack of concern for the welfare of the other, issues punching our contemporary society every morning. ""Busanhaeng"" represents all what a roamer film lover aspires to see, however, manipulates the used components with one different hand, creating a splendid visual beauty to generate such feeling. Refreshing, captivating and even entertaining; the film is as frantic and direct as the same train.",Train to Busan

As the train goes it all went down rapidly, with attacks and spreading of zombies through train it's pure horror and violence. Some of very impressive scenes were in the movie like one when zombies are chasing the train and grab it creating a long line of them holding onto it. There was also a character that was wisely put in the movie a perfectly used later at the end of it, as guy that seemed like homeless sacrificed his life for pregnant women and Soo- an. Movie also showed in some scenes it's dramatic aspect of it where sacrifices were made.

159,ctowyi,Board this train!,8,4 August 2016,"This is one fantastic train ride. I love the creative ideas and the economical character setups. No need for too much heavy top-down moralization. This is a straight-up disaster flick with zombies coming in swarms from all directions. So we already know the archetypal characters - the coward, the brave one, the pregnant one, the youth in love, the heroic one and so on. The fun is in seeing which one will die first and who will live. This train is loaded with some colorful characters. Putting 80% of the action on a bullet train didn't constraint the wealth of inventive ideas one bit as the commuters escape the crazy zombies from car to car. The momentum is terrific and I kept marveling at all creative problem-solving; some I have never seen before. The character arc of the main actor from narcissistic anti-hero to titular hero is very potent and what injects the narrative with much forward power. Love the subtext of class and government hypocrisy, class division, vileness of human nature and the dreaded herd mentality. Ya ya ya, I know the movie never delves too deep into them. Because that would rob the movie of its relentless momentum. I think Paul Greengrass who made Jason Bourne needs to study the cinematography here. You don't need to do split-second cuts and shake the camera to make the audience feel in-the-moment. The action set-pieces are so well choreographed that I understand and see everything. Straits Times (my local papers) said the last act is disappointing with the train derailing, crashing into some cliché-obstacles and careening through melodramatic territory. Hello? This is Korean cinema - melodrama is expected and in this case welcomed with open arms. IMHO the first two acts are so explosively fun and rollicking thrilling that it practically earned its melodramatic ending. Heck! I was nearly tearing up. This is one of the most entertaining and unpretentious zombie movies I have seen in a while. This is one train you need to board.",Train to Busan

161,ivko,"snakes on a plane, zombies on the train",6,29 January 2019,"The 'zombie apocalypse' genre has a long history of packing social commentary alongside the scares. I would even go so far as to say the best movies always have a point they are trying to make. But that being said, you need a light touch or it risks becoming a glorified lecture. To paraphrase Futurama, when you do things right, people won't be sure you did anything at all. Unfortunately, with this movie even the dimmest audience member will know exactly what the movie is doing by the five minute mark because its messaging has all the subtlety of one of its Zeds.But I'm getting ahead of myself. The movie, set in South Korea (dialogue is also Korean so native English speakers like myself will need subtitles), follows the passengers of a train headed to Busan which starts off just as the news starts getting a little weird. This part of the movie is done quite well, with the characters observing emergency vehicles speeding towards distant fires, odd crowds at the train station, and the occasional person running past in a panic without any obvious source for their distress. Things escalate quickly, however, and soon the characters are in the classic survival scenario.The movie follows the perspective of several characters, but the ""main"" character is a young overworked father taking his daughter to see his estranged wife. Exposition scenes inform us that despite the wealth and stature he's achieved as a hedge fund manager, his familial relationships are strained due to his heavy workload. His daughter in particular wastes no opportunity to reject him or badmouth him to strangers for his ""selfishness"".In broad strokes this theme of ""selfishness is bad"" isn't completely foreign to American cinema. In a western film the guy who refuses to stick his neck out for fellow survivors or hordes resources would probably be expected by the audience to face some comeuppance, but the version here is pretty strict. Just having the job of hedge manager earns the scorn of other characters because it made him wealthy, and his own daughter rejects him openly after he attempts to use his influence to keep her safe without also trying to help everyone else. Even his investment strategy earns him a call accusing him of responsibility for the actions of a company in his portfolio.The movie keeps hammering on this point the whole way through. For example, there's also a scene that takes place after the main character has 'learned his lesson' that showcases a whole group of 'selfish' people which ends very predictably. My problem is that after a while it begins to feel contrived, like they are forcing characters to act in ways that aren't logical or reasonable just so they can line up another parable for the audience.Fortunately, a lot of the other aspects of the movie are well done and make up for the weaker elements. The movie is deeply atmospheric and beautifully shot, really conveying the unsettling feeling of a society in full breakdown. Simple things like the conductor communicating with traffic controllers effectively spread unease as the conversations gradually reveal the isolation of the train and its passengers in a world going dark. Dialogue is minimalist but efficient, portraying fear and grief but sprinkling in enough humor to keep it from becoming overbearing. And the main danger, the zombies, are well designed and executed, being scary enough to keep you on edge and utilized for more than simple jump scares.The ending kind of made me sigh, and the little girl wasn't so much cute as grating, but the ending was earned by the story. I would say that as far as these types of movies go, it was fairly original and interesting. Expect to feel a little lectured at but mostly still have a good time.",Train to Busan

From the original Night of the Living Dead till now, I thought we'd run zombie films into the ground and that we'd seen the last of anything interesting, never mind frightening, but this adrenaline rush proves me wrong. A slow build that just keeps building for two hours, this is as tense a horror film that I've seen in a very long time. There's not much to tell about the plot. The dead are coming back to life and you'd better run! Or in this case, take the train. This is a masterful piece of filmmaking with relentless suspense, half or more of the time in a confined space. After a while, it becomes clear that CGI is involved, but you'd never know it's done so well. Some of the characters are stereotypes and some of the dialogue, or at least the sub-titles, are clunky and some of it is illogical, a funny thing to say about a zombie movie, but this is top notch entertainment for those into such things. The acting is nothing special by the cast other than the lead actor who slowly evolves from one kind of man to another convincingly. This is a truly exciting film. Excellent cinematography as well.

The story arcs of the characters quite bold and and I was shocked at times as to the casualties. Nobody is safe in this movie. I found myself towards the end quite unsettled.

Where is it safest as the epidemic is underway? Inside the train on the move or outside? Survivors try as hard as they can to keep the zombies restricted in some wagons of the train, but for how long? An endless journey, where the destination is doubtful. Very good script development, building some characters, others with ideals, others altruistic and others extremely selfish. Who will finally manage to survive? Will there be justice?

There's a virus or infection in Korea, people get bitten, turn into scary fast zombies (28 Days Later like), and mass chaotic fear breaks out.

On the other hand, the movie was tame, simplistic, and devolved into a typical Hollywood style blockbuster, with none of the nuance and tact usually found in S.Korean movies. I had heard such great things about this film, and as excited as I was to see it, I just could not shake the feeling that it was limited by either the producer, the country, or the creative team. Where it could have been gruesome and disturbing, it aimed to be tame and heartfelt. I don't care about the human condition when it comes to Zombie films. I care about the Zombie's, who they kill, and how vicious they could get away with showing it.The acting was superb, and the cinematography was indicative of a very talented creative team. Why this didn't yield a more transcendent and original film, I will never understand. It really did seem like the team wanted to do something grandiose, but kept their reigns pulled back in order to not offend, disturb, or frighten their audience. Basically, a Zombie movie that isn't frightening just isn't worth your time. While Train to Busan was a great film (even by South Korean Standards), it could have been so, so much more. At it stands, it is simply an entertaining film from a talented team of creators and actors, and I suppose that this should be enough for any fan of horror films to give it a watch.FYI; If you want to see a truly entertaining, graphic and unique Zombie film, I would suggest watching the Japanese movie ""I Am A Hero"". It is objectively the best Zombie film of 2016, and deserve any real horror fans time and attention. It blows this movie so far out of the water, that it is not even a contest.",Train to Busan

Unlike ""the Dead"" series of George Romero or ""Return of the Living Dead"" series, which are the two major series in the genre, this one does not involve comedy and in addition, the suspense is maintained all the time without digressions. The story is as simple as it can be, that is, a zombie assault breaks out in Korea and spreads quickly to cities and to a train traveling from Seoul to Busan. It has some emotional content and also some twists through the ending. The movie also has a realistic sense as to how people can be cruel against each other under high oppression.",Train to Busan
169,FKDZ,Doesn't really do anything new.,5,29 July 2021,"Alternative title for this movie would be ''Zombies on a Train''. In general, its not a bad movie. The stunts, visuals and directing carry it a lot.The main downfall of this movie is the plot though, and the many, many plot holes. Just... too many too count. Additionally the obscure choices some characters made. The dialog is fine.. though not my native language so I find that hard to judge.The visuals are great, the zombies are fast and freaky and there is definitely a ''threat'' in this movie.The overall plot and story though, like I said, was meh at best. I really couldn't agree with some of the decisions made later in the movie, especially after a very important phone call plot wise which just isn't followed up upon with something creative.The script does contain a ton of cliché moments, which also make the movie very predictable and boring at times even though overall its paced well imo.The music... big letdown, felt cheesy and cheap most of the time. Audio design was your typical zombie stuff, also pretty boring.That said this is a first for me seeing a SK film, so if anything, its really good for that.So yeah, pretty meh from me, 5/10.",Train to Busan

172,SpoilerAlertReviews,"""Tickets Please""",9,12 November 2016,"""We are sorry to announce, that the 9:53 service to Waterloo has been cancelled due to a zombie outbreak"" fortunately, for us in the UK, the chances for widespread outbreak via train networks is somewhat diminished due to strike action, bad weather and foliage on the tracks. (Joking aside, I actually like and praise our public transport and yes, I have and do, use it a lot) We've had bombs on the bus, terrorists on a ship, snakes on a plane and now, zombies on a train. Korean animation director, Sang-ho Yeon gives us his live action feature debut which happens to be a sequel his animated feature, Seoul Station that came out earlier this year. There's no doubt, Sang-ho knows this genre well and all the elements of great zombie movies are predominantly there, especially the anxiety you feel for the characters being ferociously chased, willing them to ""hurry the f$% up"" and moments of sudden disappointment when people are bitten or lost. It's like The Walking Dead cramped into one carriage. It's an obvious storyline, that's doesn't really derail however, fortunately, that doesn't mean it's a total predictable fare, because it isn't. There's some clever elements that set a brilliant premise for key scenes and fights for survival. But in a nutshell, zombie outbreak, that leaks onto a fast moving train. The characters are brilliant and are a mixture of flawed unlikely heroes that perform outrageous heroics in order to survive and protect their loved ones. Central to father and daughter, They meet a multitude of other commuters that's reminiscent of classic disaster movies like the Poseidon Adventure or Tremors. Yoo Gong plays the neglectful father who reluctantly escorts his daughter to Busan; the daughter played by Soo-an Kim, who is simply amazing being the kind-hearted, curious and fearful child. Dong-seok Ma has to be my favourite and you'll see why, as he punches his way through the hordes of undead; the platform rush in particular was epic. There's one character who is so awful, I have not hated any other character quite so much since the dickless Walter Peck from Ghostbusters. But there's the typical business man, pregnant lady, granny, baseball- bat tottling teenagers and a hobo among the passengers. There's actually quite a lot of emotional content, with some selfish stupidity and righteous retribution. The chemistry between the characters is conveyed greatly with dilemmas, difference of opinion and fear either dividing them apart or bringing them together. The zombies themselves come as standard issue, usual makeup, script and costume, and as zombies come, they look and act the part superbly, but what makes these a slightly different breed from your usual face-munchers is their unnatural movement, which can only really be described as body-popping, like the casted a bunch of street dancers to play the zombies adding a more quirky and grotesque style of zombie. It's pure brilliance and class, and certainly one of the best zombie movies I've seen. Incredibly action-packed for the 118min runtime and doesn't let up from the moment you first encounter the infected. A must for all zombie fans.

173,sitenoise,As much quality as a Movie Trailer,4,20 September 2016,"There's the re-animating deer near the beginning; the first few overflowing zombie pile-ups; several great contortion moves; a fantastic fiery Locomotive crash; a hilariously great zombie herd tailgate surf. What am I missing? That's about three minutes of quality movie. A Movie Trailer's worth. And like a movie trailer it's a terrible representation of the film overall--where the other 99% is a T-bomb.The pacing of the film is defecating: Zombies run into a door that's being closed; everyone takes a dump. Lather rinse repeat. The pacing is bad because the writing and acting are awful. ""But you're not supposed to have writing and acting in a zombie movie!"" That's right. So why shove it in our faces? Jung Yu-Mi gets a pass, and I liked the little girl. Ma Dong-Seok doesn't embarrass himself too much because he's strong enough to overcome what he's given. Every line of dialog in the film is bad. Gong Yoo is a twerpy faux-stud who can't act his way out of a genre film. I hope to never watch another film with his over-moisturized face.I had high hopes for this. The three minutes of quality film are fantastic. End of story. Well, actually I like the Korean thing of killing everyone, although I'm not saying if the kid dies or not (like the one in *The Host* did). Korea might be inching toward doing Hollywood better than Hollywood, but it's still crap. I, and I can't believe I'm saying this, enjoyed *The Happening* (2008) more than this.

176,TheRadiobox,The longest train ride in the shortest time,6,16 June 2020,"Train to Busan is directed by Sang-ho Yeon and follows a father and daughter on a train to... well, Busan. Only there is an infection that spreads and makes this train ride a little more stressful than the norm. The film starts a little bit clunky and unintentionally funny, with a shot of a zombified deer looking directly at the camera just a little too long. Just enough to make it feel accidental.The plot is familiar: a zombie infection/virus/bio-weapon that causes sweeping destruction and forces people to find safe zones to hide out until the threat is contained or eliminated. It's all familiar stuff. The father-daughter relationship is well-defined in a short amount of time, nothing surprising, but it works. The first infected on the train gets on a little too luckily for my liking, slipping behind a worker in the loudest and most conspicuous way and he doesn't even look. And she stumbles around the train with veins popping out and making noises the whole way through. Again, no one notices. That initial zombie is functional as a catalyst on the train and works to get the story where it needs to go.From the first infection on the train and beyond the tension is held, but not the pacing. There's lulls where time is given to think about what happened prior; which should be effectively emotional, but there are only really 5 main characters, and some of them don't get much in the way of characterization. And there are also some situations where the tone feels a bit off. Jokes are present but it's difficult to discern whether or not they're supposed to be out of nervousness or just bad writing. The writing of situations is well done for the most part, but there are characters such as the man in a green jacket that serve no purpose and only exist to up the ante.Train to Busan has some interesting ideas such as zombies only being attracted to people when they can see, the survivors using newspaper and darkness when in tunnels to navigate. When the darkness ends, the zombies immediately know where the characters are. This would be great if it was consistent. Other times it is made to look like the zombies are attracted by only noise. There are moments where the zombies should be attracted to characters but aren't for the sake of the plot. Infection times fair the same way, sometimes it takes minutes for someone to turn and other times it's instant. It seems as though the zombies only follow the rules when it's convenient or to set up tension that doesn't need setting up. Aside from this aspect, the zombies are conventional and well-explained.Technical aspects are mostly solid, with lighting and camera work capturing the scenes fully and competently. The sound is appropriately gruesome with each bite, bone-crunch, and punch being felt. There is clearly some CGI used in some sequences and most of the time it sticks out like a sore thumb but it never takes away the impact of the film.Performances are harder for me to gauge with the film being in Korean (a language I have no experience with and there are no parallels to English) but from the emotions being shown by each character were fitted to each situation. Sometimes the characters make supremely stupid decisions that, again, are only made to raise tension when it is already high.As a whole Train to Busan makes for an engaging yet familiar ride. The film has good ideas but is inconsistent with its usage of them. Everything is competent and mostly unsurprising, but entirely watchable. If you like zombie movies this will probably be for you.63/100",Train to Busan

I would say that it is better than Dawn of the Dead. The movie has non-stop thrills, nonstop kills, nonstop action and nonstop emotion. We get to know each character one by one and bit by bit but the main focus here was Seok-woo (Yoo Gong) and his daughter Soo-Ann (Su-An Kim). Their journey to survive the zombie apocalypse made you want them both to live. Along the way we meet many other interesting characters and a very horrifying villain by the name of Yon-suk (Eui-sung Kim). He is by far the most nastiest, greediest and most coldest person you will probably ever meet. He kills so many people along the way in order to save himself from the zombies. The movie is just beyond incredible and it's way better than any is zombie Hollywood movie That we've ever seen! The makeup and effects are just incredible and so passes and he zombie movie with seen since Dawn of the Dead. Only problem English people may have with it is that it is in North Korean subtitles but that didn't bother us one bit as we don't mind reading subtitles.

182,danielharden,Last Train Home,9,30 October 2017,"The horror genre has its fair share of hits and misses, however, it would seem that the sub genre of zombie horror suffers from the greatest ratio of misses to hits. Yes, the genre does have George A Romero's Night of the living dead and Dawn of the dead, as well as, spoof film Shaun of the Dead, but it would appear that is all we have. One must think hard to find a decent zombie film that doesn't end in ""of the dead""... Until now. Director, Sang-ho Yeon makes his live-action debut with what is in my opinion, the best zombie horror film ever. 2016's Train to Busan, or Busanhaeng as it's pronounced in its native country of South Korea, is more than just a simple zombie film, it's ultimately about evaluating what matters most in life, as well as being a social commentary of Korea's government and perhaps even our own.Train to Busan's success as a horror film could be boiled down to a singular detail, character development. Countless horror films don't take the time to establish and expand upon their characters, resulting in little to no tension, people you more or less want to die and the audience's overall detachment from the film. The social messages of Train to Busan demand fully realised characters for them to have an impact, and fortunately, the filmmakers choose to flesh out a number of characters rather than a limited few. The film's main protagonist, Seok-woo, is a father who prioritises his work over his family, now having again disappointed his daughter, Soo-an, Seok-woo reluctantly agrees to take Soo-an to see her mother in Busan for her birthday, but of course, the zombie outbreak makes things a little bit more difficult The film is primarily the journey, pardon the pun, of Seok-woo as he's forced to be the protecting father he wasn't pre-outbreak and witness the consequences of his actions as a fat cat businessman. As well as this, the film features a married couple expecting their first child, however, the father has yet to name the baby. I for one, found the couple and their love for each other to be the most impactful and engaging. Train to Busan also features; a sports team where one member and a cheerleader have an off and on relationship, two elderly sisters who care deeply for one another and a selfish business owner who I believe represents the ruling class in Asia. Train to Busan is rich with subtext, making it more of a mental and emotional journey than a physical one.In addition to the emotional message of human life matters most, Train to Busan is contextually relevant in the modern day. With North and South Korea technically still at war having never signed a peace treaty, but more importantly, North Korea's constant threat of nuclear attacks and Donald Trump Well Doing what he does best as president, adding fuel to the fire and being racist So it's safe to say things are pretty sh*t in Korea at the moment. Train to Busan takes aim at the ruling class, from the fat cat businessmen like our protagonist to the government itself, controlling the media and thus the people to fit with their political agenda. The continent of Asia is no stranger to censorship and unquestioned authority figures such as dictators, and so I believe Sang-ho Yeon is attempting to highlight the errors of totalitarianism by effectively bringing a ruling class man to the ground, to see the errors of his ways and the ways of those like him. The shoe is on the other foot and together with the breathtaking performances from the films cast along with the films character development, this message is made all the more powerful.It isn't all serious however, there is a lot of fun to be had and the film is incredibly entertaining. The action set pieces throughout Train to Busan are large in scale, visually stunning and seriously impressive. Visceral imagery takes the place of cheap jump scares in this competently directed action horror film. Yeon wants to scare you with the culturally relevant subtext, in conjunction with horrifying imagery, instead of simply relying on a loud noise. Director Sang-ho Yeon also understands the horror genre, its themes and concept. It's all about fear, but not just of a killer, a ghost, a vampire or zombie etc. Horror can be the fear of anything and Yeon has made a film that is more about the fear of failing as a parent, disappointing your family and fearing for your country, than it is about the fear of zombies. The human fear amongst the supernatural is what truly makes Train to Busan the best of its genre.The world is a scary place. The divides between the rich and the poor remain intact and the threat of war is ever-present. Yet humanity does exist, there is light in the darkness we just have to open our eyes to the horror of others. Train to Busan is a poignant, relevant and phenomenal film which takes the audience on the same emotional journey as its characters. It's an extremely tense film thanks in no small part to the phenomenal cast and use of character development. This film can be read on a number of levels, I just hope people see it for what it truly is, a social and political statement highlighting the lack of humanity seen in the modern day.",Train to Busan

It's just what I say lazy writing. No character development (urggh I know this is a zombie movie but still) Somehow few small events are supposed to define the characters present in the movie. But that's not how things work. If you are selfishly saving your ass and then suddenly if a girl lectures you to ""always think about others"", you can't become the Hero of the Humanity in a second. You can't write full character arcs in a film which is just showing events of few hours. (I mean you can but you need to be a very great writer to pull that off, in this case it wasn't). And just because of this lack of character development, I wasn't entirely rooting for anyone to get saved (to be honest there were times when I was wishing no one survives in the train).And what is this obsession of killing each and every character in overtly melodramatic way? I get it people are dying. But if that is happening so frequently as in this movie then I can't cry for every character's death.The only thing which was impressing were the zombies. No back story.

The daughter wants to ride the train by herself to Busan, the father decides he needs to go with her to try and save what little is left on his relationship with his daughter.Once on the train the fun truly begins. The ""zombies"" are relentless and people turn quite quickly after being bitten which I thought was awesome. Another aspect of the zombies was when the train would go through tunnels, the zombies effectively go blind. When a group of survivors need to get through a few of the train cars they use this to their advantage but only have a certain amount of time before the train comes out of the tunnel.You feel for the ""good guys"" and there are some comedic moments to relieve the tension with a few one liners here and there.

189,80sHorror,"Bloody"" awesome! # 1 zombie movie , must see",10,5 February 2017,"The best zombie film I've seen in a long time. With its ultra fast piling over each other infected undead it is more in the style of World War Z than TV's The Walking Dead and also does not have the latter's extreme gore. There is enough blood and violence so it is not too light for a hardened zombie fan but focuses more on tension and action. It also managed to build up the characters so I cared about them and once that happens the tension stakes are that much higher. The main characters are a business man and his young daughter on a train when a zombie apocalypse begins. Death while infected causes people to instantly turn so one infected girl on the train causes the infection to spread like wildfire and very soon two groups of survivors remain, separated by infected carriages. Edge of the seat tension and many action set pieces follow as the smaller group tries to get to the front of the train and things escalate in all sorts of ways with some unexpected turns, big action, all building to a powerful climax. I loved it and was gripped from start to finish, I'm a big zombie fan and it did not disappoint. It's serious in tone and has some great character drama with some decent arcs and things play out in ways that have just a slight spin against Western expectations. The zombies are really well done, not too heavily made up (they're fresh) but they move well, all twitchy and sometimes freaky spasms, very fast and lethal. It is Korean language with subtitles but is not dialogue heavy.

You have fast-running zombies, blood spattering, and selfish people. The film delivers shock value, and decent drama along the way. It feels like World War Z without CGI zombies piling on each other. Being set on a train, the plot is also similar to Snowpiercer, another train horror movie. (what is this obsession with trains, or is it the only place in Korea where the space is cramped?)The acting is decent, and the casts are pretty average-looking; with the exception of the lead actor, which makes the story more credible.

192,BeanieCore,It truly is the best zombie film in years.,9,9 January 2021,"Back in 2016, this film took not just it's homeland, but the world by storm, becoming one of the most internationally successful horror films of all time. The fact that it was able to make the zombie sub-genre fresh again is a testament enough to what a great film it is, and it achieves this through focusing on the very aspect that more recent American zombie films neglect. And that is the humanity and emotional core of an apocalyptic event. The film's bread and butter are it's exceptional cast, and thoughtful writing. This isn't a collection of faceless victims lined up for the biting, instead you'll grow to genuinely care for and root for these people. Underlying the entire film is a message of selflessness, as the story confronts the life of a selfish businessman who must learn to put others before himself if he wants to save his only daughter. Through this, the film critiques the callousness and corruption of business culture and capitalism, without ever beating the audience over the head. Thankfully, it's just as good a horror film as it is a humanist drama. The infected borrow liberally from the ravenous, fast-paced flesh-eaters in ""World War Z"", but without that film's reliance on atrocious CGI. Thus the moments in which crowds of hyper zombies chase the cast through confined spaces are truly intense. And those more suspenseful moments are only made stronger by the well-written characters. It's a true masterclass in how to make an effective, classic zombie film. One that American directors should take notice of.

* the way they split the train into two factions that ended up turning against each other.
* the last scenes with the father dying, remembering his daughter being born and smiling, then cutting to the shadow of him falling off the train.
* the creative tension as the smaller group works their way to car 13. Each car is like a level, and each level has a different challenge. First it's just fighting, then it's fighting a car full of one of the character's classmates, then it's realizing they can't see in the dark and so follow sound, then climbing above the zombies. Each scene was tense.
* the fact that the survivors were only the little girl and pregnant woman. Two characters you figure would have the hardest time surviving.
* the daughter singing Aloha Oe at the end ""Farwell to Thee"" knowing she'll never see her father again.
* the daughter. Great acting, let alone for someone her age.
* nice tension throughout the movie.
* the train as a settingThere were a few things that didn't quite work for me:
* the grandma opening the door. Why?
* the crazy guy. Why didn't we get more from him? What's his story?
* the somewhat hard to believe scene of the high school student letting his friend-girl kill him. I don't believe they were a couple, so hard to believe he'd feel that deep. Then again, I'm long out of high school and have never been on a zombie train. Maybe I would have acted the same way.
* the infection timing seemed to be a bit convenient, happening quickly some times, and slow enough at other times for plot/dramatic convenience.Nevertheless, just a great movie once they board the train. Loved it!",Train to Busan

Years later, in the middle of 2016, the fantastic South Korean filmmakers decide to change that and give us an entertaining, brilliant and original zombie story.Filled with fantastic scenes, fast-paced action and fabulous performances, Train To Busan is a great zombie movie full of emotional moments and well-built suspense, set in what is a modern city and at the same time, the claustrophobic atmosphere of a train. The film is made to entertain, from beginning to end does not bore, finally a film of this type that is really worthwhile to pass the time.

198,heyimmyx,Immy's review : The best zombie movie,10,29 July 2020,"This is by far the best zombie movie ever made. The film is not only filled with fun zombie action, but also strong emotional turmoil, social commentary, character development, a look at our relationships with others, and the selfish nature of humankind. It was truly revolutionary in creating a zombie action movie with real depth and emotion. The movie gives a subtle but clever introduction to our main characters, most primarily Seok woo and his daughter Su An, who have a rocky relationship in part due to Seok's selfish nature and his inability to spend time with his daughter. Already this creates a intriguing relationship between Su An, who cares for others, and Seok, who says she must only look out for herself. This forms the basis of a strong development not only in Seok Woo's character, but also his bond with his daughter, who he soon finds out loved him much more than he previously thought, so you only fall more in love with their relationship. His character development was strong and well presented, practically showing him redeeming himself and distancing away from his selfish ways, progressing from anti hero to hero, all because of his daughter. I think this is what the made the movie stand out from other zombie movies. It purposely makes you form strong attachments to all of the main characters and their bonds with others, who, despite being at different stages of their lives and having different goals, are nonetheless loveable due to their apparent selflessness and their desires to protect the ones they love. This made the deaths much more heartbreaking. The acting was phenomenal from every actor, most notably from Gong Yoo and his daughter. It honestly baffles me how a child so young could act so well and demonstrate so much emotive pain, you would think she was genuinely a distraught child. The movie was extremely gripping and tense at times, with the just right amount of pacing, lighting and music to create a terrifying suspense throughout. The movie made the zombies genuinely horrifying, as demonstrated by their violent consumption of humans and most notably, their fast running...eeek. The ending made me weep like a baby, as we are left with a much better understanding of our main characters and the dire consequences of their selflessness. It was genius how emotional and isolating it all felt by the end, and the heartache you feel is immense. The movie does such a good job at gripping you and truly taking you through every event, emotion and turmoil, that by the end your heart and your head are exhausted. A true rollercoaster of a zombie film. Highly recommend!",Train to Busan

201,donb-519-335075,The best since Dawn of the Dead - remake,9,25 March 2017,"The first big budget zombie flick from South Korea. ""Train to Busan"" is terrific.Starting slowly like most zombie movies (something is wrong) it takes off and does not stop until (SPOILER ALERT) almost all the main characters have been dispatched. This is non stop action and excitement for almost the entire 2 hours. Just when the zombie genre is on life support (""The Walking Dead "" Season 7 is dying and killing all of us in the process), the Koreans have shown that there still is life in the genre.There are several new elements: (SPOILER ALERT II) most of the action takes place on a train; the heroes have to fight and trick their way to other survivors; the zombies are terrific - a lot of weird jerking around (reminiscent of the priest in the opening scenes of ""28 Days Later""); lots of zombies cascading through windows and falling over each other; an amazing train escape sequence you have to see; and numerous other very creative takes on the ""Zombie chasing humans"" device.But this is more than just wild zombie action. This is a story about self interest; caring for others; being willing to help; a father's redemption with his daughter, and the struggle between good and evil (naturally.)I have not enjoyed a zombie flick in many years - this one makes my all time top 10.If you are a fan of the genre, this one is a must see.

In a movie that had heart between the dad Seok-Woo and his daughter Su-an and their journey to Busan to go see his ex-wife and her mother for Su-an's birthday. On the train we get working-class man Sang-hwa and his pregnant wife Seong-kyeon. Sang-hwa was my favorite character in this movie and brought laughs and awesome action and strategy to a really scary movie. Yong-guk and his cheerleader girlfriend Jin-hee, elderly sisters In-gil and Jong-gil, and a homeless stowaway. All the actors and actresses were great and Seok-Woo went from unlikable loan lecher that only cares about himself into a really kind and awesome father.

The story focused on the father and daughter relation that we moved with through the story. The movie however couldn't make the story more solid where there are some scenes that played very important turns in the plot that was based on coincidence and Exaggerated action by the heroes that made the situation worse and worse but I have to say it most of the movie was very entertaining and made my on the edge of my seat and a lot more was sensible. The bad character I found it overrated and over performed. Gong Yoo Soo-an as The father and as the daughter did a great job in their roles and their relation was the warm part of the movie.

212,MovieWarfare,"Breaths life into a ""dying"" genre",9,5 September 2020,"Zombies have become so oversaturated in our culture. It has gotten to the point that zombies are just not scary anymore (thanks Walking Dead...). I just don't know if anyone could do anything new with this genre anymore until I watched ""Train to Busan"". The simple premise is that ""A divorced father Seok-woo, his estranged daughter and other passengers become trapped on a speeding train during a zombie outbreak in South Korea"".Let's talk what this movie does differently from previous zombie movies of the like. Firstly, the movie has the zombie stuff for the majority of the movie in an enclosed and cramped train. The claustrophobic nature of the train leads to some tense situations and even creative scenes that you wouldn't see in other zombie movies. For example, there is a scene where characters have to stealth by the infected in the dark and one where the characters have to punch there way from one cart to another. On that note, these action scenes are phenomenal. They are all thrilling to watch and always kept me on the edge of my seat. The zombies in this movie are very World War Z inspired but they are not just some mass of CGI. The zombies are phenomenal extras who manage to capture the essence of what a scary zombie should be through freaky body movements. Props should also be given for the makeup team as well because the zombies look as disgusting as one expects.Another element this movie does very well is the characters. Every main and supporting character stand out in different ways and each has vastly different personalities. The main character Seok-woo (Gong Yoo) is shown initially as a cynical workaholic who barely spends time with her daughter Su-an (Kim Su-an). Throughout the movie, he is selfishly just thinking about himself and his daughter but the character arc he goes through feels natural and believable. By the third act, you are rooting for him to succeed. The supporting characters in this movie are also great and each fully realized. My favourite has to be Sang-Hwa (Ma Dong-Seok) who is a tough and burly looking man who is trying to protect his pregnant wife. However, despite his demeanour, he is the one who puts himself at risk to help others, is the one who also provides the light-hearted comedy and is the one that pushes the development of the main character into a better person. He also has some of the best moments in the entire movie. Another stand out supporting character is Yon-suk (Kim Eui-Sung) a COO of some large business. He is absolutely the worst person in this movie as he is willing to sacrifice anyone just to survive and incite people to his cause. Major props to the actor for giving such a great performance in absolutely making me hate him. All the actors in this movie do a terrific job but I do have to give a mention to Kim Su-an who plays the daughter as child actors tend to be mostly a missed but Kim Su-an succeeds in the emotional moments and is a hit.While the story isn't something unique, the emotional moments and its social commentaries set it apart from something like World War Z. It's surprising but this movie explores a lot of the human nature of people. We see characters who want to do anything to survive, and others who will try to save others. The real main conflict that happens on the train is the clash between these two types of idealogy. We mostly watch our main character go from the survival idealogy to helping other mindset but the director also shows people who go from the opposite direction. There are also a lot of subtle commentaries sprinkled in this zombie movie tackling class warfare which is noticeable in the second viewing. The director also uses this to subvert expectations of characters like some who look shady or mean will be completely different. So this zombie movie is definitely not brainless"" and is another reason it's so different from others. Sang-Hwa says in the movie ""it's all about the sacrifices"" and this is where the emotional core of the movie lies in, the main lead having to do whatever to get his daughter to Busan. I won't spoil anything but this movie really hits hard and it won't be surprising if you tear up at times. On top of these praises, the score by Jang Young-gyu is really good as well. The composer makes some sharp sounds that really elevate the creepiness of the zombies or intense scores for the cool action sequences.If I had to give this movie a flaw then I have to say that some of the characters do make dumb decisions near the end. It just feels like it was senseless and silly which can take some people out of the movie. Additionally, the final act is very green screen green and has a lot of noticeable CGI which can be a little distracting.Overall, Train to Busan is one of the best zombie movies to come in the last decade or so. The movie breathes new life into a ""dying"" genre and also tackles unique themes on classes and moral polarization. This is a definite must-watch for everyone, especially those who love zombie movies.",Train to Busan

215,Mikelikesnotlikes,Great action filled movie,8,5 September 2017,"I can't possibly see enough Zombie movies before I die so I jumped into this one with few reservations even though it almost totally takes place on a train. The director did come through for me with excitement and gore aplenty .Asian action movies tend to be very direct and stereo-typical. There's usually a strong lead, a very evil character, pretty girls who require protection, and lots of cannon fodder bystanders.TRAIN TO BUSAN has all these hall-marks and, since I really love the Asian style, I really got into it.A few scenes were quite spectacular in the ferocity of the Zombie attacks. The carpet of zombies hanging off the back of the train was inspired. Also the scene where zombies were boiling through the carriage, covering every surface, was very effective.This is a great action movie. The only thing I hated was the subtitles.",Train to Busan
216,keikoyoshikawa,Surprisingly Good,8,26 October 2019,"This is what I imagine what it might have been like in South Korea during the early days of the zombie outbreak seen in ""World War Z.""The movie does a lot of things right, such as focusing on just a few main characters, keeping the story tight, and having a good mix of fast-paced action and down-times. Sure, its budget was super low compared to WWZ, but this did not in any way hamper the realism or the experience. If anything, I'm rather surprised by how well the movie was made with the money they had available.In fact, it seems relatively very little CGI was used, even for the zombies, which actually makes the movie that much more believable and realistic.With the exception of a few scenes, the acting was mostly superb. Many of the characters are completely believable, even in their frustratingly at times stupidity. The reality is that in times of crises, people behave differently, unexpectedly, and sometimes badly. But some also rise to the challenge. These behaviors are well represented in the movie.The only thing that I found to be difficult to believe is that there weren't more zombies running around in Busan, a city with nearly 4 million people.If you enjoyed WWZ, like I did, you'll definitely appreciate ""Busanhaeng.""",Train to Busan
217,Exiled_Universe,BEST EMOTIONAL ZOMBIE DISASTER ACTION FILM EVER MADE!!!!!!,8,14 June 2019,"Alright, so the only reason i didnt give this a 9 or 10 is because it needs a lot of action and violence for that but now for the review. This movie was clearly the best zombie disaster film ever made and the movie captures that and shows that very well. The only problem i have is that its not in English but in the end i dont really care and its not really about that. The ending is the real best part, it is very emotional and you are guaranteed to at least start to cry because i did. The zombie scenes in this movie are scary and super cool especially the first sighting of the zombies, omg you have to see this. This is like a whole new experience of scary. horror, and disaster. If this was rated r and had more gore and was in English then it would most likely be a 9 or a 10 but actually i think its better without it because it feels more sad and more realistic to the viewer. This movie is like a masterpiece in the end and there probably not another movie like this one. You have to see this movie. And the beginning was cool with the whole deer thing and that might be what cause the disease with something on the truck with the deer idk.

218,c-kelsall,Zombies on a train,7,31 August 2018,"First we had snakes on a plane, now Korean zombies on a train. Awesome.
Korean cinema is a curious beast; I love the films of Park Chan-Wook, but other contributors have a tendency to get a bit mawkish and oversentimental as the drama unfolds, and I'm afraid that what was otherwise a beautifully paced and entertaining ZOMBIE film ended up this way. I'm all for character development, and being made to care a bit who lives and who dies, but....IT'S A ZOMBIE FILM! It starts out tongue-in-cheek, with some genuinely squirmy horror vibes, and I think it would've been best if it managed that balance throughout, but it lost its way tonally a bit in the last 20 minutes.

222,baehr_adam,Snowpiercer Zombie Style!!!,10,8 November 2016,"OMG I just got out from watching what I believe to be the Greatest Zombie Film Ever Created. I will explain why I feel this way lol. I have seen a ton of Zombie films since ""Night of the Living Dead"" all the way to ""World War Z"" and in-between. My favorites up until this point were ""28 Days Later"" and the remake of ""Dawn of the Dead"" and being the horror movie buff that I'm I take pride in knowing I have seen a lot of movies. I will now start my review. The story is about a man who is taking his daughter to see her mom on a train when a virus breaks out all over South Korea. The premise is simple which makes the movie that much more agreeable. The acting was honestly great with the three main leads played by Yoo Gong who plays the father Seok Woo as well as the daughter played by Soo-an Kim and finally the heavy hitter Dong-seok Ma who has almost as much screen time as the father. The other actors did fantastic as well. The action is where this movie shines. I mean it was honestly as if ""28 days later"" and ""World War Z"" had a baby set in the Snowpiercer setting. The action was visceral and exhilarating. The zombie effects were top-notch and the blood was not too chaotic to the point of being unrealistic mind you this is a zombie film. The action was the Star in this film just to be clear with many scenes from ""Snowpiercer"" and ""World War Z"" being displayed here but what is used in better fashion in my opinion. The cinematography was Excellent and every scene both in the build-up scenes and the mayhem were shot with perfection. I didn't notice one hitch. The location they filmed in was Superb. I will close by saying that I may be biased and love Korean films ever since ""Oldboy"" released but please don't let you not liking to read subtitles be the reason that you miss such a monumental film in the zombie genre pass you by so to speak. The director Sang-ho Yeon deserves an Oscar for his directing of this Breathtaking Masterpiece. The film is also at times very emotional and heartbreaking but it has some of the slickest fight scenes in a zombie film to date.",Train to Busan
223,HorrorFanatic4Life,Action packed from beginning to end!,8,15 April 2020,"Although zombies typically had been slow in the past with them being the ""buried dead"", etc., you have to admit that zombies have evolved in movies so much since the '80s. What movie would be this intense with zombies that you could easily outwalk?! With that being said, these were pretty frightening and that's saying a lot considering there wasn't much gore to go along with it. The special effects weren't too over the top and there were plenty of pretty realistic bits to everything. In comparison I would say these zombies are similar to ones in World War Z or 28 Weeks Later.The difference between this movie and those other 2 is that this storyline is much better. There wasn't some special person on a special mission or anything extravagant. It was a normal dad and his daughter as well as other seemingly normal people going on a normal train ride that ends up being far from normal. Although no character was super special, it was still action packed and as realistic as you can get with zombie movies. To me that's what made it so amazing. Bonus points for actually killing off a main character since that usually never happens!There is also something to be said about the little girl. She was phenomenal for being so young and added so much to the movie. I didn't expect a movie like this to be so emotional, but she sure made it that way with several scenes. More notably when her dad got bit. That was a tough scene to watch because her emotions felt so real.All the other actors were great as well! I don't believe there was a single one that really sucked. Although there isn't much background with every secondary character, you still gather enough information about who they are as people as things progress. This helped with the very intense scenes where one would die off.I don't watch many Korean movies, or many other foreign films for that matter, but this has me wanting to watch more. The only difficult part was having to read subtitles and possibly missed some stuff by doing so, but there was so much other good to this movie that I didn't care in the end. Even for it being a pretty lengthy movie, which is usually a huge turnoff for me. Surprisingly I kept up from start to finish!An issue I noticed that was different than others was that there didn't seem to be a certain timeframe that one would turn rabid once they got bit. It seemed to vary depending on who got bit and where we were in the movie. It could be more intense that way considering you don't know when it will happen. Or it could be a bit of a plot whole. Just depends on how you look at it. There was also a little inconsistency with breaking glass being that sometimes they could break through and other times they couldn't although the glass is all the same.Another weird/confusing bit was when they went through tunnels and the zombies all of a sudden couldn't see. When that happened the zombies literally went mute pretty much and stopped attacking. But they could hear things still. The only problem I had with that is they made a point to say that they got angry when they saw the characters still alive. So do they get angry off seeing them? Or is it the noises the people make?? It seemed to be a little weird to have that part in there and didn't make much sense to me watching it play out.Besides those few negatives, this movie still had so much else to offer. I would still recommend to anyone that's into zombie-type moves. Really glad I stumbled upon it!",Train to Busan

Keep your massively overpriced Hollywood zombies that look like they belong in a movie and enjoy a true horde of undead that actually make you feel like there's no way to survive.Secondly, the movie has heart. It has believable characters that show the range of reactions you would find in real people. There's the self made heroes, the reluctant heroes, the people just trying to survive, the frightened mobs, and of course, the jackasses that will throw anyone they can under the bus (or zombie) in order to try and keep themselves safe. Add to that the truly emotional moments in the film. There are scenes that are simply emotionally painful to watch because of how well done and authentic they come across. None of that Hollywood cheese that tries to slap you in the face with a cardboard emotional scene and tells you to feel sad. This movie shows you how real people react and the actors make you feel like you're the one feeling the feels.For people who want a great zombie movie, this is one you can't miss. It also wins top points with those looking for great survival stories, or the drama of dealing with everything going wrong and trying to find some ray of hope. This should be the blueprint that all movies should use to know how to make a quality film.",Train to Busan
229,alexklatt-28518,Train to butt stain haha,2,23 April 2019,"This movie stinks. Here's the setup: a man works too much and has a daughter, and they're going to take a train to see the girl's mother. Got it? Good, time to get to the action.Zombies show up. The only kind of cool part of the whole movie is the creepy way zombies tend to come pouring out of windows and doors. That's seriously the highlight. People stand around like slack-jawed cattle waiting to be slaughtered. They watch people get eaten alive, with expressions on their faces that suggest they're instead looking at somebody being mildly rude at the dinner table. The undead monsters blessed with superhuman speed are able to kill rooms full of people seemingly within a minute or two. However, when they try to kill one of the main characters, they're about as dangerous as a chihuahua with teeth made of bubblegum. Doubly so if they go against the big cool guy, who can beat down train cars full of zombies without breaking a sweat. Anybody bitten by a zombie turns into a bloodsucking monster within 10-30 seconds, unless they're a main character or antagonist, in which case it takes forever so that it's DRAMATIC.This movie has the good old fashioned 'let those people die, because maybe they're infected' cliche. Except it doesnt make ANY SENSE because like I just said, people TURN WITHIN 30 SECONDS.One by one the protagonists sacrifice themselves heroically, and the bad guy tries to kill them for actually, literally no reason. Also the zombies can't see in moderately dim lighting conditions, and they can't catch up to a lady who is about 7-8 months pregnant.At the end, the little girl and the pregnant woman are the only ones alive. They're about to get sniped for no good reason, until the girl sings the song she wanted to sing for her dad I guess. Everybody's heart strings get horribly tugged. Or if they're like me, they thank god that it's over. Frustrating, inconsistent, illogical, cliche, completely lacking in tension. It's bad.",Train to Busan

I'd heard people speaking highly of it and finally got around to giving it a watch, and wow, I was NOT disappointed. Train To Busan takes the zombie genre to a whole new level!Instead of being your average, cheesy style zombie flick, it focuses on raw human emotion and paints a beautiful and almost poetic picture of just how heart breaking it would be to have to endure the horrifying experience of a zombie apocalypse.I enjoyed the uniquity of the story, the film is very well shot and acted, the zombies were well portrayed, the action sequences were well choreographed, it's honestly really hard to find something I didn't like about it, which is why it's a 10 from me! An absolute must watch for any fan of the genre!",Train to Busan

234,chilligrrl,Glad i watched this AFTER i went to Korea.,8,26 October 2019,"I put this off deliberately as i just went on a trip to Korea 3 weeks ago and took the train to Busan from Seoul. I wouldn't have put one foot on a train if i'd watched it first, and would have been on the lookout for zombies the whole time. Kudos to KORAIL for putting their name all over this movie though, my local railway sure wouldn't.It was interesting, horrifying, corny, brilliant.... everything all squished into one train. I feel for the little girl though, and her father when he finally did what he did at the movie end. Watch this, but not just before you vacation in Korea, seriously.",Train to Busan
235,lynansaysingle,Cassandra Crossing x Snakes on the Plane,9,2 August 2021,"What a great ride this movie was! I don't watch Foreign movies because I don't like reading subtitles but this one I made an exemption. I'm a Zombie movie fan and I kept hearing about Train to Busan. Last night I finally watched it and it did not disappoint. It is definitely action packed, intense, and emotional in the end. It did bring tears to my eyes to watch the little girl cry realizing the fate of his father. I really enjoyed the fast pace of this movie like you don't have time to catch your breath once the action starts. I also like the character development although It would have been good to know more about the reason behind the outbreak besides saying a leak in the chemical plant.A well fitted ending which I appreciate, I wasn't sure where the movie was going to end. The girl singing that song for his father was also a nice touch. The movie was so good the 2 hours just went by and I wanted the movie to keep going. This movie is better than a lot of the American Zombie movies around. Easy in my top ten in zombie genre.",Train to Busan
236,UnderworldRocks,Not scary or gory. Tedious and boring. The ending sucks.,1,10 January 2017,"Some of the characters' behaviours in the movie are laughable. For example, the first time the passengers got out of the train only to find the station infested with zombies. What was their reaction? Run back and open the door to a car already full of zombies! Smart move, people!For another example, a bunch of survivors in car #15 refused to open the door for another group of survivors, because some guy feared the other group might be infected. Actually, one easy solution would be for survivors in car #15 to move to another car, for instance, car #16 and let those people have #15. Car #15 was not the only safe place. But... They were too dumb to make room, those idiots.The beggar character's heroic move at the climax makes no sense. He had always been portrayed as cowardly. Therefore, the sudden 180 degrees change is not convincing at all.Let's not forget the laughable ending. The little girl suddenly felt like singing after the disaster? Yeah, very interesting. It would have been so much better if the soldiers had killed both the pregnant woman and the girl. That kind of dark ending would have made an impact. The current one in the movie is ridiculous.The plot was predictable. You could always guess who was going to die next. The movie is not even scary, and the amount of gore is atrociously little.I guess the only good thing is the opening scene where a deer became a zombie deer. That was interesting enough.",Train to Busan
237,hikerhetav,Train to Busan is ready to board your thrilling veins,7,25 October 2016,"Another film on zombies. Another gripping story to haunt you out of your pacific zones. Let's see if it takes your heart out of you to thrill you the most. Well, I've seen two or may be three films on zombies and I was never so attached to any of them like I was with Train to Busan. Story itself is so captivating that it'll leave you faint hearted. I guess I never liked any zombie film that much from my heart before that much I do like this one. The difference is, other films had lack on emotional constraints and other symptoms of zombie theory. Well TTB doesn't lack this and it is so challenging to other zombie outlets that you'll feel grabbing your seats very tight until the very end scene of the film. Sang Ho Yeon has worked very captivating and his frames are too perfect to make you wait for the climax. Even after few zombie movies from Hollywood, this one doesn't let down expectations of zombie fans. Coming to the movie, acting of protagonists is demanding and excellent. They have been shown fearful and they deliver top notch emotions. Yoo Gong, Dong-seok Ma, Woo- sik Choi are amazing to see fight zombies and they ain't making any mistakes in fear or hurrying in emotions. That's the major thing to see in this movie. About zombies, they are obviously harrowing and classically employing their duties aptly. Spreading of zombies is shown too nearly that you can't imagine which zombie is dangerously killing or who's not. If you want to try some powerful package of entertainment go grab your tickets and enjoy your show.",Train to Busan

It's not about zombies, but humanity. People that are old enough to think should relate to the drama part easily and the message it's passing.The final 15 minutes was really emotional, and I didn't expect it to be so pronounced because I already got the ""message"" throughout the entire film before the last bite started. The movie would still be good even without the last part, and probably more balanced emotionally.",Train to Busan

241,jerralagbayani,Scary fun!,6,13 January 2018,"This movie was literally a Korean Version of World War Z because of it's action. Unlike going across the world to find a origin of the virus this is more of surviving on a train with a bunch of characters that you can actually remember unlike some movies where they introduce the character but don't go as much in-depth. I also liked how they somewhat had a basis on what happened.
What I didn't like were the first 15 minutes. When the man ran over the deer and the deer got reanimated I never understood it's purpose rather than the zombies are rising. I never understood much also of the main character's business and work, maybe if they added 5 minutes somewhere in the beginning of him talking more to his Mother it would've added more sentimental value.",Train to Busan

It is a well rounded movie and the acting performances are above par. This I say when comparing it to movies belonging to the same genre. There is nothing here that hasn't been done before but the way it has been shot is commendable. The ride starts early and the tension does not let up for a single moment. Especially heart rending is the scene towards the end where the father sacrifices himself to save his daughter. It is the sort of movie that stays with you long after the credits role because you start to think - what would you do when you face such insurmountable odds. Again, not something that is unique to this movie but the way it has been done is unique and appealing. Altogether an excellent movie. Now let's wait for Hollywood to butcher it with a remake.",Train to Busan

An infected passenger does the rest... Watching this movie, I couldn't help but draw visual comparisons to the type of infection seen in World War Z. There are indeed comparable stories in both movies, in the extended version of WWZ there is a strong Korean storyline suggesting that the infection could have originated somewhere in Korea. In TTB, the characters take centre stage and the apocalypse storyline has been compressed into this moving train. The characters are a clear representation of the best and worst of humanity and it's interesting to see them interact with their situations. It's almost like watching a case study on a zombie apocalypse... I wasn't a fan of the fate of some of the characters and the last minute death of the father seemed pointless but maybe my strong reaction was the intended reaction? Either way it's another cool Korean picture.",Train to Busan

Tension runs high however with every possible situation of a runaway train with zombies on board terrorizing the passengers before these in turn change into zombies exploited and milked dry
There are the usual tropes thrown in; the capitalist rich man who stops at nothing to save his life, the innocent and vulnerable child (who likes to stare a lot), the equally vulnerable pregnant wife (I never saw a pregnant woman run so fast in a movie), the dad who tries to save his child and the selfless hero among the top cast. Of these Dong-seok Ma who plays the altruistic hero is the most accomplished of all, acting wise",Train to Busan
251,cjs6547,An entertaining instance in an otherwise dead genre,8,22 December 2016,"I am not a fan of Zombie movies, like some of the other reviewers on here, which says a lot about the entertainment and production value of Train to Busan when I can safely say I thoroughly enjoyed it.It's nice to see Zombies away from that post-apocalyptic urban setting where most of them would be in dark alleyways or lurking in abandoned apartments. Here we are in a train with a bunch of likable and memorable characters as the zombie outbreak happens, and there's little suspense but plenty of quick action in each scene. This is again an accomplishment since quick sequences of action one after the other is harder to get right without leaving mistakes for the audience to point out.That doesn't mean this movie doesn't resort to many zombie tropes, in the sort of way that makes you think it is consciously doing so. But that's all fun and good. The fast, bone cracking zombie acrobats are also captivating.For me, it's biggest accomplishment would be to put so much emotion and meaning in the death of one character at a point in the film when most of the audience would be desensitized to death. Yes, this movie was the first in a LONG time to make me tear up. So, whether you like Zombie movies or not, give Train to Busan a try. It may not be entirely logical, but its good fun and easy on the eyes.",Train to Busan
252,yourfavoritecritic,"Zombies, Trains and Automobiles",6,2 July 2021,"Train to Busan is written and directed by Sang-ho Yeon and stars Gong Yoo, Su-an Kim, Yu-mi Jung and Ma Dong-seok, among others. Train to Busan was released back in 2016 and became one of the most successfully South Korean films ever made, the film tells the story of the early stages of a zombie apocalypse, centring on a divorcee returning his daughter to his estranged wife from Seoul to Busan.I had little-to-no expectations going into Train to Busan, outside of a couple of recommendations from friends who were fans of the film and after seeing it I was pleased enough with the final results. The zombie subgenera of horror has been one that has fallen out of favour with me for years now; it's not that I don't respect the classics (like George A. Romero's original 'dead' films) and I haven't enjoyed the genre in the past, it's just something that I have lost interest with. With that being said, Train to Busan is an entertaining film even if I wasn't head over heels for it.I'll first start with the acting which I found to be great, although I don't understand Korean so I'm unsure how well lines were delivered, the performances still felt captivating. Eui-sung Kim who played the film's central antagonist was a character that I haven't disliked as much as him in a very long time - in the best way possible. He oozed an intensity that made it hard to take my eyes off of whenever he was on screen, the character's selfishness and ignorance towards the ongoing situation was equally frustrating to watch as it was engaging and it made me anticipate the character's fate. Similarly, to the performance of Yon-Suk, Gong Yoo and Su-an Kim who played father-daughter were also fantastic and helped to carry the film along, even when the story slowed to a halt. The pinnacle of their performances comes near the end during an emotional finale that really highlights both actor and actress. Lastly, Ma Dong-seok was also great and his character served as a useful foil to to Yoo's Seok-woo, that helped to bring some development to the Seok-woo, even if the story only takes place over a few hours.Speaking of the story, it is mostly good however has some faults that cannot be overlooked. The setup to this movie is great and the initial outbreak scene on the train is thrilling, along with other segments throughout the film that I'm sure will keep you on the edge of your seat. My problems with the story arise with the film's rules as far as the time takes for the change to occur in the undead, as there are a couple of instances where the story seems to stretch its own rules to the limit, creating for times where I was taken out of the film. Furthermore, my final gripe actually comes from the pacing of the film, clocking in at just under two hours Train to Busan is a film that feels like it can drag in places, aiding in an experience where one might feel the runtime. There are moments throughout the movie where scenes could have been edited down or cut altogether, most notably around the second act.All in all, Train to Busan is a decent zombie flick that I can recommend if you are interested, as mentioned from the top I am not the biggest fan of the zombie subgenera so I can't speak on what this film does differently to shake things up and if you are a connoisseur of undead flicks take what I say with a grain of salt. Train to Busan is a film filled with suspenseful moments, which are aided by great performances however falls short in the story department and overall editing. Although the first act does a good job setting the stage for what's to come and the third act being an emotional conclusion to the tale, Train to Busan still left me wanting more and for that reason I am giving this film a 6/10.",Train to Busan

I wish I could write something about the ending without spoiling it for those that are reading this. But what a ending. A ending I did not expect. What a beautiful movie though. A movie that had drama, love, horror, thrill, comedy and everything else in it. A mix of everything. I will add this on my list of the best movies I have ever seen.

I've never watched a Korean movie before but I love films of the horror/thriller genre. Nothing much surprises me these days as I've seen it all before but still usually enjoy them. So I saw this was highly rated and gave it a go. I was locked in from the start. The characters were very engaging and they hook you in their journey. What really stood out for me was the fact this zombie film made me emotional. Horror films don't make me emotional but this made me cry. I am truly amazed as I never expected a Korean film to be such quality. The acting, scenery and special effects were on par of a A grade Hollywood film. The scenes throughout were totally heartbreaking specially at the end. Thank you for not killing them right at the end. My only criticism would be that the three of them should have made it till the end, I am a sucker for happy endings. I loved the character of the pregnant lady's husband, he was awesome and I was gutted he didn't make it. Most Hollywood dramas take seasons to character develop but this film managed it right from the start. Highly recommend it.",Train to Busan
256,lukas-ingel,Mostly very good,7,20 April 2020,"Yeah so if you watch this movie, I think it's hard to deny how good it is. The action, production, acting combined with both horrifying elements and heartwarming and heartbreaking character moments throughout, it's quite the ride (pun intended).
I really thought I was gonna like this movie a whole lot more up until the ending. Spoilers*! of course.
There were a few pacing issues going back and forth between this big character moment and this big character moment and this big character moment, which honestly made me feel like watching a few insanely good episodes of The Walking Dead back-to-back (not to really compare the two in any other way as they are entirely different). So when it came to the ending, it didn't quite stick the landing for me. At that point, I was very emotionally invested with the characters and it felt kind of like cheating how they killed off the main hero like that and give him his moment and it just...The acting was insane (deserves way more credit than it even gets, especially the little girl), but I honestly had trouble feeling it as much. You just keep seeing this thing throughout the movie and the pay-off for the death is so minimal and such a cowardly low character to bring this faith to the story. (And I do appreciate what they were trying to say but I think the point came across more than once both about status and simply about being humane.) It honestly only upset me that it was what happened, and when we see a very iconic shot of the two remaining survivors at the end walking together, I couldn't help but feel like they definitely earned that moment but so did the dad, and I just didn't feel it as much cus my emotions had just gotten zoomed out. It's like hey, the team behind this movie wanted to do everything to make you cry and even put in shots of the girl as a baby, which could be fine, but it just wasn't quite earned and it pretty much messes up the satisfaction of that ending. Not that we need happy endings or even a bittersweet one but dang... Earn it, don't draw it out and suddenly kill off the hero like 15 other people with these moments because suddenly he can't throw this dumb person off a train in eight attempts despite what we just been seeing for 2 hours, resulting in a cut scene from Grey's Anatomy mixing newborns with melodramatic death scenes.
Unfortunately, that just leaves me having not gained quite the impact I expected from the first and second act and not even half as satisfied as I were with them, bringing me to that I'll still call this a mostly very good movie... overall.(I certainly hope there is not going to be an American remake of this ever, that'd be too bad. But with its great universal sale, upcoming sequel and high quality production matching some of the best we get from Hollywood, I hope and suspect that it won't be the case. This stands perfectly in its own roots.)",Train to Busan

258,varnium,Better than Hollywood Zombies,10,9 November 2017,"Although it is made in Korea, the essence of the story is far more meaningful and emotional than those of a Hollywood zombie movie. The drama is very touching. I've never felt so sad watching a zombie movie before. The entire scene from start to finish really consume you. Just like those Divergent trilogy. Even though it's a 2 hour movie, you just can't get enough of it and wanting for more. Like it should be a 3 hour movie. It really hooks your attention to it.The characters are convincing.

259,Parks,Action-Packed Zombies - Heavy-Handed Storyline,6,4 February 2017,"There are good and bad things about ""Train to Busan"". It's a claustrophobic zombie movie that makes the most of having its protagonists trapped on a speeding train with a horde of ravenous zombies.It doesn't milk that situation of being trapped quite as effectively as ""REC"" but the action sequences are spectacular and the zombie attacks are very well-staged.Other reviewers have praised the social satire element of the film. Hmm... I found it might have worked better if it were not laid on with a trowel. The ""douche"" fund-manager, the evil executive who just NEVER MISSES an opportunity to screw someone over. I found it painfully sentimental at times and ""Yes, I get it"" obvious at others.At this moment in history, when the rich and powerful are turning us against each other in order to further their own interests we do need films with messages like this. And on the whole I enjoyed ""Train to Busan"" more than I didn't. But if there is to be remake, I do hope the film-makers allow for a little more subtlety in there.",Train to Busan

Imagine being inside a fast train with zombies trying to tear you apart in most of the wagons. The cast do a great job in this movie. Especially the little girl Suan is acting her heart out and the charismatic Sang-Hwa more than once saves the day. All people you would normally meet on the train are present and once again we discover that the real horror can lie with the people, not with the monsters. Monsters have one thing on their mind: to eat you. People make decisions that effect other people and can spread the hate under the majority just because they only think of their own survival. It is a lesson in survival, and the big question is how do you want to survive. Being a selfish prick using a human shield or protect others even if it might kill you. It was very well done, I enjoyed the movie immensely, the pace of the story is good, as is the script, most of the main characters have multiple layers and there is a good amount of drama next to the horror and gushing blood.

It's plot is weak and has tons of holes, acting was weak, direction was focused more on the aesthetics of the shots rather than story telling. It's comparable to Resident Evil series... actually, I think Resident Evil series is much better.The main character is supposed to be changing from selfish in the beginning to caring for others towards the end. But the main actor played the ""good guy"" from the beginning and the contrast wasn't apparent. He destroyed what could've been a great character to play.Overall, this was one of the worst of 2016.

Those are stereotypical .. but not dull. There is character developement .. believable .. as well as sacrifice and heroism. All is done in a very ""natural"" .. not forced way. There are manierisms that feel a bit foreign to western culture, i guess .. but nothing that is in the way of understanding the plot. I would guess that an asian viewer might pick up on things a western viewer might not .. but those would only be subtle. Action is well done with a few CGI effects (regarding the horde) that do look rather odd. Most effects seem to be practical though and the acting is mostly well done (despite the occasional overacting and the obviously overacted ""bad guy"")Since it is a very classic zombie story, there are the typical weaknesses of course .. but all in all .. the movie is engaging and very enjoyable to watch .. although not a suspeseful as other horror movies (it was more an action flick in my opinion that just happened to have zombies in it)",Train to Busan

But I was drawn by the stars being quite generous and thought I'd give it the usual five minutes chance and I'm glad I did. It was very different in style and feel from the get-go - not your usual grainy, poorly edited rubbish. The movie kept me gripped from start to finish and I hate Zombie movies! Here's the other amazing thing... I had no subtitles and yet I watched it in full! It takes some movie to do that. Yes the plot-line wasn't exactly challenging, but even so. It just had me hooked. The acting was excellent, particularly, the minuscule actress, Kim Su-An, who steals the entire movie, particularly the last few minutes - an award-winning performance. Yes, the ending is a little overly emotional, but I guess that's how it is with some foreign movies. People who are saying detrimental things about this movie are simply not remembering movies like: World War Z (the plot line of which is so fantastical it beggars belief). The simple fact is that this is the best zombie movie I've ever seen. It's well worth seeing (with subtitles).

So one chomp and evidently the zombies aren't hungry for you any more as you are one of them. Makes you wonder what all the fuss is about since all you seem to have to do is tape their mouths shut or stuff a sock into it.Virus outbreak zombie movies seem to fall into 2 camps, those with slow moving zombies and those with olympic sprinters. These are the latter. Despite epic levels of speed, they are blind in the ""just dark enough"" passages. Again, makes you think all you have to do is wait for dark, I mean dusk, and duct tape them all, threat neutralized.I was willing to look over all of these shortcomings because you do find yourself caring about most of the characters presented. But then came the last 20 minutes where it was just so overdone and stupid that I had to write a review saying so. The ending is overly dramatic and totally predictable and immensely underwhelming. It really makes the previous time spent watching the film feel as totally wasted.

It's very fast, action, horror movie but with a great cast, and involving characters you can relate to and like a lot. It has very emotional moments, very well done, not overdone to the point of unrealistic or pathetic, but very well balanced. Action scenes are amazing, you can help but to root for most characters (not all, there are few characters you want to see dead, but even they are not just evil machines, they show some humanity here and there), zombies are quite frightening, not slow and fragile as we used to see but fast, agile and very dangerous.

Characters' actions mostly remained convincing: their behaviour is driven by consistent, reasonable motive, and some characters transformed through meaningful incidents naturally, not in a sudden to fit the ending. Each survivor is well acted.Camera work was effective in portraying a sense of dread and chaos, while keeping focus on the main characters and plots moving along the train corridors. At 2 hours in length, there wasn't much dragging scenes at all. I just skipped the character intro (10 minutes), and from then on, the story runs along. How realistic is the ending depends on the viewer: are you an optomist or a pessimist? Either way, it's 2 hours well spent.The 15 minute behind the scenes bonus feature actors and production crew rehearsing, teasing each other, including bloopers, quite a strange shift in mood :)",Train to Busan

284,natsuka_arei,Dropped. Can't watch it until the end,3,23 April 2020,"I hate to say this because I have positive expectation towards this movie since several of my friends recommended it and told me this was good. Yet, here I am writing a bad review about this. One of the reason why I want to drop this without even finishing it, is because there are so many inconsistencies throughout the movie not to mention all the characters in it did unbelievable, unrealistic stupid act during what we called as emergency situations in which your very own life is on the line. Ex. of this stupidity:1. The first infected person who was sneaking into the train still got consciousness and only turn into zombie after some time but this rule doesn't apply to the rest of the movie because immediately after that the infection spread at amazing speed. It only needs seconds fort the bitten to turn into zombie.Then right before the end of the movie (I read all the bad review before hand and decided to jump several times to see whether it is worth it or not to spend my 2 hrs for this movie), the infected person once again slowly turn into zombie (esp.when the main character involved, suddenly the infected person still had a little of consciousness for a while until completely turn into the mindless one)
2. Way of fighting. I already watched several types of zombie movies (Dawn of the dead, World War Z, Warm Bodies, Zombieland,28 Days Later, RE, I am Legend > which is my favourite so far)and the way MC fight back (or the rest of the victim ways of responding the outbreak) kinds of silly, lame, uncool, and can't bring the tension.Without regret, I dropped this one. Not even ""the supposed to be heart warming scene"" where the little girl had to depart from the MC can change my mind to continue it. FYI, I'm a big fans of Korean Drama, Korean movies, and actually watch Gong Yoo drama series, but his act in this movie just so-so especially in the last scene of him (I cringe a lot, C'mon!There are so many better ways to fight the last zombie villain yet you choose to do something that will obviously be your death flag. Seriously. The story writer got mess up in the head and didn't working on the story properly), and I can't bear to watch this anymore.Save yourself by skipping this one. Feel free to try if you are rather a curious mind like I did (I give it a shot despite many bad review since I believe sometimes review can be pretty much subjective) but beware you have been warned.",Train to Busan

The aerial scenes were very well shot. The cinematography is spectacular n the editing crispy. The film is loaded with tension n mayhem throughout. The best character is the husband of the pregnant woman. One helluva selfless fella.This is the best zombie film I've seen.

They have been overdone to the point of exhaustion but Train to Busan manages make zombies interesting again. The choice to keep the characters and zombies limited to a small space creates lots of tension which many zombie movies misses out on by having a large environment.

Set on a high speed train traveling through South Korea on just another day, the passengers are trapped inside a fast paced metal coffin of death, along with victims from a virus outbreak. It doesn't take long until the the situation is out of control and people are forced to defend themselves against certain death any way they can. The film is a road-map into the emotions of humans in a crisis. Ans we get to watch in horror as fear and panic claims just as many lives as the infected. We follow a random selection of passengers, but we closely follow the divorced father who has brought his young daughter on the train to visit her mother on her birthday. That movement from train-car to train-car could be a step towards safety just as death, and all the traits that make up who you are could be what saves you or lead to your demise.Amazing performances from the entire cast. Especially from young Soo-an Kim. Cinematography is great and some scenes are nothing short of astonishing. A film that constantly have your heart pounding and doesn't leave you unmoved. A must see for the horror fan.",Train to Busan
289,nmn34,"Hard to Think What to Title This, Its a Zombie Movie",8,14 April 2017,"Zombie movies are very samey,there is no denying this. There is rarely anything that strays from the zombie formula, rarely do you see anything but the immediate start of the outbreak or the recent aftermath. Train to Busan doesn't break from this tradition and doesn't bring anything new to the genre but what it does it does very well.The setting is perfect for a zombie outbreak, a confined space where there is nowhere to run but still provides better security than being outside. It makes the initial slaughter more plausible, the people that are immediately infected aren't just gawking as the first person is attacked, they're actually trapped and picked off in a domino effect. As they try to flee down the cramped isle, they are picked off by a constantly growing number of zombies until they could reach the relative safety of the next car only for it to fall to a similar fate. Its only when the front of the line manage to put some distance between them that they are able to secure themselves in the first class car. Since the train is almost constantly moving, they are safe from the zombies outside as it searches for safe haven but they can't just get rid of the zombies they have since they control the coupling. And when a small band of survivors are trapped in the rear, the train becomes an convincing gauntlet Te zombies themselves aren't much to look at, they are the usual bullet to the head zombies alas the Of The Dead series and there isn't much to differentiate them from normal people other than glassy eyes and possibly the injury that converted them so cosmetically they aren't the most interesting to look at. The outbreak was too recent to for them to undergo any purification so their makeup is minimal. In motion however they have a lot more going for them. They are quick when motivated and chase their prey with single minded determination but when left alone they meander about like they were in the Thriller video. It is kind of hokey but its seeing them get up more than makes up for it. Rather than just climbing to their feet they contort and twist their bodies until they're on their feat. The process is unnatural and unnerving to watch and is really all there is to set it apart from most zombie movies.Characters are done well but are pretty much what one would expect from the genre. Just about everyone fits into an archetypal role, the cowardly antagonist, the caring father, the too good daughter, the plucky young man and his girl, and the like. Everyone fits into two terms I could borrow from wrestling, the baby faces and the heels, and they fit them well. The faces are likable, even when they do have their faults they are genuinely good people and learn from them. You route for them and mourn when they fall short. The heels are detestable, they wallow in their inadequacy and are genuinely hate-able people that you feel glad when they receive their comeuppance. It is generally the response you would want from the audience, there aren't mixed messages that the hero is secretly a terrible person. And they drive one of the main themes of the movie home well, the sacrifice of the father for the good of the family.The downside, it falls for the same trappings as most zombie movies. I mentioned the gauntlet earlier, it is a great idea but with some thought it seems completely unnecessary. The small party were in a safe-ish part of the train, with a little work they should have been able to secure it better and just hunkered down. They could have even contacted the main party and given them updates on their situation, running the gauntlet only puts themselves at greater risk, had they just remained there almost all of the later deaths could have been avoided. But alas, it is a zombie movie and careful strategics has no place when suicidal pro-activity is an option.",Train to Busan

I was jumping all over and crying and laughing. I even wanted to shout at some of the characters.The characters have the most realistic reactions when they were faced in a life or death situation. And yes even if you don't think about it some people will react to that kind of extreme. They weren't like most characters in a zombie movie. Where it's all camaraderie.

293,philipposathina,a horror film and a drama in one package,10,22 November 2018,"Actually a very good one in both categories. Korean cinema has given some very good movies in the past -starting from the excellent ""old boy""- and has already been recognised as an asset in movie industry, so it would be rather foolish to undervalue its films as coming from a country far too remote, far too culturally different, far too unknown to pay some attention to its productions.
I started watching this film with no prejudice but also not been sure of the quality of what i was to watch. Right from the begining it was apparent that it was a serious production and not at all a cheap cartoon style film from a ""third"" country. And so it proved to be till its very end: A very well made zombie/horror film and not at all only. Through the story line and using the zombie issue as an excuse and cause, there was a very clear and interesting effort to point out the contrast of ""good"" and ""evil"" in human nature, and that is among living humans themselves. You add to this the really tender family drama unfolding along a very well and quite realistically made adventure and you have a film which captures your attention from the very beginning and finally leaves you very moved and in tears.
Last but not least: The excellent acting -the little girl will break your heart especially in the final scene- and the amazing, musically simple yet really imposing, epic music score in the ending credits.

I'm not a great fan of zombie movies, I don't watch Walking Dead, but this film impressed me enormously because the zombies are, first, only incidental to the plot; and secondly, they have allowed the director to incorporate some truly wonderful and bizarre concepts. The film starts in a subtle sort of way. Watch carefully or you'll miss things. It's nice to see how the director uses these half- glimpsed horrors to show the dawning comprehension of the passengers on the train, that something seems to be going wrong with the world. The director Sang-ho Yeon, who also wrote the screenplay, is adept at stretching out the agony to improbable levels as time after time the zombies almost get to chow down on the passengers. But as I said earlier, this is a long film, and there's only a certain amount of time before chowing down does indeed occur, and a whole lot more, besides. The high point of the film, for me, comes when the train nearly crashes headlong into a disaster scene at an intermediate station. Somehow the passengers and driver must find another train to continue their journey to Busan, and - they hope - safety. And now begin screaming again. I'm giving this film 10 points because of so many things, but mainly the sheer inventiveness of Sang-ho Yeon.",Train to Busan

Train to Busan, however, restores my faith in the sub-genre as director Yeon Sang-ho does not treat his characters as mere cannon fodder. Each character arc is well-contemplated, the established relationships may not be equally potent with each other, but for a film to wrestle with so many of them while successfully maintaining the edge-of-the-seat tension, the result is quite brilliant.We can see positive character growth in the main protagonist, Seok- wu (Gong Yoo), a divorced, workaholic fund manager/""corporate bloodsucker"" who consistently neglects his daughter Su-an (Kim Su-an). We get to know that he's not exactly father-of-the-year material, he buys his kid a Nintendo Wii for her birthday oblivious to the fact that he already one to her earlier the same year. He reprimands her daughter's misplaced kindness during the zombie invasion, ""In times like this, you have to think for yourself first."" Few scenes later, the girl says to him, ""You only think about yourself. That's why mommy left."" Boy, he just got ""re-educated"" This kid is going to be her dad's moral compass throughout their eventful ride to Busan.Busan also includes a group of archetypal commuters to make this horrendous experience relatable to a wider audience: a pregnant woman (Jung Yu-mi) who's heavily relying on her brawny husband (Ma Dong-Seok), a pair of elderly sisters (Ye Soo-jung and Park Myung- sin), a pair of high-school sweethearts (Choi Woo-sik and Ahn So-hee) and a stern-looking businessman (Kim Eui-sung). The last person to hop in, however, is a girl with a strange bite on her thigh. We know where this heads now but the train crew seems to be more alarmed at the presence of a homeless man (Choi Gwi-hwa) hiding inside the washroom. Alas, once the infected girl rips the throat of her first victim and the zombies start to chomp and multiply (Hold the door! Hold the door! Hodor!!!), the film starts to categorize its characters: the selfless and the self- serving. These zombies may be the film's antagonist but there is a much more unsettling beast at the face of damnation: society quickly adepts to a new set of morals. Earning his spot as one of the most hated cowards in history, Eui-Sung's businessman character is the epitome of greed in this film. As he literally flings his fellow survivors to the undead for the sake of self-preservation, the point is clearly made that this is a dog-eat-dog world, whether it is the apocalypse or not.Whereas its obvious competitor World War Z shows a city-wide scale of apocalypse, Busan proves that confining it to a smaller scale is not a hindrance to deliver well-choreographed and jolt- inducing action sequences. Needless to say, my favorite part of this film is when the three male characters start to navigate their way through the carriages, each station proving to be more difficult than the last one. It certainly helps to know that these morphine-driven, break- dancing zombies have a flaw to them: they can only see or hear but they can't smell and they're also not taught how to open doors. Once those rules are established, director Sang-Ho levels the playing field by turning tunnel drives into game cheats, washrooms into sanctuaries and luggage compartments into unlikely safe passages.Train to Busan may not reinvent the zombie sub-genre per se but director Yeon Sang-Ho has a clever use of technique for this film to work both as a grisly form of entertainment and as a potent social allegory as well. For that, he solidifies his spot as a go-to- director when it comes to zombie films. The buzz for this film is totally worth it.",Train to Busan
304,ShanTeaTime,Not Your Average Gore-Fest Zombie Flick,8,13 January 2020,"""Train to Busan"" is a 2016 Korean drama/zombie film directed by Yeon Sang-ho. It follows a man named Gong Yoo, his estranged daughter Soo-Ann and other passengers become trapped on a speeding train during a zombie outbreak in South Korea.I was recommended to watch this film by a close friend of mine, he knows I love horror/drama films and the fact that it's a Korean based film is even more up my alley. Then I found out this was on Netflix, so I finally got to watch it! I can honestly say this is the strongest zombie film I've ever seen, I know that's a huge statement to make since some U.S. based zombie films are well regarded. However I have my reasons, which I will get into.First of all whatever cameras they used to film this movie I would kill to play around with! This movie was beautiful and so crystal clear in picture. There are fantastic shots done in this film and I really appreciate it for that. Also the special effects themselves were top of the line, that deer at the beginning looked fantastic. Seeing hoards of zombies running and falling over each other like a tidal wave was horrifying, there is so much great tension in this film. Also, the actors they got to play the zombies were fantastic in the way they moved and contorted. The movie also didn't need to use disgusting visuals to get it's point across, which zombie films/series do quite often.Every character had personality. I don't personally know any of the actors in this film, but they made a lasting impact on me! Everyone was great, but the 2 that stood out the most to me were the dad (Seok-woo) played by Yoo Gong and Yong-guk played by Woo-sik Choi. Both played emotion with such expression and guttural tones that I felt their performances were the most noteworthy. Also... Woo-sik Choi is very cute, so I'll be checking him out in ""Parasite"" as well.When character die throughout this movie, you feel the loss. Which is the greatest compliment you can give a film like this. The action and drama flowed very well together, even when the scenes were slower paced I was still invested. Definitely check this one out and give foreign films a chance! Don't use reading subtitles as an excuse to skip fantastic movies like this one, it just makes you look lazy!",Train to Busan
305,Carrzinho,I have had it with these mf zombies on this mf train!!!!,7,1 September 2019,"Korean Zombies (think World War Z) on a train packed with passengers desperately trying to get to Busan. A decent supply of heroes and villains are whittled down in what provides a claustrophobic environment. The limitations of the train are often cleverly exploited with fewer contrived moments. Pace plays a massive role in the movie, that of the zombies and the train, this is balanced with elements of stealth and quiet. As with the best apocalyptic movies the reactions of those in peril and the challenges to social norms are well explored. The characters are earnest and sympathetic, if at times a bit one dimensional.
It does a hell of a lot with must have been a meagre budget, and there's plenty of fun to be had on this rollercoaster. The result may not be up there with the best (28 days/weeks later) but there's something undeniably cool about watching a foreign language action movie, so you can bracket this one with Nikita and The Raid. Not necessarily in terms of quality but in kudos earned. SEVEN",Train to Busan

310,MannyInNewYork,All aboard and feel free to move about the cabin,9,24 May 2018,"Loved it. I saw a YouTube video about hidden gems on Netflix and they recommended this. I am pretty sick of zombie movies (actually I'm very sick of them) but we were bored, nothing else was on and we decided to watch this. The pace is perfect, the acting was so very natural and the horror seems genuine. Actress Su-an Kim was amazing as the young girl traveling with her father. There are several strong performances in this and it makes all the difference. There are no dull moments as it the story moves from interesting to threatening to full out nightmare.You really get pulled into the situation with these people because as I said, the acting is so natural that you feel you've gotten to know a little bit about these people in the short amount of time they are on the screen. My wife never watches horror / zombie movies but this hooked her immediately. There's just something about it that's a cut above most. Not sure if the other reviews contain spoilers or not but I was glad that I knew nothing about the plot other than it involves people , zombie types and a train.

312,gonzallanca,Very Cool,8,2 May 2017,"Opinion about Train to Busan (2016) Train to Busan is a film of the year 2016. Directed by Sang-ho Yeon. Seok-woo (Yoo Gong) an entrepreneur goes on a train to base to see the mother of his daughter (Soo-an). But u zombie apocalypse to prevent them. Passing along with other people must survive on the train. What will? The movie in general I liked a lot. I was as usual with the theme of the zombies. But throughout the film increases the fear of the zombies. The movements of the zombies i found it very good, such as robotic to be transformed.Another important point of the film is the closeness that one has with the main characters, a don't know not how is called but just as you want it. And that is difficult to do. That closeness to the characters are shown in a trilogy, but here we only have one movie to love them.The deaths in the film seem to me to be sooooooooo unexpected, which gives a touch of surprise. Not as The Walking Dead, you say ""Not that cannot die because it is the protagonist"" here that doesn't happen. Anyone can die.What I liked the most of the film is the pace you take. From start to finish. Sitting quietly on the train, to be fighting against zombies. You should not take your eyes to the screen, because you will miss out on something incredible.What I found stupid in the movie, is that if the zombies don't see you don't eat. I found it ridiculous. But it gives a new twist to the movie, something more radical.I liked a lot 8/10",Train to Busan

315,Imaculata,Zombies on a train,8,25 September 2016,"This Korean zombie film is a real gem. It's a very recent movie, and you can tell they had a good budget for this. What I love about these sorts of movies, is when it's all about the survivors having to be clever to overcome frightening and deadly obstacles.Train to Busan is both original in its concept, and great in its execution. It is a movie that is quite clever in how it uses its core premise; the train. They do so much with the concept, plus they keep it relatively realistic. The movie also delivers some great social criticism. Like is often the case with zombie movies, the real monsters are the people.Is it a perfect film? No. I thought the ending was a bit anti-climactic. And there was some use of CGI which looked a bit fake. Specifically some plumes of smoke and fires, and those are the sorts of things they could have done practically. At the same time, the movie deserves praise for it's huge establishing shots where various large train stations and towns really look completely abandoned. There's also a couple of set pieces towards the end that are really impressive.Most importantly, the movie isn't predictable. I had no idea who would live and who would die. And best of all, there were many scenes where I was just grinning and laughing. The movie is fun. The sheer chaos on display in this film is very enjoyable. The movie does not devolve into the grotesque, like so many movies in this genre do. Instead, it focuses on the characters, and on interesting plot developments. And it has so much fun with the genre. It is also a very well paced, and well shot film. It is filmed and paced very much like an American movie.If all of this sounds like a ton of praise... I guess it is. It's a very enjoyable movie. Go see it.",Train to Busan
316,ryan-44110,"Decent movie, slot plot, poor setting, sad, unfulfilling ending",4,29 March 2020,"This movie gets a lot of hype, likely for the way people overly-fetishize anything east-asian at times. This was South Korea's first dig at a zombie focused film and they did fairly well for their efforts. The makeup and effects were mediocre, and the plot too, but overall it had a good basis and is worth a run-through. That said, I'm not going to sugar coat it, I've seen better zombie flicks, and I've seen far worse. This could've passed for an 80's flick, no doubt. There was a lot of cheese, a lot of poor effects effort, hell some of the zombies looked like their regular human counterpart that was shown a few seconds ago. No effort at all to try and transition them over to an undead state aesthetically. There were parts where I paused it to go do something else, out of boredom, just to come back to it and power through. Do I think this deserves the rating it has? Nah. It's good, but let's not go overboard here.",Train to Busan
317,LansTaylor,Good not great,6,8 September 2019,"One of my favorite zombie movie, though parts of it was very predictable. I went into it blind with very little expectation but enjoyed the rollercoaster I was strapped on to.
The characters were okay. I know they were trying to invest a lot of dialogue to keep you emotionally attached to each death but I wasn't feeling it. The hobo guy should've died a long time ago but they kept him around so that there would be someone to save the pregnant women and the kid. The dads death at the end felt forced and was completely unnecessary. He only died for dramatic effect purposes.
I did like one character though, the train conductor. He was always cool, calm, and collective. He tried to save as many people as he could but that ultimately lead to his demise.
It's a good movie but not something I would watch again any time soon.

318,armaansm,A FATHER-OFFSPRING RELATIONSHIP SAGA,9,23 October 2020,"IT IS SAID THAT, BEFORE DEATH, YOUR MOST PRECIOUS MOMENT WOULD APPEAR IN FRONT OF US. WHAT IS YOUR MOST PRECIOUS MOMENT?A workaholic single father Seok-Woo (Gong Yoo) decided to give comfort his daughter Su-an (Kim Su-an) by visiting his ex-wife to Busan. They travelled to Busan by Train from Seoul which was, unfortunately, being victimised by a zombie apocalypse. Misfortune passengers became victim one by one. Someone's sister, someone's best friend, someone's daughter - indeed a pathetic situation. Seok- Woo and Sang-hwa (Ma Dong-seok) who also travelled with his pregnant wife Seong-kyeong (Jung Yu-mi) teamed up and tried to rescue as many passengers as they could. They faced lots of backlash not only from the zombies, but also from the living passengers as well due to shrewd and selfish behaviors of an evil-minded COO. The questions depict:
how many survivors would reach at Busan?
Would Su be able to see her mom?
Apart from the typical zombie horror genre, this movie shows the father-offspring relationship. The challenges that Seok - Woo encountered for his daughter and Sang-hwa for his upcoming child was precious. The movie perfectly displayed how an evil-minded top ranked official threw others into danger for the sake of his own safety even though those people wanted to save him! This movie also showed that being kind is always good and it would eventually come back to our life when we fall into utmost danger.

It's exciting, tragic, and often heroic as he fights to get his daughter to safety. I can honestly say it's the first zombie movie that made me both bite my nails AND cry at the same time.

333,Left_Hand_of_Dog,Great Character Motivated Mayhem,8,14 July 2021,"Over the last 20 years or so, zombies have been terribly overdone in the movie world. I'm pretty tired of them, frankly, so when I find a newer film that works well in this flesh-hungry context, I know something special is going on. Leave it to the Koreans, I suppose, those vanguards of horror cinema, to do things just right.Tonally, Train to Busan is not scary. Let's get that straight. Instead, it rides a line between tension, explosivity, and comedy, doing service to all three. The story follows a father who takes his daughter to see mom in another city. A zombie apocalypse occurs in the surrounding world, which infects the train, and a widening cast of characters must do what they can to survive. Engage action thrusters!Right off the bat, as evidenced by the trailer, the movie looks great. This is a quality production. Whether we're seeing a locked down camera for dramatic character scenes, or engaging in wild carnage, the shots, camera movement and the editing are, in a word, perfect. This is not a small point, either. Action movies are frequently a mess if the direction is poor, and an overreliance of quick cuts is used as a smokescreen for a lack of talent. It's an easy target, but any Transformers film is a great example. The action is terrible for many reasons, not least of which is that all sense of orientation is lost in the chaos of edits. For action to work, you need to know where you stand, where things are in relation to things. It sounds simple, and you'd think it would be, but it's amazing how often it goes wrong. You could also look at the last few Die Hard movies for contradistinction, although I wouldn't recommend it.There are two things in particular that make this movie work, beyond the technically excellent action filmmaking. The first is a devotion to character, manifested in the entirety of Train to Busan's excellent cast. Each player on this kinetic, blood-drenched stage is defined by subtle relationships, whether it be to their child/parent, wife, sister, or boyfriend/girlfriend. These connections are never overstated, as the script does not dive into needless expository elements. Instead, you understand their dimensions right off the bat, and therefore everyone's motivations are clear, and each character is immediately believable and thoroughly humanized, even if they're all essentially just archetypes. This is all to say that the film does a nimble job of introducing and exploring relatable, likeable people. Big check mark.The other lovely thing about this film is its pure kinetical motion, underscored by a love for B-movie splatter. Train to Busan is almost comedically bloody in the best possible sense, as zombies munch humans and humans batter zombies, and once the films starts escalating it becomes epic fun, while still finding time for the characters and audience to breathe. It's very much a game of plateaus. You reach the next level of crazy, take a breather, and then dive back in to the chaos, always with a goal in mind. Save the ones you love.Interestingly, this last thought brings the question of tone to the forefront. As I said, it's not particularly scary, but it has this weird mixture of comedy and drama that almost shouldn't work, but does, thanks to Sang-ho Yeon's immaculate direction. The character elements, all of their fears and relationships, are treated seriously, but the film knows when to indulge in the wackiness of its scenarios to the point that I would characterize the movie as ""fun."" Essentially, the knowledge of when to play things straight, and when to chew the scenery, and not have either element tip the scales too much, is the film's biggest victory. If you want an insane action movie, Sang-ho's got you covered. Ditto for an oddly touching character drama. Just be ready for the metric fuck-tons of gore.FINAL TAKE: Train to Busan is fantastic. It's a simple story that evolves into an absurd spectacle, but the context never overtakes or surmounts its characters. Therefore, even in its most hectic moments, it retains a strong emotional core that carries you through. Train to Busan knows that good action requires good motivation. Splattering skulls is all well and good, but we need to know why doing it matters.",Train to Busan

It was really heartbreaking when the main actor got bitten at the end. My only regret is that why didn't he use his shoe to gag the old man's mouth, so that he won't be able to bite? Were he to do that, he would still be alive with his daughter and the pregnant lady. Not turned into one of them and threw himself off the train.

One of the strongest elements in the film is the screenplay, it works so damn good, giving each character enough time to develop and at the same time keeping us on the edge of our seats with every scene. this movie plays like a video game every level is a scene, and with every level the protagonists go through it gets even harder and more complicated. the actors did an incredible job, I swear to god I nearly cried a couple of times during the run time of the film. Overall this is a very exciting and emotional ride, it's clever with it's pace and character development, the action scenes were brilliantly executed although I don't remember the protagonists killing a single zombie during the entirety of the movie, it also offers a good little twist on the zombie genre, it looks like it was there to serve the advancement of the plot but it's really clever and it worked well. bring some tissues along with you to theater, i dare you not to cry at least once when you see it. 9/10",Train to Busan
338,submitme,If only train rides were this action packed. Solid performances,7,20 September 2016,"This movie, were actually quite refreshing in a way. Sure there has been hundreds of ""zombie-like"" movies. This one were a bit different yet again, but Korean, and also a different setting all together. The movie does contain all the cliché character types of a zombie movie. But they were very dynamic and all of the main characters seemed like they did perform well in their roles. Even without subtitles I enjoyed the movie, and still understood the plot, but I would have preferred subtitles to understand all the conversations.The train idea, actually worked really well, and made for some interesting sequences, with drama and a claustrophobic feel. Most of the scenarios seemed plausible, but there were a couple of times where I think the CGI were unrealistic, but surely put in there for a more dramatic feel. I think the ""passive bystander"" suspense, were a bit overused, maybe again to try and draw on the drama. Other than that, the movie were overall quite well done.",Train to Busan
339,gloriahur,Physical and mental catastrophes on the way to Busan,8,22 October 2016,"I was actually very excited for this movie to be released, because I would've never imagined a zombie movie made it Korea, that's even set in a very-Korean setting- the train to Busan. The trailer was really interesting and the movie was even better. Some things that distracted me were some points in the story which I didn't quite understand why it had to happen and some frustrating parts.I also was a little worried how this zombie movie would turn out, how the effects might not be very realistic, and how it might be just one of those cliché Korean dramatic movies. However, it was much more thrilling and focused than I had expected it to be. The situations were realistic and somehow relatable to what can actually happen in Korea, and the rest of the world even. Not as in the zombie virus spreading, but what could cause people to die and how people would react to such calamity.The reaction of the people was actually one of the best parts of the movie. Unlike most zombie movies, that focus more on the grotesque effects and horrifying happenings, this movie focuses on the psychological conflicts between the people and within oneself. It is quite tragic what happens in the movie, but that makes it more sensible and realistic. I could really get into the mood and the nervous terror of the situations in the movie, and of course, with the aid of some great actors and actresses.",Train to Busan

343,jvontheprowl,Tired of zombie movies.,7,29 May 2021,"People aren't going to like my opinion in that zombies are easy mode bad guys and that some how they can do everything superman can now.I enjoyed the movie. It became tiresome with bizarre moments that defy explanation. Just because you can make anything do about everything, doesn't mean you should. The zombies became cartoonishly silly by the end.The end had moments where the previous movie sort of got lazy. Wounds not making any sense and incredibly stupid mistakes that you would not ever do just to force the desired ending.I'm a nit picker and noticed that right away. Had to take a star off for that one moment that mucked the story up.It is definitely a movie worth seeing. That's if you still like zombie movies. Someone needs to make an effort in the horror genre to take chances. If this movie came out 10 years prior, it would have been spot on. I just roll my eyes when I see zombies in any movie advertisement. What fantastical feats are they going to do this time?",Train to Busan

345,Vikingbyheart,A great horror action zombie film!,8,29 September 2016,"Horror movies were never the same after the zombie trilogy by the director George Andrew Romero. In Night of the Living Dead (1968) we were presented to zombies who eat human flesh, a thriller mixing horror and social criticism. In the second film, Dawn of the Dead (1978), besides the social satire about paranoia and humanity to the brink of apocalypse, the movie explores the comic potential of zombies, especially black humor. We are the headless and cannibalistic beings who roam the cities. Closing the trilogy, Day of the Dead (1985) continues with the social criticism and the comic tone, but relies on a more depressive and gloomy scenario, apart from the use of graphic violence. Following the footsteps of George Romero we have the gore Braindead (1992), the horror 28 Days Later (2002) and Rec (2007), and in humor genre, Shaun of the Dead (2004), Zombieland (2007) and Død snø - Dead Snow (2009).The South Korean movie Busanhaeng (original title) or Train to Busan (english title) focuses on horror and action, with some moments of suspense. Written and directed by Sang-ho Yeon (known for the zombie animation Seoul Station - 2016), the film tells the story of a financial sector executive, Seok Woo (played by Yoo Gong, known for Do-ga-ni - Silenced - 2011) who agrees to travel with his daughter, Soo-an (represented by Soo Kim-an), from the capital Seoul to the city of Busan for she spends some time with her mother (Seok's ex- wife). After embarking on a modern express train (KTX) passengers discover that an epidemic is raging South Korea, turning much of the population into zombies. With an infected person on board and the disease rapidly spreading, father, daughter and other passengers will have to fight for survival and for their lives, trapped inside a high-speed moving train.The director Sang-ho Yeon does a great job, managing to immerse the viewer in the plot. Despite most of the action been set in a train the film has a dynamic narrative and impresses for its visual and technical accuracy. Unlike the slow zombies of George Romero's trilogy in Train to Busan they are extremely agile, threatening and lethal. Another highlight is the cast. The characters are well developed, even for a horror movie and the actors deliver relevant performances, especially Sang Hwa (played by Dong-seok Ma, known for Joheunnom Nabbeunnom Isanghannom - The Good, The Bad, The Weird - 2008), the girl in the role of the daughter, Soo-an Kim, and Yoo Gong acting as the father. The soundtrack and sound effects are moderate, providing genuine scares.There are still some elements in the movie of South Korean culture, as the obsession with education and study, and a strong critique of modern society. The quest for professional success even at the expense of family and leisure time is questioned in the film, as well as the social tension. Moral and ethical conflicts involving empathize or not for others and follow or not the animal instinct of self- preservation are exploited by different profiles of the surviving passengers.Despite having some clichés of the zombie genre Busanhaeng is a great horror film, with good moments of suspense, well-constructed action scenes, a well-chosen cast and the right amount of tension to captivate the viewer.",Train to Busan
346,Blueskies4020,LOLOLOL,1,11 March 2018,"This movie is SO heavily overrated, I can't even fathom why. If you want to watch a real horror movie, please scroll through. If you are looking to be entertained, or better yet, if you are one of those people who like horror movies mixed in with the sub mediocre comedy, like the 'Scary Movie' types, only then do I recommend this.I basically laughed out so loudly throughout most of this movie. The acting was so hilarious and overdone and painfully forced. The behaviour of the 'zombies' was unpredictable because sometimes when the plot wanted it they could walk only slowly, sometimes run away like athletes with ghoulishly done faces, and sometimes just look too lost, it almost felt they were sympathetic of the main characters sad life. I cried laughing. I love horror movies, but this is not a good portrayal of one.",Train to Busan
347,davelowen,The best zombie movie I have ever seen,10,23 August 2016,"The best zombie film I have ever seen (outside of the comedy Shaun of the Dead). Such a great film. It starts exactly like a train ride gathering momentum and gaining speed. The only difference with this train ride is I didn't want it to stop. It has a brilliant script, fantastic effects plus a very good choice of cast and acting. It also has a 'credible' plot (as credible as you can get with the zombie genre). Many of the scenes will stay with me for a long time. I hear that Hollywood want to do a remake of it. It will be interesting if it will be done as well as this. I thoroughly recommend this very refreshing and fast paced film. Get a ticket and enjoy the ride!",Train to Busan

Unlike in American counterpart where the scare factor are heavily dependent on graphics ( blowing zombies brains, victims eaten alive with their insides hanging out on their tummy , explosion , etc) TTB zombies looks like just wounded people with seizure and cataract (but they bites!) which is refreshing. Actually Its funny that even some of them are already infected, they still good looking! I don't know if that's a good thing or a biggest flaw for a zombie flick. After I watched it, I suddenly have urge to binge on zombie themed movies. So I learned that TTB MIGHT similar to quarantine where people trap inside airplane instead! (kind of) and there's a kid too. Is possible to have a sequel ""Plane to Busan""? Because I feel we need a closure for this wonderfully made zombie thriller.

The Walking Dead bored me.This Korean movie will likely (like Oldboy) get a US remake so the snowflakes who are upset by subtitles will get to see a Hollywoodized version at some point in the future. No doubt the plot will be changed through committee interference. In this movie, our protagonist isn't the most likable person... and don't expect Hollywood to leave his character arc untouched.Enjoy this one in its present form. It does an excellent job with a growing feeling of dread that turns into an all out chase film with twists and surprising script decisions. Some old character stereotypes are worked in, but there are plenty of unexpected turns and clever solutions.Like The Host, another Korean film I particularly like, there's family drama at the core. But it doesn't overwhelm the sheer ferocity of the action.",Train to Busan

The most moving is the last scene. The voice of the little girl singing rings in the railway tunnel. The soldiers in the distance put down their guns and they were saved...

354,ascendant01,"In the vein of 28 Days Later -- a great ""zombie"" movie",8,6 February 2017,"This is a seriously GOOD movie! You really need to watch this movie if you are into zombie flicks in the vein of ""28 Days Later""! I am not well versed in the S. Korean movie industry, however, if this is any indication of future offerings I will be watching a lot of Korean flicks. I don't like watching movies by subtitles but in this movie it didn't hinder the quality or the suspension of reality at all! --- As I said before, this movie is in the vein of 28 Days Later, which was, in my opinion, the first and best modern age zombie flick since the original ""Night Of The Living Dead"" way back in 1968. I give props to NOTLD because it was the first, but I never liked the premise of those movies, in that they try to tell the watcher that something can actually bring you back from actual death. I am sorry but to my sciences oriented mind that just does not work. However, a plague that turns humans into homicidal psychopathic lunatics is believable in my mind. In fact there are actual examples of such things in nature right now. There are fungi that literally attack an insect's brain and turn insects into zombies that do their bidding in infecting others and moving to the best place for the fungus to send out its spores and such. So 28 Days Later really worked for me and so does ""Train to Busan""! And the acting in the movie was great too, especially from the little girl. I have to admit at first I thought this was another Japanese SciFi flick, but after 5 minutes into the movie it hit me that this wasn't Japanese. If this is an example of the S.Korean film industry to come Japan had better get better and fast or just step aside because S. Korea is in the house.",Train to Busan
355,Clockwork_Orange55,Overrated Korea,6,22 February 2017,"""28 Days later"", ""28 Weeks Later"", and both George A. Romero's ""Night of the Living Dead""and ""Dawn of the Dead"" (And also Zack Snyder's remake) – these are the great movies of the horror-zombie genre; although we could all agree that Romero started it all. Then in 2016, in the south of Korea, we got another zombie flick. I can't tell on how this movie was being received worldwide, but here in Singapore, the 'praises' for it is a bit overdone in my opinion. The result is predictable as neo-musical genre 'K-POP' is popular here. So, any entertainment that shows intimacy with the mentioned phenomenon, will get extra attention.A young fund manager (Gong Yoo) agrees to bring his daughter (Kim Su-an) to Busan to visit her mother. Since the child's parents are separated, I assume the two parties occasionally meet one another. From the start to the point upon the boarding of the train for Busan, the movie is well made. 'Zombies' in norm only needs one infected for the thrill to start. Hence, in ""Train to Busan"" an infected manages to secretly board the train.Director Yeon Sang-ho's effort in exploiting small details can easily be admired. The images of emergency vehicles, the all- encompassing violent fires at the near top of a building and ashes steadily settling down from it – all allow audiences to sense something unsound had happened, although we all know that it is the omnipresent of zombie outbreak.That's it. After the first zombie begins to bite, the movie goes into a nosedive motion. Action sequences are surprisingly bland; I cannot specifically describe on what's lacking but it lacks genuine excitement. The writing for the characters too shares the same fate (especially the villain) as they are clichéd. What ""Train to Busan"" tried to depict on the 'colours' of its characters had already been done by dozens of movies before; worst when it lays out that idea before our very eyes and never challenges the audiences. And visual style is straight terrible. The only element which remains to be positive is the effective use of suspense throughout the movie.As a zombie-genre fan, I quickly got for myself a ticket to experience it at the cinema but only to leave the hall feeling disappointed. My criticism does not mean I abhor Korean movies. Movie fans in general would know that Koreans had made great films for the past years. One of them is ""I Saw the Devil"" by Kim Jee- Woon, which is a masterpiece in any way. But unfortunately this ""Train to Busan"" is vastly overrated.Cinematicmadness.blogspot.com",Train to Busan

357,ryanmoynihan,Train to Busan,8,7 January 2021,"Train to Busan follows some pretty simple character arcs and story beats, but it's so much fun and so well crafted that it doesn't really matter.There are some predictable key plot points from the beginning. We know the father, stuck in business mode so often he can't even remember what gifts he's given his daughter over the years, will become more compassionate and present by the end. And we know that the evil characters will get theirs before the credits roll. But you know what? Those are the kind of story elements that can be very exciting in the right place. I want to see evil people get what they deserve. I want to see the business man become a good father. And I want to see the kind hearted child survive despite the selfish adults who surround her. These are moments that have me cheering the movie on even if I kind of already know where it's heading. It's like a warm blanket covered in zombie guts. I feel comfortable and disgusted all in one.Even with all this said, the movie is undeniably exciting. Action scenes are well shot and never feel too closed in to see what's happening. This is a very real concern for a movie that takes place predominantly on a train.There was an honest sense of loss when some characters died too. While most of them were underdeveloped there were a few that I felt like I really got to know in just under 2 hours. I think that was mostly due to some really great performances. It's all in their faces. Dong-seok Ma knocked it outta the park. He came off so smug at first but then evolves into your manly, trustworthy dad who doesn't know how to change his ringtone. It's so good. Su-an Kim is another standout. She is so quiet and reserved at the start, then as things continue to fall apart around her she has so much opportunity to show a range of emotions like anguish and fear. She killed it. This is a great child performance.The cg and make up effects are phenomenal. Some that were especially impressive were the zombie movements and the zombie deer in the opening. They sometimes looked a bit off but that only added to the charm.",Train to Busan
358,fikamugg,This is a masterpiece,9,9 April 2017,"If Hollywood ever decides to remake this title my advice to the audience is clear: DON'T BOTHER! It has been a while since i saw a really good movie. A movie that can compete for the 20 best or so list but Train to Busan not only made me smile it also impressed me on many levels. It's without a doubt the best modern zombie movie since 28 days later. The story and the script are well crafted and the characters are likable just like in 28 days later. The zombies are running, thank god.7 seasons with the walking dead has not only nearly bored me to death it has also made me realize how important it is that zombies in a zombie flick are really frightening and not some stupid dead meat you can whack half sleeping. The zombies and the effects in Train to Busan have the touch of a major studio production, which in itself of course is not a guarantee for success. Who doesn't remember the miserable effects in I am legend? Also 28 days later did not have a particularly big budget but succeeded anyway, so its not about the money, rather the quality, and the quality in TTB is top notch. The zombie-crowd scenes for instance feels more believable and well made compared with World War Z even though the comparison is not 100% since the zombie crowd-scenes in WWZ were massively crowded.I can't find many weak points even the music appears in the right places and adds something, especially at the end when the story takes a sad turn. The only minus comes with the choice of a train as the center piece of the story. On the surface TTB shows similarities with a movie like Flight of the living dead. But the zombies on a plane - zombies on a train duality is just a play with words. The comparison of the two films is unfair. With splendid actors and more complex layer of emotions TTB has ambitions other than to make you laugh. Despite the unsexy choice of playground TTB is running for 1.57 and you won't even notice. Just another sign of how good this bad-ass Korean zombie film is.",Train to Busan

On the whole after watching it I felt this was set at the same time as World War Z, just from a South Korean point of view. 
The action was well placed and kept you going confined on the tight space of a train it felt claustrophobic and again reminded me of the zombie outbreak on the plane in WWZ.

Korean movies is also home to some of the most terrifying, spine-chilling, and effective jumpscare usage in horror movies of all time. This movie captures both aspects successfully. The scoring in this movie is just right, and the visuals provided with each shot is definitely jaw-dropping.The movie does lack in several aspects, such as inexplicable plot points, questionable decisions by the characters, and some lagging in storytelling by the latter half of the movie.

372,ginahiza,Better than world war Z!,10,8 April 2021,"This deserves a way higher rating the world war z. Why you might ask? WWZ is extremely cliché we don't feel bad for any of the characters because there's nothing attaching us to them. You know exactly what's gonna happen as soon as you see the zombies. The acting was good no problem there obviously but it's not something I'd watch again too predictable. Train to busan on the other hand is a unique zombie movie. It's slightly more realistic too when it comes to scenarios. Rather than being in an open area and being able to fly around everywhere in a helicopter during an apocalypse 🙄 they're confined and trapped in a realistic place.... a train. The fact that they used mostly real zombies for this movie is a great idea as it adds to the realism and scariness of them. When you put a bunch of cgi for a zombie you know it's fake and therefore it doesn't have much effect. The acting in train to busan was superb, especially from the father of the young girl and the young girl herself. Certain scenes had me balling my eyes out which I rarely do in zombie movies because all they focus on is the zombies and the main character becoming a hero and saving everyone. It was very well done considering they had a limited set. I absolutely loved it.",Train to Busan
373,djhoschman,4 nothing more,4,3 November 2020,"I dont get why this Movie gets such a high Rating? Ah, after i scrolled through the Reviews it was clear. Almost all Koreans voted a 10 for this Movie! Yeah ok, it is finally a Korean Movie that you dont turn off after 5 Minutes, here you can stand 30 Minutes after you fell asleep. Thats a Huge Improvement in the Korean Movie Industry.
Many Reviews sayd ""A Korean Zombie Movie show Hollywood how its made"". Really? Every 30 Year old Zombie Movie from the US is way better than this attempt.The Main Characters are not likeable, not good actors and the Script is so poorly written, that the Movie felt like a cheap TV Movie.
FX are not good, Zombies are laughable, Story was ok.. Overall a not really bad Movie but nothing Great or good. Just a Ok Movie with unused Potential, and a lot of Hype that doesnt make sense.",Train to Busan
374,DigitalShark1,An Emotional Thrill Ride (get it),8,20 October 2021,"Train to Busan really took me by surprise. I thought it was going to be another generic zombie movie, certainly looks that way by how it's promoted, but once you watch it, you realize just how much care and passion went into this project.Train to Busan is about a series of characters trying to survive a zombie apocalypse onboard a train that needs to get past stops, roadblocks and a ever-growing crew of zombies slowly working it's way up the train.Even though there's such a huge cast of characters, none of them feel boring or forgettable. In short time, Train to Busan establishes distinct characters that you remember the quotes of and cry when they're eventually eaten. The large cast of characters also lends itself to the tense atmosphere of the whole film. No one feels safe from the zombie horde and it's anyone's guess to who gets axed off next.Train to Busan is the most engaging zombie movie I've seen in a really long time. But please god, watch it subbed. I promise you, you might feel the need to watch the dub, but I promise you, it's better subbed. Reading is not that bad, I promise.",Train to Busan

379,davidlmarks,One hell of a train ride!!!,10,27 October 2016,"Wow.Where do I even begin? This movie shows that Hollywood does not own the monopoly on quality film making. But checking out the quality of the entertainment of late coming from Hollywood, that's not really a stretch.All young Su-an (played by Soo-an Kim) wants for her birthday is to spend it with her mother. So her separated and unengaged father Seok Woo (played by Yoo Gong) attempts to fulfill her wish. Her mother lives in Busan. That's a relatively unconventional short train ride, and with some coaxing, off they go.But, of course, the train ride is anything but unconventional.News filters into passengers on the train that something horrible is affecting people, turning them into crazed rabid flash eaters. Little do they know that this is about to infect the people on the train as well.Along with Seok Woo and Su-an, there are a whole host of great secondary characters that round out the cast. Like cheerleader Ahn So-hee, reluctant boyfriend and amateur baseball player Young Gook (and the rest of the team), Sang Hwa, a linebacker or sumo wrestler or just a plain bad-ass, and his expectant wife Sung Gyeong. Do NOT mess with this man's wife and child! The train is a perfect setting for a zombie apocalypse showdown. The train can not stop at stations because they are all over-run by the hordes, and the living passengers are continually being squeezed into tighter and tighter quarters by the increasing number of swarming undead that move like World War Z zombies-on-meth.Train to Busan is one of the best zombie action flicks I've seen in a long time. Director Sang-ho Yeon does an amazing job with pacing, the acting is top notch, and the screenplay (also written by Sang-ho Yeon) is visceral and touching.Highly highly recommend!",Train to Busan
380,gulfaran786,Very little to complain about,9,8 January 2017,It's a great Zombie movie that focuses more emphasis on the people rather than the fact that Zombies are running around. Unlike the majority of movies in this genre. Character development is right on the money even for those who only get a short amount of time or lines on screen. I have a few bones to pick with the way things were carried out on 2 occasions in the movie but to an extent it is part of what makes it great because I'm left thinking backwards about how things could have gone differently only if this happened. Then I think further back and say the same thing. It's a must watch. You will be invested in the characters completely.,Train to Busan

388,safeatbase,Absolute masterpiece!,10,20 November 2020,"Man, South Korea has got it going on! I happened on this movie randomly, completely unaware of its fame and awards offshore. I watched it simply wondering what is a Korean zombie movie like because I had been long over the genre and especially The Walking Dead. What I watched was character development at its most refined fineness.Seok-woo starts as a typical father working much harder at his job than at his relationship with his daughter. The quickly unfolding and non-stop dangerous turn of events reveals what is most important to him, and shows he is not cold, that he does have a heart. The flashback at the end...as a father, I cried.Sang-hwa's crass, rude nature initially paints him as a selfish oaf who thinks he's better than everyone else. The quickly unfolding and non-stop dangerous turn of events reveals that he is quite the opposite. He is selfless, has a great sense of humor, and is the kind of person you'd prefer at your side if you were dealing with a zombie breakout.What director Sang-ho Yeon focuses on is not the action or the scares, but the characters. How they respond to the circumstances that challenge their ability to survive and care for others is like seeing a flower bloom. I feel like his whole point of the movie was to make us ask ourselves ""Who are we truly?"" We got bogged down with our careers. We take relationships for granted. We act hardcore in non threatening situations. But what happens when hysteria and danger overwhelm your atmosphere? Who do you care about most then? What's the absolute most important thing in your life? I'll tell you again...the ending. Ugh, I cried watching a zombie movie!",Train to Busan

392,rehams,A new classic in Zombie films,9,18 December 2016,"I'm a big fan of zombie movies and Train to Busan did not disappoint, and once again leads to me to believe Korean cinema, not Japanese, is still the most creative of Asian films.Train to Busan takes place almost entirely within a high speed train. We follow a group of passengers, a stockbroker father with his daughter, on the way to see her mom, a team of baseball players, a CEO and a couple where the woman is pregnant. The film has some great characters and we quickly come to care about them, which is critical in such a film. There's a great sense of humor throughout, I laughed most at the husband to the pregnant wife, a macho character of sorts.The plot premise is simple, a zombie outbreak spreads at blinding speed through Korea, and so does it aboard the train. The challenge: can our heroes survive the train ride to Busan. Much happens underway and no need to spoil it. What makes Train to Busan a great zombie movie is it's part great scares, high tempo, humor. great characters and non-sentimentality. If that sounds like a lot of positive things to say, that is because the movie deserves it. It really is a must see for fans of the genre.Overall the film reminds me of 28 Days Later, including the fast zombies. Definitely watch it.",Train to Busan
393,cathey-127,Almost perfect aside from a few issues & inconsistencies,9,26 October 2021,"So overall this is a thrilling film that has depth and packs emotional punch. The movie keeps you on the edge of your seat with the looming zombie attacks, and also has fantastic character arcs. I really enjoyed how the lead character became a better man over the course of the movie, and all the side characters were very well fleshed out too. You really grow to love some of the characters and hate others. There are people who choose to help others, those who sacrifice themselves, those who sacrifice others, and those who take revenge. It's all a great display of humanity and I think it's really great that a zombie apocalypse film had so much depth.Ok about the bad stuff (spoilers ahead). The zombie turning process had no consistency. The first girl was able to run away from the zombie at the station, get on the train, and stay conscious for a while before she turned. After that, most people only took mere seconds between getting bitten and starting to bite people themselves. I thought it was about the site at first (limbs take longer than face/neck), but then the school girl started spasming immediately after a bite on her leg. I get that they're going for the effect of zombies swarming, but this takes ppl out of it a bit.Next up, the scene at Daejeon station had so may logical flaws. The captain didn't even know about the zombies (riots) in some compartments in the train, but only the humans had their compartment doors open. The zombies were still trapped. If all doors opened, the zombies in the trains should've gotten to the humans first. And it was really crazy when the humans just walked off the train and walked outside unsuspecting. The COO guy was evil but he made perfect sense here: there's no way that station was safe. Watching all those people walk past bloody riot gear to find the military zombies had me screaming at the screen. The chase itself was also a bit too scripted. The protagonist surviving off of plot armor, the 4 guys holding the glass door against the zombie swarm, and the big guy Jon Snowing the zombies before getting on the train were all just way too dramatic.Once they were back in the train, the action of the 3 guys trying to rescue their loved ones was good, but why would you take off your clothes and expose your skin? Once they got back to the last compartment, I really don't get why they're so hell bent on getting in the last compartment, instead of focusing more on fighting off the zombies that are trying to get in. For a long time they only had one guy holding the door. The men could've closed the door and covered the glass with something so the zombies don't see them. And then after a while maybe the people on the other side could let them in since they're clearly not infected. Breaking the glass was also weakening the defense.I really don't get the old woman for giving up her life in front of her sister. She was just at the door. That led to her sister letting the zombies in to kill the entire compartment, which was all really unnecessary. And the people in the compartment were all really weird to force the new comers into another compartment that was further from the zombies. Shouldn't you want the safer one? And what if they really do turn into zombies later? How would you get out with zombies at both doors?And the last fight. After fighting several compartments of zombies the protagonist really froze at the evil COO turning huh? Tho yeah he was meant to sacrifice himself for his daughter in the end anyway, so I guess it had to happen.I still think this film is great despite these logical flaws. But it probably could've been more convincing if it had more consistency and less brain fart from the characters.",Train to Busan

It's pretty much just another zombie movie. It really adds nothing to the genre. I just wish there was more about this movie to take in, but there's not. I don't see myself ever rewatching this movie, it just isn't that great.The characters are all just okay. As most would agree, the big Jackie Chan-looking guy was the best. The main Dad character was pretty bland. His ending arc was kinda cheesy, like a typical Korean Drama.Then we have the typical over-the-top d-bag villian. The writers went out of there way to get the audience to hate the guy as much as possible. I don't know, just seems cheap, in my opinion. Th villian was pretty lame and cliche.But what's up with so many people gushing over the pretty cheerleader? Don't get my wrong, she is quite pretty, but too many people are making a huge deal out of her beauty when it's not even nesscary. Guys acting like virgins who's never seen a pretty girl before. I've even seen reviews that just talk about this girls looks, and barely review the movie itself, then they rate it like a 9/10 or 10/10, LOL! Why would someone base a movie review off the looks of just one character? That doesn't make sense for a movie review.But for all the characters, they lacked real actual character development. They are all kinda bland, one-note, and with not much real growth. But the movie is more focused on just them escaping zombies. This movie would've been amazing if they developed the characters more and had some originality for the zombie genre.The movie is still worth seeing for the amazing special effects and suspense. It's best watched with friends or girlfriend. But movie is nothing of substance that will stick with you, for me at least.",Train to Busan

These things are the same as the afflicted people in World War Z, in movement and the sheer number of them. They are the result of some kind of infection or virus.That being said, this was a really good movie. The characters were believable and great. You love the good guys and really hate the bad guy. I was fortunate enough to catch the version dubbed in English so it was very easy to watch. Lots of action and blood. The fact that they were stuck on the train created claustrophobic terror.

I would be surprised if this film was not influenced in any way by those two films or at least one of them.On another note, sitting in the theater, not knowing which movie was to be played, it was a bit eerie seeing the subtitle ""Quarantine"" whilst watching a film occurring in East Asia, as we are still in the midst of the pandemic.

On the other hand, I invite the reviewers to show some respect to the women in this film. This schoolgirl/cheerleader conversation created here is just sexist and disrespectful. It is not even a big plot point , one of the characters being a schoolgirl, so what? I thought teenage (underage probably) girl fantasies were unwelcome in this post ""me too"" era but apperantly many people still think the other gender only as a ""gift to men"".

If you had no idea this film was a horror, or that it featured zombies, it might be quite exciting but I imagine most people will go into this knowing exactly what to expect.Some kind of catastrophe has led to an outbreak in which dozens of writhing undead are roaming the streets of Seoul looking for their next victims. A group of travellers including main lead Gong Yu are on the train to Busan. They've barely gone twenty minutes before there is clearly something wrong with some of the passengers. Checking the situation on their phones, the passengers see that the country is in a state of emergency.Cover.jpgThey try to leave at the next station but find that the soldiers who are waiting for them have already been bitten. The most exciting and tense scenes are when the group must flee back on to the zombie ridden train, running away from swarms of rabid recruits. Once back on its a long journey for the remainder of the film. Here's where the film runs out of steam. Once you've seen one zombie, you've seen them all. The film becomes a very standard struggle for survival and the scenes of characters running down train corridors become very repetitive.It's not a bad film. Its directed in expedient fashion but for a train film its seriously lacking any ambient sound effects such as the clickety-clack sound you would expect of a train on a track (or do South Korean trains run completely silently?).Fans of zombies will not be disappointed.Otherwise, it's more of what we've already seen many times over.My score: 6/10.",Train to Busan

The movie tried to send a moral message across to its audience with the main protagonist shown to be a selfish prick at first, but as the film progresses he learns throughout his horrific train ride that he needs to be a caring father. A strange message for a zombie movie I thought. Of course the zombies aren't the only bad guys, as some of the living can be dicks too and they're the ones who get everyone killed whilst getting killed themselves.

413,erikdlcd,Not what I expected from a zombie movie,8,28 March 2020,"I've seen this movie being mentioned here and there on social media and many called it ""the best zombie movie of all time"", so going into this movie I expected some cool action scenes with some original takes on zombie apocalypses. This movie has all that and more. What wasn't mentioned about this movie was how dramatic and emotional it was while also displaying social criticism. But those aren't the movie's best qualities. The movie's best quality are the characters and how and why they act. They act logically and think creatively to solve their problems while also being pressured by their emotions and/or the herd mentality to maybe act differently. Sure, there are some clichés and some exaggerated action scenes but overall it's a great movie that everyone should watch. 8/10.",Train to Busan

I dunno if that is how the Koreans do stuff (I've only seen one other Korean horror film that I know of, The Host) but this was a sweet and spicy movie. The spicy part was all over the place in the form of slavering hordes of really stressed out zombies who probably need to chill. There was plenty of action and distinct rounded characters in some big scenes.
The sweet was the truly tragic note to the finale which, like in The Host really grabbed you in the feels. Kim Soo An is a great actor and I hope they didn't do something nasty to make her cry like that.",Train to Busan

I once saw this on Netflix and I was rather stunned at how impressively well-constructed the concept, plot, and character interactions turned out to be.It's as simple as a train ride to another part of Korea gone awry due to a Zombie Infestation. Most of the main characters do quite amazing work at staying alive. But as you'd expect, the majority end up dying eventually. Even the Main Protagonist ends up biting the dust towards the end of the film.

Furthermore, the makeup and/or masks of the zombies is not realistic or cool at all. For sure you won't miss the blood stain in the orange color. This movie doesn't follow the same rules as the usual Hollywood movies. It seems very important to the director to point out some ethical views, unfortunately the same aspect over and over.So what's left?I think some pretty nice and fresh ideas. I really like the minimalist setting with the train. This doesn't give the story that much space and I think ""not that much of space"" is a key point in Zombie movies. Despite the expected little space for storytelling the Story is not getting boring at all.At the end you may say ""Well, this was an enjoyable movie"" but you will also report some scenes of the movie to a friend with a surprisingly high motivation.",Train to Busan

I hate when they add comedy into something that is suppose to be scary and this did none of that. The main characters were great!! The little girl deserves an award!! Probably one of my favorite zombies films. I did watch the second one and regretfully didn't finish it but that's another review.

I've watched Train to Busan a couple of times now, and it keeps my attention on it every time.Zombie movies are almost as numerous as zombie books, it seems. You get to the point where it's like ""Okay, been there, done that."" So it takes a certain kind of zombie film to make you want to watch it more than once.Train to Busan starts off a bit slow, but it's necessary. By the end of it, I was rooting for the surviving characters, and cheering for the director and some of the choices that they made. The ending is wonderfully done. The last 15 minutes or so of the film are almost impossible to look away from.I normally go for Norwegian movies for my foreign film fix, but South Korea is definitely start to get my attention.

Yes, I can admit that there were a few wonky decisions made by some of the side characters at times, but for the most part, the acting in this film was stellar (not just for the main cast, but for the zombie actors too, they were terrific).I think people these days have grown to anticipate a protagonist that is selfless and immediately likeable, but South Korean cinema often transforms their lead characters through experiences, or sometimes would just outright highlight the 'dual' aspect to human nature, which is to make 'good' or 'bad' decisions depending on the circumstances.I gave it a 9/10 because it is in my all-time top 5 zombie films list, and because it can be re-watched many times and still be entertaining.",Train to Busan

432,dollypeppers,A Powerful Story About Humanity with All Its Good and Bad,9,9 January 2018,"Wow. I'm still crying. This movie was beautiful. I don't mean that aesthetically because as a zombie movie, with all the gore that comes with the genre, it's not pretty to look at. The zombies are all very gross, satisfyingly so to a zombie aficionado but undoubtedly a bit much for the average person. The zombie deer in particular is NASTY the way it twists itself back onto its feet after being hit by the car. But the zombies aren't the point of the movie and aren't why the film is beautiful so I'll move on.This film explores both innate human selfishness and innate human selflessness in both aspects. Our main character is a father who spends too much time working and not enough time with his (ADORABLE!!!) daughter. He's made himself such a stranger to his child that he buys her a Wii which she already has, and from what I was given to understand he purchased for her a previous holiday(though that may be wrong as I don't speak Korean and the subtitles went by fast). At one point Dear Old Dad flat out tells his kid to only look out for herself, not to do anything as simply kind as to give her seat up to an elderly woman. So Dad starts off in a very selfish place and then there's the other guy, whose name I didn't care to catch, some suited jerk that LEAVES PEOPLE TO THE ZOMBIES REPEATEDLY. Wow, why is it always like that in zombie movies? If the zombie apocalypse does happen, I'm going to be sorely tempted to kick any dude in a suit out of my space before he screws me over. Anyway the selfishness of humanity is on full display when Suit Jerk convinces a car full of people not to help the elderly woman, a pregnant woman and her husband, Dad and his daughter, and some poor kid. He actually gets them kicked out of the car for no reason than his own selfishness and fear. Suit Jerk also sacrifices two train employees to make his escape and throws a teenage girl to the zombies. What a sorry excuse for a human being! But that's selfishness for you and that's not what makes the movie beautiful so I must move on.It's the kindness and selflessness of multiple characters that won my heart, made this movie a beautiful story and caused me to give it 5 stars. It starts small, the little girl giving up her seat to the old woman but it grows. Dad shakes off his bad attitude after being called out by the Father to Be of the Pregnant Lady's baby and he starts actively helping to save people. Father to Be later pulls a heroic sacrifice to hold a door so the group can get into a train car that doesn't contain zombies, but before he does he shouts to his wife what their child's name will be. I cried. I still am sniffling. And the sports kid, he goes on a mission to free Dad's daughter, the Pregnant Lady and the old woman from a train bathroom with no benefit to himself. He does it because it's The Right Thing To Do. And I can't forget the disheveled guy, this poor man spends half his time tripping or alerting the zombies by making unintentional noise and he pulls another heroic sacrifice to save the girl and Pregnant Lady. IF YOU AREN'T CRYING THEN I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO TELL YOU. In fact, helping others is the only way anybody stays alive. Everyone who makes selfish choices not only dies, but causes the deaths of those around them(Suit Jerk gets the whole train car full of people eaten). Yes the selfless choice of sacrifice also gets some people killed but they knowingly give their lives so others can go on. The reward is that others live. That's what makes this movie beautiful, it looks at the lesson Dad attempted to teach his daughter at the beginning and it goes ""No. Humanity does not survive by looking out for only yourself. Humanity survives by virtue of the courage to help others, to give, to GO BACK FOR PEOPLE, to be a HERO."" In a time where it is fashionable to put forth stories where #1 looks out for only #1, where you are told that some people are too slow, useless and not worth the effort, this movie makes the case that salvation is not earned by abandoning your fellow man but earned through being willing to look past yourself and Do What Is Right.And I'm sure there's symbolism to be found in the child and woman passing through the dark tunnel and being saved by the child singing but I'm too sad(in a good way) by the movie's end to figure it out.",Train to Busan

So when I heard about this Train to Busan one and saw the high ratings, I rushed to watch it. And what a joke! I'm not going to recount the plot as they're pretty much all the same with apocalyptic zombie movies. What makes them different are the characters and how they act in such situations. This move, the characters are all just spineless morons. Imagine all the dumb teenagers from any horror movie that repeatedly do stupid, unrealistic things over and over and over until they all get picked off one bye one. Now transplant them into a bunch of teenagers, adults, and senior citizens and stick them all into a train. Yes, this is a zombie movie, so I can suspend reality for a bit, but c'mon! At least have somewhat sensible people. The repeat offenders of bad choices are all over this movie.Watching this was annoying and frustrating. Was it scary ever? Not at all, just a bunch of people with painted on veins and bad hair. We've all seen better ones in Dawn of the Dead and the 28 Days/Weeks ones. Did I care about any of the characters surviving?

443,jannisschaefer,Not a No brainer at all!,10,1 March 2021,"I've repeatedly heard some say that this movie is an absolute no brainer. I don't know if that's the majority of viewers that share the opinion, but I firmly disagree. This movie is such a refreshing zombie movie, the likes of which I've never seen in Zombie movies following the turn of the new millenium. The train provides an oppressive and anxiety inducing location, riddled with a heavy atmosphere that kept me tense. Even when they're not on the train the zombie spectacle is near impeccable and flawless. The zombies are great and seem to advance a lot of the things we got in the remake of Dawn of the Dead in 2003, with the charging and franticly running, contorting, non cautious, careless, relentless attitude. I never really got the appeal of the slow lumbering zombies, they just always felt Like they're a threat either as a horde or on accident. Don't get me wrong and misunderstand me saying that as faulting older zombie movies. I love them a whole lot as well. But Train to Busan zombies feel very menacing and infected. What do I mean by infected? Well it's the desire of the virus to just spread and propagate. It meerely compells victims to infect others instead of making them waste time unnecessarily by eating them. They only contract and move on to the next terrified witness. It just feels pretty realistic to be entirely honest. Just makes it seem like a next step that rabbies decided to take in evolution, so it just developed it's new dreadful properties. The characters are great as well. Most obviously our main characters, but also the other 10 or so this movie doesn't really struggle to juggle. Also there's a lot of great societal commentare scattered throughout. Recommended!!!",Train to Busan

Some of them are great with mind-blowing action, CGI, stories and characters. Most of them revolves around a main character who comes in to save the day or teams up with characters who are used to further the story of the MC. To my relief, Train to Busan was nothing like that. This movie is about survival. This movie portrays what people are willing to do to save their loved ones when a crisis breaks out- a very shocking, unexpected and terrifying crisis. How the worst in people and also the best is exposed when people need to survive. It's not the most perfect movie. There are flaws and plot holes but you can easily overlook them with the excellent directing and acting. The director did an excellent job on expressing the intensity and the grim atmosphere for the story to fully grapple us. lastly, Hollywood movies could learn a thing or two on how to represent emotional, human side of the movie in a masterful way.",Train to Busan

452,melis-aleyna,Great movie,9,23 September 2018,"There was not one minute I didn't enjoyed watching this movie. The writers did not waste a second on this. From beginning to ending the plot was very well packed with climax after climax.The movie started off a bit clichè with a single divorced parent and a daughter he cannot spend enough time with because of his work and busy schedule. It's a very good plot to see their relationship develop through the movie though. Which by the way was a success.The important part of this movie which makes it so unique is the fact that this movie does not, ironically, focus on the zombies. Their origin, cure, strength is not the main focus and will not be explained. What the movie actually represents (and this is my own interpretation) is the interaction within a group of people (representing a society). This movie shows how people react to a 'threat' emotionally, morally and by action. Zombies are just supposed to represent a threat in this movie but still be a tool to make it an action-packed horror movie on the way.Most of the movie take place in a train and creates an original and claustrophobic atmosphere for a zombie movie. The story was pretty close to a real life experience with no really weapons involved or ordinary humans who turn out to know everything about the zombies and fight them as if it was originally their job. Their were a few minor things in the movie that didn't seem to make much sense though.The main character was not that likable in the beginning. Towards the end he started to grow on me. His daughter, thank god, did not turn out to be a clingy annoying daughter. She was suspiciously calm during the whole process of surviving. The husband of the pregnant women was probably my favorit character as for the baseball boy who was quite likable as well. Very colorful characters. The villain a little exaggerated in my opinion but acceptable if you think about the fact that he is supposed to represent the ignorant part of todays society.I spent two hours on a great zombie movie and would recommend it to everybody.",Train to Busan
453,JordanMccPhoto,Visual storytelling at its best.,10,4 May 2019,"Train to Busan is proof that with effective visual storytelling, you don't need exposition. I watched this movie in Japanese with Japanese subtitles, and despite my Japanese being just ""Ok"" I was able to understand everything the movie was trying to convey. Sometimes simple is best.The film starts off with a protagonist who comes across as selfish and unlikeable, but slowly becomes the hero as the story progresses. However Train to Busan manages to do this without shoving it down the viewer's throat. None of the characters seem like important people with special knowledge, they're all just normal people in a bad situation trying to survive.The choice to confine the story on a train, for the most part, helps the viewer feel a sense of claustrophobia throughout the film and it makes every action the characters make a little more nail biting.While Train to Busan may not be the most original idea, it proves not everything has to be. When done well, even the oldest stories can still make a viewer feel fear, tension, and apprehension for 2 hours.",Train to Busan
454,libby-75255,A zombie movie made me cry?,10,16 October 2020,"This movie is beyond incredible. As someone who hates zombie movies I went into this expecting a few cool action scenes and nothing more. But boy was I shocked and amazed by what I saw.This movie is the only zombie movie I've ever seen that actually brought me to tears more than once.The characters feel so real and their reactions are the cornerstone of this picture. The characters do not react in your typical ""cool action movie"" way, blowing zombies away at every turn. No, they are afraid, they are confused, they are selfish, they are human. They react in the way real people would react in this kind of situation. Some step up and go after zombies, some stay behind in fear for their lives, and some are putting others in danger to save their own skin. The reactions and characters are so diverse and I'm sure if I went in depth, each one could easily represent an aspect of human nature in survival situations.The setting is perfect and the things that happen are as realistic as a zombie movie can get. A huge moving train packed with zombies, no way to communicate with law enforcement, and no way to see what's happening in the outside world other than the TV. The only thing they can do, is survive until the train stops. This mix of danger and being left in the dark creates tension that leaves you on the edge of your seat, biting your nails, praying for the characters safety.Speaking of the character safety, in this movie, no one is safe. I won't go in depth with the more gruesome moments, but rest assured, nothing is off limits. You truly get the sense that anything could happen to these people at any time.The emotional parts of this movie are also an enormous strength. Since the characters all feel so real and so thought out, whenever one dies it feels like a stab in the heart. Even when an extra dies, the acting is so well done that instead of the typical ""there goes another one"" feeling typical of zombie movies you get a feeling of dread, that's constantly encroaching upon everyone involved.All in all, this movie is a perfect example of what a zombie movie can truly be, instead of the same action star schlock usually made. I encourage everyone to watch it at least once, to experience one of the best movies of all time.",Train to Busan

458,forpeen,The movie is realistically a 5.5,3,11 September 2020,"As a Korean or Asian zombie movie, I get it that it is a rare production done relative well. But in a larger scheme of things and comparing with all the zombie movies that have been done to death especially in Hollywood, this movie is AVERAGE. The zombies are unoriginal and so similar to World War Z, this might as well be a called World War Z: The Busan Contagion.That Korean cinema touch of inserting emo moments to every genre is just so cliche, worn out and in this case applied without much thoughts. Going through the day chased by flesh-eating zombies, your body is so flooded with stress and adrenaline, tears of sadness are the last thing that will flow out from you. And let's not get into the many many unrealistic and even unintentionally comical scenes.Movies above 7 in IMDB is usually worth a watch. This is not one of them. Those who rated this 10, please do yourselves a favour and watch more movies outside of Asia.",Train to Busan
459,TheSwedishJFK,This film will make you sweat,8,3 February 2021,"I thought I was bored and done with zombie films. Maybe not for all time, but for the foreseeable future. That was before I stumbled upon Train to Busan.
In this south Korean film from 2017 we follow a young father with a boring suit that has lost the spark for life. He boarders a train with his estranged daughter. During the start of the movie, we have these pretty common clues about animals and people staring to act weird. In many ways Train to Busan follows the zombie film playbook. But I think it goes furthers with creating very heartfelt stories. One of the biggest possibilities there is with the genre is too elaborate with the characters relationships to each other and especially to themselves in a time of horror.
They succeed in this area many times, not just with the dad and daughter who are perfectly portrayed. We have this young baseball player and his girlfriend as the cute couple. Then there is a pregnant couple who works as the comic relief when together. But the man in this couple is very skeptical about our protagonist father whereas the woman is bonding with the daughter. The chemistry is priceless between these characters and it makes the whole movie. At the same time, it is one of the better action movies in a long time and the suspense is world class. I was sweating almost the whole movie.",Train to Busan
460,t-hunt910,Well worth seeking out this South Korean Zombie epic.,8,14 January 2019,"Train to Busan makes most zombie film look pedestrian in comparison. While you average zombie film moves along like a car stuck on the M25, this movie moves along like a Porsche on high-speed racetrack.
The director throws every thing at the movie including the kitchen sink. Like all great movies you really care about the characters, which makes the hyperactive, never let up ending almost unbearable to watch.
Its 2 half hour running time allows the script to include every plot device seen in most recent zombie movies. But most importantly it never drags. Its claustrophobic setting allows the director to pull off some unique moments of crisis. Also GCI and stunt team do a very good job here.
Highly recommended not just by me but by the director of Sean of the dead no less, how can you go wrong.",Train to Busan

To me this has topped Shaun of the dead, Night of the living dead, Day of the dead(1986) and Dawn of the Dead remake.I just rewatched it for the the first time in 5 years since I first saw it on Netflix US(now on Amazon and Shudder). The claustrophobia and emotion is still amazing and recommend to watch if you love zombies and action pack films that waste no time kicking off the plot.The sequel wasn't great but wasnt bad but there no way it would be on par of this film and neither that of the animated prequel.

The zombies themselves are freaky and horrible, they move as you would expect them to, falling from ledges, running carelessly at potential victims, slamming into walls as if they have no self-awareness unlike other movies where they act somewhat intelligent as they negotiate the terrain. There are some really tense moments in it and really cool scenes. If you love zombie movies this should be definitely be on your to watch list.",Train to Busan

Though the characters all had a little bit of depth, and the setting of a train was fun, the movie did just boil down to a zombie flick: 1 dimensional characters that do everything you expect (greedy COO, all-sacrificing masc-dad, hopelessly in love teenage boy, matronly and caring pregnant mom), tons of impossible to escape scenes, and death of nearly everyone except for a chosen city of people. The relationship between the father and his daughter was the most interesting, seeing his lack of empathy and the ideas he was teaching her about selfishness flipped on their head when disaster struck made for a nice (albeit cliche) arc, but other than that the film was just ok.",Train to Busan

The casting is awesome, everyone has done the best job and correctly understood the character, especially the little girl has done fabulous work , having all expressions to the point. The makeup artists are also an important part in its success giving a real look of zombies.
The movie is not perfect as must I say because at some points the actions and decisions taken by the characters will really piss you off.

The whole premise of a zombie apocalypse has obviously been done a million times over, but the execution, the concept, the characters got me really invested. The acting could've improved a little, although, it is hard to judge completely since it is in Korean making it hard to hear the nuances of emotions being portrayed.

It really connects with each character of the story and also teaches high moral lessons in the time of dire consequences. It clearly shows each characters mindset and how they react to the situation. The protagonist's (Father-Daughter)story is very emotional and touches all the right chords of feelings.

477,HumanLifeMovie,Investigate humanities ego-tripping psyche in a zombie movie,9,9 September 2017,"I believe this is the best zombie film I've seen so far. It is not overdone, like so many of the big screen zombie films are. There is some kind of outbreak at a facility and people are evacuated. During the outbreak day a girl is going to visit her mother in another place. To reach the destination she has to take the train to Busan. This trip turns out differently than expected. During their trip there is a outbreak of a zombie sickness. People simply turn into zombies and try to eat non infected people. This outbreak also happens on the train. How will they handle it? Is there any way to survive this train trip and reach the destination? There is a lot of blood and splatter and if you are a sensitive person this is not a film for you. But if you adore zombie movies, this is one of the better ones. It is not overcooked, no this production is just right. It is enough of everything. Somehow this movie also investigates how far you are willing to go for your self interests. Are you willing to help other's on your way? Or are you ego, just doing what benefits you, even if that means other people dying? Somehow this is about how we people turn on each other in crises. So who are you, the good samaritan or the self-centered asshole? Well, I guess Train to Busan just puts all these things on display. You might even learn something about humanity watching this zombie movie. Interesting right? It's well worth seeing this movie. Sit down, be on the edge for a while. The grade is a grade set where I compare it with other zombie movies.",Train to Busan

Won't be disappointed,9,22 January 2021,"I'm always skeptical going into new zombie movies Bc good ones just are made anymore most are B rated and the filming sucks. THIS MOVIE IS GREAT. Hollywood needs to take some tips for these people. They stayed within realm of what we know while introducing their own spin on certain zombie traits. Its has that edge of the seat, hold your breathe type scenes. It's got characters you can like and ones your screaming to kill already. Adding that it's on a train gives it a more be careful, watch where you go factor. I didn't quite catch how it started I'll have to rewatch to see if I missed something. For me it's a sold 9.5, one of my new favorites on up there with dawn of the dead (04), and this is just a me thing but it lost .5 Bc I wasn't as happy with the ending as I wanted to be but they brought it together wonderfully and respect their writing.

The worse of all is that the acting of the actors: main as well as supporting actors: they are not real enough and their emotions are forceful...i feel like they are all amateur....I have never seen a zombie in my life but i think the zombies in this film run too fast and very coordinated when they jump or chasing after people, it means when necessary to run after the uninfected ones. But when the uninfected ones fell, well, the zombies started to walk clumsily and slowly toward the fallen....like they knew their preys could not run so they, the zombies, do the ""zombie walk"" just to impress them !!!

At first you'd wonder how a movie with zombies on a train could span 2 hours, but this film did it outstandingly well! I could easily have watched it going on for another hour.The scenarios are realistic (well as realistic at can be for there being zombies 🙂).The film also presented a theme of man's inhumanity to man on one side, and the selflessness of man for his brother on the other side - all in the midst of a life and death struggle. This was set up very well early on.It was interesting to observe the evolution of the main character as things progressed.It may not be to everyone's taste, it's not as gore-filled as some other films (though there is carnage a-plenty).Overall, I trilling film.",Train to Busan

For the audiences that love to 'cut an onion', the family and humanity scenes had touch my heart even my tears didn't fall down. The duration is around 2 hours and I didn't even feel it was already 2 hours after I watched it.I felt so entertained until I make a big hole of my mouth in the hall and luckily, the hall was too dark and I was sitting far from anybody – I sat in the COUPLE SEAT, alone. Maybe I easily felt entertained with this movie because of the less information I got before watching the movie. I knew the movie had viral long ago and I even knew it was about zombies two or three days before I went to the cinema. I also never watched the trailer. So it gave me a different experience of entertainment while watching it with less information of (it would be the same to another movies).

All the exciting moments end with a climax that's fit for a movie. The few minutes during each break for audience to catch their breath is not boring or wasted, perfectly used for characters development.

Firstly pretty much all of it is filmed in broad daylight so you can see what is going on. Secondly it's pacey without going completely over the top in the action scenes. Thirdly there is characterisation and not just gore. You care about these people and want them to live. Fourthly it is quite well acted (the little girl is fantastically good and will break your heart) and very well directed. Yes it is a bit silly and overlong and is more of an action adventure film than a horror. The infected have not died so are not really zombies and there is none of that ""let's see how many ways we can destroy their brains"" which seems to be the only raison d'etre of most zombie movies.

Every performance was on point! You could just see the fear portrayed in detail on everyones faces. Even the extras! Every dialogue flowed naturally and realistically. The zombies physical movements and make up were so believable and executed well! All of this only added to the fear and panic instilled on viewers and portrayed to perfection by all the characters on screen. It was brilliant writing-wise, the way every character had such diverse characters with different perspectives, arcs, motivations, and belief systems all intertwined and played out like a domino effect.

Yet TTB takes that a step further by building on the idea that, even in our darkest days, we need to look out for each other, and it is those who climb over the weak to save themselves who will suffer. Performances are outstanding all around, especially from the young Kim Su-an who incredibly makes every nightmarish scene seem utterly real.",Train to Busan
509,beanbiin,Train to Busan resembles with Snowpiercer in which both film main setting was on the train but twisted with Zombie Apocalyptic Plot.,7,30 October 2016,"Before Train to Busan became popular when it reaches big screen across the globe, I thought It will have a resemblance with Snowpiercer a film which was also directed by a Korean director, Bong Jon Hoo. What's differ with this Train to Busan film is, it is purely Korean made from director to language and it became popular over the social media because of the uniqueness of the Title.Train to Busan resembles with Snowpiercer in which both film main setting was on the train but twisted with Zombie Apocalyptic Plot. However, just like previous zombie horror sci-fi film, there's nothing special with the zombies in Train to Busan from how it was spread and how zombies reacts with uninfected ones. I loved how the train gives major role in the film however, despite they are inside the train, the story is something that so usual among zombie horror film. One bad point is, they are always in a group; a group with different personality and objectives which for me is platitude to give a thrilling rising in action. Story is not that unique, cliché, plot holes and impossible scenes are present in the whole duration of the film. It's the same as usual zombie apocalypse with no major changes of plot. Train to Busan is definitely a simple Zombie Horror Film that do not gives adrenaline satisfaction of it's common and bad story line. But still a must watch movie for Zombie Lovers.",Train to Busan

Ah, I just read that Seoul Station is an animated film, and I am not big on those either. But, I'll have to find it and watch it now. And now I want to rewatch 'Snowpiercer' and '28 Days Later'.

First off, the characters are colorful, yet easy to relate to. I would say the supporting characters are some of the best and well written characters I've seen in a horror genre...ever. I was pleased to see there was a lot of attention to detail on each and every character. The location is unique (98% of the film is shot on a moving train) and it really adds to the high stakes, fast paced, high stress environment. I thought they did a great job creating a space and environment that really added to the story in many layers.

When I watched the trailer for Train to Busan, I knew I had to see it in a theater. The day it came out in the U. S., I drove 20 minutes to the only theater showing Train to Busan. I was not disappointed at all. The theater was packed. Train to Busan kept me literally on the edge of my seat. I found myself on an emotional roller coaster ride while watching this perfectly executed action packed zombie movie. I was so invested because the characters were so well developed. (Make sure to have tissue handy when watching this movie because I was not the only one crying during the movie, I could hear sniffling all around me in the theater.) I recommended this movie to my cousin who also loves zombie movies. She was hesitant about driving half an hour to see it but I convinced her to go. I got a big thank you text from her after they left the theater. She said it was well worth the drive. I have since watched this several times at home and I still cry but I just love this movie!If you are into zombie movies, you MUST watch this. If I had to rank my top 3 favorite zombie movies with 1 being the highest/best, they would be as follows.#1 Train to Busan
#2 Zack Snyder's Dawn of the Dead
#3 28 Days LaterThis is the only foreign film that I've watched in a theater as of today. Note that I always find fault in almost every movie I watch. I could not find anything wrong with this movie. I was, however, very sad that a character was killed off to the point of crying like a leaky faucet. And even so, I still can't say that it should've ended differently.",Train to Busan
521,wcoleparks,Great movie up to the last 30 minutes,7,21 June 2016,"With such a high presence in both TV and film, zombies are becoming over used. Our fascination with them seems to quickly be coming to a close, so it takes something special to stand out. First time live action director, Sang-ho Yeon, has managed to craft a unique take on the undead by placing them on a train and adding a few things to their mythology. Despite underdeveloped characters and an overly sentimental final act, Train to Busan delivers a fresh take on the zombie movement that contains some extremely memorable set pieces. The story revolves around a father who is taking his daughter to see his ex-wife. Yoo Gong plays the typical father who is more concerned with work than with family and does not always put people as his top priority. His daughter is the typical kid who knows how important other people are and always tries to do the right thing. This is where the film really falters. The characters fit perfectly into stereotypical roles and never feel like anything other than placeholders. There is the typical villain who never seems to die, the typical female characters who must rely on the men, and the group of people who blindly follow orders. There is one excretion however. During the train ride, the father and daughter encounter a couple with a child on the way. The man in this relationship is charismatic, charming, and above all, badass. When everything is about to go down, he is quick to suit up and prepare for a fight. This is the one character in the entire film that stands out and quickly becomes the reason you root for the characters to make it out. There is also an incredibly emotional scene involving this character that really hits hard. The build up to the scene works well and because we are so attached to him, anytime he is at risk the stakes are raised. The scene is effective and almost brought tears to my eyes. This scene should have been the emotional climax of the film. Unfortunately the film goes on for about 30 more minutes and involves another emotional moment with the main character. This second scene however is not effective at all. Through flashbacks and an awkward script, the scene becomes cheesy and at a certain point comical. It didn't work and really took away from the previous emotional climax. Typical of the zombie genre, the film does contain a social critique. Similar to Snowpiercer, the film uses its setting to comment on the class system and the social order we fall into. The businessman is ultimately the boss as he is superior in pedigree and it is up to everyone else to follow him or be cast aside. Additionally his character perfectly aligns with the dog eat dog world we live in today as he uses others for his own advantage. As he throws people to the wayside, literally to be devoured by those around them, it is clear the point that is being made. Also borrowing from another film, the zombies here are fast. Just like in World War Z, they act like swarms of insects as they barrel through doorways and windows creating a sense of urgency slower zombies often fail to establish. They also look great. There are a few moments when they all swarm together, where it is clear CGI was used, but for the most part they used practical effects. The zombies move with disjointed, quick movements that make them very terrifying. It is almost painful to watch them contort their bodies as they converge on their victims. The real unique characteristic though is that they cannot see well in the dark. This trait provides the basis for a number of intense set pieces as characters use sounds to mislead the zombies and navigate the claustrophobic setting from train car to train car. Another great set piece involves the characters getting off the train. It appears as though they have reached a safe zone, but once they realize that they are mistaken, it becomes a race to get back on the train. Characters are killed, people are injured, and bonds are formed as people realize how much they need each other to survive. It is a nice diversion from what we have seen so far and gives the audience something different, yet equally intense, so the action doesn't get repetitive. In the end however, the film does fail to keep us engaged. In the last 30 minutes, the film really starts to drag. The action is not as effective and then builds up to the disappointing emotional climax mentioned earlier. At this point, I just wanted our characters to reach safety, or die already. The very last scene however does work well. In a film filled with brutal action, it was nice to end on a heart-warming moment.Train to Busan (2016) Directed by: Sang-ho Yeon Screenplay by: Sang-ho Yeon Starring: Yoo Gong, Dong-seok Ma, and Woo-sik Choi Run Time: 1 hour 58 minutes",Train to Busan

529,simonemmanuelschouten,"Overrated movie, even for zombie-standards",3,21 December 2016,"##No specific spoilers here, but this *is* a zombie movie.##That should be a dead give-away that: The fighting scenes will be be weak and nonsensical, mostly involving lots of people getting bitten for no good reason. (They are.) - The characters are completely retarded and suicidal. (They are.) - The whole zombie deal is going to be left without proper explanation and for every bit of plot, we'll be getting 2 giant plot-holes. (It is, and we do.)I actually started watching the movie with these as my only expectations, hoping to get some cheap entertainment. But Train to Busan fully lived up to these negative expectations, and then proceeded to add to them by taking itself way too serious. In addition to the above we get:Serious, pathetic attempts at character development. (along the lines of ""I used to be a jerk but not anymore because zombies."") - Horrible social commentary. (Oh really, we should help each other, not be complete egocentric bastards? Wow thanks movie, I'd never thought of that...) - Dull dramatic scenes. (Loooong, cliché, and really only serve to get some extremely flat characters who basically have only *one* defining characteristic, who we're then supposed to be emotionally attached to.) - 4 points where the movie should have just ended. (Honestly, I'd given it a 4 or a 5 even, if it had just ended after the first 45 minutes. But it keeps dragging on and on, only ever getting more boring.) - Lack-luster fighting scenes. (Mostly just people getting bitten without doing *anything* back, because... zombies. ""Oh will you look at that? A blood-covered man with ripped clothes and white eyes is sprinting towards me growling loudly and flailing his arms. Should I at least raise my arms maybe? Naw, I'll just stand here and do absolutely nothing."")I stopped watching it 3 times, and tried finishing it 2 times, but after last time I was done. I've seen like 80% and I really don't care for the ending; it's just not enjoyable in the slightest, nor is it 'deep' or in any other way worth watching.

530,darthgeekhi,An emotionally hard hitting film that isn't just about the zombies,8,29 October 2021,"Train to Busan works most effectively when building up the advent of a zombie apocalypse through unsettling images; a deer we watch get hit by a vehicle rises back up, bones cracking and wounds fresh; a line of ambulances rush past our protagonist father and his daughter on their way to the train station, the latter catching floating soot coming from a burning building in the distance; out of the window of the titular train we watch alongside the daughter a station worker get aggressively tackled for a split second without a sound.On a meta level, the viewers have been explicitly told that there's some sort of zombie invasion coming just from the deer scene alone, so it serves as a great irony as our lead characters catch fleeting glimpses of the chaos going on in the outside world from inside their cars and trains, already consumed with their own issues and destinations. The prior mentioned father and daughter want to travel to Busan in an attempt to see the mother, a couple on the train have a baby on the way. At the end of the day, they wish to see loved ones but instead are faced with zombies (who, ironically enough, wish to see the humans themselves I suppose).And it's in these human struggles where I believe the core of the film lies. Believable, charismatic performances carry the heft of zombie attacks and fights (not to discredit these scenes, they're very well directed and shot). People with everyday problems unite (or segregate) in an attempt to survive. Life-saving moves had me shouting in glee while selfish, fear-mongering moves had me frustrated. The performance by Kim Su-an, the daughter, was precious and innocent; her father played by Gong Yoo felt appropriately cold and distant until he had to rise to the occasion. Both of these characters and performances culminate in a climax that brought me to tears (I've honestly never done so for a zombie film).The zombie element captured my attention from the beginning, and the human element is what makes this movie truly work, but the genius of Train to Busan is in how it intertwines these aspects in both structure and concept.",Train to Busan

The behavior of the characters is so odd and unbelievable I couldn't suspend my disbelief. I'll give you some examples.1) The young daughter of the main character walks into a small train cabin to use the bathroom while train employees are dealing w/ a clearly deranged and potentially dangerous man in that very bathroom. Instead of telling her to leave they just let her stand...LITERALLY RIGHT IN FRONT OF HIM, while this man mumbles about how everyone's going to die. First red flag.2) When the zombies start attacking most people seem to just stand around like idiots waiting for their death. It was actually kinda funny to see...3) The main character gets a call from his mother and instead of immediately asking how she is and telling her to barricade the door, he just has a chat w/ her until he realizes she's already been bitten.

554,penguoxo,Not a typical zombie movie,9,9 January 2020,"Wow, this movie is incredibly intense emotionally. The characters are all designed very well, so even if they seem like bad people at times or have done something wrong, you still are rooting for them because they have learned from their wrongs and are obviously being affected by them (except for one guy). It was surprising how real some of the movie felt, in terms of it not being the typical movie where everything predictably just barely goes perfectly for the main characters. This movie didn't sacrifice realism for plot convenience as much as some other movies which made it very tense and gripping. That said, there definitely were some times that they used plot convenience to set up to play with the audience's emotions, but it wasn't overdone. At times, the acting was kind of off, but I tried thinking about how they should have acted in those situations instead and couldn't think of how to execute what needed to be done. Some of the situations were just way too intense emotionally to really even know how someone would actually react in them. I enjoyed the music and camerawork as they both added to the movie quite a bit. I don't have much negative to say about this film, it was really well done and way better and more thought provoking than I anticipated.As for symbolism, themes, morals, etc., I didn't expect a zombie movie to be very deep, but Train to Busan really does force you to consider things. The main theme is finding a balance between sacrificing your own best interest for the good of others and putting yourself first. When should you ignore others in need to save yourself? Should you ever? How much of yourself should you sacrifice to help others? These questions are constantly addressed throughout the movie. The entire zombie outbreak was started because of negligence of the well being of others. There is a conflict between the father and his daughter in the beginning that is caused by him not being there in her life because he is always busy with work. His work has even caused his wife to leave him. He was obviously doing it all for his daughter's future, but when is the sacrifice too much and how should it be balanced properly? He learns early on that his daughter thinks of others a lot and does what she can for them, whereas he thinks only of himself a lot of the time which she notices and dislikes. As the story goes on, you can see a noticeable change in his actions as he becomes more and more giving until eventually he has to make the ultimate sacrifice to save his daughter. Along the way, some of his actions have almost instant karma where he will decide to risk helping someone and then they end up saving him soon after or he doesn't take the risk and it causes some sort of conflict for him. There are many characters who made great sacrifices for others and I think he saw that and always took note and saw the result of the sacrifice which helped him change and do the same. There is also a character who is entirely greedy and even sacrifices other for himself and although he does make it pretty far, he ends up infected which is very telling of where that route will get you.All in all, I believe that Train to Busan is a great film all around and is entirely worth watching, whether you want an emotional, gripping, or thought provoking experience.",Train to Busan

The suspense and thrill also keep you on the edge. BUT and this is a really big but, how the characters take decision here is what infuriated me the most. They are - to put it nicely - UTTERLY STUPID.The story started nice and sound. All good until zombie arrived and suddenly all characters decided to be the stupidest person in the world. Yes, I know zombie and any other life-threathening situation will clouding your judgment. But in this movie, it's just unbelievable idiot. I lose interest through the end of the movie but keep watching (though with high blood pressure).Yes, yes there are touching dramas here and there but the drama doesn't need to occurred IF the stupid decision was not taken at the very first place. I want to list them here but there are so many. I just can't.",Train to Busan
559,christopherdegrazia,Very much like black summer but lacking one thing,8,15 April 2019,I absolutely loved this movie and surprisingly didnt mind watching it from another language. Normally I hate movies from other languages. The plot seemed extremely good but am pretty upset they killed all the actors at the end of it besides the kid and wife (of the cool dude) of course. Would absolutely watch the next one if it comes out. Overall awesome movie they were just missing a few things and the story line could of been a bit better and not just be in a train the entire time.,Train to Busan

He will terrify you and then make you cry hysterically. There are very few films that can move you in such a way. Train to Busan is one of those films. Oddly enough, I watched Psychokinesis after skipping over it on my streaming service for months. I'd run out of options for good science fiction so I buckled and tried it out. What a fool I was for misjudging that movie. It was so incredible that I had to see more of Sang-ho's work. I had heard incredible things of Train to Busan but, similarly to my preconceived ideas of Psychokinesis, I had my doubts of how a zombie film could be... well anything but a zombie film. Boy was I happily wrong. Much to my surprise, this film was not average in the least bit whatsoever. How dare I call myself a film lover if I've never seen Train to Busan? It moved me to a place I was not ready to go to but I am glad I went. This movie is epic, horrifying, and brilliant- An utter masterpiece.",Train to Busan

570,Jimmy_Jack_,A new spin encountering Zombies,8,19 June 2020,"Between The Walking Dead & every Zombie film under the sun, Train to Busan isn't overtly cliché. It does start slow, but for good reason. The suttle build up was a great idea because of the tense & life threatening moments are at every turn for most of the film. Besides the outside world, being safe or trapped on this train made made it a new situation facing a zombie outbreak that was done very well. It's fun to watch.",Train to Busan
571,steamboatwillie1928,Surprisingly Great,9,27 March 2017,"I have to say that we generally avoid movies with sub-titles and Asian films. We want to watch the movie, not read the sub-titles and most Asian films do not make sense to me because of the cultural differences. Train to Busan had both these as strikes against it, yet for some reason, we decided to give it a shot, fully expecting to hate it and have another selection going in short time. Boy were we wrong!! About fifteen minutes into the movie, the main characters had been introduced, the stage set and the roller-coaster started heading down the first hill. And a roller-coaster ride it was. We were on the edge of our seats: anxious, happy, sad, shocked, the full gamut of emotions.This is a zombie film, but it is an intelligent zombie film. The director does not resort to cheap gags and scenes that all of the zombie films now-a-days fall prey to. In many respects, it reminded me of World War Z and very well could have occurred in the same universe.Sang-ho Yeon, who also wrote the screenplay, did an amazing job with direction. He gave the film depth and subtle levels.Yoo Gong and Soo-an Kim, who play the father and daughter respectively, were so believable in their roles. The majority of the cast deserve praise for their work: you hate who you should hate, you like who you should like you change opinions about the ones you should change your minds about. But it does go beyond the simple classification of ""good guys"" and ""bad guys"".Whether you like zombie movies or just a good ""who lives, who dies"" film, give this little gem a shot. You will be surprised.",Train to Busan

It had drama, GREAT ZOMBIES (fast, strong/crazy and jumping and all over the place) it had a realistic progression on the train and through out the movie, You had your villain/extra afraid/ahole in the group of survivors, your family groups and your lovers groups, and you feel emotion several times in this movieBack to the villain I watch horror, slasher and action/drama/hero movies and I can honestly say THIS villain made me want to jump through the TV and beat his A-again it takes you through a lot of emotionsthe pace of the movies is quick, we know in the first 3 mins of the film it's a ZOMBIE move, and in the next 12 mins the full action starts and DOES NOT STOPFrankly having this happen in a cramped train with limited options (yet the movies still giving you lots of surprises) was excellent.Really really great movie one of the few I've bought online instead of renting.

I was not really thrilled and got bored after first hour. Watchable with pop corn ,friends and laughs if your expectations are low. Obviously overrated and a B-Movie .",Train to Busan
576,MargotMan,"Decent zombie flick. Fresh, but not spectacular. Worth a watch.",7,11 July 2017,"I thought this was a pretty decent zombie flick. The pacing was good, but this is an action film more than a horror film. This was more World War Z than Night of the Living Dead. Some of the scenes were a bit of a stretch of the imagination, but it is a zombie film, not a biopic. There were quite a bit of ""feels"" which is usually hard to accomplish in a zombie film, and it actually felt pretty fresh without completely rewriting the genre. The movie effectively made you like some characters, love some characters, hate some characters, you get the point.Something that bothers me about zombie movies is the inconsistency of the zombie mechanics. How fast and strong a zombie is, how fast people turn, etc. This movie is pretty notorious for this. One minute, people take what seems to be up to 15 minutes plus to turn, then next minute people are turning immediately. Zombies are jumping over objects and mangling a group of people, and then in the next scene one man can hold back an entire zombie hoard by himself without a scratch. It definitely pulls you away from the story for a moment. Overall though, this was a decent film, and I had fun watching it. In the end, this is an action/horror film that should be treated as such. Don't expect everything to make perfect sense and don't expect stellar dialog and acting, although the acting is very decent for an action/horror film.",Train to Busan
577,doug-pittman-007,"Great story, characters, cast, and zombies!",9,16 October 2021,This movie had great story and character development that kept moving with the train.

Definitely worth watching!,Train to Busan
578,CoderHead,Korean Zombies Done Right,7,30 April 2019,"I've seen this film mentioned elsewhere and saw it come up in my Netflix recommendations a few times so I thought I'd give it a try - especially since the user rating is impressive for Netflix and it was nominated for and won some awards.In essence, it's a fairly typical zombie horror flick but the emphasis is a complex family dynamic and mental struggle of survivors on the train from Seoul to Busan. Nobody suddenly becomes a ninja warrior or a military arms expert and not everyone lives to the end of the movie. I think that differentiates it from standard Hollywood zombie fare and makes it more compelling in the end.The acting is pretty solid and the special effects are (even though sometimes comical) surprisingly high-quality. Even though zombies are kind of played out at this point I'd recommend giving this one a lazy, rainy day viewing.",Train to Busan
579,Internetghost,Not Worthy of the Hype,4,20 August 2020,"Maybe it's because of the excessive hype surrounding this supposedly groundbreaking zombie film but I was disappointed with this. This film feels like an unofficial World War Z remake in South Korea and not in a good way. There's really nothing in this film that separates it from others of its kind. It may be South Korean but it definitely feels like a typical Hollywood blockbuster.First big problem with the film are the unearned attempts at drama and tears. It's extremely melodramatic with too many attempts to touch your emotions and pull at the heartstrings, and it doesn't work because these characters are flat and disposable. They barely get any character development and are mostly just stock characters: the corrupt capitalist businessman, the dumb teenagers, the annoying kid, the hobo who speaks about the end of days, the damsel in distress, and the everyday man. They're the most one dimensional horror characters on the face of the earth who only exist to fight zombies and get eaten. I think it also says a lot that many of the positive reviews here only praise the cheerleader for being hot and not because she's a compelling character.Plus I found the ""don't be selfish"" aesop to be forced and poorly executed. It'd be one thing if the lead character had to learn over the course of the entire film to be more selfless and help other people as part of his path to become a better person but no, that little character arc is dropped in an instant. instead we get a hate sink character in the businessman who's presence beats us over the head with how selfishness is wrong by having him do increasingly despicable things just for the sake of it. He's not a character, just a token attempt at inserting forced and contrived conflict into the story.How to fix this? Cut down on the melodrama and remove the corrupt corporate executive and tramp characters. They're both annoying cliches (the homeless and filthy looking freak speaking about the end of days and the apocalypse has been done to death). Let the zombies be the villains for once in these movies instead of using that dumb ""maybe humans are the real monsters"" cliche.",Train to Busan

Smart, well written characters you actually want to survive because they don't act like blow up dolls with jello for brains. The most annoying part of any horror movie is the main characters responding to situations in moronic ways that no normal person would ever respond. No doubt Hollywood will soon remake it and lose everything that makes this movie believable/awesome. Regardless, this is a GREAT movie. This is an OUTSTANDING zombie movie.

It then dissolves into a wonderful outbreak occurring, very well done. But then it begins to try make you care about characters that are just bad at acting... the main actor is dreadful. You literally won't feel any care at all for him, or the little girl that non stop complains. As you'd expect a film like this needs the also have a pregnant women so you feel some tension, and while this is quite stereotypical, she was one of the better actors in the film. The story is just abysmal, and the main character doesn't help at all. A stereotypical business man must get his kid to safety. But get ready for multiple references to how horrible he is. The whole plot has a nice general idea ruined by stupid situations where you'll find yourself saying ""really?"" A lot. SPOILERS: Also, if you've watched it... how did they expect to ""verify"" anything walking through the tunnel when it's ""too dark""??? Looks like they'll be shooting everyone on sight.

It has everything from action and horror to heartfelt, slightly over the top k-drama music that highlights perfectly the plot. Believe it or not, there is also humor, amazing special effects and, the cherry on the top, the little girl's performance. However, expect stupid things to happen, like people forgetting how to run, people being extra-loud, people not checking minor details like looking behind them, etc. But maybe that's too be expected in a dangerous, totally new situation? 
As a bonus, you MIGHT enjoy the lack of brain smashing scenes, brain goo, heads exploding like pumpkins, etc. so feel free to enjoy plenty of snacks while watching this zombie flick.

Matter of fact, last 15 minutes or so is where it really got stupid. They should have just ended it with more of the group surviving. So, if you don't mind stupid endings then you will like this. But if it pisses you off when they kill people off for no reason other than some schmo decided it would be cool then pass.

Like most such films, this one avoids the classic but little-used-now voodoo or necromancy explanation for the reanimation of the dead, but unlike most others it does give an explanation for the phenomenon. This could have taken up half the film and weighed it down considerably, but the writers introduce it through a few deft touches which both explain what is happening and fuel the tragic plot. The cast does a good job (from what I can tell without knowing Korean), and both the action sequences and quieter moments are engaging.Horror fans will mostly like this, but it should appeal to others too, since its central characters and their predicament have universal resonance.",Train to Busan

I was eating a sandwich at the beginning of the movie but as it progressed I got so engaged that I forgot to eat it. Get ready for an action packed thriller. We've all watched Hollywood zombie movies but this movie just takes it to another level. I myself am not specifically a fan of Korean movies myself but this movie is worth watching. The pacing of the movie was a bit slow in the beginning but as the movie progressed it went from zero to hero real quick. As you watch the movie you bond with different types of characters which in my opinion, all of them represent a specific person in society. Eg. the businessman represents the guy who works a lot, gains a lot of money and thinks he is above all. The husband of the pregnant women; the guy who is always a bit humorous and would sacrifice himself for the sake of others. The father is also the person who works his butt off but is always a bit selfish. But as always he/she realises what he/she has done and regrets his choices in his past. Towards the end of the movie everybody probably smirked at the death of COO of the train company. But also, when the father tried saving his daughter and the pregnant women, he got bit.

Trains are like buses and can be routed on a whim without the need for Signalling or Signalers/dispatchers to control movements.Under a zombie attack railways will still function at 100%, including signalling, the electrical supply to the trains, signals and turnouts.Mobile phone networks will still work and not get overwhelmed, and handset batteries last for hours without chargeOn the modern railway, the car lights go out in tunnels to give protagonists a chanceZombies can be stopped by unlockable sliding doors between cars.Some elder Korean women only look about 35 years old women with wigs onWhen a track is blocked, you can just take any from any yard or track and go where you want regardless of what the signalling dictates.You can easily run and jump onto a runaway loco that's traveling in excess of 20MPH whilst carrying a child and if you're pregnantNever trust the middle aged business executive, he'll just sacrifice everyone else to survive simply to get infected later",Train to Busan

614,brycebclark,It wasn't flawless but still thoroughly enjoyable,7,7 January 2017,"Overall, the plot and development of the story were engaging throughout. There were only a few forgivable occasions when the verisimilitude and consistency of dialogue, characters, and story were waning. To be completely fair, I really enjoyed the suspense kept throughout the entire film. The cinematography and editing captured the chaos of events really well and the deaths were neither predictable nor overdone. In the end, the protagonist reconciles his prior shortcomings and the film ends full circle. My only grief is that I wish they would have saved more characters, allowing each group to find their own way out the train station after the separation (which would have been more realistic) instead of killing everyone immediately and leaving just the daughter and girlfriend as the focal point (which is the standard but so very typical.) I also wish the writers and director would have explored the night-blindness of the monsters in an open urban setting (imagine if you had discovered that these monsters were absolutely blinded in darkness; why would you not have shared this with everyone and made your escape plans to accommodate that huge advantage?) There was huge potential with that, so I am slightly disappointed it wasn't utilized more significantly. But, in total, I think the film managed a 7/10.On a side note, I'm expecting some of these negative reviews are biased against the film for being of Korean origin. Also, the subtitles can suck.",Train to Busan

616,kanyeezy-28832,"Challenge of Korean blockbuster, and it succeeded quite well",7,23 July 2016,"Making zombie blockbuster movies outside of Hollywood is not an easy task. Money is the biggest problem, of course. Since it takes a lot of money, success should be guaranteed before making a movie is decided. However, because there are no other precedents, you can't tell whether it's going to succeed or not. This bad cycle kept Korean directors from making zombie blockbusters. This tells how bold movement it was to make 'Train to Busan'. This movie was destined to be 'hit' or 'flop' and it turns out to be 'hit'. Then, this gives a food for thought. What made this Korean zombie blockbuster movie which is definitely unfamiliar to Korean people successful? Ironically, the secret lies in familiarity. Let's take a look at this movie. Yes, it has zombies, but is this movie all about them? No. Unlike 28 days later or resident evil, this movie actually doesn't care about zombies that much. Zombies are not explained much. Their origin, their ability, cure for zombiesThese are the things that are not being handled well in the movie. In this movie, zombies are just tools to represent 'threats'. The main theme of this movie is about how people react to threats. Selfishness, altruism, violence, love and much more are being depicted in this movie. And Korean people are quite accustomed to these elements. When directors mix these elements well, then the movie becomes a hit, just like this one. However, this movie still has some downsides too. Acting of Jin-hee is quite unbearably bad and the character Yong-suk (who keeps trying to sacrifice others to save himself) had gone way too far. Yes, I can get mad at bad guys but I don't want to get annoyed at them. Also, getting annoyed gets worse when it is not properly resolved as this movie does. Overall, this is a quite well-made movie, though it still has some bad moments. I believe this movie will be a new beginning for Korean blockbusters. And I recommend you to watch this movie to stay alert for rise of Korean movies.",Train to Busan

Realistic but also controls a very confronting zombie-esc story line. Action packed from 10 mins in and never lets go. Heart rate went through the roof and in a good way. Powerful storytelling and for a South Korean film, amazing.

Starts off well, shows us some key actors and engulfs us in the story in an emotional and interesting manner. We have two main leads, the father and the child, and a vast array of secondary actors. The movie is exceptional not because is good but because it has a very twisting line. You may think a favorite character will live but he/she wont. Imagine Game of Thrones, right? They die a lot. Now add zombies, add a high speed moving train, add a yakuza, some teenagers and the cliché ""pregnant lady"". Of course add the drama between parent and child and a WHOLE LOT of blood and gore, with no expense saved on special effects, no double the same zombie ""I CHECKED"".

Stop.I liked this take on zombie lore. It's claustrophobic. It gives enough character development so that it's not just blood and gore.

Furthermore, this movie provides a very good social commentary and portrays class differences quite well, exactly to the smallest detail. Also the inter-human relations between people are really well portrayed and quite realistic.In addition this movie is great due to it being realistic, it does not sugarcoat the ""realities"" of a zombie outbreak, what can, will go bad at the next turn, and only those fortunate or resourceful make it out alive, as would be in real life.TL;DR this is a movie filled with constant action which keeps you on the edge, fantastic acting, a great social commentary, and astounding inter-human relations.",Train to Busan

One of the better zombie films out there.,9,10 June 2019,"Busanhaeng, more commonly known in the west as Train to Busan, focuses primarily on a hard-working man who frequently puts his work before his young daughter. The man, Seok-woo, takes his daughter on an early train headed from Seoul to Busan in order for her to see her mother. What happens when they board the train, well it is quite obvious what happens. Nevertheless, Train to Busan involved a broad range of characters, although they were cliche, that offered an experience of how people reacted to their surroundings and what they were willing to do in order to survive. There is relief and heartbreak along the way, but Train to Busan is certainly the best modern zombie film, and one of the best films I have recently seen.

641,JamieReview,A great zombie movie!,7,20 May 2021,"The prologue is interesting and sets up the story well. Gives us information on what is happening in the area, how it is effecting business and how even animals can become zombies. Due to the information we are told about what had happened in that area, we can already start theorising the cause of what's turning humans and animals into zombies.Overall the story was great. Good character development, some good pay-offs, great relationships made along the way and it really allows you to connect with most of the main characters.Towards the end things get very difficult for the characters we learn to love, giving us many emotional scenes and a bittersweet ending. To be honest, the ending almost made me tear up.There are some moments where things happen because they need to, such as the tunnels randomly coming every 2 minutes when they needed it despite being gone for half the movie and then never to be seen again. If you can look past those things you get a entertaining zombie movie I think many would enjoy and some may even love.There is a sequel and I don't feel like I will watch it. This movie has a great conclusion and I feel as though the sequel won't be able to live up to the original at all.

Horde of zombies popped out of glasses or holes like cluster of insects, then may or may not piled up remind me of World War Z 3. Using tape as for arms protection remind of me The Walking Dead. 4. Pack of zombies knit/ bridge themselves to the train reminds me of World War Z, although it'snot wall. 5. The stupid villain live through nearly the end, some of his actions remind me of those few characters from Night of the Living Dead. 6.

It's hyper intense, emotional and heartbreaking all at the same time. I've never seen anything quite like it.I absolutely LOVE how it shows the rapid decline of civilization. One minute people are just normal people. The next minute those same people are leaving children and the elderly for dead just to save their own skin. It's visceral, disturbing and ABSOLUTELY realistic (which is something zombie movies rarely are).The movie is extremely fast paced and rarely takes its foot off of the accelerator. This keeps you on the edge of your seat, and always wondering what's going to happen next.The director did an excellent job at painting a scenario where no one was safe. You feel the same way about the characters too. You really don't have any clue who's going to die next, and that's SO refreshing to me.If you're like me and love all things zombie related then you HAVE to watch this film!",Train to Busan

650,BamBamxxxx,"Good, But Annoying to Watch",6,16 September 2016,"The movie was entertaining, but annoying and often incomprehensible. The infection starts on the train basically because the first two individuals to encounter the infected woman were apparently deaf. For some reason the train usher or whatever didn't hear the infected woman slam onto the train behind him, and the stewardess didn't hear the infected woman getting back up behind here. There were a lot of people standing or sitting watching things happen in front of them. Infected fell from helicopters and got back up without broken limbs. The concept that the infected completely can't sense people simply because they're in slight darkness is a bit ridiculous. The baseball boy sat holding his infected girlfriend and got himself killed by her, how romantic, but stupid, and to be expected from a Korean production. The older woman opening the door to the infected because...she went crazy? I don't know. Just seemed like a way to kill off the rest of the passengers. The father putting his hand over the infected man's mouth was absurd, but heroic and cliché. Overall this movie was frustrating to watch. It was filled with logic errors, and needless actions for emotional impact and to move the plot along.

It had great characters, good acting (especially the daughter), believable story line, excellent suspense, and pacing. So what was wrong with it?

If you are looking for something truly entertaining to watch, this movie is it!",Train to Busan
668,JessMazo-1,Could have been great,4,28 September 2018,"What started as a phenomenal well acted beautifully shot interesting take on a zombie movie starts flatlining at the end with humans doing stupid nonsenseSpoilers:
There are a few scenes where people self sacrifice and I love it. If it's done well and has a purpose. One of the mains gives up his life to hold a door. Cool! makes sense. We all liked that guy now we're sad. 
Then for no reason at all one of the old ladies just hangs out staring at her friend and gets attacked. Umm what?
Want even more dumb? The lady who watches her friend die is like hmmm I wanna die or something. Not really clear but opens up a door to let in a horde of zombies. Why? Who knows. Do you care? Not really. 
A sports guy running with the sports girl go into a train and after spending the whole movie keeping train doors closed behind them, you know: cause zombies, they don't and she gets attacked because jerk guy is alive and screws then over so sports guy could leave since everyone has died and turned and he's like nah let's hug it out. She eats him. 
The rest becomes a tense struggle for survival as the train conductor leaves the train for some reason to help jerk guy. Not sure what his plan was. No weapon and obviously no fighting ability so -dead 
then the ending is so dumb that it boggles my mind someone was like ""green light this baby."" Have the main character fight off jerk guy, who's in the process of changing but wait until he goes full zombie instead of kicking him in the crotch and throwing him off the train. So his solution: oh man you're gonna love this, he comes behind jerk and can grab him anywhere: feet, stomach, arms but no shoves his hand right in his mouth. Because yummy. So he's dead and could have been a reason other than to kill off the cast a few days into shooting for eating into the budget
Then the very end they stop the train in front of creepy tunnel and soldiers on other side about to shoot and stop when they hear the girl singing because why wouldn't you sing in a dark tunnel when you've BEEN CHASED BY ZOMBIES FOR 2 HOURS AND CANT SEE $HHT???",Train to Busan

The background score is very effective. The Koreans do know how to make a great movie! MUST WATCH!!",Train to Busan
670,pteodori,Edge of your seat horror!,7,6 May 2020,"This movie is two hours long, and from the moment the zombies appear about 20 minutes into the movie, it keeps you on the edge of your seat. Some of the scenes are almost unbearably tense. It is exciting but also sad because you grow to know and to like most of the characters in the movie and you don't want them to fall into the hands of the zombies.But by the end of the movie I felt not only sad but also burdened for some reason. I couldn't understand why because the movie itself was very well-made and enjoyable. And I wasn't bothered that the movie didn't end the way I wanted it to. No, it was something else.And I thought about it and I think it has something to do with the filmmakers way of looking at things, of their way of understanding the world. I know it's a fictional story of course, but what kind of a world is it where the reward for the incredible acts of bravery and of self sacrifice that some of the characters in the movie go through is to turn them into unthinking, ultra-violent bloodthirsty monsters!And then it occurred to me that it must have something to do with the filmmakers way of looking at things. It's a sad place indeed where your reward for incredible acts of bravery and of self-sacrifice is to become an ultra-violent unthinking monster. There is no redemption for these people, so they are running and fighting for nothing! Everyone here was hopelessly doomed from the very beginning.They say Jesus name in the movie but they use it merely as an exclamation as they often do in American movies. God cannot save anyone here because no one believes in him!",Train to Busan
671,adrienahlstrom,One of the absolute best zombie movies.,9,5 May 2020,"This is one of my favourite movies i've seen and even though it is in Korean and i don't speak Korean everything else in the movie massively makes up for that, from the story, to the thrilling moments, plot revelations, action, realism(as much as a zombie movie can have). it has it all. The movie is also not afraid to get rid of main characters and unlike movies like WWZ no main character has ""Hollywood immunity "" to getting infected and that makes the movie a lot more tense and exiting.
Definitely worth a watch if you like apocalyptic or zombie movies and even if those aren't your favourite movie categories i would still recommend this movie.",Train to Busan

674,sinhaashray,it's not a zombie movie,10,9 March 2019,"Yup, it's different. although zombies are the central element of the storyline, this movie just about zombies and survival and that's what i loved about this movie.
It's about decisions we make. its about the good and bad in us. its about that transformation between good & evil and Yeon Sang-ho tries to show it in almost every part of the movie. with an ending of so much stillness after an intense action scene this movie is a masterpiece in itself.",Train to Busan
675,timperee,Nice action but stupid acting,5,2 May 2021,"I don't know what Asians are used to, but the characters in this movie were extremely annoying, dumb and slow. Most are more brainless than the zombies, they basically just sit around waiting to be eaten. Fighting each other, committing suicide, screaming a lot... it's a very annoying movie. The ""freeze"" response seems to be the go to behavior of most characters, their will to live is pretty much non-existent. The movie tries to be emotional, but there are only a few interesting characters. It starts out well but falls flat eventually... a pity because it had real potential!",Train to Busan
676,freyabrighid,Not just another zombie movie,10,20 December 2019,"While it does have many similar components to other zombie movies, this stands above and beyond most. The acting is good, as is the storyline. Exceptional cinematography. Well worth the watch.",Train to Busan
677,fatherdewitt,The best zombie movie of all time,10,26 August 2018,This movie is unlike any other. I know you're probably saying this sounds generic like any other review I've read but let me change your mind. I'm an advid movie viewer and I haven't seen something so intense yet breathtaking in a horror film such as this one. From starting off seeming generic to completely throwing you off and taking you on a journey you didn't expect. It's breathtaking art work and character performance captures the essence of the viewer and delivers something emotionally engaging that rarely comes from movies especially a horror movie. Please give this movie a chance because it's definitely worth a watch.,Train to Busan

It's introduction to characters is done in a special way and at a good pace to make you almost feel connected to them. I, personally, didn't care if the zombies were slow or fast, or even if you'd consider them zombies. Their relentless speed kept me on edge the whole movie! It definitely displays the effects of ""Selfishness vs Selflessness"" and the ""Collective vs the Few"".
It's just such a beautiful movie that doesn't get the recognition it most definitely deserves!!Side Note: On the date of me writing this review, (8/16/2020), Train to Busan is on Netflix but if it's not when you view this, it's definitely worth the purchase. You won't regret it!",Train to Busan

Referring to the train. It allows for a realistic sense of claustrophobia making scenes that much more suspenseful. Nowadays it feels like there is no originality within films however this film is different from the rest.It nails all aspects of what a good film should be. The incredible story allows for a simplistic but powerful ending. The acting should be mentioned as a big plus, with all actors providing an outstanding performance which gives the story a sense of verisimilitude.This film is a perfect example of what horror should be.",Train to Busan

686,Re-view,One of the best zombie / horro flicks out there,8,19 August 2019,"*** This is a fair and even handed review - I'm not one of these idiots that marks either 1 or 10 for every film they watch because they don't understand the context ***Even if ""Train to Busan"" was ""just another zombie film"", it's one of the best out there. Ranking with the originality of Romero's Dead series, through to the panic of ""28 days"" and ""28 weeks later"", and the scale of ""World War Z"". It's a great ""monster in the house"" set up, the house being a train and the surrounding cities and stations - and the monsters, some form of fast infected sprinting zombies, that stop at nothing to prey on the living. It's worth watching just for the sheer carriage to carriage excitement, and the jerking and twisting Zombies as they awaken, along with a fresh take on their abilities.But at heart, it's a beautiful story of a fathers relationship with his daughter, and the sacrifice parents make to keep their children happy and offer them the best in life. It's filled with plenty of additional memorable characters that you form a strong bond with: love, understand, or hate - and plenty in between. It's definitely got a Korean / Manga feel. From the dread of the opening scene, the poignant score, to the special effects, and pacing - it's a great film on it's own, and even better within the genre - which has certainly been hard to do these last 20 years.It's an action packed and emotional roller coaster from start to finish, with plenty of jumping moments and even some tear jerkers!If you're a zombie fan, it's a must see, and almost everyone else will enjoy it too.8/10",Train to Busan

695,averytanman,Eh,5,10 December 2020,"Train to Busan is one of those biological disaster films that we have all no doubt revisited during the COVID-19 pandemic with a hyper-aware familiarity regarding the effects of a virus outbreak. I, however, found myself feeling the same unfazedness watching the film a second time as I did the first time. Train to Busan was branded as a horror movie, and yet I found its jumpscares and attempts at shock to be comical at best. With a main cast that felt like the amalgamation of the most generic character tropes possible, plus cheesy scriptwriting on par with the likes of Riverdale, it managed to place a sob story father-daughter relationship above the pressing conflict of a global apocalypse crisis. For example, in some scenes it is almost as if the imminent zombie wave in the background simply pauses while Gong Yoo's character and his daughter have a spontaneous heart-to-heart, or in other scenes the zombies blatantly go limp and allow themselves to be beaten to a pulp by Ma Dong Seok where they were previously rabid and ferocious.Beyond the awkward scene transitions and unrealistic fight scenes, the overall premise of a destructive virus outbreak turning humans into mutants was frankly delivered in the least creative way. Keeping the cast stuck in an enclosed space (a train) was probably one of the lowest hanging fruits in terms of a thriller-type setting. Having been an avid viewer of Korean film and TV, I like to think I can tell apart an original movie/series created for art's sake versus a movie made primarily for cheap entertainment or to garner tickets in the box office. This film, unfortunately, falls in the latter category. Painfully forced tearjerker scenes and the constant demise of everyone but the main character contribute to an overall tone of formulaic storytelling devoid of creative risks or surprises. Train to Busan is great fun if you're looking for surface-level entertainment on a Friday movie night. But it lacks any sort of original substance comparable to the previous film that lead actors Gong Yoo and Jung Yu Mi collaborated on, The Crucible (2011), which I would say is a much more worthwhile watch.",Train to Busan
696,succmeplsbby,Genuinely impressed and satisfied.,9,2 January 2021,"For once it's not a zombie movie where human vs human takes the spotlight from human vs zombie. I'm genuinely satisfied with the execution of the movie overall. the acting was superb along with the pacing. My only gripe is the slew of sudden character deaths at the end, most felt a little unneeded but they achieved the goal of making me sad. but that aside I genuinely had fun watching this, my heart was beating fast with certain scenes, and I was invested in the characters. I can even look past some of the obvious CGI since it isn't bad, just obvious. Honestly, it depresses me that it's this hard to come by a good piece of zombie media. They always take the main focus from the zombies to make it something like the nature of man or the origin of the outbreak. You see a lot of zombie media having evolved forms of zombies because the writers don't think flesh-eating zombies can keep your attention. save for games that usually execute evolved infected well. Essentially I come to a zombie movie/comic/manga/anime for the zombies, and I want my zombies, Train to Busan is one of the few if not the only one to do it right. Watch this movie, you won't regret it.",Train to Busan

703,tmattso2,Wow. Just wow!,10,27 March 2017,"This is my first review on here, and I was so blown away by this film that I just had to come on here right after viewing it to share my experience! First off, all I can say is WOW! My heart is still racing and I still have tears in my eyes (and I honestly RARELY cry in response to any film)! The characters are so well-developed and right from the beginning (and literally to the very LAST moment of the film) I genuinely felt for these characters and felt like I was actually with them, experiencing a huge range of emotions from fear to sadness to even some funny moments, all which are very sincere and portrayed by top- notch acting. I'm so tired of all the bad, cheesy, cheap movies on Netflix, but after reading so many great reviews of this film I decided to give it a try - and boy am I impressed! This is not your typical zombie film - Hollywood, please take note of this - THIS IS HOW A ZOMBIE MOVIE should be! It explores so much more than just ""zombies"" - it shows what is at the core of humanity and society; it explores ethics and what people will do in a crisis and to fight til the end to survive - all without going too deep or being too corny. The cinematography is incredible and the acting is really what blew me away - especially the little girl - I admit she won my heart and I was crying along with her at the end when her father sacrifices himself for her and the pregnant woman. If a film can truly make its audience care so much for its characters like this film does (kudos to the director!), it ups the tension even more and we feel a true connection to these characters - WOW! That is a RARE but fabulous thing! Please watch this movie - even people who don't like ""zombie"" movies will love it - perfect mix of horror, drama, and suspense! I love how the director used a very claustrophobic atmosphere and whittled it down to being even more claustrophobic - amazing! You will not be disappointed! I was glued to the screen the entire time while watching this! The best zombie movie ever - and don't let the subtitles turn you off - it is not overly dialogue heavy and the subtitles do not distract from the film! What a thrill ride! I'm still on the edge of my seat! So impressive, especially it being a foreign film - that might turn some people off but give it a try - you will not be disappointed! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! I'm a huge horror junkie and it is a rare thing to have a horror film affect me so much - but this is more than just a ""horror"" film - it connects its audience with its characters in such a way that you actually feel like you are on this train to Busan right along with them! I can honestly say that I felt cramped, claustrophobic, and on the edge of my seat the entire time watching this (and I admit I LOVED it! What a ride)! I'm just so overly happy that I finally found an amazing film on Netflix! ""Train to Busan"" is by far the best film I've seen this past year! Simply blown away. :-D",Train to Busan

The directing is so well done that you feel every emotion there is to feel. The zombies behavior is very believable, as how they are fast and fearless and unmerciful. Of course the train aspect if it is very terrifying. However, very realistic in terms of people reacting the way they did and dying the way they did. The ending is very simple yet perfect for the thriller that happened previously.The plot of how exactly its started is still vague. I really hope they make a prequel, where they show people stuck in the beginning of the riot. Showcasing the madness of how it first spread between people and the police. As a group tries to escape, they die one by one until the girl that gets bitten rides the train to Busan.Amazing job and good work to all those participated 👏🏻",Train to Busan

The cinematography, amazing! There are some really great scenes in this movie which I highly respect the director!

Yes, it does contain the zombie tropes and the characters nicely fall into the stereotypes: the jock, his girlfriend, the bad-ass, the evil businessman, Jordan Gekko, the little girl, the survivor, the old ladies,...But this is where the movie's strongest asset works: like TWD, it manages to make you care about the characters. The story leaves you just enough time to connect with them. Sometimes with a slice of comic relief, although to the movie's credit, that is not overdone either. It never becomes a jokey joke-thing and that's a quality as well.Once the zombies come into play, all the right buttons are pushed at the right moment. Timing is a quality not to underestimate.The moments that are meant to be tension filled succeed in doing so (the actors do a great job at making the characters look determined in their quest to survive) and when it wants to tug at your heart strings... well, it simply does. Some moments (like with Jin Hee and her boyfriend) are touching, but there is a moment near the end between Jordan Gekko and the little girl that is simply gut-wrenching. In terms of emotional impact, it's right up there with Sophia walking out of the barn, if you will. But in a different way.So, in short, it's a success all across the board. Highly recommended for horror fans.",Train to Busan
715,sanchitsreekanth,Best zombie movie ever imo!,10,19 July 2020,"Being a fan of the horror genre and seeing how overused and cliched the zombie movies was getting, it was really awesome to see a fresh and entertaining idea for a zombie apocalypse. For something that could have gone down the roads of snakes on a plane this movie was wayy better than many of the zombie movies out there. You have very great actors who you can get behind and root for. You have the loving husband, a father, pregnant woman, cheerleader, college brats and you have the greedy selfish capitalist a-hole of a CEO. The overarching theme of selfishness and selflessness, survival and panic is all a key part of this movie.This movie was incredibly entertaining, really heartfelt with every character having a wonderful arc with some truly emotional scenes which is something you normally don't get in a zombie movie. I really recommend you watch this especially if you love the horror genre. 10/10 movie for me",Train to Busan

The climax is so powerful and so sudden I couldn't even prepare to try not to tear up, it just happened. The transitions between genres blending this masterpiece together are seamless and are the backbone of its over all success.While there are a few character moments you could call questionable, if you really think about it, some people are just dumb enough to be even more irrational and stupid when fear takes over. So something that you see and go 'i would never do that!' well, maybe you wouldn't, or maybe you don't realize you might in that situation, or the person next to you might.It becomes a character study part way through, at which point you realize, the villain of the movie isn't the zombies.Over all, if you can handle the heart crushing devastation, don't miss this movie.",Train to Busan

722,elmeanyo-48242,WWZ... in Korea!,9,27 March 2017,"This flick could be during the WWZ universe, but in another place, South Korea. The zombies behave just like the WWZ zombies. Bite you, 1-2 mins later, depending on the severity of your injuries, and you are a fast running, hyper-athletic flesh eater, pulsating in crowds fighting over each other to get at the living flesh in a undead wave.Other than the characteristics of the zombies, the movie is quite different from the aforementioned title. The scope is contained to a relatively small band of survivors, trapped on a high-speed train from NW Seoul to SW Busan during the onset of an outbreak.The scope of the movie concentrates on a 30-something fund manager and his neglected 10-yo daughter, on their way to visit her mother and his ex-wife. Begrudgingly, he accepts this journey in an effort to please his daughter on her birthday, a day in which he gives her the same present he gave her last year. Much tears and reflection sets up the strain between the two and his later efforts to redeem himself.From here, all hell breaks loose. An infected passenger soon turns the bulk of the passengers on the train into zombies, in a scene very reminiscent of the WWZ airplane scene. The end result is the survivors desperately trying to survive in the enclosures between the train-cars.Like any good disaster movie, just when you think it can't get worse, it does. That is as far as I will go with the plot, to avoid spoilers.So, I loved the movie, but it requires you to not think about the logic too much, if you know anything about Korea. The fact that the infection spreads faster than a speeding train. That no guns or military presence is available, despite the fact that every Korean male is required to serve in the military for X number of years. For most western audiences, they won't notice and it doesn't detract from the fun.A++",Train to Busan

It had been on my list to watch for a while so I decided to give it a shot.... wow! I was skeptical because I had never seen a South Korean film but that blew my mind! This movie is definitely in my top 3 of all time and might possibly be my favorite of all time(not counting zombie comedies). The character development was amazing for this type of movie! The zombies weren't too dumb looking which I was afraid would be the case. And it actually had a good ending! The movie was well made and well acted.

The main characters are introduced quite well at the begging, and well developed during the movie. For example the dad. A fund manager by the name of Seok-woo, is shown since the start that he is not a guy that spends time with his daughter, he shows it by giving her a Wii when she already had one. During the duration of the train ""adventure"" the son and daughter develop a relationship that was hidden inside of both of their minds.

738,johnsonzac,"Train to Busan: Action, Horror, and Sadness.",9,14 March 2019,"Train to Busan is a movie that you probably haven't heard about. I didn't either until my dad forced me to watch it with him. He didn't tell me much about it, except that it was a zombie movie. We've seen zombie movies, the cliche walking corpses and the race to survive. I figured it would be just like them, and wasn't prepared for much. Boy, was I wrong. If you can get past the subtitles, you should brace yourself for an emotional, action-packed and morally challenging adventure, as there is nothing like this movie and I doubt there will be for a long time. Unlike well-known zombie-horror films/shows like The Walking Dead or World War Z, Train to Busan manages to create an emotional attachment to the characters. Even though the main character starts out as a prick, we still feel for him and want to see him improve. It kind of reminds of me of the movie Shaun of the Dead, in the sense of a unique approach to the cliche. Shaun of the Dead takes a more comedic and wacky approach to the cliche, with some hints of seriousness, and Train to Busan takes a serious and somewhat realistic approach, with some comedic moments, which is a good balance. The movie somehow packs in these emotional attacks with exciting unique action into a two-hour film, making it hands down the best zombie survival movie along with providing a unique and enjoyable experience.The film starts with the main character Gong Yoo (It's Korean) sitting in an office space and is depicted as a supervisor or administrator of a large corporation. He returns home for his daughter's birthday, late, and gives her a Wii U, which she already got from her mom. He also missed her singing performance, causing her to lose confidence and stutter out of singing. Right off the bat, we know that he's not the best father, but he still cares for her. Things get serious when they board a train to the city Busan to see her mother, as a strange and hysterical woman sneaks on board. Of course, that woman is what you would call a zombie, and thus the classic virus spreading action begins. While their whole city is worrying about their own zombie attack, we get to see it from the point of view of train passengers who are cramped in a small linear passage trying to survive.If you were to just look up the movie and take a glance at it, it would look silly. It's hard to make a zombie movie not look ridiculous. Now before you say ""Well it's a zombie movie, isn't that silly?"" While that is true, the movie somehow takes a silly and cliche concept and magically turns it into something serious, exciting, and original. Of course, there are some inescapable unrealistic moments; such as train security not noticing a clearly strange woman without a ticket board the train, or nobody regarding the woman while on the train. Those are just nit-picky things you can't avoid.Every movie has its faults, yet the faults in Train to Busan don't even come near to how amazing the film is. As I've said before, the pure emotional value packed in with exciting action makes it so great. I don't know exactly how they did it, but I can tell you that the two ""Us vs Them"" and ""Me vs Us"" themes play a big role. Us vs them is pretty obvious; a group of strangers banded together to fight the evil zombies outside, sharing resources and information. However, the Me vs Us theme goes a bit deeper. Would you sacrifice everything for a bunch of strangers you just met on a train? Or would you abandon them in hopes to survive on your own? We witness the characters go through these decisions and change as the story progresses. Gong Yoo was a businessman who wouldn't raise a thumb to help the poor, yet later on, he risks his life for a homeless man by turning back to help him up to run from a horde of zombies. After watching the movie I felt the effects of its message.Along with moral challenges, by the end of the movie, you will shed a tear. Trust me. You will feel sorrow for the characters. This is one of the few movies where I actually felt sad after watching it, and that's saying something for being a zombie movie. I definitely wasn't prepared for it, and it hit me like, well, a train. A lot of movies you will forget about after a couple of weeks, and some you will hold on to for a very long time. This is one of those that you will hold on to.",Train to Busan

This is a Korean movie which about zombies attack in the train. The story is amazing and I as a viewer can't guess anything during I watch it. During watching this movie I also can feel the emotions felt by the actors and actresses. That fear, worry, and disgust when I see the zombie.
And I think, this movie is not just about a zombie movie. There's a implied message that tells us about humanity. How to be kind each other even though you don't know that person. How to helping each other in urgent circumstances. And how not to think just about yourself.
I am also surprised that I had cried when I saw one of the scene I feel really touched my heart. It teach that love between a children and their parents is truly pure. Although sometimes their actions show otherwise, but that is only to cover up their pride.
I just want to say, I RECOMENDED THIS MOVIE!! So don't you dare, you're not watch this movie hahaha",Train to Busan

744,j-85409,The train to Busan,7,3 June 2019,"The Train to Busan is a thrilling horror unlike any I have seen before. Director Sang-ho Yeon puts his own spin on a large scale zombie outbreak, after a chemical lab releases a deadly virus. Unsuspecting passengers board a train that will cause them to see much more than the little girls mother. Innocent passengers must endure the seemingly never-ending train ride to Busan as they watch the cities of Korea fall around them, after a plant known for making mistakes releases the airborne virus. Although it as an apocalyptic style zombie fight-for-survival type movie, I wouldn't put it in the same category as some of the other prominent titles in the genre such as I Am Legend, or even World War Z.Sang-ho Yeon added a new twist and stayed away from the typical 'tough guy gunning down zombies to save the world' approach of many similar movies, and focused on capturing the chaos happening during an apocalypse in the dense modern urban setting of South Korea. The characters consistently keep the audience on the edge of their seat because of the deeper emotional connection we are able to establish at the beginning by being able to relate to them. Because the language utilized in this movie is Korean it allowed me to focus more on character's emotions and facial expressions; this, however, does not take away from the film in my opinion. One of the key strengths of this film is the breathtaking camera work and shot choice, that helps engage the audience on a new level as we are immersed into their world. A large range of film techniques are used in this film and the utilization of subjective point of view shots greatly add to the already immersive film. South Korea being the setting of the film gives the audience an inquisitive urge to keep watching as each turn and bend is foreign to us. The director's definitive choice of setting for each shot aids the suspense and ""on your toes"" feeling for the duration of the movie. Unlike many of the other apocalyptic movies many of us have seen, the acting in this film is absolutely phenomenal. Going into this movie I had very low expectations for quality of acting, especially since I did not recognize any of the cast from previous movies. Each actor elegantly played their roles and spared no emotion. This blew me away as most other movies I've seen like this have focused on making a few characters look badass as they power their way through crowds of zombies, but this movie was different. Each character felt real and as the audience we really connect with them, feeling like we would have made the same choices.A combination of intricate detailed set pieces, carefully chosen shots, and remarkable acting took this seemingly average zombie apocalyptic movie, to an invigorating emotionally engaging thriller that contracted my attention throughout. Not once did I feel like checking my phone or going to the bathroom, as this movie had me completely immersed from the opening scene to the the final credits.",Train to Busan

Nevertheless, the cast chemistry and overall acting was superb! I always feel like all zombie movies seem the same but this one had funny moments, loving moments and very sad moments.Now for the comments on the female characters. I see some people commenting on the legs, breast, thighs and other parts of the cheerleader like she is some object and thats just repulsive. Some others felt the need to point out the the pregnant character was ""ok"" as if that was more to turn off the male viewers rather than a major plot of the story. Showing us how fathers do sacrifice so much and sometimes get very little praise. He gave his life up in the movie for his pregnant wife and baby who he has not even met.

Truly heartbreaking :( So many questions are left unanswered as well! Just because the two of them survive the problem, doesn't mean the problem is solved! How do they solve the problem? By killing them all? Finding an antidote? This could also be a good thing however, a strategy, leaving the audience hungry for answers to their burning questions. For me, I like happy endings, where everything is solved, so I wasn't too happy with the ending. Maybe we can get a sequel?? hehe.",Train to Busan

And it is understandable, how can a movie be interesting if there are hundreds of movies about the same topic? Well, this movie, thankfully managed to impress and keep my eyes open every single second. As most Korean productions I have seen, special effects are top tier. The plot is not only about people running away from the zombies, but it tells a particular story a little bit different from what we are used to see on these movies. And, oppositely to what we are used to watch or expect on zombie movies, Train to Busan provides a soft moment that touched my heart and made my tear-up a little. This is not just another zombie movie, this is one that I really and highly recommend.",Train to Busan
773,fabiolac-43316,i loved it - review for school pls ignore ty,10,25 September 2020,"The end of the world. It sounds scary, right? When we think of the end of the world some people think of an asteroid hitting the earth. Others think we might be the reason for the end of the world. Another one would be zombies somehow become a real thing and we all eventually die, fun right? Train to Busan is a zombie thriller movie that follows Seok Woo, his daughter and other passengers trapped on a bullet train in Seoul, trying to survive while an outbreak of zombies is beginning. The movie has comedic moments to terrifying moments that have you at the edge of your seat with your heart racing, wondering what happens next. I did laugh many, many times. But I also cried quite a lot, for a good amount of time but I digress. While just meeting these characters, you just can't help but care and get a soft spot for certain ones. But there are a few where you just can't bring yourself to like, no matter what. I know I certainly couldn't like a few of them. But whether you like them or not, they still have you chewing on your fingernails, wondering what comes next.
As the title says, they are on a train heading towards Busan, South Korea. As most of you know, South Korea is known for its clean big cities, mostly polite citizens, and just all around a nice place. Well those once clean and advanced cities turn into these bloody, terrifying, and dangerous places. Even before all the chaos happened, the beautiful scenery was shown just before it became bloody. You can be enjoying a nice little moment while suddenly boom! The complete opposite is shown right in front of you. I will admit I got jumpscared quite a few times. And you can bet that it will be full of bloody, neck-biting monsters.
The very first thing that you see is a man driving and he suddenly runs into a deer. Unfortunately, the deer does die and he drives off after. But what he didn't see was the deer standing back up, after it had died. Now I won't describe every single scene so a little later we meet Seok-Woo who lives with his mother and daughter, Su-an. But he really doesn't spend that much time with them since he does spend most of his time working. On his way home he lets it be known that Su-an's birthday is the next day so he buys her a Wii, but what he forgets is that he had given her one for Children's Day, yeah yikes! At this point I know I didn't like him very much, you're just wondering how could he forget what he gave his daughter for Children's Day. But, Su-an is obviously used to her father not being the most attentive father out there, wants to go see her mother in Busan. She calls her mom to tell her and begs her dad to take her or to even just let her go on her own, which would be crazy! Given that Seok-Woo had messed up once again, he agreed to take her. At this point you do feel bad for Su-an, I know I did. While there is no doubt that she loves her dad and grandmother, she just wants to go see her mom. Who knows how often she sees her, and when it's your birthday you want to see both your parents, if it's possible. So they set out to Busan the next morning.
On their way to the station you get a glimpse of the city and the emergency vehicles headed to Seoul. Ignoring what's happening in Seoul, they arrive at the station. Here is where you meet the rest of the characters. Two elderly sisters, a pregnant married couple, an awful businessman, and a baseball team. Everything is fine and everyone gets on the train but since this is a zombie movie, at the very last moment a visibly ill woman gets on the train. I honestly don't know how she got in without anyone else seeing her. I would have left that train so fast! In the matter of a few minutes, the train gets full of these violent killing machines. As we can all expect, everyone freaks out and they run, but once they figure out what's happening we have a few of them fighting back for the safety of themselves and the other passengers. Personally, in this situation I can't say for certain what I would do but I like to think that I would help the people around and at the end that would hopefully lead them to help me back. You have to work together to survive this. But Seok-Woo does tell Su-an, ""At a time like this, only watch out for yourself."" At the time he definitely believed this but as time went on he knew that this isn't something he should be living by or teaching his daughter. There certainly was a time where I thought the same thing, every man for himself. But it has become clear to me, that is not the case, just like Seok-Woo. Now, obviously I won't spoil anything but the survivors only survived because of the sacrifices of others.. And the selfish ones met their demise because they didn't think of anyone else besides themselves.
Before I watched it I heard many people say that it was an amazing movie they would recommend it to me but I just never got to it. Now that I watched it, I really do regret not watching it sooner. I honestly expected it to be like any other cliche zombie movie or tv show out there. It really did not disappoint at all. I liked everything about it, the characters, the plot, the way it was filmed. With the way that it ended, I certainly did not expect it at all. But I actually really did like it. Now I would express myself more about how I feel about it but I would be spoiling it so that is all I will say about the ending. Another thing that I also found interesting was the way that the zombies moved. When you think of zombies you think of them as these slow but deadly monsters. You don't usually think of them as these super fast zombies, but then again these are fresh, newly turned zombies so you definitely have to keep that in mind while watching, I know I would forget that every once in a while. Also the way they moved was pretty different. They were like spasms. They would jerk around super fast. Once again, I would 100% recommend this movie to everyone. It may not be in English but that's not a good enough excuse to not watch it. We have to expand our experiences, and not limit them to just what we know. This Korean movie is incredible! It also left me wondering how well I would do in a situation like this one. How would you do? Would you survive or would the dead consume you.",Train to Busan

It ended up being the hands-down best zombie movie I've enjoyed, with constant tension, freshness and a satisfying ending.Sometimes Korean movies of the last few years have an almost innocence or freshness which has all but disappeared from the US/UK productions, where you become truly engrossed in the story-telling and the simplicity of the screenplay works in favor of the movie. This flick is manipulative in all the right ways. It bring to mind The Thing (1982) in telling a straight-forward story that always keeps you on the edge of your seat and has you genuinely care for its characters. Highly recommended.",Train to Busan
784,woradabua,A movie that should not be missed!!,10,6 March 2021,"The story of Train to Busan is it about Sok-woo, a father with not much time for his daughter, Soo-ahn, are boarding the KTX, a fast train that shall bring them from Seoul to Busan. But during their journey, the apocalypse begins, and most of the earth's population become flesh craving zombies. While the KTX is shooting towards Busan, the passenger's fight for their families and lives against the zombies - and each other.
Train to Busan does a great job of using the characters as a key tool in connecting the audience to the story. And this is where the emotions and the thrill go so effectively. Because whenever a character can bring the audience to be ""The same team"" has been achieved. ""The same team"" fully. Another good part of the movie is casting a suitable cast, taking on the role, not too flattering to Gong Yoo. Looks nice and natural, it looks like he isn't high-maintenance. The shirt that you wear is smooth, beautiful, smooth, without wrinkles, even if it gets messy and dirty. And when someone else's clothes are wrinkled, they are in good shape, that is, a good clothes hanger. And what is indispensable to this is that it is a production as good as a Hollywood movie, stunning visuals and effects.
Even though the keenness in telling the point is still a little But this journey also reveals what humans and zombies mean as a product of capitalism.",Train to Busan
785,bsamirit,This emotionally charged and zombie filled train is worth boarding,8,12 March 2021,"Train To Busan (2016)
Rating: 4/5When you are about to watch a film in the zombie genre, you have two things in mind:
1) A lot many are going to die.
2) Zombies will provide us much gore.
Well ""Train To Busan"" has all that in plenty, but what it has which many zombie films lack is: Emotional depth. Throughout the film we are able to connect to each character. A fund manager, who is estranged from his wife, and fails to live up to his daughter's expectations; A strongly built man and his pregnant wife; a baseball player and a girl who loves him; a selfish as hell man; two old women who are sisters and many more form characters who are fighting for survival from zombies, in a train which is travelling to Busan. Will they survive?Director Yeon Sang-ho makes sure that while he shows the undead masses of bodies attacking the passengers of the train, we are connected to each of them. ""Train to Busan"" is a story of survival, compassion, sacrifice. It shows us how human beings act together to fight something bigger, which felt timely as we are in the midst of a pandemic ourselves. Then there's ones who are selfish. Take this scene as an example: The fund manager and all are trying to enter another compartment of the train, but the passengers of that compartment are paranoid that they might be infected, and they try to stop them from entering.While there's gore, but the film doesn't overdo that. There's some humour sprinkled, like the scene where the pregnant woman's husband asks the fund manager's daughter whether he's her real dad, as he initially didn't like her father. There's humour, but there's the seriousness which runs throughout the film. From the opening scene where a dead deer comes back to life, we know that things are about to become tense and the entire film is very tense but entertaining.There was a scene in the film which I found a bit absurd: the fund manager, the pregnant woman's husband and the baseball player deciding to fight their way to reach their people felt a odd choice that a person would make in such a situation and I wanted the film to make more impact. But, this emotionally charged and zombie filled train is worth boarding.",Train to Busan
786,paolaromanocele,Train to Busan,9,17 March 2021,"This movie is like a ""common"" fiction movie about zombies, but it has a fantastic drama because it is not just about zombies and how a group of people try to survive and find a safe place, it has some sad moments and that's one of the reasons that it couldn't classify like a typical kind of zombie movies.
When you are watching Train to Busan for the first time, you think about some scenarios, all about how to survive of course, but it doesn't at all; at the beginning you watch a family problem, and it introduces how the apocalypse start, when all the apocalypses' zombie, it's a real problem in the movie, it's not the only reason that why the movie can get your all attention, because when you think all are going well, something sad happens. But the end is something that you can imagine when you are in the middle of the movie, but not the way what we predict.

Didn't know whether to switch off or laugh at some of the inconsistencies displayed by the characters towards the end. The dramatic effect attempts are out of place. Without going into spoilers, watch how the producers try to make the characters ""grow"" but instead it seems like they become more absurd and dumber towards the end.The use of the child was also incredibly annoying, added nothing but terrible whining and crying.

802,KateHawthorne,One of the Best Zomie Movies in a Very Long Time,9,24 December 2016,"It is going to be hard to review this movie without adding spoilers, but here goes: I rarely watch Korean or any films with subtitles because I usually watch movies or television while doing something else. But I had read so many good things about Train to Busan, and it was Christmas Eve, so I put down all my other things and watched. What a thrill ride this movie is! There isn't much wrong with this movie and if I told you why I dropped a star from 10, it would be a spoiler!! This movie is The Walking Dead when it was new, before action and bad guys took over from the character development and relationships of beloved characters. I was entranced from the first scene. Everything in this movie is excellent. The characters are very well developed and you get attached to them. The directing is just about perfect. The layout from beginning to end is exactly what I look for in any movie. Intelligence, action, strong characters, nearly perfect flow from scene to scene. While I know most people will put this in the Zombie Apocalypse category, I beg to differ. This movie would fit in Action Adventure, Thriller, and Sci Fi just as well. While the film is about zombies, this is a much bigger movie. If you like Action Adventure and Thrillers and don't mind or can even keep an open mind about zombies, I highly recommend Train to Buran. Even if you object to subtitles, I can attest that shortly into the film, you won't even notice them. Which means you won't see a Korean film with subtitles, you will watch a movie that is simply very entertaining, even a little humor thrown in, and it will absorb you to the point that your surroundings fade and you find yourself living in this movie. That is my highest praise that I can give any movie I see. That it supersedes all boundaries and delivers a movie where you don't think of it as a foreign movie or a genre movie or a movie about politics or causes you are tired of having jammed down your throats, or politically correct language, when you just want to get away from the everyday news or your job or your health or family squabbles. And it got almost 10 stars because it fulfills that list with excellent acting and breathtaking excitement. One more thought: even the many movies I watch that can catch me and pull me in, often there is some mistake or ungainly slow period or a moment that fits in the story from the Producers or directors eye, but causes a momentary glitch in my captivation of said movie. I can't remember one moment that took me out of the movie and brought me back to reality. Just a suggestion, get all bathroom breaks and snacks out of the way before you sit down and start watching Train to Buran. And, yes, a little fear is earnestly felt now and again, also. Watch this movie!! It really is worth paying for. And movies like this, in my humble opinion, are few and far between these days!",Train to Busan

There is a strong love story and life lessons about bravery/ethics for others.It has to be one of the greatest horror films I have ever seen.I will never forget it.That's right--a horror zombie foreign film in English subtitles.

807,dstef_ro,Not only zombie,9,4 August 2020,"Train to Busan is more than a zombie movie.
Also is about how important is a woman in our life. And about
selfishness and individual versus collective.
It is about the triumph of human life and the sacrifices necessary for human life to continue on earth.
It's easy to say that woman symbolized life in this film. In fact, the survivors are a pregnant woman and a little girl.
Because, life without women could not continue. This is the end that gives us hope for survival.
In ths movie, we are offered almost all the important representations that a woman can have, that of a wife, represented in the film by the pregnant woman (Seong-kyeong),
the one of the daughter represented in the movie by the little girl Soo-an, the one of the friend represented by the character Jin-hee, the two older sisters (possible grandparents)
In-gil and Jong-gil. Of these, only the first two survive because of the sacrifice that men from their lives, makes.
One of the two old sisters dies due to the selfishness of another interesting character Yon-suk, but the other sister sacrifices herself to avenge the death of her sister.
Jin-hee also dies because of Yon-suk and her boyfriend sacrifice, although he could very well have saved himself.
Yon-suk turns out to be a loner with only a mother waiting for him at home, hence his selfishness, to reach her at any cost, even treading on corpses.
The importance of women is often emphasized through the sacrifices made by those around, but especially because they are the foundation of our survival as a species. I didn't gave 10 because of some goofs, but really it's not so important.

808,kurtalilla,A fantastic MASTERPIECE,10,14 September 2016,"I usually don't like writing reviews as I truly believe that everyone should decide for him/herself what he/she likes, but now, I just couldn't handle myself. Train to Busan is a MASTERPIECE what everyone should see. No matter if you don't like the genre this movie is a MUST watch. Sure we saw the zombie apocalypse rise a million times, and sure we already saw something like this (the straight comparison that comes to mind is World War Z) but Train to Busan shines where all of its brothers and sisters fall short. The story is really well put together, we've got all the aspects in characters we need: the dad, the little girl, the though guy, the f***ing bastard you want to kill at the end, and they are NOT one dimensional characters, you ACTUALLY come to care for them. The acting is spot on without a question. It is heavily action-packed and OH GOD it is so beautifully put together that you will actually screaming on top of your lung for them, you will try to give them advice and the excitement will eat you up. I mean I almost had a heart attack during the scenes as I was so into the movie. And the cinematography of this film is actually shows Hollywood that a blockbuster can have a wonderful art-like scenery too. And it shows something else: that you don't need heavy CGI for a zombie movie... KHM... World War Z.... KHM.... if your zombies are running. Absolutely amazing.

1) The zombies run fast
2) The movie is in Korean
Apart from these 2 distinct features I couldn't find one part which stood out as a feature that would make me recommend this to anyone. *SPOILER AHEAD*

Why listen to a damn speech of an obnoxious turning man when you could have kicked him off from the train?!?!?

815,Wolfgang-Fuertner,well produced melodramatic zombiemovie full of action,8,13 October 2018,"Very good produced zombie movie with supreme camera work.
this film offers a pleasent variety of emotional scenes and very suspensefull action scenes where the passengers try to fight the threat of the zombies and escape the chaos.
main acters and dialoges beneath the chaos are very authentic and well played.
of course this genre doesnt allow a deeper look into the relationsheep of the passengers. nevertheless the sideplot fillins are very well placed. at the beginning of the movie dialoges seem a little exaggerate emotional, but the longer the zombie threat lasts, the more the main family fights its way to the heart of the observer, only possible due to the zombie virus threating there life's.
As good and authentic as the main acters may be, sidecast zombie actors are not authentic and in some scenes one truely can see how the actors have fun playing those zombies. unuasual about this zombie movie is, that the zombies seem to have a fast motion pace, which makes it even harder for the passengers to shake them off. All in all this film leaves a mark due to the very good production and tension, shock moments, and emotional sequences. the storyline could have been a little bit more extended and sideplot dialogues could have been a little bit more lively and longer, wheres the zombies could have been a little bit less lively in my point of view. nevertheless the emotional dialogues and melodramatic sequences this film shows leaves a mark in ones mind and heart and makes this film mezmerizing.",Train to Busan

830,iTeleb,Simply amazing,8,24 February 2018,"Hello,First, I'd like to mention that this is my first time writing a review and second time watching a foreign movie.The movie's plot is about a virus that breaks out in South Korea (obviously) whilst our main character and his daughter board a train to get to Busan, hence the movie name, so the daughter can see her mother. 
In the first 25 minutes of the movie nothing of interest happens, but a few scenes that won't make you adjust your seating. Highlights are an infected girl entering the train and (presumably) the president giving a speech on national TV, trying to calm the citizens and telling them that there are no zombies, just aggressive/violent people + the introduction of a married couple.
Fast-forward, the train is now full of infected people and the train has to stop at Daejeon where they will be quarantined, but the train passengers are unaware, which made me confused why won't you tell them that they will be quarantined; I mean at leas they know they will be safe? Why would the train stop even that they did not see any military personnel. why wouldn't the conductor try to recontact the command center?
Anyhow, people re-board the train and several thrill and drama packed fights happen as the survivors are split onto 3 different cars and try to reunite.
Another interesting point for me here: when the husband of the pregnant wife was trying to hold close the door, why didn't anyone just try to cover it as they know the infected people would become passive after it? The husband ends up dead in a drama of sacrifice for the sake of his wife and other survivors. Moving on to the next scene after the rest of the survivors manage to regroup in the last car, they were despised by the other group and obeyed their request to leave, which was weird as they were the much stronger group + armed with bats + they just finished fighting like 20 infected people. You can clearly see the hate of Seok Woo when he looks at the COO of the railroad company (remember this scene).The train later stops because of a blockage caused by containers even though I don't see a cargo train nearby. The conductor disembarks and tells other survivors to meet at the far left railroad. 
The COO of the company again sacrifices another person (the conductor in this case) so he can survive.
Now, Seok Woo meets the COO on the locomotive but he is still scared and passive, and a very weak fight scene takes place which results in our hero putting his hand in the infected COO's mouth for some reason. Hero gets infected, sacrifices himself, his daughter lives along with the pregnant woman yay!To put this short, Train to Busan put me in an amazing mood as I adore South Korea, but there many situations that I find weird, especially the COO fighting the father! That guy just made you lose your friends and is an egoist bastard, then he even tries to attack your daughter while he is infected, all that and all you can do is Ugh and Ahh?! Maybe I am not familiar with the South Korean culture and that they're peaceful by nature, but still the adrenaline rush would've helped.
Train to Busan literally feels like a trip through Korea and emotions for me even though you don't see much, but you don't feel like an outcast, you still feel heavily related to the characters and location, but I believe that the director could've made the death of Jin Hii more dramatic as they looked like an interesting couple. I appraise the fact that it wasn't an all pink everyone survives ending, you rarely see that these days.
I hope the sequel focuses more on the damage done to the cities and people, and makes you deeply related with 2 or 3 characters only instead of mildly interested in all of them.",Train to Busan

Great characters, intense, funny and with a lot of surprises. The movie breaks the typical script, off course that it has the typical clichés of the zombie movies but its shown in a different way. There are many situations that you never expect. The characters are natural, indeed you can feel close to them( that's a good thing when you are watching a movie), and its not usual in this kind of films. Also has the ""corean drama"" included but in a fun way (just my perception). I was surprised, and when a movie surprise you, you know that they did good their job. :)",Train to Busan

835,fredhamilton1,Zombie Drama,8,16 August 2018,"This review is for people like me who have put off watching this film for a while. Zombie movies are not my thing.Luckily I bit the bullet, as this is a excellent character film. It is 2 hours of touching moments or upsetting behaviour. The film shows the best and worst of people, which is often true in crisis.The movie is unfortunately hindered by a few cliches towards the end, perhaps because it was made to be a success at the Box office. Only small directing choices that I feel would be better removed. Character behaving same way three times in around five minutes. A Flashback and what I assume was meant as a 3D moment.So if, you have been putting off watching this, in fear of just another Zombie movie. Or you love Zombie movies.

Sang-ho Yeon does an incredible job with the film, and the actors give equally masterful performances. Watching the film I did feel as though there was a slight translational discrepancy between the Korean of the movie and the English subtitles, and that the movie held a slightly different meaning in its native tongue that couldn't be realistically kept across the translation. This did not detract from my experience overall and should not deter potential audience members. A must-have to any zombie movie watch list, this film cant be missed. Be warned however, 'Train to Busan' is not for the feint of heart, prepare yourself, and find someone to hold close, you'll probably be glad you did.",Train to Busan

No clear Protagonist or Antagonist, no real attempt at keeping a flow, the story line seems to be written for a TV show (walking dead wink wink) and got picked up for a movie. If you love Zombie Movies and want to see one from another country, watch Go Goa Gone from India.

841,Stinger911,A Masterpiece,10,1 August 2020,"Just saw this for the first time on Netflix. It has instantly entered into my top 10 films of all time, maybe top 5.It's tough to gather my thoughts, but my biggest takeaway is that this is a film about the importance of persevering through fear to protect what and who you love the most, even if it means that you become the victim to a an unthinking mob. It's about having the strength of character to do what is right and sacrifice yourself for your family and friends and to fight to the death against odds you know are impossibly against you.A very inspiring father-daughter story set against a backdrop of a zombie apocalypse happening in South Korea, Train to Busan is much more than just another zombie movie.Something I also liked that this movie pulls no punches and respects for the viewer's intelligence. The characters solve problems through clever means. There are no deus ex machina elements present. The gore and violence is shown with a disturbing steadiness rather than being over the top. The zombies themselves are portrayed moreso as humans with rabies than anything else. They don't run super fast, they don't have super strength, and they are not exceptionally durable. In this sense, the zombies are more believable. The female characters in the film are not endowed with Hollywood-ized GIRL POWER. Some of them do demonstrate bravery, but scenes are not written purely to push feminist agendas.The acting of everyone in the film was great. Exceptional credit must go to the little girl who plays the daughter of the lead actor. She was amazing and executed every scene she was in perfectly.Highly recommended.",Train to Busan
842,qiuyansehun,A touching movie,9,29 October 2016,"I knew it's a movie about zombie, but I didn't expect it's such a touching movie. I can see the humanism through the whole movie. The little girl just so king and touches my heart many times. Tha main male character have an other movie also strikes my heart, too. Many people just care about themselves and are very selfish. In this movie is very ironic that those people are all killed at the end.The people who has kind heart want to save people as more as possible. I watch the husband and his sacrifice, I started to cry. I watch the little girl's tears, I started to cry. There is something imperfect is that when they escape from the crash of the train, it's so coincident that it came another train, it's a little too dramatic and unrealistic. Anyway it's a really good Korea movie.",Train to Busan
843,telghareeb,Enjoyable overall but a bit too long,7,30 October 2021,The movie's enjoyable thrilling and emotional at the end but didn't need to be two hours long.Also the rules of how long it takes for an infected person to become a zombie were not clarified and it took different amount of time for different characters who were infected to turn which is annoying because it felt like they change the time required to turn depending on the character and the situation.,Train to Busan

845,jim-94764,Excellent Zombie Flick,9,24 January 2017,"First off, don't watch the trailer! If you're a fan of Korean cinema and modern zombies, just get straight to the film. The film has several genuinely good 'Oh my god' eye-budging moments for the viewer and they spoil some of those in the trailer.The film truly captures the stress, and anxiety of a WWZ zombie scenario. You agonize over the vulnerability of the survivors, especially when there's no Zeds in sight. It gets going fast, builds the characters surprisingly well considering they get little exposition, and kinda just keeps going on full steam for 2 captivating hours.It's not exactly all on a train, either. That premise put me off slightly as I thought it might get a little stale, or perhaps they were on a budget. But no, there's more to it. And even one or two original ideas, believe it or not.This film takes no prisoners. It's brutal and sad, but somehow keeps a certain charm. It has the most adorable child actor - who performs brilliantly imo - and whilst she's a weaknesses for the survivors, never feels like a burden to the story. You will be rooting for them at the teary end.",Train to Busan
846,jsullivan-50724,Actually really good,10,28 October 2019,"It's really a great movie, disregard the people dumbing it down.
I'm honestly appalled at all these shallow reviews. When a horror movie actually has depth, you're doing a disservice when you just babble about one girl who's barely in it. This ain't some silly slasher. Y'all are weird for focusing on a girl who gets maybe 10 minutes of screen time during a 2 hour movie, and you're just distracting from the fact that this is a zombie movie that is actually GOOD.Even though it ends up using one of my most hated tropes, this movie is pretty damn good. If you're completely sick of the genre, then maybe not so much. It's gotten difficult over the past decade to make a unique zombie movie, so there are always going to be familiar elements. But, it does focus on a child-parent scenario, which is not used in zombie movies very often (this invoked some of the same feelings as the short film Cargo), and the action is pretty constant so no one can really say it's boring. It definitely exceeded expectations.",Train to Busan

849,yinshiyi,Waste of time,4,27 September 2016,"Pure waste of time. Traditional cliché. Korean version of Hollywood movie ideas. It became boring 20 years ago. If in the ending, those soldiers would kill both of those survivors, then it would be more inspiring, and worth at least 6 out of 10. In a real zombie event, numerous innocent people would die. the correct decision should be selfish in order to survive in extreme events, such as war. The movie is trying to sell the idea of being selfless during war, which is completely unpractical. Traditional cliché, main actors always survive. (Strongly suggest ""Expect the unexpected"", where everyone die at the end.) There is no innovation in this movie, the story line is copied from ""World war Z"". This movie might do well in a domestic level, but it is far less qualified even to premiere in an international level. I would have given it 1 out of 10. But the ending tunnel part has some innovation, so final score is 4 out of 10. Bad cutting from director, if I were the director, I would have end the movie at the tunnel. At least it would end with possibilities, where I would mark the film 6 out of 10. Draw a Snake and Add Feet to It",Train to Busan
850,davidabildgaard-75284,Annoying passangers manage to remove my empathy for them,4,25 March 2021,Tired story. Most of the movie is spend watching people who can't for the life of them act with haste. Everyone is acting like in a perpetual shock that presumably renders them incapable of acting in benefit of their own survival. I'm disappointed the movie never rises above the braindead level. There is even a couple of times where people just decides to do suicide by zombie while putting everyone else at peril. Doesn't make much sense. 5/10.,Train to Busan
851,ajgcontacto,Great Movie,9,15 September 2016,"Well, this was a refreshing zombie flick, not ""horror"" or ""terror"" at all. I cannot figure out why it is reviewed as ""the scariest movie of the year"", it's not scary at all. Unless you are scared by Hello Kitty, or Asians. The origin of the plague is plausible and makes sense, we get just the necessary insight to know what happened. Character development is pretty good, taking into account it's a zombie movie and most of them die anyway. The first act of the movie sets a good pace, and then goes on with non stop action and, most important, plausible situations given the context of a Z apocalypse in a train. Loved/hated the ""Bad Guy"", one would expect most of humans will think and act like him. The little girl's acting in the end is very moving, 10/10. The ending for the good guy is a little dumb, he could have taken, at least in theory, that Z with no effort, he did it many times before, doesn't make sense. But, had he survived, the movie's ending would have been cheesy. So, in the long run, a good thing he died. Koreans are doing a great job delivering better and better movies, I really think this one is in the top 10 or 20 Z movies, and gives fresh air to a genre that has been flushed down the toilet recently.",Train to Busan
852,janey_villamater,"Thankful that I got stranded in the mall that day! ( September 9, 2016 - Friday )",10,10 September 2016,"Whenever I watch movies in the theater, I almost always choose one which is either on IMAX or 3D. My reason is that, Since I am spending my hard earned money to watch a movie on the big screen, it might as well be worth it or I'd rather wait for it on DVD or watch it online. Aside from that, since there have been a lot of awesome TV shows lately, which are written with more cliffhangers, I found that whenever I watch a 2D movie in the cold and comfy theater, I get sleepy and sometimes fall asleep before the end. Blame it on my short attention I guess. The other day I was at the mall and sort of got stranded because of a sudden downpour. And I decided to pass the time by watching a movie. I tried out the Director's Club theater at the new S. Maison beside the Conrad Hotel,and I ofted to watch the Korean movie ""TRAIN TO BUSAN"" because of the nice trailer that I saw on my Facebook feeds. I'll be honest, that at first I thought it was a bad decision, because I didn't know that the movie was not in English, and I thought that I would definitely fall asleep because I was so comfy in the cold temperature and lazy boy seats. But the movie was so THRILLING and ENGAGING that I was thoroughly entertained until the end, even though it was Korean and only English subtitles. Zombie plots in shows have been so common lately that I have lost interest in watching shows with zombies themes, such as ""The Walking Dead"" which was okay the first few seasons, but I feel was later on just been too violent and worn out.This movie, ""TRAIN TO BUSAN"" was a surprisingly fresh and pleasant to watch. I was thrilled and engaged in it until the ending. I recommend watching it, even if I rarely don't do movie reviews or movie recommendations. For me it was definitely money well spent.

853,ainuwijaya,Korean drama with zombies,4,15 September 2016,"The overall delivery of the film might be good, but if you delve to the fine detail of every scene, you'd see things that a little bit off and hardly believable. Zombie fall from a chopper can still walk, even run! with fully working limbs! Zombie soldier fall from station bridge broke his arm badly, duh..physics?Dad somehow noticed and took a baseball bat that no way can be seen unless he has x-ray vision...because moviesThe bad survivors wanted to lock the suspectedly infected hero- survivors, and they locked it in other, far side, or the car? Further from the zombies' reach? in a place safer than they currently are?? What a logic. They deserve to die alright.The kid say that she rehearsed the song for the dad and couldn't finish the song because the dad was not around. So the kid either never practice the song right in the first place (because the story imply that the dad was never home and saw his daughter practicing) or the kid is full of crap. I bet its both. Sorry kid.A locomotive could tow multiple cars, with hundreds of passengers on it, and could still speed. But the the movie wanted me to believe that a locomotive slowed down just because some zombies are clinging on it? duh..physics?The Dad feeds himself to zombie, which is unnecessary and ridiculous. Same goes for the boy that gets eaten just because, I don't know, he fell for the schoolgirl that is turning into a zombie? Why? Didn't the boy show a sign of discomfort to the lady in the beginning of the movie? Did they develop a feeling or had deeply romantic experiences off screen? Making the boy suddenly obliged to do 'till the death do us apart' sort of thing and could not pull himself together? Ah never mind, they're dead and lets left the plot hole right there.Dad suddenly understood how train works. This is sheer lazyness. Sparse character setup is not an excuse to conjure up absurd thing like as if manning a locomotive is a piece of cake.There are just too many death just for the purpose of drama. The writer/director maybe want the story to be more tragic or some sort, but who and how they die is just meaningless and almost stupid. Like why the tramp was kept alive that deep into the movie with no purpose and no impact to the story other than adding another pointless bait later? I mean it could be anyone, or I can just make up some crap that the zombies get tangled in cables to buy time. Oh no..let's just make someone does poop face before they die so the audience feel sorry for him/her. Not.You know what makes a better ending?

There wasn't really much of an explanation on how the infection started, but it's all good. The story revolves around Soo- an and her dad, and later with the other passengers. The story progression was decent. It was intense, calm, thrilling and emotional when it needed to be. Very well done.Cinematography: 10It was visually amazing. The effects on the zombie chase/battle, the blood, the look of the zombies, the camera angles- they were all really good! I saw a behind-the-scenes video on YouTube and I was amazed. I really liked the camera angles! The acting of the actors and actresses was also something to behold.Sound: 10This goes hand-in-hand with the cinematography. It was also intense, calm, thrilling and emotional when it needed. The sound effects were properly utilized and meshed together. The emotions that the characters feel can also be felt through their voices.Characterization: 9All the characters were interesting (even that evil CEO/COO guy). There are many emotions to the characters, and each of them (or each group) have their own way of survival. The character development of the main group (especially Soo-an and her dad) was splendid. I do feel that they killed too many characters ( I wanted Soo-an's dad and the pregnant woman's husband to survive- sorry I'm bad at remembering names) but I guess I just got attached to them.Overall: 10I loved this movie. I think the Good Stuff outweighed the Flaws that the movie had. It's not perfect but it was damn near close to it (in my opinion). It didn't scare me, but it kept me on the edge of my seat throughout the intense parts, and got my eyes watery in that ending. Overall a very fun and entertaining ""train-ride"". Definitely worth the hype.Note: This is my first review. I'm new to this stuff so maybe I just gave this one a 10 due to my enjoyment. Either way, I hope it was helpful. Do check the movie out, it is worth your money and time!",Train to Busan
855,ZacWillmore,Simply the best.,10,7 April 2019,My headline says it all Train to Busan is simply the best zombie movie ive seen in a while entertaining throughout. The Actors are superb and you care for them so quickly and are fully invested as soon as it all goes down on the Train.This is a Zombie movie but it's also a movie about a Dad and his Daughter and what a father would do and what lengths he would go to keep her safe.Truly a Zombie Masterpiece.,Train to Busan
856,vegitouhk,No ordinary horrible film,8,26 December 2016,"At first sight of this film, especially the trailer, i thought it was some sort of film which looks like World War Z, apparently they have the same background, fast running zombies in the city.However, when the film reached the time the zombies appearing inside the train, you will notice how the people reacted, this is the right moment of humanity, what will people choose at the critical moment of life and death, selfishness, lack of compassion coming into screen one by one.Despite these, you will also find how a selfish father, who always thinks of himself in the first place without paying attention to the people around him, turns into a thoughtful person, caring for people unknown to him and also co-operating with them with a hope to survive. It's hard to describe all in detail and hope you can enjoy this film in depth.",Train to Busan
857,shafayatreza,One of the best zombie movies ever seen,7,12 January 2017,"Great movie , and just loved it . But i am a bit surprised that not a single bullet of fire took place to kill a zombie. The pregnant girl was really really cute. Don't know what her actual name is. But just liked her .Her fighting husband and the little girl""s father and herself too . Good movie really to watch . It was a bit surprising about the late inter fair of the defense .But finally they protected the people.The most tragic scene was the father of the little girl""s death .The funny thing about the zombies was their senses were weak . They cant even see in darkness too . After all it was a good experience watching it on my laptop, smoking a cigarette while lights were off .",Train to Busan

The actors are very good at playing their roles. The zombies are very good as well. This movie all in all was nicely done, there wasn't really anything that made you go, ""What the heck? How did that happen?"". It all flowed smoothly.You will enjoy the movie immensely.If you are a zombie fan this is a must watch. It doesn't matter if you don't watch any Korean stuff, you have to watch this.",Train to Busan
859,hailander-01340,An overall excellent movie,10,9 October 2016,"A friend of mine recommended this movie. In his words, it would be ""a kickass Korean zombie flick"", so naturally i went into this movie expecting another generic, dumb, goofy zombie splatter film. Boy, was I in for a surprise!First of all, the acting is spot on. All the actors are doing a tremendously great job, but for me, little Soo-an Kim totally nails it in one of the best child actor performances I have ever seen. The zombie actors are also truly exceptional and they manage to spook you, without having to rely on heavy prosthetics and rotting flesh.Secondly, the cinematography is amazing. Although the whole story is taking place during daytime, the film manages to make you feel claustrophobic and constantly nervous without having to rely on cheap tricks such as jump scares or low lighting conditions. The cuts are seamless, the colours great and, though different from Hollywood standards, it is a generally really good looking movie.What really captured me though in this film was the drama. In this genre the characters are usually very generic and one dimensional. Though this flick is, at first, not so different in this aspect, as the story carries on we witness the shifting between the dynamics of the characters, we see their personalities evolve and change, we find out about their motives, their relationships and the depths they would go for their loved ones. I personally found myself very emotionally invested to the characters (which might be due to the great acting performances),I was actively routing for them and was really moved by the movie's finale.Don't get me wrong though. This is not some melodramatic drama flick. It is still an awesome zombie apocalypse movie. It is fast paced, it is action-packed, it is gory, it is tense and terrifying and it will keep you at the edge of your seat. It is also original, it doesn't play around and will surely satisfy even the hardcore fans of the genre. However, it is also a film you will remember for its awesome story and characters and for being an overall great movie. 10/10",Train to Busan
860,janlakic,One of the best zombie movies i've ever seen,8,20 July 2017,If you liked zombie movie World War Z then you will definitely like that one even more. The storyline is very good 9/10 Zombies are very realistic. IF you love fear and anxiety that movie is for you. Would definitely recommend to anyone.,Train to Busan
861,cyphnd,Spoiler alert this movie is awful,1,16 October 2016,"Yes we have all seen zombie movies blah blah blah... but what grabs me in a movie is the fine line between smart characters, dumb characters, the ones that should die, and the ones you never guessed would die so soon. Basically all the characters are dumb.What do you do when you find out zombies cant see in the dark but are attracted to sound on a train? (Raises hand) I know! Crawl through the luggage compartments...... stupid. Things like this happen constantly in this movie Zombies are rushing your way what do you do? Stand there and stare at each other then run at the last minute. Or how about the time the main character closed the door on the pregnant couple when clearly he didn't have to close the damn door right away, but that just shows that he actually is a careless butt hole. Then the fat guy holds off a horde of zombies by himself and trying to shut a door while the other two dummies are trying to break in the opposite end. No common sense, they could help the fat guy first than worry about the next thing. mind you one of them even tried to call his girlfriend who was on the opposite side of the door. This movie has tons of moments were I just wanted to kick my TV in and toss it out the window. My friends and I were constantly chanting ""just die. Everyone just f****ING die."" The acting sucked, the little girl was the best act in the movie. Good job little girl, everyone else sucked. The funny part of the movie is when all the zombies somehow slowed down the locomotive, then when they get kicked off, you can clearly see that they're on some kind of ""boogie board"" bad way to spend money. I guess they didn't have enough money to just cgi that scene. I will never watch this movie again unless i want to sit somewhere and waste 2 hours of my life....... again.",Train to Busan

So i decided to watch it and it didn't disappoint me at all.It was actually VERY intense and sad. Intensity comes from tight space where you don't seem to have much options for escaping nor fighting back. Also I haven't cried from sadness about 13 years now and that movie totally broke the ice. So for that i am very thankful and 100% recommend. I rated it 10/10 because this movie contained everything.

I had heard good things about the movie, so I had to see it for myself. The movie has a bit of a spooky start to it. If you're wanting to go see a happy go lucky or romantic movie, this is NOT it. However, if you're looking for an action thriller that won't stop til the end, this is it. The funny thing is that this movie also has a incredibly sentimental, heart-breaking scene. Suffice it to say that one of the messages of the movie is to spend more time with your kids. Because the day may come when you're unable to spend time with them, even if you wanted to.

Its a shame that's all they saw and missed a fantastic movie in a genre that is well overly saturated with hot expensive garbage. Granted it's story told many times with character archetypes used again and again in the past, but here it's done almost perfectly. You start to love the people here trying to survive, cry when they pass, and cuss at the screen when the villains get there way. Great acting, diaolog, and cinematography. If you love this genre then please watch this movie. Can't wait for the sequel.Also check out Kingdom on Netflix. Korea really has a handle on zombie drama😆👍🤘",Train to Busan
872,MinusEleven,A Great Action Thriller,10,13 October 2018,"Train to Busan is a pleasure to watch. It takes the classic pandemic zombie and combines it with the isolated environment of a speeding train to great effect. The pandemic/contagion element is interwoven with ideas of environmentalism and morality. Trapping the characters in an enclosed space with the monster creates tension and conflict in a way that is somewhat reminiscent of a science fiction movie set on a spaceship or an action movie set on a submarine. These elements converge as tensions rise and the movie turns to exploring the darkest, as well as the most selfless, parts of human nature in the way that post-apocalyptic movies seem to do so well.This ideological framework is brought to life by some fantastic acting and great character writing that really draws you into the movie. The cinematography and visual storytelling are exceedingly well done and create a distinctive atmosphere. This is a movie that feels like it was built off of many well crafted details.Train to Busan isn't particularly gorey or terrifying and leans more towards the action/thriller category. It creates intrigue through the failings of the characters and humanity as a whole as well as the hope for redemption. Although the movie becomes a little ""over the top"" towards the end, it doesn't prevent this movie in being 10/10.",Train to Busan

878,arjunsn,Top tier,9,13 September 2018,"I've seen my fair share of zombie flicks and this one's up there with the greats, easily. 
The zombies in the this movie's are so brutal and portrayed in such a unique way. It never gets boring. Not for a moment. (Some damn good pacing)
The acting from the entire ensemble is on point. Totally sold me on their performance.
There was some moments where the lead characters had to make some pretty difficult choices. That kinda thing always happens in a zombie film, but they dealt with it a fresh way and me care for these characters even more.
The best thing about the movie's the hordes and hordes of zombies! And when talking about a zombie movie, it feels so refreshing to say that. (I wonder how many extras it took to get that many zombies)I also want to mention something which is so important to me in a horror movie: Subtlety.
There were scenes where zombies or the infected would just hang around in the back of the screen, sometimes not even in focus and the camera would just glance over it. That makes it so much more real and scary. It's nail biting from start to finish and completely worth your time. Go for it!
And just when I thought this genre had finally gone stale...
Train to Busan is currently Korea's 9th top grossing domestic movie of all time and I can definitely see why!
What a movie.",Train to Busan

881,soumayaghayate,One of the best Zombies movie!!,10,8 January 2018,"Train To Busan, it's a south korean horror film, directed by Yeon Sang-ho. it lasted 118min ( it's one of the best 118min in my life Xd ). This movie is set in South Korea!
It started with Seok-Woo ( Gong Yoo ) who accepted his doughter's request, which is to take her to Busan to see her mother, because it's Su-An's birthday ( Well.. Su-An is the daughter:) ).. But the journey has been disrupted by a hellish on-board zombie outbreak.. And the real story begins... Who will survive? and How?
I think that it is more than a horror movie, because it shows how selfish, greedy a human can be... And It makes you realize how precious your father is. He is the one who will make many sacrifices for you when no-one will.. 
The ending was especially well-done and sentimental. A child who saved lives through her singing.. Which make me realize that music makes us feel secure..
Overall, ' Train To Busan ' is the best Zombie movie ( It's exciting, emotional and heartbreaking ) with a good child actor! Also the performances are convincing...
If you are a Zombie fan, you should definitly give this movie a try ;).",Train to Busan

This film had such a good and believable atmosphere, it had the ability to make me feel anxious, angry, scared and sad all at the same time. The characters are well written and the story is good. When i wasn't on the edge of my seat I was crying. I love this movie and have seen it many times now. It never fails to make me cry.

On several occasions I have seen so bad acting that I had to roll the film in advance because it was a shame to watch it.

No, not your real scissors; abstract scissors, scissors of the mind. Imagine all of your preconceived opinions about this blood-filled zombie flick. Snip Snip. Forget them. This movie is chalk full of creativity, colourful character setups and fist-pumping zombie fighting action. Not to mention a few heart pumping scenes where a wrong step could mean instant lunch for a hungry pack of flesh eaters.The ordinary people thrust into a claustrophobic zombie train scenario was fantastic and lead to some very tense moments I never thought I would see in a zombie film. And seriously, just imagine that horrifying scenario. Being stuck in the zombie-infested passenger car of a train going 100+ miles per hour. Throw that train safety video out the window because nothing could ever prepare you for this mess.Fantastic performances with a few exceptions, surprisingly good cinematography and Korean melodrama fit for a zombie apocalypse. The good outweighs the bad here and that's all I can really ask for in a Korean zombie film because it means their is a potential for more.8/10 zombie thumbs up",Train to Busan

Aside from the zombie grappling action scenes which were pretty cliched, the truly compelling characters and the interactions between them is what makes this film a 10 for me.
The fractured relationship between the overworked 'arsehole' dad and his despondent daughter as he begrudgingly escorts her on the train to Busan so she could see her mother on her birthday, the two old ladies who have clearly been close friends for life, the true arsehole of the film who's only interest is his personal wellbeing, the possibly schizophrenic tramp, who people look upon as undesirable but grows in character and regard as the film progresses, and many others. But the star of this film is the little girl who is so expressive her story is written on her face and through the body language she has with her father and the people she meets on the train. 
 This film is pretty cheesy on the face of it, I mean what would you expect from a Korean zombie film. But It goes without saying such well developed characters in such a desperate situation lays bare in the most explicit way, human nature, the good and the bad. And some scenes will have even the most hardened hearts having to fight off a tear or two.",Train to Busan
888,hristihomeboy,"So I've never been the biggest fan of zombie films so I decided to give them another chance and look up some of the ""best"" of them online.",8,12 June 2018,"Seok-woo (played by Gong Yoo) is a divorced fund manager who tries to have a relationship with his estranged daughter. Due to his workaholic nature he rarely sees and talks to his daughter so when she asks him to go to Busan to visit her mother for her birthday he reluctantly accepts. They board the train and depart. However right before the train sets off a strange looking woman enters it seemingly running away from something and with a bite wound on her leg. We soon see that she has been infected with something and she starts attacking the train attendant. After that chaos ensues and we see the people that have not been infected try to move to the front of the bus to evade the zombies. We are introduced to Sang-hwa and his pregnant wife Seong-kyeong, a high school baseball team, the person we will all love to hate Yon-suk, two elderly sisters In-gil and Jon-gil nd and homeless man.My favorite character was definitely Sang-hwa. I absolutely loved him as a character and he was the type of character that you would love as a person and not just a fictional character. The main character was not as interesting for me but it was really enjoyable watching him turn into a totally different character and grow throughout the movie. The acting overall was great and the actors really made for feel worried for them especially the little girl.As someone who usually dislikes zombie films this movie really surprised me in the best way possible. The story and cinematography were amazing, the pacing was done perfectly and the setting was the ideal place for this kind of movie. It really brought out the feeling of claustrophobia and hopelessness as the people were just one door away from a horde of zombies. The drama in the movie was also very good and watching the people deal with the situation as well as deal with themselves was very entertaining.If I had to point out the things I disliked about the film it would probably be the cliches. There were a few cliche characters that you would expect in a movie like this which were annoying at parts. There were also a few plot points which I disliked that seemed to be only there to make you feel a certain way about certain events and characters.Still the movie was far, far more enjoyable than I expected and I am very glad that I decided to watch it.

Writing was poor and I felt like watching a movie instead of living an adventure, some scenes just were so unbelievable to me.An other critisim would be it's not smart enough to be a thriller and not scary enough to be horror. Something an other great Koreanen flick did achieve, the wailing. Other greats such as 28 days later and the old g.a.
