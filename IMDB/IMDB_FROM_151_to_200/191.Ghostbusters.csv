0,TheLittleSongbird,Every bit as awful as the terrible advertising suggested,1,23 July 2016,"The original 'Ghostbusters' is still enormously enjoyable entertainment, that fares even better from an adult perspective. The sequel was a step-down and not as good, but it has enough to make it watchable.'Ghostbusters' (2016), coming from somebody who has seen the film and saw it with an open mind, was a complete and utter mess. To be honest, expectations were extremely low, it was a terrible idea from the start, it had some of the most terrible advertising of any film in recent memory, the practical war-zone online from both sides but especially defenders was reason alone to put me off seeing it and hearing the theme song was enough to make one squirm.However, there are plenty of films out there that are badly advertised but actually turn out to be good to great films (for example, was expecting to dislike 'Lilo and Stitch' and 'Galaxy Quest', for examples, but ended up really liking and loving them respectively). Plus Melissa McCarthy, Kristen Wiig and Chris Hemsworth have given good to great performances in the past. So this reviewer gave it the benefit of the doubt and made a real effort to judge it as its own entity.It turned out to be every bit as awful as the advertising made it look. It's a disgrace to the original film but is a truly bad film on its own as well. Other than the spirited and reasonably entertaining performance of Cecily Strong, there is next to nothing about 'Ghostbusters'.Visually, it's not pleasing at all, with the incomplete-looking editing and very artificially cartoonish special effects particularly standing out in a bad way. The music is generic and over-bearing, the theme song also has to be down there as one of the worst theme songs in film history.Whereas the original 'Ghostbusters' has a great blend of comedy, horror and action, the reboot completely fails at all three. The horror is practically non-existent, there's too little and it's severely diluted by heavy overload of unintentional comedy, increasing predictability and lack of suspense and such. Action, if any, is barely noticeable.Especially pitiful is the comedy, which suffers from being continually forced and contrived jokes-wise and a severe lack of wit in the script. The references to the original could have been affectionate, but felt thrown-in and forced. It's not for the easily offended either, the backlash against the film has veered on misogynistic admittedly but with its subtlety-of-an-axe, obnoxious and racist and sexist stereotypes (especially Leslie Jones' offensive, irritating and out of date character and the depiction of men) the film is every bit as guilty.Story is paper thin, and when there is any it feels so rushed and incomplete that sense is next to zero, charm, heart and fun are all in the minus figures and the incomprehensibility factor is high. The direction is lethargic at best and inept at worst, chemistry between the actors is barely there, you couldn't have asked for a more pathetic or lamer villain and apart from Strong the acting is poor all round. Hemsworth has been described by some as a bright spot, but to me his scenes do slow down the film and the character is so much of a dumb dope with no likability that Hemsworth's easy-going charm, comic timing and swaggering charisma do not come through and he just grates. What a shameful waste of talent.The four leads either phone in (especially a bored-looking McCarthy) or over-act, particularly Kate McKinnon. The less said about obnoxious Leslie Jones the better. Wiig fares best, but isn't enough to save it. Don't rely on the cameos or the supporting roles to give an entertainment or nostalgia factor, they are just an excuse to cram as many as possible and nearly all of them consist of wasted talent actually looking as if they were bribed into taking part, while they are placed very clumsily most of the time too. The return of some of the actors in the original 'Ghostbusters' add nothing, they have screen times too short and look miserable.Overall, a pointless and awful reboot that improves nothing on the idea, that screamed of disaster from the get go, or the terrible advertising. 1/10 Bethany Cox",Ghostbusters
1,Leofwine_draca,Should never have been made,3,9 June 2018,"I admit from the start that I'm a massive fan of the original GHOST BUSTERS, although the sequel isn't so hot. Both films look like absolute classics compared to this ill-advised reboot of the series, recasting with an all-female ghostbusting team. Although the film looks similar to the original movies, it feels absolutely NOTHING like them. Gone is the character interplay and genuinely funny and droll performances that could be enjoyed by kids and adults alike; it's replaced by the kind of modern-day sarcasm and idiocy that I always end up hating. The new cast members are all unlikeable, and the likes of Kristen Wiig and Melissa McCarthy seem to be competing as to who can be the most irritating of the lot. Yes, the new-fangled CGI effects are very colourful and pretty, but they don't have any of the character and finesse of the old effects, which you knew were hard to do thus all the more impressive. The plot is as predictable as they come, and the only person who raised the occasional smile was Chris Hemsworth. I'm afraid the new GHOSTBUSTERS should never have been made.",Ghostbusters
2,SnoopyStyle,limited laughs,6,21 October 2016,"When ghosts show up in New York, who do you call? Erin Gilbert (Kristen Wiig) is looking to get tenure at Columbia. She tries to hide her previous work in the paranormal but her former partner and high school friend Abby Yates (Melissa McCarthy) has republished their book. With quirky engineer assistant Jillian Holtzmann (Kate McKinnon), Abby has continued the ghostly research. They finally discover a ghost and get kicked off the campus. Subway worker Patty Tolan (Leslie Jones) follows Rowan North to find him planting a device to attract a ghost. Patty joins the ghostbusters and they hire Kevin Beckman (Chris Hemsworth) as their hot dim-witted receptionist.There are limited laughs. The girls aren't maximizing the comedy. Hemsworth as a mimbo is worth a couple of chuckles. McKinnon is fine as a weirdo. Leslie Jones is great. There is potential between McCarthy and Wiig. The problem is that they start off wrong. Wiig recounts a childhood story which could have worked much better as a flashback. It would set the duo off on a much better footing. The group works well enough and there are plenty of ghostly action. Most of the cameos don't work except maybe Ernie Hudson. Overall, there needs to be more funny jokes.",Ghostbusters
3,Horst_In_Translation,Saturday Night Live - The Movie,4,12 June 2017,"""Ghostbusters"" is an American movie from 2016 and this made quite some waves as it is the newest movie about the world's most famous ghost hunting agency. They intentionally did not say it is a sequel or remake, but just another film that takes place in the same universe. And actually the story here is so different compared to the old Bill Murray movie that it would not have made any sense. It is not just about the protagonists being women this time, but also about motivations, backgrounds and eventually also the ghosts of course. They made some interesting decisions as this film felt on many occasions as one of its main challenges was to not make the fans of the original film angry as it really worked as a tribute with the mention of the song, the spray painting of the logo or other references as well. You will recognize them when you see them. And another approach in keeping the fans calm is to include the original actors in cameos and this is done here too. Oscar nominees Aykroyd, Weaver and Murray of course are all on board and play pretty small characters that are not really significant, but it gives the film a bit of an aura that the old cast approves.The director here is Paul Feig and he is also one of the writers. I think that there are segments when he did a good job and that there are segments when he didn't. He worked with Melissa McCarthy on several occasions in the past already and here we already have the name of one of the Oscar-nominated actresses in here. The other would be Kristen Wiig who is somewhat in the center playing the main character if you can say that even. And then there is Kate McKinnon and (for diversity) Leslie Jones. If you read these names, perhaps you will also understand the title of my review as these are all actresses who have appeared on Saturday Night Live, 3 of them actually as regulars, so it is a bit of a family affair. Anyway, the first half was solid if you manage to ignore some really bad jokes when the film hit rock-bottom when Melissa McCarthy (who else) talks about farting out of a vagina. Guess she always needs a bit of fecal humor in her works and it really hurts the overall material. You may think that with the bad guy gone around the 90-minute mark the film could be over, but of course it is not. Actually in the extended edition, the one I saw, it runs for a massive 2 hours and 14 minutes a lot of which are closing credits however. But still, some cutting it short probably would not have hurt the film as towards the end, it almost feels a bit of a collection of huge special effects and explosions and ghosts everywhere, but it does not reach the fun factor it tries to. For all I care, they don't need to make another Ghostbusters film with this cast and crew as this first one we have here was ultimately nothing special really and I give it a thumbs-down. Neither the performances nor the script not the comedy were really on a level that I would call memorable. Cannot recommend checking it out.",Ghostbusters
4,Prismark10,Reversing the polarity,5,12 July 2016,"When Harold Ramis died so did the notion of Ghostbusters 3 ever getting off the ground. Columbia Pictures instead rebooted the film for a new generation with a whole new team of female Ghostbusters and nods to the original such as Marshmallow Man and Slimer.Of course some people on the internet have not been too keen on this version from the get go. However the film is self aware of the backlash as Melissa McCarthy's character takes note of the YouTube video comments: 'Ain't no bitches gonna hunt no ghosts.'This version takes a while to get going after a spooky pre credit segment. McCarthy's Abby Yates plays the co-author of a ghost book who has been tracking the paranormal phenomenon for years. Kirsten Wiig's Erin Gilbert who also co- authored the book wants her spooky past forgotten as she strives for tenancy in academia.However when ghosts start to show up in Manhattan they spring into action along with Kate McKinnon as Jillian Holtzmann, an expert on tech gadgets and Leslie Jones as Patty Tolan, a transport worker who joins the team as the only non physicist as part of the new Ghostbusters and mirrors Ernie Hudson's role in the original who also the non physicist Ghostbuster.The final segment was full on Ghostbustin but it was also too much filled with CGI in a sound-stage that was a replica of Times Square from four decades or so. I felt something was off in the editing of that segment only for it to show up during the end credits.The original Ghostbusters was a mega hit back in 1984 but the sequel under performed with the critics and at the box office.This reboot is not bad, the plot is thin and McCarthy and Wiig rein in their shtick a bit. However I felt McKinnon tried too hard to be quirky. Other people have found Chris Hemsworth's turn as the male bimbo funny, I thought it was rather annoying.The film has the stars from the original Ghostbusters popping up as if to give it a seal of approval but although it has some genuinely spooky moments it is short on comedy.",Ghostbusters
5,claudio_carvalho,Unfunny Destruction of the 1984 Cult-Comedy,3,2 April 2017,"""Ghostbusters"" (2016) is one of the worst remakes ever made and an unfunny destruction of the 1984 cult-comedy. This female version is terrible with awful performances of the four humorless overrated lead actresses Melissa McCarthy, Kristen Wiig, Kate McKinnon and Leslie Jones that might work for stand-ups for American audiences, but have no capability to lead a worldwide blockbuster. Chris Hemsworth is not a bad actor and it is hard to understand why he accepted to perform the role of Kevin. Money probably (or certainly). Seth Rogen would be much more appropriate for this ridiculous role. The curriculum (or filmography) of the director and writer Paul Feig is enough to show who he is. The story is an atrocious combination of ""Ghostbusters"" and ""Godzilla"" with an absolutely annoying soundtrack. The only thing worthwhile are the state-of-art special effects. The cameo of countless people such as Sigourney Weaver, Andy Garcia, Ed Begley Jr., Charles Dance, Bill Murray, Ozzy Osbourne, Dan Aykroyd, Ernie Hudson, Elizabeth Perkins among others is a poor attempt of giving the fake status of cult to this garbage. Indeed a disrespect to the fans of the 1984 film. My vote is three.Title (Brazil: ""Caça-Fantasmas"" (""Ghosts Hunter"")",Ghostbusters
6,nogodnomasters,I hate to Debarge in,10,23 October 2017,"This is an effective and funny reboot and is not a sequel, although homage is paid to the original in cover music, logo, and cameos by Bill Murray, Sigourney Weaver, Dan Aykroyd, Ernie Hudson, Annie Potts, and the Stay-Puff Marshmallow man. Daniel Ramis, son of the late Harold Ramis also has a cameo.Melissa McCarthy has taken over the role of Bill Murray. Kristen Wiig replaces Dan Aykroyd, Kate McKinnon replaces Harold Ramis, Leslie Jones replaces Ernie Hudson, and Chris Hemsworth becomes the hapless receptionist Annie Potts. Steve Higgens plays the role of the dean for Higgens Institute. Ozzy Osbourne plays himself.If you enjoyed the first film, you will find enjoyment in the reboot. Classic Melissa McCarthy.Guide: No F-word, sex, or nudity.",Ghostbusters
7,kosmasp,Call back,8,25 February 2017,"Some people just know when and who to call. Some other people would argue that those people actually know nothing. And so this movie about Ghosthunters, who are also female in direct contrast to the original movies, where everyone was male, did divide the audience. Now a lot has been made about the gender of the leading characters and it shouldn't matter. If you like the movie and it's really silly humor, you won't mind anyway.And if you couldn't enjoy it, then it's a shame for you. The trailer should be an indicator though and if you thought it worked, than go ahead and give it a try. The women in this give it their best shot, Hemsworth is doing his best secretary spoof possible and has obviously a lot of fun all the time.We do have quite a few guest appearances, fans from the original should appreciate that.",Ghostbusters
8,Sleepin_Dragon,Yay for the woke brigade.,1,11 January 2021,"How on Earth I stayed the course for this one, is a mystery. What a dismal, awful, shocker of a film, unprofessional, intensely corny, and woefully unoriginal.There is a definite lack of originality, which is quite sad, as a kid I remember seeing the original, I collected the toys etc, it remains a a classic. The cast in that were perfectly chosen and balanced.Ghostbusters 2016 is the polar opposite of the original film, this is unoriginal, tired, unappealing, who on Earth would want any merchandise associated with this.Simply shoehorning in a female lead cast, gender swapping, for the sake of it, is lazy, it's woke, it does nothing for anyone. I am all for female led shows and movies, but please, make them original, don't just do the gender swap, can you imagine if Steel Magnolias was remade with an all male cast, there would rightly be carnage.Why on Earth did Charles Dance appear in this?It's dismal viewing. 1/10.",Ghostbusters
9,lee_eisenberg,"the movie is what it is, and you gotta admire them for it",8,23 July 2016,"First of all, I should make clear that Paul Feig's ""Ghostbusters"" is neither a sequel to nor remake of Ivan Reitman's version. It's more like an alternate version, with a female cast. As in the original version, there's a goof-off (Melissa McCarthy), a childlike character (Kate McKinnon), a no-nonsense type (Kristen Wiig) and a non-scientist (Leslie Jones), each using their talents to fight the evil spirits trying to take over New York. This version changes the story a little bit, but I enjoyed it. Naturally the CGI is more sophisticated - and sometimes so over-the-top that it's ridiculous - but I liked what I saw.No, the movie won't be for everyone (the previous reviewer didn't like it). But, if you're in for some plain old fun, then this new ""Ghostbusters"" is for you.",Ghostbusters
10,jboothmillard,Ghostbusters,5,23 July 2016,"Rumours had been circulating for years that there was going to be another sequel to the popular 1984 movie, but various circumstances meant it was decided there would be a reboot, I was willing to try it, despite it having the most disliked movie trailer of all time on YouTube, directed by Paul Feig (Bridesmaids, The Heat, Spy). Basically Dr. Erin Gilbert (Kristen Wiig) and Dr. Abby Yates (Melissa McCarthy) wrote a book together, about the assumed existence of paranormal phenomenon, specifically ghosts, the book proves unpopular. Years later, Gilbert has become a teacher at Columbia University, she finds out the book has been republished, it threatens her reputation, so she confronts Yates, who continues to study the paranormal at a technical college with eccentric engineer Dr. Jillian Holtzmann (Kate McKinnon). In exchange for ending publication of the book, Gilbert agrees to assist Yates and Holtzmann on a paranormal investigation, they witness and document a reported sighting, seeing a ghost reignites Gilbert's belief in the paranormal, but a video of them is posted online, they are dismissed from their teaching positions. To continue their research, they find an office above a Chinese restaurant, open the ""Department of the Metaphysical Examination"", hire handsome but dim-witted Kevin Beckman (Chris Hemsworth) as receptionist, and build equipment to study and capture ghosts. MTA worker Patty Tolan (Leslie Jones) witnesses a ghost herself in the subway, she contacts the Department, investigating they document the ghost, and successfully test Holtzmann's proton containment laser, but their proof is again dismissed. The group continue to develop their ghost containment technology and advertise their services, despite setbacks, and pundits start calling them the ""Ghostbusters"", Patty joins the team, to provide them with her historic knowledge of New York City and a vehicle dubbed ""Ecto-1"". Unbeknownst to them, occultist Rowan North (Neil Casey) is summoning the ghosts with his built devices, attempting to create an apocalypse, one of his devices is placed at a live music venue, but the Ghostbusters are called, and make their first successful capture of a dangerous spirit in front of hundreds of people. Supernatural debunker Dr. Martin Heiss (Bill Murray) demands proof of their work, Gilbert resents being labelled as insane or a liar, so releases the captured ghost from containment, it escapes, and throws Heiss out of the window. The Ghostbusters are brought to see Mayor Bradley (Andy Garcia), who has been trying to keep the city's ghost problem a secret, they are denounced publicly by him as frauds. The Ghostbusters discover the pattern of ghost appearances, Rowan is placing devices along ley lines, intersecting at the Mercado Hotel in Times Square, which has a history of paranormal activity, and there they discover in the hotel basement he has built a portal to the ghost dimension. Rowan electrocutes himself rather than be captured, the portal is deactivated, in Rowan's possessions a copy of Yates' book, his plan was to become a ghost and command the undead, he soon returns as a powerful spirit, possessing Kevin, and reactivates and opens the portal. Hundreds of ghosts are released, the city is thrown into darkness, the Ghostbusters fight their way through an army of various ghosts to reach the portal, Rowan takes the form of the Ghostbusters' logo, growing to an enormous height and destroying the city. The team devise a plan to use Ecto-1's nuclear reactor to cause a total protonic reversal, close the portal and return the ghosts to their dimension, the plan is successful, and Gilbert is able to rescue Yates from being dragged down. In the end, the Mayor continues denouncing the Ghostbusters, but privately offers to fund their research, and their headquarters is upgraded so they can deal with future paranormal threats, despite the smear campaign, New York lights up with praise and tributes for the Ghostbusters. Also starring Charles Dance as Harold Filmore, Michael Kenneth Williams as Agent Hawkins, Sigourney Weaver as Rebecca Gorin, Dan Aykroyd as Cabbie, Annie Potts as Desk Clerk, Ernie Hudson as Uncle Bill, Ed Begley Jr. as Ed Mulgrave and Ozzy Osbourne. McCarthy, Wiig, McKinnon and Jones are well picked for their characters, and all work well together, Hemsworth looks like he is having fun, and it is suitable to have small appearances from the original movie stars Murray, Weaver, Aykroyd, Hudson and Potts, even Slimer and the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man, the credits pay tribute to Harold Ramis. I questioned if the change of concept, with four women becoming the ghost-fighting team, could work, and I made pre-judgements what it may be like because of the critics, in fact I was pleasantly surprised, it made me laugh at the right moments, including when they get covered in slime (ecoplasm), it is also a jumpy at times, and the story is easy to follow, it might not be as witty as the original, but it is a good fun supernatural comedy. Worth watching!",Ghostbusters
11,Tweekums,A distaff reboot of an eighties classic,7,2 September 2019,"If like me you enjoyed the original film you are likely to go into this with some trepidation; now having watched this I'd say it isn't a classic but it still provided plenty of laughs and a few mild scares.Erin Gilbert is a physics professor at Columbia University on the brink of gaining tenure... then a book about ghosts which she and her college friend Abby Yates wrote as a joke years ago is reprinted; not something a serious scientist can be associated with. She goes to see Abby, who is now researching ghosts at a far less prestigious institution. They, along with Abby's research partner Jillian Holtzmann, go to a reported haunting; Erin's scepticism is ended when a ghost covers her in slime! Soon all of them are sacked but continue their ghost hunting. They are later joined by Patty Tolan, a subway worker and hire the less than capable Kevin Beckman to work as their receptionist. The number of sightings is increasing but, not wanting to cause a panic, the authorities claim it is all a hoax. The Ghost Busters continue their investigation and surmise that somebody is working to bring the ghosts to New York... things will get worse before they get better.I can understand why some fans of the original will really dislike this but I thought that, even though it wasn't as good, it still provided plenty of laughs and the central story was rather fun... although the antagonist was less menacing than the original's 'Zuul'. The characters are solid and work well together. Having the Ghost Busters changed to four women wasn't really necessary and may be seen as a nod to political correctness by some, but for me it wasn't a problem. Kristen Wiig and Melissa McCarthy are solid as Erin and Abby, two nicely different characters but it is Kate McKinnon steals many scenes as Jillian, who is a little too enthusiastic at times; especially when demonstrating new ghost busting devices. Leslie Jones provides some laughs as Patty and Chris Hemsworth is funny as dumb blond secretary, who was employed for his looks, Keven. The special effects are very good, making some scenes scary in a way that is suitable for youngsters. Overall I wouldn't call this a must see but I found it to be worth watching... is was certainly more than worth the twenty pence I paid for the DVD!",Ghostbusters

13,BA_Harrison,Spooktacularly bad.,2,12 February 2017,"Three scientists (Kristen Wiig, Melissa McCarthy, and Kate McKinnon) and a subway worker (Leslie Jones) form Ghostbusters, a team dedicated to ridding the world of unwanted spooks. The foursome have their work cut out for them when weirdo janitor Rowan North (Neil Casey) puts into motion his plan to unleash malevolent spirits on New York.I'm not a huge fan of the original Ghostbusters, so I wasn't at all outraged when they announced the remake/reboot, with—God forbid—a female cast. Despite the trailer not boding well, and terrible word of mouth on the film's release, I was willing to go in with an open mind. However, I'm sorry to say that the film is every bit the total (ghost)train wreck that I had heard it was, well deserving of all the hatred and scorn thrown its way.A terrible script loaded with extremely lame gags, four leads who share zero chemistry and who are not in the least bit funny (but very irritating), an extremely embarrassing supporting role for Chris Hemsworth (as dumb hunk receptionist Kevin), pointless cameos from stars of the original Ghostbusters (all of whom should have said 'No!'), and waayyyy too much CGI: Ghostbusters 2016 didn't have a ghost of a chance of succeeding.",Ghostbusters
14,paul_haakonsen,This was not a necessary movie by any means...,5,15 August 2016,"I must admit that it was with a certain amount of hesitation that I went into the cinema to watch this 2016 re-visit to the ""Ghostbusters"" franchise. Why? Well, first of all, you shouldn't meddle with a classic, and secondly why opt for an all female cast? And while the special effects and CGI in ""Ghostbusters"" were quite spectacular and visually a treat to look at, then that is about all that carried the movie. Yup, the special effects team were carrying the movie.As for the story, well, if you have seen any of the old classic ""Ghostbusters"" movies, then you have already essentially already seen the 2016 rendering. It was generic and quite unimpressive in terms of new ideas and creativity.I had hopes that Melissa McCarthy would be the selling point for me for this movie, but sadly that didn't come true. She wasn't really in her usual gear for this movie, and it just seemed that the rest of the cast were holding her back. I can't really claim to say that there were anything memorable in this 2016 version, aside from the special effects - as the ghosts actually looked pretty darned awesome. Well, perhaps Chris Hemsworth manages to strike a few laughs here and there with his offbeat character.It was a nice treat, though, to see most of the cast from the original ""Ghostbusters"" movie make very brief cameo appearances throughout the movie. Was it something that helped lift up the movie? Hardly so. It was just a nod of courtesy to the viewers who has stuck with the franchise since the first movie.My opinion of the 2016 version of ""Ghostbusters"" is that it is a visually impressive movie, and a movie that will have some appeal to a brand new audience who never had the chance to watch the original movies. But for us who grew up with the classics, then this 2016 version seems more like a slap to the face with a dead, cold fish.A very unnecessary re-make, and clearly one that put a beloved franchise through the money-making machine of re-makes that Hollywood sadly has turned into.All in all, ""Ghostbusters"" at the hand of director Paul Feig scores a very mediocre five out of ten stars from me.",Ghostbusters
15,tavm,This female-centric version of Ghostbusters is a mostly entertaining reboot of the original version from 32 years ago,7,19 July 2016,"After reading positive reviews from many critics and knowing of the negative comments from fans of the original 1984 version based on their viewing of the trailer for this current one, I decided to find out for myself with my movie theatre-working friend who said he enjoyed it when seeing it at an employee screening beforehand. Verdict: I actually liked this female-centric version of the now-classic that originally starred Bill Murray and was written by Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis, both of whom were the co-stars of that one. This version stars Melissa McCarthy and Kristen Wiig and both have some funny lines with nice support from Kate McKinnon and Leslie Jones. Oh, and the cameos of the various stars from that original were pretty amusing to see including the bust of one who passed away a few years ago. To tell the truth, it's been about 30 years since I last watched the original version and I don't know if this version would become a classic like that one. Still, this version of Ghostbusters is worth seeing whether you liked that other one or are just watching this particular version as the first time for any of them.",Ghostbusters

It was evident that the radical change they made is evidently the so-called gender change wherein now we have female ghost fighters instead of male ones. For another thing,we also get to see better CGI visual technology considering that they never existed more than 30 years ago when the original was made.It was apparent that women wants to show that they themselves are capable of taking care of the ghost. As usual, we get to see the theme of feminism in the picture. As for the studio,it is apparent that they made the movie to make a quick buck. Too bad that bringing back the original movies at present time with the gender change isn't enough. There is a great responsibilities for the remakes as comparisons to the originals will be make. And when it comes to comparison, it is evident that this film does not deliver. Despite the presence of capable female comediennes, we get to see that they don't deliver as they as they lack chemistry as ghost busters. In sense,it never stood to the original. But to its credit, it was better than the recently released Elizabeth Banks' ""Charlie's Angels"" as it is tried its best not to offend men.",Ghostbusters
17,studioAT,A new take on Ghostbusters!,5,29 December 2016,"Has a film ever received so much hate before it had even been released?! From the scorn that it featured an all female cast, to the negative comments about the trailer, Ghostbusters had a hard time before it even reached the screen.I wasn't a huge fan of the originals, so didn't go in thinking ""nothing can touch them"" like some fans did. Upon the film starting I was met with a decent storyline, and four funny women trying to create a different sort of Ghostbusters film that also doffed the cap to what had gone before.It's not a film I'd rush to see again. I found it a bit slow in parts, and preferred the moments where it was clear that the leading ladies had gone off script, but it was a decent enough film, and not one deserving so much negativity around it.",Ghostbusters

At this point the movie is so mired in controversy that any opinion on it seems like a political statement more than a movie review. But here we go anyway - I didn't like it. It feels less like a movie with an idea (in this case a recycled one) and more like one of the many subpar comedies we have today where a few comedians who are friends in real life get together and give us two hours of smug back-patting. It offers nothing memorable of its own, just a few reworked things from the original movie, which was a classic with many iconic images and scenes. The only thing anyone will remember about this is the controversy surrounding it. I don't care much for Melissa McCarthy or Leslie Jones but I do like Kristen Wiig and I'm trying very hard to like Kate McKinnon (perhaps too hard). None of these women are impressive here. Chris Hemsworth's character is used too much. It's an obvious joke that doesn't get funnier the more you tell it. Ultimately the problem with this movie isn't that ""women aren't funny,"" so much as comedy writers today are very lazy and uninspired.",Ghostbusters
20,zardoz-13,A Good Reboot!,8,26 July 2016,"Misogynists may not be the only ones that abhor the Sony/Columbia Pictures remake of director Ivan Reitman's vintage comedy ""Ghostbusters"" (1984) starring Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis, Ernie Hudson, and Sigourney Weaver. Some moviegoers hate remakes whether the films are good or bad, but 32 years have intervened since ""Ghostbusters"" came out and made a mint. ""Bridesmaids"" director Paul Feig, who has rebooted ""Ghostbusters,"" with Kristen Wiig, Melissa McCarthy, Kate McKinnon, and Leslie Jones as the eponymous protagonists, hasn't tampered with the formula that made the original so popular as much as he has retooled it for contemporary tastes. Aside from Bill Murray's shtick, the original ""Ghostbusters"" qualified as amusing, superficial hokum, but I cannot say my attitude toward its sophomoric slapstick has altered drastically over the years. I've always felt that Murray's other movies, such as ""Stripes,"" ""Groundhog Day,"" and ""Where the Buffalo Roan,"" were infinitely better. Meantime, the originality of Reitman's farce notwithstanding, Feig and his female cast have given the material a lively spontaneity , and the superior CGI special effects don't overshadow their shenanigans as much as it did the 1980s cast. Surviving original cast members make cameos, but they play completely different characters with no relation to anybody in the remake. Slimer and the Stay Puff Marshmallow Man reappear. Feig's ""Ghostbusters"" doesn't resuscitate plot lines or call back characters from the two earlier films, but approaches the material afresh as if nothing had occurred in the paranormal realm. Actually, this estrogen-engineered remake handles some of the proton-packing elements better than the original. Although the typically hilarious Kristen Wiig and Melissa McCarthy are uncharacteristically reserved, Kate McKinnon, Leslie Jones, and Chris Hemsworth take up the slack with spirit. ""Saturday Night Live"" alum Kate McKinnon will make you forget Dan Aykroyd, and Leslie Jones is a hoot and a holler in Ernie Hudson's role. Chris Hemsworth replaces Annie Potts, who played the original ""Ghostbusters"" receptionist, and Hemsworth steals many scenes as a clueless clown. While it clocks in approximately eleven minutes longer than the PG-rated ""Ghostbusters,"" the PG-13 rated remake remains largely similar. The biggest difference lies in the human adversary that the gals tangle with and the enlarged role that the New York City mayor exerts in this mischievous nonsense.The tomfoolery unfolds when a vengeful female ghost breaks out of a locked basement in the historic Aldridge Mansion in Manhattan and creates all sorts of havoc. Columbia University physics professor Erin Gilbert (Kristen Wiig of ""Bridesmaids"") is poised to achieve tenure when the desperate Aldridge Mansion caretaker calls upon her for her paranormal expertise. She is horrified when he shows her the book that she co-wr0te years ago entitled ""Ghosts from Our Past: Both Figuratively and Literally."" Erin realizes that this tome will discredit her in the eyes of her prestigious Columbia colleagues. Erin confronts her former colleague, Abby Yates (Melissa McCarthy), who conducts paranormal research at another university, about their book. Earlier, Erin convinced Abby to suppress their work, but Abby hopes that selling it on Amazon will yield another source of revenue to fund her own research. Unfortunately, not only does Columbia sack Erin, but Abby also loses her job. Abby's technical wizard of an assistant, Jillian Holtzmann (Kate McKinnon), serves as the equivalent of James Bond's gadget designer Q; Jillian has concocted an exotic arsenal of paranormal weaponry. Along the way, a fourth person joins their team, MTA employee Patty Tolan (Leslie Jones of ""Trainwreck""), who has had a close encounter with supernatural specter in a subway tunnel. Patty emerges as the most aggressive of the quartet when it comes to defying phantoms. Apart from aiding Erin, Abby, and Jillian with her unique knowledge of historic New York City, Patty is also able to acquire a hearse that they refit as their primary means of transportation, appropriately christened ""Ecto-1."" Next, these intrepid dames set-up their headquarters--Department of the Metaphysical Examination—in office space above a Chinese restaurant and promptly find themselves in brisk demand. At a punk rock concert, they prove their expertise when they capture a gigantic, gremlin-like apparition and trap it in a compact metal container. Eventually, our heroines figure out that all the ghost sightings are not random occurrences. Instead, they are the work of an insane occultist, Mercado Hotel janitor Rowan North (Neil Casey of ""Adult Beginners""), who is preparing to unlock that dreadful dimension between the living and the dead so that dead souls galore can migrate into our world. Rowan has manufactured several devices and concealed them throughout the city like land mines to summon these spectacular spooks. Meantime, when our heroic quartet isn't contending with the dastardly Rowan, they have to deal with fatuous New York City Mayor Bradley (Andy Garcia of ""Ocean's Thirteen"") who insists that they stand down and let Homeland Security handle the chaos. Ultimately, our heroines confront Rowan at his motel where they find his massive ghost machine. Rowan fries himself on his apparatus, and Bradley congratulates our heroines for finishing off this fiend. Unfortunately, this is part of Rowan's master plan. Now, he is able to operate out of a larger arena that was not available to him as a physical flesh and blood entity. Indeed, this giddy ""Ghostbusters"" remake is even more ambitious than its predecessor. During the last half-hour, our heroines take on a supernatural Macey's Day parade of ghouls. At one point, Slimer reappears with a Mrs. Slimer! Mind you, our heroines are properly equipped to deal with these demons. This new foursome boasts all kinds of ultra-cool armaments with which to dispatch these evil apparitions. Just like the original ""Ghostbusters,"" the ""Ghostbusters"" remake never takes itself seriously, but the cast maintains a straight face. Indeed, had Sony/Columbia Picture made this the third entry in the original franchise, it would have been a blast. Nevertheless, by rebooting the franchise with gals rather than guys, director Paul Feig has given ""Ghostbusters"" a new lease of life that it might otherwise have lacked.",Ghostbusters
21,oscaralbert,"My dad took my nephew, at age 6, to see this movie in 1984 . . .",8,21 July 2016,". . . when it was a Good Ol' American product, and it was said that a great time was had by all at a flick rating 5 stars (out of five). So I naively saw no reason why I should NOT take my own nephew, 7, to watch the new GHOSTBUSTERS. What could go wrong? The first image on the screen, slowly emerging from a dark murk, is a circular shape that morphs into ""Sony,"" the propaganda arm of the Japanese government, tasked with taking down America from within, as revenge for the U.S. military defeating Japan's War Criminals in the 1900s. This meant nothing, of course, to my nephew. But less than 10 minutes later, thanks to Japanese Tool Melissa McCarthy, the young lad is asking me ""How do girls fart from their fronts?"" Within half an hour Sony had me trying to explain ""face bidets,"" ""soiled slacks,"" and ""goo in every crack."" Taken as a whole, this summer's GHOSTBUSTERS is blatant Product Placement. The ""product"" is that Buffoonish Boor of Crudity himself, President Trump (whom Glen Beck has labeled as an ""extinction event for American Capitalism). As Fox ""News"" fires its founder Roger Ailes for trying to investigate the blood that President Trump said was spurting from Megyn Kelly's ""wherever,"" we can all thank Sony Pictures for corrupting America with its herd of filthy cinematic Trojan Horses.",Ghostbusters
22,george.schmidt,SlimeTime: Girls Just Wanna Have Fun,7,18 July 2016,"GHOSTBUSTERS (2016) **1/2 Melissa McCarthy, Kristen Wiig, Kate McKinnon, Leslie Jones, Chris Hemsworth, Andy Garcia, Cecily Strong, Neil Casey, Charles Dance, Ed Begley, Jr. , Zach Woods, Michael Kenneth Williams, Matt Walsh, Karan Soni, Steve Higgins, Bess Rous, Nate Corddry (Cameos: Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Annie Potts, Ernie Hudson, Sigourney Weaver; Ozzy Osbourne (as himself) ) Much ballyhooed remake/reboot to the smash hit blockbuster '80s sci-fi comedy with a sex change works for the most part with a fiercely funny foursome of McCarthy, Wiig, McKinnon and Jones as the paranormal quartet setting up shop in NYC where yet again another apocalyptic event is cooking no thanks to a disgruntled native (Casey) who is about to unleash a seismic spookiest of biblical proportions. While filmmaker Paul Feig (who co-scripted with partner-in-crime Katie Dippold) has the chops comedically down set many of the pulse beats are retreads or touchstones to the original classic (which is well and good; you can't please everyone including the haters) yet even despite using more practical visuals succumbs to CGI overload in a bloated grande finale that feels like Roland Emmerich leftovers from ID4. At any rate the girls just wanna have fun (McKinnon is a hoot as a combo of Yahoo Serious (seriously at least in her off-beat get ups) and Aykroyd & Ramis' characters while McCarthy & Wiig have a dynamite back-and-forth schism of natural on point low-key hilarity) adds up to some solid laughs amidst slime time and prove chemistry outweighs a few potholes in the film (what is with all the Shouting? Ms. Jones is always a large goofy presence but at times Everyone is up one decibel than necessary and a game Hemsworth attempts to be humorous but his stupid receptionist is oddly sexist considering the ongoing backlash about the sex change in the protagonists; oh well so much for progress). And yes the original members (sans Rick Moranis and a nice visual tribute to the late, great Harold Ramis) show up in lackluster cameos; nice try from the producers.",Ghostbusters
23,neil-476,Good fun,8,15 July 2016,"Let me say right at the start that I thoroughly enjoyed this. I found it funny and escapist, and a completely reasonable reboot. I thought it was an enjoyable, entertaining movie. End of review.My word, there is some agenda-driven poison in many of the comments here. The original movies haven't been destroyed: they are still there, so you can watch them if you didn't like this one. And as for the man-hating - which of the male characters in the original were so great? Much of the criticism here is just as unfair as the pre-release hostility.Go and see it with an open mind - it's fun. If you can't manage an open mind then don't go and see it - spare yourself, and spare us.",Ghostbusters
24,AlsExGal,You'll never get rich...,4,14 December 2019,".... to quote a good Columbia (Sony) film from the classic era, trashing the fans before the film even comes out. But that was what Sony did when they got a negative reaction from their trailers and could see the train wreck that was coming that would be the release of this film.The humor in this film is very forced, broad, and silly, where the original Ghostbusters film featured dry intelligent humor often coming from just who the characters were and how they interacted.The villain was just awful. He seemed like he was yanked straight out of a cartoon or comic book. The scene at the rock concert - which is shown in trailers - is just goofy. It was like I was watching live action Scooby Doo. Throwing a story into the middle of a concert never really bodes well unless you want to conjure up images of rubber suited turtles doing the 'ninja rap'.And last but not least, this film has absolutely zero problem defying the rules that are established. Proton beams hold the ghosts, the traps capture them until they're ready to be shoved off into a containment unit. They follow the same rules throughout most of the film, but then near the end, the Ghostbusters start using proton beams as if they were able to destroy ghosts, gunslinger style. What the??Because there are fans of this franchise going back 35 years, history matters. And this installment just destroyed all of that. This is not the worst film ever made, but it is definitely not worth your time.",Ghostbusters
25,anaconda-40658,A Worthy Ghostly Reboot.,8,21 July 2016,"Ghostbusters (2016): Dir: Paul Feig / Cast: Kristen Wiig, Melissa McCarthy, Kate McKinnon, Leslie Jones, Chris Hemsworth: All female update of the classic monster comedy, Ghostbusters. This is a stand alone film that never succeeds the original but is a far cry from the mess that Ghostbusters 2 was. Kristen Wiig plays Erin Gilbert who wrote a book on ghosts with Abby Yates, played by Melissa McCarthy. Erin prefers to shade that experience in event of a possible promotion while Abby is shacked away with Jillian Holtzmann inventing weapons to fight the paranormal. Jillian is played by Kate McKinnon who steals scenes with sarcasm and bewilderment. Leslie Jones plays Patty Tolan who works at the subway where she has a paranormal encounter. Upon meeting Erin, Abby and Jillian she decides to join them and rigs up her uncles hearse with the Ghostbusters logo. Chris Hemsworth is hilarious as the newly hired secretary who hasn't two clues in his head. Director Paul Feig tries to bring together what worked originally combined with a screenplay that contains tense moments as well as a lot of humour. Many of the original cast appear in cameos while many of the original ghosts including Slimer and Mr. Stay Puff make appearances. The special effects lack the originality of the first film but they still manage to dazzle even when the Ghostbusters logo produces a giant problem. Wiig is dosed in slime twice and we cannot help but enjoy the memories. Some are opposed to its female approach but this reboot still produces lots of proton beams, ghastly images and green slime.

Ghostbusters is a very entertaining, albeit popcorn flick.It's extremely funny at times, though the nature of the film restricts it somewhat. Kristen Wiig and Leslie Jones mostly make it work. I don't see how other reviewers are referring to Melissa McCarthy as the lead, when Wiig plays the only integral character and most definitely is. Holtz's overdone and a tad annoying, not enough to kill the enjoyment though.",Ghostbusters
27,FlashCallahan,There's a goat on the loose.....,9,18 July 2016,"People who are easily led by the majority, please don't believe the unmitigated hate this film has received since it was green lit with an all female cast. Bear in mind it's produced by the original Director, and Exec produced by Ackroyd.And it's really surprising to know that it's one of the most entertaining reboots/remakes/side-quels of a beloved classic from our childhood.Two paranormal researchers join forces with a nuclear engineer and a subway attendant to fight off a slew of ghosts that have invaded New York City. Eventually, they come face-to-face with an evil entity who can control human beings........The reason why the film works so well is that it simply just follows the template of the original movie, but with different settings and characters. So as the original started with the woman being followed around the library, here we have a tour guide with exactly the same expression on his face as the title graces our screen.And the final set piece more than resembles the finale of the original, funnily enough with a little of Donner's Superman 2 added for good measure.The blatant sexist hate for this film is absolutely abhorrent, and it's such a shame that. Any people have jumped on the same bandwagon, in fear of getting ridiculed for being different, much like the protagonists of the film in question.Wiig is wonderful, and the first twenty minutes of this film is laugh out loud hilarious. The first encounter the Ghostbusters experience is hilarious and very scary to boot.Hemsworth almost steals the show from everybody as Kevin, and the first interview is priceless. If you don't laugh at least once, especially by the name of his dog, you are either lying, on that poisonous bandwagon, or devoid of humour.Yes his character is stupid, and is used just for comedy, but he is a natural at comedy, and I hope he makes a few more.The effects are really good, quite intense in some scenes, but I urge you to see this in 3D, it really enhances the action scenes, and some of it is used to really good effect.The cameos are a wonderful inclusion to the film, and they all add a little to the film rather than having them more or less saying 'hey!!! We were in the old one!!! Remember us??'.It does run out of steam toward the end, and the villain is nothing more than a bitter man who was bullied as a child (his character really needed to be fleshed out), and Jones does suffer from being the token stereotype thanks to some poor script decisions.But fear not, the reboot of one of the most iconic films from 1984 isn't nowhere near as bad as what you have been told, and what you are led to believe.It's lively, funny, scary and most importantly, doesn't try to outdo the original.And thank goodness one cameo now has a partner.Don't believe the hate, it's a great summer movie, and they are really short on the ground this year..",Ghostbusters
28,deloudelouvain,Please make Melissa McCarthy stop acting,4,8 February 2017,"I will never get why you have to remake a movie if it is not to make it better. It's been a long time since I saw the Ghostbusters from 1984 but I know for sure that I liked that one better. Why would you spend so much money to a movie that is already been made before and even better? I really don't get it. This remake is painful to watch. The only decent comedian was Leslie Jones. At least she was a bit funny. But Melissa McCarthy, she's a total nightmare to watch. Why people like her as a comedian is a mystery to me. Her humor level is at zero point zero and the most annoying thing about her is her extremely irritating voice. Kate McKinnon and Chris Hemsworth were also a nightmare to watch. The special effects would have been good for 1984 but not for 2016. I so wished I would have watched the first Ghostbusters again instead of this failure.",Ghostbusters
29,Mr-Fusion,The negative hype is ridiculous,7,16 July 2016,"(Updated 10/22/16) Three months after the fact and ""Ghostbusters"" (sadly) isn't as funny as it was in the theater. It's absolutely not as bad as the Internet would like you to believe, and (again, sadly) has become the most politicized thing I've seen in a very long time. But there's also something very bland about the movie, from the four main characters right down to the soundtrack. And this is speaking strictly as a moviegoer. It didn't have to take any chances, but a lot of the jokes are also very obvious. And Murray and Aykroyd got the shaft in the cameo department.But my wife very much enjoyed the movie, regardless of these reasons; and my daughter got to the end credits and asked, ""Aww, why does it have to be over?"" They've really taken to this, and that's really who the movie's aiming for anyway. I like that my kid has a movie where women are Ghostbusters, and my appreciation for it brightens as a result.

You didn't already know the plot, the effects were reasonable, you might have even gotten past the toilet slapstick humor that was used all over the place. Cult classic it would not have been, but you would have liked it.Fast forward to our time and you have a movie that brings nothing new, removes of the actual humor in the original and replaces the original cast with women, because girls rule and women as funny. You already know the story, none of the characters have anything relatable (probably not even for women, but I wouldn't know) and everything else, from the villain to the action, sucks.First of all, one cannot reboot a franchise by assuming the original did not exist at all to compare with. Second of all, I know smart and funny women and they are not at all like the creatures this film depicts.So yeah, it was a ghost movie.

Comparisons are bound to happen & the classic with Bill Murray & Co. created a magical world of humor & heroism, but lets not even think to underestimate the women in charge this time. Led by Kate McKinnon's show-stealing turn, the women catch the ghosts without, getting lazy.""Ghostbusters' Synopsis: Following a ghost invasion of Manhattan, paranormal enthusiasts Erin Gilbert and Abby Yates, nuclear engineer Jillian Holtzmann, and subway worker Patty Tolan band together to stop the otherworldly threat.I enjoyed 'Ghostbusters' because it gets the casting right. McKinnon is hilariously stunning as the funny & least scared Ghostbuster, who's body-language & sense of timing leave you compelled. She's irresistible. Melissa McCarthy & Kristen Wiig are comic icons & its no surprise, that their deadpan delivery proves to be a major highlight. Leslie Jones also delivers, despite screaming. And special mentions for Chris Hemsworth as the dim-witted receptionist of the women in charge & Andy García who's every bit of the shrewd mayor of the city, who refuses to believe in the women. The Original Ghostbusters Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd & Ernie Hudson (with the spirit of the Late/Great Harold Ramis watching them over) appear in brief bits. And so does Sigourney Weaver in a post-credits cameo. And that's all done in a funny, entertaining way.Paul Feig & Katie Dippold's Screenplay blends comedy with ghost hunting scares, aptly. The Writing isn't perfect, but it doesn't fall over the place & never underwhelms in pressure. Feig's Direction is good, once again. Cinematography, Editing, The Art & Costume & The Graphics, all, are well-done.Final Word? 'Ghostbusters' is actually pretty good fun.",Ghostbusters

Still I give a half thumbs up as this film was funny with one liners and it tried a little bit of parody, and I still think that Kristen Wiig, Leslie Jones, Mrs. McCarthy and Kate McKinnon are fine and very funny actresses still this effort seemed restrained as the monsters don't compare to the original as the use of FX and 3D doesn't sharpen it up none.

33,lasttimeisaw,an uninspired reinvention of the original story with a vital and relevant gender-swapping,6,23 August 2016,"The rebooted GHOSTBUSTERS is a reinvention out of the original story written by Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis, with a vital and relevant gender-swapping. And each member of the foursome posse has passed the appraisal as genuine comedienne thanks to their Saturday Night Live stint, not to mention Melissa McCarthy is presently THE most bankable US comedienne in the movie business, which has been kick-started by director Paul Feig's BRIDESMAIDS (2011).In the remake, Erin Gilbert (Wiig), a tenured-to-be physics professor at Columbia University rekindles her passion for paranormal activities when she has to confront her school-day bestie Abby Yates (McCarthy), now a maverick researcher, for publishing the book which they wrote together about the existence of that particular subject matter years ago, behind her back. They meet a real ghost in a haunted house which thrusts them to form a ""Ghostbuster"" team to catch ghosts, with the participation of the technophile Jillian Holtzman (McKinnon) and the street-smart subway worker Patty Tolan (Jones, not a latecomer like Ernie Hudson in the original, she is a loudmouth and her presence is ubiquitous), who offers them a hearse-revamped automobile, plus a dimwit eye-candy Kevin (Hemsworth, who is amazingly good in his goofy and flippant dash) as their inept secretary, whom, Erin has a crush on (and who doesn't? Maybe only Holtzman, but unfortunately the lesbian undercurrent never catches on).Pristine-looking in present-day New York, the reboot seems rather expensive, and its visual grandeur rightfully gives enough credits to the Special Effects advancement between the whopping thirty-some gap, with highlights like a green reptile ghost which is a mixture of dragon and Baphomet, running amok in a heavy metal concert, and the ultimate boss, a gigantic glowering form of Ghostbusters' trademark logo based on an unthinkable concept that a human being can be changed into an amorphous ghost simply by electrocution, that is what Rowan North (Casey), a withdrawn sociopath, manages to pull off after successfully building a portal to a ghost world.The dutiful cameos (Murray, Aykroyd, Hudson, Weaver, Potts and even the son of the late Harold Ramis) from the original franchise are less than surprising, the real deal here is McKinnon's Dr. Holtzmann, a unique incarnation of both flamboyance and geekiness, she is in effect the life force behind their enterprise, which makes Wiig and McCarthy look rather amateurish in this peculiar line of business, although it does seem to be pretty easy for her to constantly ply the team with updated ghost-capturing weaponry.Labelled as a faithful remake, this fantasy-comedy crowdpleaser doesn't deserve all the backlash, especially those sexist and racist ones, the problem seems to be - Paul Feig and his female- enpowering team ruefully pick a safe route to retread the old path, instead of going off the beaten track, at least for the sake of its comedic fodder, like he did in SPY (2015) last year with McCarthy, especially we are all fully aware what a superlative one-liner and deadpan impersonator Wiig is, alas, the entire project eventually settles for an unambitious aim which has been aptly executed, but, if they hope to reboot a new franchise, the first step is a middling one, and according to the financial turnover, a sequel is a long shot at this point.",Ghostbusters

35,Hellmant,Undoubtedly superior to 'GHOSTBUSTERS II'!,9,20 July 2016,"'GHOSTBUSTERS': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)A reboot to the classic 1984 sci-fi comedy hit, and it's 1989 sequel. This modern update has four women starting a New York City ghost-catching business together. It stars Melissa McCarthy, Kristen Wiig, Kate McKinnon and Leslie Jones (as the four leads); and it features Chris Hemsworth, Andy Garcia, Charles Dance, and most of the original movie's cast, in supporting roles. It was directed by Paul Feig (who previously directed McCarthy and Wiig in the hit comedy flick 'BRIDESMAIDS'), and it was written by Feig and Katie Dippold (who also wrote 'THE HEAT'; which was directed by Feig and costarring McCarthy). Ivan Reitman (the original two films' director) returned as a producer of this installment. The movie has received mostly positive reviews from critics, and female fans alike, but it's also taken a lot of sexist backlash from misogynistic moviegoers. It's been a hit at the Box Office as well (so far). I really liked it. Dr. Erin Gilbert (Wiig) and Dr. Abby Yates (McCarthy) co-wrote a book on the existence of ghosts, many years earlier. Gilbert has since attempted to distance herself from the publication; in order to become a teacher at Columbia University. Yates has continued to study paranormal activity, at a technical college, with her new colleague Jillian Holtzmann (McKinnon). When Gilbert is approached about a possible ghost sighting, she reunites with Yates (in order to investigate it). Gilbert, Yates and Holtzmann later start a 'ghost busting' business together; where they're soon joined by a subway worker named Patty Tolan (Jones). The movie is without a doubt funny, and also aptly made. Feig is definitely a talented director, and he and Dippold wrote a great script together. The cast is all exceptional as well. While the film is definitely not as memorable as the classic original, it is undoubtedly superior to 'GHOSTBUSTERS II'. I think it has the perfect combination of supernatural thrills, intelligent humor, and nostalgic magic. As far as your average reboots go, it's nearly flawless. The movie is also a very noticeable crowd-pleaser (at least at the theater I saw it at). It's definitely a lot of fun!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://vimeo.com/176638264",Ghostbusters
36,thesar-2,What a Bust,2,16 July 2016,"Forget everything you know about the original movie. Like the heart, the humor, the adventure and the charismatic characters.Let's get this straight: this movie is NOT funny. The best it got out of me was something Kristen Wiig said during one of the 319 homage scenes/cameos from the originals and I said ""Huh"" to indicate that was somewhat clever. Even my friend beside me said later he heard me say that but no actual laughter during the movie.Now, is it a terrible movie? Close, but it was refreshing they didn't do a shot-by-shot remake, so it did stand on its own. Plus, the 3-D was actually pretty darn good and I usually hate 3-D when forced to see it due to starting times. Getting the ""plot"" out of the way, it did somewhat follow the original's premise: three barely-making-it scientists band together to study, capture ghosts and make a living off of it. A fourth black character is thrown in to mimic the original's last piece of the group becausemovie. Aside from the ""humor"" they did insert, and I use that term very lightly because most of the jokes were the same statements the actresses say in every one of their movies, the biggest problem I had were the characters.No one in this movie was very likable or was anyone we could get behind. They were all so bland and when they did speak, they were just reading the script. The five leads were completely forgettable or despicable. Kristen Wiig played a very toned down and humorless version of all her other acting choices. Melissa McCarthy was just Melissa McCarthy – no change. Leslie Jones was a dreadful, walking stereotype borderlining on racismagainst blacks. And those three had nothing on the final two atrocities. Chris Hemsworth played Kevin, someone so incredibly dumb, he made Fifty Shades of Grey's Anastasia Steele look brilliant. It didn't even matter he portrayed someone so inept, he was just so annoying because in a movie full of ghosts, he was the least realistic part of the film. And then there's Kate McKinnon. Well, she was amazingly awful. Awful to look at, listen to and she truly made me cringe every single time she was on screen. She wasn't funny, her goofiness was unnecessary and all of her ""antics"" were predictable. And speaking of predictability, the jokes and set-ups (even the concert scene) were so incredibly old, this felt like it was written in the 1990s when they began wanting to make a third Ghostbusters film. Nothing felt fresh and because of this, 90% of what they called jokes were foreseen two shots ahead and I kept lifting my hands up to indicate: well, I was waiting on that.Since they rammed cameos and force feed us nostalgia, I guess someone could want to go see this. But, better just to see it free on Netflix. It's really hard to justify the cost of the movie theatre price in order to dumb down all senses to laugh at what would probably only make a toddler crack up.***Final thoughts: The trailers looked awful, unfunny and the CGI appeared bad. And at first, I was dreading seeing this. BUT, I love to surprise myself and always hope I'm wrong once the movie proves my initial thoughts invalid. Unfortunately, the trailers hit this straight on: It's just as bad as you thought it might be.And speaking of trailers, the 6-7 movie previews we saw before this film only featured ONE ""comedy"" (Bridget Jones's Baby and that literal one- joke trailer hardly counted as a comedy.) I thought this was weird since we're about to see a comedy. Heck, only one other one was remotely sci- fi. Maybe that should have been a good premonition to get up and leave before the film even started.",Ghostbusters
37,cherold,"Really funny movie, sadly harmed by a childish hate campaign",9,24 October 2016,"In Hollywood, every successful movie gets a reboot sooner or later. Some people hate reboots, but I generally like them. Often, as is the case with Batman or James Bond or Spider-Man, the reboot is actually better than the original.Since it's been a quarter of a century since I saw the original Ghostbusters, I can't say whether this one is better, worse, or about the same in quality, but I'm inclined towards about the same. Once again you have talented comics being very funny amidst flashy special effects. The story is different but follows a similar trajectory, with a group of ghost hunters encountering a ghostpocalypse and telling a lot of jokes. The new movie is a mix of references to and copying from the original along with new stuff.The funniest thing in the movie is Kate MacKinnon as the oddest of the ghostbusters, followed by Leslie Jones as a brash non-scientist. The movie's biggest stars, McCarthy and Wiig, are relatively subdued; it's strange to see McCarthy playing it so straight.There's not much of a plot and the final battle is a bit too close to the original's, but overall it's a really funny movie with excellent special effects and some exciting action.Unfortunately, there is unlikely to be a sequel because of the concerted efforts of certain people to destroy this movie. So I'd like to discuss some of the criticisms others have made.First off, I want to say that I don't think everyone who hates this movie is being unreasonable. We all have different tastes. Some people just don't like the jokes in this movie, or aren't drawn into the story, or don't care for the actors, and that's fine. My objection is to people who hated this movie before they even saw it (some of whom claim they watched it with an ""open mind"" even though their reviews suggest otherwise).Some criticisms aren't unreasonable. The movie has been criticized for making its one black character a non-scientist, and I think a good argument could be made for swapping McCarthy and Jones roles, which I think would have worked really well. Still, I feel some of people only claim the movie is racist because they are against it for other reasons and are just throwing that in.I've seen some complaints about the special effects. I took a look on youtube at some clips of the original, and really, if you think the special effects in the 1984 movie were better then you're living in a haze of nostalgia. The effects were good overall, but they're of their time.The complaint that is most absurd, and the one most used by the film's most idiotic critics, is that it's sexist. Some people hate change, and every time a comic book hero gets a new color or gender there is a rage explosion. If the reboot had just added one woman, there would have been a huge outcry on the Internet, but all four was enough to create a nuclear blast. People were really, really mad that a beloved movie of a bunch of cool dudes was being remade with icky, icky girls.Some people have complained that the dopey male secretary is sexist, but he's really not. It is not automatically sexist to have someone of a particular sex be stupid. There is a long history of film portrayals of idiotic men - for example, the Three Stooges. There is also a long history of portrayals of stupid, beautiful women - Hemsworth's character is a take-off on those - and I guarantee that at least 99.99% of all the boys calling the character sexist have never in their entire lives been bothered by a portrayal of a half- witted woman. The sexism claims are a classic example of fauxpression, where people are complaining not because they're hurt by something but because they are taking a weird revenge on any group who has ever claimed that their gender or race has disadvantaged them. These people generally complain about ""social justice warriors,"" love Donald Trump, hold the inexplicable belief that women who claim to be sci-fi geeks are frauds, and spend hours trolling on the Internet. These odious people are the reason there will not be a Ghostbusters 2, and the reason reboots are unlikely to bravely shake things up the way Ghostbusters did. If you could remove every review here that uses the word ""sexist"" you would have a much more accurate score for this movie. Instead, you have a small group of jerks with a lot of time bringing down a film score because their feelings are hurt by lady ghostbusters. I'm tempted to give this movie a 10 just for balance, but I don't believe in tilting scores like that, so I'll give it a 9.My friends all love this movie; it's a shame so many people skipped it.",Ghostbusters
38,FeastMode,my notes,6,30 June 2019,"With ridiculously low expectations, this movie was pleasantly surprising. Fun for the most part with lots of good laughs.

39,Robert_duder,Reviewing this as a film and nothing more,6,3 August 2016,"I am a huge fan of the original Ghostbusters. I'm not a Ghost-head or anything but I have always been a fan and grew up with them. I think all the hate on this film just for being a remake/reboot and just for having a female cast is ridiculous. The utter hatred for a film just for being what it is...is really sad. I was prepared to see this and judge it on it's own merits. The film has good points and bad. It doesn't really have anything spectacular and it doesn't live up to the original for a few reasons. The original Ghostbusters perfectly fit the comedy stylings of Bill Murray and Dan Akroyd especially. That cast just hit perfectly. Paul Feig attempts to do that again but squeezing the proper comedy of the four leads into the film and it struggles sometimes. One thing I will say is that they really did try and in fact I think they tried too hard. The ending of the film moves at breakneck speed and has so much going on that you almost lose track of things. The original film felt like the comedians lost themselves in their roles. Stanz, Venkman, Spengler and Zedemore were characters you loved. In this film you had McCarthy, Whiig, McKinnon and Jones are those women just doing the comedy they do best and it is lacklustre. That's not to say it deserves all the silly hate and it does pay a ton of homage to the original including cameos from all of the original main cast minus Moranis and the late great Harold Ramis.I've heard a few differing opinions on Kate McKinnon so I'll start with her. Some say this is a breakout role for her and some say she is overused and ridiculous. I'll go somewhere up the middle. I never cared for her much on Saturday Night Live but this is a good move for her. Her character is wild and crazy and fun and I could actually watch more of her. She actually has the most depth as far as the actress losing herself in the role. Kristen Wiig really struggles as the lead in this film. She's almost too bland and I feel like her comedy doesn't work here. She sticks out and this just wasn't her best role by any means. Melissa McCarthy is what her fans will expect. She does a decent job but usually she is best when she's being outrageous and this is pretty safe for her. Her and Wiig have terrible chemistry and they're supposed to have the best. I thought for sure Leslie Jones would be the blight on this cast. I assumed they would overuse her and she'd be in your face and obnoxious and she was not! Actually she was pretty good and had some funny moments though I heard some reviewers say she was ""hilarious""...no one in this film was THAT funny. The four of them together were....eh...so so. This is where it falls flat because the original cast were absolutely amazing together. All three surviving Ghostbusters show up in cameos that are actually really good as well as Sigorney Weaver as well. Ed Begley Jr., Karan Soni, and Neil Casey round out the rest of the cast and they're good. Soni is actually quite funny in a very small role and could have easily been the ""Rick Moranis"" of the film if they had let him. Casey is some sort of villain to the movie but that angle never really works either. Chris Hemsworth might be the best part of this movie as the dumb as nails secretary Kevin. He gets some hilariously awful lines and has better character arc than half the cast and this was a nice change for him.The best thing that Paul Feig did with Ghostbusters is that it still feels like the Ghostbusters. It has the same style, it has the Ecto-1, Slimer, ghosts, proton packs, sound effects, fans should actually be happy that this absolutely feels like it's in the same universe. The problem is not that they remade it or changed the cast to females...who cares about that! The problem is the cast and the characters (except for Kate McKinnon) are literally average at best, feel empty and awkward and their chemistry together is practically nil. This just doesn't work for this type of picture. So it's fun and outrageous with some good scenes and familiar territory but doesn't touch the original and on it's own is average and forgettable quite honestly. All that hoopla and disgusting behaviour from a fan base for a film that was averagely made anyways and did nothing to blight the memory of the original. At least now we have a Ghostbusters slightly worse than Ghostbusters 2 6.5/10",Ghostbusters
40,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"A misfiring, beguiling reversal of the original film",4,31 July 2016,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Practical minded university understudy Erin (Kristen Wiig) is having trouble landing any real credibility, while unsurprisingly her more wild and whacky friends Abby (Melissa McCarthy) and Jillian (Kate McKinnon) are even further impaired. But after reportings of a series of paranormal activities around New York, they come together and form their rag tag little group called the Ghostbusters, who come in handy when a disgruntled hotel worker named Neil Casey (Rowan North) plots to unleash a swarm of ghosts around the city.To some degree or another, some films find themselves in for a mauling even before they've been seen, because their very existence is to challenge, or to tamper with, something held in such high regard by so many that they've already drawn the knives before the finished product is shown. It's even more so this way when the makers attempt to totally reverse the formula of the original product, and have everything a little topsy turvy, like having women in roles that were originally done by men, as director Paul Fiig has done with this re-imaging of 1984's phenomenally successful Ghostbusters.In these more politically correct, equality diverse times, the sentiment behind the film might be to highlight female empowerment, in a way that might not have been so when the first film was made. Of course, this in itself wouldn't be such a terrible thing, except just as all the original male roles have been replaced, so has one of the main female roles from the first film, and Chris Hemsworth's role is as ridiculously stupid as they come, which does kind of give it the feel of being like this in a more aggressive kind of way.Fiig has made two other comedies with McCarthy before, Spy and The Heat, and here he has her far more restrained and less trashy mouthed, but not really any more hilarious, while McKinnon has a role that has no real personality of its own stamped on it. The one who emerges with the most presence and star quality is Wiig, but that certainly can't be said for Tolan, who's portrayed as a typically loud, obnoxious black character, that totally sets back everything Ernie Hudson delivered in his original minority role.The plot feels as though the makers tried to mould the plots of the original two films together, without really developing much of a solid, structural story for this film on its own. As such, the lack of any real laughs is even more affecting. To top it all off, it has to try and make up for the lack of quality with an endless succession of cameos, including all the original stars of the first film, bar the one who passed away. With the effects and humour of the original film still so amazing over thirty years on, this sanitized, watered down, PC modern version really can't stand on its own. **",Ghostbusters
41,ElMaruecan82,"No ""Ghostbusters"", no Blockbuster... more of a Ball-buster (in every meaning of the word)...",5,7 October 2016,"""Anything a woman does is empowering""Beyond what it pretends to deliver, this intelligently subversive quote from Lisa Simpson sums up the hypocritical aspect of today's feminism. Marge kept her gray hair but then decided to get back to the blue, both decisions were empowering. When you fail, just politicize the failure, ""Ghostbusters"" flopped, but at least, it empowered women. Politics shape society's thinking to the point a movie that was only supposed to be the reboot of a fun classic 80's franchise, became exploited by Hillary Clinton, and caused the media, the actresses and the director Paul Feig to fire back at the fans, calling them 'haters', and many of these insults were actually gender-oriented, how hypocritical is that?If the world was fair, women would have as much trouble as men to justify failures, but in reality, when you're a man, you've got no convenient excuse except if you belong to a minority, and even then, you better have good arguments. But in the name of crusading feminism, everything that doesn't work out exactly as you expect, is to blame on guys. Obviously, Paul Feig meant to make a groundbreaking and socially progressive masterpiece and we all failed to grab its genius, clouded we were by our hateful machismo. It doesn't matter that female critics disliked the film and that no blogger made an issue out of the gender. Anyway, I don't know if the backlash was sexist, but the response was worthy of the most oppressive totalitarian regimes. It is extraordinary that, in 2016, entertainers and journalists are indoctrinating people over the fact that ""Ghostbusters"" hatred on Youtube is due to its all female cast. In which galaxy were these people when the seventh ""Star Wars"" came out, or ""The Hunger Games"", ""Frozen"", ""Kill Bill"", ""Kick-Ass"", ""Alien"", ""Terminator""? Isn't the girl-power one of the most used, if not overused, trends in Hollywood? And I say 'overused' because the sight of female warriors doesn't necessarily arouse me. Indeed, many female protagonist kick ass, but that doesn't necessarily apply to be as 'strong' like men. See, there's always these 'manly' undertones behind the concept of strength and kicking-ass and it shows how actually feminism is so obsessed by the identification to the male model that it's predictable and easily exploitable. And taking for granted that women will see the film out of solidarity is another lamentable feminist fail. They used all the tricks, they visited hospitals, blabbed about woman's power but maybe the wisest thing to do was not to insult the fans. By attacking geeks or labeling them basement-45-year-old virgins, they simply sabotaged their own baby, and while these people advocate 'social justice', I think it's immanent justice that the film failed. It wasn't necessarily bad but using gender as a immunity against criticism is such a detestable bit of arrogance that its flop is only good Karma. Indeed, it takes more than cast members with vaginas to appeal to women.These four women were fun to watch and obviously had fun making the film, and their enthusiasm was catching more than once, I loved Melissa McCarthy, Kristen Weig and to some extent Kate McKinnon and Leslie Jones, but there are things the film got wrong and that have nothing to do with gender but hypocrisy, starting with the obvious: the male-bashing agenda. Have anyone notice that guys are either stupid or pricks, that there are no likable male protagonists whatsoever? Chris Hemsworth as the dumb blonde secretary was funny but the film lingered too much on that one-note performance. I don't know if they had a specific record to settle with guys but how about the first one who sees a ghost, he defecates in his pants, this is not just mentioned, they insist upon it. To the question ""Is it because we are women?"" , a fat guy give them the middle fingers. No guy would do that but the film is set in a world allowing such sexist fantasies.And as if the defenestration of Bill Murray wasn't enough, they pushed the ultimate outrage bu shooting the logo in the balls. Well, maybe it's an admission of the society's castrating effect but when you lecture people about sexism, make sure you're immune to that allegation. I don't recall a dumb secretary in the original, Annie Potts was a street-smart woman and Sigourney Weaver played a memorable sophisticated Manhattan artist. Even the villain was weak, but what would you expect from a guy?If in the name of feminism, men are become treated like the way feminists think men treated women, this is not social progress but mean-spirited vengeance. But how could I talk about progress? Feig didn't have the guts to make Kate McKinnon's character an outspoken lesbian but didn't bother making Leslie Jones the loudmouth soul sister, as if Ernie Hudson had to pull an Eddie Murphy. That's for the hypocrisy. As for the rest, I didn't care much for the ghosts or the whole proton-packing moments, the awaited special effect was on the laughs department. The original film was an accidental masterpiece, but the chemistry worked and it became a comedy staple. Paul Feig wanted so desperately to make a 'phenomenon' that he failed to capture the magic of the first film, hell, he even forgot to have a plot. I cringed when I realized that the film ignored the past events, that these New Yorkers wouldn't remember the Marshmallow Man or the Statue of Liberty walking across the street, I guess they wanted to make these girls the pioneers and just ignore the previous legacy. Well, in return, the fans will pretend this one never happened, and the only phenomenon rose was this pointless but so revealing gender uproar. I said about the first ""Ghostbusters"" that it reminds about how fun the 80's were, this one will remind us of how depressing our time is.",Ghostbusters
42,bowmanblue,Not as bad as I thought it would be (and probably not as bad as you feared),7,29 July 2016,"In case you haven't heard, the 2016 remake of Ghostbusters' trailer received the most 'thumbs down' dislikes on Youtube when it was first released. This produced cries of 'misogyny' from some quarters, as the previously all-male cast has now been replaced with all women. I suppose when you read this you should know that, I too, am a male. I too 'disliked' the trailer. And I too am old enough to be only six years old when I saw the original in cinemas all that time ago.I didn't dislike the trailer because of the women. A new Ghostbusters film has been in the works for so long that I've heard all sorts of ideas mentioned with what to do with continuing the franchise. The popular thought was that it would be a sequel where the old boys hand over the torch to a new ghost-busting generation. That was what I hoped. What I got was a remake.Yes, the trailer was awful. First of all it misled the viewers into thinking it WAS a sequel, only to reveal that it was a remake that looked almost shot-for-shot. I actually stopped watching the trailer simply because it bored me. There weren't enough jokes and the whole thing just looked pointless. I wasn't going to watch the film, but ended up taking my eleven year old daughter. From the moment the film started I was desperate to justify my 'thumbs down' – I hated the special effects, I hated the characters, I hated the fact that – yes – the story was basically a photocopied version of the 1985 script. Then I started smiling.I use the word 'smile' over 'laugh.' Laugh may be a little too generous. There aren't that many huge belly laughs to be had, but definitely smiling was participated in. It's actually not that bad. The script is a copy, but there are just about enough nice jokes to justify its existence. Yes, I'd have preferred a sequel, but this could have been a lot worse. There is plenty of chemistry between the new cast to enjoy it. I know that not only did people cry 'sexism' regarding the treatment of the female leads, but some then went on to add 'racism' to the mix when the three white women are all intellectual scientists when the old black lead is merely a subway worker. Personally, I enjoyed all their performances – even Chris 'Thor' Hemsworth was fun (sporting a weird British-Thor hybrid accent) and the surviving old cast members may even show their faces.If you loved the original Ghostbusters, you still will. It's original and perfectly-made. However, if you haven't seen it – as many of today's youth probably won't – then they will probably justify this film's existence. If you love the original then you also probably own it. Unless you're taken to see this version I suggest you stick with what you know. However, if you do find yourself being taken to see the 2016 version, don't go in to it filled with hate and resentment. Like I say, it's not that bad.",Ghostbusters
43,ThomasDrufke,Missed Potential,5,17 July 2016,"Ghostbusters will likely go down as one of the most controversial films for absolutely ridiculous reasons. But by no means is this a film that doesn't deserve critique. With laughs built around nostalgia though it swears to have no real connection to the original film, Ghostbusters is merely a passable comedy.Amidst all of the unnecessary hate for the marketing campaign and particularly the choice to have female protagonists, I've been one to sit back and watch. I've never understood the need to dislike a film before its release, no matter the subject matter. With that said, the problems have absolutely nothing to do with its talented 4 lead females. In fact, I quite enjoyed the chemistry between Kristen Wiig, Melissa McCarthy, Kate McKinnon, and Leslie Jones.Wiig has been one of my favorite comedic actresses for some time now and McCarthy is very good when her character is toned down to a realistic level and she isn't doing to the same shtick in every film. Combine them with decent SNL up and comers and you have a likable team of Ghostbusters. Where the film falters is the story built around them. I've had a good time watching Paul Feig's films in the past, but none of them have impressed me quite the way I had hoped.Feig seems to prefer silly over a witty approach to his characters. Though I liked the performances of all 4 Ghostbusters, McKinnon and Jones feel much more like caricatures than people who would actually live in New York City. Even Chris Hemsworth, who I enjoyed every second he was on screen, was way more over the top than I would have preferred.This approach did produce many funny moments with laugh out loud gags, it can't carry you through an entire 110 minute runtime. It's almost like an SNL skit could and would have been the better option here. But even as I'm saying this, I know that there is potential here for a great comedy. The foundation of this franchise is set for future installments, I just want to see a slightly more serious film with gags here and there mixed in.Overall, it's far from a bad film, but its near spoof aesthetic ruined a lot of the enjoyment that I could have had. A nicely structured set up became convoluted and unfortunately a bore when the film crippled its way to the third act.

46,Cineanalyst,To not-so-Boldly go where Man has gone Before,4,30 September 2018,"I have a bias against this new ""Ghostbusters"" that I'll admit, and it's not some stupid sexist one, or a general hatred of reboots/remakes/reworkings, but it's that I never cared too much for the silly comedy of the 1984 original, either, let alone its lackluster sequel. And nostalgia for the boys-club version is one of the main appeals this 2016 girl-power iteration makes. After a slow start involving Professor Gilbert's (Kristen Wiig) tenure and the resurfacing of a book she co-authored in the past with former pal Abby Yates (Melissa McCarthy), which I couldn't care less about, setting up the rekindling of their friendship (again, uninteresting), followed by the usual and lengthy science-y mumbo-jumbo, which I suppose seems to be required for the spectator to buy into the ""ghosts are real"" narrative (although it surely could've done without resorting to the maps being in alignment, couldn't it have?), the pacing thereafter actually isn't bad. Albeit, this latter part is full of references to the 1980s films, which tend to be inconsequential to the plot--cameos, logos and quotations of specific scenes, sets, ghost characters, theme music and lines--and CGI action sequences and an after-credits setup for a sequel that are more in the spirit of MCU-inspired franchise building than to the original ""Ghostbusters"" films.Appropriately, given that the women ghostbusters shoot, punch and sling their energy-stream laser things like lightning bolts from Thor's hammer, the movie casts the MCU's Thor, Chris Hemsworth, in the reverse-gendered role of the bimbo, as well as the damsel-in-distress. The 1980s films had at least a few of these types, too, except they tended to be women. The 1984 film also had a strange anti-EPA plotline, and the sequel lampooned government, as well; here, this is watered down to a generic government cover-up conspiracy. Additionally, I can live without the ghost fellatio and the crossing of streams that wouldn't have had the same resonance with a female cast, although I do think the paraphilia and homoeroticism are what make the 1984 film interesting (I grant that this is not a mainstream interpretation). Otherwise, the best part of the original films was Bill Murray's wisecracking. He was kind of like the guys from Mystery Science Theater 3000, riffing on how ludicrous everything in the film is, except he was a character in it. This 2016 alternate world lacks that, and much of the humor is more slapstick based. Plus, Wiig and McCarthy aren't half as delightful as they were in ""Bridesmaids"" (2011). Kate McKinnon is the standout; she has a distinctive voice, and her mechanic is entirely wacky. Too bad the rest of the movie is an uneven and uninspired retread.",Ghostbusters

I admit that I consider the original film to be great, but it's not among my favorite. I really don't think it's on the same level as ""Airplane!"" or ""Monty Python And The Holy Grail"".

People were expecting a shot for shot remake of the original, but it is safe to say it stands out on it's own, it does not rely on the 1984 film or copy it in any way, it really is its own movie. The new characters are not imitations of Penter Venkman or Egon Spengler, they are completely original. Holtzmann is a particularly great new character, wacky and flamboyant, the perfect role for the hilarious Kate McKinnon. I was glad that there was no cast member that was ""the female Dan Aykroyd"" or ""the new Bill Murray"". It is certainly missing elements that made the first two movies unforgettable, there is no love story, Bill Murray and Sigourney Weaver's relationship was one of the strongest features of the original, no characters have any sort of love life here, which added a personal factor and makes them more relatable. As well as that, no one takes the lead role, Murray being in the lead allows him to hold the rest of the film together, however, all four characters are given equal screen time which gives us no one to route for. They also did not create any new, memorable ghosts, which disappointed no, there's no new Slimer or Marshmallow Man, no humorous ghost characters, only overly scary ones, and a brief, forgetful appearance from the two I previously mentioned. The cast is stellar, the four female leads shine, their chemistry with one another is terrific and I would be happy to see them together again. There are also great cameos throughout, including the original cast members and Chris Hemsworth also shines as the male receptionist, showing a surprisingly terrific flare for comedy. Fun, action packed and a hilarious cast, Paul Feig may not truly capture the magic of the original series, but he created a loving tribute that stands out on its own, Ghostbusters is worth the watch for anyone looking for a good comedy or adventure.

I thought the CGI was terrible, not frightening as the villains in the original Ghostbusters films were. They really made Kirsten Wigg, Leslie Jones, Kate McKinnon and Melissa McCarthy look bad as comedy actresses. As much as it was a good idea to have female Ghostbusters, it still didn't work out! God I just think they made such a balls out of this. Dan Akyrod should've done a third sequel or just forget about people trying to make the franchise alive. It just turned out rubbish at the end of the day!I found the story line dragging on that ìt bore me to ultimate tears! The jokes weren't even funny, like I tried to laugh at them but just couldn't! The characters needed to be more themselves instead of being stereotypical. This has got to be one of the awful and horrible reboot movies I have ever seen in my life! Worst film of 2016!",Ghostbusters
51,cosmo_tiger,The fault in this isn't the actors. The problem was pacing & the fact that this movie was way to focused on special effects,5,11 October 2016,"""She can't just move. She can't call the police, she can't call her friends. Who's she gonna call?"" Erin Gilbert (Wiig) is a respected teacher at Columbia and is about to get an offer of tenure. Things get stalled when an old book she wrote with Abby Yates (McCarthy) dealing with paranormal activity is unearthed. When Erin goes to discuss it with Abby they actually see a real ghost, and everything changes. This is a movie I was really torn about. The original is a classic and one of my favorite movies of all time. All of the women in this movie are hilarious, but based off of the previews I was a little worried. All that said, I finally sat down to watch this...and it was pretty much what I expected. All of the girls were really funny in this, but it felt like they only got to the comedy in between the overused special effects. The original was so good because the effects were sparse, which gave them more impact, and the focus was on the actors and comedy. This movie felt longer than the 2 hour run time and was basically fighting ghosts in between scenes of them talking about their new weapons. I had low expectations going in and pretty much got what I expected. The fault in this is not the actors, or even the writing. The real problem is the pacing and the fact that this movie was way to focused on special effects. That's not what was magical about the original. Overall, actors are very funny in this but it was missing all of the magic of the original. I give this a C+.",Ghostbusters
52,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews...,5,12 October 2016,"GhostbustersFemale Ghostbusters are better because you get to pay them 40% less than their male counterparts.Unfortunately, the gender wage gap doesn't benefit the entrepreneurs in this comedy.When a book Dr. Gilbert (Kristen Wiig) co-wrote on ghosts with her estranged colleague Dr. Yates (Melissa McCarthy) is reprinted, its supernatural contents threaten her bid for college tenure.To stop the publication, however, she must join Yates' ghost hunting team (Kate McKinnon, Leslie Jones), who are currently engaged in a conflict with a deranged genius (Neil Casey) intent on opening a portal to another dimension.While the all-female cast brings a fresh perspective to the mythos, this re-working of the original is too haunted by its predecessor to be its own movie. Not to mention its ghastly script, flat jokes and lacklustre special effects. Moreover, ghosts from the 1800s will be aghast to see these Ghostbusters in public unaccompanied by their husbands.

53,ironhorse_iv,"Who you going to call? Well, it's not 2016's 'Ghostbusters'. It was a bust to me. I didn't like it.",5,5 August 2016,"Even before this movie trailer even came out, its production spark a lot of negativity hostility over the choices that director Paul Feig has done to reboot the 'Ghostbuster' series. One of those decisions, was the idea of replace the old and aging original actors from the 1984's film, 'Ghostbusters', with new female cast, playing new characters capturing ghosts like Melissa McCarthy as Dr. Abby Yates, Kristen Wiig as Dr. Erin Gilbert, Kate McKinnon as Dr. Jillian Holtzmann & Leslie Jones as Patty Tolan. Personally, for me, I would little to no problem with this, if only, Feig choose to do something new with that, instead, of hiring the same tiresome two actresses, he work with, the last several 5 years. Me, personally, I'm not a big fan of Wiig or McCarthy's past works, but I'm still willing to see, their movies if they deliver, something funny. Sadly, they were not. They were by far, the weakest of the main characters. Surprising, both McKinnon, and Jones's characters were a lot funnier. They weren't as offensive as the trailer make them out to be. However, I can't say, the same for Chris Hemsworth as Kevin Beckman and the other men characters in the film, whom comes across, as too dumb, horrible or mean-spirited. The movie is more misandry than misogamy, it seems. I also didn't like the cameos of the original actors in different roles. It was too jarring and sad. Sadly, this movie didn't hit my funny bone, much, too. It was mostly a miss for me. I was more disappointed, than angry. Yet, I did think, other critics and fans, went a little overboard. Even before the film even came out, people went totally insane. If you thought it looked good, you were betraying the original. If you thought it looked bad, you were a sexist and racist pig. There was no in-between. If you wanted to go see it, you were wrong. If you didn't want to go see it, you were wrong in not seeing it. Talking about 'Ghostbusters' has really became unpleasant to talk about. I kinda miss, the old days, where the only debate was if 1989's 'Ghostbusters II' was meh or not. Now, it's a bloodbath cover in political/social yellow tape. It's hard to talk about this movie, without addressing all of ""controversy"" surrounding it. So let's start with the reasons, why there is a reboot in the first place. The reason why there isn't a third 'Ghostbusters' is because one big reason: Bill Murray. His refusal to commit to any studio blockbuster project as the main lead, really hurt the production. Personally, he wish to act less and not deal with the studios; so he continue to have a career in smaller quirky melancholy Indy films taking supporting roles; only showing up in bigger films if he was voice-acting or playing a minor character. For the most part, it was somewhat alright decision from him. However, it killed any attempt on a 'Ghostbusters III' sequel. Add to the fact that Murray suffers from mood swings that often butt-heads, with original co-stars, Harold Ramis and Dan Aykroyd, then you know why this idea fail. Honestly, in my opinion, Columbia & Sony should had made the movie without him, years ago, as it pretty clear, that his trolling with them. If you got anybody to blame for this movie existing; blame Murray's stubbornness and Columbia's cowardly to greenlit the production without him. Yes, it's a big pill to swallow, but you will swallow it. Harold Ramis's death in 2014 was the death nail, yet somewhat its revival. It's finally gave Columbia & Sony's some balls to go against Bill Murray for dragging his feet on a planned ""Ghostbusters"" reboot. Now, this brings us to Sony Hack Scandal of 2014 in which North Korean hackers released private information about oncoming movies on the internet in revenge for mocking their leader in the 2014's film 'The Interview'. It's here, that expose the misguided influence of the studio. They knew that Feig had some strange and essentially blasphemous ideas he had for a sequel/reboot, which they knew would stir up enough controversy and hype towards the project. In a leaked email, it was revealed that he had pitched some concepts that could appeal to the highly popular, 'Social Justice' Movement. Later emails has also show, Sony ""rigging"" of YouTube comments for the initial trailer, removing any negative comments that don't expressly address the misogynistic, anti-women angle, as well as discussing what the original 'Ghostbusters' cast thought about the project from behind the scenes, contrary to what the media would have you believe. While none of this is a valid excuse for the marketing failure, it at least answers some questions as to why they felt the need to create such an insulting representation of such a beloved franchise. The more and more backlash I see against this film, and all the controversy surrounding it, I just have to ask: why are we getting so hostile over something like 2016's 'Ghostbusters'!?! It's a stupid premise movie. Nothing was really that special, besides 'women attraction', the plot and character traits is pretty much recycle, just now full of unneeded exposition; because of that, this movie suffers from bad pacing. The villain is also forgettable and generic; plus his unlimited powers is not explain well. The action scenes with the ghostbusters look fake and unrealistic. It's seem like Feig was a fan of 1986's 'The Real Ghostbusters' TV cartoon series, because the CGI ghosts look too cartoony, like if they were leftovers from 2003's 'Haunted Mansion' and 2004's 'Scooby Doo 2 Monsters Unleashed'. Last, but not least, the modern remixed of the classic 'Ghostbuster' theme by the band, Fall Out Boy, was horrible. Overall: I wanted to really give this movie, a chance with me, but unfortunately it is just below average. I can't recommended watching.",Ghostbusters
54,The-Sarkologist,Ruins a Classic Movie,1,16 July 2016,"Okay, I am probably being a little too harsh on this film, but there are just some movies that should never be remade, even if the creators decided that a few extra things might make the film somewhat more interesting. In my opinion Ghostbusters is definitely one of those films – there is no way that a film in 2016 is simply going to be able to recreate the electricity that the original film produced, and even though I swore that I wouldn't see this film I ended up doing so simply to prove to myself that I was indeed correct (not that I actually needed to do this).While the original wasn't perfect, it was still a great film, and simply didn't need to have any changes made to it. For instance, making the Ghostbusters all women simply reeked of what one could consider excessive feminism – it simply didn't need to be done. This was one of those films which pretty much made all of the men either bad, or incredibly stupid (as was the case with Kevin). In fact the inclusion of Kevin simply felt as if it was payback for all the times that movies have used the stereotypical dumb blonde. Sure, that stereotype is pretty appalling, but by making the dumb blonde a guy simply is bordering on somebody going out of their way to be offensive – something that the original film never tried to do.The plot is pretty similar to the original movie – a couple of scientists are trying to prove paranormal activity and are laughed at by the academic community. Actually, we have one character who is a professor at Columbia University and is trying to get tenure, except that a book she wrote in the past, which she believed that she had destroyed, has come back to haunt her. Upon discovering this (and a couple of other damning things), the Dean kicks her out and she is forced to team up with an old friend, and a rather eccentric engineer. This is when the ghosts start appearing, and as a way to make money, they decide to fight them. Mind you, unlike the first movie, we don't have them running around collecting ghosts and sealing them away – they only fight two of them before the grand finale.As I suggested, the engineer and her gadgets were pretty cool, and there were some funny moments in the movie. While I did enjoy it, and it did do some good things, I still couldn't help but pine for the original film, and mourn at the fact that in the end the original film was so much better and should have been left alone.",Ghostbusters
55,jacobjohntaylor1,It only seems like a bad movie if you do not know a good fantasy movie when they see it.,9,20 July 2016,This a great movie. It is not better then the original Ghost busters. Ghost busters II is also better. But still this is a very good movie. It has a great story line. It also has great acting. It also has great special effects. It is a great movie. The people who made did a great job. All the Ghost busters movies are great movie. This is not a 5.3 that is just underrating it. This not a great remake. But it is a good remake. This is one the best fantasy movie from the decade. It is very scary. It is scarier then The Shinning. See this movie it is a great movie. I give 9 out of 10.

56,Reno-Rangan,The ghosts are real and the scientists are hunting them down!,6,14 October 2016,"First of all I am not a fan of the original film, but I enjoyed watching them. So I anticipated this film for the updates to deliver what I'm looking for, including some good jokes, but I found it an average film. I am very interested to have the women's version of hit the films and vice versa, but there are not many films in this category. All I wanted was 'The Expendables', but they made this one. I think it was a great idea, though the execution was really impressive.The story was okay type, they kept it very simple. No big developments, except two main characters. But all the four women were good, along with Chris Hemsworth as a worthy sidekick. The director whose favourite casting actress, Melissa McCarthy's fourth film with him in four years and he did his job well, but the screenplay lets the film down.There's no major comparison with the original, because this is a reboot and obviously has similar appeal from visual to comedies. Except they talk too much science thing because of todays advanced science. The disappointments are the ghosts, the film did not give preference for them to show their atrocities. I mean the perspective was always from the women gang who fights them. Definitely a one time watchable film, for its decent graphics, performances and some good comedies.6/10",Ghostbusters

58,tomgillespie2002,Simply isn't funny,4,6 October 2016,"There was talk of a Dan Akroyd/Harold Ramis-scripted Ghostbusters sequel for years, with Colombia Pictures understandably keen to reignite the love showered on what is their most commercially successful franchise. While Akroyd and Ramis had an idea in mind, Bill Murray, going through a career renaissance after his lauded performance in Lost in Translation (2004) and working frequently with Wes Anderson and Jim Jarmusch, was not interested. Then in 2014, Ramis passed away, and all hopes of seeing the original foursome together again died with him. However, it didn't take long for Sony to announce that Paul Feig would be taking the franchise in another direction, and changing the gender of the main cast in the process.For some, including myself, this announcement was an interesting idea. After all, Feig had handled a female comedy ensemble before with Bridemaids (2011), which was well-received by both critics and audiences, and had a muse in the form of Melissa McCarthy, who he had worked with on The Heat (2013) and Spy (2015). McCarthy and fellow Bridemaids star Kristen Wiig were cast as the leads, and would be supported by Saturday Night Live alums Kate McKinnon and Leslie Jones, completing the titular group of ghost trappers. Yet Feig's vision also inspired one of the ugliest online backlashes in memory, and while fan opposition can always be expected when dealing with a remake of a beloved piece of nostalgia, there was also racism and misogyny, resulting in the film's trailer being voted the most hated in YouTube's history.Such repugnant trolling only made me want to love the film more, despite my own dislike of what I saw in the trailer and desire to see a childhood favourite well and truly left alone. After a promising and unexpectedly creepy opening, in which a tour guide is chased and attacked by a malevolent glowing goo, and an enjoyable introduction to three of the main characters, Ghostbusters 2016 fails to hit the mark on almost every level. The biggest crime is how tight a leash Feig keeps on Wiig and McCarthy, both wasted here as the 'straight' guys, forced to speak scientific gobbledegook in an attempt to explain the plot, while McKinnon and Jones get to do the goofy stuff to grating effect. Wiig is Erin Gilbert, a professor hoping to get tenure at Colombia University who tracks down her old pal Abby Yates (McCarthy) after she finds a book they co-authored years earlier about the existence of ghosts selling on Amazon. With ghosts starting to crop up all over the city, it isn't long before Erin is down with Abby's crazy- sounding ideas and, along with the latter's unhinged engineer Jillian (McKinnon), form the Ghostbusters. They hire the handsome but completely stupid secretary Kevin (Chris Hemsworth), and are eventually joined by subway worker Patty (Jones), who offers her 'street smarts' and knowledge of the city to make up for her lack of scientific know-how. The sudden appearance of ghosts is down to the work of disgruntled mad scientist Rowan North (Neil Casey), a bellhop who plans to bring the apocalypse.The film makes a huge effort to pay its respects to the 1984 and 1989 originals, with homages made to the likes of Marshmallow Man and Rick Moranis' character, and featuring cameos from Murray, Akroyd, Ernie Hudson, Sigourney Weaver and Annie Potts. Yet while such nods are normally welcome, here they do little but gloss over the absence of any real laughs and emotional connection to the characters. There's also an over-reliance of set-pieces and special effects, with a thinly-drawn antagonist with the haziest of motivations. The funniest part of the movie is Hemsworth, who really does have a talent for comedy, but even he is embarrassed later on with a silly dance scene. To the online mob who may try to say ""I told you so,"" - Ghostbusters isn't bad because of the gender switch or its audacity in trying to reboot a classic, it's bad because it simply isn't funny.",Ghostbusters
59,Thanos_Alfie,Not good...,5,5 December 2018,"""Ghostbusters"" is a Comedy - Fantasy movie in which we watch a group of four women trying to stop a ghost invasion in Manhattan. The group was made up from two paranormal enthusiasts, a nuclear engineer, and a subway worker who will have to try their best in order to first capture all the ghosts that are free in Manhattan and second to secure them to a safe location.I have to admit that I had high expectations from this movie but I was a bit disappointed by it after watching it. Since I had already watched the previous two movies of ""Ghostbusters"" I unconsciously compared them to this new movie and as you can understand the outcome wasn't good. Despite the silly jokes which I didn't find funny at all and the idiotic interpretation that Chris Hemsworth had to make I believe that the direction which was made by Paul Feig wasn't that bad and if he just changed some small thing it would be better. The only interpretation that I really enjoyed in this movie was Kate McKinnon's who played as Jillian Holtzmann and she really good at it.In conclusion, I have to say that ""Ghostbusters"" isn't the best movie to watch except if you are watching it with your children, then I am sure that they are going to love it. To be honest I don't recommend this movie to anyone and let me say that if you have already watched the previous ""Ghostbusters"" movies then just rewatch them, it will be far better than watching this movie.",Ghostbusters
60,eddie_baggins,Won't be busting any sides with laughter,4,21 February 2017,"There has been so much said in both the lead up and aftermath of the release of Ghostbusters, Paul Feig's female orientated re-doing of the beloved 1980's comedy property, that it feels as though there's almost nothing else to be said about it.Regardless of all that has been said, both from the haters (who get mentions here), those on the fence and those that have found this reimagining to be the entertaining comedy rush they wanted, this 2016 version of a bunch of ghost hunting misfits patrolling New York city as a collection of nasty ghouls run amok is neither humorous enough, engaging enough or even imaginative enough to even be held up to the high flying original released in 1984 nor the rather so-so sequel from 1989.Falling into the recent traps of modern day big budgeted events, the biggest problem Ghostbusters encounters is creating a decent story (which isn't even worth talking about) and with the film neither being a direct sequel or a remake, Feig and his co-writer Katie Dippold have created a rather uninspiring plot line that throws our talented female cast into a world of green slime and celebrity cameos but forgets to engage us along for the ride.A majority of the films laughs come from either jokes made at the expense or remembrance of the old films or from Chris Hemsworth's dim-witted office clerk Kevin, while the cast who've all plied their trades in various comedy enterprises over the year struggle in what was likely a case of the studio holding back their rather bizarre antics in hope of keeping the film as PG as possible for the widest audience available.It's a shame the cast weren't given total free reign to take this material somewhere new and exciting as it's not enough to just change the demographic from male to female orientation and while it's refreshing to see Melissa McCarthy be dialled back a notch or two after a string of ADHD like performances, she fails to make a mark while Wiig and SNL's Kate McKinnon get short shrift leaving the films last big four member Leslie Jones to take up slack with her loud mouthed Patty Tolan taking home the teams major wins.At the end of the day it feels as though this repainted Ghostbusters was neither a film many wanted or called out for and failed to show any of the haters wrong with a film that is neither a win in the comedy stakes, the originality stakes or the entertainment stakes.Whilst perhaps not as bad as many feared, Ghostbusters biggest crime is a waste of a ready-made brand name in its creation of a film that is instantly forgettable. Something that was never the case when we first called the Ghostbusters all those years ago.2 cans of Pringles out of 5",Ghostbusters
61,johnnyboyz,It came; it saw; it....didn't kick much ass.,5,25 December 2019,"The first name in the end credits of ""Ghostbusters"" is a certain Zach Woods, who is listed as playing a tour guide. Because people are listed by order of appearance, it felt like entire days had passed since that character was on screen. Suffice to say, the 2016 re-envisaging of an 80's family favourite which spawned one sequel and its own cartoon series, ""Ghostbusters"", is a complete slog - too long and ultimately not much more than a fancy demonstration of what the latest in special effects are capable of. Most of its moments, particularly in the final act, exist for TV-spots and trailers - a little stunt followed by a one-liner. Its product placement is shameless and most prevalent in the first hour, during which I suppose it is assumed the audience is still paying the most attention; its popular culture references often painful - please don't remind us of 'the mayor in Jaws', because you're just reminding us of a better film. Maybe you're on-side for a while, but boy does that bell-curve drop off fast.The film covers four women, though lacks any real protagonist, aged between about thirty and forty-five in modern New York City. Erin (Kristen Wiig) is a lecturer at Columbia university who, on the cusp of a promotion, is horrified to discover an old friend named Abby (Melissa McCarthy) promoting something pseudo-scientific via the Internet to do with ghost-hunting that they both toyed with in their university days - something Erin fears her bosses might discover and be put off by. We get a sense of the different routes these women have gone down when Erin pays Abby a visit, whose wacky metallic helmet she has on when we first see her I think is designed to call to mind Emmett Brown's and is meant to infer a sense of the mad scientist who aims high, but often falls flat. Erin, by comparison, wears tweed and speaks more eloquently.Rather than set things straight, Wiig's character is pulled along to an investigation Abby conducts with a younger assistant named Jillian (Kate McKinnon), whose later role in the film is to essentially invent a new contraption whenever the script needs it, at an old haunted house which we watched rattle that tour guide during the opening. It is here the film tries to replicate the memorable scene in the 1984 original, when the eponymous heroes go down into a haunted library and encounter something which takes us all by surprise, but it doesn't quite come off here - it doesn't find that place in-between scary and funny that Reitman found. Regardless, Erin changes her mind; loses both her promotion and job at the behest of a stuffy Charles Dance and moves in with Abby and Jillian to prove the world wrong via the pseudo-science of ghost hunting which, turns out, isn't so pseudo...What the film branches out into from here is a curious mix of genre-tropes; patchy storytelling; some decent gags and a lot of family friendly action scares which, collectively, often fail to justify as to why the remake exists. The women, true to tradition, find a disused space the size of a warehouse to open their titular operation while a fourth member, Leslie Jones' Patty, who conspicuously leaves her stable job as a subway ticket inspector to join this farce, obtains an old hearse that they use as an official vehicle. They hire a receptionist to take calls, a bespectacled simpleton played by Chris Hemsworth named Kevin, who is funny at first, but whose idiocy eventually becomes so unbelievable that you'd think it was the prototype to a new Sacha Baron Cohen character. Erin likes him for his looks; in contrast to three of the women, who are skilled scientists and inventors, Kevin is a buffoon, which if the roles were reversed, and the blonde imbecile was female, would be rightly derided as sexist. And where is all the money coming from to pay for any of this?The film's gender politics, which has so consumed the project and the response to it in the aftermath of its release that rational textual analysis has been tossed aside, seems to gravitate along the frequency of pushing more girls into science, a popular ideological trope amongst contemporary feminism. But this is all surface. McKinnon, who joyfully brings to life the character of Jillian with a series of piercing stares; cheeky smirks and robotic movements, just does not ultimately strike us as a convincing inventor when viewed critically.What's more, it too often feels as if the ideology itself has picked the wrong subject matter for the politick to hand: if we usurped the four women and replaced them with male counterparts at script stage, but kept every scene; action and line of dialogue the same, nothing would change within the contextualised framework. The best feminist texts at the moment in a filmic sense, if that is what you're into, are probably coming out of the Middle East, where actual female-centric narratives and stories about women's issues are being produced, and often by actual women.A character by the name of Rowan fills in for the film's idea of antagonist; well, for most of the time. He's a young, funny looking kid with a strange expression and curly hair who works at a hotel and plots something nasty with evil spirits whom he cannot yet release. A fascist, and so an easy villain to pen, he believes that society cannot be cleansed enough of its undesirables due to past grievances. Neil Casey does what he can with the role, certainly channelling Peter MacNicol from the second film in appearance, but it is a thankless task. Wracking my brain, it is difficult to entirely envisage what a Ghostbusters remake 25 years after the fact was supposed to look like and why it might be at all needed. Was it really necessary? I'm unconvinced it was.",Ghostbusters
62,filipemanuelneto,"It's entertaining, sometimes makes you laugh, but it has videogame visuals and a sense of guilt and gender expiation. The quest for political correctness suffocates the film.",2,23 October 2021,"Released almost twenty years late, this is the third film in the ""Ghostbusters"" franchise. In fact, I only understood the reason for the delay after some reading: a contract specified that a new film would be released if the director and the four original protagonists agreed, and that agreement has never been possible until now. On the one hand, I'm glad that this has been surpassed, but on the other hand I confess that I expected something more: this film is good, it entertains and is a visual spectacle, but it has many flaws. For me, the most outrageous is to ignore original films. That is, I would have preferred to see a sequel which continues the story and takes into account the years that have passed, than a pure and simple ""reboot"" that ignores everything before.The script begins with the meeting of two old friends, both scientists, who in the past were fascinated by the world of the supernatural. One of them remains connected to this and is head of a university research office, but the other wants to forget about it, and be regarded as a serious academic in the scientific world. However, the way they quickly bridge their differences and re-match efforts is far-fetched, and the film's continuation will not improve that: we have forced, unbelievable, illogical ideas and situations, ill-conceived characters, a constant and irritating obsession with gender issues and political correctness, which keep the quality of the plot below what we can demand. Because of this, and other issues that I will address, I am forced to rate director Paul Feig's performance as an amateur. He seems to have simply let things go by themselves, intervening as little as possible and demanding only the basics of everything and everyone.The cast has several strong names, starting with the quartet formed by Melissa McCarthy, Kristen Wiig, Kate McKinnon and Leslie Jones. I really can't say something bad about their work. I think they did the best they could with the material they received, even though the dialogue is fake, the jokes are silly, and the characters are as dense as a cardboard. Jones is the better to handle it, in contrast to a sleepy McCarthy and an exaggerated, histrionic McKinnon. Contrary to what some might have thought, I don't believe the fact that they are women (in the previous films, the Ghostbusters were men) is a special bonus. For me, it's irrelevant, as I care more about character design and the good work of the actors than about gender issues, which only serve to polarize and use cinema for political purposes, taking the focus away from art and of quality entertainment. Instead of using cinema to make politics, empowering women and feminizing men, films should seek to improve their stories, give credibility and depth to the characters, bet on quality. Otherwise, the feeling that pervades is that cinema seeks to do a work of expiation or penance. Maybe that's why I hated Chris Hemsworth: in addition to failing to be a good villain, he's amorphous for most of the movie and has the intelligence of a canary. Neil Casey doesn't even deserve to be mentioned: his work is forgettable. I liked the cameo of the original protagonists, but I regret they couldn't revive the original characters as well. It would have been something more honorable and meritorious.Technically, the film bets everything on visual effects and an ambitious, expensive, flashy and full of color CGI. This is something really impressive, and on the big screen it has a remarkable impact, but ultimately it gets tedious, excessive and turns the movie into a kind of expensive and noisy video game, an excuse for tons of expensive effects. The film misses the action scenes, which are absorbed by the effects and lack impact. The cinematography is good and impressive, but the editing was poorly done, and I think the cuts were excessive or badly placed. The soundtrack tries to honor the original by updating it, but it ended up making one of the most interesting theme songs in the cinema of the Nineties dull and monotonous.",Ghostbusters
63,leplatypus,"So, I saw the same movie 3 times (screen)",7,30 August 2016,"As GB2 was too much similar with GB1 and as this GB3 is the reboot of GB1, so it's indeed the 3rd time that I see scientists believing in paranormal expelled from NYC university and doing business busting ghosts, annoying the mayor and saving the city, meeting a giant walking thing in the streets and a big green Slimer! But finally I wasn't bored by the plot but more by the way of telling it: it took ages to bust the 1st ghost and to test the weapons; the following paranormal threat wasn't really gripping, NYC fever wasn't really felt but most of all, this is more an action movie than a comedy! I didn't laugh or smile very much and for sure it's not as acid or funny as the men's team! By the way, their cameo are cool but not as much as the last line of the credits that says for Harold Ramis and honestly, Moranis was much better than this poor Asgardian!On the other hand, I was delightedly surprised that this GB3 was a normal blockbuster without the awful blue / orange grading! Next, the special effects are really good and it's simply unbelievable to see how effects has evolved since 1984. At last, this female team is excellent: I didn't know them but as newcomers, they really act better than some big names as they really personalize their characters: each one has a cool, distinct, detailed character, stays open to those crazy beyond realm and share an excellent chemistry all together!For sure, Jones bashing is totally unjust and stupid but one final note about the sexual orientation of cute Dr Hollzmann, just because it seems to be also the great buzz of the movie: Frankely, the question doesn't really matters and as shown in the movie, it's useless to ask it: at work or between friends, you are together to do the job or to enjoy the moment so you don't really care what others do with consensual adult in their intimacy!",Ghostbusters
64,leonblackwood,Could have been much better! 4/10,4,1 December 2016,"Review: I'm really in two minds about this film, because it didn't look too bad and the chemistry between the characters was brilliant but the jokes were silly and the fact that there was ghosts flying around New York, didn't seem to surprise anyone. I did miss Dan Aykroyd and Bill Murray, who were perfect for the first movie but Kate McKinnon (Jillian Holtzmann) played the geeky role quite well and I did chuckle at a couple of Leslie Jones (Patty Tolan) witty lines. I think the main problem is that we have seen many movies with Melissa McCarthy (Abby Yates) and Kristen Wiig (Erin Gilbert) playing these comedic roles, so there lines wasn't surprising and the sense of humour wasn't that great. The storyline was pretty straight forward! Basically, Erin wrote a ghost book with Abby, which Erin wanted taken off shelves because her reputation got tarnished when the book was released but Abby still believed in the book, so she kept the book on shelves. When Erin finds out that the book is still being published, she hunts down Abby to tell her to stop any more copies being released. Whilst visiting her at her lab, Abby takes on a job, which was given to Erin from someone who read there book, and she is soon convinced that ghosts really do exist. After a few more sightings, Erin's book is sighted by her boss, Harold Filmore (Charles Dance), who fires her because he is worried that the book will damage the reputation of the highly rated school. Erin then joins forces with Abby and Jillian to fight against ghosts in the city. Patty also comes on board after calling the Ghostbusters, when she sights a ghost on the underground. Personally, I wouldn't have released this movie without the original cast, because they are what made the first movie so great. It still wasn't a bad attempt in reprising the Ghostbuster brand, in terms of entertainment and a great original concept but the writers need to push the barriers with the ghosts and the humour. Average!Round-Up: The person that actually surprised me in this film was Chris Hemsworth (Kevin), who was a unusual choice to play his role but he done it extremely well. Its still hard to look at him and not think of Thor but he has shown that he has skills to cover every genre. Anyway, this movie was directed by Paul Feig, who brought you Bridesmaids, which explains why he cast McCarthy and Wiig, The Heat and Spy, which also starred McCarthy in the lead. As he has directed McCarthy and Wiig before, it's hard to change there style of comedy, which has made them a hefty profit at the box office. That was the main problem with this movie, because we have seen this style of comedy many times before from the cast, which is why audiences around the world, wasn't surprised with the outcome. Now that the director used a lot of the classic aspects of the original film, it will be good to see were he takes the sequel, if there is going to be one. I just hope that he takes more risks because this film seemed a bit safe to me.Budget: $145million Worldwide Gross: $230millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their action/fantasy/comedies, starring Melissa McCarthy, Kristen Wiig, Leslie Jones, Kate McKinnon, Chris Hemsworth, Charles Dance, Ed Begley Jr., Michael Kenneth Williams, Andy Garcia, Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Sigourney Weaver and Elizabeth Perkins. 4/10",Ghostbusters
65,TheMovieDiorama,"A prime example of ""never judge a book by its cover"".",8,12 July 2016,"Rebooted with an all female lead cast, Ghostbusters is a remake of the 1984 original and is about a group of scientists who believe in ghosts and use their intellect to stop someone from unleashing the paranormal world upon the human world. Now we all saw the trailers, we all saw that dislike ratio (the most disliked trailer on YouTube) and we all saw the negative comments. I can't lie, I did walk into this film hoping it was going to be bad...but it wasn't. Not only was it good, it was actually the most fun I've had this whole summer season of blockbusters. Straight up this is a great cast, the Ghostbusting team have such great chemistry (especially Kristen Wiig, who I am a massive fan of, and Kate McKinnon), Chris Hemsworth was surprisingly funny and even the many cameos from the original. Speaking of cameos, there are a lot of easter eggs in this film that link to the original which many fans will enjoy. I've now come to realise anything director Paul Feig (Bridesmaids and Spy) does, it's just going to be great. The direction was great, the script was funny and the characters had depth. The visuals for the paranormal entities looked superb and the effects for the proton guns looked very similar to the original, which was a nice touch. The villain in the film was underdeveloped and weak but this is only a minor setback. Overall, this is a solid entertaining reboot with a great cast and a funny script that will delight newcomers and fans alike.Review at: http://www.themoviediorama.com",Ghostbusters
66,pmtelefon,A year and a half ahead of it's time.,8,10 March 2018,"If the 2016 ""Ghostbusters"" reboot came out in March '18 it would have been hailed as a great ""feminist"" moment the same as '17s ""Wonder Woman"". It would have been a hit and not a disappointment. That's a shame because the new ""Ghostbusters"" movie is a funny movie and should have been a hit. I was in my early 20s when the original ""Ghostbusters"" came out. I liked the movie then and I like it now. I believe that people that were 10 years younger when it came out really, really like it. That's cool. But why the over-the-top mean ""outrage"" at the all-gal reboot. Like most people, I see funny as funny. I don't care if it's male or female. This movie funny/very funny. I'll be watching it again pretty soon.",Ghostbusters
67,matthewssilverhammer,Better Than Ghostbusters 2,4,24 July 2016,"Ghostbusters is perfect proof that weak trailers and internet trolls should never be trusted. Feig and co. have heard the vocal hordes of overreacting nostalgia nerds and straight-up bigots, and has decidedly ignored them, except to call them out with a couple of decent meta-jokes placed within the film. Is the movie perfect, or even great? No; its unnecessary self-awareness and lazy character writing make it feel too slapdash at times. However, it's bundle of laughs and good-natured scares keep it from being the ""childhood-ruiner"" people assumed. For one thing, it thankfully isn't the photocopy that the trailers promised. Sure, it similarly follows some ne'er-do-well scientists on a hapless adventure to capture ghosts. Otherwise, much of its likeness is mostly found in its respectably old-fashioned structure and tone, along with some fun Disney's-Haunted-Mansion-esque FX and cartoonish practical sets. Feig used the passing of years to up the stakes in only the scares department (i.e. awesomely scary mannequin segment). And while I wish these new characters were more clearly defined than as just vehicles for plotting and humor, that humor still shines throughout, with a scene-stealing turn by Hemsworth as a pretty-boy dope. The smaller comedic moments are what made the original film hold-up for so many years, and Feig does his darndest to continue that style. Unfortunately, some of that forced reverence is its biggest distraction, leaving us questioning, ""Was this movie really necessary?"" It's packed to the gills with pointless cameos that offer nothing but annoyance, and the final battle is a hasty and uninspired mess. Luckily, the humor and cast make 2016's Ghostbusters colorful pop entertainment that's at least outshines Ghostbusters 2.",Ghostbusters
68,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"The new ""Ghostbusters"" has its problems, but none of them are women",5,9 January 2017,"The wait for a third ""Ghostbusters"" had been an agonizing journey of sound bites from original cast members and producers about who wasn't on board and when it would happen. No one expected an all- female reboot. Fans and audiences can complain all they want about this 2016 incarnation, but these women are responsible for the film's strengths, not its weaknesses.""Ghostbusters"" gets itself into the most trouble for the ways it clearly feels beholden to the original films. The script starts from scratch with the Ghostbusters universe yet packs itself full of iconic references to and actor cameos from the two '80s movies that it struggles to carve its own identity. You get the sense that studio pressure forced its way into ""The Heat"" writers Katie Dippold and Paul Feig's script, as if they had a checklist for the movie's easter eggs. Regardless, whoever it was that lobbied for all these unsubtle winks to the fans should've considered how miffed they'd be by a completely recast and rebooted ""Ghostbusters"" in the first place that no amount of breadcrumbs could sway their total favor. The story has to go out of its way to include Slimer and the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man, for example, and all they do is distract from the experience of the movie.Kristen Wiig, Melissa McCarthy, Kate McKinnon and Leslie Jones generate the core of that experience as the most original components of this blockbuster (alongside Chris Hemsworth's hilarious supporting role as the team's secretary). We've seen the Wiig- McCarthy dynamic for a good five years now, but whenever they get together with Feig in the director's chair, good things happen. Good awkward things. McCarthy's character is a little straighter and more boring than she ought to be, but Wiig shows why she does hilariously uncomfortable humor better than anyone out there, male or female.Yet no one will walk away from this ""Ghostbusters"" without remarking on the comedic genius of McKinnon, whose Holtzmann brings a much- needed playful energy to a movie that tends to fall into stretches of taking itself seriously or playing out in uninspired fashion, both from a comedy and an action/plot standpoint. She remarkably keeps the cast and the audience on their toes.Hemsworth as the legitimately stupid Ghostbusters secretary, Kevin, on the other hand, is the movie's best long-running gag. Hemsworth nails the blissful ignorance of his character to the point that even the dumber lines that he's fed come off as giddily funny. There's also the reverse gender-stereotyping component of the joke and the way it highlights sexist double standards by virtue of being a double standard. It wouldn't have worked had Kevin not been written as a whole other unthinkable level of stupid.The script also responds both cleverly and a little more overtly to the public outcry that took place when it was learned that the new Ghostbuster would be women. Characters Abby, Erin, Patty and Holtzmann are constantly trying to prove themselves and Dippold and Feig throw in some clever and extremely warranted jabs at these sexist detractors. Sometimes it gets too profuse (the villainous character, Neil Casey's Rowan, tends to throw around the word ""girls"" a lot), but given the times we live in, the real-life cultural context matters in this film.Yet even with the smart subtext and the way the comedy hits original and entertaining notes, the formulaic blockbuster structure and kitschy (by 2016 standards) special effects drag ""Ghostbusters"" down. The action sequences are run of the mill, predictable and most significantly, take time away from what the actors do best – make us laugh. The scenes that try to serve both humor and action don't make the movie funnier or more exciting, making it almost impossible to bridge the two components into the kind of seamless viewing experience that allows us to more easily forgive a film's faults.Add in the pointless cameos and references and there's too much slowing ""Ghostbusters"" down. It can never fully blossom into the unique reimagining it should have been. In the business of big- budget franchise movies, however, pleasing the fanbase is critical to the bottom line, even if it results in a lesser film. But if that's the case, wouldn't the version of the movie with a new all- male cast have been less risky? Instead we get the bold ""Ghostbusters"" that doesn't go bold enough; the one that won't please the most ardent of fans but does enough to keep them from taking out their pitchforks – and proton packs.~Steven CThanks for reading!

69,Vartiainen,Just... why?,4,17 November 2016,"Don't get me wrong. The Ghostbusters team as all-female. I'm all for that. The basic premise of this reboot is a lot better than a lot of others. This could really work.Unfortunately the script is pure garbage. None of the jokes are funny, the female agenda is pushed way too hard, the villain is not interesting, and it just isn't a fun experience.So... the story is pretty similar to the original one. Supernatural phenomena are happening across New York City and a couple of sidelined university professors think they have figured out the solution and are ready to start up a business to deal with the situation. Along the line we get forced gender jokes, callbacks to the original film, painful CGI effects and a climax that has none of the mythology of the original.Now, don't get me wrong. There are a lot of cool things in this film. The effects and visuals, for the most part, are pretty cool. I would have preferred at least some practical effects, but what we end up getting is not bad. All of the female actors are also talented. The script and the lines they're given are not in any way good, but they pull them off as well as they can. The fight scenes are also pretty to look at and quite impressive.But then there is Chris Hemsworth as the contractual eye candy, and his character is pure pain. The very worst of feminist ideal made flesh. And there's also the villain, who's so weak that I have problem even remembering what he looked like. The humour is also unmistakably weak, veering between forced chick jokes, unimaginative one-liners and callbacks to the original.This reboot doesn't deserve to exists. The original film is a cult masterpiece. A film so original, witty and captivating that trying to remake it is like saying you don't think Mozart is all that hot and that obviously even your scribbles are way better than anything he has ever done. Which is why this movie should be utterly forgotten. Because otherwise they might make more.",Ghostbusters

This begins with people touring a mansion in New York that's haunted. We then meet a Erin, a writer who reunites with her friend/colleague, Abby (McCarthy), a scientist to seek her help investigating it and McKinnon plays Abby's odd assistant, Jillian. Soon, they go into business as paranormal eliminators and try to save the city from ghosts. Jones plays Patty, a subway worker who becomes part of the team and Hemsworth (Thor) plays their handsome, dim-witted secretary, Kevin. Charles Dance (The Golden Child), Andy Garcia (Black Rain) and original stars, Billy Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Ernie Hudson, Annie Potts and Sigourney Weaver also appear. This isn't as bad as I thought, they tried to do their own thing while still pay tribute to the original and the cast, score & effects are pretty good as well.

71,subxerogravity,"I answered the call, and it was worth it! Really, It was it was fun and funny!",6,16 July 2016,"I do understand some geeks on this. I've been waiting for Ghostbusters 3 forever. Bill Murray is still funny and still relevant enough to lead the return of Venkman, Stantz, and Zeddemore, but tragedy hit, with the death of Spengler (Harold Ramis) in 2014. Part 3 would never be the same without all Four horsemen.Then Paul Feig announced his all female Ghostbusters, which I was fine with, because Melissa McCarthy and Kristen Wiig would star, so I knew it had a good chance of being funny (I have to say good chance because the last few McCarthy movies were not funny)But then that teaser trailer came out and showed us nothing. So little that It made me think it was going to be another McCarthy dud.Plus the character of Patti only hit home how this was not an all female Ghostbusters but an all white women Ghostbusters (Guess Maya Rudolph was to busy to be in it?)That became a real pet peeve. Despite the trailers getting better (As they showcased Chris Hemsworth's role in the movie to get the geeks off their backs (Weird that they needed to decrease the hate of boys by showcasing some beefcake in an all female Ghostbusters). I was still not into the role of Patti (even though I love love Leslie Jones).So here's the moment of truth and this is what it comes down too:From beginning to end the movie made me laugh. It's funny, women can be funny, It's not Bridesmaids funny, but what could ever be that funny?It turns out that the trailers do Kate McKinnon a big disservice, cause she was so funny in the movie as Jillian Holtzmann, an out of her mind Engineer who makes all the Ghostbuster's gadgets.I still wish Patty (or some other woman of color) was one of the core scientist, but once again, Leslie Jones owns it and nails. Absolutely HilariousI don't have to tell you that the comedic team of McCarthy and Wiig makes up for the string of crap McCarthy has been doing by herself lately? Cause these two bouncing the comedy off each other was great.Plus Chris Hemsworth as the receptionist being hired just cause he looked good in a tight shirt was perfect. Not as funny as he was in the remake of Vacation, but fun to watch for all you boy geeks who needed some beefcake to look at when you got tired of the ""all- female Ghostbusters""The Villain they go up against was super cool too. He was a super nerd that used technology to try to bring the end of the world by unleashing a Ghost vortex. If you seen Captain America: Civil War , it's like a funnier version of that villain.The special effects in the film were actually top notched, I really like the ghost creations and how they interacted with the live action. It's rare when it looks that nice.Is this all female remake as funny as the original? The answer is yes, it is as funny as the original. Some of the jokes are spot on for modern viewers and a great update that perfectly explains what today's Ghostbusters would have to deal with (The fire house is too expensive, scientist who believe in ghost work at community college and of course the internet hates them)Is it as good as the original? Of course not, it's a remake of a classic, it would never live up to that. At least it's not the same situation as the 2015 Fantastic Four film that had a black Human Torch and even though I love Micheal B. Jordan as the Human Torch and still support that casting, The movie was complete garbage. The All-female Ghostbusters was not complete garbage. However, their focus on being funny made the story unbalanced. The narrative was very weak. Ghostbusters reads more like a sketch comedy brought together with a common theme. Not that there was not a story it just could have been explored better.Keeping up with the times, Ghostbusters also works as a Superhero movie. The origin of the Ghostbusters was laid out more in detail, their connection with the villain is cliché to all Marvel studio movies(just like the End credits), the Ghost they battle are monstrous and city destroying, and they have this scene in the final battle in which the females act like the Avengers. I must admit, this does not work as well as it should, it really makes the whole thing corny as hell.Plus, there are a bunch of different versions of Ray Parker Jr's. Ghost busters theme. With it's small flaws I'm good with the remake of Ghostbusters but not fine with the covers and remakes of the original theme song layered in this movie. All crap.So if you think that women cannot make a funny Ghostbusters than you're wrong, no one should have ever remade the Ghostbusters cause it will never beat the original, but the girls are funny and it's a fun movie to watch, hands down.Very impressed.http://cinemagardens.com/index.php/2016/07/16/ghostbusters",Ghostbusters

Melissa McCarthy, Kristen Wiig, Leslie Jones, and Kate McKinnon all have great chemistry, and great comic timing, and never try to copy there male counter parts.

There were talk as far back as the 90s about making a 3rd Ghostbusters film where the torch is handed down to a new crew. Wouldn't that have been less insulting to the generations that grew up loving the originals than remaking it entirely? Did Ghostbusters need a reboot? Absolutely not. To the fans its almost like saying that the original wasn't good enough, we had to remake it and...once more, dumb it down for the new generation.It wasn't all bad...Kate McKinnon stands out as the only truly funny member of the crew. Chris Hemsworth comes in second as the absurdly idiotic secretary...but beyond that the cast lacks the definition of the original series.The gag's aren't nearly as funny, or at least they aren't as witty as the first two, going instead for the simplistic dick and fart jokes you'd expect from a low rent series.What's worse is the defense of the film, sure there were the woman-haters that came out online, but even the director stated that people that don't like this film are misogynists.I'm sorry Paul Feig, but there are a lot of us that are just sick and tired of remakes. Some of us were excited about the news of a new Ghostbusters film...only to roll our eyes and sigh with disdain when we found out you were doing a reboot.Let's stop this horrible epidemic in Hollywood and start turning out new movies again.

It proved to be a very long 116 minutes, within the first 10 I knew that I'd just have to grin and bear it.
However, I did like the special effects, by far the best thing about the movie. Nice to see Charles Dance, a fine English actor, in a fairly minor role. Bill Murray & Dan Aykroyd, from the original, make predictable cameos. Sigourney Weaver pops up, as does Ozzy Osbourne with the best gag in the whole film.

In case you haven't heard, it also has a gender reversal going on; It has Melissa, Kristen, Kate and Leslie as female Ghostbusters and Chris is their male receptionist. Kristen is a physics professor that wrote a book about the paranormal and teams up with her long time friend, Melissa, also a believer. Kate is the gadget maker in the team and Leslie is a subway worker that joins the group after witnessing ghosts-she brings the street smarts to the team. Chris is hilarious as a male version of a dumb blonde. As far as the plot goes, there are ghosts running loose in New York and the girls come to the rescue. Pretty simple. Now, I have heard lots of criticism about the gender reversal, which I really don't understand-sexism? And most of it is from people that have not even seen the movie. To me, if it is funny, that is all that should matter. I mean, what do these complainers want to do? Keep watching the same 1984 movie, over and over and over and over again? There are 5 original cast members that make cameos-6, if you count a bust of the deceased Harold Ramis-and they are not playing their original characters; one is a person that does not believe in ghosts, one is a taxi driver, one is a desk clerk, one is a funeral home owner and one is a personal mentor to Kate. There is also a cameo by one of my all time favorite rock stars. And as far as all the hate directed at the movie's cast, I have heard that the original cast has given their blessings and full support-I saw them on Jimmy Kimmel. The movie ends with a hint at future sequels-depending on box office results, I'm sure- and as the end credits start, there is a scene. In fact, there are scenes all through the end credits and even one at the very end, so make sure you wait for that one. The movie was dedicated to Harold Ramis.

Melissa McCarthy, Kristen wigg, Kate McKinnon and Leslie Jones are the Ghostbusters and there all alright in this film. I thought they had decent chemistry together and were sometimes funny. Its just I didn't really care about them as individual characters and I didn't think anyone stood out enough to truly care. Chris hemsworth plays Kevin there assistant and he does a good job as the funny bumbling idiot that works well with the girls. Unfortunately, though the villain is just very cliché and over the top making him completely useless and pointless to the plot of this film. The story in the film is incredibly simple and messy. It just has nothing to it, the characters don't develop at all and the main villain plot doesn't make entire sense. The script has some funny dialogue in it, it just never got me truly laughing too much. Also the dramatic moments all feel forced in the film.

The Chinese delivery guy was the actually funniest character. There was absolutely zero dramatic tension, which the original had that greatly accentuated the story. The story was more choppy and abrupt vs the original which had proper flow and pacing. The special effects were professional but oddly some the effects went over the letterbox boundaries; perhaps the 3-D experience was built in. I presume this was trying to draw in more females to view it as Chris Hemsworth is included for the goal of being a slab of meat as well as many stupid male jokes.

I'm not saying it's overrated or anything, I just personally don't enjoy it that's all.With that said, I'd class 2016's 'Ghostbusters' better than the original. However, as you tell by my rating, that's not me saying this is a good film. I don't believe it is. It's incredibly slow paced, with a very forgettable and untidy plot. It felt longer than a 116 minute run time, that's for sure.It's not all bad, though. I actually rate the casting. Melissa McCarthy can be hit-and-miss, but this is one of her more solid performances. Kristen Wiig, great in 'Bridesmaids' alongside McCarthy, is a decent performer too. Leslie Jones and Kate McKinnon are alright, while Chris Hemsworth is pretty amusing.I, despite not being a fan of it, still enjoyed the callbacks to the '84 film; as well as the use of the superb theme song. As for the special effects, they look good but none of the ghosts stick in my memory; both visually, but also in terms of the story. It would've been nice to have a standout ghost. Likewise with the film's villain, who is ridiculously plain.In conclusion, it does positive things but there are certainly negatives.

82,kirbylee70-599-526179,Is It Really That Bad?,6,21 October 2016,"When it was announce that there would be a remake of the fan favorite movie GHOSTBUSTERS the internet lit up. Fans asked why there was a need to remake a favorite film they found perfect. When they questioned the concept of making it an all-female cast those same fans were accused of being misogynistic. I even remember watching a show with the cast where when asked about those questioning one replied they were all just bunch of 30 year olds living in their mother's basement. Not a wise way to promote your movie to the fans you were hoping to attract. The question that never seemed to be focused on was the most important though. Was it a good movie or not? Start off tossing aside most of what you remember about the original movies. This movie doesn't play off of those directly but has small ties. Instead take it for face value, as a completely different movie with a different story. Going in with that in mind the answer to the question of whether or not it is a good movie is it's not all that bad but it lacks quite a bit.The movie opens with Erin Gilbert (Kristen Wiig) trying to get tenure at the university she works at. A problem arises when she discovers that a book she helped co-author years ago with then best friend Abby Yates (Melissa McCarthy) is still available and being promoted, a book about the paranormal and host hunting. Erin goes to meet with Abby to ask her to take the book off the market and meets Abby's new sidekick, tech whiz Jillian Holtzman (Kate McKinnon). While refusing the girls are called out to investigate a ghost event at a local mansion turned tourist attraction.At the mansion they confront an actual ghost and Erin is left covered in ectoplasm aka slime. When video of the confrontation with the ghost goes viral Erin not only loses tenure but her job as well. Abby and Jillian aren't far behind when they request more funds to continue their work only to find the institute where they work didn't even remember they were there and then fires them. Heisting some of the equipment they're using they leave and set up shop on their own. In their new home above a Chinese restaurant they hire a secretary receptionist in the form of Kevin (Chris Hemsworth), a hunk with no brain.The first customer that get is an MTA worked named Patty Tolan (Leslie Jones) who takes them to the subway where they confront another ghost. Patty joins the group after their encounter. Video of that event leads a local concert promoter to call them when another apparition shows up during a heavy metal concert. When video of this hits the press it is dismissed by an expert (played by Bill Murray). When he shows up to let them prove him wrong he's attacked by the ghost.More events happen, a plot line involving a longer intent on bringing ghosts into the world and another story involving the mayor of New York not wanting anyone to know that the attacks are real meld together as plot movers with little to add to the story, effects or attempt at humor.And maybe that's the first problem here. Too much is going on and it doesn't flow smoothly but feels like set pieces that are then connected. The first film had a storyline that connected the bits and pieces in a way that made sense, that carried along a story. This one feels more like bits and pieces that fans loved was stirred up with things each actress is known for to create something that feels like it's just there rather than something you want to rush and see.In addition to that the most surprising thing for me were the performances. Going in I honestly didn't expect much from Leslie Jones, a comedian who I think relies far too heavily on doing the same thing over and over. She actually gives a performance here instead. Kate McKinnon steals the show among the actresses of the team, displaying a crazy character that you end up laughing at and loving. Wiig, who I've seen give some amazing performances, feels like she's just sleepwalking through most of this. And, sorry to say, McCarthy is the worst of the bunch. I've loved her movies, loved her on MIKE AND MOLLY, but unfortunately she's becoming a one note actress doing the same shtick over and over again to the point it's no longer funny to watch any more. Come on, Melissa, you're better than that.The effects which took such a drubbing from fans aren't bad at all but they feel like they offer nothing new, no improvement over the effects of the original and that was 27 years ago. In truth while the movie isn't bad it just feels like there is nothing new here, nothing that makes it exceptional and it actually plays like any other average movie rather than an attempt to reboot a franchise. The end result proved this since it did decent box office figures but not enough that Sony plans to move forward with a sequel, something which they announced prior to the movie being released on disc.The end result is a mixed bag. It isn't near as bad as many claimed it to be but it isn't at all as good as the original. Its day has come and gone, youngsters who never saw the original will probably enjoy it and it will not be a feather in the cap of those involved. But if it's on the shelf, in the machine or available from a friend it might still offer a decent night's entertainment.",Ghostbusters

84,davispittman,Who ya gonna call?!!!,7,16 July 2016,"Ghostbusters (2016) is enjoyable and entertaining reboot of the original 1984 film. First of all, the casting is so great here! I absolutely loved Melissa McCarthy, Kristen Wiig, and Kate. I feel like Leslie jones deserves a special specific praise for her hilarious and likable performance, she was just so hilarious. ""I don't know if it was a race thing or a lady thing, but I'm mad as hell!"". That line is just comedy gold to me, and Leslie has sooo many more lines just that funny or even funnier, loved her staunch New York character Patty! The movie isn't perfect or like the best reboot ever made, yes, some of the jokes fall flat, but luckily the jokes that do work and succeed at making you laugh outweigh the ones that don't. Chris Hemsworth, while amazing to look at and drool over, didn't bring his best here I feel, but I feel like that was the scripts fault, his comedy didn't really work that well, but once he became the somewhat villain, he worked, I believe his villainous performance. And I LOVED how they gave all the old ghostbusters main actors roles/cameos in the movie at some point, Sigourney weaver is even back. RIP Harold Ramos. So all in all, no, it's not a 10, no not ALL of it works, but the good very much outsides the bad in my humble opinion, 7/10 for Ghostbusters 2016. Oh and CGI effects worked VERY well, very cool looking and didn't appear fake at all.",Ghostbusters
85,3xHCCH,"Just Watched It and Liked It, Surprised with All the Hate",8,17 July 2016,"The first ""Ghostbusters"" was a classic American comedy film from 1984. Written by actors Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis and directed by Ivan Reitman, it was about three parapsychologists (Venkman, Stantz and Spengler) who ran a ghost hunting outfit in New York City. This year, a reboot of this film with an all-female main cast written and directed by Paul Feig is released. Dr. Erin Gilbert (Kristen Wiig) and Dr. Abby Yates (Melissa McCarthy) have been interested in ghostly phenomena since they were in high school. After a period of estrangement brought about by differences in career paths, they are reunited when they were called to investigate a ghostly sighting at a local museum. Together with nuclear engineer Dr. Jillian Holtzmann and her prodigious talent for inventing weapons and New York subway employee Patty Tolan, they formally launch a ghost hunting business, later dubbed by media as ""Ghostbusters"". For their first major case, they track down a mentally-disturbed janitor of a local hotel who had been causing malevolent spirits to appear all over New York City. Never would they have guessed that this case would actually lead to a city-wide ectoplasmic apocalypse. Melissa McCarthy was not annoying here as Abby, unlike her early films. She continues her winning run following ""The Heat"" and ""Spy"" (also by director Feig). Kristen Wiig is so geeky, so self- deprecating, so delightfully funny as Erin. It took time for me to warm up to the unorthodox comedy styles of Kate McKinnon and Leslie Jones, since this is the first movie I have seen them in a film. They eventually do hit their stride as the quirky badass Holtzmann and the loud excitable Patty. coming up with their own comic highlights. The scenes with their pretty but dumb receptionist Kevin were so awkward and cringe-worthy. But only because he was played by Chris Hemsworth, the against-type casting actually worked to make this character hilarious. In addition, I found the scenes accompanying first part of the closing credits featuring Hemsworth were so embarrassingly funny. You won't see Thor the same way again. While this Kevin character could also be seen as feministic male-bashing, but I did not take offense because of the good-natured comic treatment.Being a reboot of a beloved film, comparisons, fair or otherwise, will be inevitable. Most evident would be that the comedy in the original film was more subtle and mature, while the comedy in this reboot can be gross and childish. The disparity of male and female team dynamics and interactions are very clearly noted. There was none of the sexual innuendo and smoking which were prominent in the first film. The ghosts of this reboot had the same colorful and cartoony style as the first film, but the technological advance of 30 years is evident to make them look polished.There was no mention of ever having a previous Ghostbusters, which may bum out loyal die-hard fans. However, I enjoyed seeing many references to the first film, like the logo, the old firehouse, Dana's apartment building (now a hotel), Ecto-1 (now a hearse), Slimer and the Marshmallow Man. I had fun seeing the original cast members (Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Annie Potts, Ernie Hudson and Sigourney Weaver) in cameo appearances, though too bad that they were not as their old characters. The late Harold Ramis was cited in a dedication at the end of the closing credits. There was also a very short extra scene at the very end of the credits when the song faded out. There was a mention of a name which can be recalled from the first movie. Was this just another nostalgic throwback or was it hinting a possible sequel?My sons and I had so much fun watching this light-hearted and happy- vibed film. I was actually laughing out loud so much at some pretty side-splitting silly gags. The interaction between the four ladies started off uncomfortable and rough. But as the movie got on, they really hit it off very well, and their individual comic styles gelled very well as a group as they spouted all their pseudo- scientific jargon and wielded their sophisticated proton-pack weaponry. 8/10.",Ghostbusters
86,pensman,Lame,2,27 March 2017,"First Kristen Wiig really looks like Jennifer Aniston to me in this film. Second, I really hope Chris Hemsworth got some big bucks for this film. Third, Melissa McCarthy needs to play other characters besides Melissa McCarthy.The first Ghostbusters was fun. Adults could enjoy the clever jokes; and your kids could laugh and giggle at the silliness. I certainly couldn't take my grandchildren to see this update. For one, it just wasn't funny. Why bother to try a reboot if you can't even make it fun. Louder doesn't make it funnier.Leslie Jones is quite good; and as far as I can tell, the only member of the cast who can act. She actually brings some depth to her character. Kate McKinnon is just embarrassingly bad. Even her mugging for the camera is bad. Melissa McCarthy can act: I've seen her performances in St. Vincent, The Heat, Identity Thief, and Mike & Molly. She can bring humor and sympathy to a part. Here she is a shrill one-note boar. And Chis Hemsworth is there to provide tongue-in-cheek payback for all the women we have seen in vacuous roles over the years. And there are some clever nods to the first Ghostbusters. But this film is seriously bad. This is the first time my wife looked at me and said, sorry, but I can't take any more. And she walked out.I didn't expect to see CGI of the quality of a Marvel picture; and it was OK, just enough for what it was: a comedy ""horror"" film of mostly froth. There was even an appearance of Slimer for the aficionados. But you can't deal with criticism with the excuse ""haters gotta hate."" Or here come the misogynists. It was a bad script with poor direction and some abjectly bad acting: Neil Casey and Andy Garcia for two; and a number of wasted cameos also.Maybe the comedy bar isn't very high anymore and people actually roar at Steve Higgins giving the bird to Kristen Wiig. But what do I know, a number of ""parents"" noted how their ten and twelve year olds laughed and laughed. Maybe that just says it all.",Ghostbusters
87,peterp-450-298716,Who you gonna call? Definitely not these ghost busters ....,2,16 November 2016,"""I'm Ed Mulgrave. I'm the historian at the Aldridge Mansion, and I believe it's haunted. If you could just come take a look.""There's one thing I'm firmly convinced of. And that's to stay clear of milestones in film history. A milestone is a film that isn't necessarily brilliant or an absolute masterpiece, but it made a particular impression on me. For instance ""Evil Dead"". For me that movie is a milestone because this was the first real horror I watched and I afterwards I wasn't haunted by traumatic nightmares. When I left the cinema hall after watching ""Grease"", I thought I was as tough and cool as Danny. ""Back to the Future"" remains a rock-solid classic for me. And ""Ghostbusters"" from 1984 was also such a milestone. It became a kind of a hype and it'll still be appreciated by film lovers after 50 years and broadcasted on television on Saturdaynight. I'm sure no one will remember this remake after lets say a year. It may safely be added to the list of unnecessary made and totally failed remakes in the history of motion pictures.The highlight of this film is the appearance of the original Ghostbusters actors: Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Ernie Hudson and a bust of Harold Ramis (who unfortunately died in 2014). And the funniest thing is that Murray plays a skeptic who doesn't believe in the existence of ghosts. And strangely enough, Chris ""Thor"" Hemsworth was the funniest character from the new cast. Funny, the majority thinks the opposite about these two last facts. For the rest, this is simply a duplicate of the original film. The story-line is almost identical (with some minor adaptations). The biggest difference are the special effects. They look sophisticated and are very impressive compared to those of 32 years ago (quite obviously) and a Ghostbusters team that consists entirely of women. I don't have a problem with that. But nonetheless it's still not clear to me why they've chosen this option.Maybe it's me or the fact that the nostalgic value of this film is very high. Perhaps the opinion about this film will be different if you're from a younger generation and you've never seen the first version. Sure, in that case it's still brand new and highly original. But someone like me who's part of an older generation and who has enjoyed the original film, just sees a duplicate, full of recycled ideas and reused objects, infused with not so humorous humor. Admit it, when you smile more about the fumbling of a hunk, who impersonated ""Thor"" once, this raises all kind of questions. Maybe it's because I have no affinity with the female so-called humorous actress Melissa McCarthy. I thought ""The Heat"" was horrible. And I pulled the plug on ""Spy"" after half an hour because I was bursting into tears rather than in laughter. Who you gonna call? Not these ghost busters for sure ...Nonetheless, it's admirable they persisted in making this reboot. You don't need to be a genius to realize that this version would be overshadowed by its predecessor and would never manage to beat it. And if you don't have a unique story-line and all kinds of objects from the first film are used again (the paranormal apparitions Slimer and the Marsh Mellow Man, the famous tune, their headquarter and the Ghostbusters vehicle), there's only one thing that remains : the interaction between the main characters and the humor. And even that was toe-curling bad and irritating. The humor used by Bill Murray and Dan Aykroyd was so natural, genuine and ingenuous. What's demonstrated here is so plastic and as implausible as the ghostly entities that flood New York City. Well, I stand by my first statement. Milestones are untouchable.

88,questl-18592,Busted,3,3 July 2021,"I have tried with this movie, honest I have. I've seen it maybe 4-6 times now and everytime I try to go into looking for something to like and at the end of the day there's only the two things there and they just aren't enough to pull this movie out of the abyss. Hemsworth steals this whole movie away from the female dominated cast, which is impressive and saddening all at once when you consider the talent involved and the fact that, the whole point of this movie is built around girls getting it done. The only person that is able to match Hemsworth is McKinnon. Her portrayal of Holtzmann is wonderful and brings just the kind of zany energy to this movie that I want.The rest of this movie serves as little more than a testament to the power of chemistry. It doesn't matter the budget, the scope, the script, the story. Chemistry is what makes an ensemble piece work and this cast has none of it. They just do not gel together well. Everyone is so focused on doing their own thing, bringing their own brand of SNL labeled nonsense into this that it never coalesces like the original did. McCarthy is just McCarthy, Wiig is just being Wiig, Jones is really just being the loud black lady and it's such a shame that she got wrote into that stereotype. You know, as I think about it, the more annoyed I get. This is a movie all about women and the only one here actually challenging stereotypes is Hemsworth! His portrayal of the dumb blonde secretary is priceless and no one else is getting even close to it. McKinnon is great but it doesn't quite feel like her mad genius is quite as groundbreaking.This is not worth the time to watch it. It's a shame because it feels like there could have been a good movie here. There are some fun ideas, the visuals are interesting enough but the utter lack of chemistry just decimates this thing and makes it feel entirely joyless.",Ghostbusters
89,a_chinn,"Okay Ghostbusters reboot is good, but not as great as the original",6,22 April 2018,"Reboots and remakes are tricky. Do you remain faithful to the source material, which then begs the question, why remake/reboot the film if it's already been done? Gus Van Sant's shot-by-shot remake of ""Psycho"" took this notion to the extreme, which I believe that was the point of Van Sant's remake. Filmmakers rebooting/remaking classics are left in unenviable either changing beloved iconic films, which often offends fan sensibilities, or remain slavishly loyal to the original source material, leaving little reason for the remake/reboot's very existence. The Ghostbusters reboot tried to do something new and found the ire of many fans. Sadly, a lot of those online fans turned out to be misogynistic trolls who hated this film simply because of it's all female Ghostbuster cast, but that's a pretty ridiculous reason to hate on this film. Melissa McCarthy, Kristen Wiig, Kate McKinnon, and Leslie Jones are incredibly talented comedians and deserve enormous respect for carrying this film. What I disappointed me about the the Ghostbusters reboot was that the script was not all that funny and it also lacked the funhouse scares of the original (you know, where it's actually scary in parts, even though it's a comedy). I think this film also suffered because the audience already knew the origin story, so watching the team figuring out how to use their proton packs and traps really didn't have the gee whiz fun of the original. Another element that made the original so fun was the great use of location shooting around New York City. This reboot is also set in the Big Apple, but doesn't make use of NYC nearly as well until the film's climax in Times Square. Generally speaking, this felt like a watered down version of the original, not unlike an inferior TV series pilot for a TV show version of a popular movie. But the film does have it's pluses, which primarily are the four leads, solid special effects, and fun cameos by the three of the original Ghostbuster team, Murray, Akroyd, and Hudson (Harold Ramos has sadly since passed away). Overall, the likability of the cast and the strong production values make this worth watching, even if the material if vastly inferior to the original.",Ghostbusters
90,TheOneThatYouWanted,Garbage.,2,7 September 2016,"Ghostbusters: Yeah, this movie is more than deserves of all the hate. There is noting wrong with an all female team of Ghostbusters but they are just not funny. It reminds me of all those other garbage reboots with zero character development and a thrown together plot. And even the CGI is bad. How is that even possible considering that this is 2016 and the budget for this film should have covered decent CGI and special effects. The original films were made over 20 years ago and the special effects and ghosts look more realistic. This film is such a waste. I don't even want to waste another word on it. I really don't. This film isn't worth anyone's time. I'm giving it a 2/10 because the guy who plays Thor was funny until you get sick of his one note character.",Ghostbusters
91,jadepietro,Not a Total Bust,7,21 July 2016,"(RATING: ☆☆☆½ out of 5)THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED. IN BRIEF: The spirits are high, even if they fall a bit short in this sporadically funny remake.GRADE: B-SYNOPSIS: More ghosts in the movie machine.JIM'S REVIEW: Rest assure that the misogynistic rantings on social media about the all-female casting of the rebooted Ghostbusters is for naught. While this newly minted version lacks the overall fun and iconic moments of the original (more on that later), the comedians do it justice, even if they become lost amid endless CGI effects by the third act.￼The gang is back to fight evil spirits who are suddenly materializing in midtown Manhattan. Only this time they, being the new estrogen-fueled Ghostbusters, take the form of an all-girl hunting party fully armed with proton zappers and funny zingers. The casting of Kristen Wiig, Melissa McCarthy, Kate McKinnon, and Leslie Jones, all talented and funny ladies who have incredible comic timing, take a standard been-there-before script and add needed energy and verve to the predictable. ￼Director Paul Feig never finds the right rhythm as he constantly sacrifices the comedy elements for the state-of-the-arts CGI, which overshadows the hi-jinks. (To be fair, the original film also had that same issue.) The effects are better than average, otherworldly but still ho-hum. The squad battles phantom after phantom...that's the essential plot. One set piece after the next becomes overkill, with little screen time to develop the characters and their relationships. As the film reaches its end, too many ghosts may have lost the war but they have successfully clogged this movie machine.￼Of course, the specter of the popular 1984 film haunts this version. It almost intrudes. Feig's walk down memory lane becomes an apt reminder of the superiority of the original. There is an almost desperation to connect both films which upstages this new film adaptation in comparison. While there are pleasant reminders interspersed in this 2016 model, the screenplay never deals much with the personal angle of the group. Most of the original cast members, including Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Sigourney Weaver, and the Stay Puff Marshmallow Man, do make an appearance to earn this film their seal of approval. While the film is heavily endorsed by producers, cast, and crew of the earlier franchise, the numerous product endorsements, including Papa John's Pizza and Sony, are also glaringly front and center.￼But the green slime is back in full force, the film's trademark logo and theme song are present, and the quick banter between the quartet exists, even if the sinister Zuul and its demonic body possession is sorely missing...as is that fond memory of Mr. Murray and Ms. Weaver's hilarious sex scene was an iconic moment in cinematic comedy. (However, the mere mention of Zuul in the lengthy end credits may be enough to plant another sequel in the minds of filmmakers and producers, even if this film is a bit of a financial bust with the movie-going audience.)￼Still Ghostbusters (2016) more than amuses, thanks to the actors involved. The four leads are fine replacements to the cause, especially Ms. McCarthy and Ms. Jones. Chris Hemsworth adds nice support as the dim-witted boy-toy secretary to our crusaders. But the formulaic screenplay by the director and Katie Dippold just doesn't give this assembled crew a ghost of a chance.￼NOTE: Stay for the aforementioned end credits to witness a cut 80's dance sequence with Mr. Hemsworth, who has all the right moves. It owes a tip of the hat to Michael Jackson's Thriller. Too bad the entire sequence wasn't in the actual film, a poor decision by its director, Mr. Feig. At least, some of it has been saved for our viewing pleasure.Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com",Ghostbusters
92,Blueghost,Entertaining and Funny.,10,28 July 2016,"Wow, I saw an Eight O'Clock showing in SF, and all I can say is that if you're a die-hard fanboy of the first Ghostbuster's movie, WHICH I SAW ON OPENING DAY, and you think that recasting the film was a bad idea (read that as a shot to your male ego or female hating female ego), then this is NOT, I repeat IS NOT, the movie for you.On the other hand, if you're a little more open minded, understand that the first film way back in the 80s wasn't all that funny to begin with, regardless of how superficially entertaining it was to you, THEN might want to take a chance on this filmThe real theme among users on the BBS and user reviews is that this film is somehow a ""man hating"" (referred to as ""Misandry"") affair.I saw no such thing. There is one supporting character who plays the ""pretty but dumb"" secretary, but that's a little ""turn-around is fair play"". The women actually like him. I guess the reviewers and other posters missed that.How unfortunate, and in this way disturbing.Someone says they ""contradict established continuity"". Huh? Illogical since this is a remake. By definition the continuity within the film IS ITS OWN. I guess the fanboys missed that. Oh dear.Someone claimed racism regarding the black woman. Admittedly she's pretty stereotypical, and stereotypes are parodied in media because they exist. But that doesn't make it racist. In fact she was probably the funnest character in the film.Someone else claimed they ripped off ""an original classic"" ... well, DUH! It's a REMAKE.And the negative comments keep coming. And, to be brutally honest, all of them stem from the absolute hatred of the women on the screen; from both sexes no less.So, with all that, what do I think of the film? I thought it was great.I didn't like the first one and its sequel all that much, and thought it was more ego than actual comedy. And, in fact, my very right leaning church going friend made that observation himself. An observation I agreed with after having been puzzled so long as to why I didn't like the film like a lot of OTHER males I knew.Original Ghostbusters was about the male ego. Bill Murry has gotten cast in roles that either skid near or veer into a kind of misogyny. Meetballs, Stripes, Ghostbusters ... you name it. That's not to say that that's who he is, but he set the tone for the first Ghostbuster's film.And this new one he plays the roll of the man he accused in the first film as ... how does one put it in a G-Rated context ... ""lacking masculinity"" (which got a great laugh from some of the audience). If he played the role of one of the bad guys that was in the first film, WHO WAS ALSO A MALE, then how is that man-hating?The film revisits effects, and is a little more clever in explaining the genesis of the characters camaraderie and other details, and, UNLIKE the first Ghostbuster's movie, this one was actually scary at times.And that's the things about the first Ghostbusters movie. For a film about ghosts you'd think there would be some kind of fright or horror aspect to it. But instead we got a bunch of matted in puppets via process shots that looked absolutely NOTHING like ghost of classic scary movies. In contrast, this Ghostbusters remake actually has a few scary scenes in it that'll make your heart skip a beat, but will also leave you smiling because of it.Here's another dirty little secret about this movie, and that is girls like to see men make fools of themselves to earn the affection of those same women. So what some men may see as man- hating, it's more or less a kind of endearment towards men, because men put up with it (mostly, and only if there's romance involved) knowing the payoff at the end.I think a lot of people missed that.The effects were superior in this film, the jokes were funnier, the acting was actually on par (if a bit energetic, and somewhat overstated in areas) compared to the first Ghostbusters, and the story was about the same in terms of tone.If I did have a nitpick with this film, then it's that the plot was a little too simple, and the villain just way too wooden. He was some shut in troll who was into the paranormal and all that it entails. And I did take a little exception at the Star Trek fan jab, because no fan of Trek would go near pseudo science, much less occultism, much less dress the part of one and indulge in the other. So yeah, that did get my hackles up, and I'm sure for a lot of other Trekkers and Trekkies who caught that comment.The villain was one-dimensional, and his scheme also a little one-dimensional. I think that's the worst you can fault the story. The film might have been better served had there been some more history, more of a plot that had been vetted by more than one bad guy thrown in there, but the film works as is.I just really can't imagine why there is so much vitriol over what is ostensibly a modern fantasy film.I'm guessing it's because the naysayers know it's a better movie, and just simply don't want to acknowledge that.",Ghostbusters
93,rgkarim,"Visuals ls Check, Slime check, Extreme Silliness Check",6,17 July 2016,"""If there's something strange, in your neighborhood. Who you gonna call?"" The answer to that question was so much simpler before this year. Ever since the announcement of the reboot, there has been epic debate about the quality of this upcoming film. Quotes like this will suck because it's not the original cast, or how dare they replace the Ghostbusters with females! Well putting the stupid sexism battles aside, this reviewer is back to share his thoughts on the latest movie to haunt the theaters. So let's get startedThe GOOD:  A fun story  Leslie Jones  VisualsOkay, lets get if off our chests right now, the story is not as good as the original. However, that doesn't mean that it's bad either. This installment's tale is a decent origin story that places our heroines against a deranged, albeit lame, bad guy with an obsession for ghosts. As simple as it is, the story has many entertaining moments and set a fast pace to keep those with short attention spans into the mix. While it certainly lacks the mysterious, darker qualities that brought suspense to the first installments, it still has some fun to it and sets us up for a potential sequel (especially the end credits scene) Perhaps a bigger topic of debate though, is the cast itself. I'm going to lay it out right now that I have no biased towards male or female actors, my analysis is based on what they bring to the movie. This assembled cast is notorious for comedy, and they bring their usual bag of tricks to the screen in hopes of getting you to laugh. Of the leading ladies, Leslie Jones was my favorite of the bunch. As promised in the trailers, Jones brings bold, brash comedy that nearly had me rolling in the aisles. While her loud rants and meme worthy faces are entertaining, I mainly enjoyed her sarcastic jabs, statements of the obvious, and bitter monologues the most. In terms of visuals, modern technology continues to be impressive as our ghosts were brought out in a grand visual display. While the make up and realism were tapered down, the ghosts had the wispy, ectoplasmic look that we often associate with ghosts. Fortunately the new technology allowed for fluid animation and very unique looking ghosts. Even the proton packs, and the assorted other gadgets, have some flare as well, with dazzling sound effects and flashy colors. These provided some exciting action scenes, again being a bit on the overdramatic side that brought nostalgia back. The BAD  Forced humor  A story missing suspenseAs I feared from the trailers, the biggest fault for this reviewer was the forced humor of this movie. If you remember the classic films, the writers produced clever dialogue, witty insults, and relied on the actors' delivery to provide the comedic punch. Not the case in this movie. Our SNL cast has brought their modern touch to the mix, which means less cleverness and more infusion of overacted silliness. Kristen Wiig and Melissa McCarthy deploy their usual stunts to spur out laughs, this means lots of prolonged banter, recurrent jokes, and sometimes overrated comedy. I know it's their method these days, but it would have been nice if they had injected some more wit into the mix. And Kate McKinnon had some well timed moments, but like the others the overzealous antics get stale and lost it's punch. As for Chris Hemsworth, well this movie attempted to make him funny, but failed immensely for me. Our writers focused on his looks being his selling feature, while belittling his intelligence to that of a rock. His lines can be humorous at times, but making him a complete boob (or better phrased idiot) got old quickly. Fortunately there are a few moments where the stupidity lightens up, especially in terms of the well-placed cameos, but for the most part the comedy is overstretched and overdoneDespite the story being fairly entertaining, it did lack a lot of the suspense and mystery that the other tales had. We know who the main villain is from the start, and I must say he wasn't that impressive. You remember Goza the Destroyer, or even Viggo the Destroyer? They were terrifying and dark in their control of the paranormal forces. But Rowan wasn't that well developed and his ability to manipulate the dimensional portals was a bit of a stretch even for me to swallow. Thanks to the comedic approach of the movie, the story lost much of its edge, the danger essentially absent until the very end when the action stirs up and the girls kick butt. Sure these scenes have little suspense behind them as well, but it finally gets things stirred up a bit. Perhaps if the team had traded some story for the comedy things would have been better, but Hollywood still refuses to find balance. The VERDICT Is Ghostbusters the worst movie of the summer? Not even close, but it certainly has ground to make up in the sequel that I believe will come. The cast is not the worst part of the movie, but more of the writing and direction they took it. If you want the Ghostbuster cleverness with well written dialogue and sarcasm, then you best skip this film altogether. However, those who are fans of the current SNL theatrics will surely find entertainment in this film. While the visuals are certainly impressive, I can't say they warrant a 3-D showing due to the lacking story and action. This reviewer does encourage catching it at home though. My scores are: Comedy/Fantasy/Sci-Fi: 6.5 Movie Overall: 5.5",Ghostbusters
94,invisibleunicornninja,Entertaining,5,31 March 2018,"I saw this movie in theaters. Though it is not a good movie, I was entertained.Plot/Script - This movie doesn't really have a script. Most of this movie is improv. This results in a lot of padding, riffing, and awkward pauses. The story isn't very good, and there are a lot of plot holes. Some of the jokes are funny, but most of this movie is extremely dumbed down. Characters - All of the actors in this movie aren't given very good direction. They all try to be the comic relief (which is partially due to the lack of a script) and it doesn't work very well. Most of the characters are pretty inconstant and idiotic.Sights and Sounds - The cinematography and sound design isn't that great in this movie. This movie doesn't do anything creative or original. There aren't many things in this movie that are done well, but it is a bit entertaining.",Ghostbusters
95,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of Ghostbusters,4,1 August 2016,"Mayor Bradley (played by Andy Garcia) getting offended when someone likens him to mayor Larry Vaughn from the movie Jaws. College dean Thomas Shanks (played by Steve Higgins), finding new ways to give people the middle finger. Sadly, these instances don't directly involve any of the main characters. And sadly, these are the only times I chuckled during 2016's Ghostbusters (my latest review).Anyway, they say good movies should never be remade. Such is the case here.Now if you think I'm gonna compare this patch job reboot to the original film from thirty-two years ago, well you'd be correct. In truth, Ghostbusters doesn't try to be like the first installment. Guess what though, that just makes it feel like an even more inferior product.Paul Feig directs ""Ghost"" and does what I feared he would do. He for reasons known, turns it into a Melissa McCarthy vehicle. The dialogue is grating, the improvisation is overwhelming, the lead actresses don't really click together, there are minimal laughs, and McCarthy's voice sounds like someone with a bad cold. Who you gonna call? How about the guys from 1984 instead.When Ivan Reitman helmed the original Ghostbusters, he created cinema that combined the eerie and scary with the humorous. He had Bill Murray providing one-liners and quips. He also inserted a foreboding, musical soundtrack to add to the film's epic statue. When the dust settled and the box office receipts came in, a perfect summer blockbuster was born. With this new Ghostbusters, nothing seems to be at stake. Feig generates something stock about four woman teaming up together as ghost catchers. Their story is laughably rushed. By the time all the apparitions and demons have been eliminated via Times Square (spoiler), there's no one to really root for.Basically with the first Ghostbusters flick, the people of New York identified with their heroes. A close relationship (and a romance) was formed between the two. With this modern day Ghostbusters, the girls with the proton packs seem alienated from most citizens in the ""Big Apple"". They do their job, snap at heavy metal concert goers, and complain about receiving lousy Chinese takeout. It just doesn't work. Bottom line: Kristin Wiig, Kate McKinnon, Melissa McCarthy, and Leslie Jones aren't at all cooler than Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Rick Moranis, and Ernie Hudson. I'm not saying that because I'm a guy. Heck, it's just a fact.Granted, 2016's ""Ghost"" does provide an upgrade in the special effects department. The phantoms may not be scary but they have a unique look to them (kind of like metallic cartoon characters). Also, there's more ghosts this time (plus the return of the Stay Puff Marshmallow Man) and more disgusting slime than in the first Ghostbusters. My problem with this current re-imagining is the weak yet tech-savvy script, the hapless cameos by stars of the original (Aykroyd, Hudson, Murray, and Sigourney Weaver), and the notion that the new ghost wrangler babes rent out an apartment (above a rundown restaurant) for $21,000 a month. Huh? In this flick's nearly two hour running time, they don't make any money in their paranormal profession.Neither scary nor funny, Ghostbusters concludes by mimicking a flash mob. It thinks it's a success and blatantly begs for a sequel by the time the end credits roll. Somehow somewhere, the great Harold Ramis is turning in his grave. Rating: 1 and a half stars.",Ghostbusters
96,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,"An okay reboot of sorts, but still has a lot to overcome",6,29 May 2018,"When it comes to reboots, production companies tend to have a fifty fifty shot at winning over newcomers and old fans alike. If it's done correctly, things will be amazing for everyone. The audiences will be pleased and the studio will make a profit off of their release. If done incorrectly, then everyone will have a bad time. And seeing that another sequel to Ghost Busters II (1989) was taking an eon to be made, it was later decided to just reboot it entirely. So how did this reboot fair? Middling to say the least for most. There were groups of people who were accepting of the finished product, while others were not content at all with how things were handled. There are things that work here though, it's just that those parts are scattered throughout a pile of multiple other problems. Some of which are difficult to get over. One of the biggest gripes hardcore fans had on this film was the whole gender swap gimmick. Honestly, that's not really a big deal.The plot of this story is familiar to those who know the original. Erin Gilbert (Kristen Wiig) is a promising teacher who ends up being rejected by her employer after they discover she once had written a legitimate scientific book on paranormal beings with a classmate by the name of Abby Yates (Melissa McCarthy). But before getting Yates to remove the published book, Gilbert ends up discovering an actual ghost with Yates and another cohort by the name of Jillian Holtzmann (Kate McKinnon). They also attract the attention of Patty Tolan (Leslie Jones), a person who is quite knowledgeable of the city's geography. Together they seek to stop the release of the random ghosts they find. The villain behind these random releases belong to Rowan North (Neil Casey), an individual looking to get back at society for his poor treatment of life in general. For the overall play out, its alright. But with director Paul Feig at the helm things should have been better. He did after all director Bridesmaids (2011) and The Heat (2013).Feig also helped co-write the script with another person by the name of Katie Dippold. Dippold was also the sole writer to The Heat (2013) and Snatched (2017). She has also written for the Parks and Recreation show. Even so, writers can have hit and miss projects. For one, the cast to this feature is exactly that. Only half of the actors who take center stage are actually likable to some degree. The two who make the viewing experience fun and fresh was McKinnon and Jones. Both had comical delivery and their mannerisms were unique. As for McCarthy and Wiig, both are not the greatest leads. McCarthy is winey and gabs too much. While Wiig is even worse with constant awkward dialog and unfunny lines. The same could be said for Kevin (Chris Hemsworth) who becomes the their secretary. Here, Hemsworth plays Kevin as a hunky dork and it's not really cumbersome to watch him act like a big goof. As for Neil Casey as the main villain, he's not bad but he receives almost no back story. His enthusiasm for the paranormal is only lightly scratched.Admittadly, Casey does resemble a distant relative to that of Peter Lorre. Either way, looks will not make a villain. The same could be said for the cameos of original stars Bill Murray, Ernie Hudson and Dan Aykroyd. Are they in the movie? Yes. Do they have memorable cameos? Only one of them really does. The rest are mostly throwaway roles and it's unfortunate. It just doesn't add much to the experience, especially for those who are unfamiliar with the initial franchise. However the special effects to the feature are well put together. Not only do the old gadgets make their way back to the big screen, but new ones come into play as well. McKinnon who plays Holtzmann is the tech wiz of the group and manages to create different kinds of paranormal weapons that help the ghost busters battle their demonic enemies. Some of which are ingenious by design. As to how on earth they were able to manufacture such a device and have it work properly all the time is still a miracle in itself.As for background visuals, the camerawork was adequate for this summer blockbuster. Robert D. Yeoman was the cinematographer for this production and a lot of it is well shot. There's no weird angles or shaky cam like sequences that will annoy the viewer. Yeoman has also worked on other projects like Dead Heat (1988), Yes Man (2008), The Heat (2013) and The Grand Budapest Hotel (2014). Lastly when it came to music, the film score and soundtrack were decent too. The soundtrack is mainly made up of the Ghost Busters theme (originally sung by Ray Parker Jr.) being performed by other artists. In the end though, the film score is what real driving force throughout the running time and much of it helps. However unlike Elmer Bernstein's or Randy Edelman's score, this one remains to have its own unique theme. Composing the score was Theodore Shapiro. He does take Parker Jr.'s song and make an instrumental out of it but that's it. Shapiro also scored Wet Hot American Summer (2001), Tropic Thunder (2008) and Central Intelligence (2016).While it may have a good cast of actors and decent looking special effects, there are a lot of obstacles for viewers to overcome if they really want to enjoy this soft reboot. Only some of the main characters are likable and the villain isn't developed well enough. Camerawork and music is okay but it only helps a little.",Ghostbusters
97,pc95,Cheap and Hackneyed,3,18 May 2017,"I cringed when I saw the first commercials of this ""new"" Ghostbusters shamelessly trying to be PC with the gender reversals. And after trying to sludge through this bland rehash, my first impression was validated. This is an as-usual Hollywood ""production"", bereft of new or original ideas, trying to repackage something that was 10x better 30+ years earlier. The effects are fairly cheap, and the story is a complete rehash with a fall-off in humor. Cameos litter the whole dump. So many of these older 80s movies that are getting remade are done in such cheap, unoriginal fashion, the movie industry had better take note. There is a certain disrespect for when newer remakes are so shamelessly thrown together. 3/10 -- Crud.",Ghostbusters

99,Zbigniew_Krycsiwiki,"""For Harold Ramis""?",3,16 July 2016,"Film tries to stand on its own, and be its own story, but it throws out references to the first film so often, and largely follows the same structure and progression as the first film, but with more farting jokes, and a lengthy discussion about the museum curator taking a dump in his pants in an early scene, before doing a variation of the library ghost from the first film, and kicking the leads out of the college they had been working in. Wonton jokes. Lots of wonton jokes were also added to the plot for some odd reason, and lots and lots of word salad. The first film used a lot of technical, descriptive words to describe some events, to good effect, but here, it seems like the writers just put together as many polysyllabic words as they could find in a conveniently located thesaurus. When that, in and of itself, does not generate laughs, they just have the characters shout louder, because louder automatically means funnier. There is a complete lack of location here, whereas the first film was obviously Manhattan. This film had no geographic identity. It could have been set, and filmed, almost anywhere (but perhaps that was the point)The special effects were colourful, and I did like a few of them, like Slimer's return, but during the chaotic and confusing climactic scenes, a lot of the ghosts looked like, as one character even described them as, balloons in Macy's Thanksgiving Parade.100% predictable, to the point where I felt as though I had already watched this, after watching the original, and seeing the trailer for this film. No spontaneity, nothing clever, nothing memorable. Most of this film just in one ear and out the other.As a final slap in the face, the closing credits say this film is ""For Harold Ramis"" Speaking of the closing credits of this already overlong film, they lasted for twelve minutes, and included scenes which appeared to be omitted from the body of the film, likely due to last minute editing in response to the scathing reviews of this film's trailers. Incidentally, before anyone claims that I am one of the supposedly sexist people who are opposed to this remake just simply because of its female cast, notice that at absolutely no point in this review did I mention the cast, only the screen writing, and the effects.",Ghostbusters

But no. We get a remake & what's worse, it's a sh*tty remake not a great or remotely good one!I've only seen bits & pieces from the original films & haven't been a fan of the series. But that being said I don't mind films like this unless the're done properly.The biggest down fall is the gender change in the 4 main protagonists! Why? Oh yes, because nower days when a film get made people HAVE to pick holes in things & change them around! ""Oh that's sexist, oh that's racist, oh that's homophobic!"" GET OVER YOURSELF'S! It really annoys the sh*t out of me when film makers have to appeal to stupid groups that portray what I've just mentioned! They did this political crap with Annie making her black I'm just because people don;t want her black don't mean they're racist! Hate this crap, I really do! But yeah the gender change was sh*t & furthermore unnecessary considering it was 4 men playing the parts! I also didn't find the film that interesting or fun in any way! It was sloppy, all over the place & badly slapped together! Like a messed up sandwich that has been made in 10 seconds flat! It was so boring & flat, I even didn't know what to say when the film ended! It was just grey! Can't find the words being honest! But that just shows you how much I disliked this film.The film itself did n't have any redeeming qualities about it! I can't think of 1 thing I liked about it being honest! I also disliked the sexism too portraying the men as being evil or stupid! Again, another thing I hate in the day & age when women want to be more empowered but put men down in order to make themselves feel better! Which is also a thing I hated about this film, though it was few & far between you still felt that vibe throughout the 90 odd minutes of the film! The end part annoyed me quite a bit!The effects weren't anything special & not really that interesting! So yeah! I mean they were terrible but not great & didn't get me interested in the film whatsoever! It even got me lost as I didn't find it fun! I overall didn't like this film & found it to be quite boring & sexist not to me mention flat as a wizards c*ck!Watch the 1984 Ghostbusters with the guys in it! It was & still so much better than this waste of space of a film! 1/10",Ghostbusters
101,bkrauser-81-311064,"Meh, It's Okay",7,13 July 2016,"Short answer: Ghostbusters is okay. It's not great; it certainly doesn't hold a torch to the original, but I can see the argument upcoming generations will inevitably make when they swear it's better because ""the special-effects are like, so much better"". The story is okay, the acting is okay the direction is okay and with the sole standout being Kate McKinnon's ludicrously satisfying performance as the bat-s*** crazy Holtzmann, this franchise probably has the legs for a trilogy before fading into obscurity. Good job guys! Way to aim for the middle.Wait you want more? Fine; the film begins with particle physicist and tenure track professor Erin Gilbert (Wiig) finding her reputation besieged by the republishing of her paranormal manual. Manual co- author and fellow academic Abby Yates (McCarthy) has been using the funds from the book to fund her research into the metaphysical but thus far she's only paid for one tenth of a mini- fridge. Gilbert confronts Yates at her lab where we meet the third of four Ghostbuster teammates; Jillian Holtzmann. Yates and Holtzmann harangue Gilbert into an investigation of a creepy mansion, they see ghosts, New York history buff Patty (Jones) is added to the team later, yadda-yadda-yadda, ghosts take over New York City and they're the only ones who can stop them.Seasoned scribes Katie Dippold and director Paul Feig play the film smartly, leaning into the girl-power pluck and merrily taking aim at angry internet trolls and Ghostbros. And you know what; it works! Most of that pre-release vitriol is sprayed back at the constantly irate internet community, largely focusing on dweeby villain Rowan North (Casey) as the film's punchline. He's even got a bargain bin hate lair that rivals the childish clubhouse priggishness of Dr. Horrible's Sing-a-Long Blog (2008). The relationships between the characters and the various male-dominated institutions (academia, government, media, private industry) automatically endears the audience to them. You want them to succeed, you want them to mesh as a team and kick some level 5 apparition butt.A lot of the audience's goodwill dissipates by the time the film reaches it's second act. Fortunately none of this is the fault of the main four but rather the appearance of the unrealistically imbecilic Kevin (Hemsworth) and the downright distracting ghost skeptic character, Martin Heiss played by none other than Bill Murray. More than just a cameo, Murray's character seems to be a simultaneously redundant shout down of the haters and a rubber stamp by franchise guardians. In fact, large segments of the Ghostbusters originators make an appearances which are largely organic or at the very least mercifully short. Murray's appearance stands as a huge discord that in retrospect feels rather insulting.Thankfully the film sticks the landing with a third act loaded with visuals that can only be described as a special-effects bonanza. Paul Feig's abilities as an action director has thankfully improved since Spy (2015). Sure he's no John Woo but there are some reliable dynamics at play here. Plus he's one of the few people who can make Melissa McCarthy look like a bada**. And can we please take another moment to appreciate Kate McKinnon again. While others fall into painfully unfunny voids of improvised drivel, every single thing she does and says is at once unexpected and completely organic. The obvious comparisons would be labeling her as a proxy for the late great Harold Ramis (I collect spores), though her character's inability to take anything seriously is signature Bill Murray.It's hard to say within the context of today's knee-jerk, chauvinism tinged internet tantrums whether or not this film is really worth the price of admission. Admittedly I was one of the few who initially bulked at the idea of remaking something I still consider near perfect. But even if Ghostbusters was our worst fears made real, it still wouldn't have diminished the original. I say if film studios want to remake, reboot or retool old properties, even old classic properties, I say go for it. Spending all that money isn't going to guarantee box office. As it stands however Ghostbusters isn't our worst fears made real. In fact in comparison to most, it's actually quite okay.",Ghostbusters
102,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"An Objective Review of ""Ghostbusters""- Highly flawed but VERY fun and enjoyable thanks to a wonderful cast. Undeserving of its venomous pre-release hatred.",7,27 July 2016,"It's an interesting experience writing a review while knowing ahead of time that within a day of posting, it's probably going to be trashed and down-voted into oblivion by people who not only won't bother to read it, but likely haven't even bothered to see the film that it's discussing because everyone had already made up their minds about whether they'd like it or not before it was even released.But such things are unfortunately to be expected when trying to give a fair, objective and unbiased analysis of what has shockingly become the most controversial film of the year. Something that frankly, I couldn't have imagined happening when the film was initially first announced just a few short years ago. Who'd have though that such a beloved franchise as ""Ghostbusters""- one that has brought legions of fans together for decades- would then cause the world of the internet to tear itself apart in a flurried frenzy of hatred and dismissal from so many people before a single page had even been written?But beyond the hyperbole and debate... beyond the savage attacks and desperate defense... beyond the spewing venom and the attempts at vindication... there's the bottom line question: Is the film any good?... ... ...yeah. It's pretty good. Not great or anything, but pretty good.Now, before you sharpen your pitchforks, hear me out! It's not a perfect film by any means, and it has a lot of problems. But is it really that hard to accept that perhaps people judged this film a wee-bit too harshly before its release?Years after Dr.'s Erin Gilbert and Abby Yates write a failure of a book trying to prove the existence of ghosts and supernatural activity, they re-unite and join the eccentric Dr. Holtzman in a ghost-hunt as part of a deal with one-another. After a video of their investigation goes viral, they are laughed out of their academic positions, but resolve to continue their research. Joining with New York Subway worker Patty Tolan, they form a paranormal-investigation company and are able to develop the technology to successfully capture and contain malevolent spirits. Now known as the ""Ghostbusters"", the group finds some measure of success despite many considering them nothing but frauds. At the same time, deranged social-misfit Rowan North attempts to use his own personally- developed technology to summon forth a supernatural apocalypse in order to get revenge for a lifetime of being bullied and ignored, and the Ghostbusters must go an an adventure to stop him at all costs.First thing's first, the film does have a handful of problems that hold it back, and I'd like to address those up-front. The film's first half feels a bit problematic, containing just a few too many hit-and-miss jokes and meandering a bit too much while trying to establish the story and characters. And the pacing on the whole is very wonky throughout. And this is a problem I think is reflective of many recent Sony releases- you can tell that a number of key- scenes have been left on the cutting-room floor for timing and pacing reasons. Same thing happened with their first ""Amazing Spider-Man"", and it can be a bit distracting. There's also a bit too much... slime for my taste, but thankfully that's reigned in quite a bit in the film's second half.But I'd be lying if I said those problems aren't easily trumped by the absolutely wonderful cast and very good visual direction courtesy Paul Feig.You see, when it comes to comedy, there's something very important that can make-or-break a film. And that's how charming its characters are and how good the cast's chemistry is. And my god, these characters are charming as hell and the cast have an absolutely wonderful chemistry. All four of our leads form a great, competent team. Kristen Wiig grounds everything perfectly as our lead, Melissa McCarthy is hilarious and serves as the beating heart of everything, Leslie Jones surprises with much more complexity than the trailers might have lead viewers to believe and Kate McKinnon is a revelation as the quirky but lovable weirdo that is Dr. Holtzman.Even when the plotting feels basic and the humor falls flat on occasion, they are able to keep the you fully invested, and you can't help but root for them to overcome the odds and save the day. Great cast.And Paul Feig's visual direction is top-notch. Very reminiscent of original director Ivan Reitman's first film, with enough confidence in his actors run wild, while also giving the movie just enough of a visual identity to be stylish without being distracting from the proceedings. Very good job.The music is also a lot of fun (save for that Fall Out Boy cover which we thankfully really only hear a little bit), the cinematography is gorgeous, the effects are quirky and have an old- fashioned ""Haunted Mansion"" vibe, the production design is top-notch. And even the 3D wasn't too bad or distracting. (They did the right thing and really only used it to add depth and occasionally make the proton-beams look like they're leaping off the screen.)Look, this film is going to continue to be hated and dismissed, no matter what. Which is a shame because it really doesn't deserve it. It's solid fun and while it never quite manages to measure up to the classic original (I'd rank it on-par with ""Ghostbusters II"", which I found similarly enjoyable but flawed), it still is a great time at the movies for audiences who are willing to give it a chance.I give ""Ghostbusters"" 2016 a solid 7 out of 10. And before you come looking for me for daring to give it a decent review, just know... I'll be changing my name and moving countries before any of you can find me. (Just kidding.)",Ghostbusters

105,SusieSalmonLikeTheFish,A cheesy light show stuffed with sexual innuendos and nerd culture,1,28 May 2017,"Like the equally cringe-worthy Suicide Squad, the Ghostbusters Remake puts up a lot of bright colours, thrilling music and the latest in computer effects, but in doing so, it only makes itself look dated and corny, something not to be taken seriously even as a comedy. But what surprised me wasn't even the technical aspects, but the bizarre focus on political correctness and feminism, which didn't really have any purpose in driving the story at all. All of the Ghostbusters are female (and I'm a girl myself, so I'm not trying to be sexist), and the only guy in the group is a man who makes Forrest Gump look like Stephen Hawking, a boy toy who gets hired mainly for his looks and accent rather than his actual skill. Meanwhile the film's antagonists and resident idiots are all men, including a ""supernatural debunker"", a sociopathic janitor and a closed-minded university professor, all of whom are made out to be complete jerks and morons. And don't even get me started on the ""ghost crotch"" scene in which the protagonists defeat the enemy. Why... just... why? With this film being in the 21st century, of course it tries to be as lewd and crude as is permissible for its rating, slipping in fart jokes, pen!s jokes, sexual innuendos, breast jokes and everything else under the sun, which seems to be trying to be subtle yet painfully obvious. We have one of the characters describing how ""ghost slime got into every crack of her body"". We have a nuclear device which makes a fart noise as a joke. I'm not trying to be some uptight prude, but this simply wasn't funny, in fact I'd be shocked if even an immature twelve-year-old found this stuff funny. It wasn't really offensive per-say, just stupid and dopey with very little originality.The soundtrack was okay I guess, with some 1980's throwbacks, but the introducing of modern pop and rap tunes into the mix didn't do anything to help matters, nor did the constant stream of nerd culture and the main characters' pathetic personalities. I hated the main leads except for Patty (Patty was at least tolerable). Their attempt at being quirky and eccentric just falls flat on its face, and we're left with an overweight geek who makes a crass joke in almost every scene and who seems to make no real contribution to anything, and of course the bleach-headed inventor who seems to be a rip-off of Harley Quinn from the Suicide Squad franchise, trying to act edgy and seductive in a dangerous way, but instead appearing awkward, mentally ill and annoying at the best of times.The trouble I have with this film is that it's frankly very ugly and tacky in every way. There's nothing wrong with comedy or with having a silly movie that everyone can laugh at, but this was just plain dumb, there's no way to sugar-coat it. Honestly it did have potential; the New York scenery was excellent, the camera movements were spot-on, the more minor characters were for the most part well-acted - so where did it go wrong? I think with Ghostbusters, its fault was that it tried too hard to be cool, only making itself geeky and lame in the process.",Ghostbusters
106,Screen_Blitz,A surprisingly pleasant reboot of the popular 80s franchise,7,16 July 2016,"After the success of the 1984 hit 'Ghostbusters' and its sequel, a third installment was a must. However, the third entry spent years and years in development hell and has the years passed, fans everywhere grew skeptical that they would ever see Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, and Harold Ramis battling against paranormal entities again. Unfortunately, Murray and Aykroyd both declined on reprising their roles and Harold Ramis passed in 2014. By this time, the franchise was just about dead. That is until Paul Feig stepped in as director casting an all-new cast of Melissa McCarthy, Kristin Wiig, Kate McKinnon, and Leslie Jones in what was no longer a second sequel but a reboot to the franchise. Upon release of the first trailer, the marketing of this film was met with overwhelmingly negative reception by the public, mainly criticizing the female casting of the main protagonists. But does this mark a valid reason for this film's hate? Definitely not. Following a paranormal invasion inside an ancient mansion, this film stars Kristin Wiig as Erin Gilbert, a Columbia University physics professor who's become a laughing stock by her colleagues when they discover her old book online about her paranormal encounters. Upon investigating an old mansion with her old friends Abby Yates (played by Melissa McCarthy) and Jillian Holtzmann (played by Kate McKinnon), the trio discovers a ghost which leads to them creating their team known as ""Ghostbusters"". Adding subway station worker Patty Tolan (played by Leslie Jones) to the team, this women are pitted in an off-the-rails battle against the paranormal that threaten to destroy the city of Manhattan.Like most reboots and remakes, this movie had only small chance of living up to the standards of the 1984 original and an even slimmer chance of surpassing the original. This doesn't mean however, that the film can't be fun and please fans everywhere. While the absence of Dan Aykroyd, Bill Murray, and Harold Ramis and their comedic charm may feel like a burden to the film, the new cast surprisingly manages to make up for this. Though their efforts on bringing in laughs are hit-and-miss at times, there is a fair amount of laughter and appeal to be experienced. Kristin Wiig who's working with director Paul Feig for the second time after the hit comedy 'Bridesmaids', delivers a few funny moments is fine in her role but as great as Melissa McCarthy who obliges the most humorous moment throughout the film. Leslie Jones is also occasionally funny here, though most of her jokes do not quite land. Kate McKinnon is not bad, but isn't given a whole lot to work with here other than babbling about scientific material. Playing the absent-minded team's secretary is Chris Hemsworth who occasionally offers some fine comic relief, even the portrayal of his character gets a bit silly. The film's best scenes lie during the action sequences featuring the ghost entities are fun, if a little over-the-top to watch. The ghost are brought to life in gleaming CGI that give the paranormal freaks a decent look, though can be frightening for the youngsters.Ghostbusters is a surprisingly pleasant and successful attempt on rebooting the popular 80s franchise. While the humor can get a bit silly and dumbfounded in some places, the movie is fun to watch and delivers some hilarious goods the midst of its flaws. This is not film worth skipping in response to the negative reception by the public for the female- dominated cast as this film does not promote sexism as many viewers unfairly claims it does.",Ghostbusters
107,Troy_Campbell,A funny and exciting modern update.,7,14 July 2016,"In recent memory, there hasn't been as much controversy surrounding a movie as there was for this female-led reboot, with both outrage at the gender swap and apprehension over a beloved 80s cinematic artefact being somehow ruined. Neither concern warranted the vitriolic online attacks of course, especially as we're talking about a light-hearted supernatural comedy, and, after seeing the movie (always the best time to judge a film in my opinion), it's pretty damn good. Not an exact remake of the original, but sticking close to the broad plot strokes, Ghostbusters '16 puts less emphasis on reinventing the story and more on injecting its own kooky spin to the inherently playful tone. There is an impressive range of gags working on multiple levels, some hilariously slapstick and others more subtly tongue-in-cheek, with director Paul Feig even squeezing in a couple of fantastic meta-jokes having a dig at the aforementioned fan backlash. Although this version is clearly comfortable in its own skin, it also slyly calls back to previous outings with cheeky references (logo! vehicle! HQ!) and numerous cameos, the latter ultimately a mixed bag though. At times it is also genuinely spooky (on a PG-rated level), the pre-credits sequence is an especially effective spine-tingler, however the larger the supernatural presence the less frightening it becomes. Where this flick hits its biggest homerun is in casting. The new evil-spirit fighting quartet share a wonderful chemistry: Melissa McCarthy's optimistically rambunctious Abby, Kristen Wiig's cautiously nerdy Erin, Kate McKinnon's confidently cool Jillian and Leslie Jones' assuredly street-wise Patty make a cracking team. McKinnon steals the show though, the long time Saturday Night Live alumni is a revelation in her first major film role whilst also nabbing the most memorable moment with a totally badass action sequence in which she single-handedly takes down a string of ghouls. It's certainly not perfect – the rote city-destroying finale and lame villain ensure that – but it's an exciting and funny adventure that proves to be a worthy modern update. And it's ten times better than Ghostbusters 2 ever was.",Ghostbusters
108,Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187,This film just keeps getting worse with age.,3,20 August 2016,"The cynical and creatively bankrupt landscape of Hollywood has resorted to making a 'reboot' of Ghostbusters WITHOUT any connection to the original movie at all.This is probably one of the most pointless and redundant 're-imaginings' I've ever seen at the cinema. Gone is Bill Murray's dry and charmingly smug wit, gone is Sigourney Weaver's charming yet to the point no-nonsense character, gone is Dan Aykroyd and literally everything else that made the first one such an 80s milestone. This reboot is as imaginative as a gender-swapped fan fiction of Harry Potter or Hunger Games.This has the creative team behind Bridesmaids, and some of the cast too. And Melissa McCarthy's woefully miscast in this film: she's not an awkward yet intellectually brilliant outsider like the original Ghostbusters team, and the miscasting doesn't stop there; Kristen Wiig has the exact same problem McCarthy faced, and it REALLY hampers the character-chemistry in the film.Besides some cameos from the original cast members, there's ultimately nothing of real value to this Ghostbusters reboot. And it wasn't the gender-swapped thing that was the problem: it was the disrespect and lack of reverence to the source material and treating it like an off-kilter 2000s comedy that made this thing fail hard (you can't discard a property's legacy like this).Ghostbusters is a reboot that doesn't care for its source material and that's why it failed in the first place. If you want feminist cinema done right, watch Alien or Thelma & Louise. Those movies respect filmmakers and audiences alike; I wish the same could be said for THIS mess.",Ghostbusters
109,pyrocitor,"""What year is it?"" ""It's 2040. Our president is a plant!""",7,20 July 2016,"In 1984, the original Ghostbusters anchored one of its best gags on the punchline ""This man has no dick."" It's the kind of joke the 2016 remake doesn't dare make (though you can tell Melissa McCarthy is just bursting to), for fear of the internet combusting in a maelstrom of irrational frothing at the mouth. But for all the vitriol it has attracted, whether for being Not Another Remake, or its all-female leads, it's easy to forget that Paul Feig's Ghostbusters is actually a very simple film. It's not an iconoclastic diatribe, or callous cash grab (no more than any other Hollywood fare, anyway). There's nothing strange in this neighbourhood. But, if you're in search of a breezy, dopey, and laugh-riddled night at the movies? You know you who're gonna call. Feig is enormously reverent to the original 1984 Ghostbusters, sprinkling in winks, homages, and buckets of slime throughout. In fact, it's almost excessive how much he leans on affectionate nostalgia here (one cameo in particular overstays his welcome beyond what we, or he, clearly want), as his remake is substantive enough to stand on its own. If nothing else, Feig mirrors the original's deft balance between sharp and silly, cheesy and snappy, to an admirable (and thoroughly entertaining) extent here. The plot, naturally, is an extraneous MacGuffin of a lonely, disenfranchised nerd seeking to bring about the apocalypse as revenge for his righteously indignant isolation (ahh, so that's why it's hit a nerve for so many online trolls), but the adventure that ensues is tremendous, punchline-laden fun, motivation be damned. It helps that Feig isn't afraid to go genuinely spooky at times - ghosts should, after all, be at least a lil' bit scary - and it only feeds into the fun. He's aided by some surprising solid special effects, which hold up even during a CGI-bloated 'kitchen sink' climax, which skirts *just* clear of the threshold of overstimulating summer blockbuster spectacle (there's at least two action sequences - most notably Kate McKinnon's big trailer moment - which are so flat-out awesome, they more than compensate for any looming CGI-overload). It's even paradoxically refreshing to see a film having so much fun with its 3D, as its daft ""let's puke on the audience!"" aesthetics work weirdly well with its vibe of cheesy nostalgia. There are, of course, legitimate complaints to be made, most of which echo from Feig's previous work. Like Bridesmaids, The Heat, and Spy, Ghostbusters is indulgently overlong and somewhat clumsily edited, toes the line of grinding the same gags into the ground (some of the more scatological ones of which flop entirely), and incorporates bursts of sentiment or character development into the broad comedy awkwardly, making otherwise crackling sequences uncomfortably laggy at times. The crass product placement moments meant to play as witty largely don't (though ""salty parabolas"" is an exquisite one-liner, context notwithstanding), and I definitely could have done without the deluge of Ray Parker Jr. dubstep remixes, too. Still, props are deserved for the film acknowledging its obnoxious shroud of irrational patriarchal hatred with only a wry, meta aside condemning YouTube comments. Instead, as with most of Feig's filmic output, the film's most groundbreaking gender politics lie in the film quietly doing its business rather than stressing them. There are no bombastic girl power statements here: just a cast of four women with uniquely drawn characters (or at least comedic archetypes) who love their jobs and aren't entangled in superfluous love subplots. And the punchline? None of this undercuts how hugely funny they are. Bam. Mic drop. Kristen Wiig trots out her trademark neurotic motormouth schtick to endearing effect once more, but it'd be growing dangerously stale and forgettable without such flamboyant circumstances to react to (her bug-eyed ""GHOSTS ARE REAL"" histrionics remind how funny she can be when taking risks, though). Melissa McCarthy is more thankless as the Dan Ackroyd straight man, but although the plot labours to give her things to do (ghostly possession, etc.), her refined acidic chirpiness by itself is already a winner. But it's in the film's new SNL recruits where the real magic happens. Kate McKinnon's deranged gadgetmaster Holtzmann is such an outrageously, unpredictably funny live wire, she might steal the entire summer along with the show here, while Leslie Jones may be stuck with a politically dubious working class stereotype, but she owns it with her ferocious energy and barrage of unexpectedly funny one-liners. Chris Hemsworth's cheery doofus secretary Kevin is funnier than he has any right to be, as Hemsworth showcases an unprecedented affinity for making the most one-note gags unreasonably hilarious. Finally, keep your eyes peeled for the delightfully intimidating Charles Dance as Wiig's crusty dean and Andy ""Never compare me to the mayor from Jaws!"" Garcia, while cameos from Deadpool's Karan Soni and The Office's Zach Woods bag many of the film's best gags - which is high praise indeed. Ghostbusters is not perfect, and comparisons to the iconicity of the original are a moot point. It is, however, an energetically goofy, tremendously fun romp, fuelled by a team of talented comedians who are just fun to hang out with, let alone watch trap ghosts. And that's all we really need from it. Those aforementioned scathing internet condemnations? Busting 'em makes me feel good. -7/10",Ghostbusters
110,Pumpkin_Man,Very Fun Tribute to the Original Classic!!!,10,19 July 2016,"I'm proud to say that I'm one of the few people that really enjoyed this new Ghostbusters film. This review will contain spoilers! There were a few jump scare moments, but the majority of the movie was a comedy. I love both Kristen Wiig and Melissa McCarthy, so I was pretty happy that they were both together again in this hilarious reboot.Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Sigourney Weaver, Annie Potts, and Ernie Hudson all had cameos. (It felt very similar to The Brady Bunch Movie)Dr. Erin Gilbert (Kristen Wiig) is a teacher at college but her reputation is at stake when a book which posits the existence of paranormal phenomenon such as ghosts is republished and being sold online by Erin's friend, Abby Yates (Melissa McCarthy) she tries to put a stop to it. In exchange for getting the book out of publication, she agrees to assist Yates and her new assistant, Holtzmann on a paranormal investigation. They all see and witness a malevolent ghost. This makes them want to continue their research and become 'Ghostbusters' Holtzmann creates gadgets that allow them to capture ghosts. The villain that is unleashing all these ghosts is a man named Rowan, an occultist who wants to bring about the apocalypse. Some of the CGI was pretty cheesy. If you watch it with an open mind, you'll hopefully really enjoy it. I highly recommend GHOSTBUSTERS!!!",Ghostbusters

I never had high expectations watching this movie, but the cast have made some good movies, so I was hopeful. Kristen Wiig was the best thing about this movie, Melissa McCarthy is occasionally good, but seems to be turning into the female Will Ferrell, and that is not a compliment. While not being the worst remake I've ever seen, it was bad. Four female ghost hunters instead of four male, a male secretary instead of a female, and apart from that just new CGI which made you wish for the original.

So I was fairly indifferent about the prospect of a remake.The plot is similar, some ghosts turn up and some nerdy types decide to bust them.Overall I found this movie pretty good. It is funny in a lot of the right places, the characters are quirky and the plot splutters along OK.There are lots of nods to the original, which start off as fun but get a bit tedious. This is the root of all my problems with this movie. Things that start off fun tend to be flogged to death. Most notably Chris Hemsworth's character which has some excellent comic moments but is just taken way passed tedious.The same goes for the action. The final sequence is more a kin to a Jackie Chan movie and just felt too much. This is a pretty average movie (I don't mean that in a bad way) the extra action is probably going to be appreciated by a younger audience - which this film is aimed at - but I would have preferred something a little subtler.If this comes on at Christmas after dinner then this will be perfect viewing.",Ghostbusters
116,PartialMovieViewer,The Spoiler is Between the Beginning and Ending,1,2 October 2016,"Ghostbusters 2016 redefines the American Comedy/Mystery genre.

I am so glad I saw this on my TV...fast forward and mute switches are beautiful things. Look 'waste of money' in the dictionary and you will find, 'Hollywood Major Motion Picture.' I am getting so tired of PC being squirted out of Hollywierd trumping quality entertainment. Movies should be fun and not lessons of social twaddle that is only current for present generations and laughed-at, decades later. Give me a break.

In this remake/reboot, the visuals and weapons get an upgrade, and that's about it. If they truly wanted to make a ""Ghostbusters with women,"" then the characters shouldn't have been so interchangeable with the originals. I understand the need to maintain the parallels to the original, but these characters come off more like men in women's bodies than women who have their own, unique challenges and approaches to solving problems.If anything, Ghostbusters (2016) shows how extraordinary the comedy and special effects of the original Ghostbusters (1984) were. While the original usually earned its laughs with a wink, this remake had jokes that mostly relied upon awkward and uncomfortable situations or faux pas. I get that sometimes the improvisational nature of comedy can work for people who got their start on Saturday Night Live (as 3/4 of the cast has). But when it seems like the camera was left on to capture random moments/outtakes/bloopers that made it into the final movie, the 4th wall is broken, and the illusion of the film fails.Despite all this, the movie itself is mostly entertaining. Even if it heavily borrowed from the original, then it still meant you were watching the original in some form. And the original was entertaining. Some of the plot points were tightened up a bit, and the city of New York felt more like a character than a backdrop, both of which I appreciated. The cameos from the original cast were fun but mostly unnecessary. I can only hope that the sequel (if it is ever made at all) does a better job of taking its women seriously.An interchangeable and weaker ""Rule 63"" version of the original, I give Ghostbusters 2.5 stars out of 5.",Ghostbusters

120,RforFilm,"With a slow pace, hit and miss jokes and a copy of the original story, this new Ghostbusters is something strange in the neighborhood",4,15 July 2016,"When Sony got the idea to reboot Ghostbusters, I can't think of another movie that got so much controversy and backlash online. The comment sections of YouTube and countless forums were just full of people proclaiming ""Your ruining our childhoods"" or ""CASH GRAB, CASH GRAB!"". Even before the first trailer (the same video that is the most disliked video in YouTube history) hit the scene, it was clear that people had already made their opinions that the movie would be bad even without seeing what was in it. On the other side were hard supporters that would play the trump card that if you didn't like the new movie, then you're automatically sexist. It seems that while Captain America: Civil War was in theaters, the Internet was in the middle of it's own Civil War over Ghostbusters. I'll say immediately that while I was not on the hate train, I was feeling uneasy about a reboot. Looking back at the original (which I've already reviewed), Not only is the 1984 film great, but it's one of the greatest movies of all time. Considering its combination of genius writing and smart adlibbing, the odds of lightning striking twice for a reboot is a billion to one odds. Let's see if Ghostbusters at least came close.Dr. Erin Gilbert (played by Kristen Wiig) is a Colombia teacher who teaches physics. As she is preparing for tenure, she discovers an old book she's written about the existence of the paranormal is for sale online. She confronts her coauthor, Dr. Abby Yates (played by Melissa McCarthy) who is still studying ghosts along with a crazy inventor Dr. Jillian Holtzmann (played by Kate McKinnon). The three agree to examine a recent haunting at an old mansion, where they encounter a ghost. They fail in capturing it, but that excites them enough to go out on their own when they all lose their teaching jobs. Their next assignment is from a MTA subway worker Patty Tolan (played by Leslie Jones). They test out a proton pack and get a recording, but they are dismissed as being a hoax. When Patty joins, the group continues to develop their equipment until they are called to a local heavy metal concert where they show up in full gear and suits. They capture the ghost and receive mass attention. Once their secretary Kevin Beckman (played by Chris Hemsworth) gets possessed, he activates a machine that allows thousands of ghosts to invade New York, leaving it up to the Ghostbusters. Now that this reboot is out, I can say that the movie is defiantly not the disaster that many people thought this would be. However, it's also not a good movie. I can only describe the experience as a total ""meh"". Much of it has to do with the fact that while the Ghostbusters themselves are fine, the movie Ghostbusters just isn't good. It's clear that director Paul Feig did his best to hire some funny women, and they are. The chemistry between these ladies really shows (with the exception of Kate McKinnon who is hit or miss).The story of these underdogs rising to the occasion is too close to the original. Though it's not telling the same story, it's structures very similar, so if you've seen the original, your likely to already know what's going to happen (even if you haven't, it's underdog story feels very bland).The effects of the ghosts are also hit and miss as while some like Slimer and some balloon creatures look neat, the rest still look too obviously CGI. Finally as a comedy, that too ishit and miss, but it's not the proper humor for a Ghostbusters movie. The original was very quick and witty, while a lot here can go on too long and are even too low brow. A good example is a Patrick Swayze joke (it references Ghost) that at first was funny, but they go one another minute and again to describe the joke. This is where you needed an editor. Speaking of which, while not a long movie, this does feel surprisingly slow-paced up until the ending, so I could imagine several kids feeling board. I'll give this four Slimers out of ten. Paul Feig may have understood how to get the right look of a Ghostbusters movie that combines laughs with scares, he does not have the right pace nor enough of an original story to separate it from the original. On it's own, its meh, but even lower when compared to the 1984 classic. I can't really blame this movie as no matter who was in the suits, it's just never going to match the genius of Peter, Ray, Egon, and Winston. So who am I gonna call?

After New York City experiences a surge in supernatural activity, four women join forces to stop these ghostly threats. Abby Yates(Melissa McCarthy), Erin Gilbert(Kristen Wiig), Jillian Holtzmann(Kate McKinnon) & Patty Tolan(Leslie Jones) are the four women. They call themselves the Ghostbusters. Ghostbusters is an awesome movie. I have no idea why this film was embroiled in so much controversy. Having an all-female cast, does not disrespect the original Ghostbusters(1984) in any way. I am so glad that we got to watch another Ghostbusters movie, after so many years. Director Paul Feig, has successfully introduced the Ghostbusters to a new generation. This film will make you guffaw uncontrollably, just like Ghostbusters(1984) & Ghostbusters II(1989) did. The visual effects are superb. All the scenes involving the Ghostbusters' encounters with ghosts are a treat to watch, especially in 3D. The actors' performances, are the highlight of the film. Melissa McCarthy is outstanding as Abby Yates. Kristen Wiig is spectacular as Erin Gilbert. Kate McKinnon is excellent as Jillian Holtzmann. Leslie Jones is hysterical as Patty Tolan. McCarthy, Wiig, McKinnon & Jones have the same effortless chemistry & camaraderie that, Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis & Ernie Hudson had in Ghostbusters(1984) & Ghostbusters II(1989). Chris Hemsworth is hilarious as Kevin. This is completely different from any other role, Hemsworth has played before. Neil Casey is good as Rowan North. Karan Soni, Ed Begley Jr., Charles Dance, Andy Garcia & Cecily Strong are impressive as Bennie, Ed Mulgrave, Harold Filmore, Mayor Bradley & Jennifer Lynch, respectively.

127,bankofmarquis,Pretty tame - could have used more zaniness,7,17 July 2016,"I am a big fan of the 1984 Bill Murray/Dan Akroyd/Harold Ramis GHOSTBUSTER's film. So when they announced that they were making a new one, I was skeptical, but with talents like Kristen Wiig, Melissa McCarthey and Kate McKinnon in the mix, I was cautiously optimistic.And that optimism was rewarded - for the most part. It is a fun action/comedy with good, watchable performances by the 4 leads, but didn't go far enough to be truly unique. It was funny, not hilarious. Interesting, not quirky. Fast paced, yet safe.As the titular GHOSTBUSTERS of this film, director Paul Feig (Bridesmaids) assembles an all-star quartet: Melissa McCarthy (who dials it down a bit in this film - which is good), Kristen Wiig, who plays it pretty straight (except for a scene in a restaurant where she goes full-on crazy, which is fun). Leslie Jones does what Leslie Jones does - loud and angry (which is a little too ""one-note"" for my tastes). The standout in this group is Kate McKinnon's Jillian Holtzman. Her character is unique and quirky and my eyes were glued to her whenever she was on the screen. I could have used more of her - and her quirkiness - from others on the screen, especially the supporting characters.The problem with this film is that the supporting characters are all pretty bland. Gone is the Annie Potts, William Atherton's (Walter Peck) and (especially) Rick Moranis' quirkiness of the first film. In their place is pretty generic Neil Casey (as the villain). He just wasn't interesting enough and I think this movie needed him to be more interesting.And, in the end, that's my major issue with this film. It didn't push the envelope enough and, ultimately, except for the 4 leads, no else is interesting enough to watch.There are some fun cameos in this - from pretty much all of the original cast (except Rick Moranis) and the likes of Andy Garcia, Cecily Strong, Steve Higgins show up briefly and were all too tame. I would have liked to have seen them all ""go off"", but they kept the restraints on (Higgins tried, but it wasn't far enough). And, I guess that's my issue, in the end. This film seemed ""safe"". McCarthy and Wiig's performances seemed ""safe"". The cameos were ""safe"", even Chris Hemsworth's dimwit secretary went only so far, where he needed to push the envelope.So, did I enjoy it? Yes, I did. Is it worth seeing? Sure. But, ultimately, what leaves me dissatisfied is that this is a ""good"" film, it had the potential to be ""very good"" (or, maybe ""great""), they just didn't trust themselves to go far enough.7 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (of Marquis)",Ghostbusters
128,Ruskington,Who ya gonna call? Patriachbusters!,1,31 October 2019,"When I first watched the original Ghostbusters way back when, all I could think about was how damn sexist it all was. I mean, the idea that only MEN can catch ghosts and that women should be consigned to secretarial roles or portrayed as damsels in distress is just so triggering. What was this, 1984 or 1684? So imagine my delight when I found out that the pariahs of gender equality Paul Feig and Katie Dippold had decided to make reparations with an all-female remake. Don't get me wrong, I'm not totally satisfied with it- I was hoping to see at least one nonbinary and one disabled Ghostbuster- but we all know social justice can be a slow process.The cast is truly excellent and extremely well-conceived. First, we have the slightly-pretty-but-not-so-pretty-she-might-make-female-viewers-feel-inadequate one played by Kristen Wiig. Then we have the fat-yet-funny-and-smart-and-confident one played by the incredibly versatile and Oscar-worthy Melissa McCarthy. Then of course we have the quirky-autistic-spectrum-undercut-hairdo-nerdy one with her non-stop hilarity and sardonic one-liners. And where would we be without the empowered-outspoken-black one with her insightful dialogue and stereotype-busting placid demeanour? This all-star cast of esteemed thespians are Hollywood's answer to the Suffragettes.But without doubt the star of the show is the incredible Chris Hemsworth who takes a selfless stand against the patriachy by showing the world that men are actually useless (except as eye-candy for middle-aged spinsters) and should be sidelined while the women take care of business. That bit where he thought he heard through his eyes instead of his ears was so funny I actually laughed out loud LOL rofl.The plot is so complex and ingenious that it's not really possible to explain in words, but the basic premise is this: there are loads of ghosts in NYC, not sure why, but there's kind of a big X up in the sky that they're attracted to or something and the little weird man is trying to get them all together, not sure why, and it's up to the Patriachbusters to stop them using equipment that the neuroatypical sciency one created despite having no funding or raw materials and in the end the fat funny one falls into some kind of vortex chamber thing and the pretty but not too pretty one jumps in and rescues her on some kind of bungee cord thing and also the Marshmallow man is there again, not sure why, and all the while the empowered black one is saying things she heard on Def Jam Comedy in the nineties for no apparent reason.Oh and the special effects are just incredible. Considering that the editing was clearly done by a 13-year old using an early version of Windows Movie Maker, the final result looks great. The use of green lights and blue lights and red lights and smoke all doing swirly things together was just so original and cutting edge. Slimer and his girlfriend (did I just assume her/his gender?) were particularly impressive- probably some of the best CGI I've seen since the second series of Scooby Doo.One of the most important movies ever made. don't let any bigots mansplain to you that it isn't.",Ghostbusters
129,spookyrat1,Remakes Do Need to be Refreshed!,6,30 September 2020,"This is an entertaining enough and dare I say it, family - friendly version of the original Ghostbusters. I liked the 4 woman team and found the Kristen Wiig character, especially appealing. Chris Hemsworth didn't disappoint either with his amusing support role. It's really sad that there is a largely male element of the movie-going public that is misogynistic and carried out an extremely toxic anti-female campaign against the movie.My main problem with Ghostbusters is that the plot is much too similar to the original. So Ghostbusters 2016 is virtually the same as Ghostbusters 1984, except it has gender-swapped characters, rejigged dialogue and predictably, jacked up special effects scenes. Fair to add that it suffers from the lack of a Bill Murray type character, continually dropping those droll one-liners that he excels in delivering.Take the example of The Magnificent Seven sequel, which also came out in 2016. Yes, it has the structure and feel of the original, but the Seven are quite different the second time around. The Mexican village becomes an American town and there is a strong female character added. Too many of the 2016 Ghostbuster scenes seemed to be extrapolated straight from the original movie, with New York again being the central location of the storyline.Director Paul Feig has a great record creating films with strong female characters, but I'm not sure he was the bloke to be helming a near $150 million effects - driven blockbuster, which lacked a great deal of the snappy dialogue, usually associated with his movies. Ghostbusters ends up being, an overly respectful, somewhat bland homage to the 1984 original. Further evidence I'm sure, to strengthen the truism of letting originals stand alone, unless they can genuinely be improved upon, by adopting a completely fresh take of the material.",Ghostbusters

131,aesgaard41,Not based in any sort of reality,2,23 October 2016,"I'm a big fan of ghosts and haunted house movies. When they're scary, they're wonderful. When, they're funny, they can be charming. When they can be funny and scary, it can be a miracle. Unlike ""Beetlejuice"" and the original ""Ghostbusters,"" this movie is a disappointment. It could have had so much potential. I really tried to like this movie. It had a few funny moments, some memorable quotes, the special effects are far superior and most of the cast are passable. However, the major problem I have with it is that it's just a retread of the original plot. Do you mean to tell me that in the years we've had since with TV shows exploring the paranormal that we can't make an entirely new ""Ghostbusters"" without just ripping off the original plot, inserting a few vomit and slime jokes and just completely embarrassing the cast with moronic lines and idiotic scenes. The best part of the first movie is that it was hilarious for being played straight; the humor coming from the characters reacting to each other and the phenomenon. Also, the main cast had a purpose. Murray was the cynic, Aykroyd was the heart, Ramis the brain and Hudson the everyman. Sigourney Weaver was the straight man, and Moranis was the comic foil. In this movie, the cast comes across as someone's dirty little fantasy as they somehow replicate piece by piece the same inventions and create the exact same work uniforms as the first movie. It's almost as if the characters saw the first movie and said, ""Well, let's make one of those that works and dress like them too."" Now, I like Kristen Wiig; she's one of the movie's most likable redeeming features, but Melissa McCarthy is just woefully miscast, ruining every scene she's in. She is just freaking annoying, but then that's what happens when you cast an actress who plays the same character in virtually every movie in which she stars. She really might have worked better in Kate McKinnon's role and vice versa, and then there's the tall Sasquatchy actress, I just can't recall her name, I'll just call her ""Patty,"" but she also seems miscast when she should have been playing one of the demonic entities this movie is passing off as ghosts. The problem is the good jokes are immediately followed by bad jokes, the so-called ghosts look more like ""Scooby Doo"" villains and the so-called villain is tacked on like as afterthought. There is absolutely no follow-up to his appearance, and his so-called apocalypse looks more like just some annoying inconvenience. It's just incredibly boring. The worst part is that Chris Hemsworth is woefully underused and embarrassed by playing an affable idiot that by all rights would be in a special school than holding a job. It would have been funnier if they had treated him like how guys have been treating women for the last fifty years. For an interesting premise, the plot focuses too hard on trying to be funny than staying on plot, the jokes are predictable before they even land and some of them don't even land; maybe if they had stayed on the plot instead of playing up the jokes. The cameos of the original cast are kind of pointless; the one by Ozzy Osbourne is really embarrassing for him. The plot has holes in it that don't make sense. (How does Rowan know he'll become a ghost? He could have gone directly into the afterlife.) For that matter, the paranormal facts in this movie are non-existent – it just seemingly makes stuff up as it goes along. At least the original didn't stray off-field as much as this one does.",Ghostbusters
132,dave-mcclain,"Haters aside, ""Ghostbusters"" is fresh and fun!",8,15 July 2016,"As the prophetess Taylor Swift has taught us: ""Haters gonna hate hate hate hate hate (baby)."" And there was plenty of pre-release hate for the mid-2016 comedy reboot ""Ghostbusters"" (PG-13, 1:56), starting when its all-female cast was announced in early 2015. There seems to be multiple sources of this anti-reboot prejudice. For starters, it gives many Movie Fans pause when they learn that a beloved film from their younger years (such as 1984's ""Ghostbusters"") is being remade. That concern compounds when filmmakers announce major changes coming to the remake (such as changing the gender of the four main characters from male to female). But most of the vitriol seemed focused just on the fact of the core cast being females. That aspect of the backlash calls to mind Tina Fey's constant annoyance at suggestions that women aren't as funny as men (as she explains in her best-selling 2011 comical autobiography ""Bossypants""). Criticism spread even though the cast of 2016's ""Ghostbusters"" includes the very popular Melissa McCarthy and some of the most prominent and most valuable ""Saturday Night Live"" cast members from the previous decade – regardless of gender. The internet trolls would have been well-advised to withhold judgment. This is an excellent remake which stands on its own merits.2016's ""Ghostbusters"" is a remake that is not simply a retread – and pays appropriate homage to the original. This film changes the gender of the main characters and only keeps the basic set-up of the original – but also gets nostalgic with several significant details, fresh cameo appearances by most of the main actors from the 1984 version, some memorable 80s music and Ray Parker Jr.'s iconic theme song.Erin Gilbert (Kristen Wiig) is a professor at Columbia University who has a skeleton in her closet. (But not a ghost. That comes later.) Her reputation and her bid for tenure at Columbia is threatened by a book that she wrote back in college with classmate Abby Yates (Melissa McCarthy). In the book, the two indulge in their mutual interest in the paranormal by making theoretical claims about the existence of ghosts. At this particularly auspicious moment in Erin's career, Abby tries to resurrect sales of their book by making it available on the internet. Erin finds Abby pursuing her paranormal research at a rather unsophisticated educational institution across town and working with brilliant but quirky engineer Jillian Holtzman (Kate McKinnon). Hoping to get Abby to take the book off the internet, Erin agrees to introduce Abby and Holtzman (as everyone calls her) to the owner (Ed Begley Jr.) of an old New York mansion and the mansion's tour guide (Zach Woods) who claims he encountered a malevolent spirit.One thing leads to another (not wanting to give away too much here) and the three women open up a research facility to investigate claims of paranormal activity in the Big Apple. They hire a receptionist named Kevin (Chris Hemsworth), a dimwitted but handsome/buff young man who is the only one dumb enough to apply for the job, but also too dumb to do it properly. When Erin, Abby and Holtzman investigate a ghost sighting in a subway tunnel, they meet friendly/smart/tough Metropolitan Transit Authority worker Patty Tolan (Leslie Jones) who joins ""the club"" and becomes the fourth ghostbuster.With Erin and Abby's academic expertise, Holtzman's ingenuous but dangerous gadgets and Patty's encyclopedic knowledge of the city (and a hearse from her uncle's funeral home becoming the new ""Ecto-1""), the four women uncover and fight against a plot to unleash ghosts of residents from New York's long and diverse history onto the unsuspecting city. But before the Ghostbusters can save the city from becoming one big haunted house, they have to get past a paranormal debunker (Bill Murray), plus a comically self-centered mayor (Andy Garcia) and his equally politically-motivated adviser (Cecily Strong), not to mention a couple clueless Homeland Security agents (Matt Walsh and Michael Kenneth Williams). It's all good. The four women at the center of this movie ain't afraid of no ghosts – or haters.2016's ""Ghostbusters"" is fresh and very enjoyable. The changes work well and the new cast works even better. In my humble opinion, these are the best roles for McCarthy and Wiig since they starred together in 2011's ""Bridesmaids"", while McKinnon and Jones shine in their biggest big-screen roles to date. Hemsworth's character is good for more than a few laughs (although some of them are a little too far on the silly side) and ""Deadpool"" fans will enjoy seeing Karan Soni in several scenes as a barely-competent food delivery man. Director Paul Feig (who also co-wrote with Katie Dippold) gives us just the right blend of the old and the new (with, however, a couple awkward moments mixed in) and makes very good use of the significant advances in visual effects in the over three decades since the original.If the original ""Ghostbusters"" was a great ""guy movie"" (as some see it), then the 2016 version, with its core female cast and their receptionist being played as a hunky dumb blonde male, then this remake/reboot is ""Ghostbusters"" for women. But that's only one way of thinking, because this film is bigger than all that. 2016's ""Ghostbusters"" is a fun, funny movie that updates the 1984 classic for a new generation – and is very entertaining in its own right, not in spite of the cast, but because of them.

133,swilliky,A hilarious and fun paranormal comedy reboot!,7,14 July 2016,"The rebooted paranormal comedy is a great re-imagining of the classic film. The film rides its raucous energy right through to the credits with top-notch comics and stunning special effects. It's ridiculous this film received so much backlash but I think once general audiences see it, it will garner the appropriate praise it deserves. The story is merely backdrop for the hilarious cast to do what they do best enhanced by special effects that actually utilize the 3-D technology. The story is only partly similar to the originals but takes its own course with Erin Gilbert (Kristen Wiig) working for tenure at Columbia University when she is confronted by a scared museum house owner because she once published a book on ghosts. This book brings her to her co- author and old friend Abby Yates (Melissa McCarthy). Abby has proceeded with her ghost- hunting finding a new assistant in Jillian Holtzman (Kate McKinnon). They lose their funding and set up a business to hunt for ghosts. A nefarious plot is afoot and when subway attendant Patty Tolan (Leslie Jones) stumbles upon it, she brings it to the attention of the three physicists.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com",Ghostbusters

135,abisio,Lots more of fun than the original,10,16 July 2016,"If you (like me) consider Bill Murray humor more cynical than funny then stop reading and go to see this very well done re-make that really improves a lot on the original. If you are not still convinced; let me tell you why. The original GHOSTBUSTERS was about 3 misfit nerds, an African American guy and a girl (the love interest). Only the girl and one of guys has a lot to do in the movie; the rest of characters were heavily underwritten (specially the black guy).In this remake; there are three nerds (women), an African American (woman) and a love interest (guy, cute but not smart at all). But this time, screen time is shared, everybody has a few fun time (even the stupid guy) and the African American girl is lots more better written than the blonde one.This is obvious a McCarthy and Wiig movie; however Paul Feig (the director) let the others two shine and the chemistry between the four women works even better than the original.In terms of jokes; there is lot of slapstick; some women/men sexual jokes and even sum digital FX jokes that make the kids laugh. All that is far more than you can tell about the original that if you see it again now; you will find it kind of boring and not that entertaining than this one (I just did before seen this one).Forget the classic; contrary to even my expectations; this one came out quite right",Ghostbusters
136,bob-the-movie-man,"Of Ghosts, Ghoulies and Trolls",8,20 July 2016,"Aside from the curiosity of grown men walking off cliffs in pursuit of imaginary creatures, 2016 might go down in sociological terms as noteworthy for the vitriol meted out on a particular film – namely this all-female reboot of the much loved 1984 Bill Murray/Dan Ackroyd original (which spawned a rather less-loved 1989 sequel). Not only it seems have ghosts and ghoulies been unleashed on the world, but also trolls lots of them. Quite why this is the case, before anyone had even seen the film, is a bit of a mystery to me. Would this have happened if it had been a ""traditional"" male-dominated reboot? I suspect not. In which case the phenomenon is unpleasantly sexist and wrong. Notwithstanding the internet furore, I went into this with low expectations. but was pleasantly surprised. It's not the best film ever made but as a piece of summer confection, it is far better than most.The plot is largely inconsequential, and follows the vague outline of the original 1984 flick: scary opening; Ghostbusters formation; ghouls released by misfit bad guy; big squishy thing (literally); Ghostbusters to the rescue; will they win through? (erm guesses anyone?).In a bit more detail, Erin (Kristen Wiig) is alarmed to see her academic reputation rocked by the appearance on Amazon of a book she ghost-wrote (arf) many years ago with Abby Yates (Melissa McCarthy). Abby and her kooky colleague, engineering whizz-kid Jillian (Kate McKinnon), are quietly beavering away at a dodgy academic institution in a pseudo-scientific study of the supernatural. The three – together with freaked-out subway ticket clerk Patty (Leslie Jones) – get drawn into the supernatural schemes of loner terrorist nut-job Ed Mulgrave (Ed Begley Jnr) as New York goes non-linear on the spookometer.Classifying the film is a bit tricky since it's not strictly a remake; neither is it a complete reboot. One of the charms of the film in fact is its warm and frequent referrals to the original classic, including (largely) amusing cameos from all but two of the main original cast (excluding Harold Ramis, who died in 2014 – and to who the film is dedicated – and Rick Moranis who just said ""no""). A nice example is the selection of the fire station as the Ghostbuster's headquarters: a choice that is then declined due to the astronomical rents in favour of the upstairs floor of a Chinese takeaway! But as well as wallowing in nostalgia, the film is also aware of its 2016 roots, with some topical jokes and an hilariously barbed anti-trolling reference to the internet furore: a Youtube comment ""Ain't no bitches gonna hunt no ghosts."".I have to admit to not being an enormous fan of Melissa McCarthy's shtick (she falls in my 'Rebel Wilson' categorization box), but Kirsten Wiig is excellent and consistently made me laugh: and there is a lot of good laugh-out-loud humour in here, with the script by Katie Dippold and Paul Feig (""Bridesmaids"", ""Spy"" and who also directs) hitting about a 70:30 hit:miss rate. A more acquired taste is Kate McKinnon who takes kooky to a whole new level. I quite liked her: my wife felt her the weakest of the four leads. But the standout comedy performance here was – surprisingly – by Chris ""Thor"" Hemsworth as the 'dumb but can dance' male secretary Kevin (""such a manly name""). He's a scene-stealer, and adds significant entertainment value to the appealing and clip-filled end-titles.But perfect it's not. The start of the film lumbers rather than launches into its stride (not helped by the up-front 'scar-ee' – tour guide Zach Woods – being a wise-guy joke cracker rather than a straight-man library-lady must be turning in her grave); some of the interplay between the lead characters comes across as forced and a tad cringy; the music editing seems curiously inept at times; and some of the special effects bear more comparison to the 80's films than modern day state-of-the-art.But as a park-brain-at-door summer comedy it didn't disappoint: and if my rating is perhaps a star or two over-generous this is just to counter the internet haters.(If you found this review useful, please visit http://bob-the-movie-man.com to see the graphical version and to sign up for future reviews.

138,bryank-04844,Do not call these 'Ghostbusters'.,2,23 January 2017,"Paul Feig certainly has quite the resume. This writer/director/producer has recently made some of the funnier films, including 'Bridesmaids', 'The Heat', 'Spy', and let's not forget the hit TV series 'Freaks and Geeks'. Feig knows comedy and how to cast his roles perfectly. Each one of those films and a TV show are spot on hilarious with charm and heart. This same filmmaker has pretty much done the impossible, which is revamp the iconic 1980's film 'Ghostbusters'. Even before the first trailer for the movie debuted online, there was a sea of online people who trashed the film even before seeing one single frame of the film. It became a whole thing where sexism became one of the issues here.There is a line in the film where the new 'Ghostbusters' (Kristin Wiig, Melissa McCarthy, Leslie Jones, Kate McKinnon) read an online comment about themselves that references the whole female 'Ghostbusters' debate the online community seems to be having. It's a mildly funny reaction to it all, but this topic seems to come up throughout the film and feels redundant. I hate to say it too, but these online haters of the film before the movie came out might have a smile on their face come opening weekend, because this new 'Ghostbusters' just isn't that good. I'm not saying that I agree with the many people online who were boycotting this movie from the start. I'm quite the opposite in fact. I was for this movie from its inception and announcement, as I love Paul Feig and the incredibly talented cast here. They work well as a team and are quite funny with each other.The unfortunate thing here, is that their chemistry starts and ends quickly with this 'Ghostbusters' storyline, which transfers to a mostly unfunny and jumbled mess of a film. What really makes this film not succeed is that it just moves from scene to scene with an unfunny piece of dialogue here and there and some form of physical comedy that we've seen many times before, but this time it's with a proton pack. There are no thrills or scares in the film either, other than a couple of places where the music crescendos loudly and it startles you. The encounters with the paranormal ghosts are mindless and unoriginal as well, leaving the magic and mystery of it all flat on the floor.Even the characters themselves aren't that distinguishable from each other with the exception of Kate McKinnon, who plays an over-the-top scientist with huge glasses and a ton of goofy faces. It's very cartoony in the worst way. The rest of the characters may have just been one mind in three different bodies, all of them relaying the same thoughts and actions. The relationships between these four women just seem awkward, which is strange because one of the main themes here is friendship, but again, it all falls flat or comes across as super cheesy. What worked so well with the silliness of the original films is that the chemistry between the four Ghostbusters were organic and natural, and seemed like you wanted to be a part of their lives.That is not the case here. Each person just seems to be an over-the-top cartoon version of themselves. Even the villain in this movie is lousy and plays more like a character from a Looney Toons episode than anything of substance. Then there is the fact that the film takes entirely too much time winking and paying homage to the original films with tons of cameos, locations, props, and other lines of dialogue, that it completely takes you out of the entire movie. At least Rick Moranis said, ""No"" to this movie. The visual effects too were a bore with each ghost looking exactly the same as the last one with no real emotion or thrills to them. It was as if the ghosts were unfinished in the editing room and they ran out of time. Then there is the music and the score of the movie, which is just sad and pitiful on all levels.The new Ghostbusters song is horrendous and the score is unpleasant with zero fun and amusement to it. This all being said, there are some decent things about the film, well at least someone tried to do some decent things here. There are several moments where you can see the blue prints of an awesome movie come to be, but with each time good moment, it quickly falls flat and leaves an unsavory taste in your mouth. I mean, Feig cast Chris Hemsworth in the film as the 'Ghostbusters' new secretary, where he plays someone that would never exist on this planet. Sure for the first couple of minutes, his gimmick is comical, but it quickly loses all steam and just becomes annoying. I love Hemsworth, and I'm sure he had fun in this role, but it adds nothing to the film or the franchise.There is the potential for a good movie hidden in here somewhere, but even the amazing cast here couldn't save it from itself. Again, there are cameos galore in the film and be sure to stay till after the credits roll, but I won't be calling these 'Ghostbusters' again any time soon.YOU KNOW YOU'RE GONNA SEE IT!",Ghostbusters

140,Carycomic,"""Who ya gonna call?"" Ray Parker.",5,16 July 2016,"I first saw the original film back when my hometown multiplex had only four theaters (rather than the present half-dozen). Since then, it's undergone about three or four different changes in ownership. And an upgrade in technology.But, if this movie was supposed to be an upgrade to the original and its only sequel, it failed.Don't get me wrong! I loved the Hitchcockian cameos by most of the original cast members. Plus, the bronze statue commemorating the too- soon-taken Harold Ramis. But, Bill Murray, as Dr. Heiss, was nowhere near as lovable to hate as William Atherton's Walter Peck of the EPA. And, the sadly absent Rick Moranis should've played Dean Tom Shanks rather than Stephen Higgins (whom I've never heard of before). Then, there are the stars of this remake. As with Higgins, I've also never heard of Kristen Wiig. That goes double for the even more forgettable actress who played Jillian Holtzmann. Melissa McCarthy is definitely funnier on TV than in feature films. And the only reason Leslie Jones, as Patty, steals the show from her fellow females is because the other three don't have enough collective chemistry to balance her literally overpowering acting! I refuse to even discuss the hip-hop remake of the original theme song.One of this film's few saving graces is the production number seen in the ending credits. Sort of a combination of the Zombie Hustle, from Michael Jackson's ""Thriller,"" and the Jim Carrey rendition of ""Cuban Pete"" from THE MASK! Chris Hemsworth's dancing in that is funnier than all the intended jokes in the film's dialogue (especially the ones spouted by the racist eco-activist tour guide at the beginning of the film).In short?

142,DarthVoorhees,Funny and original.,7,20 July 2016,'Ghostbusters' isn't worth all the controversy. It's a harmless and all and all a pretty decent matinée summer movie. It isn't perfect by any stretch of the imagination as it has problems that tend to plague remakes of iconic films but conceptually it takes a lot more chances than a lot of remakes do. I enjoyed it a lot.The main problem with 'Ghostbusters' is that there are times when Paul Feig just doesn't succeed in his homages. The film has some very annoying things in it's attempts to have fun with the 'Ghostbusters' iconography. For starters there isn't a single good remix of the original theme song and we get a lot of remixes. I get that the song is so classic but it's used in silly ways that sort of lose the intended nostalgic effect. Feig should have Saved the song and used it as originally performed in the grand finale. Also I can't get over Slimer's girlfriend. She is pretty grotesque. The good news is that this is a very funny film. As far as remakes go 'Ghostbusters' is one of the most original. That is the main take away here. This film has it's own distinct personality and world. It's tone is noticeably completely different from the original film. It doesn't have that dry sense of humor as it goes for very big and outlandish characters and set pieces. It also has a great deal more physical humor. And so the biggest so called complaint about it ruining the original film is pretty much completely null and void as this is a completely different approach to the same set up.I feel as if I cannot review the film without mentioning one my take on the controversy behind it. And so the one missed opportunity is even the writers couldn't be aware of the horrible people that were going to whine about it. The main villain of the movie is a socially awkward nerd trying to use ghosts as a means of revenge for being a socially awkward nerd. It's a real shame they didn't have the foresight to make him a caricature of the ‪#‎Gamergate‬/MRA crowd that thinks this movie is the end of the world. It would have given the movie more of an edge and made those losers even more furious),Ghostbusters
143,Imdbidia,"Pleasant enough, but below expectations",5,6 March 2017,"I watched the original movies when I was younger and really enjoyed them, so I was looking forward to watching this, as I usually find the ladies in the film very funny.On the good side, the film production is excellent, it has great special effects and the film looks polished. I also loved seeing the cameos of the old original leading cast. The acting was good and believable taking into account the material the actors were given. I loved having a bimbo secretary man who is basically hot and dumb; that was one of the funniest things in the film, together with the closing credits dance.On the bad side, if you decide to use somebody else's shoes, you better have the same size! Well, the shoes were quite big for them! When the original Ghostbusters came out, the film was an instant hit because it was original, it was witty, and it had wow special effects for the time. This being a remake, the originality wasn't there and, therefore, the script was predictable. No problem with that if the viewer had been given funny and exciting dialogues and scenes. This is supposed to be a comedy, but no laughs came out from me; except from very few cases, I don't consider this a comedy, is more a light adventure film than anything else. While watching the film, I found myself uninterested, checking my watch a couple of times, and slightly bored. This could have been hilarious, but it was just OK.",Ghostbusters
144,RussHog,Pure garbage - one of the worst movies ever made!,1,11 October 2016,"When I read that women were being insulted because of this film - I was angry and I wanted to set the record straight. I attended this film to support this franchise.When it started - I quickly realized this was the same studio that did the awful Spider Man movies and the awful TMNT movies - and this train wreck is just as bad - if not worse.It basically is about four people who for no good reason suddenly fight ghosts - but there are no relationships to care about - and it's just very, very annoying. It seems obvious there is no script - they just point the camera and try to act funny. But nothing is funny - the whole film just sucks. It sucks so bad. I later read and saw evidence that Sony doctored the negative reviews as a ploy to get people angry to raise hype for the film - and I am glad that their cynical plan backfired.Do anything else but watch this film - it is a disgrace.",Ghostbusters
145,CANpatbuck3664,"I'm Not Being Sexist, I Honestly Just Wish They Had Left Ghostbusters Alone",5,21 July 2016,"The amount of hatred around this movie from both sides of the aisle is just insane. Anyone who likes it is a fanatical feminist or a social justice warrior and anyone who hates it is a backward misogynistic man-child. Going into this movie, I'm going to admit that I wasn't completely unbiased for two reasons. First of all, the marketing for this movie was really bad, those trailers were pretty unappealing. Two, I never had a problem with the new Ghostbusters being women but I'm tired of Hollywood remaking classic movies and the remake having little to no understanding about what made the original special. But I saw the reviews were good so I decided to check it out. While I'm admitting that I didn't like Ghostbusters, I want to reiterate that if I thought this movie was good, I would admit my change of heart and say so. Unfortunately that's not the case.*Minor Spoilers Ahead* The movie starts at the Aldridge mansion in New York City. Garrett (Zach Woods) is leading a tour group through the mansion and tells them of how the daughter of the owner of the house murdered the servants and was locked in the basement by her father. A candlestick falls over near the door to the basement which creeps the group out. Later we learn its just a show put on by Garrett. He's just about to leave at closing time when he hears noises, the doorknob on the basement door rattles and things begin to levitate. He retreats into the basement but the floor starts to break apart with green ooze coming out. He tries to vacate the basement and the title card flashes as a ghost rises from the floor and Garrett begins to scream.I'll start out with what I liked about the movie. The studio obviously had a lot of faith in this movie because it carried over a $100 million budget and it shows. The CGI and the visual effects were pretty top notch. The ghosts and the paranormal look great and although the execution is mixed, I was impressed. Although I though some of the acting was weak, I thought there were some bright spots too. Chris Hemsworth stole the movie, he actually has some pretty good comic timing and maybe this movie will lead to some more comedic roles (Channing Tatum style with his breakout in 21 Jump Street). I also thought Kate McKinnon and Leslie Jones were funny in certain scenes. They weren't consistent but they each had their moments.The biggest reason that I didn't like this movie was that I just didn't find it funny. Most of the jokes fell really flat and there were some really awkward parts where I just wished the movie would move on. The original movie is a classic not only because of how many good jokes it had however but also because the main cast had some really great chemistry together. I just didn't feel that here either. Wiig and McCarthy worked the best together (they've worked together before) but again in that aspect, it just paled in comparison to the original.Getting to the acting, it was largely mixed. I was shocked at how unfunny I found Kristen Wiig to be here. She's been really great in other stuff but she's super awkward here (that's also her character but it didn't make me laugh). McCarthy was pretty restrained, which was a good thing but again, I didn't find her funny. She usually works really well with Paul Feig (check out Spy it's really good) but it didn't click for me. McKinnon and Jones were intermittently good, they definitely were throwing the most into it and I appreciate that. Hemsworth was solid but the villain Neil Casey was really annoying both as a character and the actor. Some of the cameos were good (I liked Sigourney Weaver, Ernie Hudson and Annie Potts) but others seemed forced. It's good that the Ghostbusters reboot had the support of the original cast but the cameos seemed more like fan service than actually serving the movie.Watching this movie just made me sad. I wanted to like it, I really did. I watched it with two good friends and we all left the theatre saying pretty much the same thing. The visuals were solid and I did laugh a little but this isn't essential viewing by any means. I just wish that they had let this franchise be, I didn't even feel this movie worked particularly well on its own even putting aside the original two. If people genuinely enjoy this, I'm not going to ridicule them for it. Honestly, good for them. It just didn't work for me and I feel like people are being too kind to this movie in certain respects just because of the large amount of heat being generated by it now.",Ghostbusters
146,Delrvich,Better than the originals,7,18 June 2021,"Not a fan of light-hearted comedy or deadpan in movies if there is a crisis (eg ghosts, alien invasion like Independence Day, etc ...) and I ranked the originals at barely 6 stars.

But the story itself struggled at points, the homages/cameos felt forced and the franchise-y-ness was a bit much. Basically, I would have rather seen Feig direct this cast in an original story rather than a paint by numbers affair. I still laughed - because how could you not with these stars? - but I would take this director's other efforts over this in a heartbeat.",Ghostbusters
148,SquigglyCrunch,"The Movie Never Surpasses Being Generic, but it Goes Lower Too Often",1,1 May 2017,"Ghostbusters is a remake of the classic movie of the same name, and it follows a group of scientists who believe that ghosts exist and set out to stop them from taking over the world/Manhattan. I can think of few saving graces for this film. One of them is the fact that the humor did land on occasion. Specifically the humor around Chris Hemsworth's character tended to be, while dumb, entertaining.The other of which was Kate McKinnon. Of all the performances in the movie, it was clear that she was having the most fun, and as a result made the movie at least slightly more bearable. I get the feeling she read the script, realized how bad it was, then thought of the paycheque and rolled with it. While all the other actors seemed to be taking their roles way too seriously, McKinnon just seemed to be having a good time. As far as flaws, Ghostbusters has far too many. While McKinnon is good, her counterparts are awful. Like I said, they all take their roles way too seriously, and even then they can't pull off good serious performances. And again, while some of the humor was good, most of it was just plain bad. I saw the attempts and sighed at how generically horrid they were. Every joke you expected to be pulled was (yes, including fart jokes). In addition to bad acting, the characters were just dull and uninteresting. They were built around stereotypes and barely fleshed out. Wasn't this movie given a full-female cast because of the sake of progression/feminism? Then why is it that the black lady is the street smart one? That's a stereotype, I thought we were trying to get past that. The writing makes the movie out to be heartfelt and investing, but it simply isn't. By the end it acts like the audience has really gotten to know and love the characters, when in reality the amount of development given to them was so little that it makes me wonder if the writers even tried, or looked through the script again to make sure everything made sense. And it wasn't just the regular amount of generic 'heartfelt' stuff, the movie kind of overdid it to the point where it was just tedious. Probably the worst part of this movie though was the climax. It was so ridiculous, and it came out of nowhere. For a movie sporting a 116 minute run time, you'd think that the plot would be well-fleshed out and developed, but it's far from that. The ghostbusters themselves catch maybe 2 ghosts before the climax starts. And even then, they primarily go after the small ghosts. I don't know what could've been going through the characters heads. There are giant ghosts everywhere, why are they going for the little ones stealing food from hot dog stands? And then there's this big battle royal at the end that goes on far too long, makes far too little sense, and is far too ridiculous. Then we're bombarded by generically bad heartfelt scenes that are supposed to create tension but fail to. If there was a breaking point for me anywhere in this movie, it would've been as soon as the climax started. And to top it off, the ghosts themselves are flawed. They all seem to have inconsistent abilities, from passing through walls and car doors to being able to sit down in the car physically and drive it. If they can't interact with things, how do they drive? This is just one example, but it really doesn't make any sense throughout the rest of the movie. Overall Ghostbusters is just awful. It refuses to reach above its genericism, yet pretends to do just that. It's not all that boring really, but there are just so many bad things about it that those flaws just stack up, ultimately making this just a terrible movie. I'll leave it at that. In the end I wouldn't recommend it.",Ghostbusters
149,auuwws,Ghostbusters,1,15 December 2020,"One of the worst films I have seen in my life, CGI. The movie is worse than the old movie. The characters are very bad. The movie is a comedy failure.

150,beresfordjd,I was not surprised,3,24 July 2016,"I did not expect to like this film much and I was , therefore , not surprised how much I disliked it. To be honest the original Ghostbusters movie was only OK, mainly saved by Bill Murray. There is no Bill Murray here. Neither Kristen Wiig nor Melissa McCarthy is a big enough talent to compete with Murray in the comedy stakes. It merely shows a lack of imagination and creativity in the film business these days if this is the best they can come up with. Special effects were fine but could not save the movie. It is boring, unfunny and lame in the extreme. I just knew that it would be poor as I hated Bridesmaids too even though I looked forward to seeing it- I had no experience of Wiig's so-called talent and am still waiting to see some sign of it. Melissa McCarthy seems a little more likable but fart jokes just do not do it for me. Ghostbusters 2016 is beyond boring for me - I don't think I smiled once, let alone laughed. As it is supposed to be a comedy that immediately is a severe problem.",Ghostbusters
151,cultfilmfreaksdotcom,They Don't Ruin It Like This Anymore,4,15 July 2016,"When word hit the streets Bill Murray would provide a cameo, the anticipated GHOSTBUSTERS reboot was rumored to be a sequel – nothing doing. Bill, the sarcastic cool dude who grounds the original, plays another version of ""Dickless"" here... True fans will get that reference and for newcomers, he's a complete jerk – but not the villain, by any means...That title should go to the writers, Katie Dippold and Paul Feig. And yet as director, Feig provides some scary, suspenseful moments, almost as if he really, deep down, wanted to make a bonafide horror flick with a side-plate of comedy. And there are times when the four girl Ghostbusters geek-out with a genuine flow of scientific expository dialogue, especially Melissa McCarthy as Abby, a hybrid of Dan Aykroyd's soulful buried-lead and a cerebral Harold Ramis... Meanwhile, Kristin Wiig has the most to lose, at first, working at the same University where the original Ghostbusters were expelled. Uptight and anxious, she must adhere to the subtle goading of tomboy Kate McKinnon as Jillian, the token wild card who acts as if we know her character already. In fact, in many ways, Feig's GHOSTBUSTERS seems more like a dull sequel to a first (proverbial) venture that, like SPY and BRIDESMAIDS, actually worked...But they really don't have much at risk (like Aykroyd's Ray, who took a Second Mortgage on his parent's house to get the ball rolling) and way too much time's spent with characters trying to be witty – who just aren't. This includes our main trio, so comfortable with each other they don't have to work in order to gel and/or smooth out any rough edges, and side-characters like THOR sex symbol Chris Hemsworth as the perfect looking yet vapid secretary along with Leslie Jones's Patty. While he reminds everyone ""I'm great looking and don't act as such,"" she's a sassy expert on the history of New York City to aid the science-minded former- bullied Wiig and McCarthy, and yet their camaraderie leads to nowhere. And the foursome's rags to riches climb to be taken seriously – from finding a logo to perfecting weapons to landing their first gig hired by an uptight building manager – mirrors the Ivan Reitman directed comedy classic like THE FORCE AWAKENS did to STAR WARS: stalking the premise in an accidental yet intentionally contrived fashion (although not quite as much; and there's an evil ghost frying from an electric chair current, liken to the 1989 sequel).The jokes, either in an overboard Judd Apatow style or your typical ""polar opposite buddy banter,"" falls flat on top of a story that's almost intriguing, and hell, even somewhat original, leading to an overlong finale which, as you'd expect, seems downright blasphemous – then again, maybe it all is, or... was. Because it doesn't matter if bundles are made on the opening weekend; this reboot probably won't have legs – most of us remember the horribly flawed GHOSTBUSTERS II. In the case of the entire franchise, with an overall theme so outrageous and far-fetched, it's really something that needs to be perfected upon the first attempt, which 1984 was and 2016 ain't.",Ghostbusters
152,PyroSikTh,"It's a Team of Women, So What?",7,20 July 2016,"This new vision follows the broad strokes of the original fairly closely. Three scientists are struggling at their respective establishments of higher education due to a lack of faith in them from their superiors (or a lack of knowledge of their existence). Given the opportunity to hunt ghosts, two of the scientists drag their reluctant accomplice along (converting her) and they start up the Ghostbusters to tackle to sudden resurgence of ghostly activity around New York City.Of course there are a number of changes. The most obvious of which is the complete gender- swap. The four male ghostbusters of the original are now female, and the receptionist is now male. Furthermore, Kevin is thick as s**t and completely naive to everything. The specifics are also changed a lot, for example the big bad is a depressed recluse who wants to take over the city with an army of undead.Like many in the recent wave of nostalgia movies, Ghostbusters does all it can to re-ignite that nostalgia and reference the original movies as much as possible. Most obvious is in the various cameos of the original cast. Bill Murray plays Martin Heiss, a ghost debunker, Dan Aykroyd plays a know-it-all taxi driver, Ernie Hudson plays Patty's uncle, Sigourney Weaver makes a brief appearance as Holtzman's mentor, and even Annie Potts appears as a hotel desk clerk. Slimer also makes an appearance, as well as the marshmallow man, and some lines are lifted from the original and re-used (Aykroyd drives off yelling ""I ain't afraid of no ghosts"").The jokes this time around are of a much more modern nature, obviously. They range from toilet humour and gross-outs to hilarious little character moments. Hemsworth is a particular stand- out in this regard as he plays the dimwitted Kevin completely straight-faced, without exemplifying the character's stupidity too much, but Leslie Jones is also particularly enjoyable on the comedy side of things as well. In fact my favourite moment was when she's walking around backstage at the metal concert talking to herself, she peers into a room full of mannequins and simply says ""Well that's a room full of nightmares"" and briskly walks off. There's also a couple of self-aware nods to it's franchise and the controversy it's caused as well. I wouldn't call Ghostbusters a hilarious movie, but I won't deny that I chuckled a few times. I think my mum was nearly in tears of laughter at one moment though (yes, I take my mum to the cinema, so what?), and there was a woman in the front row who seemed to be having a whale of a time cackling almost every five minutes.The visual effects are generally very good. While the effects are deliberately made rather cartoony, they can be quite scary. The first encounter with a ghost is actually really spooky and, being so early and not knowing how ghosts would be treated this time around, I found myself watching it through my peripherals just in case something jumped out. Despite their cartoony nature (each one is in a glowing blue aura that makes them obvious and stick out), they can be quite disturbing as well. For example one prominent ghost is a death row inmate who was electrocuted, so he's complete with electrocution headgear and a somewhat fried appearance. There's also a surprising amount of detail as well, particularly in regards to the final ghost they have to defeat, which is an oversized, evil-looking version of the Ghostbusters logo, but he's designed with a clothy texture that looks rough and creased.Acting is pretty good across the board. It won't win any awards, and being a comedy there isn't exactly a whole load of opportunities for the actors to dig their teeth into, but there wasn't really any bad performances either. Kristen Wiig plays her typecast as the geeky middle-aged woman as Erin Gilbert, while Melissa McCarthy takes on a much more subdued role to what she usually plays. Leslie Jones plays the more typical McCarthy character, but being a black woman, it just comes off as a little stereotypical. Kate McKinnon may be considered the weak link of the core four characters as she never particularly appears to be in the moment. I get that Holtzman is meant to be a little mentally unhinged, but McKinnon didn't really bring that idea across and instead just looks like an actress reading her lines. Chris Hemsworth shows his comedic muscles brilliantly, but I've already mentioned his smart approach to the dimwitted character. And of course all the cameos are great.In all, I can't say that I didn't enjoy Ghostbusters. It had it's funny moments, it rekindled nostalgia really well, and it's visual effects are certainly well done. As for the gender-swap twist, I didn't really notice it. Ghostbusters was never defined by the fact it's four leads were male, and so the uproar over them all being female this time around I find completely dumbfounding. It really doesn't matter, at all, not in the slightest. It has no impact on the story at all (apart from a single queef joke). With this slant, it could be argued that the feminist angle is strong, and I guess in a way it is, as almost all the men are either evil or stupid, but short of making the ghostbusters team a bit more equal in it's make-up, or just making it comprised entirely of women, I'm not sure how that could be avoided. In all I give the new Ghostbusters and enjoyable, but not groundbreaking 7/10. Just like I said with Dawn of Justice, screw the haters, go see it and judge for yourself.",Ghostbusters
153,ebeckstr-1,Not particularly funny,3,30 June 2019,"I should qualify this review by first saying that I think the first Ghostbusters, while amusing, is overrated. Despite having seen it a number of times I've never quite understood it's status as a great comedy. Maybe that disqualifies me from reviewing this version of Ghostbusters since I don't really appreciate the franchise as a whole. In any case, aside from three or four reasonably decent laughs generated by Kristen Wiig and Chris Hemsworth, this version is painfully unfunny. This means that even its homages to the original Ghostbusters fall flat because they occur within a decidedly not very good movie. And now we have word that there is yet another reboot planned - a direct sequel to the original. Good luck with that.",Ghostbusters

155,blackmamba99971,For your consideration,7,22 July 2016,"Although the early years of the ghost busters had some steam in both dialogue, and action this remake did a pretty good job at delivering some funny lines. Using some of the locations from the first film was a good idea to at least give some of the fans an idea where it all started. Yet the scenes could have been done a little better during some of the fight sequences. A person can tell what is a green screen, and what is real. The plot needed some serious work too. Why was rowan evil? What drove him to become the next messiah of the apocalypse?, and why use a four hundred foot tall mock up of their logo? It all seemed too rushed in the making of the movie to allow some satisfaction to be delivered. However it was a good idea to let those bumbling fools such as Bill Murray, Sigourney Weaver, or even slimmer to show their faces for a last time to give the movie more juice. I can say though that the humour was great. Lots of particular strangeness to the characters especially with Kate mcinnon. I'm not much into slapstick comedy but she did give off a nice shine to every punch line she spoke with added body language. All in all, this remake is a good summer filler. I just wished that the evil character could have been better. Including the dreaded device used to bring about the end of the world. It needed more depth, possibly more ancient lore to make the story more believable. Using the ley lines however was nice touch. If only additional legends worked in the mix the plot would have been cemented better. I can give this seven stars out of ten. Kids will love it.",Ghostbusters

Well, my opinion of the movie wasn't one to go along with the sexist drivel this film was receiving. There were many comments in protest to the female leads who do a fine job in this movie. Especially considering what they have to work with. Sadly not very much. My protest was more of a ""why?"" Why do we need a reboot? Surely seeing the original cast reunite would have been worth the ticket price alone? I am getting tired of seeing fond childhood memories of 80's,90's classics sullied just so Hollywood can milk a few more million dollars. Total Recall, Robocop, anyone? I remember as an eight year old boy going to see the original Ghostbusters and being both amazed and frightened by the movie magic on screen And that's what's missing here, magic! This 2016 version is not all bad but in comparison to the original it's just a little bland. Fine if you are too young to have been around in 1984. This update as you'd expect has CGI polish sprayed all over the screen but none of it seems to be buffed up. Colourful visuals never amaze or excite. There are no jump scares, no nail biters. Everything is a little cartoonish. Maybe it's because I'm not eight years old anymore? There's a good comedic turn from Chris Hemsworth but other than that I'm really struggling to write a review here. This film is instantly forgettable. Even the strategically placed cameos fail to make an impression. They seem to be spaced throughout the movie so we don't get up and leave. There's even one in the end credits. For me this was a throw away movie. It passed a few hours more pleasurably than say 'watching paint dry?' I subconsciously waited until the movie came on TV before watching it.

That's probably half due to the campy concept though, and the film with its solid main quartet does well at matching it with a goofy-fun vibe throughout that's enjoyable even when the jokes don't land (Jillian's lip-syncing and Kevin's interview are bits that definitely do though-I lol'd).",Ghostbusters

160,p-jonsson,What a disappointment!,1,30 December 2016,"This movie was a huge disappointment! The only positive thing I can say about it is that the special effects where not half bad. The movie itself was childish, unfunny, unintelligent and generally really bad.Some reviews giving this movie 9 or 10 stars (which is just ludicrous) are saying that people cannot handle the feminism in the movie. What feminism? Replacing the original actors with women is not feminism as far as I am concerned and anyway, if you care about such things should it not have been two women and two men to be politically correct? Also, the supposedly intelligent women in this movie behave in a typical old-fashioned Hollywood stereotype of women way. They are mostly downright silly. If I were a feminist I would actually have been insulted by this movie.Then we have the male clerk that is dummer than a piece of rock. If someone had stacked four supposedly intelligent men and a single blond bimbo that is totally devoid of any trace of intelligence together in a movie the social justice warriors would have cried foul so loud that you could hear it across the planet. But since it is four women and a stupid male it is okay (not really). It is even feminism according to some people. What a load of b....There is actually a story in the movie although it is well hidden under the silly jokes and silly behavior. It is paper thin and rather silly in itself but it could have worked if the rest of the movie was up to snuff but sadly it is not.As I wrote above the only good thing about this movie is the special effects. The few scenes that I actually enjoyed was during the big shoot out at the end which had some cool moments.

161,James_De_Bello,6/10,6,13 August 2016,"Dr. Erin Gilbert (Kristen Wiig) doesn't believe in the existence of paranormal anymore, even though she wrote a guide to it in the past with her ex-colleague Abby Yates (Melissa McCarthy). Yet, when she witnesses a full fledged stage 4 apparition her beliefs are changed once more and with the help of Yates, Holtzmann (Kate McKinnon) and Patty Tolan (Leslie Jones), founds a team to fight ghosts who are rampaging through the city.Paul Feig is a comedy master. He is the mind behind ""Freaks and Geeks"", ""Bridesmaids"" and ""Spy"" which makes him an instant check out for me. The way he weaves comedy through character is something not many directors in his camp have achieved to his effect, so of course when you go out to check his new film there are always high expectations no matter what. ""Ghostbusters"", whilst far from being any kind of disaster, has a good sense of humor that does not quite translate into the flow of endless laughter it thinks it is, nor the kind of which we are used to with Feig.I am going to say right up front that I am no kind of big ""Ghostbuster"" (1984) enthusiast. I saw the film once, liked it and for me it ended there. All I wanted from this new iteration was a good film with laughs, I couldn't care less of anything surrounding that. Fortunately, that is exactly where the film is good. It just another comedy film and that is what its trying to be. Whereas it may fall apart in its plot and third act, the cast is killer and the laughs which are present are really good.For me the couple that made the film was Chirs Hemsowrth and Kate McKinnon. No sh*t they just had to be on screen for my attention to be sparked and for me to start laughing. That is definitely due to the fact that they both have two amazing, scene stealing characters to work with. They made me laugh so hard because they were written so brilliantly. This is really Feig's tact for comedy coming alive in the best way. There gags were hilarious, they just had to say a word or make a move and it made sense to laugh for me, that is really remarkable.Not that their costars aren't doing a good job too, they actually all have their moments, yet being written slightly thinner they didn't emerge or stay with me as much as the best two. And that is where a lot of the film fell apart for me. It simply resulted way too forgettable. The third act had no impact on me, I wasn't feeling anything, it just came to be this by the numbers resolution that had no character to it. What up to that point was a quite entertaining comedy with only little flaws, became a huge on screen mess of which I can hardly remember anything.This was certainly for Feig a very, very hard task and it turned out to be a bad day at the office, and for a movie like this to come out of that is saying something about him: he doesn't deliver what we might expect, but sparks of his brilliance still manage to make it through a produce what is a more than decent comedy effort.",Ghostbusters
162,scottshak_111,Funny at times but falls flat big time.,6,31 August 2016,"A tribute to the original. Anything about Ghostbusters and it takes us back in time. The Ivan Reitman project was hands down colossal. You watch it even in this era and it still manages to leave its impression on you. Paul Feig's Ghostbusters comes nowhere close to bringing that old anxious charm of the original. It is funny alright, but there is nothing that could bring it close let alone surpass the levels of Reitman's work.DIRECTION AND PLOT OF GHOSTBUSTERS Ghostbusters skims on the surface of the original, so there is nothing extraordinary that the movie has to offer, except for glimpses, characters and ghosts from the past that fill you up with nostalgia. There are plenty of elements from the 1984 gang strewn all across the movie. You might go, ""Ah! There he is!"" or ""Oooh! Oooh! That's from the old one!"" Clinging to the original fun theme of the movie, that neither goes too dark or stays too aloof from it, Ghostbusters manages to walk well on what it was proposed to canter on. However, there isn't an element of surprise lurking anywhere here. The world Paul Feig creates is unaffected by ghosts, the multitude of dumbness, who stay unfazed by the lives of any ghostbuster, unaware of what's going on. They seem to come in as they please, react when it seems fit to them.Feig's direction goes to awkward enclaves when he constantly keeps chopping off frames quickly moving on from one scene to another without caring enough for the audience to take it in. You can witness the shoddy editing go strangely awry at so many points that it creates a portal of disconnect.GOOD BITS TO CHERISH Chris Hemsworth as Kevin is probably the funniest thing in Ghostbusters. The only notable and memorable element that you might want to talk about in the long run, owing to the levels of dumbness he is shown scaling. Kristen Wiig's Erin Gilbert has an instant apparent crush on him and she aces it with her superb comic timing.Kate McKinnon builds up a strange character Jillian Holtzmann which is oddly satisfying. She does most of the work for the team. She has this eccentric cool style that will make you love her instantly.CAMEOS AND GLIMPSES FROM THE PAST (SPOILERS OBVIOUSLY DU-UH!) There are plenty of cameos to watch out for. First of all, all those major characters from the 1984 movie pop up every now and then at odd hours namely: Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd and Ernie Hudson. Not to forget Annie Potts who reprises her role as the desk receptionist here as well. Ozzy Osbourne shows up at one point too which was a pleasant surprise. Slimer the green ghost gets to drive the Ecto 1. It was good to see him revived after so long.The ugly part of it all was that their inclusion seemed oddly forced. There was no subtlety to it. No jokes flew when they were there and that makes it look utterly fabricated. Camera zooms in at a lot of places to deliberately show a past reference. Easter Eggs are like lying in front of the camera for 2 minutes for you to notice.FINAL VERDICT If you divide the movie in subsections, you will realize that the movie does fairly well in the first half. In the later half Ghostbusters' humour simply drops dead. If you focus on how it manages to bring back every character from the past, you will have nothing less than goosebumps on your body. Humour comes naturally with the inclusion of Melissa McCarthy and Kristen Wiig. But if you look at it as a complete movie, sadly it fails to dilate your eyes.Read all my reviews here: http://straightfromamovie.com",Ghostbusters
163,colewaters,Ghostbusters reboot is a triumph,10,17 July 2016,"This movie is the best movie of the year so far. Ghostbusters was funny, scary and super cool all at the same time. In my option this was much better then the original Ghostbusters movie. Chris Hemsworth was flat out hilarious the whole way through and so was the rest of the cast. This movie will make everyone in your family love Ghostbusters again and the 3D was fantastic. I never saw 3D like that before best 3D ever good job Ghostbusters and I'm not afraid of no ghost. This was the coolest film of the year.Parents this movie maybe a little scary for your little ones but if you think they can handle it go ahead and take them they will love it one great movie that will be a hit forever and ever and ever. Ghost busters (2016) was truly a masterpiece on a large scale and it turned out terrific I love it.WHO YOU GONNA CALL GHODTBUSTERS",Ghostbusters
164,tankace,Sometimes the original shouldn't be touched!,5,12 March 2017,"The new Ghostbusters isn't as awful as other films but it was definitely disappointing of it had zero charm, the effects were badly made to say the list and the comedy in it was poop-jokes that even the Jackass crew would find to immature.The main reason why I didn't review it sooner was to re watch it and let my personal thoughts shank in and not be affected by the war between those who said that it is a dis-grace to the memory of the original, the persons who said that the first-ones are misogynists and the usual trouble-makers who joint either side just to cause more chaos for their amusement. So not wanting to get tangled in to that mess I took my time and this is my personal point of view.Firstly the actresses in the film are quit good comedians when they have the proper material and here sadly it isn't the case. An other issue that I have is that almost all the male characters are total A-holes to our protagonists. OK I get to have some of them be like that ,but everyone(?) that is genuinely offensive to the other half of our specie. This when you think ,no matter the gender it is wrong to show in such as way our society.Secondary as previous mentioned the effects aren't even on par with the 1987 film, really you had tens of millions in your disposal and this is your best? As for the jokes are seldomly good and usually I felt that were written by people who lack any idea what is comedy. As for the little horror elements are OK at times and forgettable in the rest of the flick.Thirdly the theme song was awful. For real I have no clue why they choose that piece a garbage. It tries to be like the original ,but in the modern times. Here an idea WHY NOT use a theme which is made for you and you can use it!?!Over all it is times like that, when you think that Hollywood has run out of originality and you get nostalgia. To be honest after reaching a little I saw that after the first film most of the main members and directorial team didn't wanted to come back so can it be a surprise that a film which was never to be made was below our expectations",Ghostbusters
165,jawneyfloros,great by a feminist perspective,1,19 November 2018,Review: I was disappointed with this movie because I expected a lot more from a ghostbusters reboot. The direction and screenplay are disappointing. Both the casting and acting are disappointing also. All in all I would give this one out of a possible five stars.,Ghostbusters
166,gregberne11,Terrible Reboot,2,5 February 2020,"The opening scene was quite good and my hopes were high. I like Wiig, McCarthy and the rest of the cast in other things but nothing seems to work in this film. The jokes were tedious and fell flat. The CGI was decent but as always not nearly as good as practical effects and seemed overly cartoonish. The action was also cartoonish. They just needed a much better story, and better writing overall. It's hard to live up to expectations with something like Ghostbusters but this movie just fell completely flat. Even the cameos by the original cast fell flat. Ernie Hudson's was decent but lasted only a few seconds. Aykroyd, Weaver and Potts had nothing funny or good to work with. Murray seemed like he was just reading his lines in order to fulfill his contractual obligations as quickly as possible, straight manning his way through a part that turned out to be completely useless. I sincerely hope they don't try to do a sequel to this. The guy receptionist was such a desperate attempt to be funny, and so not funny. The subway worker was the best character of the four Ghostbusters and I can't even remember the actor or character's name, and that tells you everything you need to know about this useless and unnecessary movie.",Ghostbusters
167,Tak005,Don't mess with a classic,6,28 July 2018,Obviously this is a remake of the original Ghostbusters. Ostensibly it is the same story as the original but with gender roles reversed. There is really nothing wrong with the acting but it lacks the originals sharp wit. It does benefit from modern CGI. It is more importantly another message to Hollywood that you don't touch or remake classics. An often repeated lesson from which Hollywood never seems to learn.,Ghostbusters
168,gavinp9,"Not as good as the original, but has its moments",6,2 January 2018,"'Ghostbusters' is the reboot of a classic comedy everyone saw growing up, the 1984 original. This has a pretty similar plot - they're a bunch of nerdy outcasts, with Erin (Wiig) and Abby (McCarthy) childhood-friends-turned-scientists, Holtzmann (McKinnon) as the odd engineer and Patty (Jones) as someone with a car. When the under-developed villain, Rowan (Casey), starts transporting ghosts 'across the barrier', with plans to unleash the ""fourth cataclysm"", the Ghostbusters have to save the day against a giant ghost-thing destroying New York. Sound familiar?Kevin (Hemsworth) is their dumb secretary and gets a few laughs, but like most of the side characters, he's under-used and doesn't add too much to the plot - there's also Andy Garcia as the mayor, Charles Dance as a Professor, Matt Walsh as a Government agent, Zach Woods as a tour guide, Karan Soni as the delivery boy, and obviously Murray, Aykroyd, Hudson and Weaver appear in small cameos - almost pointlessly so. The CGI's bright and colourful and the tone's light throughout, even when all the ghosts are unleashed. It gets a little silly and over-the-top at the end, but wraps up neatly.It's not as good as Feig's other recent films ('Bridesmaids', 'The Heat', 'Spy'), but it does top 'Ghostbusters II'. Plenty of jokes, with most working, except McKinnon really annoyed me as the weird one-note character. Definitely feel like Wiig could've had a few more jokes. The film certainly doesn't tarnish the reputation or memory of the original - or match it for fun and adventure - but it doesn't necessarily add a whole lot to the Ghostbusters world/franchise either.",Ghostbusters
169,jackmeat,Ample reboot of the classic but didn't need to be made.,6,24 September 2016,"My quick rating 6,1/10. Nostalgia aside I think this movie did OK on its own merits. It was an impossible task to live up to the original and I am sure many people who have reviewed this just dismissed it entirely for that simple reason. The only chance the movie really had was to be original which the makers intended to do by casting all female leads. Problem is, the movie itself was not original in the slightest. I guess it wouldn't be all that easy to reboot a franchise without taking some of the creativity from it but this movie does so in excess. Albeit done in a good way. The ghosts in the movie look great, that is for sure. The action sequences are rendered to what you would expect from a 144 million dollar budget. The main ingredient of the characters (ghostbusters) was not too bad although McCarthy and Wiig seemed very forced throughout. McKinnon and Jones though were extremely funny and held the attention of the viewers well. The stand out though wasn't a female, it was the hilarious performance by Hemsworth that nailed his deadpan comedy style perfectly throughout. I think this is a worthy reboot that even though I would prefer Hollywood just leave some movies alone such as this, they aren't going to stop remaking things. So since our voice won't be heard, at least stop destroying movies, foreign or remake alike. This time, overall, they did just fine. And in the end, we know Zuul is coming, maybe to save the inevitable sequel from losing money (to date, the movie has made 127 million).",Ghostbusters
170,Donatien3,Not worth all the hate,8,17 October 2016,"When the new Ghostbusters trailer was released earlier this year, it was howled down by fanboys.""How dare they ruin my childhood with four female Ghostbusters!"" so on and so forth. Most of the criticism was nostalgic longing, some complained about another cynical reboot while others were more sinister.So, was all that scorn worth it?No.If you leave your prejudices at the door, the new Ghostbusters is pretty good.For some, it won't compare with the original, but it's worth watching.The plot aside (two scientists –Kristen Wigg and Melissa McCarthy, an engineering whiz – Kate McKinnon - and a geographically-savvy New Yorker – Leslie Jones - bust ghosts and fight a distrustful local government), the reboot has enough nods to the original to keep fans happy.Bill Murray, Dan Akroyd, Ernie Hudson, Sigourney Weaver and Annie Potts have cameos, Slimer and the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man return and Ray Parker's iconic theme song overshadows the ""modern"" version by Fall Out Boy.Arguably the highlight is Chris Hemsworth, gleefully playing the airheaded secretary who looks pretty but can barely answer a phone.While not all the jokes hit the mark (watching ghosts projectile vomit isn't much fun), the four leads and Hemsworth make up for it, plus Murray's cameo is delightfully meta.Hate on the reboot all you want, but if you give it a chance, you might actually like it.",Ghostbusters

172,kermitkid,No need to say Boo,8,30 March 2020,"This wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be, but it wasn't amazing. I could tell they were at least trying to make something good. Having the film open with the classic ""Ghostbusters"" theme music was a strong choice that worked in the film's favor. It took me a while to warm up to Kristen Wiig and Melissa McCarthy's characters, because for the first half, they were just loudmouthed and annoying. But after a while, that stopped and I actually enjoyed their performances. That is one of the weaknesses of the film is the first half isn't very strong. There was a funny joke, and then they would immediately follow it up with an unfunny joke. Also the CGI in the movie made this year somehow looks worse than the effects of the 1984 version. How?! One thing I will say about the film was it at least had a sense of irony and meta. There's a part in the movie after they catch their first ghost and upload the video of it where they read comments and one says ""Ain't no women going to hunt no ghosts."", an obvious jab at the mysogonistic backlash some people gave this film after the first trailer was released. At least Sony was cool about it. There's a running joke throughout the film where McCarthy's character orders food but there's always something wrong with it. This was unfunny and slowed the film down, and overall just wasted time. It's not painfully unfunny, it just falls flat. I said the first half was filled with unfunny jokes, but when Chris Hemsworth enters the picture, his performance makes up for it. He's one of the best parts of the film. He totally hams it up and I could tell he was having fun with it. Some of the original cast members make cameos and while they are funny, they just distract. I was worried how this movie would be, because of how horrible the advertisements were, but surprisingly, it's very respectful of the original. Even the new versions of the theme music, both in score form, and the one by Fall Out Boy still feel like the orginal. Even though this won't be an iconic film like the original, they were at least trying. Overall, the film is like food from Jack-in-the-Box. Not horrible, but still pretty good.Grade: B 8/10 3.5/5 stars",Ghostbusters
173,Rendanlovell,An unconvincing mess,4,2 August 2016,"This is one film that I honestly never had any intention on seeing. We have all heard of the terrible marketing it had and that it's first trailer is one of the most disliked videos on YouTube ever. But what made me not want to see it was the way that this backlash was handled by the filmmakers. Calling people misogynist just for saying that the trailer was bad. Couple this with a film that looked incredibly similar to the movie that it's rebooting and I was all but out of this one. But due to the flood of people asking me to review it, here I am. Of course, the terrible marketing isn't something that I will hold against the film, because a film should be judged on its own merit.Unfortunately, I was completely correct in assuming that this movie was identical to the original. Its plot structure is essentially ripped straight from it with minor cosmetic changes being made. The film opens with a group of scientists on the verge of confirming ghosts existence. They do and are disgraced by the place they work for it. After that they proceed to continue their work flat broke. They manage to construct make shift ghost catching devices and nab one or two. The city then mostly accepts them as the Ghostbusters and life is good until a bad guy does a thing. Sound familiar? Aside from a hand full of scenes this film rarely veered from the original take in any way.Not to mention the blatant lack of any interesting characters. There's a dumb dude, a smart girl, a token black character, and an insane person. This short sum up is all that each character is. They never do anything out side of that summary and never progress into anything. So when the climatic battle takes place, are there any stakes? Nope. It's hard to get into a fight scene when you don't care about anyone or anything that is happening. Not only that but did anyone really think that anyones life was in danger? I certainly didn't. This is the kind of film that tells you early on that there are no risks and that nothing will pay off in any compelling way. And nothing does. Every time it introduces conflict or risks they are resolved so quickly that it's impossible to feel the gravity of the situation.That is only heightened more when the characters don't seemed worried at all. This boils down to the performances of the actors. Which were all pretty alright. But I believe the reason they were so unconvincing at times was due to poor direction from Paul Feig. Any time CGI is implemented on screen it is not only incredibly unconvincing, but it has no real presence. The actors are simply reacting to a green screen, and it shows.A lot of the time it looks like they are reacting to nothing. That being said, the cast is probably the biggest saving grace of the film. While they seemed to be playing themselves, they play themselves fairly well. Their SNL bonds show in the film. They all have great chemistry together and bounce off each other pretty well.While the comedy writing wasn't really my thing, their bond with each other did generate some genuine laughs. And as a whole, I thought the film was fairly well paced. There wasn't many scenes where nothing was happening. And for a film like this, I was pleasantly surprised that I didn't check my watch more often. So, I can certainly see why many people love this movie.It's fast paced, has a great cast, and offers some decent laughs. That being said, it's so alike to the original that it was near impossible to be surprised by anything. It plays out in the exact way you'd think it would and doesn't really have any depth to divert your attention from that. It's to well casted to say that it's a horrible film but it's to nonsensical and predictable to call it good. It's a movie that will disappear from my mind with in no time at all.",Ghostbusters
174,ginocox-206-336968,Worse than my abysmally low expectations,2,28 September 2016,"My expectations for the ""Ghostbusters"" remake were so low that I fully expected to be pleasantly surprised. It couldn't possibly be as bad as my cynical expectations had led me to assume. I found the original mildly amusing and the sequel forgettable. I'm not a Melissa McCarthy fan. She's okay in a minor supporting role, but lacks the range to carry a starring or co-starring role. I'm not a Paul Feig fan either, although I loved ""Spy,"" except for McCarthy. Stratham was hilarious. On the positive side, the film was buoyed by amusing performances by Hemsworth, Murray and Dance. Production values and CGI effects were good. But what is the point of having an all-girl cast if all four girls are relatively dowdy tomboys? The babe in the group, relatively speaking, is played by Kate McKinnon, who at 32 is the youngest member of the team. While slender and attractive, her wardrobe is aggressively frumpy, accessorized by a cheesy pendant with a letter U pierced by a screw. Her character seems attracted to Abby, but has no interest in Kevin. If their usual wardrobe isn't frumpy enough, their coveralls really do make them look like sanitation department employees. This isn't to say the film would have been better with a team of glamorous ladies, like ""Charlie's Angels"" or ""D.E.B.S."" However, it feels as if the cast was deliberately stripped of their femininity, as if they had been cast by the ghost of Mao Zedong. The script is a mess. Any resemblance to Campbell's monomyth, Dramatica theory, McKee, Goldman or other theories of drama is purely coincidental. The four girls become better friends as they rid the city of ghosts, but they don't grow emotionally or acquire new skills. They get new weapons, but other than some physical comedy when they try them out, they are immediately expert in their use. There's no B-story romance. None of the characters seems to have much of a life outside of work. The villain's plot doesn't seem to make much sense, but then they substitute villains for the climax. The interactions with the mayor, Homeland Security agents and Murray's character are contrived and make little sense. Somehow, billions of dollars in damage is completely undone. It's not particularly funny, other than a few bits with Dance and Hemsworth. The ghosts aren't frightening. The action isn't exciting. Despite my abysmally low expectations, the film managed to disappoint me.",Ghostbusters

176,Mcduff3601,Slightly entertaining...,4,4 February 2019,"...but in the same way when you are forced to watch your kids movie/show and they throw the occasional joke out for the parents in the crowd, the rest is boring nonsense.So I recently rewatched this movie in the hopes that somehow it got better. I thought maybe I was too hot headed with my last viewing (I was not happy what they did with my beloved franchise...MY FRANCHISE). But a second watch through years later didn't help.I think the actors were all pretty good, I have seen most of them in other things and have found them to be funny so I don't think it was the acting. I think it was mostly poor directing. The original was great because it had a kind of tension mixed with campyness and fun. There was a fine line between an 80's horror movie and and 80's comedy and the original was somewhere in between. This movie lacked any kind of tension or real horror. I will say the ghosts looked scarier but in an almost cartoon kind of way, I mean one of the ghosts that attack are a bunch of parade balloons...If this had been marketed as a movie for 7 year olds then yes it would have hit it's mark but thats not what the original was about and not what I think anyone was expecting of this movie.They could have written it in such a different way, maybe had it as a hand off from the old gaurd to the new, I mean they had all the original cast in the movie just not as themselves.The movie had such potential, it seems no one in Hollywood who makes movies is actually a fan of them these days as no one can reboot a franchise successfully.",Ghostbusters
177,themadmovieman,Yet another hugely funny film from Paul Feig and his crew,8,11 July 2016,"I'm delighted to say that I loved this film. I may not have the same nostalgic adoration for the original Ghostbusters as so many people, but I was so glad that I could enjoy this as an individual movie, one that proves that Paul Feig and his crew can do almost no wrong, thanks to a hilarious script and great performances throughout.That's the one thing that I want to emphasise about this film: it's more a Paul Feig comedy than a Ghostbusters remake. For over an hour, this film diverts hugely from the 1984 movie, focusing far more on its own characters than simply copying the original beat- for-beat. Also, as a Paul Feig movie, it's absolutely hilarious from start to finish.It might not have the same raunchy humour as Spy and Bridesmaids, but there are still so many laughs throughout Ghostbusters. Given the poor trailers ahead of the film, I expected the impressively funny start to wear off, but I was hugely surprised to find that I was laughing a good few times every minute for about three quarters of this movie, and so was everyone else in the cinema.The comedy in this film is absolutely excellent, without a doubt, and the writers did a fantastic job to make a PG-13 blockbuster so consistently funny. However, the biggest reason why I found this film so hilarious was definitely the performances.Living up to their predecessors fantastically, the lead actresses Kristen Wiig, Melissa McCarthy and Leslie Jones were all very entertaining. However, the real stand-outs from this movie are Chris Hemsworth and Kate McKinnon.Hemsworth, in a relatively small and simple role, is absolutely hilarious every time he's on screen. It's a performance that goes way beyond the bounds of anything he's done before, but he makes what would normally be a pretty repetitive role, playing the brain- dead receptionist, hugely funny, adding an extra level of humour to the film beyond the four leading ladies.But the person who was even funnier than Hemsworth was Kate McKinnon. Throughout the film, I'm certain that she accounted for 90% of the biggest laughs, even having me in tears laughing so hard at one moment. She plays Holtzmann, the bizarre but brilliant scientist, to absolute perfection, with an on-point balance between purely bizarre humour and side-splitting physical comedy, making her the brightest spot at the centre of this hugely funny movie.However, I do have one clear flaw with Ghostbusters: its story. Whilst the comedy was consistently hilarious from start to finish, when the film strays more into action/blockbuster territory, it feels a little two-dimensional and predictable. The action and sci- fi is certainly something the original did far better, and when this film tries to emulate it, it's too much like a retreading of the original, which was disappointing to see.Overall, however, I couldn't help loving this film. Yes, its story may be too similar to the original, but the rest of this film is an example of how to remake a movie. It introduces new characters that take the film in a different direction, and give it its own identity, as a fantastically funny movie with some of the best comedic performances in recent years.",Ghostbusters
178,kaptenvideo-89875,"Whoever ya gonna call, don't call the new ghostbusters!",2,10 September 2017,"Wow, is this crappy or what? Downright the worst movie I have seen in a while. To add insult to the injury, managed to stumble upon an extended Blu-ray version which is 18 minutes longer than theatrical – whopping 134 minutes in all! Yes, this is the all-girls-remake of the 1980's darling ""horror comedy"" franchise, this time starring Kristen Wiig, Melissa McCarthy, and, er, the other ones. Most of the original cast return with ""surprise"" cameos too, excluding, of course, the late Harold Ramis. This is just a sad fuckup of a movie where everybody tries and tries for two hours and more, but nothing worthwhile emerges. The only good thing I can think about the movie is that at least they have tried. For a long time, they try to make us laugh with their witty bantering dialogue and good chemistry but none of it materialises and the result is dead on arrival. Alongside ""Anchorman 2"" and ""Zoolander 2"", this must be one of the biggest failures of recent times, where they tried to bring back some cult classic and just fell on their asses. ""Ghostbusters"" is so bereft of laughs or joy that it feels shitty even by movies starring Melissa McCarthy's standards, who's still desperately trying to define and recreate this little magic she managed to create in her breakthrough role in 2011's ""Bridesmaids"". The same goes to Paul Feig, of course, who has mostly directed McCarthy's movies, the first and only creatively successful one being ""Bridesmaids"", of course. He should go back to TV world or something. Rotten Tomatoes' and Metacritic's reviews are far too kind this time, the most telling would be the latter's user score of 2.9 out of 10. The only bits I at least semi-enjoyed in the movie were original ghostbusters' surprise cameo appearances, and maybe Chris Hemworth as the good-looking but stupid assistant to the girls. He's the closest thing this ""entertainment"" had to offer to make me smile. The visual effects look cheap too, although this may be some kind of homage to original movies.",Ghostbusters
179,WalkdenEntertainment,Who You Gonna Call? No One...,5,10 January 2019,"Who you gonna call? I have no idea anymore... When the 1st Ghostbusters film hit the cinemas all the way in 1984, the film was always known for its one liners and clever jokes, but don't forget that many found the original Ghostbuster very frighting and scary.In 1989 Ghostbusters 2 finally surfaced but as you expect, it was no match for the 1st film. Many claimed that the plot for the 2nd film was a big drawback.27 years passed by in which there was always talk of a 3rd film with the key actors returning or even discussions on a new male cast to takeover.When the announcement finally came to the world that Paul Feig (director of The Heat, Spy & Bridesmaids) would be not only directing, but also changing the gender and direction of Ghostbusters the world went a little mad and crazy.Going into the film I personally didn't have any hate towards the film or major concerns. The director has made some successful comedy films but also the four leads for this reboot are in fact four very talented ladies.The films starts with a ghost invasion which shortly introduces us to the new paranormal enthusiasts Erin, Abby, Jillian who are excited to investigate their real 1st experience they have always waited and prepared for.With more and more paranormal sightings occurring our heroes see an opportunity to rise up and help the city. Joining the team is also our 4th Ghostbuster ""Patty"" and the Ghostbusters reception Kevin (Christ Hemsworth aka my twin brother lol)In no way shape or form does this film acknowledge the previous Ghostbusters films or its characters. This film is simply a reboot. Those who know the previous Ghostbusters films, we are graced with a number of hidden appearances from the original Ghostbuster actors (I counted 5 of them). While some of the appearances are fun (I get it) they could have been used in a very creative way instead of just randomly popping up...What do I think of our new Ghostbusters crew? Well, as we've seen already in many films we have the same actresses pulling out really poor, cheesy jokes. Sometimes the jokes just do not work and the joke goes on and on- like the Ghostbuster who always gets slimed on or always steps on slime, or the Ghostbuster who continuously receives her take out order incorrectly and argues with the delivery man many time. The worst joke in the film is when someone says the phrase ""Let the cat out of the bag"" only to have the film divert into two Ghostbuster questioning how it's even possible. The jokes fall flat to the point the film might as well be called something else. Most of the film's humour is brilliantly delivered by Kevin (Chris Hemsworth); the man who doesn't have glass in his glasses simply because he got sick and tired of cleaning the glass. Funny, but still very cheesy.
While a viewer may expect that when a scary ghost appears people would be worried or freak out, when these Ghostbusters see a scary Ghost you can expect poor jokes as they just stand still instead of running or worse- a Ghostbuster deciding to eat Pringles while watching her friend talk to a Ghost.
Being scared of Ghosts and adding perfectly well time humour is something the previous films did really well. It's no surprise that this reboot had big shoes to fill.Some viewers do not like the idea of the male characters in this film being either mean or incredible dumb (worse than Homer Simpson kinda Dumb). This really didn't get me down during the film.The film's plot and main villain is also forgettable. The film also tries to introduce new creative weapons (instead of the classic trap) to the point that our heroes are distorting
Ghosts, not capturing them.Be sure you stay for the end credits (very rewarding).4.9/10

181,srdjan_veljkovic,"Boring, way too long and not funny",3,1 August 2016,"The first hour and a half is very boring. Nothing interesting really goes on, attempts at humor are all misfires. The only two things that saved it so that I decided to watch the last half an hour were Kate McKinnon's and Cecily Strong's performances - while not really great, they're (contrary to the rest) something, worth a watch.Last half an hour is at least somewhat interesting. There are actually a few small jokes that kind of work. They could have cut the first hour and a half to a half an hour and we would have a short film that is not good, but not very bad. Unfortunately, as-is, it's (way) too little (way) too late.There's an interesting thing, though. That last half hour has some serious problems in directing (bad cuts and such). Don't want to speculate why is that, but, it makes you think - like, maybe the rest would have been better if it had more such problems?Compared to ""Heat"", this actually has less misandry. But, it doesn't help, really. I understand that a lot of women dream of having Chris Hemsworth as their (stupid) secretary, so, let's ignore that - though it would have been much better if any of his involvement was actually funny. But, wasting Bill Murray like he was in this is borderline criminal behavior. Similar goes for Andy Garcia, but, fortunately, quite a little bit less so.Bottom line - apart for a few little jokes near the end and a few times they played the original Ghostbusters theme song, this was boring and bad. Maybe this trend of doing ""the male movie with a female cast"" should finally come to an end. There are movies to be made with female casts, so do those - if they're good, men will watch them.",Ghostbusters
182,stormhawk2021,Who you gonna call? Someone else!,1,27 October 2021,"Well, with 5 days to go until Halloween, I want to tell you that weeks ago, I saw this movie on Netflix and switched it to another movie within 5 minutes of it started. It's surely the worst movie I have ever seen.Unnecessary remake of ""Ghostbusters"" (1984), the plot is exactly the same and does not bring anything new or good. The original is a small classic that is already part of popular culture, true, it is not a great movie, but it is good enough to have fun and be remembered by several generations (not only to those who saw it in its premiere), his mythical song ""Ghostbusters"" had quality and everyone knows it. This remake is just a copy where the only difference is that the protagonists are female instead of male (as if that were a significant novelty that justified a remake). It's not entertaining, it's boring, the main actresses aren't funny (Bill Murray, Rick Moranis, Dan Aykroyd and Sigourney Weaver possessed if they were funny), it doesn't have that black humor of the original, it has a childish humor based on falls, screams and farts. Chris Hemsworth doesn't holds a candle to Annie Potts, playing as a ditsy and bespectacled blond male secretary. Is Thor in the MCU turn into the male version of Rosemary, the Telephone Operator? (from the 70's HB cartoon ""Hong Kong Phooey""). The photography is bad, the special effects are bad, the dialogue is bad, the jokes are bad, the pacing is bad, the performances are bad, the plot is copied, the remake of the original song is gruesome. Leslie Jones and Kate McKinnon don't even have previous acting experience, Melissa McCarthy is repellent, Kristen Wiig is the only bearable. No one should see it, so they would make movies again and stop producing and releasing cash copies.PS: In my votes it only allows to put a 1, as very bad, but in reality it does not reach that score, I will have seen thousands of movies, but this one I put in the top 10 of mediocrity. So, how on earth is this as high as a 6.5? Seems like Sony got some bots or shills to cover themselves.",Ghostbusters
183,LouieInLove,Ghost-Flusters (A Story Of Anti-Creativity),3,23 September 2016,"If the original Ghostbusters had never existed would anyone think Ghostbusters 2016 was good? I doubt it. I watched the new Teenage Ninja Turtles film with my nephew last week & this new Ghostbusters film has a similar feel/vibe. I thought the new Teenage Mutant Ninja Turnip film was bloody awful n'all.This film was doomed from the outset for obvious reasons. It was politicised from the off, regardless if that was invited or not & that is always going to be a pre-laid nail in a coffin. However, If the script & casting/acting was good, that would of gone a way to justify the flipped reboot, but it wasn't. This situation only leads to highlight how bad the film is.The film really is appalling & cameos only reminded us how good the original was.As already mentioned, the casting/acting wasn't good. The Blonde lady was particularly bad. The Afro-American lady put in the best performance, albeit a bit caricatured.The original was very much in the Saturday morning matinée swashbuckling/romance tradition, whereas this film is a weird semi neo-politicised re-telling with all the Saturday matinée fun removed. This film is anti-creativity. I imagine fans of the original will be very let down. What a dumb move from executives.",Ghostbusters
184,Jerghal,"People are taking it a bit too personal, it's an okay but also unnecessary movie",7,29 September 2016,"The remake everyone hates...if we judge by the number of dislikes on youtube for the trailer. The reviews weren't too kind either. But I have seen a couple movies in my time and I think I realistically knew what to expect from this film. GB2016 is certainly not as bad as all the press would have you think. The 'if you don't like this movie you hate women' spin that Sony put on it in an attempt to shush the haters was maybe not the best approach either. It's like this: people remember the original very fondly. It had a great atmosphere, good acting and humor and brought us great entertainment. The fact that they are remaking a film that doesn't need to be remade (just watch the original again youngsters!) is enough to get anyone's blood boiling and is a large part of the reason people were p*ssed off without even having seen the trailer. Also Paul Feig (dir of Bridesmaids & The Heat) with his awkward comedy that often doesn't work and makes you squirm in your seat had me very worried. Fortunately the comedy wasn't too bad here. The 4 girls did a decent job -I very much liked Kate McKinnon with her dry in your face funniness- but they are never at the same level as the original cast. And neither would male actors have been for that matter. The VFX are decent but I was wondering the whole time why this film had cost 144m$ to make? Some people must have had some very nice paychecks. The movie looks like it could have been made for half the price... Conclusion: it's an okay film, you won't be bored (I wasn't) but it just won't be a classic like the original and it will probably be more remembered for all the controversy than for the film itself.",Ghostbusters
185,austin0731,does it live up to the hate???,6,27 August 2016,"So, the Ghostbusters reboot that has been hated on since before it even got a chance. The hate for this film was very evident since back when we first got to see the trailers for this film, which was of course not very good. But how is the actual film? The thing to make clear of is that there is nearly no way that this could ever surpass the originals but there is also no way that it deserves the amount of hate that it has deserved.I think that Ghostbusters was a good time actually, lots of funny scenes and a story that is quite alright. Unlike the original the two main members of the team were a lot less interesting instead the supposed ""supporting"" members of the team were very well realized, Kate McKinnon's Holtzman was really great in this film and so is Lesly Jones' Patty. Also I must add that Chris Hemsworth was actually quite funny in his role as the 'receptionist', Chris Hemsworth is really funny as this really stupid guy. Along with pretty great characters and chemistry between the characters we also got great visuals and action sequences. An issue that I do have is that this film seems to be pushing this whole all female team thing too hard. All the male characters in this film are either bad people in general or total idiots, now I think that it is perfectly fine to have a female team of ghostbusters but there shouldn't be a need for villainising all males and making it seem like the film has some sort of grudge towards men. Which could've been in my opinion why it has received so much hate.Now this isn't the best movie ever but I would say that I had quite a good time watching this remake of Ghostbusters and despite its targeting of men whether on purpose or not the hate that it has received is definitely way too much more than it deserves.",Ghostbusters
186,rlaine,"Like a parody of itself, doesn't work at all",2,11 December 2017,"Wasn't even planning to watch this, but decided to go anyway.I have no problem with the movie having women as lead, I was actually very surprised to read the reviews here that people were offended by the movie not having ""attractive women in short skirts and long hair"". Now that is something I can't understand. There are some problems with this new take on Ghostbusters tho, because while it promotes ladies to lead characters, it also creates a lot of unbelievably dumb male characters. This makes the whole movie feel like a parody. Like a sketch stretched to movie length. The receptionist played by Chris Hemsworth is so over the top that it's not on par with any other character in the movie, even tho most are quite exaggerated.It's difficult to judge acting as it's constant joke after a joke. I'm not a huge fan of this machine gun verbal joking which isn't based on the actual joke, but to make everything a joke. If you say something, another character turns it into a joke and the other continues with some other variation of the same joke. I'm under the impression that most of the ladies are stand up comedians and SNL actors and it kinda shows with constant verbal joking. I think there even was a line at some point where one of them said ""is everything a joke to you?"" and that's exactly how it feels. On top of that there is a super clichéd ""black character"" and a super annoying character Holtzmann played by Kate McKinnon. Kristen Wiig is OK as usual and Melissa McCarthy is quite good too. The villain was OK, but lacked a lot of depth as the movie just focuses too much on making everything a joke.I found the many cameo's quite annoying too. It made the movie feel even more like a parody. In fact it's quite like ""Scary Movie"" version of Ghostbusters. There was one scene which could've been somewhat thrilling with a ghost standing on a characters shoulders, but even then they had to have someone take a selfie with them. A real Airplane! style Zucker/Abrahams/Zucker moment. There's nothing serious about this movie. What was good with the original is that it was actually spooky at times and the characters were interesting and likable, which they aren't here. The original was a perfect mix of good writing, acting, combining funny and scary and even the story was much more interesting. The fx are OK, I've read people put them down too, but they kind of fit the very colorful and bright mood and color palette of the movie. They're CGI looking, but overall I'd say they could be worse. But for the style they chose the ghosts fit quite well.A failure in every way to me. It doesn't really work as an ""equality statement"" either because the movie is just a joke playing for almost two hours. You can't hide a lacking script and characters with fart jokes etc.",Ghostbusters

188,mistoppi,Hilarious! Definitely a new favourite,8,28 July 2016,"I haven't seen the original. I wasn't interested in Ghostbusters until I started hearing all the good things about this remake. Then I heard all the whining about this remake. That made me even more interested and determined to see this movie. And once I started to hear how most of the female audience loved this film, I had high expectations. Funny thing about high expectations - sometimes you're disappointed, sometimes you're not. I was definitely not disappointed - I love this movie so freaking much.No matter what people are saying, this movie is hilarious. The only reason I didn't laugh out loud in the theatre was that, well, I'm Finnish and didn't want to bother anyone else. Dippold and Feig are extremely talented at writing comedy.The cast is incredible. I love Kristen Wiig, Melissa McCarthy, Leslie Jones and Kate McKinnon. They are all incredibly comedians, and if you weren't convinced of their skills, this movie will convince you. My favourite thing about the leading ladies is that while they all are very beautiful women, they aren't necessarily considered attractive by the typical Hollywood heroine standards. The most attractive character might be Jillian Holtzmann, and while she's incredible cute (come one, we all have a crush on her) she's still very tomboyish. And I definitely love Chris Hemsworth as the man-bimbo eye-candy receptionist. 'Ghostbusters' uses the themes of horror and science fiction extremely well. Of course few of the jump-scares are annoying, but since it isn't exactly a scary film, it's easy to just get over them. The only very slight annoyance is how the threat of the ghosts doesn't seem too serious. There's not a one second when the audience thinks that everything is going to go to hell. But hey, it's a comedy. I don't think the original movies are any different.In short, Ghostbusters is extremely hilarious and entertaining film. I'm definitely putting it on the list of my favourites.",Ghostbusters
189,FelipeCarrillo,"The Film Most Controversial of The Year Scares, Entertains & Satisfies",9,21 July 2016,"I want to release my review - principally positive - of profane languages and emotions towards the haters, the only thing I will express would be: ""Swallow your own sh_t, fuc__ng haters"". Now, let's start.'Ghosts from Our Past' is titled the book written by Dr. Erin Gilbert and Dr. Abby Yates, in which establish how to identify and counteract a paranormal entity. The book is a failure and as a cliché of ' female buddy films ' take directions different. Erin Gilbert (Kristen Wiig) works as a professor at Columbia University, while Abby continues to studying the paranormal with a peculiar engineer, Dr. Jillian Holtzmann (Kate McKinnon), However, ghosts from past will return to torment to Erin. She find out that Abby returned to publish the book in digital platforms such as Amazon without her consent, decides to reunite with her partner for remove from the network the stormy book that will possibly ruin her life. Abby accepts with only one condition: She guiding them to a museum in New York, where powerful supernatural forces have evidenced, this, the first venue for a series of conspiracies to will free all the vengeful spirits of the city. A very suggestive and promising initial plot that will impressed even the most skeptical with the best of a summer film.We all remember with affection and nostalgia to supernatural comedy film released in 1984, directed and produced by Ivan Reitman, which left an indelible hallmark on the global pop culture and became a obliged reference for corporate films of today. Although, we are in the period of resume ideas ("" Mad Max: Fury Road ""-"" Ben-Hur "") and apparently the productions of Hollywood is being obsolete, however, this not means that all reboots has been a fiasco. 1984 are gone, and new generations deserve to know the foundations for the comedy films, therefore, Paul Feig's ""Ghostbusters"" is a complete delight. The reboot offers some tributes to the original - it is obvious, they were inspired by it - but the atmosphere is different, team is different, the spirit is different, so it has to be assessed as a individual product, it not as the cheap copy that they have sold us detractors.The relationship between the new team is palpitating, glorious and powerful; showing its hefty power in each frame. Which makes innovative and entertaining to progress of the film is not its screenplay itself, it is the analogy of its characters, the colossal and different attitudes of its protagonists, each one struggling to dominate, but it is nonviable to declare the winner, is like a frenzied crescendo. We have already seen the knowledge that McCarthy possesses for the comedy genre, with the comical film of last year ""Spy"", ""Bridesmaids"" of 2011 (directed by Feig), or even this year with ""The Boss""; a woman with a so unique and bold humor that has become the humorous lady of the decade in the film world, I am a great admirer and outside the world praises her; with so much potential, it's no wonder her performance in her last movie, boundless guffaws. Kristen Wiig goes by the same road, and despite she is not stand out like Melissa, the duo plays of wonder and remain in place of beginning to end in the film, with their supernatural form of make laugh and also cry.Rowan North (Neil Casey) plays a villain singularly strange. A guy inspired in the book of Abby and Erin that want to avenge of the world that called him weird, he is part of the heterogeneous mix developed around the film; his quality is proportional to the progress of the film - his final manifestations are fantastic, they will be a pleasant surprise for fans. North is also responsible for guiding Patty Tolan (Leslie Jones) to the team, an African American woman, who works in the subway of New York requests the help of the Ghostbusters for later inundates of laughs and exceptional moments to the audience. Holtzmann (Kate McKinnon) is the queen. She portrays a crazy engineer, with a couple of screws loose but with strengths and well represented in the corresponding scenes. Perfect and ideal complement to the team, it is not the silly addition says absurd and irritating comments, that role fell into the hands of another. Holtzman is the brain of the operation, constantly, makes improvements of her weapons, her technology and her defenses, a character special. Hemsworth has tried to venture into the comedy world, he had a small cameo the last year with ""Vacation"", but this time, he dared to be the sexy secretary of the 'Ghostbusters', Kevin, a young man with glasses without lens and with childish pants invades in the life of the quartet to fill of comments to some extent funny, but Feig knows how control it and do not exceed this resource until the end. Characters, creatures, ghosts and songs from the original are perfectly implemented by Feig and his team, something that fans will love of the original, I did it.Paul and his team have done an extravagant work, a puzzle meticulously armed which only falters in small and invisible aspects, nothing is superfluous nor badly worn, it is simply ""Ghostbusters"". I confess, when I heard the emblem song the franchise felt nostalgia, but after seeing the final result, I say with confidence: ""It was worth"". 1984 has its own, but 2016 screams perfection. Beyond of the purpose of the film (Entertainment), the extension of the film and especially the end after the credits is a clear analogy to the revocation of the female voice in a misogynist and discriminatory world , the girls say: ""we have achieved it"" and successfully, they have achieved it with honors.",Ghostbusters

I should state I saw this in 3D (which I hardly ever do), with my lady and our respective sons.I felt that it was quite funny and that the special effects were excellent. Next to 'Avatar', the use of 3D was the best I have ever seen. It's a popcorn flick well-worth seeing.

192,daniewhite-1,Ghastly,2,24 February 2020,"'Ghostbusters: Answer the call' gained a notoriety before and after its cinematic release that few mainstream studio financed films would warrant. But this one warranted its reputation.Assembled in front of the camera was a respectable amount of talent. The production was funded and scaled appropriately for acceptable production values.The script and the premise and the directing are not as worthy.A failure to create funny jokes, funny situations, funny images, funny characters, funny relationships, funny routines is a considerable failure for a comedic film.There are a handful of nice jokes and set ups. But by handful I mean really, really, perishingly few and the thudding effect of misfiring comedy efforts is deafening. Eventually this film started to make it almost interesting to mark off the failed efforts at humour, one after the other.If the film had really followed through with its premise of radically positioning itself as a beligerently female remake and gone fully anti men in a sensationally irreverent and implacably pursued effort it may have been better.Instead it declared it's intent but then failed to fire.A film that fails so utterly at its two artistic remits: laughs and subversion is barely worthy of being given any credit.Overall the very game but utterly ineffectual performances do sometimes produce a spark of human life in a random moment of a meandering scene but by and large the standard of the cast is disappointing in its own right.I seldom give scores below 3/10 but this was a chore to watch and has left me almost bereft of ideas for how to complement it.Chris Hemsworth actually added slightly to the film and played an insanely dim and ""unintelligent"" person with an aplomb I had not expected.Perhaps unsurprisingly his part was also one of the few attempts at really attacking male standards that this film got right. Here it landed a couple of ""make men the butt of the joke"" ""the laughs in you guys"" jabs in the form of stupidly funny mixed meaning jokes.Overall I rate a 2 because this film fails in its own terms as much as it does in the eyes of most of its viewers.",Ghostbusters

The original movie was , original funny and new. The remake is a remake. Why bother ? Just to put these women in the roles of men. They all make more money than us so whom cares about equal opportunity. It would be better to make a movie with regular working class people, unknowns and pay them millions.

When I was back in the early 2000s I went to Blockbuster a lot and one of the movies I rented where the original two Ghostbusters. One of the two movies I think it was the first one freaked me out when I was kid. I loved those two movies the first one is one of my favorite films of all time so like many other fans of the original when I heard bout this I was like hell no. This new Ghosbusters starts up just like the original with a ghost in a museum and one of the main characters getting fired. When she meets up with her old friend Abby (Melissa McCarthy) they go see what it's about and team up with Patty (Leslie Jones) after she encounters a ghost in the subway. With Patty now joining the team and that chick played by Kate McKinnon they must stopped a bullied soul who has taken the body of their receptionist ( Chris Hemsworth). First off the bat this movie should be funny and I laughed at least three times and it has funny situations but doesn't earn the laughter from the audience much. It even has cameos from the original cast that are made to be funny. But just aren't like there's a whole scene with Bill Murray where he gets thrown out a window by a ghost but it just didn't work, especially considering that he was the glue of the original. This movie is a reboot and it has female leads because you know SJW's and feminism. Now who knows it going to be a popular trend to take existing franchises and have the female lead or leads be women. In the making right now is an Oceans Trilogy with female leads and I heard Emilia Clarke wants to be a female James Bond and the Star Wars is having there main jedi's be women as shown with episode seven. The only difference between this film and Star Wars while they are both generic copies of there original counterparts one had good characters, actors and director. I am not a fan of most of these women aside from Kristen Wiig I think she's a good actress. But Melissa McCarthy, no just no. Chris Hemsworth he's cool too but they make and all the other men complete idiots. His character is like it's loud and rubs his eyes like seriously? Ghostbusters 2016 is not what anyone wanted it is one of the most unnecessary reboots ever made this is not a franchise that needs to do world building a misely one or two movies will do.

It's rare that I find a film these days in which there is never a dull moment, and this one completely delivered and more. Although the plot is pretty much the same as the original, it didn't feel like the first film at all. And that's mostly because the main characters. All four of the leads were astounding, hilariously funny and unique in their own ways. Kate McKinnon and Leslie Jones in particular were the funniest and completely stole the show. Chris Hemsworth plays the hunky eye-candy who ends up being just as funny and lovable as the girls. People don't think women can be smart or funny, or do anything except be sexy and silent. Well this film proves the contrary. More movies like these which challenge the status quo need to be made. Never be afraid of no ghosts, or misogynists or racists. Busting makes me feel good!",Ghostbusters
199,AdrenalinDragon,This is going to haunt me for the rest of my life,2,12 July 2016,"It has been just a little over 24 hours since I saw Ghostbusters, and it still haunts me at how awful it was. I wanted to give this movie a chance, tried to see it with an open mind, but alas it did nothing. When the first 5 minutes is the only slightly good part and only me and possibly other ghosts are watching in the cinema, you know it's going to gives you shivers.Where did it all go wrong? Could the concept of the Ghostbusters being all women work? Well, maybe(?)... if they hadn't been written so annoying and obnoxious for me to give two craps about them. Let's make them have no funny jokes and whine all the time! The new secretary guy? Make him dumb and have all the women get the hots for him, oh and plenty of failed jokes one after another to go along with that too.To be honest, the CGI isn't that great. I think the 1984 original had superior special effects. Oh, and the theme song? Way to go at ruining the iconic theme guys! What about the original Ghostbusters? Don't they appear as cameos? Yes (and this isn't a spoiler)... for like a minute each! What a waste! Any positives? Well, I guess you could argue it doesn't play out exactly the same as the original, except that's pretty much cancelled out for everything being written worse and reminded it's supposed to be a Comedy.I adore the Ghostbusters franchise, I really do. Ghostbusters II gets a lot of hate, but it truly feels like a masterpiece compared to this abomination. If you can't give us characters to care about and not be likable or redeemed, why bother? Yes, some of the original Ghostbusters were jerks, but they all had a heart as well. Where were the laughs? Why change the iconic things about the series? You know what? Just stick with the Ghostbusters Video Game as the last Ghostbusters, and pretend this so called Ghostb... I mean Ghostjokers never existed.2/10",Ghostbusters
200,peeedeee-94281,Works Better As A Parody than Remake/Reboot,4,13 October 2019,"The opening scenes during that tour almost lost me. Horrible horrible jokes. I was concerned it was going to go that way for the whole movie.
Thankfully it didn't. The story isn't the same as in the original movie, so why even call it 'Ghostbusters'? Why not call it 'Ghostbusters 2.0' or 'Ghostbusters: Next Gen'?
The jokes I did enjoy were the sly little references to the original movie, like the way the logo was created, or the way the name 'ghostbusters' was finally adopted.
The parts I didn't like were, the technology, which was really dumb (especially in that final fight scene); the initial haunted house scene and follow-up, which seemed random, not related to anything, but apparently tied to the grand scheme of things. I was confused with that initial scene before the intro credits, was the guy possessed or not? It was very confusing. It seemed like that whole beginning, and the characters, were going to play more of a role later, but you never see them again.
And what was the motivation of the putting all those cyber-punk contraptions all over the city? And how come nobody at the hotel noticed he had a giant laboratory in the basement of the building?!! Too many contrived and unexplained scenes that those that made it hard to enjoy. Then there was the finale.
The ending where Kristen Wiig ties here self with a cable and jumps into that vortex was especially bad. Clearly borrowed from Poltergeist, but what didn't make sense was how was she expecting to get back?!! I mean, it wasn't a bungee cord, and nobody was seen pulling her and McCarthy back at the end? They just sort of bounced back. It was baaaad.
Chris Helmsworth was funny as the ditsy receptionist, but some of the gags got tiresome after awhile with him.
All of the cameos with people from the original movie were awesome. Too bad Rick Moranis didn't make an appearance as well.
Overall, the movie is a good Saturday afternoon movie, but it definitely didn't hold a candle to the original film.",Ghostbusters

203,RhapsodyReviews,Funny with a Great Story.,7,28 August 2019,"Review:
'Ghostbusters' is an American supernatural-comedy film directed by Paul Feig. It is a reboot of the 1984 film of the same name and is the third film in Ghostbusters franchise. I watched this movie over half a dozen times now and I swear it gets more and more funny every time I watch it. I really believe that people are just stuck in their ways and will never come to terms that anybody can play any character. This movie is called ""Ghostbusters"" and has the same premise as the original, but it tells a different story entirely.
The story focuses on four women (Melissa McCarthy, Kristen Wiig, Kate McKinnon and Leslie Jones) and their assistant (Chris Hemsworth) who begin a ghost-catching business in New York City.
Everybody in this movie is so funny! Each actor played their role perfectly. When the movie needed to be more than just funny, they got the actors who can act do those roles - Melissa McCarthy and Kristen Wiig - that's not taking anything away from the amazing and wonderful that is Kate McKinnon. The characters are great, but the main trio really take this movie to heights that not even I would have expected.
No where is the story does it say that the characters had to be played by men, nor did it say it had to be played by women. The creators of the film decided on what they thought would work best, and it turned out be a funny and entertaining film. Get on board with the equality train people, it's 2019 and anybody can do anything they want. Story, comedy and characters I really enjoyed. They did a good job playing homage to the original film and characters; however, they stretch it out throughout the whole film and intertwin the Easter Eggs into the story itself and I found myself at times being taken out of the main story because of it.
Overall, this it not your 1984 'Ghostbusters'. If you can get past that and actually enjoy the story that a new generation is trying to tell, you can really enjoy this film.

I have no problem with a female cast, and the hateful comments directed at the actors and director on social media in the months leading up to release made me want it to at least be a passable comedy. It isn't. It REALLY isn't.The script is flabby and repetitive, the characterisation charmless (Kristen Wiig particularly), and what gags aren't lifted from the original are painfully telegraphed (especially those relating to Wiig's letching after dopey Chris Hemsworth). The original had a sharp script, excellent and distinctive characters and sufficient style and sass to be remembered - and repeatedly referenced in other media - three decades later.

206,tkaine3,The Ghostbusters are back and this time it will be 4 heroines saving NY city from a ecto plasmic meltdown.,9,23 July 2016,"""The Devil Is A Lie"" Now I am so upset for listening to these backwards uninformative critics I delayed in taking my 9 yo. Daughter to see the new unveiling of the Ghostbusters but boy once the movie started I had a delightful adventure for the entire movie. Now every name as you already know is a big name in this movie so speaking about any comedic genius or acting credits specifically I will not do. What I will do is lay out the format of a great movie just a little bit and speak on how the new squad worked marvelous together. The movie is hilarious from the start the cutey Kristen Wiig kicks it off with her usual laugh out loud comedy antics and The story line is her weening over becoming a tenured professor at a prestigious academic University the funny situation which I won't express brings her into contact with an old friend who is Melissa McCarthy and her new colleague Kate McKinnon with seemingly crackpot inventions at a run down 2 bit science school that gives them the boot. Soon after there first run in with the first ghost which the special effects of everything I really do not even have to speak of because just knowing the original movie in the 80's was superb, Of course that part of the 2016 movie is not lacking with a $144 mil budget. Once they secure a secretary played by the prettyboy Chris Hemsworth who managed to put idiocy on a whole new level and get a call that leads them to Leslie Jones the last Ghostbuster there's no denying the new ghostbusters have a camera charisma that is a style all of their own and all of them different but beautiful in their own right along with being hilarious as a team. Even bringing back the cameos of my favorites and the original ghostbusters except for 1 was a good mix and spread out through out the whole movie, But no cameo appearance out did the main characters which was a plus. Also I should mention Every commercial or trailer scene was not in the movie there were many more funnier scenes they did not show.Now the score of the movie in the very beginning they played the original tune for the Ghostbusters and it was a good introduction to getting us back into the ecto plasma vibe of the 80's, But by the time we were rolling with the new busters jazzing it up and bringing us up to speed 30 yrs. later was a very good new rendition or new arrangement of the old song which started to play about a half hour later. Some critics said that it was a hack or a bad song which is totally not true, it's not like an anthem that the original was, But The New song has a great beat, Good arrangement, Amazing male singing vocals and a quick sample of a female rapping nicely or as I would say a good flow. Now I myself am a professional rap artist who does it for a living and I have been creating music for just over two decades and I liked the song. Now the artists on this song that I am speaking about were Fallout boy & Missy Elliot I don't know the numbers exactly but I think between the two they may have sold over 10 million records combined I think it's a pretty safe bet to say they know what they are doing. Now there is maybe a couple jokes that may not strike everyone the same but that's what a good diversity of comedy is supposed to do and if it's not funny to you then you just may not be as cool as most of us and that's OK your a critic it's not your job to be cool because I understand we are all not equally spread with the same circumstances in life to give us the same reactions to different situations but when I watch the fault in our stars I love that movie for the mindset it puts me in for they're circumstances even if I don't have cancer or a life threatening illness. My life's circumstances are not the end all be all and yours shouldn't be either. As for me this movie hit the mark.There was a scene that was a lot better in the trailer because they cut a scene for commercial purposes to make seem more funny when Kristen was in the restaurant at the end speaking to the mayor it wasn't set up the same way on the movie so that was a scene which should of been way more hilarious but was wasted. All in all the pace the premise the persistent placement of folly and parodys were all plausible in a ghostly world that's a family friendly film. I hope they do well enough to succeed financially from such a big budget I really would like to see a part 2. It Definitely lived up to its potential and I give it 9 out of 10 stars..

207,abouhelier-r,The Ectoplasmic Force Awakens,8,28 September 2016,"Paul Feig, director of Bridesmaids, and co-writer Katie Dippold, who gave us Parks and Recreation on TV, deliver another sparkly script which is different and also more self-aware. ""There's no such thing as bad publicity"", Paul Feig may well disagree, since his all-female version of Ghostbusters trailer was the first to ever gained the arguable distinction of being, the most disliked trailer on YouTube. It couldn't be simply because the film has the temerity to feature four women as its ghostbusting quartet, could it? Not in 2016? What made the original Ghostbusters an instant classic in summer 1984 was the instant chemistry between Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis and Ernie Hudson; plus, this combination of high-IQ smart and dumb silliness. This time around, McCarthy and Wiig: two of the finest comedy actresses currently working, are on good form as usual. Though, Melissa McCarthy only gets to unleash her talent for physical comedy in a demonic possession and then you're starting to wish guiltily McCarthy had taken centre stage, using the crazy vitality and improvisation skills that made The Heat and Spy hits. This film also aims for broader humour, which is most obvious with Chris Hemsworth as Kevin, he's responsible for many of the film's biggest laughs as he struggles with simple tasks such as answering the phone or making coffee. It's one of the movie's more inspired gags to flip the sexual harassment in the other direction, offering up Thor hunk as the group's straight man, an assistant too dumb to realise he's being objectified. In a way, the breakout star turn is McKinnon - a graduate of TV's SNL. She has a kind of resilient improvisation eccentricity and natural comedy that is closest in spirit to Bill Murray from the first film. Not that such comparisons are necessary or desirable. She makes for a sublime nerd goddess and she embodies the new Ghostbusters at its best: girl rules, women are funny. Get over it. Though it would have been nice if Ms Jones had been given more to do. If this were a radical reboot, she would have played a scientist. After an effective opening scene, the film does prove to be funny, as Feig and McCarthy's collaboration tend to be. Plus, as it is often the case with a big-budget feature, it grows progressively louder and bigger, climaxing in an overlong battle. Part of what makes this reboot enjoyable is that it allows women to be as simply and uncomplicatedly funny as men. Moreover, this movie is also a female friendship movie, but without the usual jealousies and boyfriends. It took someone like Paul Feig to redefine who gets to be funny in movies. And it's what makes him a thoughtful successor to Mr Ramis, who made a series of memorable, soulful comedies about what it means to be a man such as Groundhog Day or Multiplicity. Finally, this film is at once satisfyingly familiar and satisfyingly different, kind of like a new production of Macbeth or a Christopher Nolan rethink of Batman. Now if we could just get women and men to be funny together, that would be revolutionary. Overall, this film just feels funny, a novelty to those who believe that being funny is an XY chromosome thing. It pays tribute to the 80s blockbuster with in-jokes and cameos. Delivering a really funny and spectacular action comedy while producing a brand new work.",Ghostbusters

210,SpoilerAlertReviews,"Better than Paranormal, less the hate.",7,12 July 2016,"Director Paul Fieg teams up yet again with Melissa McCarthy and a Saturday Night Live line up cast which follows trend of the original 1984 cult classic. Being a female reboot, you try to figure out who's respectably who; is McCarthy Ramis and Wiig Murray? Each character having similarities while still oozing something new. The person who stole the show was SNL regular and TV comedy personality, Kate McKinnon who resembles Ackroyd's Ray, only a little more crazier and somewhat crankier to full comedy effect. Another SNL regular joins the team, the giant Leslie Jones who I reckon would make a great celebrity death match for Game of Thrones Gwendoline Christie. Andy Garcia plays the mayor but is nothing like David Marguiles' mayor from the first. And Chris Hemsworth's Kevin as an answer for Annie Potts' Janine, playing a dumber than dumb partially blind and deaf receptionist. I think they actually doped him up before takes. Neil Casey, yup, another writer from Saturday Night Live, plays the bad guy nut job who's going around waking all the spooks up. I think I preferred it when Gozer came to town. It's a very similar story, with some interesting tweaks for background paying respect to the originals. The old famous Hook & Ladder Company #8 building makes an appearance, along with Ecto1 (though missing the annoying yet lovable siren) Slimer and his nasty appetite and the usual proton-packs with upgrades. The Stay Puff Marshmellow Man gets a facelift and the cameos are brilliantly placed but no Moranis.Theodore Shapiro does the score but gets sounded out by the soundtrack, which is actually a lack of and its been reported Ray Parker Jr. isn't happy with Missy Elliot and Fall Out Boy's rehash version. There's no Mick Smiley's Magic or Laura Branigan's Hot Tonight. Same premise as the original, possibly playing to fresh fans, this might do what the '84 classic did for us oldies, (middle-aged) and should it matter if it's an all female cast? It's funny with some very good moments but unfortunately there's plenty of mediocre comedy that just doesn't hit home. It's a little longer than the original and it does feel it in parts and the effects are what you would expect, they're good but nothing really mind-blowing that we haven't already seen before. Seeing a lot of hate, and low scores and to be honest, being apprehensive and a big fan of the originals, it's a good reboot, its a carbon copy yes, but how else would anyone expect to make a reboot and the fact the film pays so much respect to the originals and especially with the cameos I find it hard to hate it. Hater's gonna hate and they need to let go. It's more than 30 years on and yes, I was around when the original came out, so come on, it's a not a bad fresh start to the franchise.

If this was my first time seeing a Ghostbusters film my score would probably be higher but any reboot is simply not going to have the awe-effect and magic of being the first. That being said my enjoyment level was on par with the original Ghostbusters and it was far better than Ghosbusters II.I hope they continue the franchise and we see more sci-fi comedy films as that would be a refreshing break from the over-saturated comic book market. Ghostbusters was a refreshing change of pace and it's the only film I've seen in so long I can't remember where I laughed out-loud, jumped a couple times, and enjoyed big-budget special effects. Lots of great cameos and great summer fun.Better to see in the theaters as the comedy will still be fun at home but the effects simply won't translate. And it's in Real 3D, so, worth it to see in 3D on a big screen.

214,caseynicholson,"Fun, and Good--But Not as Good as the Original",7,4 August 2016,"I finally caught the ""Ghostbusters"" reboot before it left theaters, and I thought it was a good, solid film--but just not quite as good as the original two films.On the plus side, this movie brings back most of the fun elements of the original two movies. There are scenes that at times flirt with being scary all while keeping a comedic vibe overall. The banter between the all female leading cast is witty and keeps up with the original cast. And, the original cast themselves make a few cameos--although one should note that this is a complete reboot and not a continuation of the original series. The cast of the original films play entirely different roles in this movie, and it's as though the first two films never even happened, so there's absolutely no reason to have to watch the first two films before seeing this one.That having been said, there are a few drawbacks to the film. One is that the banter between the all female leads does at time become a bit lewd in a way that the original films never were--I found that to be troubling since part of the fun of Ghostbusters has always been its appeal to children. Sure, the first two movies had their fair share of swear words, but having watched them both recently, they didn't have the same tendency for lewd humor that this movie has.Aside from that, the film is good but not great. It pays homage to the original well without being a complete rip off of its source material--but it nevertheless falls short of being on par with the originals.Having said that, though, I'd be a complete liar if I didn't note that Kristen Wiig is my new celebrity crush. :-)7/10 stars.",Ghostbusters
215,autisticreviewers,Autistic Reviewers Opinion Of This Movie.,4,13 July 2016,"When the announcement of a new Ghostbusters movie was made, fans had back-lashed and trolled on the internet and social media on how this was going to be bad, then things just got worse when the trailer arrived (it went on to become the 12th disliked video on YouTube) further dragging the reboot to be a successful one. But having finally watched it from my own eyes with my mind set off the reality of working life, I will honestly admit and truthfully confess that this reboot was actually better and not as horrible as people made it out to be.The comedic performances of the leading cast were good, with Melissa McCarthy, Kate McKinnon, Chris Hemsworth and Kristen Wiig being the standouts on performance and comic delivery. The cameos and nods to the original film were present, but interesting enough that this reboot can stand as its own movie as there is no past mention of the characters involved in the original. The cameos from Murray, Aykroyd, Weaver and Hudson are all enjoyableThe direction of Paul Feig was great as usual, having already established his style of comedic storytelling with wedding comedy 'Bridesmaids', female buddy cop flick 'The Heat' and the surprisingly entertaining and hilarious take on the spy genre 'Spy' but the humour this time is often subtle and never relied heavily on gross toilet humour which is a good thing for me but depending on how you like your comedy films you may want better or more.Overall, the film will get more of a bashing and trash talk out of than praise but I am giving it a positive review for it as I was entertained throughout and I think this will be an underrated or even ignored film for the generation. Just hope it's not a box office bomb in the coming weeks, and I wouldn't mind seeing it again or even get a sequel maybe.3.5/5 - NickWe both grew up watching Ghostbusters 1 and 2. They were both entertaining and charming in so many ways. It captured this amazing comedy/Horror that made it a world wide success. Sadly, for me, and for millions of other people in this world this movie didn't do anybody any favors.When the trailer was released it became the most hated and disliked trailer ever in youtube history, and that's saying a lot! While I definitely would not say I hated this movie, it definitely didn't work for me. It had its moments of charm and humor, and eve scariness, but the cast and the situations they put themselves in just seemed lazy and you could almost every time when they were in front of a green screen. The magic wasn't there. Even the final showdown (while entertaining) wasn't long enough. It had nothing to do with them being female...it has to do with the fact that it wasn't the original cast. Even if you had different male leads it still would've been hated. The original cast just captured the magic.All in all, it wasn't a horrible movie, there are many references and the film makers giving tribute to the old ones, but I simply didn't like it. It didn't work for me. Hemsworth also was really bad in this one. 4/10. 1.5/5 stars. Jay",Ghostbusters
216,iamtherobotman,Busted!,1,29 July 2016,"To start with i don't hate this film because it's an all female lead cast, i hate this film because it's just a bad film.When i heard three or four year ago there was plans to make a 'new Ghostbusters film' with female leads, i cringed. When i saw the initial Trailers, i felt embarrassed for them and eventually i decided to stream this film( i'd refuse to pay ) and all my fears were realised.I detest this fixation in recent years of taking old Films and rebooting them and i'd love this one to be the one to break the Camels back. To essentially take a classic film, and attempt to reinvent it is lazy film making, to take that classic and swap a male lead cast for a female one is a sad indictment of today's society, where everything has to be Politically Correct and inline with this Third Wave Feminism which is sweeping majestically across the Universe.This Film is poor on many levels. The script is awful, the jokes are lame, unfunny and all too obvious. The Cast are terrible. They're just not funny, regardless of whether they were Male or Female - It says it all when the funniest one is Hemsworth who, lets face it, isn't known for his Comedy roles. The Females almost stumble through their lines, their ability and delivery of this lame material is boring and from what i've seen of them in the past, typecast. The Story is a clumsy reworking of the originals and nowhere near as engaging. The original had its faults, it wasn't a perfect Film but it had a storyline. This has a loose storyline which is far to stupid for words. They've added a few nods to the originals, obviously in an attempt to garner a bit of support from fans of those films but even these are handled clumsily and lazily, seemingly thrown in randomly just for the sake of it.They went all out for joke after joke after joke, making the Film seem like a near 2 hours of the worst stand up in the history of stand up. Almost every line is a set up followed by a punchline, followed by another set up....... Yet the jokes just aren't funny and Wiig in particular has such a dire delivery of lines ( in anything i've seen her in), always unsure, mouse like, shy, retiring. It's all fair enough if the character calls for it, but here she's meant to be a Professor and therefore presumably intelligent, not a shrinking, oppressed Secretary too scared to voice her opinion.I found it hard to believe that these four Women are actually Comedians and from what i understand, they're well thought of Comedians. That is a terrifying thought. I know funnier Women than these four who work down the local Supermarket and naturally funny, unforced.As other reviews have touched on,every Male character in this Film was either braindead or Mr Evil. The Women held the power and obviously so. This was an extremely lame attempt at 'Girl Power' which for me, only resulted in denting the true Feminists stance. It's time for the White Knight who is Paul Feig to climb on his trusty mount and ride off into the Sunset with the four leads in shackles being dragged behind him while wearing only Loin Cloths.This is a travesty of a mockery of a sham.",Ghostbusters
217,morganstephens512,Why?,2,14 July 2016,"I could not care less if it had a all male or all female cast. What I want to say is I am so sick and tired of seeing remakes of movies that were already perfectly fine to begin with. We are getting at least three or four remakes each year when it is unneeded. In fact it comes out as lazy and desperate. Ghostbusters was already fine enough. We don't need a dumb remake of it, regardless of what you do, it will be the same. We are sick of it and we want something new. If you are going to remake a movie, do the really bad movies like Battlefield Earth. I am angry. Not because of the leads, but because of the fact that Hollywood is lazy that they have no respect for our minds and what we really want in movies. A FRESH and GOOD experience. If we wanted to see Ghostbusters so badly, we would just watch the original Ghostbusters.That is my opinion on the premise of the movie. Regardless, I will still see and then grade it as a movie and not what I feel about it being a remake. As a idea, I give it a big fat 1/10, as a movie, I am guessing about a four or so.Edit: I saw the movie and am just coming back. It as awesomely awful. I was laughing along with the theater the entire time. Like belly aching laughing the whole thing. Everything about it was awful, with almost no proper representation of anybody. It was incredibly sexist to BOTH genders and racist to EVERY race in the movie. Also, I did a gender counter of everybody who had at least one line and holy lord, out of the 41 people who had at least one line, 28 were men and 13 were women. That's right, in a women power movie, over two thirds of the characters who spoke at least once were men. Not to mention that literally every single plot point was dis regarded after about five to ten minutes. It really is worth seeing for how funny and bad it is. It might even be the number one example of 'so bad it's good' of the year. As a comedy, I give it a ten (for all the wrong reasons) but as a movie, a one or maybe two is all it deserves. So yes, it is even worse than I assumed. But worth it worse.",Ghostbusters
218,danielharden,GirlBusters,7,17 July 2016,"32 years ago Bill Murray, Harold Ramis, Dan Aykroyd and Ernie Hudson would form the Ghostbusters and save New York from many paranormal beings such as Slimer and Mr Stay Puft (just to name a few). Now in 2016 the franchise has been rebooted but with a twist, this time the Ghostbusters are women... ""WHAT IS THIS"" the internet exclaims. ""HOW DARE THESE WOMEN TAKE ON THE ROLES THAT HAVE BEEN MADE FAMOUS MY MEN!!!"". As the saying goes ""haters gonna hate"" and hate they did as the films official trailer is now the most hated movie trailer ever, and is in the top 25 most hated Youtube videos of all time. Oh the misogyny. I would like to make clear that I am not one of the misogynistic haters to which I am referring to. Like some who disliked the trailer, I didn't like it due to other reasons, as I thought the CG didn't look great and the jokes weren't all that funny, but my interpretation was that hopefully the best is yet to come.I think the best place to start is with the Ghostbusters themselves. I thought they were alright as a whole. Kate McKinnon and Leslie Jones were great in this film especially McKinnon as the incredibly smart as she is eccentric, Jillain Holzmann. Both fresh off SNL, the two bring real character to the film and ultimately steal the show from such familiar faces like Kristen Wiig and Melissa McCarthy. It's not that Meliisa McCarthy and Kristen Wiig are bad because they aren't, it's that they play themselves, or at least a version of themselves that we have seen in many a movie and so they aren't as fresh as their fellow Ghostbusters. I also found Kristen Wiig's character slightly irritating with her need to impress people like Bill Murray and Charles Dance, but then again the rest of the team (even unofficial member Kevin) help weigh the scale on the side of good. Speaking of Kevin, Chris Hemsworth is given a rather well written character in Kevin the Secretary, Hemsworth is given the funniest character with the funniest lines and gives a decent performance, but it is more the writing that makes Kevin so entertaining more than Hemsowrth's performance (Although he (ghost)busts some moves in the credits that will make you chuckle).Now for the film itself. It's a fair film, its funny in places and it entertains those with an open mind. One of the stand out moments of the film would be the Beast's of Mayhem concert scene. In the scene Leslie Jones is given some really funny things to do such as the crowd dive and the ghost on her shoulders. As well as this scene, the many scenes where Holzmann showcases her latest inventions make for great entertainment and shows why these two are the films best characters.A problem I had with the film was the number of nods and winks to the original film. I don't think it's ""VOMITTING ON YOUR CHILDHOOD"" as some would think, its just a bit too staged and frequent for a film that wants to stand on its own. The only other real issue I had with the film was its ending. The films climax is ironically anticlimactic as there is no real sense of danger or struggle for our friendly neighbourhood Ghostbusters. Instead the ending feels a bit too easy and doesn't deliver on the excitement you would expect of a final showdown.Overall, Ghostbusters is a fair film with an unfair amount of hate surrounding it. With such negative hype the film is never going to live up or down to it, instead the film sits happily in the middle, and in my case the scale is tipped more over the good side. I would be interested to see more of these Ghostbusters and encourage sequels as I think, to be honest, the only way is up for Ghostbuster sequels. So to all the ghosts and haters out there all I say is this. THE POWER OF PATTY COMPELS YOU!",Ghostbusters

It is not Shakespeare. But as light-hearted entertainment, I thought it was definitely among the best I've seen....some idiot is ""reviewing reviews"", and claims that positive reviews are by people with new accounts here. I have been posting and rating movies at IMDb for nearly 18 years. And I say, if you liked the original 1984 Ghostbusters, you will probably like this. You might even prefer it to the original.All four of the lead ladies are pretty excellent, but McKinnon's wackiness is the best, IMO.",Ghostbusters
220,trans_mauro,"It has bombed, as it should and deserved",1,22 September 2016,"Another remake, another politically correct reinterpretation of something good, and another mess.First of all, who came up with the idea that Melissa McCarthy is a comedian ? Without the support of good actors and a really good script she is only an abrasive character, playing the same type of annoying person. And her voice is very very irritating. And Kristen Wiig, playing the straight character is as bland and boring as a white wall.Second, women are not funny, they do not know to make humour. It is simple as that. Their jokes, situations are all contrived, forced and unnatural.Third, for a comedy, laughs are very rare in this new version of Ghostbusters. Curiously, the only actor who is remotely funny is Chris Hemsworth playing a the male version of a blond bimbo.Ghostbusters is one of those ""meh"" films that adds nothing.",Ghostbusters
221,thepriceofpayne,Who you Gonna Call? NOT THEM,5,25 July 2018,"I'm putting all controversy aside for this film, because I'm one of the very few who was excited from the trailer. I mean the film has a great cast, a capable director, and it's the Ghostbusters what could be wrong? Well let's do this, first off the film is needlessly a reboot. With so many movie sequels coming out years and years after the original, Ghostbusters has an opportunity to do a continuation but instead decided to reboot a movie that didn't deserve a reboot, and nothing will ever be that first film from 1984, so the least you could do was give an entertaining follow up, but no remake it. I wouldn't mind that much if the plot and story left something to be desired but it's actually a very standard story which doesn't make for an interesting take, it basically Re-tells the original with a female cast and setting it in modern day. Speaking of which the cast, I actually love this cast Kate McKinnon and Chris Hemsworth give great performances and are definitely the heart of the movie, they are the only two that feel like their own characters. While I love Mcarthy, Jones, and Wiig who are all hilarious women and great actresses, there characters are not memorable and they aren't really given anything funny to say. It feels like Feig and the cast were told to play it safe and that's evident from the writing, effects, and awkward cameos. Finally last but not least, I personally always saw Ghostbusters as an interchangeable team, one that could have many different people with different genders or race or whatever, and an all female cast is not bad, but that shouldn't be a The whole point of a film. (especially Ghostbusters) This is a film that feels like it could've been so much more, but instead is a forgettable yet innocent feature that just needs more creativity and comedy that made the franchise work in the first place.",Ghostbusters

Remember when this movie came out and they said, ""you don't think it was funny because their women"". Well guess what? It's not funny because you have women trying to act like men and they aren't funny. Women can be funny. Carol Burnett for example. For a matter of fact Melissa was funny until she got big. Then she got lame. And this blonde who does Hillary imitations. She is so not funny. And her imitation of Hillary was horrible as well. And I don't like Hillary. And than the one who is trying to play the straight. That character is so weak. No one like a weak character.",Ghostbusters

It is just a watchable light summer movie. Movies biggest problem is, that it is too similar to original movie. It is more remake than it's own movie. Too bad, because with new digital effects and with better script this could be much better movie. Maybe movie makers have been thinking how to maximize profit and trust more copying the original movie than try to make something new. Best part of the movie is Ghostbusters secretary (Chris Hemsworth) who looks good, but seems to be just a beefcake. Movie is best to watch in 3D when it's CGI looks best.

This should have been pulled until they could develop a script.Clearly the studio got greedy and shoved this through the pipe. The only actor is this film that came off as funny is McKinnon.

Even that was depressing!Fine, movie. You want to have women in the hero (heroine, actually) role. This is a great example of how not to do it.This movie is nothing more than a repeat of the original. Except without the jokes. And with a lot of political correctness thrown in.No thanks. I'm glad I didn't pay to watch it.",Ghostbusters
226,cnycitylady,Not totally 'Busted',6,2 February 2017,"The Ghostbusters all female reboot has taken some shots, I'll admit. Maybe some even deservedly so, but how many of those shots were taken after the people saw the movie? After they judged it on its own merit and not in comparison to the now classic original it's set to reboot? None, I'll bet, and that's a shame, because it really isn't all that bad.This movie works on a few levels, the first being that it's funny. Say what you will about it, but you can't deny the sheer comedy power that these ladies have and share. This reboot was, in my opinion at least, way funnier than its predecessors which, to me, came across as more scary than they meant to be. The female comedians make less obvious slap stick jokes and are funny because they each in turn poke subtle fun at their own remade version. Yes making this reboot the mere butt of the joke does come across as belittling their own skills as comedians and actors, but not so much that you cannot enjoy how funny the jokes are. ""Ain't no bitches gonna hunt no ghosts,"" was one of the funniest things I've heard all year.Another thing that worked for this movie was how persistent it was in not simply copying what came before. A few homages and cameos were thrown in to appease the woman hating purists out there, but all in all the script didn't rehash what we've already seen and let the Ghostbusting world take on new problems. I enjoyed a new Ghostbusters story-line so much that it kept my mind off of the fact that this was indeed an unnecessary remake.There were a few things, however, that didn't work for the film. The biggest problem it had was making this reboot an all female one without actually making the women, women. Each character could have easily been played by a man, or even a putty monster. There was nothing specific in this movie that made it mandatory for them to be women or that propelled feminism or women rights. It was a hugely wasted opportunity. You expect them to tackle these things with something that identifies them as women but instead they just make their GhostPacks pink. Oooh pink because they're girls. Give me a break...The original Ghostbusters worked so well because it was original. It worked because it came out in a time where campy, corny fun was all the rage. In this more cynical and jaded world a movie like this has no staying power. It was a great go at revamping a beloved franchise, but I can't help but think that under a different guise this movie would have done better. Dressing up this ghostly comedy as Ghostbusters didn't take, but if you called it anything else then it would have held its own. That being said, this movie was not bad. Not bad at all. Not the best movie ever, but not bad. 6/10",Ghostbusters
227,The_Dead_See,"Messy and imperfect, but still lots of fun and very respectful to the original",7,16 July 2016,"To set the context for this review, I came at this movie as a middle aged guy who grew up loving the original and I don't care one bit about the ""all-girl"" reimagining. I wasn't impressed by the trailer much and I was worried it would be unfunny since nothing on the trailer made me crack a grin. All I went in hoping for was an entertaining movie, and that's exactly what I got. What surprised me was that I also got more than bargained for. I was pleasantly surprised me with how respectful of the original it turned out to be - even having the courage to open with the original Ray Parker soundtrack instead of the modernized 'Madeon' sounding one on the trailer. It's got to be a really tricky task to navigate a route between a brand new story and a classic old one, but they pulled it off nicely, giving plenty of amusing nods and homages to the source material while still managing to tread fresh ground.Another nice surprise was that the trailer hadn't shown all the cards, which is unusual for an A-list film these days. The villain and his nefarious plot wasn't shown on the trailers, and the role of Chris Hemsworth was hugely downplayed (he actually has a much bigger part in the movie than the trailers suggest).Although I was surprised by the anti-female backlash directed at the trailer, I was initially offended that the only black member of the cast appeared to have been once again relegated to the non-smart, non- scientist role. But while the character isn't a scientist, she is played as the smartest of the group - passionate about New York history and the one that puts most of the mystery pieces together, which was nice.Hemsworth steals the show really, he's clearly enjoying making a fool of himself and you'd have to be in a pretty bad mood as a viewer not to let that enjoyment infect you a little. He hams it up with glee and that's enjoyable to watch.As for the supposed ""feminist agenda"", I really didn't see it. There's a little material that seems to have been added maybe as an afterthought, poking fun at the youtube commenters, and there's a couple of jokes which I guess could be construed as ""feminist- agenda"" if you were really desperately stretching - a line about how ""safety lights are for dudes"" for example, or a moment where they shoot the evil ghost in his twig and berries, but you seriously have to be stretching to think this an anti male movie.I've seen some reviews on here about how it was unfunny and cinema audiences being ""in silence"". All I can say to that is the auditorium I was in was only half full and there was plenty of laughter. A few of the jokes were misses for me, but there were enough that made me laugh aloud to let the weaker ones slide.Probably the only big downfall for me was the messiness of the script which seemed to lack a second act. It feels a bit like it jumps from the intro act to the climax without much of a build in the middle. I'm not sure if it was a product of the writing or the editing, but it's not much of an issue since, let's be honest, we're not expecting an Oscar winning script from a Ghostbusters movie anyway.In summary, it's fun, it's entertaining, it's good natured, and it's respectful of the original. It's not feminist, it's not unfunny, and it's not perfect.",Ghostbusters
228,stonedraim,Ghost jumpers...?,5,15 October 2016,"**** May contain strong spoilers ****This is a review made by StoneDraim... and that means that if you want to read a probably different kind of review, keep reading....This is my personal experience, my personal point of view/perspective and my personal opinion... and my opinion is just one of like 7 billions in this world.Going right into my agenda and opinion. I will express my honestly and early thoughts and prejudice about this motion picture. I have extreme low expectations... I think this will be another ""Melissa McCarthy"" ""fooling around"", naive and juvenile kind of way, and I think this film will tend will use and play so to speak on prejudice and stereotypes about both the movie industry and the viewers intelligence. I think this will be an great disappointment. Now I click on play button and let me see if they had the audacity to keep the legacy of the ""real"" Ghostbusters alive and well._______________In the first couple of minutes, the alarm and radar for bad acting, bad directing and maybe so, bad script. Things to obvious happens, things that is strange to say, strange to convey is taken in consideration here and gives me the creeps, as I usually get when I watch just about approved or worse movies. Even bad visual cutting; the guy touches the door knob and burn his hand. then they cut to when he is standing and holding his hand. Clearly, I could see the difference between the takes. The body movement and the facial expression is different during the cutting. Oh, well...Hollywood and the movie industry has made an jackpot out of pushing Melissa McCarthy into her ""own sad type of acting-label"". She can act, still the industry and ""expactations"" pushes her again and again to the naive and juvenile... and Melissa is letting them having their way. It's almost tragic to see.The dialogue and the timing of the dialogue is one of the most lousy I have heard of in a very long time, especially since this is a high budget movie, block- and Ghostbuster movie (pun...pun...punny, yeah!). Therefore, I really bring it down as the production team, the writer, the director have worked a lot on the dialogue and the dialogue is very and utterly bad. The jokes is maybe for 10-15 year old they work... and then there is an big exclamation mark behind the word ""maybe"" in this same sentence...Just about 20 minutes, there is so many mistakes in the visual editing, the directing and the cutting of the movie that makes me think that this movie were made around 1996... and, no... here we are...correct... 2016.... oh, and...down the drain? Actually a good joke about 21 minutes into this one; ""no three bitches gonna catch a ghost"" and then similar song of original one in the background. Cool and fun.About 20 minutes and 20 seconds; personal reference to a joke a good friend of mine use to do; walking down the stairs behind the sofa. ""You know who you are""... same one as in ""Stranger Things"".29 minutes. Reference to ""there is something strange, in the neighbourhood..."" 35 minutes; the good original logo. Nice! Similarities all over the place from the two original movies. I am confused in why the business like to take the essence, small topics and the most known facts of the original movies (Robocop, Poltergeist etc) and put them like they're highlighted when they is just a part of the original ones. I think that they should treat them in the same way. Nowadays those parts makes the ""crown complete"" so to speak. Strange, I think.The first real good, big and loud laugh from me... 30 minutes and 25 seconds; Chris Hemsworth as Kevin. Ghostbusters: ""What have you been doing your whole life?"" Kevin: ""Well... I been trying out this acting thing...""Chris Hemsworth is the source of the most approved and some good jokes in the movie... I have to admit that. Gotten me two solid laughs 40 minutes into ""The busters""Nice little touch for the cast, implementing Dan Aykroyd, Bill Murray, Ozzy Osbourne, Andy Garcia, Ernie Gudson and Sigourney Weaver. Good to see 'em all. Some of them delivering memorable lines.Near the end; again, again, again... devastation, bombs, guns, ghosts... slime. Seems like every high budget movie has to have a moment of total destruction and explosion. For the money? For the youth? Maybe. Becoming boring. See ""Batman v Superman"", ""X-Men"", ""Independence Day: Resurgence""... try something fresh, will you?Over to the movie as a product: - The production : Well. Good American standard, with a lot of glitches and errors here and there, as mentioned above. - The actors : Cheezy. Prejudice. Probably a great failure coming from the director. Kate McKinnon (Holtzmann) is actually doing a good job in creating and maintaining a innovative role. - Entertainment : OH, YES... in 1984. - Age : 15, due to some cruelty and blood4,9 out of 10. (The final rate is based most on my own entertainment of the movie. Short elucidation of the rating: 5 Approved. 4 Failed. Lacking in character.)",Ghostbusters
229,pjgs200,An okay comedy with a good cast,6,29 March 2018,"I really don't get the 5.3 rating on here. Ghostbusters was pretty funny, even if the second half of the film wasn't as good as the first. Kristen Wiig was easily the best cast member, and she's really funny. Melissa McCarthy is also a very funny actress but I don't think she was given much to work with. Leslie Jones was also likable and genuine, while Kate McKinnon (who is early the best actor on SNL) was a bit too quirky for my liking. Chris Hemsworth was also pretty funny.I don't understand people who complain about a ""feminist agenda"" (as if that's a bad thing) or say that the film is sexist because the male characters were written as idiots. Did you miss the whole movie? Almost every character, male or female, is written as mindless and silly. That's the whole point of the film!Overall, Ghostbusters is a pretty good movie. The first half is laugh out loud funny, but the second half is disappointing with very little humor and overwhelming special effects. 6.5 out of 10.",Ghostbusters
230,rcolgan,Far Better Than The Trailer Made It Look,7,17 July 2016,"Even before it was released, this Ghostbusters reboot had already been the centre of great criticism, even becoming the most disliked trailer in the history of YouTube. But whilst it never feels like this reboot completely escapes the shadow of the 1984 original, Paul Feig's Ghostbusters has successfully defied it's poor trailer by building on the talents and personalities of its entire cast to create a fun, up-beat and all-round entertaining experience. It more or less follows most of the basic plot beats of the original film. After ghosts begin to pop up in New York, three scientists (Wiig, McCarthy and McKinnon) begin to investigate and along with a subway employee who witnessed the ghosts called Patty (Leslie Jones) they form a team to start fighting these ghosts. The only major difference is this time the ghosts are being lured in to our dimension by a man named Rowan who detests humanity and wants to destroy everyone. He's a villain so uninteresting and generic you'll forget about him as you're watching it. Fortunately the rest of the cast are all hilarious. They avoid falling in to the trap of being gender swapped versions of the original Ghostbusters cast and instead let their own comedic styles and personalities form unique dynamics between the new characters without relying on the 1984 original. Wiig plays Abby, a paranormal expert who loses her tenure due to her belief in the paranormal. She is the most restrained member of the cast whose best strength is playing off the other cast members. McCarthy also does well by moving away from her brash and outspoken performances in films like Tammy and Bridesmaids, instead playing a lovable upbeat scientist, in a role that gives her a good opportunity to show of her physical comedic skills. Leslie Jones is at her best when she's reacting to the strangeness of everything that's going on like running away from a mannequin that's come to life screaming at it to stop. Chris Hemsworth plays the dim-witted secretary, in what at first could have risked being a one note joke of role reversing the dumb blonde stereotype. But Hemsworth seems to elevate the source material with some great comedic delivery that makes him become a surprisingly likable mascot for the film. Though the real show stealer is definitely Kate McKinnon whose hyper-energetic style dominates the film whenever she's on screen. Even when she's not the focus she'll be in the background doing loads of visual gags. She's a weird mixture of an oddball personality and some great physical comedy to create one of the most charming and bizarre characters from any of Feig's films.The film is definitely at its strongest when Feig lets his own style takeover and focuses on letting the casts unique personalities and chemistries lead the film. Some of the films best moments are where the characters are just given an opportunity to hang out, like when McKinnon and Wiig are at their new headquarters and randomly burst out in to a small song and dance number that accidentally sets the place on fire. In contrast the films weakest moments tend to be when it tries to homage or throw in too many call-backs to the original film. At times these are hilarious with cameos from Akroyd and Slimer being some of the best moments of the film that are bound to appease both fans and newcomers alike. But at other times the filmmakers try so hard to show their love of the original film that they end up turning away from the fun personalities of the characters and instead stop the film dead in its track to directly quote lines like ""mass hysteria"" from the original film. They do references like this so often throughout that it ends up feeling like the film is unable to stand apart entirely from the 1984 original. Also Feig does seem somewhat limited when it comes to some of the films big action set pieces and seems uncomfortable working with the heavy amounts of CGI. This is particularly clear in the films finale where the film sways away from the actress's chemistry that made the film fun and replaces it with an extended fight sequence against generic looking ghosts that feels like it drags on for way too long.Though there are still some creative aspects to these sequences. It is cool to see all the different weapons that the Ghostbusters have including things like whips, pistols and grenades that are something genuinely different to what we saw from the original Ghostbusters. And the film as a whole is definitely a lot of fun to watch. Unfortunately it's not going to be good enough to win over people who go in to the film expecting to hate it, but for anyone hoping for a fun movie this will not disappoint.",Ghostbusters
231,stermix501,"bad, but not that bad",5,16 October 2016,"I was expecting a Ghostbusters movie for many years, but wasn't thrilled when I heard about this reversed gender reboot. There is nothing more sexist than reversing all classic macho/dude movies to mid-age housewives' representatives.I was dissuaded by the reviews from watching in theater, however I gave it a try at home.I believe that it was really watchable. The basic idea and scenario were apparently good, however the screenplay and particularly the dialogues had too many useless parts. Those were supposed to offer to actors the chance to develop their characters and make some jokes. However the result was to make the movie lose its pace and tire the viewer. 1h30 would have been more than enough to fully develop it. I guess they tried to imitate the 1st GB84 in that sense, but the cast had not the necessary talent.I was not offended like other reviewers by Hemsworth's role, that felt to me as more of a mocker, than completely stupid. Production design and special effects were adequate. The fighting gadgets were not a bad addition to the original story. The final confrontation was entirely satisfactory with Hemsworth's dance, many respectful winks to the original and GB symbol coming to life.Really the reviewers were too harsh, Some of them hadn't even watched the movie and got carried away from the hate of the firsts. We are in a time where the politically correct dictates a lot in this business. GB16 is to GB84 what StarWars7 is to StarWars1. Only better at it and with more respect to the fans, in the sense that there is no continuity between the two GBs and that it targets a more adult audience. If I could make a suggestion for the next one (whenever they decide to do it), is make a mixed gender team. Cast a couple of bad-asses actresses and let some men add the humorous side. Reinvent the whole team and avoid just finding replacements to the originals. Don't make the mistake Dukes of Hazzard's makers did when they replaced Bo and Luke by Coy and Vance",Ghostbusters

In all honesty this did not feel like a Ghostbusters film due to it lack of story , there were long scene where they just aren't doing anything & testing equipment instead of having scene like they did with the original film going out & capturing ghosts.Where the comedy? ..........Seriously i mean this is meant to be a comedy the joke were just awful this is the major problem this film had, with the original it was funny because the cast bounce off each other with banter, sadly with this casting just didn't work on screen. This casting might be funny on SNL show with short scene but trying to be funny through a whole film just wasn't the right casting , Kristen Wiig is a good actress but she just hasn't got that comedy in her because she more of a serious role actress & Kate McKinnon was seriously uncomfortable to watch it was like she was trying to force the comedy which made it even worst.(spoiler alert) There is a scene where the villain freezes everyone in what look like a dance scene like the mask but never happened thank god but this scene just felt so out of place wasn't necessary for the film, don't get me start on the scene after with the main villain , the film already lost me attention half way through but that scene just killed the film straight way , because it was like something out of a bad who framed roger rabbit scene.Although some scene with the C.G.I were pretty well done, there are moments with seriously bad green scene effects that just look awful on the screen making seriously obvious that it was green scene that complete lost the shoot of the scene realism. The film as whole felt more like a bad cartoon turn to a poorly made film , because the villain at the end as a seriously rip off of the original stay puff just a more creeper version , it just poorly written with a poor concept story that could have been done better, because i mean the film is meant to be about capturing ghost yet the scene in the new York square contradicts everything the film is meant to be portraying which a bad mistake for the film.All i can say to Sony is don't allow Paul Feig to direct another Ghostbusters film ever again, because this was a very lazy poor attempt at revamp the franchise.4 out of 10",Ghostbusters

At one point the daughter asked her dad if she could be a ghostbuster for Halloween, that matters. Holtzmann was bad ass and cool and funny. The only reason this movie doesn't get a 10 is because I did feel like some of the jokes they gave Leslie Jones were a little too tropey for me. This film had everything I wanted though, it made the source material relevant as seen in the new comics from IDW (which sold out 5 print runs), it targets more than just adult males and succeeds, it's funny, and the action was just awesome.

239,goolizap,Twizard Rating: 88,9,21 July 2016,"I'm not blindly biased about the original Ghostbusters as many other lifelong fans tend to be. And I'm also not afraid to admit that I like Ghostbusters II better than the first.With that said, this new Ghostbusters may not have the originality and importance of the original, but it definitely has the entertainment value.The new quartet of ghost-fighters is made up of Kristen Wiig, Melissa McCarthy, Kate McKinnon, and Leslie Jones. As a reboot to an all-new series, the story shows how they come together and rise to fame amidst backlash from the government and other naysayers.The looming--and probably inadvertent--Cold War undertones of the original get substituted for nothing in this one. And honestly, it's better that way. We have enough social commentary in our superhero movies these days that we don't need it all the time. Sometimes it's good to have a movie that can just be fun.And that's what this film is. In many ways, this one is funnier. Whereas the the original found comedy from pretty much just Bill Murray and Rick Moranis, this one tries squeezing it out of its entire cast. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't.It mostly doesn't work in the case of McKinnon and Jones. While Jones' comedy style doesn't fit well in most places, McKinnon's just doesn't fit well in this scenario. Wiig will say or do something funny and then McKinnon pipes in and it awkwardly falls flat. It's jarring. It's not just that the audience doesn't expect it--the audience doesn't want it. I think Kate McKinnon is funny, and I love the brand of humor she brings to this movie. But it just doesn't work here.There are few that may appreciate the cringe humor of McKinnon, but to most others, they just won't get it. Which isn't really what you want in a very mainstream reboot of one of the most popular comedies of all time.Chris Hemsworth is the brightest ray of sunshine in this film, as he plays the earnestly stupid receptionist who goes as far as proposing the 7-Eleven graphic as the logo for the Ghostbusters team.The script has some pacing issues, but a lot of the jokes are well-written and thought-out. Imagine if the ones that fell flat didn't. Director Paul Feig does a good job not just handing McCarthy the reins and letting her run off with it recklessly. Fortunately, she's contained enough that it doesn't just feel like her movie where she's stepping on everybody's toes. In fact, no one really does.There are enough solid references to the original film to keep old fans into it. There's that connection. It never feels like a distant cousin of Ghostbusters, but like it could, possibly, still be in that same universe.It's obviously not as much of a zeitgeist of an era as the original Ghostbusters was. No one ever expected it to be. In fact, no one really expected anything (with the exception of those fanboys who just hated its existence). And that plays in its favor as we can just sit back and be entertained, for all that it's worth.Twizard Rating: 88",Ghostbusters

But all that aside, what we have here is a needless retread of the original film, with a pretty much identical plot, but none of the charm or subtle humour that made the original so great. The gags aren't funny, there are hardly any new ideas brought to the table and I think throughout the entire thing I laughed twice. Maybe. Even the special effects are not that much better than the original, and considering the original is 34 years old that's saying something.

Seeing normal women doing cool things is just what the doctor ordered for someone trying to raise a confident, self-assured girl in the current day. My daughter thought the movie was fantastic. First thing she said as it ended was ""when can we buy it on Blu-Ray?""I thought the 4 leads had a decent chemistry. Kate Mckinnon is the standout, stealing most scenes that she is in with her mugging-style that she has perfected on SNL.I also felt like this was one of the better examples of 3D visual effects that I have seen. There are multiple scenes where the ghosts seem to come right out at you which are very effective.Finally: Who knew that Chris Hemsworth could be so funny? His jock- ish, jerkish nimrod of a secretary is actually quite endearing.Is it a great movie in-line with the original? No. This is not a classic by any means. I think the original relied so much on the comedic timing and brilliance of Bill Murray, and no one in this cast can match that. However, i don't think it is an awful film. It serves as a decent origin story and a solid girl-power effort that is not as disparaging to the male species as some people claim. I would go see a sequel.",Ghostbusters

245,refordgarry,A tale of One Half,6,28 July 2016,"I give the first half of Ghost(ball)busters a ""6 Point 3"", and want to, charitably end it there. As far as feminism goes anyone is entitled to laugh and sympathize with in-context gags, provided they don't attack basic core values. The movie, Ghost(ball)busters worked for me very nicely, even entertainingly, right up to the half-way point when Melissa, (played by Abby Yates) unwisely accepted the scripted direction to gratuitously break the new-wave musician's guitar on stage. I like Punk. Punk is Lefty Music, as are most of the performing Arts. Other Art-forms such as Rap have been known to openly expound misogyny, but it seems the movie studio and cast pussy-footed on that opportunity, despite its feminist writ. Is that because Punk is predominantly White music or did they feel that breaking, for example a Rap Artist's guitar, (whose music it could be argued would have exasperated a ghost even more) would have incurred wrath from some quarter? Ghost(ball)busters, rightfully deserved a thumbs-up until the Punk desecration scene, after this taking a decided turn for the worse. The reason, apart from the moral sell-out was purely due to the movie running out of steam. It is sad to reflect this remake had previously ticked all the right boxes, and, very importantly made the viewer eager to see more. The second half, to put it bluntly was a descending airplane. The plot that substituted those punch-drunk, stupid, zany guys of the first production for capable, all-too-clever-yet-downtrodden women, did evoke empathy. Girls, it seems have a problem with looking too dumb. Perhaps they do not feel sufficiently empowered? Even the awkward-misandry-driven part of Kevin, the useless, handsome, much maligned, English-accented, male secretary did little to pique, probably because many have also worked alongside somebody like ""him"". The second half of Ghost-ball-busters was, however a lamentable bore, trying to recapture, at times too literally the props, shots. tension and fantastically phased melodrama of the original Ghostbusters. Who cares about completely corny scripts, riotous bad acting, miscasting, soupy special effects - you name it? Despite the whopping 144 million-buck-price-tag the 2016 version of Ghostbusters was almost doomed to come a poor second. Even I, as artistic adviser could have straightened out many of these gaffs that could so easily have been averted. I hope, nonetheless the investors get back half their money, tax write-offs not included. People need to be bold with new ideas for new, upcoming productions. This particular movie was way, way too expensive and did so without achieving what the first, low-budget one did.",Ghostbusters
246,Brevin_Campbell,Ghostbusters is just OK. Not bad or good just well..OK,5,26 November 2016,There has been so much unneeded hate around this movie. People are raging out and yelling about how bad it is and how dare they take away my Ghostbusters cause they love it soo stupidly much. But with so much hate comes a lot of curiosity as well. I had to see the film and see how good or bad it really was. And after seeing it. It is well..neither. It has some good stuff in it. Like for instance I really liked Leslie Jones as Patty and Kristen Wiig as well. But then there was Melissa McCarthy whose character I really did not like and was really two dimensional and boring as well. I think the choice to make this a straight comedy was a really bad decision. A lot of the jokes fall flat on there face and they hurt really badly. Paul Feig has made some good movies before but this isn't really one of them. The man struggles to find good direction in a muddle of air and it just sadly doesn't live up to what could of been a really decent film.,Ghostbusters
247,trnjamesbond,Campy Cartoon Mess,1,22 July 2016,"Well let's see, we have four ladies that are into paranormal investigation, either on purpose or by accident. They come off in the beginning of the film somewhat intelligent. Kristen Wiig plays a women that is trying to work her way into a tenure but things go awry when her old pall Abby starts to sell a book that is about paranormal investigation that they wrote together and things don't look so good for Kristen Wiig's character Erin Gilbert. They eventually meet up because of this book situation that Erin wants to sweep under the rug, so that she get's her tenure, and doesn't want to be embarrassed in front of her bosses. This is how we are introduced to Abby(Melissa McCarthy) and Jillian Holtzman(Kate McKinnon). After getting some information from Erin, about a haunted mansion, Abby and Jillian jump at the chance to capture a ghost on camera. The trio then witness a real ghost and then decide to go into business for themselves, and we eventually meet Patty Tolan(Leslie Jones). Once their business is set up they hire a guy named Kevin(Chris Hemsworth) to work the phones. So to sum things up, this film is nothing like the original, the humour is in your face, which makes it not humorous at all, Kate McKinnon's character is a little too weak and just nutty for my tastes, she becomes highly annoying trying to play the role of a quirky mad scientist. She seems to have this goofy grin on her face most of the time. Melissa McCarthy is shouting through the whole film, and Leslie Jones, plays a very witty but just a bland stereotype of a cliché character, I'm not saying, cliché in a racial sense.(like the press makes you believe) I mean cliché as the group's sidekick type of character, the comic relieve if you will. Kevin played by Chris Hemsworth, is a below intelligence moron who no one in real life would hire, but as far as the story goes he's also a web designer, which makes no sense as to why this person is such a dullard, is the director Paul Feig saying that all web designers are complete bumbling morons? Your guess is as good as mine. Now the villain, Rowan North(Neil Casey) is a below par villain if you ask me. He is a troubled person that gets bullied, so to get back at everyone he builds a machine to unleash the ghost's of the netherworld(so to speak). Then he becomes a ghost himself by purposely electrocuting himself, then later possesses the body of Kevin(Chris Hemsworth).The Gadgets. Well they looked really terrible we also see a new version of the PKE Meter that Harold Ramis used in the 1984 film, has been reintroduced as a hand held spinning glow stick. Yes you read that right ""glow stick"". Which brings me to another point, the ghosts. The apparitions in this film were something out of a cartoon, and we actually see a cartoon ghost in this film. They seem like something from Disney's Haunted Mansion. They were way too colorful, and just came off as cheap and campy. Another thing I want to mention, if you fell for the negative radical feminist views like I did, those people in my opinion were dead wrong, the film is not propaganda for radical feminism, in fact the female cast all but one, actually make women look more stupid, and unintelligent, Kristen Wiig's role was the only form of intelligence in this film. Kate McKinnon's role made her look like a retarded physicist of some sort. You will understand when and if you waste your time on this film. I just don't see how this film makes women look smart and tough at all, they run around like a bunch of bumbling idiots. Final verdict, this gets a 1 out of 10 for me. The main plot of the villain was moot, and just not worth watching, the film seemed cheap and campy in all aspects, and does not hold up to the 1984 classic. Do yourself a favour and go by a Blu-ray copy of the original, and save yourself some money by not going to the box office. I predict when this version of Ghostbusters gets released on to disc it will be in the junk bin at your local Walmart, like all the other garbage films that Hollywood is remaking these days.",Ghostbusters
248,sjarja,Luke warm at best...,5,22 November 2016,"This movie is not as terrible as some state it to be in my opinion. It is however FAR from good.I was squirming in my seat at the cringe worthy humor every now and then and got bored by what seemed to be terrible pacing. I have not seen the original Ghostbusters other than some snippets of them on YouTube - but from what i have seen from the originals - the humor was more spot on.The acting is average - i never felt like any of the actors put up a particularly good performance - but then... the script hardly called for outstanding acting. It called more for overacting (kind of like acting in a sketch, which is often overacted and louder than a ""normal"" scene) I did not get the Chris Hemsworth role. He seemed kind of wasted. If he was only in the movie for eye candy, he certainly didn't't do a good enough role, cause he came across like a moron. (yes, being stupid affects my perception of attractiveness/eye candy) The effects were on the level of the Star Wars prequels. They looked aged. I would have preferred them to go the full mile to look cheesy as 80s effects at least.All in all - the movie was forgettable. I do not mind watching it - but i do not think i ll have the urge to re-watch it in a video night or similar in the future.",Ghostbusters

250,Field78,Fanboys be damned: open your mind and this remake will leave you in good spirits!,7,22 July 2016,"People flooding the social media with hatred for a movie before even a script has been written is nothing new. But when they start writing bad reviews for a movie they admittedly haven't seen (because they're convinced it will suck anyway), you know that there's something strange in the neighborhood. Yes people, this is, as often, a clear case of 'hating on principle'. The many one-star reviews (162 at last count) are the main cause of the current 5.3 rating. But as I have observed over and over, that is rarely the whole story. So I did a check, and for a movie that is supposed to be so bad that you don't even need to see it to know it, I currently counted 519 good reviews against 288 bad. There you have it: 2/3 of the people who took the time to comment were positive. And you can add mine to it.Let me say first that I have seen all of Paul Feig's theatrical movies, and I really think he has surpassed Judd Apatow when it comes to laughs. Together with the fabulous Melissa McCarthy and Kirsten Wiig, he has broken that old misconception that women can't be funny. I laughed so hard at 'Spy' that when I heard Feig and McCarthy were going to do a Ghostbusters remake, my thought was that if someone could pull it off, it would be them. Of course I love the old classic version, and did not think it was in immediate need of being redone; that said, the 1984 version was also made by a director/comedian team at the top of their game, so who says that a new team couldn't bring a fresh, new and modern perspective to it? And I have to say: they pulled it off. Just like the reboots of Evil Dead, Dawn of the Dead, Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Star Trek, this isn't a lazy retread of the original with merely some updated special effects, but a new origin story with familiar elements. Feig and screenwriter Katie Dippold must have felt the close scrutiny they were under, so they purposely tried to avoid getting too close to the original, both in terms of plotting and classic scenes. It's funny to see how they keep steering towards familiar elements, and then make an unexpected turn. And where they could not avoid it, they get a nice joke or tongue-in-cheek reference out of it (just check the cameos of the original cast, and the post-credit scene!). Some sequels/reboots get overly smug with all their winks to the original (or ""hommages"" as they call it), but here, it never becomes annoyingly conspicuous.That said, the original once won us over by its daring combination of an original premise, special effects and good humor. The reboot lacks a new premise, so it has to score on other areas. And it is there where the criticism comes is. Paul Feig usually creates a self-invented universe where he can unleash all sorts of appropriate jokes, but here he borrows from a previously established world, and that freshness is hard to copy. These confinements somewhat limit his inspiration for comedy, with the result that there are noticeably fewer laughs this time around, despite several very good ones (often the self-referential ones). Kirsten Wiig seems to be quite intimidated by the daunting task of filling Bill Murray's shoes in the beginning, and Melissa McCarthy, funny as always, isn't in her best shape. But maybe they held back to give the other two leads some time to shine. Leslie Jones is very funny as the assertive Patty, who has her street smarts to compensate for her lack of science, but Kate McKinnon as 'Holtz' is the unsung heroine in the movie for me. With her cool-headed attitude and general not-entirely-stable demeanor, she could be the female Zach Galifianakis. And it is refreshing to see tough guy Chris 'Thor' Hemsworth as the dumb blond/love interest for a change, even though this has led to some ridiculous accusations of man-hatred among reviewers. A strange criticism for a movie that intentionally tries to reverse the typical gender roles. Well, I think we men have the right to play the sort of negative stereotype that women were sentenced to for ages! As can be expected, the special effects look top-notch. The makers have taken the opportunity to expand the inventory of the Ghostbusters with some really cool gadgets, giving the female leads the opportunity to show what they are worth. The ghosts all look quite convincing, and especially the climax, traditionally the most spectacular sequence in a Ghostbuster movie, is impressive, and even has a pretty original adversary. But at the heart of the movie is still the chemistry between these four characters, which isn't changed by the fact that they are women now. If people give this movie only one star and they can clearly motivate why, I say ""bless 'em"". But hating this movie on the basis that it shouldn't exist is not something I shall be participating in. Whether you regard it as remake, reboot or sacrilege, I thoroughly enjoyed it for what it is: not as good as the 1984 version, but a bit better than Ghostbusters II. Or to use a phrase a friend of mine often coins: it is far better than it has the right to be.",Ghostbusters

254,Gambitt,Strong start; flat ending; good for some chuckles,6,23 December 2016,"Ghostbusters is a moderately amusing action comedy, starring Kristen Wiig, Melissa McCarthy, Kate McKinnon, and Leslie Jones as an all- female team of haunter huntresses.How much you enjoy the movie (assuming you can get over any predispositions) depends mostly on whether you like Director Paul Feig's style and writing. I personally like the cheeky sense of humor intermixed with gags and visual humor.Having said that, the movie becomes a bit too heavily dependent on slapstick towards the end, and forgettable CGI action sequences do little to enhance the experience. Which is a shame, because the introduction and build up of the team is pretty well done.All in all, Ghostbusters is not going to win any awards or birth a beloved new franchise.

No. Spoiler, this is a cash-grab reboot, pure and simple. The actresses do their best, but there's no compensating for just bad writing. The comedy comes off as several bad Saturday Night Live skits rather than the circumstantial, organic comedy found in the original. Overall, the movie wasn't that bad. It was something worse.

257,SPaS,SNL cast turns a beloved franchise into an overlong SNL sketch,4,22 July 2016,"First off: THE BUZZ IS REAL - this movie is a dud.I took my 13yo son to see this on the opening night. We both had seen the trailers, hated them, and had lowered our expectations accordingly - mine was at about IMDb 5. Of course you could ask why we bothered at all to see the movie if we had doubts. Well, in short - because we love the original and were desperate to like this one too. On the positive side I must say the new Ghostbusters started off alright and the first 30 mins or so showed genuine promise: the ""comedic"" scenes didn't drag as bad as they seemed in the trailers (might have been trimmed after backlash) and the scary scenes were undeniably scary. However, after a kind-of- promising start the movie started to edge the ""horror"" out of the ""horror comedy"" in favor of your typical Wiig/McCarthy humour. And as the movie progressed also the jokes started to lose steam because they followed the same formula. You know: deadpan comment on event or situation - deadpan response - deadpan response (repeat) - and then cut to action. Basically the last half of the movie I was checking my watch and waiting for another gratuituos cameo, or for it all to just end.Sony, do the smart thing and instead sequel, hit reboot. It's just like with the ""Hulk"" - movies: do them until you get them right. The world didn't need a sequel for a ""Spiderman"" starring Andrew Garfield.

There has been a lot of controversy surrounding this film, mostly from internet hacks who were clinging to the sexist chant that ""women aren't funny."" Ghostbusters is clever and funny, features cool special effects, but is admittedly a little clichéd. That being said this film is very good, and I would say don't let the audience reviews online sway your opinion too much.For those who don't know anything about the Ghostbusters reboot, it's being made by the same people that made Bridesmaids. Bridesmaids is one of the funnier recent comedies, but i'll go so far as to say I enjoyed Ghostbusters more. While Melissa McCarthy and Kristen Wiig are their reliable selves, the show stealers for me were Kate McKinnon, Leslie Jones, and Chris Hemsworth. All 3 brought an unexpected level of humor and screen presence, and almost every joke delivered by Leslie Jones had me laughing out loud. Leslie Jones and Kate McKinnon may have entered this film as almost exclusively SNL stars, but after this film I think you'll see them in a lot more.The rebooted Ghostbusters, much like the original, uses a lot of special effects, in an attempt to mix big budget CGI with comedy. The original Ghostbusters, sort of broke ground by proving that comedy and big budget special effects could work together, nowadays it's commonplace as every Marvel movie uses the same approach. That being said the effects in this movie, especially the sound design, were cool and looked good. I will say that some of the effects reminded me of Star Wars, but they aren't the first and they won't be the last to copy that movie.The only big problem I had with the movie was that it felt somewhat derivative. Many moments in the movie it felt like they were nodding to the original instead of trying to be different. That along with the reliance of Paul Fieg on the overly talkative humor, where characters refuse to ever let the audience figure a joke out for themselves, are really the only things that seemed weak in the film. That being said major fans of actions films should beware that the action sequences are nothing special, and some characters aren't all that well developed.So in essence Ghostbusters is no masterpiece, it's really not even a great movie, but it is pretty entertaining. The cast is great in the movie, many of the jokes worked, the effects were cool, the soundtrack was nostalgic fun, and the movie even featured cameos from the entire cast of the original, that are still with us. For those who feel weary because the online fan reviews and ratings have been bad, I fear many of those reviewers never saw the movie, and instead gave the movie a bad rating out of hatred that women are in a traditionally male movie. This is a fairly entertaining comedy, and regardless of what you've heard if you like comedies check this movie out.",Ghostbusters
259,thisseatofmars,Improves over the originals.,1,6 November 2016,"At one point of the movie, one of the central cast reads an Internet comment, saying, ""Ain't no bitches gonna hunt no ghosts."" This is a direct nod to the controversy around this Ghostbusters reboot and its all female cast. But these girls do hunt ghosts, and they do it well.Kristen Wig is funny, and so is Melissa McCarthy. Usually McCarthy plays butch or gross caricatures of dumpy women, but here she's an enthusiastic scientist, which is charming to see. An assortment of celebrity cameos crop up all throughout the runtime: I recognized Ed Begley Jr. and Michael McDonald from other comedies, but it was a treat seeing the inimitable Charles Dance gracing the screen, while the over celebrated Bill Murray has an extended cameo.But actors aside, Ghostbusters 2016 is funny. Literally laugh out loud funny, which is rare for most comedies these days. What spoils the fun however is when the cast goes off script. They throw in improvised lines which are unfunny and go nowhere. And they're stupid. Here's an example: ""That book was our baby and you threw it out before it could even fly. / Babies can't fly. / You... you uh, don't know that. If I had a baby that could fly I, uh... I wouldn't uh, tell anybody.""Hilarious. And by hilarious, I mean dumb as nails, and nowhere near as strong as the prepared jokes. Ghostbusters is not Whose Line Is It Anyway or a podcast. If we wanted off the cuff banter we wouldn't watch a Hollywood production. Despite these instances, Ghostbusters 2016 is funnier than the originals. Yes, I said it. The majority of Ghostbuster fans are men in their 30s whose nostalgia for childhood and the crap they enjoyed as kids is more precious to them than, say, religion. I've met these guys and have seen them online: they'll joke about every religion and political event, but if someone insults Ghostbusters or Star Wars: HOLY LORD! You'll never see someone become more defensive, angry, and outraged outside of a fundamentalist (and you'd be surprised by how much fundamentalists and pop culture junkies have in common.)So, knowing that the Ghostbusters install fanbase are loser men, why was a reboot released with an all female cast? All it would do is upset the incumbents: the same people who define themselves by their tastes and praise The Force Awakens solely because it's so reverential to the original SW movies. The fact is (and prepare to feel old) the first Ghostbusters movie came out in 1984, over 30 years ago. Time to grow up and be men. Nostalgia is never set in stone, and change is nature's delight.",Ghostbusters

261,feyipuk,A script that's deader than the bad guys,3,15 December 2016,"You've spent decades working on paranormal activity, wrote a book and distanced yourself from it because people called you crazy because of it, only to not only to team up with people who have the technology to prove that your theories are right but can actually catch something that proves you're right, such that you end up sat in the Mayors office, and rather than talking about all the things you've done, you're discussing with your friend if you can put cats back in bags!The script just lacked the pace that might be expected given the dead are coming back to life.
I hadn't heard what the actual plot was before - basically, someone tries to open a portal to the other side, so who you gonna call - but what had a decent premise just fell flat. Like so many other remakes, where the writers have watched the original and reimagined their own story, it just felt like lots of long skits and set pieces.
The big baddie (available in all toy shops) is just the ghost from their logo.
The special effects are smoke and fireballs, with the proton packs switching between trapping ghosts and annihilation of anything deceased.
And I kinda felt sorry for the original Ghostbusters who show up in cameos (including Slimer, Stay Puft and the fire station). They didn't want to link the story to the original films, yet included most of the original cast in bit parts (I missed Sigourney Weaver; supposedly she's in the credits), only serving to remind people about the originals. Even Harold Ramis has a bust at Colombia University!
They had a scene in the 1984 version that took place in the Mayors office as well, but then there was a bit more pace and tension.Chris Hemsworth has been written as dumb to the point of lunacy (and there's probably some deeper meaning about looks vs brains), but he has the best joke in the movie, and it was totally improvised; they removed the glass in his glasses because of the reflection into the camera, and he rubs his eye. I can't say I remember much about the rest of the cast, but at least Melissa Mccarthy doesn't have to any running followed by being out of breath in this film.
The film's probably made a pile of cash in merchandise as people make their own Ghostbusting stories up, which is probably more fun than watching the film.",Ghostbusters
262,dogma-53668,This Ghostbusters version is just plain fun,10,4 June 2021,I don't why all the hate this Ghostbusters version is very much a blast and I enjoyed it a bunch. It may not be a classic like the first one but it's definitely better than Ghostbusters 2. The comedians are all top-notch and the jokes are funny. Special effects are good too. No need to compare it...It's a separate entity just enjoy the film. Just pretend it's an alternate universe. Popcorn optional.,Ghostbusters
263,SpoodermanDerp,"Downvote this all you like, I don't care, It was surprisingly good.",7,15 July 2016,"Ghostbusters (2016) is obviously a reboot and you know that, and that's probably why you've already condemned this film at the start. It also might be because of the horrid marketing and unfunny jokes. There is not really much to say about the build up to this film that you probably already know but here's something you will never know now that you've limited yourself in your close mindedness, this film is actually pretty surprisingly good. ""Why is it so good then? I obviously don't see how it's going to be good in any way and it's just a cash grab without even seeing it."" Well let me give you a treat. It's enjoyable as any other comedy film you'd see, it's a joy to see different spins and variety other than being another cookie-cutter shot for shot remake of the original film, it's filled with a peachy cast that has chemistry that maybe isn't on par with the original cast but at the same time they have their own strengths and specialty, and lastly (your favorite part) it's not as good as the original and still has some flaws that people will pick apart. There are lots of chuckle moments in the film and they're done pretty well enough. Of course some jokes are either a hit or miss, but maybe the weirdest part about the jokes are not everyone will get them since they're quite subtle or reference to something greater and if you like that kind of comedy then you'll find yourself laughing throughout the film but not everyone in the theater will be laughing with you though (lol). The jokes or sequences in the film that didn't work or just was downright unfunny in the trailers and marketing worked so unexpectedly well in the film. Maybe it's because these jokes and sequences worked better given the context of the film and the whole thing and Paul Feig (like the British guy he is) just doesn't know how to do one-liners or jokes (like what Americans do) that just hold on their own (see the difference between American and British comedy). The new cast is....surprisingly delightful, they have this chemistry that works with them when they're together, however if they're not together and you have individual scenes or sequences with them, they aren't as interesting and they're a bit dull at certain points except for of course a few exceptions. KATE MCKINNON, was absolutely the best part about the film and is the total exception, the scenes alone with her, plus the scenes with her interacting with the group were all quirky and outlandish. Chris Hemsworth is also a standout in the film as you may have probably guessed and he plays the idiot which may turn some people off but the film handled him pretty accordingly and all his scenes were appreciable at best. He totally gives the most laughs and that means the film does do something special with such a stereotypical idiot character so I can't really complain here. Is it faithful to the original? Well firstly this should've even be a category in a review since it's only fitting to have this film stand on it's own objectively given how much variety and twists to the original film this one made, so I won't bother with this and just talk to you about the cameos and references. The cameos and references were more or less (like the jokes) a hit or miss, some felt forced, some are just downright surprising, and some were just there for the sake of being there, but the film doesn't tangle itself up to go completely halting the film just for the sake of intertextuality. The visual effects for me are (and this will be an unpopular choice but bear with me) unique, stylish and vivid that's just like how it is in cartoons which is going to obviously going to be appalling for some people. There's a lot to like with how colorful and vibrant each design for the ghosts are however when in action with the Ghostbusters, they WILL look off for some people, but some will not mind.So what's so horrible about this film? Well for starters, lots of people will complain about how the villain has no depth and his motivations were rushed for the sake of developing the Ghostbusters more, which I would most probably agree with as well but I thought he was serviceable enough because it felt like there was nothing else more to know about him other than what the film gave us. Like I said, there are a lot of things that are either a hit or miss in this film, the jokes, the subtle nods, and the characters will all be judged accordingly by you and it may be a good thing or a bad thing. The pacing for this film actually drags at the start and doesn't get to the point real quick. There would be scenes wherein they talk for an abnormal amount of time without establishing something important and then something integral to the plot appears 3 minutes later. The final third act is also pretty reminiscent of the original and it's going to be generic for some people which can be bothering. BUT THE BIGGEST FLAW this film did is create such an enormous backlash and hate from people thus creating preconceived notions. Try and going into this film with an open minded, I saw it with 7 people, 2 of which haven't seen the original and they all enjoyed it and was thoroughly surprised. This film will only being good will only depend on you, so cheers and have fun with it :)Verdict: 7.6/10",Ghostbusters
264,williamsonandcompany,Entertaining movie but nothing like the first two,6,13 August 2018,The movie was pretty good in the beginning but failed to keep you interested middle to the end. Think Hollywood so caught up in to making an all female cast work that they didn't give them a polished script. I don't blame the actors but the reason why the first two worked is because the cast improvised more. The story plot however I thought was good just wished they kept it more exciting to watch. Doubt there will be a second one made after these results.,Ghostbusters

As the genre suggested there was not much of action, fantasy not very much but there is a lot to laugh. Some notable acting in this movie would be of Kristen, Mellissa, Kate, Leslie, Karan and Chris Hemsworth. The plot could have been made better I felt it was dragged in many places especially towards the end of the movie. The ending was predictable and I did not like it. I think there is going to be a sequel for this movie they have to make sure they have a good plot and proceed in making the sequel. Yes I would recommend people to watch this movie just for the laughs.My Rating 6/10",Ghostbusters
266,AmyJenson1995,How to trash a fantastic saga in ten lessons,1,1 April 2017,"When the trailer of this thing was released, I knew it was to be a truly bad movie. I didn't go to the theater nor buy or rent to watch this travesty. Instead I've decided to watch it for free and I'm so glad I didn't spend any dime on this trash!As a woman and great fan of the original films, I feel trashed to see that Ghostbusters has been torn to pieces just to push Paul Feig and Sony CEO's flawed feminist agenda for everyone to see. How could they dare to do that to the millions Ghostbusters fans who grew up watching Peter Venkman, Ray Stanz,Egon Spengler and Winston Zeddemore busting ghosts in a very delightful,funny and inspired way? Shame on them! They should never be in charge of a movie again and despised by the film industry for the rest of their lives!Now let's get to the bottom of it and show you how to destruct an amazing legacy and blow it into oblivion shall we? 1) Get rid of the funny and inspirational tone of the original movie. Instead fill it with flat-lined jokes which would make everyone telling them embarrassed to have even open his/her mouth.2)Make the Ghostbusters pass for a bunch of frauds by the whole city of New York and shamelessly make them feel okay about it. I should remind you, Paul, that the TRUE ghostbusters, the ones we love and will always consider as the ones and only, were REVERED and celebrated. But as I suspect you never watched the movies, I guess you never had a clue!3) Associate the original cast to this disaster through pointless cameos just to bury them down a little more. A nice way to tell the world how a bunch of class acts Paul and his SJW friends at Sony truly are!4) Add some superfluous gadgets and weapons which are doing nothing but taking off the magic of the general story frame. Peter, Ray, Egon and Winston were just scientists doing their jobs with their own talent and guts. Here we have a team of super soldiers taking out ghosts with grenades and dual weapons. PLEASE!5) Make this movie a display for pushing your agenda even it's terribly flawed. As a woman, my take on Feminism was to prove the males that we can be as able as them in their fields of expertise. It was never about making men looking like stupid and useless jerks and make women looking like Rambos. And my hat is off for the ending: Shooting Rowan in the crotch to take him down. That's classy!6) Add a lame and pretty dull soundtrack to the overall, throwing away the little magic left in the tank. I'm pretty sure a lot of us fans would have loved to hear the original theme rather than this mix of techno, rap and pop you put on.7) The fact that they have all they need to catch the ghosts but they lack a containment unit. What are they supposed to do? Dump the ghosts in the Hudson river?8) Hire a cast which is as lame as the script. My special mention to Leslie Jones who is truly annoying in this film. So her only asset to get into a team is because she can get a car from her uncle in the hood? Yeah sure maybe she could fund the team with some cash from some business made aside as well hmmm??9) Make Ecto-1 losing all its charm with that ugly big yellow light coming right from the 70s and remove the so familiar siren to replace it by a completely inaudible one. For once I was glad you destroyed it at the end of the movie.10) And finally my biggest point: Show the utmost disrespect for the entire fan community by constantly denying our remarks and branding us as misogynists when we only wanted to make this movie better. You have to understand that many of us were waiting for this third installment to come along. All we wished it was to be the greatest possible. But instead you saw us as the sheep who would just go see this pile of garbage because of the Title. Well I didn't and I'm very glad you didn't receive any dime from me. And I'd like to say you should be pretty ashamed to bring your herd of trolls to give great reviews and shut us down once again just to give yourself some good publicity you TRULY don't deserve.On that, HAVE A NICE DAY like we say in New York.",Ghostbusters

268,movieman89-2,Awful..just awful,1,20 July 2016,"Ghostbusters was a huge obsession of mine as a child. I collected the toys, had the two films recorded from TV, and then bought them both on VHS and now have them on Blu Ray. Now at the age of 26, I still feel the same about them as I did then. Seeing the trailers for this one, I was not in the least bit impressed (probably like everyone else). But I thought I should go and see it to actually gain an opinion and say that I've seen it. Let me just say first off....I could not wait for the end credits to role.It had a solid story, yes but it had so many plot holes including rehashes and references from the first film. With no dark element involved like in the first two. Some of the ghosts, I have to say, looked pretty decent but they didn't have the scare factor. They just felt too playful and colourful. For the main villain, there was no investment whatsoever. When he showed up, he didn't have a threatening tone. I felt he overacted and was too cartoonish.For the cast, it was well acted and it looked like they had a blast in the production of the film, but it was ruined by the atrocious writing. With the originals, there was scientific talk backed up with dialogue that all audiences can understand. With this, the scientific dialogue was dragged out and just felt that it was unnecessary. I really do like Paul Feig as a director and I really enjoyed his other films. However, due to the writing, the direction was terrible. There were just times where I wanted to shout at the screen ""No-one would do or say that"". For example, during a scene involving a heavy metal concert, there was a demonic ghost, causing mayhem. What did everyone do? Stand there doing nothing. Also when one of the ghostbusters is being dragged off by the demon, people were taking selfies on their phones with it. Who would do that? and why didn't anyone run for the hills?For the comedy element, everything just felt forced and painfully awkward. Whereas in the originals, the comedy moments were off the cuff and downright hilarious, Well done to Mr Akroyd and Mr Ramis. However, the only funny moments were when the original cast made cameo appearances and insulted the new ghostbusters, either saying their fake or as Mr Akroyd put it ""I ain't afraid of no ghost"" (cheesy I know, but I laughed at that) That all just felt to me that they were saying ""Nah, we're the real ghostbusters""So overall, this film was just awful. I never had a problem that it was an all female team. It was just everything else failed miserably. I literally left the cinema with gritted teeth.I would highly recommend not to this film at the cinema. Watch it on Netflix by all means. But I would just stick with the originals. You'll also be avoiding the abysmal new theme song by Fall out Boy and Missy Elliott. It was always Ray Parker Jr's song.",Ghostbusters
269,A_Llama_Drama,"If you truly like the original, you'll like this one, too.",8,17 July 2016,"I've just returned from watching a film I was skeptical about. Having four women lead a film originally led by men gave me the impression I would be watching some trendy, PC, equal opportunities mess. Instead, Ghostbusters is a mess of fun, scares, truly unPC antics. A mad man has found a way to break the wall between the living and the dead. As he releases ghosts and ghouls on the unsuspecting people of Manhattan, it is up to a group of disgraced scientists and a lonely MTA worker to put a stop to it. Ghostbusters works because, rather than cast four women to play the exact same roles as the ones made famous by Dan Aykroyd, Bill Murray, Ernie Hudson and Harold Ramis, they are allowed to create their own chemistry and characters. They're all strong comedians and they're all given the chance to show off. The film doesn't feel like a retread of the old material, rather a hilarious, modern take on a hilarious, once modern spectacle. Of course, a lot of the original shock and awe is missing here because, as an audience, we know what to expect, but in the one of the films funniest scenes involving a mannequin and a rock concert, Feig and co prove they've got cause to be here.I was familiar with McCarthy and Wiig. Their work on Bridesmaids was stellar but I've found McCarthy's humour to be far too coarse (except in Spy) and I've not seen Wiig since. McKinnon and Jones are an added blast of crazy cool. As for the unPC nature, Chris Hemsworth is sexualised beyond belief. Playing dumb as a coot and as fit as Adonis, he shines and almost steals the show from the girls. Not to mention, one of the Ghostbuster's almost flagrant touching of him and you're amazed no one has called in social services. The film isn't man hating, it's not ""feminist"" propaganda. It's a movie that just so happens to have women kicking ass. The film is messy, though. Like the original, it's kind of all over the place. However, it's amusement more than makes up for it. Kristen Wiig running helter skelter down Manhattan telling people to evacuate whilst a possessed McCarthy rotates her head a la Exorcist elicited big laughs from the audience I saw it with. There were also moments of collective gasps. The 3D is some of the finest I've seen in film, yet. Although the ending is flat and runs out of steam before the final ghost has been apprehended, it still manages to find a source of entertainment.By far the most fun I've had at the cinema since Captain America, I'd give this 4/5.",Ghostbusters
270,Beard_Of_Serpico,This has already been swept under the rug.,2,13 November 2020,"The original Ghostbusters and it's sequel are really enjoyable classic action comedy movies with expertly crafted scripts full of memorable and quotable dialogue and dry, sarcastic humor. The way the characters speak and act makes them feel like real people who all have their own distinct personalities.
The effects are great and still look good (mostly) nowadays because they are mostly practical.The remake replaces all of that with a bare bones script full of wacky slapstick and people falling over. You can tell they just rolled the camera and let the actors improv and then edited the ""best"" bits together. It isn't funny and mostly consists of them being ""zany"" and awkward or screaming like banshees.
The effects are not terrible but it looks very cartoony like it was aimed at small children even though it clearly isn't.People dislike this movie not because the Ghostbusters are female but because it's a bad movie.

276,trevor-82944,Girls Just Wanna Have Some Ghostly Fun,2,15 July 2016,"What always appealed to me about the original 1984 hit was its unique sense of humor that never tries too hard. It's not quite imitated successfully with this remake of ​Ghostbusters, in fact it switches back and forth between trying too hard, not trying hard enough and hitting it just right. A majority of the humor between three of the four leads stems from intentional discomfort. Sometimes it works, and sometimes it just gets on my nerves. Overall, the humor is hit or miss, but there were moments that did genuinely make me smile. Just a word of caution though: there is one fart joke that falls flat in the first ten minutes, but just one, and it's thankfully not cringe worthy enough to hurt the rest of the film.So now let me get to the real matter at hand: the four women replacing the famous foursome.Kristen Wiig is the new Bill Murray of the team. She plays a psychology professor at Columbia University whose book about the paranormal has been published online by her co-author/ longtime friend without permission. Wiig plays her character's discomfort as calmly as possible, even while getting repeatedly puked on by ectoplasm. It's not the best role she's played, but it will pass. It's also worth noting that the conflict with the book publishing sparks the events leading to the team, yet it is never resolved or even mentioned again after the first act.She is for sure the one who stands out beside her old friend Melissa McCarthy, who plays the Dan Aykroyd of this team. She's alright when paired with Wiig, but stands for not much else besides playing off the others.Saturday Night Live performer Kate McKinnon is the Harold Ramis of the team, quiet but spunky with her gadgets. She is easily the most likable of the ladies.But then there's Leslie Jones, who plays the Ernie Hudson of the group. She's the African American subway guard who joins the team purely for comic relief and nothing more. Now, Jones certainly tries her hardest with the direction given, but she still appears overall offensive to Black women by the way she screams all her lines, as well as one piece of dialogue that states how Black women know the most about New York City. Well, that's certainly not a debatable statement at all, now is it?As much fun as the cast may seem to be having, the movie's reversal of gender roles in an attempt for social correctness is getting us absolutely nowhere. In fact, all the negative stereotypes are still very much here, just in a different way than we're expecting. Take a look at who Chris Hemsworth plays: he's cast as the eye candy that parallels the dumb-blonde secretary, with emphasis on the dumb part. He only got the job because the other ladies find him hot, and their interview with him consists purely of girly flirting. Now, Hemsworth is for sure the funniest character in the cast, but his shallowness still adds to how confused Ghostbusters is in terms of social correctness.What exactly did director Paul Feig (Bridesmaids, Spy, The Office) get right with his rehash of the classic? He still flings elements of mystery fun with the equipment testing and ghost hi-jinks in a rock concert. I can even forgive him for the awful special effects, because the feeling of cheesy hysteria still remains. But it's still difficult to recommend because of the lack of real tension behind anything that happens. It's not just because of the unresolved subplots, but because of the main villain's lack of any motivation to fill New York with ghosts. Seriously, it's never explained.Overall, Ghostbusters is not the worst thing ever, like the YouTube comments made it out to be, and it is still a satisfactory feature without the original, but I doubt any lasting satisfaction could land from this wild heap.",Ghostbusters
277,LLgoatJ,Poor film but does actually work with an all female cast.,4,8 March 2017,"This is not as bad as everyone makes out but is not that great a film. It does actually work with an all female cast. Unfortunately it appears they spent so much time congratulating themselves on making an all female film that they forget to make a decent film. Melissa McCarthy saves this film to the point that if she wasn't in it then despite being a Ghostbusters fan I probably wouldn't have finished watching it. She is really the only good thing in it. The acting is good and the cast do complement each other. Leslie Jones it feels like she was put in at the last minute and it would have been a slightly better film without her. Unfortunately though it is a poor film with a poorer script. If it had been an all men cast then there wouldn't have been a fuss and it would have barely registered any interest.

Actually the only interesting sequels are the comics from IDW. Check'em out.Now, TO THE MOVIE. Oh my God, what have I just watched? I mean, hell. Haunted Mansion/The Haunting Remake CGI, stupid fart&vomit jokes, following a script that just copies the main story of the original film. It's true that is incredibly bad. It's ""Bridesmaids in Ghostbusters costumes"" bad! Yes, I've watched all 3 hit films by McCarthy and I admit that I hated all of them.The only one interesting characters were Erin and a bit Patty. I hated Holtzmann and Abby was just plain ol'dull McCarthy. ""Thor"" was stupid and trying to be funny, and all men were stupid as well. Talking' about gender inequality...The only scene that I found interesting and a bit original, was the rescue of Abby in the grand finale. Absolutely nothing else. I ff'd almost the half movie and I'm glad I did. Painful puns, stupid cameos, awful story, unoriginal characters, lame CGI ghosts and many bad remixes of the theme are fully describing this train-wreck of non- awesomeness.Avoid it at all cost.

280,NDbportmanfan,"No Question, I Had Difficulties Watching This Movie But It Is Not That Bad",5,12 April 2017,"After watching this I came away with two major gripes that put this movie below the original 80's version. Let it be clear that I am also not a fan of the original by any means as I rated the first a 6/10 and never had the interest to even try the sequel. So the first big problem was all of the forced one liners throughout. There was simply too many and barely any of them fit the flow of the story. That is probably why the original was so well liked because they were able to blend comedy into a lite supernatural drama. I'm fine with the movie being a clear comedy as at times I did find myself laughing at some of the lines.The other gripe I had was the weak clichéd villain. You would think that a big brand movie like Ghostbusters would cast someone a little more well known in the role than a former SNL writer. His performance just felt lackluster and I doubt audiences really saw him as a real threat at any point during the movie. Besides him, Bill Murray, and Leslie Jones also seemed to bring pretty weak characters to the screen. I have no idea if Bill Murray was forced to be there but it sure looked like it. Jones just appears to be a one trick pony when it comes to her characters but that hasn't stopped Kevin James (yep, random shot taken), so I'm sure we will continue to see her for some reason. The other three leads also had cringy moments but also some funny scenes that I guessed balanced their scales. Oh and then there was Hemsworth who I thought I would despise given the trailers but turned out to bring the comic relief in an otherwise cringe comedy.So, just to sum up my overall thought this movie brings a lot of cringe but I can't honestly say that it is a whole lot worse than the original. They are a lot different in tone though. If you want a supernatural drama with sprinkles of comedy then avoid this. If you want a full-on comedy which could be compared to the New Vacation movie or Will Ferrell's recent movies then this could be for you.",Ghostbusters

Big fan of the cast - if you've been watching SNL for the past decade you can't help but be excited by this choice of actresses - big fan of the original movie and I actually did think it was the right time to bring back the franchise...... but, wow, where to start? First up: it's just not funny, at all! The character played by Chris Hemsworth is probably the best illustration of this lack of humor: he's off but he's just not funny. How is Mike Hat (ahaha my cat) any kind of joke?The shoehorned original cast appears unmotivated, uninspired, much like the audience at that point... The 4 actresses who are great just don't click: Kate McInnon overplays, Wiig is not in the right tonality... I could continue but... everybody gets it by now.

Nevertheless, I did watch it with a tarnished image and a lack of enthusiasm because of that. Ironically, I felt the same way at the end of the movie!It is boring, full of stupidity, lacks any humor, is badly directed and actually left me feeling as if I had been uninformed by the critics around me. It really is worst than they had told me.The original was funny, entertaining and at least worthy of a couple of viewings. This isn't worthy of even the most insignificant hype and that is why it is being pushed on us from every direction. When something this bad makes it to the big screen, has all of the marketing that it had/has and probably lined a bunch of pockets, you have to ask yourself; why?I hate using the old cliché about never getting that time back, but this one goes further than that, I felt absolutely depressed, let down and thoroughly misled at the end of this movie.And by the way; what is it with the original movie cast appearing in the remakes? The ONLY movie I have ever seen where it was well done, pretty cool to see and actually added something to the movie, was Lost In Space. For Pete's sake if you are going to do it, do it subtly and do it well, don't add a token piece that, if anything, actually only made it all seem less entertaining.Synopsis: if you want entertainment - try slapping yourself across the face in front of a mirror. It will produce a sensation that will be a order of magnitude more enjoyable than this drivel. Pity, because I like every single actor/actress in this movie. What a shame...",Ghostbusters
284,hthbrr2,Sexism is alive and well.,10,26 October 2016,"I know this site is used by all people around the world. But in the USA when we hold elections the whole world watches. This movie reminded me of the 2008 US election.The vote was between a black guy and a woman. The black guy won in short, because he was a man. To me, the 2008 election answered the question: is America more sexist or racist? Turns out we don't care if a man is black (Obama), gay (Michael Kors), crazy (Trump), a child molester (Michael Jackson), a rapist (Roman Polanski), or a murderer (OJ Simpson). As long as they are a man it's OK. If a woman were to do THE SAME THING as a man she will get punished to the fullest extent of the law, be publicly shamed, and probably illegal things the media does not event talk about: harassment and general mistreatment. Hell even women who are VICTIMS of crimes get punished for no reason. A woman who was BEATEN by her husband was sentenced to more jail time for not protecting her child from him. Who was ALSO being beaten by the husband. The husband served 2 years, she is still in jail. He's out and now free to beat the child as much as he wants. How will she protect the child if she is behind bars????The hate this movie received was really undeserved. All that hate was just sexism basically. They rebooted a movie? Isn't that what has been happening for the past 10 years? But WHY is this one specifically bad? Oh yes, because women are in the roles instead of the men. They rebooted Spider-Man for god sakes! 10 years had not even passed from the last spider man movie. They rebooted Bat-Man so many times. They re-made old TV shows into movies (Land Of the Lost, Get Smart, Star Trek, etc.) James Bond, Dredd, Planet of the Apes, Superman, Hulk, Green Lantern, ... at this point there are very few ORIGINAL movie ideas. Everything is loosely based on something at this point that came before. NONE of those movies received as much hate as this one did.This movie MADE ME LAUGH. The graphics were top notch, and it was fun to watch. No movie is perfect. But the way I rate is either it was good or bad. I don't knock off a star for some little thing I did not like in the movie. I liked this movie, it was fun to watch.Very sad that it received all this hate. Too bad most men are so threatened by women. Pretty sick that most believe that a woman's place is in the kitchen. In our ever evolving/advancing world, it's getting harder to be sexist/ignorant/racist. So people disguise their hatred in different forms. ""Obama is an idiot."" Maybe he is, but you suspect that it's racism since they don't point out any specific reason for him to be an idiot. ""This movie sucks."" Why? They harp on and on about how it's 'disrespects' the original. Even though most of the original actors made cameos in the movie. Well why does EVERY OTHER REBOOTED movie not 'disrespect' the original? 'Disrespect' is code for: women are not meant to have any power in the world. They have to be 'good little girls' aka: stay silent and take abuse. Another example: In the new Flash TV-reboot people complain about his love interest being black. They don't outright say it. They just vaguely complain about her. 'She is a bad character' is code for she is black and it's not OK. These ignorant people direct hate towards anything that challenges their narrow world view.So sad....this movie turned out to be one big litmus test to see how sexist people are. So sad that most men think women should not be in starring roles/have power. Yet are OK with men doing the same...sexism. I watched the movie and it was fine, very fun actually. I laughed out loud. I am a big comedy fan. And not many movies actually make me laugh. This one did. I watched the movie to make sure it if it was good or bad. But people hated on the movie before it even came out.To be fair people made fun of Heath Ledger's Joker before The Dark Knight came out. But it came out and people changed their mind. But this movie it was unreasonable hatred. ""Women must be controlled!"" - sexist people. So very very sad.....",Ghostbusters
285,Wirxaw,Weak stand-up comedy with CGI.,4,9 October 2016,"I have to admit, I despised the trailer, was spoiled by reviews and generally expected a failure, but... well, it's complicated.Let's begin by realizing that the movie's concept is clear and it's fine - the total reversal of the genders. Take the original GB - they have the foolish damsel, four dirty comical guys and... a lot of CGI. So what did the director try to achieve with GB3? Well, I can't in all honesty say - ""deliver a good GB movie"". That would be an insult to the franchise. He tried to make a cinematical experiment - a female comedy. And that... well, it worked out. I might not like the movie, but I won't stand in line with people who say there is no chemistry or acting, or who only recognize Thor.To give credit where it's due - the cast really tried and did their best. Unfortunately, while the same can be said about many movies - it does not apply to the script. Truly, I don't mind how it worked out in general, in fact - technically watching the movie was actually enjoyable. Especially Rowan was played hilariously. But... that core reason of the movie - female comedy, there is an issue there.I think the writers misunderstood the idea of comedy and tried to make an embarrassing feminist showdown. You see, everyone has a role. Men might be the bigger part of the industry, but there are plenty of examples of female comedy. I know it sounds blasphemous, but Marlon Wayans movies have significantly more fun to them(even 50 shades of black) than Ghostbusters 3. And they have main female characters. Why? Because female characters ""are"" female. They do their job, they do it well - and it works.In Ghostbusters 3 - there is technically ""no"" female comedy whatsoever. Well, besides a few genital innuendos, thank you very much. Why do you think there is a saying ""to act like a girl""? Because when a man acts like a girl - it looks exactly like that, stupid. And there is no changing that. Similarly, when feminists try to occupy man's turf, any sane person sees a bunch of sad clowns fighting over a ball. And that's exactly what this movie is - female actors trying, desperately... to look like men. And that's not a point of perspective, I would very much like to see female Ghostbusters. Just now as a... you know, Saturday Night Live level of content.The director should've realized that he is making a major franchise movie, in his reins is the legacy that the fans expect. By all means, show us women, but give them some dignity. It has to earned, not claimed as a victim of harassment and death threats. But as it stands - Ghostbusters 3 is technically a parody-style exaggerated mash-up, with CGI and plot to make it look ghostbuster-ish. I can swallow, giggle, digest and eat popcorn... by watching it on youtube. But to expect a fan who has paid a fair buck to watch it on big screen - to have a positive opinion about it? As Annie Potts said in the movie ""Why don't you hold while I connect you to someone who might care"".Plus... the reviews saying this movie is ""man-hating"" are not entirely wrong. The one line ""They are mostly dudes"" feels like post-effect added to address the hatred the movie received. And it sounded as stupid as you might expect",Ghostbusters

290,villard,Belly Busting Nonstop Laughs,10,16 July 2016,"I never found the original 1984 Ghostbusters all that funny -- especially Bill Murray's quirky shtick. I went to the sequel out of curiosity to see what happens when the roles are swapped. Would the whole thing just be a gimmick?I was delighted to find nonstop laughter from a far more energetic and fast-paced sequel from the original --propelled by a clever script and great comedy acting. It's hard to go wrong when you have the wacky antics of Melissa McCarthy in the mix. And, SNL's Kate McKinnon plays a wonderfully amusing geeky and slightly maniacal scientist that just keep you giggling. Also, nice to see the Thor hulk, Chris Emsworth, play a Monty Python-like silly character in his role as office secretary. The flirtatious play between him and the ladies is lots of fun.I was also glad to seen the film pay homage to the storyline and style of the first film. However, having the predictably gratuitous cameos by some of the original cast didn't add to the laugh momentum at all. Despite the negative reviews I certainly would not consider anything in the film tokenism or sexist. Are people so thin-skinned about what they perceive these days as ""politically correct?"" This film would not have been nearly as engaging with an all-male cast. It would have been just another boring sequel that would have invited endless comparisons to the original actors.About halfway through the film the tight-paced hilarity throttles back for the predictable huge battle with an army of ghosts. These inevitable climatic special effects orgasms get tiring. This is by far one of the most entertaining and funniest films I've seen in a very long time. I'm delighted that they seem to have left the door open for a sequel.",Ghostbusters
291,taryllsbaker,A fairly enjoyable popcorn flick.,6,12 July 2016,"Ghostbusters is directed by Paul Feig and stars Melissa McCarthy, Kate McKinnon, Kristen Wiig, Leslie Jones & Chris Hemsworth.Following a mysterious ghost invasion in Manhattan, a pair of paranormal enthusiasts, a subway worker and a nuclear engineer band together to stop the otherworldly threat from causing chaos across the city.After many years of waiting, the Ghostbusters franchise returns with a new set of heroes and a colourful special effects palette that provides exciting visual eye-candy along with an almost perfectly and tightly wrapped script. Cast members McCarthy, McKinnon and Wiig bounce off each other wonderfully and deliver some amusing remarks to certain scenarios throughout, especially with Hemsworth's witty and utterly useless persona, which is hilarious. Unfortunately, the writing for Jones' character wasn't so satisfying. A lot of the lines fell flat and ultimately sank underneath the energetic performances by the aforementioned.Now, although I haven't always been a fan of Feig's work, I admire him for taking on such a huge project. I believe he has done an admittedly average job with the direction and writing, but most of the critical reception and fan backlash, while overwhelmingly ludicrous, is an unfair representation of what is shown in this movie. Coming to the realisation that comedy and target audiences alike can change over the years, is something that will give you a fair advantage over the other viewers heading into this world. I genuinely believe, like any movie, that everyone should watch for themselves before shooting angry comments at the filmmakers or the people that enjoy the work. This is one of the reasons I bought a ticket to see this movie.The other reason was the special effects. After watching the trailers, I noticed how vibrant and diverse the visual effects were. This is one of the stronger points that really hold the experience up, it's consistently colourful and fun to watch. I'd like to see it in 3D and judge how this contrasts over the two formats, maybe making a difference to the overall enjoyment of the movie.While these comments make it seem like I'm hugely impressed, or that it's a high-flyer, there were certainly a few sections that were disappointing. Firstly, the villain wasn't very good. He felt forced and extremely obvious from the beginning to end. I'm not sure whether this is due to the writing of the character, or the actor Neil Casey, but I didn't like it. Secondly, the 'finale' section during the last 20 or 30 minutes of the feature felt loose and lacked in the comedy from the previous hour and 20 minutes. It seemed very lazy and didn't make any sense, feeling anti-climatic, which is not the reaction you should get from a finale. If this was improved upon, it has the potential to be a brilliant end to this story. Finally, and most surprisingly, the cameos were poor in contrast to everything great about this movie.Music by Theodore Shapiro is sparse and compositionally simple with mostly predictable directions in string movements, along with the horror/mystery flick genre that was expected. There aren't many cues or themes that jump out at you, and whilst that's usually not a bad thing, I felt it lacked from the overall experience. There is, however, a lot of songs by various artists that are thrown in throughout. None of these were pleasing to my ears and I felt could they have been removed without any deterioration to the quality of the movie.The production, special effects & set design teams along with the art department have done a wonderful job with their time. Most notably, the new Ecto-1 is amazing to look at. Every angle or scene this vehicle features in is a blast to watch. I imagine fans will be looking to buy replicas or even construct full-size functional versions to bring to events in the future.By this point you're probably still debating whether you should bother buying a ticket to see this movie. Maybe you're still not convinced. Or you don't want to upset the butt-hurt any more than they already are. To that, I'd tell you to just go for it. Do it in secret if you must. I simply think everyone should form their own opinion before calling people out.In retrospect, it's a fairly enjoyable flick that put a smile on my face and took me out of the real world for a couple hours. There are a few scenes I thought were out of place and fell flat in the comedy aspect, but I really didn't have a terrible time watching it. Maybe all this backlash served as an expectation that could be easily beaten? Who knows, but I liked it. A personal highlight for me was McKinnon's performance as Jillian Holtzmann, which was great. I'd not seen her in much before this so it was a nice introduction to her work. I thought she came across genuine and seemed excited and pleased to be a part of the franchise. All of her action sequences (especially in the finale) were handled well and came out to be some of the best parts of the experience.My verdict; Ghostbusters is a fun, energetic and visually awesome take on the franchise and I'd happily sit through it again. A sequel, though seemingly doubtful, wouldn't be so bad in my books. Don't take it too seriously.Ghostbusters, 6/10.",Ghostbusters

293,kira02bit,"Despite the juvenile internet backlash, much better than expected",7,22 July 2016,"When original Ghostbusters creators teamed with director Paul Feig to reboot the Ghostbusters franchise, there was little reaction on the internet. Largely because despite a tepid 1989 sequel, there is a lot of juice in the Ghostbusters canon. However, when Feig and company announced that the new Ghostbusters would be played by four comediennes, the internet erupted immediately into a juvenile frenzy comprised of outraged man-babies who apparently felt the original would now be forever soiled by this all-female GB team infecting it with girl cooties or something, withering misogynists who turned every movie site talk back section on the internet into a toxic spill filled with profane words describing the women in the cast and ""traitor"" Paul Feig, and those ""high-minded"" people who were only now so incensed by Hollywood's effort to remake/reboot everything (something that has been going on for generations...hello!), who hoped all would overlook that suspiciously only this particular film was the target of their rage. And all of this was before a single frame of film was shot.After all the rage, withering commentary, sexist profanity, attempts to undermine the film at every turn, and assorted vapors by aged geekboys taken to the fainting couch, how does the film actually stack up? Surprisingly well. Is it in the same class as the original Ghostbusters? Hardly. Nothing could possibly have the impact of the original which was a surprise success in its day. That said, this film certainly has enough genuine laughs to rank it a success, it has a strong cast and it is much better than the pleasant but thunderingly disappointing sequel that the original Ghostbusters cast and crew reunited to perpetrate in 1989.Professor Kristen Wiig discovers to her horror that former associate/friend parapsychologist Melissa McCarthy has released their little known ghost-hunting novel online which could jeopardize her tenure. When trying to convince her to remove it, Wiig gets dragged into a ghost-hunting expedition that ruins her tenure, revives her passion for the paranormal and throws her back together with McCarthy and oddball techno geek Kate McKinnon. As they investigate increased phenomena around Manhattan, they are joined by NYC subway worker Leslie Jones and dim receptionist Chris Hemsworth.The story hits many of the same beats as the original, but works best when not being slavish to the original. There are moments that are on-the-mark funny, moments that you wish were funnier and moments that just don't work, but there are enough successes to push it over. Ironically, the film works best remedying two minor nuisances from the original. First, whereas the original was dominated solely by Bill Murray and squandered the guys playing the other Ghostbusters, this version spreads the material out evenly, allowing everyone to have their moments and have just enough to do. Second, having a main villain, a sort of a Ghostbuster gone bad responsible for the paranormal disasters, is inspired.The visual effects are well done and incorporated quite nicely. Perhaps not as dazzling as the original, but much better than the ho-hum effects of Ghostbusters II. The opening sequence at the haunted house and a later sequence in a bathroom are actually rather creepy considering this is a comedy.The cast is uniformly good, but there are those that fare better than others. Wiig and McCarthy pretty much play the whole thing straight. In particular, McCarthy seems oddly restrained and one keeps waiting for the moments where her character really has an explosive comedic moment that never comes. By contrast, Jones and McKinnon are having a ball. Unlike Ernie Hudson's extra wheel Ghostbuster that never had anything to do, Jones comes into the action early, is incorporated quite well in with the other team members and bring a lot of energy, comic chops and pizazz to her part. Her reactions are often priceless, my favorite being when she walks into the room of mannequins while hunting a ghost. McKinnon creates a character all her own. Sporting an oddball hairdo, bizarre glasses and an attitude that seems to indicate that she is joining us from a higher consciousness, McKinnon capably walks off with the film. This is the kind of performance one suspects Harold Ramis would have given if he (and Aykroyd) were not so busy lavishing everything funny to do on Murray in the original. Truthfully, if they spun Jones and McKinnon off into their own film, I would not be upset. Also worth mentioning is Hemsworth's performance as the sole male in the group. Hemsworth undoubtedly had enough clout to do anything, but kudos for taking such a change-of-pace. As Kevin, the sublimely incompetent receptionist, Hemsworth seems to be channeling the ingenious cluelessness of Gracie Allen. His lack of social graces, issues with answering the telephone and puppy dog energy of being one with the Ghostbusters team, combine to make an endearing and fun character. Plus his over-the-credits dance mix while possessed is one the film's highlights. Contrary to naysayers, this is not a one-note beefcake part (in fact Hemsworth is refreshingly dorky here), but rather a pu pu platter of comic riches. I also must admit that I found Andy Garcia's turn as the ridiculously upbeat, glad-handing mayor rather amusing as well. Although his thunderous reaction when Wiig tells him not to be ""like the mayor in Jaws"" belies the jerk that lies beneath. There are also nice cameo bits from the original cast, with my favorites being Bill Murray as an obnoxious paranormal debunker and Sigourney Weaver as McKinnon's mentor.After a bit of a slow start, the film hits its stride fairly quickly and stays with it. What problems arise are easily fixable for potential sequels (if there are any). This end result is no classic, but is most definitely a fun and feel-good summer flick. Those wanting to be upset about the defiling of the original Ghostbusters actually have more cause to direct that enmity towards its unfunny 1989 sequel than this promising reboot.",Ghostbusters
294,sildarmillion,I actually REALLY liked this,9,25 July 2016,"Of course I was aware of the ""sexism"" narrative built around this movie. And yes, I was motivated to watch it in order to support the movie because it received so much hate. I was aware that it's possible that the sexism narrative was blown out of proportions to hide the fact that perhaps this was a poor movie.I rented out the original before going to watch the reboot because I wanted to support the original too. And because I didn't really remember it. The original was a lot of fun, but from a 2016 perspective, there was a TON of things that made me cringe. I could elaborate, but I'm not reviewing the original here.And finally when I went to watch the reboot, well, I was surprised to find that I enjoyed the heck out of it. I was completely engaged the entire way through. I loved the characters, I loved their backstories, I loved the interactions between them. I'm not a huge action person, and maybe that's why I liked the action and thought the characters looked really cool. At first I had been in the camp of why would you need to shove the fact that it's an all female cast in your face all the time. But watching the movie, I realized that it did mean a great deal to me to watch women be so cool, whether in the action scenes or in their knowledge of science, engineering or history.I get that many people think that this was mediocre, but, honestly, there are a lot of people out there who did really like it, and I suspect these would be women who like action or fantasy or sci-fi or similar genres who would really enjoy the heck out of this movie.",Ghostbusters

It didn't make you laugh every 30 seconds, but it gave out that feeling of being entertained. ""The Real Ghostbusters"" (1986) animated series was a great mix, some episodes were like a laugh every 30 seconds, others were dark and spooky and some were even touching (after all, most ghosts were living people, at least once!) ""Slimer and The Real Ghostbusters"" (1988) animated series was really bad, showing that not everything ""ghostbustering"" was gold. ""Ghostbusters II"" (1989) was another proof of that, it reused the same story as the 1984 film, only replacing Zuul by a somewhat powerful ghost, and the fun for boredom. ""Extreme Ghostbusters"" (1997) animated series restored much of the lost momentum, with its dark mood and sharp humour, and could have been a wonderful stepping stone for the cancelled ""Ghostbusters 2000"".Then we get this ""Ghostbusters"" (2016), a more-or-less direct remake of the 1984 story, replacing Zuul by a sociopath. I laughed more with this than with the original, but that didn't help. By the end of the film, I couldn't remember the name of a single character! Most funny jokes came from the engineer of the team, an obviously stoned woman that is a mix of Egon Spengler, Raymond Stantz and Otto (the school bus driver from ""The Simpsons""), that is, genius mad scientist at its best, and worst. The leading characters (I guess, cast to resemble Oliver Hardy and Stanley Laurel) are not funny, from beginning to end... At all!The fourth ghostbuster is something else: in a rock show scene, one of the ghostbusters threw herself on the crowd and was carried away, to which the fourth one tried the same, falling flat on the floor as the crowd cleared away, commenting that she didn't know if they didn't pick her because she was ""black"" or because she was a woman, all she knew was she got really upset. The fact that Winston Zeddemore was the only ghostbuster that was not a doctor and that he was the only non-Caucasian character on the original 1984's film couldn't have been better expressed. For that one scene alone, I raised my rating by two stars!The special and visual effects are lame. While on the 1984's film, the cartoonish looking proton beams worked fine, they are simply embarrassing on this 2016's remake. And talking about embarrassing, when did it sound like a good idea to add a dance scene to a Ghostbusters' film?! From sociopath to dancing clown, that was a great fall for a villain... And they dare reprising it while the credits are rolling...""Rebooting"" the Ghostbusters' franchise with a female cast was a good idea, as some jokes seemed to work better (although I would have preferred a female and male mixed team, like in ""Extreme Ghostbusters""), but the excessive use of curse words, the man showing his middle finger (for too long) and other annoyances spoiled the fun... And that dance scene, what the hell?! Maybe that was his plan all along, kill the survivors by embarrassment...",Ghostbusters
297,flowirin,relentless comedy,9,29 September 2016,"What a glorious movie.Going in, I decided to 'forget' the original - A childhood favourite - and experience this as a stand alone movie.I'm glad I did. The movie is a fabulous mix of physical comedy, drawn out scenes that push the envelope of cringe, and larger than life characters that work together perfectly.At heart, this movie are a bunch of nonsense, wrapped up in plausible techno- babble and littered with scene after scene of deadpan humour. Having Thor as an empty headed but of eye candy was a nice touch, too.The pacing was refreshing too. We've had too many movies that rush, cramping too much into too little time. Choosing to stretch this story out over a couple of hours helped with the tension building and release very nicely.recommended for an evening when you need to giggle.",Ghostbusters
298,Angry_Santa,"Wiig and McKinnon shine, McCarthy turns it to merde",2,25 May 2020,"Given that the makers were so hell-bent on providing a movie of ""opposites,"" it seems rather apt that the two non-actors - comediennes Wiig and McKinnon - sparkly in this movie, whilst the purported professional actor (in her own mind; I'm sure no others) McCarthy continues her streak of turning everything she comes into contact with into a steaming pile.Yes, McCarthy managed to get a few laughs out of me - but probably not in the context she'd have been hoping; they were all of the ""WTF were they thinking"" variety, with a few ""look at that idiot"" turns thrown in. I'd for a long time been thinking that the only role suitable for her was as Miss Piggy in a live-motion Muppets interpretation, but looking more closely I've no doubt she'd screw even that up (she certainly managed to drag down to failure the otherwise-brilliant Happytime Murders, after all).I've already made a note to keep well away from Feig's future escapades - if he can screw a franchise like Ghostbusters up so completely, there's no telling what he'd be capable of making lesser stories smell like.",Ghostbusters
299,pressboard,Ghostbusters needs Trollbusters,6,17 July 2016,"Two words - Kate Mckinnon - She is the best and adds a great quirky performance as Jillian Holtzmann, their engineer. The movie was uneven overall. Some of the humor worked and some just fell flat. The pacing was a little slow and the chemistry between the characters was not quite working, with the exception of McKinnon who fit perfectly with the crew. McCarthy and Wiig's characters were supposed to have a history but this was not well established. The storyline was very similar to the first Ghostbusters movie but with the reboot they had a chance of creating something more interesting and original with the assistance of today's CGI. Just to set the record straight - there was no Man-Hating (whatever that is) nor was this an anti-male movie (whatever that is). Chris Hemsworth plays Kevin, the receptionist, and is hilarious, each interaction with him brings unexpected and puzzling responses. Despite my criticism the writing was not all bad, just really uneven. There is a cameo by each of the original ghostbusters including Harold Ramis - watch for the bust, who died in 2014 - though I did not see a Rick Moranis cameo (may have missed it). If you are a Ghostbusters fan I would recommend it - even if only to criticize. Pay close attention to the mansion tour guide and his patter - hilarious. With a new (and more experienced director), and better writers, I would not mind seeing a sequel with the same crew.",Ghostbusters
300,dschlatter,"C'mon, it's pretty good",7,15 July 2016,"After reading all those bad reviews, me and my girlfriend almost wished we hadn't bought tickets for this movie. We decided we would simply watch it and not expect too much. And I'm happy to say that it was pretty good. Was it as good as Ghostbusters 2 (the best of the series)? Hell no! I mean that movie had more charm and a surperior way of telling the story. But hey, EVERYBODY knew it would be like this. Most originals are just immortal classics that can never be matched. (e.g. the Terminator series or indiana Jones) I doubt even the old cast could have re-created that same old feeling old feeling. But the girls tried their best and all in all it was good entertainment. It's all you could hope for. Those among you who can't let go of the original? Then simply avoid this movie.",Ghostbusters
301,tommystans,It's Fun,6,31 July 2016,"Just to be honest, I never seen any of the original Ghostbuster movies in full. I have seen a scene once or twice on TV though years ago, but I never had the chance to see it, but I'm hoping one day I will. I do love the original 1984 theme song. So yes this movie had a whole lot of controversy thrown at itself since the trailer was uploaded on YouTube and to be honest, the trailer didn't leave a huge impression on me either. However I was interested in seeing it still and see how it turns and...I thought it was fun and decent. The movie had a few problems, one of them, who had left me cringing ever since the trailer was announced, was Chris Hemsworth. There were times where he had some funny moments like him saying his glasses were always getting dirty and he had to take the lens out to avoid it, that was pretty funny and clever in a ditsy funny dumb way. But when he covered his eyes as he mistaken them as ears you just cringe at him being dumb!There are many problems this movie could've fixed, one of them was the villain. He had no backstory for his reason, all we know is that he's just this creepy guy who works at a hotel being an a**hole. He said he had been bullied or ridiculed during his 'reveal' around the middle of the film but a backstory would've been proper. Plus I hate it how he was revealed earlier in the film, straight away due to his creepiness and use of the ghost machines we know he's the villain. Why can it be a different that the Ghostbusters assumed that it was some other person and it turns out the villain was the one who used him/her to prevent himself being arrested and carry on his plan until the GB's knew who the real one was.One other thing is homeland supporting them behind the scenes and publicly saying they are fraudsters, feels like they are forcing a 'government are the bad guys!!' tag here. Another problem is the lack of explanation of some certain scenes. In one scene after they found the creepy guy in the hotel after he killed himself, Dr. Erin Gilbert (Kristen Wiig) was in a hotel room in a robe after the 'arrest' by homeland security. First off why was she separated from her team and second of all during the fight scene Dr. Jillian Holtzmann (Kate Mckinnon) said to her 'welcome back!' was there a fallout between them because it feels like they cut a scene out that made this part of the plot make no sense whatsoever.There were cameos that felt a little forced but OK showcasing a throwback to the original. Those were the problems that I had with the movie. But why did I say it was fun? Well the story, despite its problems, was entertaining, some jokes still pull off rather well, my favourite was when they saw their first ghost and then it cuts to YouTube saying 'GHOSTS REAL' feeling like one of those hoax videos made by people who want some attention. The build up it for it was good as well starting small and ending big! The effects may not be the best to some but to me I think they were good to look at.I think the female actors that played the Ghostbusters were funny and did some good acting in it as well. Yeah I think the female actors were good, not those sexist morons that think it's wrong of them to do that, I know that's not the main problem from many after the trailer as it was mostly the jokes and effects. But there are some morons who hate it because women are playing Ghostbusters, despite that the cartoon series did that as well and no one cracked each other's heads open over it. I also hate how some people on Twitter were saying many sexist and racist words to Leslie Jones all because of her role in Ghostbusters, absolutely stupid and pathetic of those losers who just want to whinge about 'mY childH00d was rwined'. I hate that tag line! First off the original Ghostbusters is still there to watch and to enjoy even with today's younger generation. Second, no one is forcing you to see this movie and you can have your own opinion but saying your childhood is ruined is just a weak excuse. There are people in this world who sadly had a troubled childhood and there reason is not because of a movie that is being rebooted. Disagree with me all you want, but it's rather petty to make it as your exact reason to hate this movie. I know some people who like the original GB film and they enjoyed the reboot too. In the end, there were some hit and misses but whether you're new to Ghostbusters you might find this decent and fun. By the way if anyone or as millennials put it, 'haters', think this is part of a stupid theory that movie companies pay people to say good things about a movie that people thought it was going to be bad, please don't show your ignorance. There are people who can enjoy a movie be it a bad or good one, it's subjective, like Art and music. Don't expect everyone to hate this movie.",Ghostbusters

I don't know where the strong women are in this film. Or the funny women. Or the talented women... Oddly enough the funniest element of this ""Girl Power"" film is Chris Hemsworth. Yes, a man. Anyway, the SJW's could not or would not admit that the best parts of a film are often shown in a trailer. Why would you show anything else?

I've seen way too many hater reviews that I fear are driven in varying amounts by misogyny that I suggest if you find this fun give it a good 10/10 and try and fix this jaundiced rating! The chemistry between these fine comic actors is up there with the best male performers. The movie has a smart tongue-in-cheek vibe that makes it clear it doesn't take itself too seriously, and that the bit I think the rednecks don't get. It's not an attempt at a facsimile of the great originals, but I swear it's got the fun and nihilistic mood of the original pinned down. I only wish there was more ghostbuster banter and hijinks and less bloody ghosts personally but saying that the special effects worked out OK. I do hope we see more of this oestrogen- charged heroic crew in action - how about taking out slime-spitting zombie-sexist reviewers with proton ray guns - that would be fun.",Ghostbusters
304,anchoreddown,Better than expected!!,7,15 July 2016,"The fab seems to be the idea of cranking out more sequels and reboots, specifically from the 80s. For a lot of people, its a mixed bag of reviews, most of them negative. To date, this might be one of the few positive reviews for the new Ghostbusters. At first, I was excited to hear about the new Ghostbusters. Having been a child of the 90s, I grew up watching both films. Who wants to mess with perfection??? This movie has a few quirks and weird parts. Honestly, I think the story-line was fine and that their reboot is somewhat original. The few things that it lacked was that the cameos of the original cast did not have their original character names,.....regardless, its works either way, but it would make the passing of the torch a whole lot better. The other thing I'd like to mention would be that both the original and the sequel both centered around Dana Barrack, in some form or fashion. The opening was great! The idea of the haunting in that old mansion had some gravity to it. Really, that isn't even much of a spoiler alert. The strongest point of this Ghostbuster entry I'd have to say is the fact that the story-line and the 'language' of the film converging was more than plausible. The first film hinted at cults and the reality of real haunting and poltergeists. This entry seems to take this concept, much, much further. The idea of even having a show-down at the rock concert made it feel like there was something larger happening. I would say, that this reboot could have been a lot worse,.....a whole lot worse,......",Ghostbusters

Was this a Sony Pictures Release or an Early 1990's Nickelodeon TV show Pilot? The amount of SLIME you have to wonder...

I am not a fan of Melissa McCarthy, but she too does well, but sadly it is Melissa McCarthy Playing herself more or less.Leslie Jones to me is a relative unknown, She is not that well known here in the UK. I think she did damn well with the script she was given - The only complaints lie with the Director and Writer... How can you have a so called 'Progressive Movie' then cast a Black Actress to behave in a typical Hollywood Stereotype of a Black Woman? That's NOT the fault of Leslie Jones, that's down to Paul Fiege who clearly likes buzzwords but does not know what they damn well mean.The film is very PG-13 indeed... Which is not actually bad for it... Kids will enjoy the bright colours and it does have some tense moments.After all the hate the film received, I am actually glad that I enjoyed it...Will it ever be as popular as the original? Nope...

Kate McKinnon is McCarthy's current work partner. When they all wind up unemployed at the same time, they decide to work together as more ghost sightings are reported. Leslie Jones is a transit worker/Manhattan expert who joins them after she sees a ghost in the subway.The ghosts/demons appear having been ""summoned"" by a disaffected white boy (who'd probably bitch mightily about a gender-changed Ghostbusters reboot) named Rowan, creepily played by Neil Casey, who's working as a well-dressed janitor in an art deco Manhattan hotel.The chemistry between the leads and their secretary Kevin (Chris Hemsworth) is very funny and the special effects are striking throughout.There are a few missteps in the movie, either due to some minor problems in the script or possibly with the editing. Ghosts sometimes appear in very public locations and are even filmed by people on their smart phones, yet city officials seem to be able to convince people that they are fakes. A minor character is thrown out of a window onto a street, and it's not at all clear what happened to him. If he'd been killed, it would have been an issue for the women. There are some continuity issues here and there.But, on the whole the movie works well, is very entertaining, and sets up the cast for a possible sequel.

The original was so good, it was always going to be a difficult sell, but to get so much wrong feels like they did it on purpose.Starting with the script, it must have set out as a comedy. Ghosts can be great slapstick, gender and social class can be shown to full effect, even throw in a bit of romance cos people in love do stupid things. But no, this one went for the large sassy black woman. I don't think I laughed once.The story has no structure, just a long drawn out zapping of ghost-buster guns. You still have to care about the characters, and I found I didn't. The actors themselves evoked no talent, and I did not want to watch any of them.The special effects were ordinary, and made me think the original was better. In fact, the only time I became interest with what was happening on screen was when Bill Murray turned up and the Stay Puff Marshmallow man; unfortunately they disappeared too quickly.The final act was pointless, and in the end I was hoping the ghosts would win.I'm only giving it two marks for the poor crew that must have worked hard to get through this drivel.",Ghostbusters

315,KaZenPhi,"Just plain generically bad, nothing more.",4,20 December 2020,"This is certainly an interesting specimen to study when it comes to the powers and limits of marketing.While there were certainly some, let's put it diplomatically, passionate comments being made about a female-led ghostbusters reboot by a select group of people which in turn saw a less than well thought out marketing campaign in response, audiences' overall reaction to this film seems to have been dispassionate indifference, which is probably the most appropriate one.Going in with an open mind and not actually being much of a ghostbusters fan myself it's rather obvious this is just a generic bad mid-2010s comedy and nothing more. No reason to get upset about it either way,This was clearly just cobbled together from hours of improv with very little thought being put in before filming. It also has the same large problem that is endemic in a lot of current comedy, namely all characters being too wacky and too self-aware that they are in a comedy. The only two actors who were playing it more straight, and seemed to be trying were Kristen Wiig and Leslie Jones.Comedy is actually really hard to pull off and it's always a lot of work. Just because you had a great time laughing and joking on set doesn't mean the audience is going to feel the same way. Comedy also needs layers and juxtaposition. Making all characters loud and annoying and adding fart jokes is not enough.
Paul Feig had a lot of prime real estate here, especially with Kristen Wiig who is both a terrific dramatic and comedic actress, but used virtually none of it. I don't even want to get into the cameos by the original cast. Those were just saddening...In general I think I'm just tired of reboots and remakes, whether I'm invested in a franchise or not. Anything with a recognizable brand name eventually gets the same treatment.I'll always be up for a genuine intelligent re-imagination of a franchise, especially when you turn a modern feminist eye on long established questionable tropes and roles in the media. That is really way overdue, but unfortunately the ghostbusters reboot did none of that, in fact it may have temporarily sabotaged that cause by Sony blatantly trying to woke-wash it after the bad response to the initial trailer.
Even if this had all been planned as a clever deconstruction of sorts, which clearly it wasn't, why choose ghostbusters of all franchises? They aren't really macho action movies filled with sexist stereotypes.
Why not a female James Bond, Ethan Hunt or John McClane instead? That would be something worth watching and rallying behind.",Ghostbusters

The worst thing a movie can be is boring and forgettable, which is what this turned out to be. The characters were incredibly annoying and unlikable cartoonish caricatures. The jokes they told weren't funny in the slightest- I didn't laugh once for the entire 2 hours. The film also relied on the comedy to carry this movie and didn't for me, which made it even more boring.The special effects were CGI overkill, and the fact the the entire plot relied on them being believable, really hurt this film.There is a 20 second scene at the end which connects this to the original, but considering you have to wait through 10 minutes of credits first, it isn't worth it.",Ghostbusters

320,Mynameisroman,Missed Opportunities,6,26 July 2016,"Lets put all Controversies aside first. This Movie is nothing more than a mediocre Popcorn Movie you watch once, maybe twice and never again. It's not a classic, its not really great but it certainly isn't as bad as people want you to believe. The Movie starts strong. The first 10 Minutes you almost have this feeling that you are watching an actual great Movie... The mood is just right until the first fart joke! Then everything goes slightly downhill. The first 30-60 Minutes are still okay. If the Movie would have at least continued at this level it could almost have been a good movie. but sadly this is when things go real bad. Then it becomes this standard Hollywood Superhero Movie with a bad Storyline and an even more bad ending. The Most jokes you feel like... well yeah nice... you might smile a little but never laugh out loud!I I only really laughed for the first time in the post credits scenes! Thats kinda strange i think. Or at least a little late.Something that totally brought this Movie down was the Charakter of Chris Hemsworth. No one can be that stupid! Too bad they didn't write him a better Character because even though his Role sucked he played it very well. Could have been a good Character but this here... Come on! NO!Another bad thing were the Cameos. Too many and too bad. They should have left them out. Didn't they noticed that they don't work? And the Way they are put into the Movie feels Forced. Like ""In your Face"". The should have handled it differently...Fixing those Problems and giving the Movie a better Villain and Finale could have made this movie into a great one. Too bad they screwed it up.Lots of jokes also felt forced into the story like... A running Gag of Abby getting Chinese from the same Restaurant and always complaining about the Food... If the Food was really so bad why would someone who is right in his mind ever buy the same bad Food from the same Restaurant? You would choose another one that is better! Of course they needed a running Gag here and a Resolution in the End for that Chinese Food but its just feels so forced just to fit the ""Success Formula"" of Hollywood. Apart from the Bad Things you really feel that they had a lot of fun doing it and they really wanted to make a great Movie but they failed badly which is very sad.I rate this Movie with a close 6/10. a lower rating wouldn't be fair since although it has its shortcomings the movie isn't as bad a everyone wants to make you think.Remake the Remake or Sequel? I don't think we really need to Reboot the Reboot because it might not have been a great Movie you could still fix it somehow in a Sequel. Get better Writers and do a better Story. Leave out the Bad Jokes and improve Chris Hemsworths Character and maybe the next sequel could be the Ghostbusters Movie people are waiting for. Also you could still link the new Ghostbusters to the old ones. Movies change things like that all the time so they could find out there were Ghosts here 30 years ago, the original Ghostbusters fought them off and then they got out of business because of no ghosts for 20 years. Everyone forgot they existed and they are remembering again because of what happened in the first Movie. So after all there is still hope in a way to fix some Problems and make a great Sequel that fixes all Problems of the first Movie.",Ghostbusters
321,mcgrew,Not worth your time,2,21 July 2016,"The writer of ""Freaks and Geeks"" and the writer of ""Parks and Recreation"" no doubt struggled mightily to come up with a good script. The ""Freak"" guy also directed, and he strove mightily to make Boston (and Australia) be NYC and breath life into his words.They both failed. This remake (it is entirely a remake of GB-1) has no energy, no wit, and cannot bring itself to do anything new at all. The actresses struggle mightily (the actors might as well have all been made of cardboard -- including the bizarrely-Australian Chris Hemsworth), but cannot escape the flaccid story and lines they have been presented with.Its just all so lazy. They expect us to giggle like children for the cameos of the originals (and so they are carefully sprinkled through the movie -- including the firestation, and the sta- puft man), and love the story because of it. Sorry, no. They expect us to be enchanted with anti-ghost hand grenades and such. Sorry, no. They expect us to love the characters because they are just like the originals. Sorry, no. They expected us to laugh when characters screamed and shouted, in simulation of emoting. Sorry, no.Nobody wanted to take a risk ""with the brand"", so nobody did.

Are that many people blindly political, or is it just that there's no longer much discernment in comedy audiences?Or is imdb rigging the game? Metacritic, which doesn't tinker with the raw numbers, has a user rating of 2.8 out of 10, with thousands reporting in. The chances imdb would honestly come by a user rating, then, of 6.5, is statistically insignificant.

324,lexva5,Entertaining film to while the time away,8,11 January 2019,"I had a good time watching this film and found it pretty entertaining, silly, not deep, no worries and loads of fun. A typical popcorn movie.
I felt there was chemistry between the ladies with Kristen Wiig having the meatiest role though not much of it. The special effects and situations our heroines find themselves in are over the top, but this is very much in tone with the spirit of the film. A comedy which kept a continuous smile on my face (though no guffaws).",Ghostbusters
325,yourfavoritecritic,A Call Not Worth Answering,3,28 October 2020,"Ghostbusters (2016) is written and directed by Paul Feig, and stars Melissa McCarthy, Kristen Wigg, Kate McKinnon and Lesile Jones. Now back in 2016 when the film was first revealed it was met with severe backlash from many folks around the internet. There was criticism for the film being a reboot, rather than trying to continue the series with the original characters (even though as we know Harold Ramis has sadly passed on); however much of the complaints centred around the role reversing of character's genders as well as the film appearing to look largely unfunny. Now although I find the concept of gender-swapping to be a cheap way to cash in/appeal to woke PC culture when it's done lazily, it's not something that affects my viewing experience, and I harboured no ill will towards this movie. It's also not a property I had a lot of attachment to anyways.With that out of the way, Ghostbusters (2016) is now 4 years out post-release, and I figured I'd sit down and watch it since I had failed to see it that summer in 2016. What was nice was, I was able to view this movie without any preconceived notion in regards to the toxic backlash this film faced. However by the time the credits started rolling I was left with a feeling of mediocrity, as the film seemed to lack inspiration outside of its all women's Ghostbusters concept.Before delving into my criticisms towards the film, I'll first start by saying that I have been a fan of some of Paul Feig's previous works, film's like The Heat and Bridesmaids, prove that Feig is more than capable of creating a decent comedy. On top of that, the ensemble of McCarthy, Wiig, McKinnon and Jones, are all pretty funny individuals who have each excelled at bringing humorous characters to life, however here I found many of the jokes to be mostly unfunny. In fact, Chris Hemsworth (who plays the secretary in this version) is probably the funniest part of this movie for all about 4 minutes, as the one-dimensional character he plays, Kevin, sort of gets old after a short time, as the character's stupidity can only take the comedic effect so far. Outside of a lot of the jokes falling flat, the film seems to get wrapped up in its heavy-handed social commentary; from the villain being a white incel in his late 20's referencing most of the suspects involved who carry out domestic terrorist acts, to the protagonist's in the movie bashing their critics, in a way that tries to poke fun at individuals complaining about the reboot. Angles like this could have been accomplished in a tasteful and clever manner, however whenever the film acts as if it has something to say it fails miserably.In addition, I found the film to be sloppily edited, with many scenes abruptly ending, to sequences that feel as if they jump all over the places. Similar to the editing, I didn't find the story to be all that hot. I found the film had trouble setting the universe's rule as far as how to defeat the spirits, this was pretty evident during the film's climax wherein the Ghostbusters are taking on a mob of ghosts and they're attacking them as if they are zombies; when earlier in the film the crew was trapping ghosts as a means to contain/defeat the aggressor, similar to the original.Overall I don't have a ton of positive things to say about Ghostbusters (2016), from the choppy editing, CGI slog-fest of an ending and unfunny comedic bits, it just amounts to a very dismal film. Which is a shame, as this could've been something pretty decent given the filmmakers involved. If they had just taken more time to work out the film's kinks throughout the process of making this movie, audience's would have probably been treated to a better film, I mean they basically had 25 years to perfect a new Ghostbusters movie and they somehow failed. It's definitely not the worst film ever made, in fact, I have seen people praise the film, which is all well and good, but knowing the talent involved, it's very disappointing to see what could have been somewhat of a decent film, reduced to forgotten rubbish. I should iterate that this is just my opinion, and if you did find enjoyment in the film then all the power to you, but I just can't recommend this film to anyone who happened to miss it, as I did, and for that reason, I'm giving Ghostbusters (2016) a 3/10",Ghostbusters
326,bethlori,The best Ghostbusters movie since Ghostbusters (1984).,10,31 July 2021,So Melissa McCarthy gives her best performance in thus film and it's pretty much like SNL made a spoof of Ghostbusters movie!! So the best thing about this movie is there is not nudity just adult humor! And it's very suitable for all ages and there's only one thing about this movie is it gets boring between an hour and twenty minutes but then 20 minutes later the jokes revamp!! It's non stop jokes ( sometimes) and it deserves to be praised ( critics) And the replacing the boys with the girls is a smart idea!! Now a character that kinda gets on your nerves is Kevin played by Thor!!Now the jokes wears people out but ( hey) it's great non stop jokes is good when it's fresh now some jokes are fresh and some are replaying crush on Kevin which has sexual word play but that all!! This movie is never scary. It's just like the 1984 Ghostbusters maybe scary but never like the exorcist!! Now there is a plot but it's confusing!! So I won't do a plot! But I am surprised that this movie has hit 6.7 on IMDB. That just tells you as more people watch this they like it more! And the critics has killed this film saying oh it's crazy and horrible ( just die critics) and think I have covered everything of this movie I hope you will read this and I joy my thoughts and opinions bye!!,Ghostbusters
327,ericnottelling,maybe the worst movie of the year,3,22 July 2016,"this movie was horrible. There was 1 funny line in the whole movie by Leslie Jones. The rest of it was just horrible. The script was awful, the acting was awful and ripping off the old one is disgraceful. I don't know why people from the original came in to do cameo. I guess it was a pay check. Fact is the story was so bad I was looking at email on my phone after 20 minutes in. They simply didn't know where to go with this cast. They wanted everyone to be the funny one, but yet they simply couldn't pull it together. They totally lost the chemistry and the feel for each character. The ""egon"" like one was so bad it was hard to even watch her. She was neither nerdy or cool. She surely wasn't funny in desperate attempts to be.They really didn't need to make this movie.

330,trooper5783,What are you people complaining about? This movie was great!,10,26 September 2016,"As a fan of the original two films, I had high hopes for this film despite all the criticism from the general public, and I went in with a grin, and I left the theater with the same face. Granted, I only counted 3 or 4 hard laugh-out loud moments and maybe I chuckled in few and far-in between jokes, but even though the movie wasn't prone to being absolutely hilarious throughout, I still had a goofily happy smile on my face throughout a lot of the inspired gags. The way the special effects are updated from the original movie is not only impressive for how much CGI has evolved, but the new monsters that were created were creative and also, as they should be, creepy enough to build up suspense, but also not too scary to keep the younger audiences away from the movie-viewing experience. But the cast, however, is the stand-out factor of this movie as their characters are love-able, energetic, and well-realized. Don't listen to the butt-hurt haters who just demand every perfect movie on a silver platter- check this underrated gem out before you judge it from the trailers. On the other hand, I honestly don't know if watching this in 3D is necessary, as there isn't much in the film that utilizes the technique all in all, save for the ghost puke slime gag that was already shown in the promotional material- the 3D isn't terrible, in some parts it looks nice, but the overall result is that 3D isn't necessary to get the full experience watching this. Go see this one!",Ghostbusters
331,paulmcuomo,"Had low standards, beat them. BUT that means not much",3,12 July 2016,"Yes, there's been a lot of negative things that have gone on with the making of the movie - the most notable of which is the highly toxic labelling of men who detract this movie are Trump supporting, basement dwelling, spouseless, sexist man-babies - just like with James Rolfe - and the additional removal of constructive comments on the trailers of this film. Jokes on them; I'm English, I don't have a basement, and I did film courses at school and University so I know what I'm talking about.For the reasons I've listed, my hackles were up going into this movie. But, to this films credit, my expectations were beaten, as I did get a couple of good laughs. But as a whole, the movie is a mess. Here's why: Firstly, the largely improvised script takes exchanges that would work better as a one liner and stretches it until it breaks, and then keeps going i.e. the ""cat out the bag"" argument at the Mayor's office, or the Patrick Swayze segment. Additionally, characters do some dumb stuff. Case in point, they catch a ghost, then purposefully release the ghost who ends up killing Bill Murray's cameo (one of only two deaths in this apocalypse). The ensemble cast is poor. Individual characters are well acted; the two best BY FAR were Kate McKinnon who plays Gillian, who's the group's bonkers, quirky, hyper-active engineer, and is the most likable one of the four main women, and then there's Chris Hemsworth playing their moron receptionist, and he gets some AMAZING lines that had me belly laughing. The whole cast is poor - they don't mesh naturally, and some of them are REALLY poorly utilised; Michael K Williams of The Wire and Boardwalk Empire is in two scenes, goddamn Charles Dance is in two scenes and used even less, and the main four don't mesh at all. And that sucks, cos I think Melissa McCarthy is one of the best comedic performers around right now, and Kristen Wiig and Leslie Jones are good too. I mentioned the casting, there's one that comes off really badly. Neil Casey plays Rowan - the villain. This guy is a stand-up, who gets NO FUNNY LINES AT ALL. Seriously, why? And his performance, and character is literal Sh*t. He's awkward, uninteresting, unthreatening and completely unfunny. The character dies at the beginning of the third act, and later shifts into the bodies of Melissa McCarthy and then Chris Hemsworth, and then he becomes a lot more threatening. Why give a stand up no funny lines when you have Michael K Williams and Charles Dance who would've taken that character and done something great with it?Other issues include CGI, which was awful, especially towards the finale, one terrible Ghostbusters metal remix on the poor musical score, and dumb characters decisions. But, despite all this, McKinnon and Hemsworth made me laugh. Well done to those two. And to Paul Feig, I adored Spy and Bridesmaids, I'll view this as a one-off screw up.",Ghostbusters

333,radmanart,Cow towing to the hipsters?,10,21 October 2016,"I liked Ghostbusters 2016, don't get me wrong. Melissa McCarthy was awesome as always but. I am going to be really sarcastic right now so bare with me. It sure is a good thing that movies like Ghostbusters and TMNT are completely remade to be more suitable to today's young people. After all, all the people who watched the original Ghostbusters and TMNT's movies are completely uncool. If I learned one thing from going to college as a older adult; everyone that is over 25 years old or above that age, is the enemy of all young people. Was the original Ghostbusters and TMNT talky ivies or silent movies?

334,TheBarleyGuy,"Fun, and entertaining. Calm down.",7,16 July 2016,"Well, it's finally come. The remake that would ruin all childhoods, emasculate everyone, and bring about the complete and total breakdown of society as we know it. I've seen rants, raves, fits, and complaints leading up to the release, but was pleased to see that the critical reviews were pretty good. Of course, it was not without the dissenting voices and man-babies, but I went to the movie expecting to enjoy the work put forward by the cast and the director.At the end of it all, who was right? I was. Ghostbusters is fun, funny, and entertaining, while it isn't a replacement for the original, it doesn't seem to be trying to be either. It's a fun expansion, or torch passing even. Starring the 3 living actors from the original film, and delivering fantastic comedic performances from a wildly talented main cast. Let's talk about that then, the cast is a great place to start. This was one of the things that people were inexplicably so irate about, as the cast had been gender flipped, putting 4 women into overalls seemed to be the worst thing anyone could ever do. The new Ghostbusters are played by Kristen Wiig (Brides Maids), Melissa McCarthy (Spy), Kate McKinnon (Sisters), and Leslie Jones (Saturday Night Live). While Wiig and McCarthy are consistently funny, and bring their usual game to this one, it's McKinnon and Jones who really shine. The pair of them are hilarious, and make me wish I was still watching Saturday Night Live. The four have good chemistry, and seem to be really enjoying themselves.Rounding out the cast you have Chris Hemsworth (Thor) as the hilariously dim receptionist, Neil Casey (Inside Amy Schumer) who plays the rather lacklustre villain; Casey does fine in his particular character, but feels a bit hollow when compared to the original film. You've also got an appearance from the always wonderful Michael Kenneth Williams (The Wire) and a number of quick and funny cameos from the original in the form of Billy Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Ernie Hudson, Sigourney Weaver, and Annie Potts.I mentioned that the villain seems disappointing when compared to the original, and I think this might be the problem with Ghostbusters. Not with the movie, but with the fans of the franchise. While I have seen and enjoy the 1984 film, I am not filled with a burning and irrational nostalgia for it, which seems to fuel a good portion of the hatred directed towards this version. No, this movie will not go down as an instant classic, or replace the original, but we have to stop looking at movies like this like they are making an attempt to do either of those things. No one is coming to your house to steal your copies of the original, and no one is forcing you to see this one. Did there need to be a remake? No, there almost never does. Would it have been nice to see these actors work together on something original? Hell yes it would.However, they did remake it, and now it exists. No amount of tantrum throwing is going to make it go away, so maybe it's time to calm down and let those of us who enjoyed it enjoy it. Also, if your reason for disliking it is the gender flipping, then you need to grow up and I have nothing to say to you anyways.There are a couple of plot and pacing issues, but none of them stood out in a way that ruined the movie. Kristen Wiig finds herself separated from the team later on in the movie, for no real reason except to set up her heroic scene. The ending is a fun and exciting fireworks show, and makes for a fun final sequence. No, it's not the same as the original, and that's fine. The story is simple, and the movie as a whole is well directed and well shot. The scenes with slimer and lady slimer were stupid visual gags that didn't add or subtract anything and I was engaged enough with the main characters not to care about that, or any of the other pieces that didn't work.One of the things that surprised me was how effectively creepy some of the ghosts were. The opening scene with Zach Woods (The Office) was atmospheric and, particularly the first few, ghosts were relatively well designed. It's not a scary movie, but then the original wasn't either. The tone leans much farther over to goofy, but I don't have any issue with that to be totally honest. Apparently there are some who were unaware that the 80s film was a comedy I don't even know how to respond to that.All in all, Ghostbusters is a fun and entertaining ride with a good director, and some deeply funny comedians leading it. Which is exactly what it needed to be, and exactly what the original is. The 80s version is a funny film with strong comedic actors, that happened to hit at the exact right time. This isn't a new classic or anything, but it's a great bit of fun. Watch it if you want, you'll probably feel exactly how you expect to feel about it, and if you're the kind of person who's nostalgia is so deeply ingrained that you feel the need to ruin it for yourselves or others, then that's got to be a whole lot of work to maintain, and I kinda feel bad for you.For the rest of you, it's fun, and I liked it. Do with that what you will. Or not.",Ghostbusters
335,Victor_Fallon,Hellish.,1,16 September 2017,"The original obviously has its fans but even if you try to ignore the sexual politics of the marketing campaign, the movie itself seems to detest its core audience, with the script often striking out at people who love the franchise and hatefully labelling people as 'man-babies' and 'basement dwellers'. A franchise that was loved the world over seems to have spawned a 'reboot' that is fuelled by nothing but hatred, and it shows. It's not a comedy. It's an overly-improvised excercise in bitterness.

336,regula1,The very definition of a thoroughly average so-so film,6,16 July 2016,"There's something strange in the neighborhood, who you gonna call?Well, not Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis, or Ernie Hudson anymore (although all of them make cameos throughout, even Ramis who passed away in 2014).This time around, we have new actresses taking the same types of roles as the original. The role of Peter Venkman, that of a serious and skeptical scientist who eventually comes around, is now played by Kristen Wiig's Erin Gilbert. Ray Stantz's true believer role is now Melissa McCarthy's Abby Yates. Kate McKinnon's Jillian Holtzman is the new Egon Spengler, the tech genius and socially awkward. Finally, Winston Zeddemore's down-to-earth realist role is now Leslie Jones's Patty Tolan.Plot-wise, honestly if you saw the first Ghostbusters film or the second one, a lot of the points are going to be copy-pasted from there. That's not the real issue here.What matters is the humor and the chemistry between the cast members, and that's why this is such a so-so film. The hate and stupidity that was spewed on the film's trailer like so much ectoplasm is just that: stupid, because these women do work well together in their respective roles. The only sexism at work is in good spirits and no, this film won't end up being the shining beacon of radical feminists, if that's what they were afraid of.What's bothersome, though, is the chemistry seems forced and some roles work better than others. In the original, it was supposed to be a team effort but everyone eventually was drawn to Bill Murray, and he ended up stealing every scene he was in. This time around, it seems like the same thing was supposed to happen with Wiig's character Erin but ended up happening to McKinnon's Holtzman. Honestly, this movie could have used more Holtzman throughout, McKinnon's performance was excellent. The pace of this movie also feels a bit incongruous; at times it's an action movie, others a horror movie, almost nowhere does it feel like a true comedy. The humor rarely feels natural, and more times than it should the jokes get stretched too far when they weren't all that funny to begin with.In short. This is not a terrible film. This is not a great film either. It has its moments, certainly there's enough to make the experience enjoyable, but overall it just feels... average. No doubt, though, the next generation of Ghostbusters fans will grow up with this film and see it as the norm, and that's neither a good or bad thing.",Ghostbusters

I didn't post sexist comments on YouTube because a) I'm not a sexist and b) I have a life. But I was one of the people who looked at the trailer and thought, ""Wow. There's a dud.""In my defence, it was a lifeless, laugh-free trailer.A delightful surprise then, to find that Ghostbusters 2016 is actually really good fun. It's not absolutely hilarious but then again (whisper it) neither was the original - and I saw that at a packed cinema in 1984, and remember it well. It was always a film as much about the effects and the adventure as about the comedy.What both films have in common is that they are fun adventure tales with wacky gizmos, special effects and charming leads. I've always loved Melissa McCarthy - surprisingly (and generously) she seems to have the more laid-back role here, ceding the comedy ground to Wiig, Jones and McKinnon. I've never really ""got"" Wiig before, but she's quite charming here, Leslie Jones is very funny but for me it was Kate McKinnon who stole the show - acting like a young (and slightly psycho) Eileen Brennan, she really is terrific and steals every scene she's in.Liam Hemsworth has fun as the dumb secretary (although truth be told, he's a bit too self-conscious for comedy) and it was good to see the originals turn up in cameos. The plot and effects are perfectly adequate and keep things ticking over. And I really enjoyed Andy Garcia, turning in a Alex Baldwin-esque performance as the mayor.So, New Ghostbusters, I'm sorry. Your trailer really did suck, but this film is good fun and a worthy remake. I'm a hater no more.",Ghostbusters
342,cguldal,"Great un-PC remake stands alone (great cameos, too!)",7,4 September 2016,"The remake of original Ghostbusters with a female cast is as un-PC, unabashed, and embarrassing to women and men alike. I see that men took issue that all the male characters were either evil or stupid; they overlooked the fact that all the female characters have some pretty weird characteristics, as well. Wiig's character is embarrassingly infatuated with the stupidest man on the planet just because he is a beefcake. So, I'd say, all in all, the film is not merciful to any gender in particular. Sure, the four ladies are smart and awkwardly funny, but so is the evil genius who break the barrier between the other world to bring the vengeful ghosts to NYC. The African- American character is a history buff who knows a lot about the history of NY buildings, which is very cool (and NOT a racial stereotype at all...) I'd say the only problem with the film is the dialog. It's heartfelt and genuine at times, but at others, it falls flat. It's not consistently funny, which is rather true to the original (having watched the original recently, there is a lot of weird and awkward, but not a lot of ""real funny"" in there...)The special effects are very good. The ghosts, the crumbling NYC scenes are worthy of the high end action films. The cameos are great. Especially Sigourney Weaver is excellent!So, see it and make up your own mind. Maybe watch the original, because the original that some people are idealizing is not that excellent; just special for the performances, which I think this remake also succeeds in.",Ghostbusters
343,JontheLobsterLover,Watched it out of morbid curiosity,3,20 July 2016,"Like a majority of people I am die-hard fan of the original Ghostbusters movie, and unlike a lot of people I have no problem with remaking movies, as long as they are remade well. From the get- go this movie did not sit well for me, and no, it's not because of the all-female cast. It's the fact that the trailers made the movie look bad. There was not one thing funny about the trailers, and it's sad because all four women are very funny otherwise. The movie did have some funny parts, there is no denying that. Those moments however did not feel like they belonged in this movie. Even though the original Ghostbusters and let's say a movie like Bridesmaids are both comedies, they are not the same kind of comedy, and when you try to put jokes that belong in one movie into the other it just doesn't work. Aside from those very few funny moments the rest of the movie was just boring. The only character I really liked or felt any kind of anything for was Leslie Jones's character, and I absolutely HATED Kate McKinnon's character. The cameos were unexpected, fun, and well appreciated. In the end this movie was exactly what I was expecting it to be, and I hope like hell they do not make a sequel. Some remakes just don't need to exist, and this is one of them.",Ghostbusters
344,koen_smit,"Funny throughout, well done reboot",8,5 September 2016,"The original Ghostbusters was maybe one of my favorite childhood movies. So I was definitely curious what they did with the female reboot. Oh my, that was way better than I expected! We have a cast that's always extremely funny when the script of the movie they're in is good. (I've seen Melissa McCarthy in a few movies where she could barely make me grin despite her attempts to try to beat the bad script and be ridiculously funny). All of them, the four ladies and Chris Hemsworth, are all performing their best comedy and it pays off. Most of the smaller parts are very funny as well. I laughed throughout the movie and never sensed it was too much or too little, there's a lot of room for humor within the solid plot. Because the story is basically the same as the original story. Well done with the script, it could have gone wrong so easily, but the balance between story and comedy is great.I felt like reliving the same feeling when I was a child, watching this movie. As if time didn't pass. I had a great few hours. A solid 9 out of 10.",Ghostbusters
345,tramsbottom,Nailed it,8,12 July 2016,"The anti-feminist one star reviews on here BEFORE THE FILM OPENED are just sad and pathetic. I'm 35 and love the original Ghostbusters movies and I loved this reboot too.No it will never match up to the Ackroyd/Murray films but on its own terms its very, very funny, creepy in places, great new characters and it's FUN. You will not see a more fun movie this year.The basic premise is that a sad loner who hates women (sound familiar?) tries to raise ghosts in New York to bring about the apocalypse. Struggling scientist Kristen Wiig gets fired from her prestigious job on the eve of a promotion and finds herself investigating a haunting with her old pal Melissa McCarthy. Tagging along for the ride is genius/nutjob engineer Kate McKinnon and wise- cracking subway worker Leslie Jones. Together they must foil said nerd's plan while trying to train hopeless man-bimbo receptionist Chris Hemsworth (who gets some of the biggest laughs in the movie).The plot is ABC but the real joy comes from the interaction with the characters; some of the funniest stuff since Paul Feig's last movie Spy (and Bridesmaids). There are numerous - though sadly brief - cameos from the old cast and plenty of cool new gadgets. My only real qualm was the overly CGI climax but even that was entertaining as hell. Highly recommended. When that opening Ghostbusters beat kicks in it makes you feel 10 years old again :)",Ghostbusters
346,MikeC19,Pretty Good (From a Ghostbusters Fan),7,20 July 2016,"Well this was a tough shot, a reboot of a classic film. I ended up liking this film. Here's why: The casting was good, effects were great, cameos were fun, and it didn't try to be the original, exactly. Generally, it followed the outline of the original, but it was it's own story, as well. The cast, I felt, clicked really well, and they were all fun characters in their own way. I liked Kristin Wiig, in particular. I thought she was phenomenal. Kate McKinnon and Leslie Jones did really well, considering I only knew them from SNL. I was worried that Melissa McCarthy would be a little annoying, as she usually annoys me a tad bit, but here she restrained her physical comedy, and I believed her as her character. (She was even, dare I say it, kind of cute in this role!) The effects are as good as one could imagine for a 2016 film, pretty darn good! Overall, this could have been a big disaster, but it ended up quite enjoyable. 7/10 from me!",Ghostbusters

349,DrDarkness,That was almost two hours from my life that I don't get back.,3,2 October 2016,"So. First off: 3 stars out of ten. One star for decent cast, one star for attempt and third star for pity.I had heard lots of controversial comments on this film - many claimed to love it and many said it was the worst film they've ever seen. So, as a lover of the original Ghostbusters movies, I felt puzzled and afraid. But because I wanted to see this movie with my own eyes that's what I did. Because of the bad comments I tried to make myself to forget the original movies and have as blank slate in my mind as I could. I wanted to be fair to the movie.Too bad it wasn't fair for me.I wrote down my thoughts as I watched the movie, so here it goes. Before reading it all, do remember that I'm a 32yrs female:A fart joke. They seriously start out with a fart joke. Why all the characters are so awkward? Giggled to the scene where Holzmann is eating chips. 20 minutes in. This feels more like a Disney chick flick. Just not funny. Long and boring scene about interviewing their new receptionist, just to declare how incredibly stupid he is. 36 minutes in. Hoping the movie would be half way over already. How many different angles you need to shoot when the women got slimed? It's like a scene from where a building explodes. Whyyyyyyyyyy. 47 minutes in. I'm dying. This theme music is raping my ears. Man screaming like a lady. Yeah. A racist joke. Of course. Oh Ozzy. Why. One hour in. One to go. Bill Murray again. Did he even read the script or did he go all Garfield again? Oh he ded. Good for him.The bad guy is probably the best joke in this movie. 1 hour and 20 minutes in. Finally something is happening, though still awkward. Dan. No. Noooooooo. Don't. Sigh. So. A ghost ax can kill a ghost? K. Gotta lick that gun because. A female Slimer. With lipstick, blonde hair and a bow. Wow. ADKSDADASDADALKSDJÖ1§2§12. Oh that's definitely Oogie Boogie from The Nightmare Before Christmas. Want to know how to beat the bad guy? Shoot him in his crotch. ""Omg someone gave us white toupees!""

351,dunnypop,If it wasn't Ghostbusters,7,6 October 2016,"There's something strange ... in the world... and it's Ghostbusters. I'm surprised on how many mouth foaming fans of the original there are that a female remake would gather so much hatred. On that note, I grew up watching Ghostbusters and thought Ghostbusters 2 was one of the worst sequels out there. Taking away from all the women-hating, the 2016 Ghostbusters falls in between the original and sequel.If this film was purely a movie on it's own, it wasn't bad. There are some very strong performances by all actresses in the film. The film itself is very tongue and cheek in the fact that it is a Ghostbusters movie - giving nudges to the viewer throughout the film.The premise wasn't too bad - but the film is geared towards women. My girlfriend LOVED this film - and she's not really tied to the Ghostbusters franchise or any franchise.",Ghostbusters
352,thedukeofmovietown,How! Dare! You!,2,31 October 2016,"Point of order before I get into this review, I would be not be doing this review justice without briefly giving you a rundown of my status as a Ghostbusters super fan. I had the first movie memorized completely at the age of 5, I've seen every episode of both Ghostbusters TV shows at least twice and I built a 98% screen accurate proton pack prop complete with both lights and sound. So yes, I'm a super fan and yes, I've been one of those internet guys who have not been a fan of what has been going on with the production and promotion leading up to the release of this film. That's why I have waited so long to see the movie, and even longer to write the review. I didn't want my displeasure with the production to unfairly color my view. Now that I feel I am fully composed, this is my review for Ghostbusters 2016.This new version of everyone's favorite paranormal eliminators is actually a remake that takes place in a universe where nobody knows who to call when there's something strange in the neighborhood. The movie has Bridesmaids stars Melissa McCarthy and Kristen Wiig reuniting along with other SNL alumni in Kate McKinnon and Leslie Jones as four ladies who have taken up the mantle as the chief specter inspectors in the city of New York as they investigate a growing number of unusually high powered spooks running amok in the big apple.Sigh...I could have written and cast a better film with the 4 hours and 57 minutes I have left in this day that would be better than the HORSECRAP I saw on the screen this afternoon. Part of what made the original Ghostbusters great was that it was a comedy but it looked like a serious drama or supernatural thriller. Its shot with wide angle lenses, it had a meticulously written script by Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis, two of the best writers for SNL and SCTV at the time and it always knew just how far to go with it's improv.The problem with this version of Ghostbusters is that nobody wrote it. What I mean by that is that nobody WRITES comedies in general anymore. It's very clear that they just had a general rough draft grade idea of what they wanted to do with this movie and then they just get a bunch of improv actors together to shoot ten versions of one scene and pick the best one. Director Paul Feig has made a career out of doing just this. That style of making everything up as you go along is OK for something like The Heat or Bridesmaids, something that nobody has any expectations for. If Feig had decided to make another of his original comedies, I wouldn't have had a problem with him saddling up Melissa McCarthy and riding her to the finish line, but for the love of Pete Venkman, you CANNOT DO THAT with a movie like Ghostbusters. You can't fuel the remake of the number one movie of 1984, the number one year of movies ever, on pure ""yes, and..."" power. There were scenes that went nowhere, there was no cohesive theme, the editing was shoddy, the characters lacked any kind of depth or arch, and it was shot like an ABC family/Scooby-Doo film. I've seen Ghostbusters fan films that were more inspired than this movie and I can say that without any reservation. Don't even get me started on the Dumb and Dumber To grade disaster that Chris Hemsworth's character was. In short, nobody could be that stupid and function even in suspended reality. It's not all bad though, Kate McKinnon's character was very quirky and charming and there were some pretty good cameos and Easter eggs here but even they ended up leaving a sour taste in my mouth. It's kinda like dropping pieces of candy into a bowl of vomit, the more you see it, the more you are just disappointed that all the good stuff is getting ruined by everything around it. This is completely unacceptable for a 140 million dollar Sony movie.Before I close, I have to address one more thing that really chaps my back and thighs which is the fact that the people responsible for making this movie accused misogynists and internet trolls of being against this movie because it starred four women. They did this while at the same time, they knew for a fact that they started their movie with crude toilet humor and ended it with a massive testicle punch joke. HOW DARE YOU! HOW! DARE! YOU!!!!

355,Kareneo,It's all relative ...,7,3 March 2017,"Thankfully I watched this movie knowing about the terrible reviews and so adjusted my expectations downwards - normally I am a big fan of Paul Feig as a director and an actor, but I can see why the reviews have been so bad. For me? I would explain the extremely low star ratings on (a) people who loved the original film hoping to re-live some of that magic and (b) that the film really is a bit of a mess. Having said that, I watched it through fairly easily, enjoying the occasional moments of laugh-out-loud humour (not many, and more at the silliness than anything particularly witty) and the general abilities of the cast. As comedians I like the cast but the first 3/4 of the film seems like they are swimming though mud (slime?) humour-wise, but when the momentum of the story finally starts to come together the film began to be - dare I say - more than watchable! Chris Hemsworth really is a funny guy and I kinda had to convince myself to enjoy some of the more slapstick stuff near the end (spoiler alert!) with a possessed receptionist forcing the crowd to dance Thriller-style. I think the primary reason the film fails is in the moment-to-moment dialogue. It is like they went in guns blazing to film the whole thing with a barely finished script, and a lot of ad-lib seems to have been relied upon for the laughs, but too many weak moments and limp jokes made the first half of the film a bit tiresome. Having said that, the cameo appearances are worth a look, and by the time the movie was winding up and preparing itself for The Big Finish I found myself properly enjoying it. I hope Paul Feig gets his groove back in future and doesn't start filming any projects before the script is fully honed. Even though much of it is a mess, there is still value in it if you can stick around for the duration. For me is probably a 6.5 star film but definitely better than one star, and definitely a whole bunch better than most major motion pictures released in a year - let's face it, the truly 9 and 10 star films are not so common, and the 2 and 3 star films are like - 90% of cinema!",Ghostbusters

357,michaelrthomson,It missed the mark in so many ways.,3,29 July 2016,"I've decided this deserves more than a 1, more than a 2, but 3 seems to be about the point at which the line in drawn in my cinematic mindset in terms of what happened to this outing by the director and his oh so chummy cast.Let me say, I don't live in the USA, so other than a passing awareness of Melissa McCarthy and Kristin Wigg (spelt correctly or not), I had no idea who the other two female leads were. I saw the press about the female cast, and one could not avoid the subsequent diatribe about how to dislike this film was based on sexism rather than the merits of the film or the concept themselves. So assuming no great awareness of the lead actors, but a deep sense of childhood around this film, i'm 44 so right in that demographic who were terrified by but loved the original Ghostbusters, I have to say I was simply disappointed. The acting, disappointing. The story line, disappointing. The direction, disappointing. The special effects, disappointing. The cameos, disappointing. Chris Hemsworth, very disappointing.Overall, the basic premise they adopted here made sense, but the execution of it was not good. The bad guy was simply terrible, who was he and how did he get that acting gig? Just poorly thought out, poorly executed (excuse the pun), and very poorly delivered.The lead actors, I'm not a fan of Melissa, or Kristin to a huge extent other than Bridemaids and the Skelaton Twins respectively, but I was just disappointed - it really felt like they just didn't want to be there - I know both can deliver more, but here they failed - do we assume they went for the easy pass given any fingers pointed at bad acting could just be called sexist and ignored.The other two leads, well yeah, I will say say I can't say badly done because I don't have anything to compare it to - but there was nothing standout in terms of their delivery either.Chris Hemsworth. The more I see him in films the more I find myself just wondering how the hell he gets so much work? OK, THOR and the body, I get that, but really, his acting is pretty dire, and the list of ruins he leaves behind as his acting resume must sooner or later call someone to ask like me, why is he in so many films. Sure, if he wants to model, nice, or be a stripper, awesome... but acting, no, not so much.The director, well my understanding is he's more a comedy/Rom-com sort of fellow. I'm not sure that this rehash has a genre as such, but I just don't think it's the right one for this guy. Not good, all over the place.Lastly, the story, yeah it was OK and that is about the only good bit I can come up with.It gets a heap of crap thrown at it because it deserves it, not because we are all sexist and thus bad people, but because this is a decidedly poorly made movie, poorly acted and directed.I think whoever green-lights these things at Sony needs a good hard slap in the face and a termination notice because really they simply are rubbish. Passing off this sort of nonsense to those of us who had hoped it would be terrific given the improvements possible in CGI and some great actors and writers around these days is unforgivable. Basically just don't do it, not unless you can find it for free or cheap which I don't doubt is where the Blu-rays and DVDs will be within weeks of release.",Ghostbusters
358,sjalkarjadottir,Boring,4,11 March 2018,"I should also say that i do not really like the old Ghostbuster movies. They are ""ok"" .. but also kind of boring to me... and have not aged well. (they were not part of my childhood .. and i only watched the original first one after i watched the remake)What i did not like at all about this movie was the chemistry (or lack thereof) of the main characters. All four Ghostbusters seemed like they did not even like each other at all, nor did the story seem like they were forced together against their will. 
The whole ghoststory made no sense anyway and felt rather cheap. I mean, not even a saturdays scoobydoo episode would present such a weak story. Then as often said .. a team of heroes rises and falls with their villain(s) .. only there is no villain in the movie, none to speak of anyway. The villain, too has no character and is one dimensional.It may have been a cheesey comedy action flick .. but failed at that, too. It was not cheesy or funny enough for that. Most jokes did not land or were cringy .. and more on the level of ""fart jokes"" which are not funny either .. but rather cringy.Now i dont know why one would think a ghost story would make a very good comedy anyway .. as i found the old Ghostbusters to be rather boring, too. But the chemistry between the characters is much better in the old ones with the characters being a lot more complex .. and also not really heroes but at least partly .. quite some scammers and d***s. They were both rather unfunny though.It is not smart, not funny and speaks to the mind of a 6 years old at best.",Ghostbusters

360,tyingling7766,Some laughs but not the original,6,1 October 2017,"With the way everyone talked about the new Ghostbusters movie and saying how bad it is, I did put the movie off for quite a long time. Then it finally came in the mail via Netflix. So, I watched it. And it definitely isn't the original (or sequel, for that matter), but isn't as bad as everyone says it is. I think the problem is everyone compared it to the original way too much. In this day and age when Hollywood can't come up with their own ideas, you will have people who do that. I'm not one of them.The main problem with the movie was the forced comedy. I personally think Kristen Wiig, Melissa McCarthy, and Kate McKinnon are three of the funniest people right now. Not so much Leslie Jones. She just seems like she takes all the aspects of why people don't like her and tries to make that funny. I can't laugh at that, because it's not funny. But the movie had quite a few minutes where the comedy just seemed so force.Melissa McCarthy was in another movie that this happened in. It was Spy. In that movie, they did try to force laughter, but the one person who you wouldn't take for being in a comedy was the funniest person in the movie. That being the Stath himself. Here, Chris Hemsworth was easily the funniest person in the movie. Giving off that dumb pretty boy image was great.Then they had the forced cameos from most of the original cast. To me, that just says, ""we couldn't do this by ourselves."" If you have to force the cameos in there somewhere you're already in the wrong. Bill's was easily the best, but still. It didn't need to happen. At least you could have used their character names from the original.Other than that, I did enjoy the movie. Granted, they completely ignored the original and said they were the first to discover paranormal activity. The filmmakers seemed to want to make a standalone movie but also rely on the original. You can't have it both ways. If it was a standalone movie (I'm talking minus the cameos) the story was good. It almost followed the original with a few minor tweaks in there.Then there were the different ghost and what the visual department did with them. Having a Slimer family was quite good.The thing I really wanted to mention in this piece is the upgrades. I would love it if the world would go back to the time when technology wasn't so handy and everyone had a computer in their pocket. But the movie did bank on the upgraded technology by having new weapons for the Ghostbusters to use. Some of them actually looked believable as well.All in all, the movie wasn't as terrible as some people have said. But it's also not a masterpiece as the original is. Give it a go if you're feeling antsy, but don't expect the same spark the original has.Rating: 6 out of 10That's it for me folks.

361,PeterWorthers,Who you gonna call? Someone else......,1,18 July 2016,"****Yar, there be spoilers ahead, turn back now. Ye have been warned****After so many people gave me the ""You have to give it a try"" or ""you're hating it before you even see it, judge for yourself"" or ""you love Ghostbusters, there's no way you could stay away"" speeches and because there was a storm and my power and internet had been down for about an hour, I went to go see the new Ghostbusters out of COMPLETE BOREDOM. (Heavy sigh) OK, let's do this.Where do I start? How about hereWHAT WAS SONY THINKING OF WHEN THEY READ THIS SCRIPT AND SAID ""I LOVE THIS PLAN, I'M EXCITED TO BE PART OF IT, LETS DO IT!!"" If THIS is the start of a new Ghostbusters franchise then we are all in big trouble.Let's start with the plot: this thing took the good parts from the first 2 movies, cut them up into pieces, threw them into the air and where ever they landed is the writers wrote them into this version. It did nothing to establish the back stories of the characters; it just throws us into the action but does not make us really feel anything for these ladies even though throughout we are supposed to feel bad that they were teased as kids. I guess you're just supposed to relate to them based on the fact that they are famous female comedians? Sure, let's go with that cause I found no reason to care for them.The only likable character was Kevin and even he got old after the first few stupid blonde jokes made his way. After that, every time he came on screen I rolled my eyes. How many times can you milk the 'there's no glass in your glasses' gag? The answer? About 50. You made Thor boring! This movie should go in the record books for that alone. The other likable character was Holtzmann (the weird chick that makes the gear) and that was because she didn't have very many lines at all and truly seemed to be having fun with her character unlike the other 3 women who were so stiff because they were trying so hard to be funny or good actors. Even the villain (who *SHOCKER* was also teased his whole life) is just a random guy doing evil things, there is no real connection to him or to any of the teasing that is done to him. People say random remarks about him, but nothing to justify the evil master plan he has hatched. The acting, oh dear lord.the acting was terrible. Melissa McCartney and Kristen Wiig were the worst ones and THEY WERE THE STARS AND MAIN CHARACTERS! The entire script seemed to be made up right then and there on the spot. It was painful to watch. Every scene involved someone going off on a random tangent that had absolutely nothing to do with the scene they were in. It seemed they were trying so hard to make each other laugh and not enough trying to make the audience laugh. Every one of them on screen were stiff and emotionless, like they were physically trying to act. You could tell they had no idea what they were doing and were trying so hard to show everyone they could carry this huge responsibility. Guess what, you couldn't. The body possession of Abby scene was the most painful of them all; I had to close my eyes during it. It physically hurt to watch.The worst part of the entire move was the overall arc of man hating. From scene one you could tell they were walking around with a 'we're girls get over it' chip on their shoulder because of internet backlash (which wouldn't have happened if they hadn't been so vocal trying to impress everyone by mentioning how theirs was an all-female version) maybe if they worked harder on the script like they did trying to promote 'girl power' then maybe we would have a better movie. Calm down, you're the Ghostbusters, not the spice girls.I'm not kidding. EVERY MAN in this movie was a complete idiot. I'm not talking 'killer chases girl in high heels through woods and she falls' idiot, I'm talking 'DuhI am a stupid, stupid man..Duhhh'. Kevin, can't do even the simplest things because he's stupid. The mayor can't function properly without the help of his FEMALE aide. The Homeland security guys, protecting the United States, works for the government, yet the mayors aide speaks for them because they have no clue, and on and on.Sorry Sony, no dice. You spent so much time forcing every-ones opinions to change before the movie came out that you missed the chance to reintroduce a beloved movie to a new generation properly. I feel bad for the youth that think THIS is Ghostbusters. Let's clear this up now, it's not a lady thing. I don't care that its ladies, it could have been CG lobsters or hamsters in the roles. This added nothing to the franchise, it was just a really bad SNL sketch that went on way too long. The hate wasn't because of the women, it was because it was thrown in every-ones face constantly that it made you wonder if that was all it had going for it. Spoiler alert, it was.The worst part is at the start of the movie, Sony has already created a Ghostbusters production studio. That means no matter the outcome of this movie they have plans in motion to unleash Ghostbusters on an unsuspecting world.So you can be sure no matter how it does, the Ghostbusters WILL be back; Sony will make sure of that whether you like it or not.",Ghostbusters
362,wackywhovian11,"It's Okay, Not Great",3,22 July 2016,"I gave the film a 3 and I think that's being kind.

I saw the original Ghostbusters when I was 6 years old and I was hoping this film would bring back the memories of being in a crowded theaters with laughter and screams of joy. Uh-this film is not that. I love the idea of an all girl cast of The Ghostbusters but this film was just...dry. I went to the film last Saturday June 16th and it was somewhat crowded and their was hardly any laughter at all. I was like ""What is going on here? It's comedy people. Where's laughs?"" I loved Leslie Jones on SNL but I didn't see the same spunk in the film that we saw on the show every Saturday night. It was a bit tame, I guess because it was a PG-13 and she had to watch what she said but still she was the only reason the film had any kind of humor. Melissa McCartney, Kristen Wig and Kate McKinnon were okay but they could have been funnier but that's just me. I thought it was okay, it wasn't like my childhood but if you want to get out of the heat of summer, I guess you could see this film. But their are tons of other films that are coming out that you can see to beat the heat. I would personality watch this one of Redbox. I wish I had seen Secret Lives of Pets instead of this.",Ghostbusters
363,blazedounal,Good movie for family,9,3 October 2016,"I loved this movie!!!!! It was fun, it was hilarious. This movie if incredibly funny. It has everything I expect from Paul and Team. All the comedy scenes hit the right notes and have my stomach aching. I am pretty sure these are just tons of butt-hurt men and cry-babies who are mad at the ""female-version"". It is great movie.Physicists Abby Yates and Erin Gilbert are both main character in this movie. Gilbert is a professor at Columbia University, while Yates continues to study the paranormal at a technical college. One day, the groups with Abby Yates, Gilbert, and eccentric engineer Jillian Holtzmann witness a ghost in the old castle during their hunting. The video is posted online and Erin Gilbert was fired from college. They open an office above a Chinese restaurant and call themselves the ""Ghostbuster"". Patty Tolan witnesses a ghost in a subway line and contacts the group ""Ghostbuster"". The group went to subway train and found the ghost but they did not success to capture the ghost. Later, Tolan joined the ""Ghostbuster"" team.The ""Ghostbuster"" found out the ghosts are being summoned by devices built by Rowan North and mad scientist attempting to bring about the apocalypse. The Ghostbusters are brought to see Mayor Bradley, who reveals that the city and the Department of Homeland Security are aware of New York's ghost problem; however, the mayor's office and DHS publicly denounce the ""Ghostbuster"" as fraudsters.The Ghostbusters realize Rowan is planting his devices at the Mercado Hotel in Times Square. After the Ghostbuster call the police to destroy Rowan's evil plan, the Rowan killed himself. Gilbert discovers Rowan's evil plan which he planned to become a ghost and command a spirit army. Rowan returns as a powerful ghost, possessing Yates and then Kevin. As Kevin, he opens the portal and releases hundreds of ghosts. The Ghostbusters then fight through the army of ghosts to reach the portal.Rowan takes the form of the big ghost and attacks the city. The team devise a plan to use Ecto-1's nuclear reactor to close the portal and return the ghosts to their own dimension. The plan succeeds, but Rowan drags Yates into the portal with him; Gilbert leaps into the portal and rescues her. In the end, Ghostbuster still working to study ghost and everybody in New York support them ""Ghostbuster"".",Ghostbusters
364,Bowserb46,Silly movie written for 10-year old girls,3,23 July 2016,"Twin grandchildren had to see this. Their friend and her 12 year old brother came too. They laughed themselves silly over it. I laughed a few times, too, but not like they did. I wish the maker had left out the unnecessary adult material so that it could have been PG instead of PG13. At least then it would be suited to the audience who appreciated it. I would not have taken the girls to see it, but their mother was OK and went, too. She also laughed a lot.So, who likes this movie? Ten year old girls, 12 year old boys, and mothers of those kids. For me, I would rather not have spent my money on it. Mildly entertaining but worth only seeing on Netflix or Amazon Prime. Unnecessarily anti-male, but that didn't bother me as much as some other people here. It just wasn't much of a story. I wonder how much they paid for the original Ghostbusters cameos, especially the 15 seconds of Sigourney Weaver.",Ghostbusters

This movie is refreshing and quirky in its own way- an homage to the original movies but distancing itself enough to make its own mark. The overwhelming backlash this movie received just goes to show how much movies like this are needed! ""Female"" is not a genre. This is a fast-paced comedy about 4 great characters who get thrown into ridiculous situations. It worked with men in the 80s, and it works with women now.",Ghostbusters
366,sean-curtin-517-748378,A ghost after a single preview,1,22 July 2016,"I'm not even going to see this movie. The preview alone has destroyed my joy at the hope of a new Ghost busters movie.What did I expect. Well as a long time fan of both the series and the original characters, I wanted to at least see my favorite Ghost busters hand over the torch so to speak.What do I get instead. As many other reviewers have declared with horror, a current sign of the political times diatribe of women hating men scum bags.This is just plain wrong. The original ghost busters had absolutely nothing against women, in fact if you will recall it showed Sigourney Weaver as one of the most powerful women of all time. The Ghostbusters themselves were weenies compared to Doza etc.This is pure cashing in and the complete ruining of a great franchise. I'll bet Dan Aykroyd, Bill Murray, Harold Ramis, Ernie Hudson, Rick Moranis and Sigourney Weaver must be throwing up convulsively right now. This is down right mean and hurtful to all the great work they did.What a pile of instant trash and a tragedy. What could have been a great new Ghostbusters movie, instead has been thrown into a travesty unfunny comedy which is to the point that the studio who created this, should instantly put 250 Million+ into bringing back the classic Ghostbusters with the respect it deserves and get the original cast and writers to write the new script just to apologize to the legions of Ghostbusters fans around the world who have made it the success it was.... until now.

367,Shaun_of_the_Dude,How to re-boot a franchise...,2,12 July 2016,"Before I begin - anyone who believes that this film is somehow empowering or is buying into the 'sexist' narrative should probably research the sub-sub genre. From the moment this film was announced, it split opinion and caused a sensational backlash from all corners of the globe. People sharpened their keyboards and began to form their schisms, based upon their own agendas. You cannot be so naive to think that this wasn't all a part of the filmmakers agendas. Knowing that they could neither add to the GB universe, they took the unfettered approach to attach an idea to the production. Before they even began filming, the producers decided to cash in on the notion of sexism in Hollywood. It is funny how that, for years gone, Sony hadn't tackled this issue (which is an issue), but then attempted to create a campaign for this film that relied upon such a political issue. On one hand, the producers and attached cast bombarded the media with distracting notions of feminism, whilst the fandom (with females included), blasted this film's approach to producing such a cultural classic. You see, this film is a 'boys with toys' film - true, not a properly refined sub-genre, but no less, a product of its time. Fast forward a couple of decades, and you now have a totally different culture of fan. This is the crux of the trouble - did the filmmakers knowingly create a political artefact to open up the cash cow? Or did they genuinely want to create a piece of entertainment for all? - you be the judge. Anyhow, I was 'treated' to an evening tonight to watch this film and whilst it has a few decent scenes - by enlarge, it is exactly what it looks like; a torrid re-boot of a classic that really didn't need it. The cast do not gel in the same way that the four originals did and the dialogue is hammy as the acting. It is like four people desperately trying to show you a representation of the characters of the original - whilst at the same time, using it as a platform for their own agendas. Overall, however, we are left with a film that doesn't know what it is. It looks like a 'Ghostbusters' imitation but doesn't feel like one. It feels, in fact, like a vehicle for the actors involved, and a precursor to a serial of merchandised films that has no real direction, nor story in itself. The scenes begin pretty well, but are tied together with a loose plot that resembles the original 'Ghostbusters', as if someone had to remind them that it is a 'Ghostbusters' film. The music is dire, the CGI looks like it was created in Sony Vegas, and then we have to speak about the third act. The third act is supposed to tie the story together and give us a rounded ending. This however is obviously gearing toward a video game, and possibly a canon of films that will undoubtedly be as terrible as this. There are a number of cameos to give the fans what they want, but they are terribly underused and don't even fit into this world, that... fits into the world of 'Ghostbusters' - confused? I'm not - I fully expect the original characters to be brought back with 'new' actors in order to slap fans in the face one more time, with a ""We told you so"". Overall, this film is nowhere near as good as the reviews would make you believe - I'm not sure how the producers got this film rated, but the fact that there was a review embargo in place should tell you a lot. In fact, when you read some of the reviews, there is a definite split of opinion - and those reviewers who have recommended it, do so in a half-heart-ed way which is, in itself, a backhanded essence of 'Well, they tried, so you might as well go and see it'. There is no real substance to the reviews and seem biased from the off. If you have a spare ticket or have someone who wants to go and see it - I would suggest that you let it go. Not only is Hollywood now resorting to politicising an issue that does not need politicising, but they appear to be selling us an idea that this is somehow good for the female equality movement of Hollywood. But the action, story and dialogue are somewhat spawned from this notion and this leaves a terrible taste in the mouth. So to summarise - this is no more Spice Girls, than it is All Saints. Anyone, any actor, any director would have ran into the same issues that, at the end of the day, plague this film. The core issue is that, it is a film that has been made for all the wrong reasons - with Paul Feig in the corner, plying some notion that this will somehow empower the gender issues within Hollywood. I spent the entire time wondering how on earth this film got made - it is bewildering to think that anyone thought this would be a good idea. However, as long as it sells and it gets merchandising deals, then I guess that is seen as a success. I gave this film a 3/10 - because I will certainly not be forced to 'answer' any call (which doesn't make sense at all).",Ghostbusters
368,Bryan_Roderick,"Zero laughs, still recommended.",4,3 October 2016,"Ghostbusters (2016)Let me start of saying: McCarthy's jokes don't deliver. The very skilled Kristen Wiig plays the straight person in the duo which is a total waste of talent. The writing tries to add comedy, where naturally, Bill Murray had a perfect time adding in the original. Crude humor can be funny if it is delivered properly. Repeated bowel mentioning, with little to no punch line, isn't funny. Don't get me started on the bad editing. Everything is super bright, ultra colorful. A good example of ultra colorful is the underrated Speed Racer movie. Here it feels tonally wrong. Kate McKinnon does almost nothing in the film, and when she does something it is out of left field. Leslie Jones was actually better than expected. The villain, which was totally uncalled for, was played by the overacting Neil Casey. He has been seeing Red Dragon a tad bit too much. There's obvious product placement, which I can't tell if it's more annoying than the bad dialogue. I literally yawned during the star trek pseudo science. Years ago, Chris Farley did great physical comedy. McCarthy tries really hard to be that person, if it seemed more like an accident it would probably made me smile, but then she has to open her mouth and say something she thinks is funny. The entire movie gets put on pause for a cameo that everyone knows is coming. Then it does it again with another cameo that's really bizarre and unwanted. Then again, and again. We get it, nostalgia. There's a point in the movie where the story-line has an obvious plot continuation, but instead it just tries to be funny and leaves a sour and unfulfilling taste in my mouth. The funniest line was actually given by Kristen Wiig which I wont spoil for you, and I'm glad that it wasn't in the trailer. There's a Jaws reference that made me smile.Verdict: There's more than enough writing flaws to take you out of the movie, if the cameos haven't already done that. I can say I still enjoyed the film despite the numerous flaws and I can say that I'm disappointed in Feig. I know he can do better comedy than what I was given. Zero laughs. I'd still recommend watching it though.",Ghostbusters

370,Ben_Cap,GhostMYTHBusters,7,23 July 2016,"First of all let me start by saying that this is not a 1 out of 10 movie. Any review that states as such should be immediately dismissed. Ghostbusters is not a perfect movies and has a few major flaws but I have seen plenty of movies this year that are worse then this movie.The four leads are well fleshed out characters who are all distinct and add a different type of comedy to the movie. There are some real solid jokes in here with a bunch of smaller silly things peppered throughout to keep the tone of the movie fun. While out of the four leads Melissa McCarthy and Kristen Wiig get top billing, Leslie Jones and Kate McKinnon drive the movie comically. They both impress and bring a unique style that would be tough to replicate.Paul Fieg has certainly made his Ghostbusters movie. The timing of the jokes and the type of comedy displayed here are very formulaic and bring Bridesmades and Spy flashbacks. I enjoy Fieg's movies and even I am starting to get tired of the same sort of movie over and over. The story is fairly middle of the road and easy for audiences to understand. This is not necessarily a bad thing, I don't really want Ghostbusters to have a plot from a Christopher Nolan film.Yes most of the male characters in the movie are either goofballs or jerks, but to be honest every character in this movie is quirky in some way. This is not a movie about women being better than men or really anything to do with gender at all. Only people who have not seen this movie would complain about gender in this movie and by the end of it I had completely forgotten all of the nonsense surrounding the movie.I simply had just enjoyed a female led Ghostbusters and did not feel like my gender was attacked along the way.

371,Trupiaar,I Think Everyone Should See This Movie,1,29 September 2016,"Let me explain: For a long time I've been angry with 'Hollywood' as a very general entity. It seems like a lot of the movies and TV shows coming out are getting dumber and more irrelevant by the day. With all the money that goes into these productions, I've been wondering:'How does this happen?'This reboot of Ghostbusters did me a huge favor. Something inside me realized Hollywood has just seen it's day, like all natural creatures, and has to be put out to pasture and replaced with something better. The people that write these scripts and direct these movies, and even more importantly, the people that choose these script writers and directors, are just HORRIBLY OUT OF TOUCH.I watched the movie(most of it, I tried SO HARD, SO HONESTLY). It was as terrible as described in all the ways it's been described terrible. Flat. Super-sexist. Bad CGI. It literally took from the old one, but pretended like it never happened? Why? The actresses weren't to blame, it seemed like they weren't working with much(I feel bad for poor Leslie Jones, you work with the part and director you have obviously).I just don't understand why these things were OK. Like, if we're being progressive and it's 2016, why the blatant sexism thing? Haven't lots of men been supportive of women and women's advancement/inclusion? How did everyone become such caricatures of largely irrelevant stereotypes?It was all so weird I can't even be mad, or even disappointed. I just realize I have to let it go, and Ghostbusters 2016 may help you too with this problem. Hollywood, the times were good, but goodbye my friend, it's clearly over.",Ghostbusters

I really can't see how anyone coming out of this movie could have anything bad to say about it.OK if I think about mainstream taste versus alternative taste perhaps this film was just too happy and tongue in cheek for the general populous. It's not even a remake, it's more of an addition to the series and it's so humorous. The effects are awesome and colourful like joy in a can and the changes are crazy. The only other reasons I can see for not liking this movie is an expectation of seeing the original redone in the exact same way with new effects.That or some people can't stand to see the jarring difference of women actually playing great roles for a change. Which while I'm on it, I do enjoy the recent bouts of chick comedies so maybe that explains why I got the humour. I love it. Balls to the wall crazy.I will admit there were a couple moments that missed the beat for me for a moment, basically when things had to get serious for a moment and I didn't want to stop laughing or when they had to stick to a moment from the original film and not play it for laughs. But those moments were rare and very soon put back on track.One other thought is that I don't like most remakes of late, so if you do like remakes maybe this is the wrong kind of remake for you. Rather than making everything darker and more serious as most become, it does the complete opposite. Don't see it as a remake or reboot, but a lot of fun.

And in the end, it's just a silly comedy, completely forgettable. This is not a very funny movie, in fact, most of the jokes fell flat (with some remarkable exceptions), but, all in all it's a ""nice"" movie. The characters felt nice, funny and sympathetic, and it felt like a genuine (but forced) attempt to produce something funny. But, the improvisational style of humor of Paul Feig wasn't good for the whole ""Ghostbusters"" concept. The original movie was snarky and the premise is absurd, but the characters felt real, with real motivations. In this one, the characters (although nice) felt like cartoon characters improvising lame puns and references to other movies. So, the movie is filled with long and overbearing jokes which may turn it in a bore for many people. For me, it wasn't such a terrible experience, and I was surprised to enjoy it at many moments.

For me the comedy just falls flat. I thought the idea of an all female Ghostbusters team wasn't too bad actually. Maybe the filmmakers were trying a bit too hard to make this work.

It gave tribute to the 1980's GB movies (and to Ramis) with a familiar plot and many surprises and hidden gems to discover along the way while watching the movie. I don't want to spoil it since all were sweet surprises to anyone who enjoyed the first Ghostbuster movies. My brain had trouble adjusting to Chris Hemsworth being in this movie, but I saw the great humor in it and enjoyed the ride without letting his alter ego as Thor get in my way. Hemsworth really knows how to play a dumb blond! I stayed through all the credits and also enjoyed the surprise at the end. This movie revels in pure fun and humor along with wild stretches of the imagination. The ghosts looked great. The acting was top notch by the 4 women leads, each very, very different from one another, just like the original cast was. Most of the gags delivered hit the mark. My husband and I had some good chuckles throughout.

We saw an appalling remake of PointBreak, there is now talk of a remake of Brokeback Mountain, and then...then there is this train-wreck.I cannot, for the life of me understand why they bothered. Ghostbusters was a cheesy piece of 1980s schlock. It was an OK movie at best, for me I like it because of the place it holds in my childhood. Something I remember fondly as dumb fun with what were at the time pretty impressive special effects.But why remake it? Was it that much of a great idea that it needed to be done? Why? Who sat down in a big Hollywood office with their checkbook and decided that this just HAD to be made again?And if you did decide that, why did you make it so very, very badly?Every actor in this looks embarrassed to be there, and is either incredibly annoying on screen, or, even worse for a comedy, completely lacking in any humour! It just is not funny. And the stereotypes are cringe worthy. I'm also at a loss as to why it is funny to hate on men, but the same kind of humour from males hating on women is something that just feels dated and sexist. Are they trying to right the wrongs of the past? Yes there have been a lot of sexist movies that make jokes at the expense of gender or sexuality - and we should have moved on from them.Why rehash the same gags and sexist ideas, but point them at men? It wasn't cool in the past when women were the punchline, and it isn't cool or funny now that they switch this and make men the butt of the joke.This is a massive fail, and I'd have to say the cast knew. You can just sense they are rushing through this turkey in their hurry to get to the bank and start work on something else.I lasted about 35 minutes, and I felt like it had been two hours. I highly recommend you go get the original, and watch that, and pretend that this whole thing never happened.And if you do watch it - try hard not to think about the millions and millions of dollars they spent to do this so poorly. Somebody call me when there is a new idea out there. In the mean time, if you see a movie that says 'remake', maybe just DON'T BOTHER and stick to watching the originals, or go see something new and not a remake.Hollywood has honestly run out of ideas if they think this is the way to make money and produce content people want to see.",Ghostbusters

I also liked the tow or three oblique asides to the coordinated attack on this movie from misogynists online; subtle, but amusing.For little kids, the ghosts are pretty scary.",Ghostbusters
390,Payback1016,The whole Feminist/Anti-feminist stuff was a smokescreen for the real problems.,1,18 July 2016,"First of all there has been a lot of controversy surrounding this movie regarding the cast. With myself, I supported this movie up to the first teaser. When I saw the full trailer after I knew it was going downhill when it got released. First of all the ghosts aren't actual ghosts as there is no supernatural or mythological elements in it that the first movie was made famous for. They may as well be an MIB rip off or call them Alienbusters. Second the cameos are wasted, they only last a few seconds to a minute. Third the effects are disgusting. It says a lot when the original movies effects look timeless and fourth the overall storytelling was a bland, shallow shell of what the original was all about. Feig was pretty clever in making the early accusations as while most of the idiots were fighting over the ""Political aspects"" of it. It allowed him to slip the real things wrong with this movie by without a hitch. His feminism angle was nothing more than an overly sensitive Trojan horse. Don't hate it because politics, hate it for being a stupid movie, forget about it and watch the first two instead. All this was good for was getting people to watch the old ones and bringing back Ectocooler.",Ghostbusters

I mean, it's not all that great either, it's just average to me. Now, my issue with this movie is the fact the the writing in the beginning of this movie was just not that funny. But, the last act of the movie with the final form of the main villain was just really stupid. Not to mentioned the obligatory cameos of five of the original cast members from the 1984 version of the movie, well except for one that I don't mind.Now, what did work for this movie is that effects on most of the ghost except for Slimer are okay and I thought the four main leads are pretty good actresses, but I think they deserved to be in better movies than this one.I'm not gonna blame the cast members on this one, but I don't think Paul Feig deserves this much blame, however, I can blame Sony itself for trying to cash in on all the negativity thinking that this movie is going to be like ""something that will ruin your childhood"" or whatever. No, I'm blaming Sony for marketing this movie as like a ""feminist product"", etc. And I blame the president of Sony Pictures for trying to take full creative control away from Ivan Reitman and his original idea for a ""Ghostbusters III"".Other than that...I didn't think this movie deserves that much hatred from everybody. It's not the worst thing that has ever happened to the Ghostbusters franchise, but it's just average. If you like it, fine. But, if you're looking for something that will get your daughter, or niece, or younger sister, or cousin inspired into becoming a scientist or an engineer, then I guess this movie is worth the watch.

The cast does what they can but it is like they just met each other a few days ago and put together this skit\movie. I don't remember laughing much at all and I can't remember any especially good scenes. The cameos by Mr Murray and Mr Ackeroyd are kind of cool--they are two truly unique talents. The main villain is lame, the ghosts aren't all that, the soundtrack is unmemorable--sort of the opposite of the original Ghostbusters.

395,greg-e-porter,"Ghostbusters was better than I expected from the trailers, not to suggest that it was particularly good, but it was better than I expected.",3,21 August 2016,"When a team of paranormal researchers are outed from their university, they go into business capturing ghosts. Through their activities, they come across a nefarious plot that threatens the world.I expected Ghostbusters to be terrible. I think just about everybody did. For some (me included), the trailer suggested lame jokes and nostalgic references. Consider the official trailer (which, incidentally, is one of the most disliked YouTube videos of all time). It lacks a sense of fun and pacing. It begins with this slow piano cover of the ""Who You Gonna Call"" song and then switches over to like a pseudo-dupstep sound. The music is broken up by extended exposition or jokes and it really throws off the rhythm. Compare that to the ""GHOSTBUSTERS FanCUT Teaser Trailer HD (RECUT)"" by Bevan Bell. Bell's trailer was exciting, fast paced, and sprinkled with jokes. Ghostbusters is such a pop-cultural image that we know enough already; we don't need an introduction to the characters or the driving plot. The differences between the two trailers makes me wonder about movies trailers. I mean, I wonder if there are certain requirements for the official trailers. The official one is over two and a half minutes while the fan-cut is under a minute. I wonder if they had to contractually include certain characters in the trailer too.In any case, the jarring pacing of the trailer is something that plagues this remake. There are a number of jokes that are funny but instead of making a joke and moving on to the next one, the camera lingers in silence, as if the awkward silence will provoke more laughter. It doesn't. It just kills the moment. I feel like someone ought to make a fan-cut of the film, removing all of the pauses to see how it improves.All of the characters are pleasant. They're all pretty likable and they seem to work well together. Chris Hemsworth is the stupid but attractive secretary for the Ghostbusters. It's a running gag in the movie of having the protagonists ogle him, though Wiig's delivery seems forced. For a movie like this the draw is the chemistry between the cast, not the plot, so it's pretty minimal. They gotta save New York and the world. Boom. Done. It's sufficient to facilitate jokes. There is some character development in the sense that Wiig's character learns to accept and be proud of her experiences with the paranormal.Ghostbusters jumps aboard the nostalgia train. I feel like a broken record but Ghostbusters is making me say it again: a reference just for the sake of the reference is bad, lame, and will probably be unsuccessful. Just having an original cast member pop on camera isn't going to make me enjoy the movie. In much the same way that having pretty graphics can't fuel a movie, neither can nostalgia.Overall, I wouldn't recommend Ghostbusters. The jokes that are funny don't quite deliver because the pacing is off and the references to the original feel cheap. Instead, if you are looking for a spooky comedy, why not try something like Shaun of the Dead, Beetlejuice, Young Frankenstein, or Scary Movie? That's a pretty good survey of different ""spooky comedies"" (that was my Google search to find the above options) depending on your taste in comedy. Without thinking about it too much, I might recommend them in that order too.",Ghostbusters
396,kevin_newdirections,"Gags, guns, ghosts, girl power",8,2 August 2016,"Upon release of the allegedly ""lousy"" trailer of Paul Feig's gender- bender reboot of the 1984 classic, Ghostbusters, netizens immediately imagined numerous ways how it could go wrong. Sure enough, this controversy is addressed during the film with a misogynistic, break-the-fourth-wall YouTube comment to a ghost footage, ""Ain't no bitches gonna hunt no ghosts."" Perhaps, this where the reboot shines best – it is unapologetically confident and goofy at the same time. Ghostbusters gets the business done by strapping on a proton pack and carefully aiming at its themes – gags, guns, ghosts and girl power.One step away from earning her tenure, physics professor Erin Gilbert (Kristen Wiig) is dragged back to the world of paranormal investigation when her friend Abby Yates (Melissa McCarthy) and an eccentric engineer, Jillian Holtzmann (Kate Mckinnon), coerced her to accompany them into a historic New York mansion believed to be haunted with ghosts. As the group witness and upload online a malevolent ghost attack, enthusiastic transit worker Patty Tolan (Leslie Jones) signs up for action and even provides a vehicle for their adventures – her uncle's hearse, soon refashioned to Ecto-1. Also enlisted as the group's secretary is the unbelievably stupid Kevin (Chris Hemsworth) who is hired mainly due to his physicality made of ""pure muscle and baby-soft skin."" (as Erin points out). One thing leads to another and ""The Conductors of Metaphysical Examination"" opens in business with the mission to capture ghosts using proton packs and an array of unstable-looking equipment. It doesn't take a while before the media starts dubbing them as the ""Ghostbusters.""If there's something wrong with this movie, it's definitely not the four perfectly-cast female leads. They are in fact the film's greatest strength. Wiig's underplayed style of comedy may be outshined by other casts but she's also allowed by the script to occasionally lose control. I'm pointing out to a hilarious scene when she hysterically warns people to evacuate the city while being dragged by a couple of security guards. McCarthy may be more restrained here compared to her role in Spy and Bridesmaids, but she still manages to be sharp and snappy especially in picking fights with her delivery boy over the number of wantons in her soup. Jones' loudness never comes as annoying to me. Her reaction when a gremlin/dragon (or whatever that thing is, does that qualify as a ghost?) perches on her shoulders is one of the film's best moments. Special commendation to Hemsworth for taking on a role that does not rely mainly in the looks department but also one that requires comedic chops to pull off. His character though is just too stupid to be real: He hangs up the phone whenever he's overloaded with info and stops to grab a sandwich amidst an action-packed fight. The real MVP, however, is McKinnon. She could be babbling instructions how to operate gadgets or just there in the background munching Pringles (""Try saying no to these salty parabolas."") still she constantly steals scenes with her punk swagger.Ghostbusters is a seminal classic that requires to be approached with care and consideration. Director Feig's challenge here is not to capitalize mainly on nostalgia but also to add something refreshing to the franchise. Feig does an excellent job in casting and introducing more ghost-busting gadgets but the script itself (co-written with Katie Dippold) could have use more ingenuity. By the third act, the comedy is slightly trampled by the gorgeous and glowing CGIs that the film obviously laid most of its budget for. I generally enjoyed more the first half a.k.a. getting to know the ghostbusters part. When it comes to paying homage, this reboot certainly does not forget and includes copious amounts of cameos from the original cast (eight, if I'm accurate) most of which, however, fall flat. Stay Puft Marshmallow Man, Slimer and this time, her female counterpart is also present in this film – these are the moments when the movie stops to wink at its established fan base. I just hoped that Feig has more confidence in his current cast than being too subversive to its predecessor. Smart choice, however, on using more of the original ""Ghostbusters"" theme sung by Ray Parker, Jr. rather than Fall Out Boy's version (The former is way better and that, I can agree with the majority.)Purists who believe that Hollywood is doomed to the endless stream of recycling old films will still be hard-pressed to care about this reincarnation, or will even metaphorically spout torrents of ectoplasmic green slime after seeing it. Still, this is Feig's so far most visually engaging film. Did I laugh? A lot of times, actually. This is worth watching for the four female leads alone and for that, it is safe to say that this reboot of Ghostbusters successfully passes the torch to a new generation.

As of today, this title has an average rating of 5.3/10, which really baffles me because I think it's a great comedy.

There was no inherent creativity in the making of the movie, just a by the book cash grabbing project.I thought that due to the fact, that it was only a women cast, could give this near perfect franchise a nice twist, adding a new dimension to the whole idea.. Unfortunately it didn't, the cast feels like a randomly thrown together group which in no way relate to the characters which they are playing.It's cringeworthy as how much effort the cast puts into this, to fit in the shoes of the original cast, but fails miserably as they don't seem to be able to relate to original genius of the previous cast, which made Ghostbusters great.A missed opportunity, and a wrecked franchise is the result of this experiment..

There were some really funny scenes and moments, not enough to make it truly great but enough to make it worth watching at least once. I thought that Kristen Wiig was particularly funny but that all the actresses were great together.

The movie was just boring. I wanted to see the cast busting ghosts but when really the movie focuses on them and their comedy. I was trying not to fall asleep the movie was so boring. Now this movie is not as terrible as you may think. But when you pay $10 to see a movie, you expect the movie to be entertaining, but however the movie did not do it's job to entertain me.

413,masschaos,Well worth the price of admission!,9,16 July 2016,"I was a huge fan of the originals and had very low expectations toward another reboot, especially after hearing so much seemingly informed ""fan"" speculation about it during its ""hype period"" before it hit theaters. I couldn't imagine a scenario where the original actors could do a believable ""pass the torch"" type of story and with the passing of my favorite Ghostbuster, Harold Ramis, my hopes were lower still with the news of an all-female cast, pardon my sexism but that was a major point the dissenters were making. Another huge concern of mine was the effects; back in the 80's computer effects were SPECIAL, and they played a big part in the success, knowing the pop and no substance aspect of special effects of the past 20+ years, this worried me a lot about the new Ghostbusters movie. To me the ethereal effects would probably come off as campy.! That said, the movie isn't a continuation of the original's continuity, but a total re-imagining of the franchise. The women had good screen presence like the originals; the effects were actually on par with the originals but had an updated feel; the story flowed well from scene-to-scene; and there were many delightful surprises like the originals. This was truly a great film and introduction of the franchise to a new generation of fans. I hope all can go see this with joyful expectations!",Ghostbusters
414,jacques77,True to Ghostbusters 1984,8,15 August 2016,"With all the movie doomsday prophets/critics that we have on open media these days, it becomes very easy for personal taste and offence people take to ""an old favourite"" being ""rebooted"". For some perspective: Ghostbusters was the first film I ever saw in a cinema back in 1984. I have rerun my own copy of this film (along with Supergirl which I saw in the same cinema the same season) probably more than 30 times. It sparked my interest in cinema and the performing arts of which I would eventually become a custodian. Let's immediately cut past all the fluff of reviews which tends to be full of either unsubstantiated criticism, personal preference references or elation based on their own framework. Yes, there is a lot of CGI – but then again so was there a lot of CGI in Avatar. Yes, the cast and characters have been completely turned on their heads (there is more than ample reference and nods to the original) and yes, it follows a very stylized and structured formula (well, that is why it is a franchise). If you do not like any of these concepts, you would probably be better suited not to watch a sequel of any kind and it would be advised to stay away from anything that follows suite of an original idea. And please avoid Sci-Fi, Fantasy, Horror and most other genre's outside of art-house, drama and thriller. I have never been a big fan of remakes or reboot attempts of big successful classics. With the exception of Star Trek, Superman and a few others, it has seldom proved to work. My main criticism of Ghostbusters 2016 will also be that this film should have been Ghostbusters 3 and the story was perfectly believable to be adapted into a follow up of the original. Why it had to be produced under the banner of a reboot makes absolutely no sense from either a brand point of view and neither does the premise of the new cast and their journey deem it necessary. Getting to the actual movie, it would always be close too impossible to recreate the original first installment. So what do we expect from a sequel then? Definitely a little of the same, yet something a little different. So we definitely want ""something new"" but to remain true to the soul of the original. Without a doubt Ghostbusters 2016 delivers on this. Though there was ample CGI giving a really new modern feel to the film, it has absolutely no lack of gadgets and science paraphernalia that was VERY TRUE to the original in looks, style and function. The humour of Ghostbusters must be one of the elements that has always set it apart from other productions in its category. Again here the film does not let you down. There is Easter-Eggs galore and Ghostbusters 2016 definitely has the same fine, sharp and undertone humour of its original 1984 installment. I was never a fan of Ghostbusters 2 and Ghostbusters 2016 definitely delivered, for me, a better sequel to the original that the second installment ever did. The acting style is 100% spot on, the directing is fast paced with slower moments to allow the viewer to breath in just the right places. All in all, through impeccable timing, respectfully honoring the original, loads of breath-taking creative CGI and themes that have clearly made some critics uncomfortable, Ghostbusters 2016 definitely hits most of it's marks.",Ghostbusters

418,Kelchubordnor,Just doesn't work,1,16 July 2016,"I decided I love the originals so I'm going to give this a go. I have lost out in the past by reading reviews and avoiding movies which as it turned out later I have really enjoyed. I don't actually really know where to start here.......1, The cast just doesn't work and the script which I think is supposed to be funny just isn't. I heard about 6 kids laughing at a couple of funny parts (they were all borderline 12). That was it. I genuinely tried to enjoy this mess(sorry movie) and I literally didn't laugh at all.2, You have three scientists and a street smart (token) black woman who shouts and screams at everything to make things funny (doesn't work in fact I came out with a bad head). There is just no chemistry there. Also the four are friends in about 2 seconds, Im also not naming characters. No point. 3, The special effects were on a par with a scooby do movie and the budget looked about the same. Plus the ""ghosts"" just look cheap CGI and I got bored with the predictable ""slime"" the same ghost buster repeatedly routine. 4, They go from no money to suddenly having amazing expensive and well put together kit. 5, Chris Hemsworth plays the receptionist, and this is the major criticism. He is literally so stupid and brainless (as are all the male cast) it's beyond sexist. He is actually the saving grace because he is quite funny despite the major character flaws. Slimer makes a cameo as do the remaining original ghost busters (minus Harold Ramis R.I.P and Ric Moranis who retired). I did try guys but the film is let down by a very weak script and director. I go into any movie and try to enjoy it on its merits but this mess had me shaking my head and contemplating why I had wasted 2 hours of my life.",Ghostbusters
419,Adec,"It's not the cast, it's the dull, unfunny script and the lazy recycling that's the problem...",3,11 July 2016,"Just got back from an advance screening, and not that anyone cares what I think, but if I had one piece of advice for anyone considering whether or not to go see the new Ghostbusters film, it is that the trailers are extremely indicative of the final film. So if you thought the trailers looked good and were funny, you'll more than likely enjoy the film, so have at it. If, however, you didn't like what you saw, I'd suggest not wasting your money, because what you saw is very much what you get. There's no surprises here, folks, the trailers are the film. For better or for worse, depending on your point of view. And don't believe anyone who tries to tell you otherwise.Now personally, I was never all that invested in either side of any of the various arguments or debates that flared up during production, it was just another reboot to me. Hollywood is going to keep pumping them out, so not much point screaming into the wind about it, at least in my view. Instead I just don't bother going to see most of them, unless they actually do show some definite promise, which, sadly, is all too rare these days. And I'm sure no one needs me to point out how poor most remakes actually are, either. In fact, to be honest, I probably would have skipped this one, too, had I not gotten a free invite courtesy of a theatre manager friend of mine to see it. A free film is a free film, and I'd be lying if I said I wasn't at least curious, so off I went.So what did I think? Without going into spoilers, I think it's an underwhelming paint-by-numbers mediocrity that will more than likely be largely forgotten about as soon as it is out of theatres, regardless of how much money it does or doesn't make, or what controversies were drummed up beforehand. Neither terrible enough to create too much of a post release backlash, nor good enough to do a very good job of actually providing much in the way of actual entertainment, mostly I just found it rather flat, terribly uninspired, and exceedingly dull. I didn't care about or connect with any of the characters, the story is an ill-fitting frankensteining of old and new, which often don't sit well together, and the callbacks are mostly done in such a pandering way that they actually start to become irritating distractions. To me, it wasn't quite the train wreck that many predicted (and some even hoped for), it's more like the cinematic equivalent of a flat tire, rapidly losing air, making a lot of noise, but really going nowhere fast.Will it make money? Probably. Will it deserve to, in my opinion, not really. Unfortunately it's just another half-cooked slice of Hollywood laziness. Yet another charmless, aimless, factory remake to add to the pile marked mediocrity. Those in attendance at the screening were mostly pretty muted on the way out, as well, so I don't think my view is too far out on a limb here, and I just can't see word of mouth being very positive or giving this much of a boost in the long run. It was just a bit of a non event, really. Rarely managing to be even moderately amusing, and utterly underwhelming overall. Or it was to these eyes, anyway.I'm sure many other people will have many other views, that's just mine.Oh, and just a heads up, but if you do go see the film, you might want to stick through the end credits as well, as there's an added scene at the end.",Ghostbusters

421,jn1356-1,Harold Ramis would be pleased!,7,22 July 2016,"The bad news about this movie? It goes a little slow in places. There is one obscene gesture that lasts quite a while. I don't remember any other vulgarity. The rest is good news.The cast is 100% delight. I didn't mean to love Melissa McCarthy, but I do. She is hilarious. Her deliveries are hilarious, as is her acting.Kristen Wiig brought a nice verisimilitude I didn't expect. She has a kind of sweetness, a familiarity, something approachable that makes you love her.Where has Kate McKinnon been all my life? How is it possible to make over-the-top that believable? And that enjoyable? The word for Leslie Jones is ""perfect"". And that obscene gesture I talked about, that's what I want to express to the critics who say they shouldn't have made this movie with a cast of women.And keep alert for how much fun Chris Hemsworth has lampooning his great good looks. It's joyous! The cast gives a great ensemble performance. The earlier two were star vehicles for Bill Murray with everybody else supporting him. This is a true ensemble, and every character is more interesting than any character in the originals. And I loved the originals! Watch for the cameos (You did expect cameos, didn't you?). They are delicious.And be prepared for the feeling of ice water splashed down your back. There are some nice, surprising chills.One a scale of 1-10, I would rate this between 6 and 7.

422,gtylerpayne,Fun movie with lots of laughs,7,19 July 2016,"I was really surprised to see all the negative comments and reviews regarding this movie. It was nothing groundbreaking but there is really nothing here to get worked up about. The comments about it being sexist or racist are ridiculous. It seems like most people formulated these opinions based on the trailer and just wanted something to complain about.I saw it in 3d IMAX last night and really enjoyed it. Some of the jokes fell flat, but overall, it was quite funny. The theater was mostly empty, but the people who were there were all laughing and having a good time.I thought that the all female cast was a fun choice. It was a good way to mix things up. They each brought a little something and had a lot of charisma. Kate McKinnon was especially creative with the way she played her character. And Chris Hemsworth's character is hilarious. It was actually refreshing to see the ""dumb blond"" comic relief played by a guy.The visuals were great. In fact, some of the CGI was very impressive. Other times, it looked a little cheesy, but a little cheese works fine in a movie like this. I went in with an open mind and not very high expectations, and was pleasantly surprised.

423,lancelong777,Awful,1,27 July 2016,"There are probably thousands of words to describe the mess that is this movie but I will use the word awful. And I don't just mean the plot, story, graphics, special effects, comedy, acting, but even the popcorn was awful. You people should be ashamed of yourselves. I mean, do you watch these films before you release them? Let me start with the actors - I couldn't tell if they were in a comedy or a drama most times and a crazy smiling black woman does not exactly turn a bad movie into a good one. Next, the special effects just seemed to be at the level of the earlier version, there was nothing special about them. I am trying to remember a moment when the movie was funny and I am struggling. In regards the popcorn, I just think it was the lack of a good movie going experience that put a bad taste in my mouth. But, I will say that this is the first time I used the popcorn analogy so take that for what it is worth. This movie is awful and you will walk away feeling like you just wasted 2 hours of your day and you will have wished you had spent it instead cleaning the gutters of your home.

424,jeremy-david-kuehnau,"Not a great reboot, classic fans will not enjoy this.",3,23 July 2016,"Ghostbusters 2016 is a reboot of the classic franchise from the 80's. It re-imagines the Ghostbusters team as a all female cast. For this review, I will be discussing the film itself and not the drama and controversy surround it.The movie opens up with hard hitting jokes such as anti-Irish fences, enslaving elephants and a fart joke about a EVP involving a female ""queef"". You can expect other such quality jokes about a man pooping his pants, a **** joke in the disguise of one of the main characters being slimed, a coward of a man screaming like a eight year old girl and much more.There is a moment of blatant advertising for Pringles potato chips. They don't even attempt to hide it and are unapologetic about it. It's bad enough they expect people to pay money to see this film, but then they cram advertising down their throat.The complaint that the film portrays all men as jerks, creeps or idiots is doesn't appear to be a valid complaint. If anyone can recall the older movies in the franchise, the Ghostbusters have always had problems with authority and in almost all cases, it has always been men. With that being said, the male secretary for the reboot is beyond stupid, this character is so dumb they should be considered mentally retarded, it's to the point that it is literally offensive that anyone would consider this character funny.I assume the animated behavior and antics of the characters are intended to be funny, but failed on almost every level to as so much illicit a smirk from me. The funniest moment is when a person literally flips them off and tells them to ""suck it"" for a extend period. The character Patty just seems to be like a hodgepodge of black stereotypes in her mannerism and the way she speaks.The remade theme son of the Ghostbusters is absolutely terrible, they took a classic theme and turned it into a hip-hop, rap stylized song and it fails on several levels.The movie blatantly ignores source material, steaming ahead and forging it's own path. Perhaps if this movie was intended to be more of a spiritual successor instead of a direct reboot, it wouldn't be so heavily criticized, but the fact is, this movie was never intended for the fans of the classic franchise. None of the jokes or dialog match the thoughts and feelings of the original movie.This is a great example of meritocracy at it's best, dragging the since long dead corpse of the Ghostbuster's name through the mud and making a complete mockery of something many people have held near and dear.People who have never watched the originals may enjoy the film, but the reality is, Ghostbusters 2016 will in no way please the actual fans who have supported the Ghostbusters franchise for nearly three decades.",Ghostbusters

426,rolfesam,A Jumbled mess of good and bad that not even the great cast can save,4,15 October 2016,"OK, first things first: this movie is not deserving of a 1-star review. That much I think I can say without causing too much of a stir. But with that said I can't really go any higher than a five with my scoring of the movie. The sad thing about the movie is that it actually had potential to be something really fun but instead we got this. The main cast tries their hardest to bring the fun to this script. Leslie Jones and Kate McKinnon bring some of the bigger laughs to the film with their personalities (which are often in direct contrast to the dialogue they are given). Something that I noticed is that these two were almost playing duel roles each, you can feel a genuine difference between the lines and 'jokes' that were written and those that were improved by the actors in a way that just goes to make the rest of the jokes that end up falling flat even more disappointing. And now to the bad parts of the movie.1. Melissa McCarthy and Kristen Wiig are still playing variations of the same characters they always play.2. The Direction is an utter mess that desperately wants to hurry the plot along to its conclusion instead of taking any substantial amount of time for any of the build-up.(there are two nearly identical scenes where McKinnon randomly drags the crew out to the same ally to show them weapons she made off screen with no explanation) 3. Action! Why did this movie want so badly to make the Ghostbusters bad ass? The original Ghostbusters were comprised of a group of men who's most physical member was somehow Bill Murray. This series has never been serious and relied of camp but can you say that this action helps add to the enjoyment in anyway? Could you imagine if Harold Ramis had pulled out a metallic boxing glove and gone toe-to- toe with a ghost? That would have been awkward and weirdly out of place like it is in this film.4. Cameos. they are great when used sparingly or in surprising ways (like Bill Murray in Zombieland) but there are 5 different scenes set up for the sole-reason of one-off cameos of the original cast and (for some reason) Ozzy Osborne. they didn't add anything but confusion to the film and were presented to us like they were what we all wanted from the movie in the first place. They are weak, with an exception to Dan Aykroyd, that simply distract from the stars that should be shining. In conclusion its not awful. there are some actual tense moments, funny jokes, and the main cast isn't a disservice to the brand at all. But the bad writing, terrible villain, and all around confusion that the movie seems to have about what it wants to be hold it back. Go see it with a few friends, laugh at the parts that are funny and then laugh at the parts that are awful.",Ghostbusters

It kept me entertained the whole time. It was slap stick comedy at times, and some of the jokes fell flat. But the special effects were awesome (especially the finale fight scene). Leslie Jones and Chris Hemsworth were the stand outs for me. They were both hilarious. All the surviving cast did a cameo with the exception of Rick Moranis. Bill Murray was awesome, and I almost didn't recognize Dan Aykroyd. There were lots of nods to the original. The Staypuftt marshmallow man makes an appearance. Overall a solid movie.

429,tymbus,Ghostbusty!,6,13 July 2016,"There's an hilarious moment in the new Ghostbusters movie when the all woman team are presented with suggestions for a new corporate logo by 'Kevin' their himbo receptionist. The first is a female ghost with a frilly skirt and large breasts. The design doesn't meet with approval, so Kevin suggests that he could make the breasts larger. The gag is typical of the knowing, self-referential humour of this new movie which even pokes fun at internet reaction to the news that this remake would have an all female central cast. Only the most glum at heart could nay-say this remake of the now 30- year-old original. Ghostbusters movie. A smart comedy adventure, it revamps the original movie and has its own feel good mood that left the audience that I saw it with in fits of laughter. Ghostbusters hooks you in with some nice one liners - a haunted house from old New York is said to come with an authentic anti-Irish fence The central cast comprising Melissa McCarthy,Kristen Wiig, Leslie Jones and Kate McKinno spark off each other and keep the action bouncing along. The plot is sort of new and although the central villain, a hapless janitor, lacks the interest of the originals geek and Gate-Keeper pairing of Rick Moranis and Sigorney Weaver, the film holds the attention with fun references to the original - the new team can't afford the rent on the fire station HQ of the original team so have to settle on rooms above a Chinese take-away: cue running Wan Ton Soup gags. Some commentators have found the film restrained but if that means there are less fart jokes then so much the better. There is a point where action takes over from humour - a Thrilleresque dance routine involving the Mayor and the emergency services is cut and moved to the closing credits presumably to better feature the accompanying promotional song and not bring the climax to a jarring halt but it seems like a waste of a spectularish set piece. The cast have taken misogynistic criticisms with surprisingly good humour. And now the film's actually on release, they are gaining a better press. This is the feel good movie of this Summer go see it and prove you ain't afraid of no girls!",Ghostbusters

There are numerous nods to not only the original movies but the cartoon series and I remember loving that as a kid. Lets face it, I can't imagine not loving something Frank Welker was/is attached to.

434,dikaea,"I LOVE the concept of the Ghostbusters either male of female... but you CAN'T have a Ghostbusters movie filmed anywhere outside the US, and especially outside NY!",6,26 September 2016,"I didn't know what to think about the movie BEFORE I saw the movie. I had seen only trailers. They didn't seem bad or good. They were just trailers to me. Trailers sometimes show a bad impression of the movie and the movie ends up to be good and vice versa of course. So, last night I watched the movie to finally have an opinion of my own. I believe in absolute equality of all human beings but I am not a feminist. I believe women have been and still are suffering from a lot of crap from men, I don't hate men because that is plain stupid and insane. I have been defending the all female cast since the announcement of their names and at that time I didn't know who McKinnon and Jones were. I was freaking ECSTATIC when the news of a new Ghostbusters movie hit the headlines!!! Both 80's Ghostbusters are in my movie library and hold a very dear part of my heart. Strictly speaking from a cinematic point of view: THE MOVIE FAILED! It failed big, not because it was 4 women (women can be scientific and action worthy), not because the guys in the movie were portrayed damn and evil (just think how many movies have portrayed women just pretty stupid-damn-evil-mean and the root of all misfortunes and above all crazy and see where the scale of the comparison tilts... so guys suck it up. It feels pretty bad to be on the other side of the pond doesn't it?), not because the movie borrowed from the previous two, not because the 4 women are not good actors and really funny comedians... IT FAILED BECAUSE IT HAD NO AUTHENTICITY, NO ORIGINALITY. IT FAILED BECAUSE IT FELL INTO THAT TRAP SET BY THE ARMY OF MYSOGYNISTIC NITWITTS THAT ATTACKED IT IN THE FIRST PLACE.The whole time I was watching the movie it felt that something was completely and utterly off.. something wasn't quite right... the streets, the sounds, the people, the buildings, and then as I was watching the end credits, it hits me: I mean, who on their right freakin mind would shoot a Ghostbusters movie -and please my fellow Aussies this is not an attack to you and your lovely country- in Australia!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!? GHOSTBUSTERS IS NEW YORK USA!!!!!!!! Some things CANNOT BE REPLICATED! By filming it somewhere else other than NY, all authenticity, all atmosphere, all nostalgia, all emotional connection, all the essence of the Ghostbusters had been lost from the very beginning!!!! If the crew responsible for the reboot couldn't shoot it there, then they shouldn't have made the movie AT ALL!!! And what strikes me the most, is how on earth did Mr Reitman and Mr Akroyd agreed on this since they were both involved in the production process.... I mean even the lab and everything in it didn't feel like a lab. It was too clean, too tidy, too organized, too not real, too flushy, too well taken care of and too studio made up.... The CGI was like the director wanted to not take the movie itself very seriously and set out to make a technically modern B movie. EPIC FAIL of the concept, it least that is how I perceived it. The script and dialogue having fallen into the gender conflict trap, became very constricted (some of the lines were right on the spot of course but that just wasn't enough...). The story should have been all new without of course leaving out the honorable mentions of the old ones. The use of the old cast was wrong except maybe Mrs Weaver and the late Harold Ramis. The ladies as actors, had very little to work with (and I think all of them knew it, especially Mccarthy and Wiig) and the weight on their shoulders was huuuuuggeeeee!!! All of them I think were holding back acting wise except maybe McKinnon who did the best job out of the 4.All and all, the sets, the script, the director and his vision were the causes of the failing of the movie. The girls need and should have a second chance to make A REAL GHOSTBUSTERS movie. I hope they will get it.",Ghostbusters

Last time I checked, it had 272K likes and 942K dislikes. I was one of those who disliked it. Paul Feig, you raped our childhood! Hollywood is running out of ideas now. I'm not against the cast being all female, but add the title Ghostbusters and our childhood has been raped. I really should have saved my money for Jason Bourne or Suicide Squad. First, the good things in the movie:None.Nothing is good about this movie. Some of the flaws:1. Humor. Literally, I wanted to throw up in the theater. The jokes are not funny at all. Not even a single laugh, chuckle, or smile came from me watching this. 2. Story. There's no story. It's all about (unfunny) jokes. More like or childhood in ruins.3. Cameos. Poor Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Ernie Hudson, and Sigourney Weaver. Their cameos were terrible. Not even their appearances can save this movie. I'm glad Harold Ramis didn't see this nor make an appearance. 4. CGI and visuals. God, aside from Fant4stic, the CGI and visuals are one of the worst I've seen in my life. It made me feel like I'm watching a Scooby-Doo and Casper movie.5. Death of the last ghost. Want to know how the last ghost died? His dick got shot. Very dumb.6. Acting. The acting is so terrible. I don't think the cast were happy to be part of this movie either.7. After end credits scene. Was this necessary?8. Ghosts. As said, in number the terrible CGI and visuals made me feel like I'm watching a Scooby-Doo and Casper movie. 9. Theme song. Poor Fall Out Boy. They wasted their talent on a terrible film. Their song for this film will make your ears bleed. Maybe they too aren't happy with a female remake of Ghostbusters.And the list goes on. This movie makes Batman and Robin look good.

There are plenty of verbal and visual references to the original movie that many who haven't seen that one may not recognize but those in the know will.Setting up business above a Chinese restaurant this time, the female equivalent of the original ghostbusters again save New York City—this time Manhattan—from spectral Armageddon with plenty of laughs and special effects.

Bridemaids was incredible, and Melissa McCarthy was so funny in The Heat.Let it be known that this movie did not fail or get bad reviews because of an all female reboot. It got bad reviews because it was an unmitigated dumpster fire that simply was not funny. The other 2 SNL girls, Kate McKinnon and Leslie Jones, failed to deliver. Maybe it was a result of the writing, as I am sure they gave it their best, but they were not funny at all, and even Kristen Wiig seemed to be watered down from her normal humorous self. The 2 or 3 times I chuckled (that is not an exaggeration...you can count the laughs on one hand) were more due to Melissa McCarthy and Chris Hemsworth.It irritates me that much of the cast and crew lampoon it's poor performance and awful reviews on sexism. I hate to break it to them, but women can actually make bad movies and it not be a result of their gender, as was the case with this movie. When you bill yourself as a comedy and you fail to deliver the laughs, it's not going to matter rather you are male or female; people will be disappointed. Take accountability and acknowledge the movie as the big, juicy turd burger it is and quit trying to blame it's underwhelming performance on the excuse that ""men were just angry that it was rebooted with all females"". Bridesmaids was hysterical...this movie, not even hysterically bad. Just bad.",Ghostbusters
444,parrisjim,Decent with a few good laughs...trolls attacked it,6,17 July 2016,First .Don't pay extra for 3d there's hardly any in it...The trolls really came out hard against this one.Of all the remakes this one really got them so angry. Don't let the immense amount of trolls who reviewed this movie set you off it...You think all the bad writing in star wars might get their goat more so why did ghost busters get them so mad.Ill bet none of them are old enough to have seen the original in the theaters. It is a good movie not great..just good..kids will enjoy it..people who never saw the original ghost busters will enjoy it...Its a box of popcorn movie.Fun and enjoy it..too many haters out there..The cameos are fun too..my audience enjoyed it,Ghostbusters
445,depicco,Good enough for cable,4,13 July 2019,"I didn't see this movie when it was in theaters but back then it got some rap; I thought it was prejudice as I was one of those who had ideas about it even before seeing it, but it turns out it was a well deserved rap.
The first ones are cult movies because people liked them, and part of it was because of the characters; we felt empathy with them. Funny enough, it was not Melissa McCarthy the one that pissed me off as I thought it was gonna happen; instead it was Kate McKinnon whose character turned to be irritating every time she appeared. As it happens in Hollywood you can not recognize the personality of a character if it is not based on clichés, and how can you tell she is a genius if she does not act weird and be a jerk all the time (normal people would not understand). Kate McKinnon is the most obvious case, but all characters are supposed to be the equivalent of a character of previous movies; yet it feels forced and formulaic, and does not feel like something a real person would do. In general is overacted and all cameos feel like filling a quota. The effects, though not bad, neither are something out of the ordinary as any movie that uses CGI today. As a good point the characters that appear most on the screen are also tolerable (Wiig and McCarthy). Not a piece of art, but good enough to pass the time in a weekend when you are too lazy to check what else is on.",Ghostbusters
446,ivan2012,Underrated,7,19 August 2017,"It deserves better than a 5.3, which is the average user rating on the day I am writing this. Maybe fans of the original Ghostbusters films are trashing this because they don't think it measures up to the original. I have a different view. I think this female version is actually a little better. This one has more funny moments IMO and the four ladies are all likable. Wiig and McCarthy have most of the funny moments as you would expect. Kate McKinnon's character was over-the-top and a bit annoying at first but she grows on you. Leslie Jones did a fine job as well, but she's about a foot taller than McCarthy and McKinnon so it looks a little awkward when they're standing next to each other. Jones' motivation for joining as the 4th member also wasn't explained very well in the film.I'll give this film a low 7 rating. Definitely deserves a second viewing at some point.",Ghostbusters

The critics seem to have heeded this warning by giving it mostly positive reviews. But the general public has not judging by ratings here and audience ratings on rotten tomatoes. This is a slow and unfunny film. It's not about whether women can be as funny as men. It's about whether this film is funny at all. The women in the film are talented and funny. The problem is no one considered giving them a script as a basis of humor. And the result is a disaster. Forty minutes into the film I had laughed at one funny line. Remakes are always tough. But this remake had all the humor surgically removed before the premiere. Stay away.",Ghostbusters
448,nightcrawlercyp-311-219346,one funny joke,1,31 July 2016,"First of all let me say that the movie was not funny. None of the jokes were funny. The only joke that I found funny I am not even sure it was meant to interpret it like this. The lesbian chick compares the proton gun with a balloon. But Melissa MCCarthy looks like a red balloon so that was funny.The man hating stems from this movie really hard. i could have ignored the dumb blond receptionist guy although saying that he is retarded would insult people actually retarded. I could have ignored the guy that screams like a little girl or all of the ghost buster crew treating ghosts like nothing. No surprise no fear is just a run in the park. When you see this kinda thing the first time you get startled, but they do not seem to know how to act seeing something scary.What I had could not ignore is that even the evil dude could not be left to be the evil genius archetype. No, he just stolen their invention because hey apparently in that pamphlet of a book there were detailed schematics of something they did not think of inventing yet. Also except for the smart chick that leaves the teaching position you cannot empathize with those women. They are angry mad as hell feminists.If that thing were real I would be more afraid of them instead of the ghosts.I mean they are the archetype of the mad feminist. So basically the whole movie is an attempt to prove that women are better and smarter than men. Also the CGI is way worse than the 2 original movies.Literally every ghost except the marsh-mellow man and the logo ghost are literally Normal bad 3d objects to which blue o green smoke effect has been added. Think about a Scooby Doo movie.",Ghostbusters
449,masonbingley2000,The hate angers me. This is actually a superb piece of entertainment.,10,22 July 2016,"To begin with, this film has been slandered from the day it was announced because 40 year old men behind their keyboards couldn't handle the fact they've brought Ghostbusters back without the original cast. One, Bill Murray refused to make a third movie. So this was a second resort, and by God, it worked. Leslie Jones plays the best character by far in this movie, she may not be a scientist, but that's what gives her the best part in the movie. The other character that I strangely enjoyed was Chris Hemsworth, his character was actually quite strong even with such a stereotypical range of jokes. The story line is strong, it's never got a dull moment with interesting plot points and a nice range of jokes. Normally, comedies don't fill me with tension with these sort of pictures, but this did towards the end, where the movie hit its strong point. The story is traditional with a modern take on a classic (probably why people are annoyed without seeing it, and need to grow up a little). I think the relationship between the characters is very nice, it isn't too much and it isn't too little, which makes it very enjoyable. McCarthy and Wiig have a love hate relationship that's funny, but yet creates some heartfelt moments that make you smile. It is fun!Every movie has its flaws, in this one, there are a few jokes that aren't needed and there are some rather cheesy moments that seem a little off. But I enjoyed it, it started off nicely with few jokes to ease us in and then brings it all out of the bag. Sometimes it's a little over the top, but that's what makes it interesting. Also, this is coming from a man. Yes, a man who has enjoyed this movie. The movie does have its references to the original. But this is more of a spin off, and a spin off tends to be less successful and aimed at different audiences, in which this is. All these people complaining it's sexist to men and racist, need to grow up, move along and go cry in a corner where they can't be heard when they haven't seen it. It's reviews are good on Rotten Tomatoes because those reviewers went in with an open mind. Thank you for reading this and enjoy the film. It may not be perfect, but it's pretty great to watch. If you do go see it, go in with an open mind, have some respect and enjoy yourself.",Ghostbusters
450,cammymadden,Please Stop!,1,23 September 2016,"This is a spoiler free review!I found myself watching this film with very, very low expectations. I'm a big fan of the original film and Bill Murray is one of my favourite people ever so you can imagine why I was hesitant to watch this film given how badly received the trailer was.Nonetheless I put it on and tried to go into it with an open mind. I can't say it took particularly long before the film had become some sort of man-hating feminazi, ball-punching propaganda film. South Park's new season comes to mind: Cartman tries to sarcastically show that women just aren't funny and puts females on the spot saying ""make jokes about your weight and vagina"" (just for the record, I find plenty of female comedians highly entertaining and female actresses as well). Yet this film is exactly what that South Park episode was talking about. Maybe in the same way that some guys find dick jokes funny, there is a small percentage of women who find vagina jokes funny but for me, it was just weird. All the males in this film are either as dumb as it gets (Chris Hemsworth) or they act like scared little children. I found that men in the film often used the term ""girls"" to refer to the group just before something bad happened to him. I won't mention how the film ends but lets just say it sends a pretty strong message. There were moments in the film I enjoyed but the man-hate just clouded over all of that. Not to mention that the cameos from the remaining living cast was like a ghostly hand reaching through time to punch the child version of you in the stomach. I would maybe have given this film a 3, possibly even a 4...but the reason i've gone for a 1 is because I'm sick of all these failed remakes and reboots.",Ghostbusters
451,michaelseither,"Not a bomb, not a classic but not recommended",5,26 July 2016,"I wanted to see the latest version of Ghostbusters because of the who-ha that surrounded the release. Actually who-ha ensued prior to the release just based on rumor and casting. I wanted to like it because there is no reason talented people can't make a good movie switching gender roles from male to female. The actors involved are all talented and quite funny in other material. McCarthy, Wiig, Jones, McKinnon, they're all great. I could spend hours going over just how funny these people are and how much entertainment they've provided me. I am in awe. I also really didn't like the personal attacks, especially on Jones, who is funny, talented, well spoken and well, zany. She's a special talent and has the ability to command the screen whenever she's on it (SNL wise). It makes me sick to think people are still being attacked because of their race, size or any other physical characteristic that people want to jump on to belittle them. Not cool. So I really wanted to like this movie. Yeah, if you don't like the movie, you're sexist, etc., right? Right. AND revisionists have said that hey, the 1984 movie wasn't all that good anyway. Right? Anybody who has been overly critical of this movie's comparison to the original doesn't realize the original wasn't very good anyway. But no. My wife and I watched this one and went back and re-watched the original and no. This movie isn't very good and the original is charming and fun. There are many, many reasons for that but suffice it to say: No reason not to see this remake other than it isn't very good. If you are curious, go see it. I would recommend waiting until it comes out on DVD or to Netflix to satisfy your curiosity. Having said that, I would recommend anybody who didn't particularly like the movie to refrain from character assassination of the actors. They didn't write the script, direct or produce the effects. They hit the lines and said the words. Sometimes its magic and sometimes it ain't but god-bless them for trying.",Ghostbusters

Funny.There is a long string of positive reviews here but I am certain that these are made for political reasons. They are way, way too positive to be honest. I can believe it that some people might find this movie ""ok"" or ""worth a watch"" but it's literally impossible that anyone finds it a ""10/10"" and ""hilarious"".

I was dubious, wasn't a fan of the gimmick casting and thought the trailer was terrible, but the reviews have been decent and I wanted to give it a chance.Here's what's good: There are some genuine laughs. The film is clever and funny in a few spots. Kristen Wiig is mostly very winning, except when she's going looney over Chris Helmsworth, which is embarrassing for both of them.Mostly, though, the movie just sort of plods along, not boring and with some inventive ideas, but a lot of standard, tired dialog (""Let's do this!"", etc., etc.) and uneven performances. I love McKinnon best of all these actresses, but she's sooooo uneven here -- charming in a couple scenes, really hams it up elsewhere, feels forced and too theatrical overall. McCarthy does her schtick and I'm sick of it, Jones does as best she can with a thankless, typecast role. The grand finish is the worst part, pretty standard big budget fights, explosions, SFX, and so on. That started to get boring. But overall, i laughed more than I expected and I wasn't bored. I'd never see it again, though, either, so that puts it right in the middle of the pack, a 2-star movie, or a 5 on IMDb.",Ghostbusters

461,CraigsCritique,Complete Cinematic Indifference,5,17 July 2016,"Cut to a city wide climatic ghost battle in final act of the film where Kate McKinnon's character is tooled up with a variety of cool ghost battling weapons and that classic Ghostbusters music score is in full force whilst she dispatches ghost retribution and you go 'yes this is awesome' it's just a shame that was the only time I got really excited whilst watching this film.Yes I'm a massive fan of the original film but I'm one of the few who was actually hoping it would be positive and surprise me as too many people had criticized it before it even got onto our screens.Now having watched it I'm left in a state of complete indifference as to what I've just seen, a lot was made about the casting of this group of female actresses/comedians but the problem isn't the sex of our leads and more to the point of whether the film encapsulates the spirit of the original films and to another more simpler point of whether it's funny or not, with my overall input being 'it had it's moments' but it is in no way worthy of me shouting praise its way with it be just so inconsistent.Now I will admit I've had indifference with Paul Feig directed films before, I watched Bridesmaids after a lot of hype therefore I was always going to be left disappointed, on the other hand Spy really did surprise me with how much I enjoyed it, so I've had both ends of the scale, so maybe Paul Feig's, Kristen Wiig's and Melissa McCarthy's type of humour is not always going to appeal to me, it's interesting because I thought the pieces of humour that worked better were provided by Leslie Jones and Kate McKinnon, although even McKinnon had plenty that just didn't hit their mark. The Chris Hemsworth attractive idiot character was funny to a point but is was walking a shaky tightrope of gender ethics, I mean if it was a dumb but attractive woman in his place it would probably be derided in the media, but then again that situation has occurred way too many times at the expense of women in the history of cinema that you kind of almost forgive this representation of the beautiful idiot as a piece of retrospective (if unintentional) gender revenge.The film actually opened pretty well giving a great feel of the old films, the story narrative really isn't too dissimilar to the original and is actually pretty solid structurally but the question does have to be raised in regards to these reboots or sequels...if they are so similar to the original films why not go back to that source material and watch that instead? It's a harsh point of view but in the last year I've watched the likes of Jurassic World, Independence Day: Resurgence and now Ghostbusters with the thought of 'I really wish I was watching the original' and this is not because the new film was particularly bad but purely because it's constantly reminding you of them and how much you enjoyed them therefore creating the tone of indifference of which I talk about in reference to the films I mentioned.Talking about being reminded of the old film, I have to mention the cameos, was it me or did they just feel weird? I kind of expected the Dan Aykroyd one given the amount of effort he had exerted in trying to get a new Ghostbusters film to the screen but more confusing is the Bill Murray one which is really a small supporting part given he appears in two scenes during the film but I suppose I shouldn't try to understand the enigma that is Bill Murray.As I alluded to with my opening paragraph I feel this was without doubt a missed opportunity for the filmmakers to have made something that could have really connected with a sense of absurd blockbuster fun that was different from the plethora of superhero films that are currently dominating the cinematic landscape.So what do Ghostbusters (2016) and Independence Day: Resurgence share in common other than an acting Hemsworth brother?...my complete cinematic indifference.",Ghostbusters

Melissa can be funny, in some parts, but I just saw the same characters she plays in Bridesmaids, Tammy and Spy.Erin is trying way too hard to be funny. That's all I can say, she's too boring.Holtzmann was the best character of the film, she's cool, awesome and bad-ass.Paddy is just an African-American racist stereotype, always shouting and getting mad. Kevin is worst part of the film. Too unrealistically stupid. Chris Hemsworth is a great actor, but his acting was appalling.Most of the male characters are either dumb or jerks. The main villain is boring, and also a cliché.Ecto–1 and the Proton-Packs are probably the best part of the film. I love the weapons so much.The cameos was just a shoe-horned in there.It isn't an awful movie, but it was bit too tame. I think they should've done more risks in this movie.

The main thing is that the original cast were the funniest, and most loved people in the movie business in the 80s. These are theoretically the same people, but they are females. What's the big deal? They are as funny and loved as the original Ghostbusters. I recommend to all you haters to go see it and watch it as if there was never an original Ghostbusters and maybe you can enjoy it more.

Because it was crap.Apart from the special effects and cheap rate gags in it. It doesn't have a great deal going for it. Some of the original cast are in it, but they only play cameos along with other celebrities.A couple of things I did find funny was having Mr and Mrs Slimer driving Ecto 1 as well as the Marshmallow Man in the shape of a balloon.Don't get me wrong, I think having a female cast as the Ghostbusters isn't a bad idea. I felt as though it focus far too much on the comedy (asuming there was any) and far too much CGI. There was hardly any story, in fact it was just boring.My advice would be stick to the original Ghostbusters (1984) and Ghostbusters 2 (1989) and avoid this one like the plague.Harold Ramis must be turning in his grave and would properly rise from it as well, if he ever knew just how crap this one is.",Ghostbusters

The story is decent, again, it's a Ghostbusters movie, no plot twists, no oscar worthy scenes, just the girls hunting some ghosts.
I don't understand the hate, it's even produced by Dan Aykroyd and all the actors did a cameo, so it's good enough for them.
Luckily there was only one fart joke (I thought it was going to be plagued with them) and a couple of cringy jokes that failed to connect, but overall the humor in this one is good enough.It was a funny ride, just another decent comedy to relax your brain and eat some popcorn.",Ghostbusters
467,Kosinus,Thank god: not a sequel!,6,10 August 2016,"The more you know the less you can enjoy... So let's watch this movie being completely ignoring the past...We get a great opening, a nice plot, some cool visual, good music, good laughs, a catchy movie from the first to the very last second. Quite entertaining!My biggest problem with it? The media and marketing! All the trailers I had seen would have prevented me from watching this one. Clips felt boring and forced and cold. Same goes for reviews and interviews... It's like this project was doomed to not stand on its own feet.In detail: The acting feels often wooden and the timing overstretched. Maybe the director was aiming at the the cast's stand-up qualities? Too much ad lib? The development of the main plot was a little under motivated. Questions like ""why?"" or ""how?"" shouldn't be asked. So the final act falls behind its visuals...Something about taste: All female cast + Kevin... maybe overdone, maybe done just right. Up until here, the movie could easily deserve a 7/10!Now let's include our memories of the old ones: Many things and motives are simply similar to the old movies, so you can't help but to get a ""been there done that""-feeling... maybe this justifies the tone of the all female cast and ""Kevin"". Since there are so many things that have to be repeated, why not focus on other aspects of the group dynamics. Accepting this, many of the negative reviews simply fade away as a bare expression of taste mixed with the unwillingness for an open mind. People hate exactly two things: when something changes and when nothing changes at all. ;) All cameos felt just right and I enjoyed them all! Though I cannot help it but to feel that Bill Murray simply hated being involved. Still I loved his part. Paranormal cameos: also nice!Still one of the better movies I watched this year!Let's express some hope here: Maybe this was just a story to kick off some franchise so the story and motives will be explained in a sequel... maybe there is a good explanation for Kevin, too?

What I couldn't deal with it is the awful dialogue or treating men like either huge a-holes or giant morons. I don't recall Annie Pots being treated that way in the original, I guess Hollywood is much crueler to men than they are to women. Oh well...maybe there will be a sequel with a real plot. But based on this CRAPFEST, I doubt it. There is just no way this can get good reviews from critics. Also, how racist is it to have the same stupid black stereotype in 2016.",Ghostbusters
470,Fiurilli,A mediocre summer comedy,4,15 July 2016,"The reboot of the famous 1984 movie 'Ghostbusters' stars Melissa McCarthy, Kate McKinnon, Kristen Wiig and Leslie Jones who over the course of the first act get together and form a crew called 'The Ghostbusters'. With a few special weapons and the well known Proton- Beam they have to work together to hunt down and capture ghosts. Working together is what the main characters do fairly well. Although the acting is a bit rough at times the four ghostbusters all seemed very likable and in my opinion they did have some good chemistry going on between them. The other characters in the movie are pretty dispensable however as they are mostly there for a quick joke. The ghosts they're hunting were fairly well crafted however with a cartoon-ish design while also looking fairly menacing. Accompanying the ghosts were some well placed jump scares, though at it's core 'Ghostbusters' is of course still a comedy movie. The comedic side is sadly not that good as a lot of the jokes fell flat. Occasionally there were some gags that made me audibly chuckle though often times these jokes were later on repeated multiple times without achieving the same effect.The overarching plot is decent enough and it would've allowed for a fun story to be told, though due to the poor writing what is left is a very predictable story with a downright ridiculous villain whose sole purpose is to set the necessary events in motion. Overall the 'Ghostbusters' reboot wasn't the train wreck some people though it'd be, but sadly it also wasn't the great comedy movie other people hoped it'd be.My rating: 4/10",Ghostbusters

Surprised to learn initially that it was going to be an all female cast and not a sequel. Thought the trailers were OK but anticipated the special effects were going to be decent. Just came home finished watching it. I know there are a ton of bad user reviews, but I'm sorry, I loved it, I thought it was a great summer blockbuster movie. I thought the script/story was excellent, I thought most of the jokes were very funny. It wasn't just me it was the whole theater and that's how I know that was the honest genuine reaction. The special effects were even more amazing than I thought it would be, especially the ghosts and weaponry, wow. I love the ending of the story as well I thought that was a cool ending. I love the cast and especially Wiig and McKinnon who were very funny. Wiig plays a brilliant straight man to McKinnon and McCarthy's wackiness.As a boy growing up I loved the franchise, the movies, the cartoons the toys. I've watched many times the original with my kids. But I'm really proud to have brought them to see this one, especially for my little girl. She got to watch a sci-fi action comedy with a female cast, a very positive impression it will have for her to see strong female characters in this kind of genre as the heroes.

478,pailoong,Ignore the high ratings...,1,17 July 2016,"SJW's are known for banding together on social media sites to try and push their agenda's, and that is exactly what is happening here. One ""reviewer"" even tried to out-SJW the others by saying this abomination was ""better than the original"". Give me a break! Anyway, to the review... to be honest, I don't believe it ruined the Ghostbusters franchise. I feel the second film started the decline (come on, it was really boring and cheesy) and the slew of soulless marketing after that (the cartoon, for example) ruined the franchise. The first film is rare and special. This film is merely a continuation of the decline in quality this series has suffered.Because of all the horrendous and offensive stereotypes this film contains (this has been discussed at length on many other reviews here so I won't repeat them), this film would've worked better as a parody. Think back to ""Scary Movie"" and its sequels: full of offensive stereotypes, but they were funny because making fun of the stereotypes and clichés was the whole point. This film falls flat on its face in all regards because it's been demanded by feminist's and SJW's that we take it seriously. Because of this, it is impossible to separate the politics from this film and as a result that's all it is: a failed socio-political statement.This kind of dreck is below the likes of Melissa McCarthy. I ADORED her on ""Mike and Molly"" and have enjoyed some of her film work. I thought she was funny, likable and relatable (and I catch the reruns of M&M whenever I can), but this... this is like finding Monet in a landfill.My review of the film can be summed up in the following: horrible acting, zero plot, non-existent comedy (shooting a ghost in the groin to kill it. Really?), dumb stereotypes... just about what you would expect from a film whose sole premise is ""gender-swapped Ghostbusters"".

My main issue was just with Hollywood doing the whole remake thing again, because I hate the lame desperation of that. I love women so again I didn't mind all-ladies on the team. I wasn't even sure if I was going to watch the film anyway because I didn't really care that much. The casting left me kind of cold when they officially revealed who would be in it. No one had me jumping for joy, not even Chris Hemsworth's casting. When I watched the trailer, I said this on YouTube : ""I'm not crying in a corner, but I'm not doing the Carlton dance either"". It felt ""Meh"". And that's how the movie felt to me. I'm not even 30 years old, so the original film is obviously before my time. But I have seen the '84 original, and I admire it although I'm not in love with it. I was surprised at the time when watching it at how scary it was at times. And the humor wasn't forced. Here in the '16 remake, it is very much the opposite or it either drags at times. And it's not funny or scary. I laughed at something that Leslie Jones said when she was talking to the police after their encounter with the villain. Only laugh in the movie for me, and it wasn't even that funny. The villain in this movie is one of the worst I've seen. Pathetic even. I thought the four leads were ok, but Leslie Jones' character was actually my favorite. Hemsworth was ok as the idiot receptionist. And I don't fault the actor who played the antagonist, but the material he had did not serve him well whatsoever. And that new theme?! They may as well have just used the original one because the new one is garbage. I don't think all of the hate towards the cast was by any means necessary, but neither was this film.

482,gricey_sandgrounder,"Despite the awful marketing, it ended up feeling like a Ghostbusters film",7,11 July 2016,"I am actually amazed at how many people see the 1984 original as one of the best movies of all-time. It's a good fun film with a few laughs, nothing more. In fact, the sequel is probably as the good as its predecessor in my opinion.As for this re-make, many of you know that the build-up and marketing for this film has gone pretty bad to say the least. With every trailer and TV spot not showing much promise and new theme song being ripped to shreds. A lot of people are giving this film so much hate, that they are not even going to see it and give it a chance.I will have to agree that I have not liked what I have seen either. The main things is the comedy, the gags did not make me laugh at all and had me shaking my head. Some of the casting did not give me much promise. When I say casting, I do not mean because they are female. That being said, I went into the screening with an open mind like I do with all my films. And you know what, it was all right.The opening scene brings in you in nicely and gives the film some promise. The early character development is pretty solid and I was found the characters believable in their aims and what they wanting out of this. It moves a long nicely, even with some bits not quite working. I remained keen to see how the film would end and it was a pleasant final act.The main thing going into what is a comedy, is to see whether it will make you laugh. For me, I laughed I would say fairly steadily throughout the film. Yes, some gags did not work, but some did. Thankfully the ones that didn't, did not make me shake my head in disgust. It just did not work for me. The good stuff did make me chuckle, and I was surprised at the amount of movie references it made which pleased me.The writing is probably its strongest positive. It is sharp, it's witty at times and there is a lot of nice science tech talk like I remember the original Ghostbusters having, which I was not expecting.The performances were pretty solid from every department and the chemistry worked fairly well. Melissa McCarthy and Kristen Wiig might not have been stand-outs, but they were certainly solid leads. McCarthy toned down the McCarthy most people associate with her, and we get a good team leader. Kate McKinnon might not have totally fulfilled my hopes from what I saw of her in the trailer. But I still was entertained by her character. She does get a bit over-the-top. But it was a pretty transition from her works on TV. From what I can tell, it is a pretty hard skill to move from TV into film. Everything about Leslie Jones in the trailer was all one note and very annoying, and I did not think she would go anywhere. Amazingly, she is not annoying. Yes, there are moments that would have liked to get rid of. But I thought she felt like a valuable part of the team. I never thought I would actually type that about Leslie Jones.Chris Hemsworth was really funny in it. He definitely has the best gags. They were so silly and random and yet very clever and well delivered. Some are just silly, went too far and did not work. But the majority of them were great. I must mention that there is a lot of cameos in this, and in more ways than one. There are cameos of actors/characters from the original, references to quotes from the film. Some worked well, some didn't, and some were just truly awful. Even at times, they looked forced and it made the film's pace slow down. It is almost as if the studio told them to put one in every 15 minutes. I don't mind there being cameos. However, if they had toned that down a bit, they might have made the film stand alone by itself.But thankfully, it is by far not the worst thing I have seen this year. The story was perfectly fine and felt like a Ghostbusters film. It was well developed, you knew exactly what was going on and it made me interested to see how it would conclude. To those many haters that are boycotting it. Go and see it as it is a solid film, and with it being released in a summer where the big budget films have not lived up to anything, it is certainly one of the more memorable ones.One thing that I certainly was not expecting was how they constructed the end credits. In fact, this could be a landmark moment for how big budget films conduct their credits. Most do fancy graphics for the first portion of the credits, and then the rest is just a black background and rolling text. Ghostbusters managed to make the whole credits segment worth watching. From a visual standpoint, it did something really interesting with the credits, that I hope a lot of future blockbuster films take on board.Speaking of credits, there is a post-credits scene. It is certainly interesting. But I think it is gone down the route of many re-makes, which was a shame. However, I will be intrigued to see where they go with it.Rating: 7/10",Ghostbusters

484,mother_of_popcorn,Fun Remake Not To Be Taken Too Seriously,8,25 July 2016,"So I have a confession to make. I only saw the original 1984 film a couple of days before I saw this remake of Ghostbusters. This means I may not have has as much of an attachment to the original as other people who grew up with it did. Having said that, seeing the trailer prior to seeing the movie definitely piqued my interest. Supernatural beings, Kristen Wiig, Melissa McCarthy and with Paul Feig at the helm, I knew this movie was going to be right up my alley.This is one very rare instance of when a remake of a movie actually brings something new to the table. With visual effects that make the ghosts look creepier than ever, teamed with an all-girl team of butt- kicking 'busters and a very handsome (but not-so-bright) secretary in the form of Chris Hemsworth, you can't help but enjoy this movie. It has the right amount of laughs, right amount of action and the right amount of cameos (no spoilers here, you'll have to see it for yourself).After the success of this one, I won't be surprised if a sequel has already been greenlit. This is a movie that lends itself to both older and younger generations alike. Fans of the original will appreciate the various nods and references that they can relate to and the younger audience can experience the joys the older fans felt over 30 years ago.motherofpopcorn.wordpress.com",Ghostbusters
485,barryweir,"Not the worst thing ever, but not great.",4,10 October 2016,"First, I think everyone needs to ignore the online reviews that give this movie one star or nine or ten stars. The majority are from those determined to hate it and their counterparts. In reality this is neither the worst or the best movie ever.This is not as good as the original. Those who say it is do not appreciate what was special about the original. The humour was more dry and the film wasn't an out and out comedy, instead mixing in elements of drama, sci-fi, horror and fantasy. It was unique and couldn't be pigeon-holed, which is the secret of it's success and enduring fandom. I'd say this picture probably lies alongside 1989's Ghostbusters II in terms of quality.What of the main drama? Femmebusters? Well, I have to say that I never had an issue with female Ghostbusters. I do however have an issue with how this played out. For one I don't care for the two main casting choices. Wiig, and especially McCarthy, are Feig's go to choices. I'm sorry but I just don't think they are that talented, especially the latter. When McCarthy is on screen she is just the same as in all her other movies and the site of her in the Ghostbusters costume felt like I was watching a middle aged housewife playing ""let's pretend"". I know the SNL link, but I would've preferred more skilled actresses in the two main roles rather than Feig's usual go to people. Jones and McKinnon are okay, albeit I found McKinnon as time ticked on.The biggest problem IMO is the overt laziness in the construction of the film. Feig admits that the movie did not grow organically. Rather he wanted the gimmick of four women and the rest would then be built around it. It shows. The plot is a lazy rehash of the first movie. The team, three white scientists and a black blue collar worker - check. Library ghost that establishes ghosts are real - check. Secretary with glasses - check. First major bust a green ghost in a public venue - check. A big white ghost walking through Manhattan - check. Crossing the streams - check. Ectomobnile - check. Slimer - check. Proton packs, etc - check. Similar uniforms - check. Imagine for a second this wasn't an all female cast and that aspect wasn't dominating the headlines. What are you left with? One of the laziest remakes in recent history. Hell, Feig even said he rebooted it because he was too lazy to address the notion of a world already familiar with ghosts.Then there's the misandry. Paul Feig said in an interview a while back that the reason he makes female centric films is because he likes women more than men. This, he says, stems from being bullied by boys when at school. Feig claims his movies are nonetheless about female equality. Well I call bull. The man clearly hasn't got over his childhood and this is his way of sticking it to those he hated as a boy. Every male character in this picture is an idiot. The script is littered with sly digs at men (the angry ghosts being ""mostly dudes"", to give one example). Then there's the deliberate poking at the fans of the franchise by stereotyping ""fanboys"" as virginity harbouring, basement dwelling losers. Hell even the main villain is depicted as an angry nerd. I had a real problem with this as in real life I know three such people, ranging from 30s to 60s and in all three cases they suffer from deep lying mental health issues, be it anxiety, depression or deep insecurity. People are like that for a reason and it is often not something to be mocked and ridiculed because it can be due to their upbringing, bullying, health or whatever else. That Feig trivialises such things while playing out his own childhood grudges is particularly offensive and laced with irony. I was unaware that promoting women involved degrading men, as Feig seems to think.So, is there anything good about the movie? I didn't find the humour my kind of humour, but overall I'm sure some would laugh. It wasn't ""groan out loud"" terrible. Plus, while still present, Feig managed to tone down the crass humour from his previous efforts. Also, with the exception of the end movie villain, I found the ghost effects well done. I think many of the ghost effects afforded the film a credibility that was otherwise lacking. Finally, if you can overlook at lot of the complaints I have highlighted above then the movie is reasonably well paced and does have enough entertaining moments that it's passable as Sunday afternoon entertainment.However, this movie had two objectives. One was to restart the franchise, the other to make a statement about strong women. It fails on both counts. It has upset long term fans, while undermining it's female leads with a lazy remake and unnecessary misandry. I can't help feel a sense of irony that the movie has a cameo from one of the earliest modern era tough girls in Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver). There's an example of a strong female role model done right. Plus, even in the modern era, franchises like Star Wars and Star Trek show us that you can have strong female leads without massive controversy. Quite simply, the whole sexism row has become an excuse not to have to examine why this project ultimately comes up short. The irony is that because of that row, the only way to truly have a view of this project is to watch it yourself and form your own opinion.",Ghostbusters

I'm so impressed to see how many people strongly hated it. In my humbly opinion, the movie successfully recreates the magic, the fun and also the atmosphere of the original back in 1984. The choice to replace the main male protagonist with female ones sounded controversial to me but I was surprised to see how the four female protagonists standed up well eith their good performances and humor. Only 2 things I hated in this movie: 1-Chris Hemsworth's character's Kevin Beckman (he's way too dumb. Only few of his jokes are funny). 2- The too many references to the original movie (even the story can be too familiar with the first movie). The visuals are very interesting but not as spooky as the original movie, and the action sequences are very well directed. The humor is solid but sometimes is fleeble. Many jokes and gags are funny and family-friendly, othe jokes are weak, dirt and some other even sexist.

But his character could have been played just as convincingly by a stump.And of course we had to have the ""designated fat ugly nerd"", the ""desperate and clueless"", and a few other tropes.Basically, if it wasn't a stereotype, it was a trope. The ""great CGI"" was all stolen from the originals, as was the plot and what few jokes that weren't based on blatant sexism or racism.

494,rich-874-542858,"Fun, but a needless faux-reboot",4,26 July 2016,"It's tough to be disappointed with something when you don't have high expectations. Overall, I found the film to be fun escapism and feel that if it existed in its own right (no previous GB) then it would actually be half decent. The cast do a sterling job of their roles, and with more character development they could be really endearing. We can't forget that there wasn't much in the way of character development in the first GB, especially for Winston...However, it's impossible to escape the shadow of the 1984 movie,and as such the apple has fallen very far from the tree. The humour is dumbed down, overt and appeals to the lowest common denominator. They may as well have put explanatory subtitles on screen for the amount of time they spent flogging the dead horse with some of the jokes.Not that I'm a prude, I enjoy a lot of childish humour, but the success of the 1984's comedy was that it was subtle, delivered in deadpan and required a bit of thinking. That has been lost in this version.Yes, times have changed, comedy has changed and audiences have changed. I get that. But it consistently feels disrespectful to the source material, from which it is extremely derivative (not just the concept).I'm still scratching my head as to why they felt the need to ""reboot"" it at all, and which part of it was actually a reboot? It couldn't make its mind up whether it was a reboot or a homage or a continuation of the original series. Yes you can't get rid of the concept and the tools that are synonymous with the film, but at least think of a different origin story, fundamental plot and distance it entirely from the original? The film feels like a tour through a Ghostbusters museum, revisiting key locations, cameos by ghostly characters and original cast (which in the case of the male actors just felt really, really sad). It was almost like they were ticking off a checklist of references to make so that it could still be ""accepted"". I was especially disappointed by the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man cameo - it missed the point entirely of that character's involvement in the original.I thought there were some interesting concepts in this film, and I'd have preferred to see more development of them. For instance, some of the ghosts being introduced in the third act, the back story to Wiig's character and why she believed in ghosts could've been a really interesting thread to pull on. I'd also liked to have understood more about the villain's motivation, his back story and actually what he intended to achieve (frankly that wasn't especially clear).The third act felt too much like a ""girl power"" statement rather than a believable scenario in which people are fighting the paranormal and genuinely afraid. Whilst I liked McKinnon's character for the most part, she felt like a caricature by the third act (licking her pistols was just too far).The original was never about ""boy power"", quite the opposite. There was always a feeling throughout the film that they were constantly second-guessing themselves and out of their depth, and their final villain was genuinely a force to be reckoned with because there was some development long before it appeared on screen. For that reason I feel like it lost focus.I don't want to be totally negative about the film. I realise that, like GB2, they wanted to make it more child-friendly to appeal to a broader audience. For that reason, it will never have the scathing subtleties of the first.There were some good moments. I did especially enjoy Chris Hemsworth's character, probably because we're so used to seeing him in strong leadership roles, and you could tell he was having a ball. The CGI was effective in most places and some of the ghosts were actually menacing, although the extent of their menace seems restricted to vomiting slime over everyone. Despite largely reverting to loud sassy black lady stereotype, Leslie Jones was still endearing. Kristen Wiig was just Kristen Wiig but thankfully, McCarthy wasn't playing the tomboy Pam Bouvier-from-Archer character she normally plays.If they do a sequel, which they seemed to gear up for at the end, it would be nice to see more character development in both the living and the dead.",Ghostbusters

496,huey2088,Who you gonna call - feminists.,5,6 October 2016,"It seems to me that remake or reboot movies these days have one common formula in particular. Borrow heavily the memorable bits from the original and run with it. Also it doesn't hurt if you can get cameos thrown in.I don't hate this Ghostbusters reboot, nor am I gushing all over it. I like the female leads with funny, quirky jokes. Wiig and McCarthy are great together. Jones and McKinnon stole the show though. The CGI is high quality. It took time to explain the dense scientific ideas and there is a wonderful scene where new ghostbusting gadgets are being tested. Getting the original cast involved was also smart although I thought Murray and Weaver looked like they couldn't wait for their cameos to end ASAP.Here is what I don't like and I'm a feminist. The whole put down of men just seem rather below the belt. Literally - aka when the female Ghosbusters aim their proton beams at the giant ghost crushing his way through NYC. It was their last resort to take down the spectre by shooting at his crotch.Then there is Hemsworth's character who is the brainless receptionist with an incredible body. I have no idea why he is even in it except for his own publicity. Unlike Potts who was the dodgy but funny original receptionist, Hemsworth is just not funny at all. Also she didn't try so hard during her screen time like Hemsworth nor did she close the ending credit with some dance moves in a tight T -shirt.I get it that in this politically correct, post feminist age, women can do anything that men can. I just don't think using female aggression to emasculate men is the solution. If it wanted to make an important point that the original movie was sexist because how the female roles were portrayed, then director Feig has gone about it wrongly. I hate to say it but the original Ghostbusters is a cult because it was fun and had great acting that didn't rely on CGI. It was suspenseful. I didn't analyse the original like some have done and called it misogynist. It was filmed in a time when directors had more freedom to develop their ideas without backlash from the mass in the form of social media. Nowadays, there is gender equality, political correctness, racial sensitivity to consider in every aspect of life. And the movies are meant to be a form of escapism - pure entertainment without someone criticising it too death and encouraging other to do the same.If you don't agree with some messages in movies or get offended by some directors' choices, remember, no one forced you to watch it. After the closing credits fade, it's time to get back to the real issues in life, preferably one without too many screens.",Ghostbusters

You could see them coming, predictable, and no surprises. Second, none of the characters were a ""straight man"" or voice of reason. Every single star had to try and make jokes. A ""normal"" or non-joking character makes any comedy funnier. Case in point, the original Ghostbusters.

I wasn't. This movie's plot is so thin they can use it to slice an atom in half. Aside from the blatant sexism, showing men as shallow one-dimensional characters, there are plenty of other things to dislike here. I am all for silly comedies when everyone is a caricature, but this one was designed to apparently somehow ""empower"" women by putting down men. but enough about this aspect.None of the characters are in any way relatable. They just do their thing because the script says so. There is hardly any backstory to any of them (aside from a feeble attempt to give some background to the main character's ghost-enthusiast past turned scientist. Yet it goes nowhere, since her scientific knowledge is never again used, but instead is delegated to the blond sociopath who cannot seem to decide whether her character should be rude, brilliant, offensive, endearing, or psychotic. There is no explanation how and why Leslie's character decides to join the bunch aside from ""having a ride"".There is a bunch of callbacks to the original films but they all end up being profoundly unoriginal. ""don't cross the streams"", and ""we don't have a proper containment unit for the ghosts"" and ""slimer"", etc. Speaking of slimer, now apparently all ghosts leave vast amounts of goo, not just him, making his name completely redundant. There is not a single original concept in this aside from a couple of new gadgets that are better fitting in a James Bond movie.

504,philpriestley,Good family entertainment - ignore the internet snobs and faux-intellectuals,7,18 July 2016,"I read reviews of this movie before I took my two sons (5 and 9) to see it at the cinema this weekend.The reviews that I read promised it would be diabolical rubbish - with suggestions of rife gender politics, race discrimination and flat jokes that don't work. Some people have taken the time to say that this new film offends the laws of continuity and generally the sensibilities of anyone who loves the franchise. I'm glad to say that I didn't listen to such snobbery.This is not an intellectual film and it's not an intellectual franchise. Nobody goes to Ghostbusters III expecting a didactic on gender politics. Nobody is going stand up in parliament and point to Ghostbusters III as the foundation of a sensible gender dialogue. Anyone who genuinely feels offended by this movie needs to take a long hard look at their sense of humour.Ghostbusters III is a 'reboot' movie - I think they could've easily made this a sequel/spin off - but they chose to go to 'reboot' - perhaps not my preference, but it's OK.Let me tell you my acid test for this movie - my five year old loved it. He watched it on the edge of his seat from start to finish. He cheered when Stay Puffed and Slimer appeared. He spotted some - but not all - of the cameo appearances and got excited by that too. He enjoyed the special effects and laughed at some of the jokes. At no point did he get scared, and he left the movie theatre singing the Ghostbuster song.Tell me that is a movie that is worthy of two stars? My nine year old also enjoyed it, but not as much - but he laughed and he smiled and didn't get bored.For me, I particularly liked the cameos on offer - they were great. Ray, Spengler, Jannine and so on all took a turn to wink at the camera and give us a nod.The special effects are great too. It goes to the next level.OK - the funnies aren't going to make you require stitches - but let's be honest the original Ghostbusters wasn't ever a balls out comedy either, and managed to get by on a few regular chuckles. This is the same really.It's the dry observational stuff that you expect from Melissa McCarthy - it's a shame that there wasn't a bit more opportunity for her to just riff around a bit, because she is very good at that - but the script held together and it never got too much like a pantomime (which is tough when you're doing a comedy ghost movie).It's nice that the film was dedicated to Harold Ramis too - the only significant character (outside of Rick Moranis) who wasn't there to say hello in some way.Some pencil sharpener somewhere will tell you that the voltage wasn't correct on the proton screen or something - this s**t is not real folks!

But instead, with the politically-charged writing and poor characters, this movie failed to impress. The CGI was solid, and the performances were great, but it all fell apart in the script. The only character that felt like an actual Ghostbuster was Kate McKinnon's character, Jillian Holtzmann. Sure, she was over-the-top at times and she might've seemed a bit... absent-minded, but she was a solid character that was fun to watch on screen. I can only hope she can get on board with the next entry in the franchise.
Of course, this movie saved itself with the third act. I was going to give it a much lower rating with the poor jokes and slow pacing, but the third act was genuinely entertaining. It wasn't enough to make this more than an average film, but it does keep it from being a truly bad one.

Well OK, it has a little to do with it, but not for the reasons one would think.The main problem comes down to the puerile, low-brow, and painful attempts at humour. This would be bad enough as they were - if the jokes weren't made by fully grown women. I don't know about other people, but it's typically little boys who tell these sorts of jokes, and in THAT context it could have been funny. In this context - I'm sorry - it just isn't at all. It comes off as awkward and sad and not funny in the slightest. Chris Hemsworth has perhaps the funniest line in the film, and perhaps the only funny line in the film, and it's because he's a man that the joke works.Secondly, there is no real horror in this film. If you're going to have a ghosts, there needs to be horror that needs to be somewhat believable. Here, we've got something akin to ""Goosebumps"" and ""Scary Movie"" horror with blatant CGI overkill. In other words it's not genuinely creepy or scary at all, and it doesn't take itself even remotely seriously. The ghosts in this movie do not pose a genuine threat. This means that the levity of comedy - even if the attempts at humor here were even slightly funny - would have had absolutely no impact regardless.Thirdly, this film takes a huge dump all over it's classic source material. It's the most cynical cash grab imaginable to even attempt a ""remake"" and then go ahead and make something worse, throwing out all the lore of the original films as if they never existed. The director does not even seem to fully understand what made the original film work as well as it did. There are cameos by some of the original cast members, but they are all completely wasted. Bill Murray was the best thing about the original 1984 film and his talents go completely unused in his cameo here.Even with some decent plot ideas, there's no saving it from being pointless. It's aimed at an idiotic audience who would find Friedberg and Seltzer movies funny. In fact this film has little to no redeeming features to even be worth watching.

Not spectacular, but they carry the film. I wish Kate McKinnon would have toned it down a notch, she really seems to have a need to steal the scene and it becomes annoying.Helmsworth (Thor) makes the movie however. The actor & writers did a pretty good job on that character, and justifies the price of an early matinée showing. I would say that I laughed harder during his scenes than any point of either of the two original films.Is the film misandrist? Yes. But considering the history of misanthropy throughout the past hundred years of Hollywood, I'll give it a pass. The film isn't bad by any means. I even put it into the halfway-decent range. People giving it one-star are being disingenuous. Some parts are pretty good, and other parts are not so good (the Bill Murray green screen cameo should have been left on the cutting room floor).

It's a poorly made rehash of the old Movie, without any of the humour, with ridiculously low quality cgi compared to the effects of the original, and actors whose talent doesn't reach the toenails of those in the original. This Movie made me ask myself, how did Melissa McCarthy become an actor? And Kristen Wiig? Between the two of them they have less talent than a bag of rocks, and are slightly less funny. Wiig should stick to doing voices for ""SpongeBob""-characters.If they wanted to make something original, they should have spent a few cents on an actual script. Perhaps cooked up a story about the daughters of the original Ghostbusters continuing the legacy or some-such connection. It could easily have been made into a good story.

I laughed twice in the film 2. I was fine with the look of the ghosts and gadgets, the CGI people are having fun and are compensating for Feigs' lack of directorial skill. 4. Slimer was great and used appropriately and I didn't mind his Girlfriend at all. 5. The horror parts were effective and handled with respect. Now to the bad stuff...I am incredibly surprised at the lack of jokes. When there ARE jokes, they are repeated too many times and go on for 3 times what they should due to actors improv e.g Hemsworth covering his eyes, the spitting coffe, wontons, the ""body in the back of the car"" scene, the ""Cat out of the bag"" scene and the Patrick Swayze bit. When they aren't doing repetitive jokes, they are doing old, stale ones you've seen a million times before, including crotch shots, a man screaming like a woman, middle finger jokes, low blood sugar jokes and fart/queef jokes. I also hate this ""stating the obvious"" humour where the actors spell out the jokes after said joke is complete, not only do those happen literally dozens of times, but there are at LEAST a dozen unfunny movie references, not through visuals (Feig is a terrible visual director, he is honestly one of the least talented and unambitious directors in Hollywood) but through the actors mentioning films from the past as if that will earn them brownie points. The reviews praised McKinnon and Hemsworth, but I honestly found them the worst parts. McKinnon's Mugging to the camera reminded me of a teenage guy trying to make his friends laugh in a school drama skit. Hemsworth's is the dumb character we've seen on every bad TV comedy in the last 40 years, yet somehow worse. I found myself pretty bored due the excruciatingly slow pace. There are far too many scenes where the pacing is thrown out because the editors keep chucking in out-of-place improvisations, couldn't decide which ones were best, so they kept them all in. The villain is just a walking blob of exposition. Not only is it contrived that he doesn't just kill all the GBs in one click of his fingers, but he chooses the form of the destructor? This confuses me because they want Gozer in the next film. The music wasembarrassing, when it wasn't cookie cutter score, it was horrific covers of the ghostbusters theme. The cameos were all bland and didn't add to the film, though Murray's obvious lack of enthusiasm was wonderful to watch. The ending was a mess, it was overblown, impossible CGI schlock that reminded me of Superman 64, where the developers just surrounded everything in smoke so they didn't have to animate anything complex. It looked like Feig was trying too hard to do the whole ""GURL POWER"" thing and forgot to add humour to his action scenes like an Edgar Wright or a Miller/Lord film would. The film also ends almost mid-sentence on Ernie Hudson's cameo but then the film carries on during the credits when it could have easily had those beforehand? I am honestly baffled that this less than average broad comedy got a 73% on RT, yet I guess I can't be too surprised when trash like ""The Night Before"" and ""Central Intelligence"" get good reviews. If you look at this film objectively, it lacks any ambition or originality.

Sure, not every gag lands as intended, but generally speaking the concoction of SNL alumni and current cast members have wicked chemistry, which is only further enhanced but the unexpected comedy chops of Chris Hemsworth as hapless secretary 'Kevin' (just one of many very welcome – and successful - attempts to comment upon cultural stereotyping and general ignorance which the film is so evidently aware of).Kate McKinnon is a particular treat, closely followed by a solid lead performance by Kristen Wiig; but the real cherry on top here is the film's own self-awareness and meta nature; in which director Paul Feig actively incorporates real-life hatred directed towards his (inexplicably) controversial reboot, into the fictional story to hilarious effect (""Ain't no bitches gonna hunt no ghosts"").",Ghostbusters

Loveable characters, some laugh out loud lines, a good baddie and great cameos by old favorites.

518,SomeGuyName,The only honest review,5,6 June 2017,"Even though this review is called the only honest review, I am sure that the majority of people here are going to agree deep down, a sort of summing up the general experience.I'll start out by saying that I am tired of the political stigma surrounding this movie - I don't give a rat's ass about most of the stuff people choose to be offended about, so I'll just steer clear of that. In this way, I am probably like most guys on IMDb, so I am confident that this will reflect the user base. And just to be clear, I not in no way bothered by the fact that it is women who play the major roles in this movie - it's just that men play all the minor ones. Also, they tend to be portrayed as downright stupid, or they only say silly stuff, which is not very common when we're speaking of a comedy. This was slightly harrowing to me, and I can only describe the experience by using the term 'reverse sexism', a choice of words which clearly shows how little I care when the 'ism's are directed at anything other than what is white and male. (otherwise, I would know that the correct term is simply 'sexism').The acting sucked, even though I usually like Kristen Wiig. I'd say that Chris Hemsworth saved the movie and should be the lead actor in the next Ghostbusters, where they will make America great again. The music and CGI was fine, though I was a bit bothered by all of the neon lights. I wasn't alive when the original Ghostbusters came out, but it was truly a masterpiece that I of course cared about way before I saw all the headlines advertising a ""female Ghostbusters"". The plot was a bit meandering, and I probably wasn't the only one who was a bit bored by the time they got to portray the villain as a male basement dwelling nerd. All in all a sour experience. Look up the ratings for this movie, and you will see how it was subjected to a down voting brigade before it even came out in theaters,(I'd tell you the password to my 4chan account if it wouldn't put me in immediate danger, as I am very proud of my contribution to keep the SJWs from taking over the world) and now, the ratings are slowly being re-balanced. Worrying, it is. If only people could take entertainment for what it is, huh?",Ghostbusters

It has its tongue firmly in its cheek as it makes reference to the schlock from the first film. There are some fun cameos from Bill Murray etc. and Chris Hemsworth hamming it up over the closing credits is a hoot. Far from ""spoiling my childhood"", this remake brought back fond memories of the original. You'd have to have to be very insecure to think that this remake is going to ruin your enjoyment of the original. That said, maybe this modern version *will* make people recall the flaws in the original (of which there were many) and think more poorly of that - which would of course mean that they should rate this new version more highly. Anyway, haters gonna hate :) Go see it, if only because the internet trolls don't want you to, but also because you will really enjoy yourself.",Ghostbusters

Remember Peter Sellers in the Pink Panther series and then Steve Martin in the remake? Was that a gasp?! Perfect! Roll the credits. See them projected on the inside of your eyelids.

521,Blackbird013-1,Surprisingly good,7,28 October 2016,"I think this is best described as a remake. It varies from the original in quite a few ways while keeping with the original concept.The main characters are a bit different, the plot is a little different, and the results may vary. It's different enough to entertain people that already watched the original while allowing the general concept to be translated to a more ""modern"" audience.I would like to point out that many of the complaints I have read in reviews point to particular details that mirrored the first film, and seemed along with cameo appearances to remind viewers of the original film while staying true to it with a completely new story.I'm intentionally being vague here, but most of us know what Ghostbusters was (bordering on the offensive). If why things in this film seem so true to the first isn't clear to you, maybe you should go back and watch it with fresh modern eyes. Ghostbusters (the original) was made as a wild comedy. While not liking everything done or the way it was done I personally think this modern remake was rather amusing and stayed true to the spirit of the original.Without giving it a top rating, I definitely think it deserves more credit than I've seen in reviews. The most shocking part was how much I liked it in spite of so many people writing hateful reviews. While in no way approaching the brilliance of the original it's definitely a lot better than you would expect after reading so many bad reviews. In so many ways it seemed like a brilliant parallel story.If I could point out just one serious flaw...characters. The original had Dana who was a serious musician and a likable character. Spengler from the original was a serious (yet possibly wacky) scientist with a sort of dry humor. Without any reliable characters to latch onto maybe it was harder for people to ""get it"". The intended parallel nature was obvious, but in the sense of characters things just seemed a bit scrambled.",Ghostbusters
522,elskootero-1,"A typically B A D Feminist remake, as they usually are.",1,9 August 2016,"As bad as this movie is, you'd swear that Gloria Steinem; Gloria Allred; Carly Fiorina and Hillary Clinton co-produced and co-directed it. It is quite simply a very B A D movie. It tries so hard to be as good as the original, but that's what kills it. It would be like making a film about the Battle of Gettysburg with women in all the lead roles. Women simply are NOT as funny as men, and this awful film proves it. It SUCKS! Maybe a different type of film might have succeeded, but this one died!~ Changing the sex of the stars of a classic old film is usually the kiss of death, anyway.

523,alan_holloway_2,Bustin' Will Make You Feel Good,8,11 July 2016,"Are you afraid of ghosts? I suppose most people would be, but lately it seems that people are much more afraid of reboots, less like reboots and more like big hobnailed boots stomping over beloved memories. 'Ghostbusters' main mistake was a rather unfunny first trailer that suggested that Paul Feig and Melissa McCarthy's team up magic had finally spluttered out. The second trailer was much better, but once the naysayers had grabbed on to the first they were NOT letting go, no siree! So the good news for Feig fans is that 'Ghostbusters' in 2016 is almost as enjoyable as the original. A definite reboot and not a sequel, it nonetheless acknowledges the original with some nice touches and a few well placed cameos that serve to pass the baton. Everyone was well aware that they had some pretty huge shows to fill, and obviously put a lot of work in, with the end result a well acted, well written and technically impressive whole.Our four Ghostbusters are equipped with the scariest things known to misogynist muppets – female genitalia! They also come equipped with four actual personalities that are very well realized by the actresses concerned. Standout is Kate McKinnon, who seems to be channelling Tank Girl (wait for THAT to be offered very soon) as a very quirky genius, her marvellous face lighting up the screen as the characters weirdness is allowed to play around on it. Melissa McCarthy is quite restrained compared to her other roles with Feig but does her usual stand up job, with Kristen Wiig the sensible one who seems to have been possessed by Jennifer Aniston. Leslie Jones plays the only non scientist in the crew, but comes armed with a prodigious knowledge of New York and a bagful of sass. The icing on top is Chris Hemsworth, who plays their thick as a donut receptionist, showing a nice talent for comedy whilst he does it.The special effects are what you'd expect from a big budget film today, and the ghosts all look terrific. There's a return for a couple of non human characters that will delight some, and may even bring smiles from the grumpy gits. Children will certainly have a few scares (as in the original), and the script allows for jumps and laughs equally well. Much like the original it has an action finale that by necessity ramps down the humour but even so gives you plenty to cheer for and chuckle at.So 'Ghostbusters' is a really good film. There: I said it. I'm happy to slate a film if I don't like it (I walked out of the godawful new Ice Age film last week) but for most of this I had a goofy smile on my face and gave a few decent belly laughs. The female switch doesn't matter one jot, it only allows you to see four awesome actresses rather than actors. It's wonderful that once again bustin' makes me feel goooood.",Ghostbusters
524,ashdoginc,No inspiration here then,3,19 September 2021,"With all the bad reviews this movie got back in 2016 you might've thought it was all due to moaning Ghostbusters fans who simply wanted to see their old favorite characters brought back to life one more time. So I watched this film not really caring, just put it on. The first 30 minutes I thought were okay, that it was going the right way. But then it suddenly turned bad, bad enough that I fast-forwarded bits. It just lacked the inspirational creativeness that made the original great, and replaced it with time filling fluff that just made the movie drag.I was surprised that this film completely ignores the previous 2 titles in the franchise - but I guess they were going for a complete reboot. The fact they used women seemed more like a way of trying to make it relevant to modern Hollywood political thinking than to audiences. In my point of view political correctness is not funny in itself, but they tried. My guess is this is what the film will be remembered for, if people remember it.My advice: skip this one.",Ghostbusters

526,tone_e2000,Starts off okay. Gets worse.,4,12 October 2016,"First and foremost, this film is a failure. It's a blockbuster movie that made a loss, and there's no denying that, whether you liked it or not. And it was always likely to be a failure. Many of the largely male fanbase of the original films weren't going to be happy with an all-female cast, and women weren't crying out for a Ghostbusters movie aimed at them.But being a failure doesn't mean it's a bad movie. What makes it a bad movie is the poor script, the unfunny jokes and the bad direction. As it happens, I enjoyed the performances of most of the main cast members. Kristen Wiig is dependable, as ever; Melissa McCarthy is entertaining, if you like her style of acting (which I do); and Leslie Jones, although worryingly stereotypical, is fine. Kate McKinnon, however, playing the 'wacky' genius Jillian Holtzmann, goes from uninteresting to irritating as the film goes on.But this could be forgiven if the film was funnier and better written. Instead, it has a few good moments, some pleasing cameos and that's it. The rest of the time is filled with childish jokes and crap CGI. In its defence, my eight-year-old daughter enjoyed Ghostbusters, and it's good that the movie portrays independent women saving the day. It's just a shame they're doing it in such a highly forgettable and disappointing movie.",Ghostbusters

532,harbingerofapocalypse,It really is as bad as the internet would have you believe.,2,17 July 2016,"Don't believe the critics, who are mostly reviewing this in an effort to 'balance' the hate that they believe is solely due to its gender switching. The bulk of criticism of this film has absolutely nothing to do with that. This movie plain sucks, and sucks hard. It's just not funny. And with the people involved, it had the responsibility to be vastly better than it was. I love McKinnon, McCarthy, and especially Wiig, so it's not a matter of thinking that women can't be as funny as men. Jones is, in my opinion, one of the least funny SNL players though I don't think she's outright bad. Here though, she was embarrassing. Still, I don't totally blame her - her horrible character is mostly the writer's fault for her terrible lines and the director's fault for the awful performance. Even Wiig was so low-energy through the whole thing. None of the ladies had chemistry with each other. They just went through it, reading their lines, with very little spark. I was completely open-minded to the idea of an all-woman show, even though I thought it was totally unnecessary and felt gimmicky, but they really should not have made it a reboot or remake or whatever they want to call it. It should have been its own original story. As far as the cgi goes, I get why it looks bad. It's on purpose and is trying to be cheesy, the same way the original was. But it just comes off as cheap, not as a clever nod to the first. The biggest problem with it is it's just not funny. Aside from a few of Hemsworth's ditzy antics and one scene where the school dean comes up with a couple creative ways of flipping off Wiig and McCarthy's characters, I didn't put out more than a minor chuckle or two the entire movie. Even my wife, who was so very excited about this movie and primed to laugh at even the smallest joke, complained about how massively disappointing it was. There were so many missed opportunities and misjudgments in this that you really can't help but be angry. The end credits show a perfect example. During the film Hemsworth's character is possessed and temporarily takes control of a large group of military and other people in the street. He makes a motion and everyone in the group strikes a pose straight out of Michael Jackson's Thriller (one of the minor chuckles I spoke of). But that's it. Then during the end credits you see some of the entire sequence where Hemsworth directs the group in the full dance. All you can say is WTF were they thinking, not including at least some of that in the main film? That was actually funny. Instead, we get stuff like the millionth boring Exorcist reference with an over-the-top, unfunny shout and slap that drives out the demon. What you saw in the trailers really are the 'funniest' parts of the movie. If you hated the trailer, you will hate the movie. Do not believe the PC reviewers and critics who are saying different, just because they don't want to be accused of misogyny. This time the annoying internet fanboys who were hating on it before even seeing a single frame of it just happened to accidentally get it right.",Ghostbusters
533,MikeRydal,Misndry!...Misandry Everywhere! OH THE IRONY!,5,2 November 2016,"First of all...I love the original Ghostbusters and was part of the 2016 'trailer haters' club but after viewing, I didn't hate the movie as much as I thought I would.Good Things!...When the actual 'Ghostbusting' happens, it's great fun. Well choreographed, well executed and has great physics and visuals. I would actually say that the last act makes the film. I would also say that GB2016 has a reasonably good story line, nothing amazing but suits the movie very well.Bad Things!...The major issue with the movie is the 'humor' and I use quote marks because it just isn't funny. There were one or two moments where I genuinely laughed but the vast majority of the dialogue is so cringe-worthy that I considered ending the movie during the first act.I can't emphasize how truly awful the 'comedy' is. The movie should have been charmingly funny but sadly, it relies on lewdness and misandry. It's an unsophisticated movie aimed at a puerile audience, so if jokes about queefing, poop and farting aren't your thing...you may want to avoid this movie.The Cast...Though some of the cast are genuinely funny people, Melissa McCarthy is the cinematic equivalent of nails on a chalkboard. Every moment of her screen time is predictable, desperate and annoying. Kristen Wiig is the best character in this movie, delivering the only few laughs to be found. Though many of her gags are too drawn out and unfunny. Kate McKinnon is dull and forgettable but does bring a little cheeky glamor. Leslie Jones plays a black woman as written by a white guy...ya...moving on.What Misogyny?...We're all aware of the name-calling regarding the trailer reactions but the irony is, GB2016 is rife with misandry. EVERY SINGLE MALE CHARACTER IN THIS MOVIE IS EITHER AN IDIOT, A VILLAIN OR AN OBSTRUCTION. Let me put it this way...if every female character in GB2016 was a white person and every male character was a black person : this movie would have seen in a VERY different light.Spoiler! to defeat the 'big bad' at the end of the movie, the writers decided to 'up' the misandry by shooting 'big bad' in his d*ck (massive face palm)All in All...This is a bad movie but there are parts which can be enjoyed. When the girls are 'bustin,' it's difficult to not be entertained. I heard that the filmmakers were trying to promote strong female roles and to an extent, it works...the girls really kick ass at times. The big problem is that the derogation of men is so abundant and obvious, that it alienates half of it's demographic. It would have worked far better to treat each gender as equals...sure, have dumb characters and villainous characters but the genders should have bee mixed. Ironically this makes the filmmakers intentions completely counter-productive.GB2016 IS an important movie...it has single handedly exposed the death of sophisticated comedy in mainstream media to the masses.

536,blossoms-733-387580,A fun homage to the original!,7,21 July 2016,"I loved the original ""Ghostbusters"" and was afraid this might be a bad remake of it, but instead it really felt like a homage to the original. Even Bill Murray gave his stamp of approval with an ironic cameo as a paranormal-debunking scientist. The idea of making 4 women the new ghostbusters was great since a team of 4 men IMO could never replace the greatness of the original cast of Bill Murray, Dan Akroyd, and company. While the writing could be improved the movie doesn't fail to deliver on laughs and the close relationship of the diverse female cast also shone through. ""Ghostbusters"" also offers man-eye candy and girl crushes galore in the form of a very buff rhythmically capable Chris Hemsworth and a quirky and cute Kate McKinnon as the socially awkward engineer of the bunch.The subtle subtext of the film (that you might not pick up on unless you're a woman) is that the projects and endeavors that are spearheaded by women often get less funding, less attention, and less support. However, the movie says, you shouldn't give up--you can still make it if you try. So, in many ways ""Ghostbusters"" is another great underdog-triumphs-in- spite-of-major-obstacles kind of story that anyone who has ever been the underdog can relate to.Another great thing about the cast is that each woman is quirky and unique in her own way. And none of them were 20 year-old sex objects with silicone implanted everywhere in their body. I loved seeing real women being real women and I hope to see them on the big screen again soon. They definitely have my $20 for IMAX 3D!The film isn't without its flaws (awkward script) but I approached it as an entertaining story that, as a woman, gave a bit of a boost to my confidence which can flag at times. I find that most of the people bashing this film are socially backwards, sexist, middle-aged men who probably want nothing more than for Trump to become president.

So far so Ghostbusterish. Next step throw in $144,000,000....... I'm assuming they threw about $120,000,000 into a numbered Swiss bank account as it couldn't have been spent on the terrible CGI in this film and the cast surely couldn't have cost that much you'd get Clint Eastwood, Brad Pitt, Angelina Jolie (not at the same time) Scarlett Johansson the whole cast of the walking dead and Waldorf & Statler for $120,000,000. So we have standard Ghostbusters characters overplayed ala Akroyd (excluding Kate McKinnon who just seemed to be on some kind of hallucinogenic mushrooms throughout) poor effects, painful script and forced 'whackiness'. As I said it's not terrible but it seems such a waste. Waste of talent as there are some good comedic actors in this (excluding Kate McKinnon and her mushroom grin) waste of the possibilities for special effects in the 21st century as they were on par with the original 30 years ago so tragically poor and a waste of a chance to shut up boring original Ghostbusters fanboys from pretending the original is a masterpiece that cannot be beaten.

540,JamesAlvarez520,My Honest Opinion,7,26 July 2016,"Sometimes I feel like I'm taking crazy pills. Everyone seems to hate this movie except me. I'm not sure why, I mean, this movie is no Godfather but it certainly isn't the worst movie I've ever seen either. I'm going to take the risk of being tared and feathered by the IMDb community and write something positive about this movie. Because guess what, I genuinely enjoyed it.What's to enjoy? The all female cast (there I said it. Sue me); Do the characters fall flat at times? Sure, I'll admit that. However there were some admirable traits to each character that paid homage to the original set of Ghostbusters. Here's a quick breakdown:Kristen Wiig's character is a hopeless romantic who comes off as slightly annoying just like Bill Murray's character in the original.Melissa McCarthy's character is the ambitious yet naïve character that Dan Aykroyd played.Kate McKinnon is the weird and awkward scientist, just like Harold Ramis.And just like Ernie Hudson, Leslie Jones plays the ""normal"" team member who asks the plot-driven questions to help the audience understand the scientific on-screen jargon. (This really was Winston's purpose in the original film, look it up).I like these four actresses. Individually they do great work. As a team of four they do okay, but overall it's a good dynamic of weird, serious, and funny performances from the group as a whole.Stop complaining about Chris Hemsworth being the dumb and pretty receptionist. For every one guy that plays the mindless eye-candy in a movie there are like fifteen women that play the same role in other movies (just watch any of the 3,000 James Bond films).This film is definitely an underdog story both on and off the screen. The plot is simple and straight forward but that is common with big budget Hollywood films. Honestly, if you ask me why this film stands out amongst the summer Hollywood canon, I would say it's because of the progressive and bold move by the filmmakers to cast all females. Does that automatically make the film good? Certainly not, but it also does not make the film automatically bad. Overall, I found the movie fun and entertaining. As far a re-boots go, there have been way, way worse re-boots that haven't had nearly as much criticism. If you think my judgment is off, I'll give you my personal top 5 and bottom 5 movies and then you can gauge my film quality experiences, standards, and assessments from there.Top Five: 1. The Abyss 2. Jaws 3. Independence Day 4. Back to the Future 5. Mad Max: Fury Road Bottom Five: 1. Batman & Robin 2. Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones 3. Fantastic Four 4. Jurassic Park III 5. Spider-Man 3There. Use this information to determine weather or not I have good or bad taste in movies. If you agree with this list in the slightest, then there's a small chance you'll find it in your critical, movie savvy heart to find some good in Paul Fieg's Ghostbusters.",Ghostbusters
541,Oeuvre_Klika,Very good entertainment,8,23 August 2016,"I'll start this (soon very positive) review by saying that I was very disappointed by the beginning of this movie. I'd rather forget the first 15-20 minutes or so, because for me the real movie started after that, when the whole gang was working together. At the start, I thoroughly disliked the humour and the rhythm of the story. It's like that part never went further than the first draft.But then it really starts, and what a good movie! The story is solid, with a clear plot (not always the case with big movies these days) and no time for boredom. Humour is well present throughout and feels natural. The cast is excellent.Much has already been said about the all-women cast. Even if this wasn't the reason for which I went to see it, I really enjoyed watching a movie that had intelligent and brave women as its main characters, who didn't need help from men (without constantly proclaiming it), and never showed more flesh than was necessary, even wearing the completely unsexy Ghostbusters jumpsuits. All four stars were given the opportunity to shine and show their acting and comedy talents. I wasn't familiar with any of these four actresses before, and it was a more than nice discovery for me.Other roles were also well cast, and I must mention the little gem that was comic-relief and eye-candy Chris Hemsworth as Kevin the receptionist. He was perfect in this, and I enjoyed the fact that his presence as the only male of the team was never overwhelming in regards to his female co-stars, but that he still had his place in the story.If only I hadn't disliked the beginning so much, I would have given a 10/10.",Ghostbusters

Now back to the movie, after watching the trailer I couldn't get myself to spend money on this movie, I waited patiently for an opportunity to rather Watch it on the small screen and I am not disappointed for the choice i made. The characters are not believable, the nonsensical, clichéd plot was disappointing. I only need one hand to count the number of times I laughed. The movie is far to looooong.

543,elizy-33092,Holloywood needs to quit remaking classics and start something fresh,4,24 April 2017,"When I heard that they were remaking the movie Ghostbusters with female cast members, I admit that I was actually looking forward to it, specially considering the four particular actresses they had chosen for the part. I understood that movie remakes are typically the greatest, but considering the fact that 3 out of the four cast members are currently or were once members of SNL, I had some hope. Unfortunately, Wigg's comedic talent wasn't able to shine with her boring character with a lack of personality, McKinnon's character was just upright stupid and unrealistic, Jones's character was just a black stereotype, and McCarthy's role lacked character as well. Many of the jokes just fell flat (Steve Higgins small role and joke with the middle finger, the won tons, Kevin's (aka. Chris Hemsworth's) logo scene, the thing with the hair dye at the end, and so on). Also, the had many references to the original ghost busters throughout the film, and yet I suppose the setting takes place in a universe where the original squad had never existed, it's like a slap to the face to the original cast. Sure they had Bill Murry and few other actors for the older version show up in a few small parts, but they play such tiny roles, and as different characters..And what's the deal with remaking older movies with female actresses or poc as the main characters. Don't get me wrong, there's nothing wrong with Hollywood wanting a bit of diversity in their work, but they're doing it all wrong. While this movie has good intentions when trying to cast female members, I guess either to have more representation for younger girls to look up to or show that women are equal to men or whatever, but when they try to do with a remake of a movie that was already amazing, it only makes matters worse. This movie will be forgotten within a few years from now, unlike the 1988 version, which most people had at least heard of reguardless of age before this one. On second thought, this movie isn't trying to create diversity, they're doing this for profit. They know that with the adults and their nostalgia these days, and with the younger now being obsessed with the classics due to them being conditioned to think that everything from their own generation sucks (which is clearly saying a lot about the older generation ironically, they're the ones whom produce our movies, not us), they can get some quick and lazy bucks by bringing back a film that should've been left alone in the first place instead of thinking up of a new script and story (that of which could also have female and/or poc leading characters), because they know people are more drawn to things that they are familiar with (as was I obviously). Whatever, I'm so done with remakes. There are many movies out there in today's time (yeah they exist) with original plot lines that are currently or were recently successful in the last year or so, so why watch a crappier version of a movie you've already seen before?",Ghostbusters

545,WYLION-SOTIRISKING,WYLION - Are you a god? Zappp!,5,16 June 2019,"No this movie is not a god so it deserves a zap.When deciding to remake a movie as iconic as Ghostbusters you need to make sure you do it right. This is something that wasn't taken into consideration for this version. When comparing the pros and cons, the cons far outweighs the pros. ""Why is this?"", you may ask. Have a watch and you will understand.Personally I thought the movie was fun and did have moments that had me laughing. The only issue was it felt very cheesy and lacked any effort to link the emotional connection between us (the viewer) and the characters. All I can say is thank god for Kate McKinnon (the main source of entertainment throughout).Something you may also be wondering to yourself is ""Why are the Ghostbusters female when the characters have always been male?"". The answer to that question is that due to the current society we live in people think it will be a huge draw for the movie. Of course that comes at the cost of possibly ruining a franchise.I'd say while this movie really isn't good it is still worth watching, once a year in the Halloween period.",Ghostbusters

One being Bill Murray, Dan Akroyd, Sigourney are a difficult act to follow. Two, the 80's era was different ..and nothing current can recapture the feel of that time. I tried to be objective but lastly couldn't convince myself that this film brought anything new to the ghost busting world other then to replace iconic actors. Bold move but it didn't work for me.

In fact, it is probably as good as the original which was awesome! I don't really get what people have against this movie. Is it sexism? Do people have a problem with a group of empowered intelligent women who can accomplish something without men being involved? As a father of a young daughter that's my favorite part of the movie. I think we need more movies like this that show that women can be intelligent, single and independent. A woman doesn't need some dumbass guy to be whole and complete. Is society still threatened by that idea? Seriously, is that what everyone's problem with this movie is?",Ghostbusters

I refused to pay to see it because I didn't want to contribute to what I knew was going to be bad. However I had no idea it was going to be THIS BAD. I forced myself to watch it. I nearly couldn't finish watching. Even the needing left me feeling even more depressed that they could waste so much money and come out with so much dross is beyond belief! This movie was rampantly sexist in not a nice way. All men are idiots in this movie. Whereas women seem to possess not only brains but an inability to flinch at ghosts at all, which seems out of place with not here they are not! All the horror was removed from this flick which makes it nothing like the first one. There was nothing scary, it was all woo hoo wee hee - like a fairground ride, which made it feel like it had no soul and it was just going through the motions.So what replaced the horror and soul.... you guessed it Comedy. Bad comedy! Comedy which was so overplayed that no joke in it hit any mark and you could see the set ups a mile away. The cameos by Bill Murray and Dan Ackroyd didn't play up to those characters importance to their original roles and were very forgettable moments which is a crime for this film to have done that to these actors. Cameos of this standing should be memorable.Really this movie should be erased from history and the negatives burned. It has caused so much upset and so much disappointment and everyone who said it looked bad was right. I cannot believe that there is anyone out there who actually gave this movie a vote above 3, so why it is even at 5.5 on IMDb right now astounds me. Sony must have fake accounts on IMDb like crazy to have even managed to drag it this high.Paul Feig, your a hack. May you never work in Hollywood again. What you did to this movie is unforgivable.

Literally as soon as this film started to get good reviews, what happened to the trolls who kept bashing this film for months and months primarily due to it starring women? They just proceeded to intentionally reduce the user score on this site so it's in the low 3.0's-4.0's. I mean at this point it's just embarrassing to see these whining fanboys get so worked up over a damn film. A damn film which, might I add, isn't as bad as those trolls are putting it out to be. Now I'm not saying that this film is perfect. There are some issues, namely in terms of pacing. And not every joke hits, namely during a pretty darn noticeable lull at the halfway point. But for the most part, the hit-miss ratio on jokes is pretty solid (70-30). And aside from some scenes that borrow story beats from the original films, this film and its characters are able to stand on their own as a unique part of the franchise. It certainly helps that the four leads are all excellent and have solid camaraderie. Plus the film does a great job of making them endearing protagonists.Bottom line... don't listen to the trolls. Don't let them spoil your fun if you're one of those who was excited to see this film. Seriously even if I didn't like it I would've still recommended it to people just because it, director Paul Feig, and his cast of talented and funny actresses deserve it after all of the crap they've gotten from the fanboy trolls ever since the film was first announced.",Ghostbusters

What I mean is that because they have a well know title or brand then the makers of the said game don't put much effort into making it. This ghost busters reboot is ghastly. How can anyone really think they could top Bill Murray. Hemsworth makes even worse with his paper thin performance. McCarthy is just terrible and should only be movies that require an overweight actress. Special effects are terrible, the original actually looks better in this respect.

In my world, there is no GB 2, that was a failure in my books. Now flash forward to recently, after Ramis passing on, my hopes of a GB 3 were dashed, not because of just that but Bill Murray being a tool, and not wanting to be a part of it. The I hear this was coming out, and having an all-female cast, was intriguing at the time. Then the trailer/teaser showed up and everyone dumped on it, more and more. The internet crapped on itself. I was willing to see it, also my daughter really wanted to see it, she loves movies with female leads. Everyone just shat on this, personally, it isn't great and nothing can compare to the original, but this insane hatred is not needed. Leslie Jones got the worse of it, I agree, I am not a fan of hers, but I am not going ape ass over her performance. The weak point in this was the bad guy, he did nothing for the movie. I loved the effects on the ghosts, and Kate Mckinnon (sp, sorry)was my favorite character, and it was nice seeing Melissa play a clean mouthed , basically sweet character. Overall it isn't perfect, but it is watchable and I enjoyed it. Personally, they could have had the characters mixed sexed, and relatives to original, to bring in Peter, Egon(RIP), Winston, and Ray (Sons,&Daughters, or Nephews and Nieces, for example) Still, as I said it is, to me watchable & enjoyable.",Ghostbusters

Sure, the movie was bad, but if I remember The 1984 version stunk as well, before getting a cult following. There are worse films out there, it is not fair to blame the cast, they worked with poor writing and directing. Blame Feig, he had a formula and tried to make it fit in an already established franchise. Booo, blame him and Sony.
What I would of like to see if the girls were the original GB kids, following in one of their footsteps( or at least one of characters, there is the link to GBI&II, not making cameos in the way they were handled in Feig's work. 
Also if it was maybe a mixed cast, male and female. Not Bridemaids with proton packs.

But anyone trying to give this a 10/10 has as much to sell you as someone giving it a 1/10.But, while it's impossible not to make comparisons to the originals (unless of course you actually haven't seen them) this movie does stand on its own. Mind you, it doesn't fly as high as the Star Trek reboot, but it's still oceans better than Finding Dory.There are some things Ghostbusters (2016) does right: Cameos and when the original theme song come on. Seriously, when it's Ray Parker's ""Ghostbusters"" playing in the background - those are the great parts of the movie. And most of the original cast add a lot without taking away the willful suspension of disbelief. And there are a few good one lines and jokes that made the entire audience laugh.But then, there are the things it does wrong: much like watching Jimmy Fallon, there were lots of jokes that were almost funny - but the deliver/timing made for a quiet crowd for the majority of the film. Much of that has to do with several of the cast members not creating memorable characters. Perhaps if there wasn't a comparison to legendary SNL iconic characters there might be less to compete with. They knew how high the bar was, and perhaps they recognized that despite a bloated budget of special effects, they should have spent more money on better writers and editors (A long, boring, 20 minutes more than the originals) even saying ""Well, that wasn't terrible."" at the end.They aren't wrong.

557,theduggan,An embarrassingly poor movie,1,22 July 2016,"It's not very often that I approach a movie with such low expectations, but when I do I am usually pleasantly surprised. Certainly not the case here. I cannot describe how dreadful this movie is. Dreadful direction, dreadful script, dreadful acting. This movie is just bereft of humour. I did actually manage one good laugh. Hemsworth's joke about his dog which he named Mike Hat. I did like that. But that was it. In two hours, one laugh. Unfortunately, it didn't add anything to the story. In fact, the movie is full of forced gags that don't add to the story in any manner.One of the endearing factors of the original Ghostbusters was the ease of which the leads rolled off each other, interacting seamlessly. With this remake, it's as if the leads were in separate rooms whilst performing. That's how much they lacked chemistry. Of the lead performances I thought Kristen Wiig was the best of a bad bunch. She can actually act. The rest really didn't offer anything to the point that you just don't care about any of them. They just didn't work together.On a budget of $150m I find it difficult to comprehend how they could make such a shambles of this. The biggest problem lies in the writing. Such a jumbled mess. Nothing makes any sense whatsoever in the story line. Feig surely must be embarrassed by his efforts here. Co writer and director. With the four leads potentially with so much to offer, he manages to turn them all into pieces of wood. The timing of everything is just off. I honestly believe that Ed Wood could have delivered a better effort. I honestly don't know how this got a Metascore of 60. There are far superior female led comedies out there with Metascores in the 20's. Walk of Shame and Head Over Heals spring to mind. An embarrassingly poor effort and such a shame.",Ghostbusters

This might explain the 4.9/10 user rating on IMDb, or it might just be thousands of people using multiple accounts to complain about a film which they haven't even seen yet because it hasn't been released in their country yet!! So what does someone who has actually seen the film, the entire film!, think? Well I thought that it was alright actually. It was actually fairly funny. After the opening I did have thoughts that I was going to be watching some form of Scooby Doo influenced Ghostbusters remake but as the film went on I thought it was alright and there were a fair amount of funny moments. Most of the characters were quite good and many had some funny lines. The effects in the film were also very good and made it more realistic and despite this being a 12A comedy it was scarier than this years 15 rated horror film The Conjuring 2. When it comes to the plot it does have a lot in common with the original Ghostbusters but this is obviously going to happen with this being a remake, but this remake does have a lot of original content and does still feel fresh. It is also fairly fun and the characters, plot and CGI make it even more fun and the same goes for the successful gags. There are one or two weird moments which do either drag a bit or have no real relevance to the plot apart from to introduce a cameo of a star from the original 80's Ghostbusters film. There are a lot of scenes in this film that have no real relevance to the plot and just don't have any relevance to anything but lengthening the film's 116 minute run time out. Not that the film is too long it's a decent run time and doesn't really have any problems with going on for too long apart from when scenes are just there for cameos.Quite a few of the jokes are good but they do lack in the brilliant third act but Ghostbusters is a fun remake, unfortunately it seems to lack something at certain points.*** <-- Three Stars",Ghostbusters

Ghostbusters 2016 Is confusing, Cringe-worthy, Goofy, and Is way to girlish that fails in comparison to the original ghostbusters. Ghostbusters is meant to be funny, Scary at times and fun for the whole family as well as being clever with its effects and performances especially Bill Murray. It's something new that kids would enjoy. So if that's the case of ghostbusters, what are you expecting in this reboot? Well....... I dunno...TALKING BIPEDAL GIRLS!!! AND CORNY MOMENTS THAT MAKES NO SENSE! Just Like Jurassic Park 3, My main problem wasn't the movie. It was about the girls. Just like any other girls would do, They would be doing gay Performances as well As Being So Bad at what they're doing. Bill Murray Must be in tears right now. Speaking of Bill Murray, While I do like Bill Murray, Unfortunately Him being just a role as well as barely having any screen time makes him very forgettable. The stay puft Marshmallow Man is back once again only for him to be literally a ballon the girls pop. His role gets entirely placed with something that Godzilla would just take on. This movie made absolutely no sense to the ghostbusters franchise. It didn't have any tie in nor with the franchise. This movie should of been a sequel to the original trilogy Instead(Which thank lord it's getting a sequel to original trilogy and not this) The Music was so forgettable especially The main theme that was only used once at the beginning and remade with something entirely new. Also, Ghostbusters 1984 is one of my fav movies(top 5). This one they took that movie, blended it up and made it worse. The balloon scene was really REALLY Dumb. And most of this is forgettable and It's storyline was predictable.Overall: while it isn't the worst film I've seen in a long time, Ghostbusters 2016 should have really been called ""GhostWankers"" Or ""GhostGirlies"" No girl stupid power. The only things I liked about this film is Chris Hemsworth (he plays as Thor in the marvel films), The CGI On the ghosts and some funny moments.

I confess I only saw this film because I received free tickets to the premiere. I went in with zero expectations and came out very pleasantly surprised. The new Ghostbusters is pretty damn good. It's (fairly) consistently funny, in unique and inventive ways, and showcases a host of impressive effects. What's great about the film is the writing. Paul Feig is a real natural at comedy, and once more he directs a script layered with witty dialogue. Of course, these are matched by excellent comedic performances. McCarthy does her usual shtick well enough, Kate McKinnon is slightly underused, but is absolutely hilarious, and even Leslie Jones, while a tad one note, proves nonetheless endearing. Kristen Wiig is probably the blandest of the four, yet plays a good straight (wo)man. The real surprise is Chris Hemsworth, who I honestly thought would be terrible in this, from marketing and trailers, but stole all of the best lines as an incredibly daft receptionist. Aside from providing a bit of kibble for gender role reversal, his performance reminded me of Brad Pitt in Burn After Reading, an attractive leading man who totally mocks himself in a comedy role, and it's similarly hilarious. In all, these characters and performances ensure the movie passes it's run time enjoyably. The negatives revolve around a plot that seems to short change a villain to only a few scenes, and culminate in a climax that seemed overlong, albeit capped off by an incredible vortex scene, you'll know it when you see it. Yet even if the plot is lacking in its mechanics somewhat, the movie never takes itself seriously enough (a la Tarzan or Batman vs Superman) for you to really mind. It knows its ridiculous. Another plus is the 3D, which was legitimately well done, a rarity for the medium. To be honest, misogyny debates aside, the marketing for this film was abnormally lacking, it's baffling to me how they reduced a film packed with funny gags to a trailer that was so cringe, but I implore you, if you love the first films, give this flick a chance, I'm sure it'll surprise a lot of people as it did me. Don't hate this movie for the sake of it, especially as I see this thing has a rating of 4.2, that's just plain unfair. If you go looking for fun, undemanding entertainment, that's exactly what you'll get, made with intelligence, wit and verve.",Ghostbusters
569,pemigewasset68,Swing and a miss,1,12 August 2017,"I heard about the hate, but I wanted to see for myself. These people have been another shows. In other bodies of work they've been entertaining. This should have been a formula for success. This just proves how filmmaking is as much art as science. This is the film equivalent of primary schoolers making breakfast in bed for Mother's Day. This film clunks along through juvenile humor, like the new kid in school trying to make everybody like her by trying to be funny. It feels like it was written by primary schoolers. I tried to like this movie. I tried hard. I tried as hard as this movie tried to be funny. We both failed. Utterly. Miserably. So. Much. Fail.",Ghostbusters

571,paul-gibbons22,"It's bad, it's really bad!",3,27 July 2016,"I sit down in the cinema with my popcorn and over priced drink hoping my friend was just being over dramatic and the film was going on to be OK to good, trailers come and go and the movie begins.The opening sets a really good atmosphere even if the guides reaction is a bit OTT, that gave me a good feeling about the film suddenly expectations and excitement grew. Unfortunately over the ten minutes that followed all that excitement would go. We meet Kristen Wigs character who for life of me can't remember her characters name (which shows how unremarkable she is) a brilliant physicist who later in the film has a laughable (not in a good way) sob story about the ghost of her neighbour and therapy as a child, turns out she and Melissa McCarthys character wrote a book about ghosts and Kristen is annoyed it's on Amazon ""shocking drama"". Melissa McCarthys character just comes across really snobby and unlikable, Holtz is slightly more memorable but again doesn't come across very well just really annoying rather than funny and then Patty. oh dear I feel for Leslie Jones I really do she's such a talent and to be reduced to playing a stereotype is just horrible to see. And everyone else in the film is basically stupid, unlikable or OTT. Kevin is the stupidest of them all and the characters especially McCarthys character never refrain from pointing it out which comes across as quite spitefulApart from the interview scene with Kevin the humour is awful, it's joke after joke hoping some would stick and none of them do they just fall really flat The directing is awful, felt at times like I was watching a TV movie or a student project it was that amateur. The score for the film was just as bad.And finally the CGI, I am shocked that a film with the budget it had would look that bad, it's the worst CGI I have seen in a movie for some time.In summary it's not the worst movie ever but it's by far the worst movie I've seen this year, which is such a shame, hoping to see strong women reboot a franchise and instead get boring, offensively stereotypical and occasionally spiteful women.",Ghostbusters
572,janetwilkinson,Oh Dear......,3,12 July 2016,"Having seen the trailers I can honestly say I wasn't expecting a great deal, however I went along anyway to see what the full film would add to the rather damning trailers.Unfortunately the film really didn't hold very much water, it had the 4 actresses which didn't really gel together with the chemistry not really hitting the mark. We had every single male character portrayed as either a complete moron or as creepy or as some kind of evil character.The jokes in the film were not very funny and the stereotypical lines given to some characters were offensive to say the least. To top it all off if there wasn't enough sexism and gender bias in the film already, they then had the final boss being fought by you guessed it being shot in the groin.Overall I think this film has been a huge disappointment. Every time a film gets given the opportunity to make use of female talent in a positive way, all we seem to get is a massive over reaction by feminist writers to spread hate, sexism and stereotypes. Is it any wonder so few people want anything to do with feminism these days when this is the type of film that gets produced when directors listen to them.The Heat (same director) was also guilty for a lot of the same flaws this movie and even ironically ended with the same sexist attack with the villain of that film being shot in the groin as well.I genuinely hope this film suffers as a result of the sexism and a lesson is learned here.",Ghostbusters

574,colinsiterecruitment,Had the misfortune of watching this,1,8 January 2017,"Had the misfortune of watching this nonsense. Why? I will never know? I had read reviews on it, I had listened to people who wasted money seeing this in the cinema. I still went ahead and took the plunge. The script is awful, non existent. OK they wanted an all female cast, so they managed to pick the 4 worst actresses they could find.The original Ghostbusters had a charm, the actors all ""clicked"" they all worked well. In this one the four females feel awkward, it feels false and put together, most of the gags ( if you can call them that) are so obvious that just leaves you feeling flat.If Hollywood are going to make movies and fill them with their twist and idea of political correctness, then at least make the film palatable. Having people sit through a political correctness movie and a dire script isn't any ones idea of a fun. The original was a good popcorn movie, about catching ghosts. No political statements, no hidden agenda, just a good old movie. This one, well I have no idea what it was trying to be? I wasted a couple hours of my life with this rubbish I wish I could get back.Hollywood should stop trying to make political statements in movies and go back to making movies people want to go and watch to enjoy.",Ghostbusters
575,vandylan92,Extremely unfunny and tired remake of classic comedy,1,15 July 2016,"I'm puzzled by all the professional (payed) journalists that are virtually screaming at us that either you LOOOOOVE this movie or you are a woman hating troll. Just like the worst SJW activists. It's just absurd. And we've seen similar behavior with other big budget movies during the past 12 months or so... I'm really starting to wonder if these critics aren't payed by Sony, Disney etc to write favorable (not so say raving) reviews and cast all those who disagree as near nazi like ""haters"". It's just too much.It seems pretty obvious that the vast majority of people just don't like this movie. These particular actresses just aren't funny. At least not in this movie, with its poorly written and tired lines and ""jokes"". That has nothing to do with hating women. Just as I can hate a movie with men in it, without hating men!It has nothing to do at all with the original Ghostbusters movies (that I love). It's more like a SNL parody of the original Ghostbusters. If you like fart jokes, vomit jokes and vagina jokes you will probably like this movie, because there are PLENTY of that here. If you liked the original Ghostbuster you will surely not like this movie at all.",Ghostbusters
576,TreeOfWolf,Actually funnier than Star Wars! (Mwahaha!),10,14 November 2016,"Ghostbusters didn't ruin my childhood memories. It was fun! I wanted to avoid it like a plague, but the special effects seemed worth it. I had a great time!!!The people who wrote bad reviews are right, but there's more to it.The morale of the story is: Even if you are the most useless type of woman, the most socially awkward nerd, or the worst racial stereotype... rejected by all, with society refusing to give you a chance to show your potential, discredited, a failure, a loser... You won't lose at all times forever. You can still save the day! You don't have to try to destroy society, being bullied isn't a reason. People do bad things because they choose to be bad people. Even in the worst situation, even if everyone think you're the worst, you can still choose to do the best thing. For yourself, for a friend, and even for everyone. Not everyone will acknowledge you, but some will. Knowing who you are, believing that you have worth, and friendship, is a better reward than fame.It's beautiful! It's a very good movie with great values.But the characters start as the worst losers, and the scenes to establish their misery are really cringe worthy... It's unbearably embarrassing when they get fired... At some point you just want to stop watching and die in shame... BUT! They persevere, and then things start to get better than they ever did. The movies shows that there can be hope even in utter hopelessness, but not necessarily where you want it to be.It's not sexist and racist. It actually denounces our sexist society by showing it. Like South Park. It's amazing to have a movie with many women as main characters, and not mindless sexual objects for once. Many people hated that, but it was refreshing!Reversing genders gave a chance to women to shine, and showed how bad sexism is, specially with their ""re-THOR-ded"" male secretary. He doesn't have the competences for the job but they hire him for his looks, and then they mock him for it while doing sexual harassment. It's considered normal to threat women like this, but it's wrong for everyone. But he didn't let the abuse affect his self confidence, he messed with them too playfully, showing that your own attitude is more important than other's. Actually he was never dumb. He was pretending to be, because the actor Chris Hemsworth actually played Thor in disguise, the way superman hide with fake glasses, and they made an obvious reference by calling him superman.I hated Thor because he's so arrogant, but the actor has such a warm genuine smile in Ghostbusters that I ended up loving him, and enjoying the movie like he did!People complained that a scene reminded them of Pixels. Yeah. And there's also a scene like Jim Carrey's dance in the mask, done by a very amused Chris Hemsworth. And a scene like Big Hero 6. They compiled best moments and I was happy to see epic scenes again.People complained that the special effects looks like Walt Disney. I'm a horror fan, but it was very refreshing to see detailed colorful ghosts instead of mere black blurs. The animation really is gorgeous.About being unworthy of the name Ghostbusters, the group actually wanted to call themselves something else. They made lots of references to the previous movies while being unique. All the previous actors showed support by making an appearance. The creators made extra efforts to give us bonuses. We even get to see Sigourney Weaver, the best woman to have as a role model. Because she was the hero in Aliens, instead to be a horny helpless damsel in distress. Unlike the James Bond movies, where even the actor hates how misogynist he has to be.It shows women at their worst, but it's not sexist, because they show them doing their best in adversity.The old movies were dorky too! Nerds were bullied by jocks but shown as capable in spite of their shortcomings. Society got better. Now they wanted to open our minds about women with a new story about bullying and acceptance. By using a cast full of women, they didn't spit on the old movies, they continued its spirit.It has a beautiful message: You can be who you are even if the majority rejects you for it, someday your special interests and talents will be needed. Don't expect everyone to be good to you. Don't reject your friends trying to be accepted by the majority, be good to your friends and appreciate those who already appreciate you.Painful road, beautiful destination.The green blob is a morbidly obese man who died from eating junk food. Too heavy to walk, he has no legs and fly, obsessed with eating garbage. Disgusting. But now he's having fun with a woman just like him; it shows that everyone can find happiness and love... with someone with compatible interests.Even the logo finally makes sense in such a cool way!I really loved Ghostbusters. But yeah, it made me cringe to be forced to acknowledge flawed people, how badly society treats them, and flaws into myself. But it made me laugh too~The villain was great, very dedicated. I'm glad that he reached his goal for a while and all hell broke lose! But dying for revenge felt ultimately pointless... because you're dead even if you succeed.So just enjoy your life, and this movie. There is potential for greatness and awfulness in everyone and everything. This movie had both~ You can dismiss it as worthless because it's not perfect, or you can appreciate what it has to offer... and this that's the whole point that this movie is trying to make people understand.",Ghostbusters

There is literally nothing redeeming about this movie. Nothing.

The four leading actresses really don't work well as a team. Kate McKinnon's 'zany' character is unconvincing and downright irritating. Kristen Wiig seems to play the same character in almost every movie.
Chris Hemsworth's character (a clunky attempt at role reversal) is just plain embarrassing.
The special effects are really not that special - they don't appear to have moved on much from those in the original movie.
Overall, The sheer fun and exuberance of the original has been lost. A great shame.",Ghostbusters

It's a blast!,10,16 July 2016,"Under normal circumstances I'd give it an 8, but since there are thousands of 1 star reviews that were put on this site by people who haven't seen the film, I feel compelled to give it a ten.I loved it. Yes, it's not the original, but I give them credit for doing something new with the Ghostbusters concept and doing it well, as opposed to ripping off the original.Chris Hemsworth is definitely the funniest character in the film, but as with any Feig film, there's plenty of humor to go around. It starts off early with Abby (McCarthy) and Jillian (McKinnon) draw in Kristen Wiig's character to listen to an 'EVP', which turns out to be a fart. It ends with Hemsworth's character, powered up by a ghost possessing him, forcing the national guard to do a synchronized dance routine. Leslie Jones' character, Patty, is the stand-in for the audience, and her signature brand of crass/loud humor is a riot! I especially liked the tribute to Egon Spengler, which was a bit subtle but appropriate. You'll see what I mean.At any rate, go see it. Don't listen to the legion of nostalgic fanboys or the critics.

It's almost like a slapstick comedy, but not even that, because not one single joke is funny. The original Ghostbusters had a little bit of comedy, but the jokes were delivered in a more serious tone, because most of the movie still had a ""creepiness"" to it...This movie is just GOOFY. No sense of suspense whatsoever. These actors have ruined this franchise as of now. I personally can't wait for the new Ghostbusters to come out. The preview looks like they got it right this time.

The opening psychic testing scene of the original has more belly laughs than this entire movie.Some great acting talent in Kristen Wiig and others but sadly they do not get the excellent material that was at the heart of the original film.

584,EpeeBill,Fun reboot of a landmark movie,8,6 August 2016,"The original Ghostbusters from 1984 wasn't exactly high art, but it captured the imagination of a generation. No wonder there's always been rumblings about that series continuing. The time for a second sequel to that film has passed and this movie pays a great deal of homage to the original film while striking out in its own new directions.Like 1984's version, this one centers around a team of paranormal researchers who discover a plot to create a supernatural cataclysm. Everything starts from this nucleus of friendship and moves out into a great action comedy movie. There are lots of winking references to the first movie, including a long list cameo appearances by the original stars. But, this film takes a lot of the ideas and technologies from the first film to a new level that adds an additional, original layer of fun. Fans of the old Ghostbusters films should really like this one as an exploration of the same themes as the originals, without being an attack on those films.I had a blast watching this film. I only wish it would have been made sooner.",Ghostbusters
585,fire-child,"Five years after release - & yep, as bad as I feared",2,4 April 2021,"I wanted to try and give some breathing room to this film, and review it years after the hype (good and bad) had settled down - to try and watch it on its own merits. And especially given that Ghostbusters: Afterlife is delayed because the virus.Well, conclusion: the trailer for that film is better by some distance than this entire movie. What a crushing disappointment.I need to stress as well - I don't feel it has anything to do with the gender of the actors either. The likes of Bridesmaids was great comedy at times, by the same director and part-cast. The Ghostbusters script here in contrast is an embarrassing flat mess. It would fail equally with a mixed sex, or all male cast. Boring, stereotyped, clichéd characters, and predictable plotting all the way.The tone is all wrong as well - too often cartoonist, outlandish and garish. Compared to the classic original's deadpan, stripped down approach, which added just the right amounts of sci-fi and fantasy minimalism when needed - it's a massive misfire in visual look. CGI was overused, and obvious.And worst of all - no even moderately funny jokes, at all! How did they not pick up in the dailies the jokes were so flat, whilst shooting this film?! The jokes they aim at are clichéd, flat, often childish, and so tired - a world away from the witty, sardonic lines of the original.To conclude: Paul Feig and crew can moan all they want about sexism, or woke prejudice. (Interestingly, with the treatment of one character in this film - that criticism is, shall we say, the pot calling the kettle black here too). Whilst unfair bias can certainly sometimes exist towards films, that wasn't the case. They realised deep down this was a stinker. Trying to divert away via gender bias and other claims, once they realised this was going to sink at the box office, was part of the damage control effort I fear.I wait then for Ghostbusters: Afterlife, with the hope it can erase this trash from my memory.Interesting as an exercise in how NOT to do a remake, or sequel, of a franchise.",Ghostbusters

I should join in !,6,3 October 2016,"There's a thing when you get older, you can shut up kids.Timeless classic I was born then, saw it, the original, and walked home without bothering anyone about the timeless wonder I'd just witnessed. Although the special effect were very, very impressive at the time.In fact I didn't see it in a theater back then, I was too busy saving money to buy the sneakers Ray Parker Jr. wore in the music video, and I also wanted the neon bedside lamp but it was out of my league, finally I got it on Christmas but it is not the point there.OK the ""reboot"" isn't very great. I had fun anyway. As in Feig's previous movies, the written oneliners and jokes fall flat, but thanks to a great cast the improv included in the final cut saves the day. Don't serve me the ""that kind of production is so planned, there's none of that"": it's blatant.Which brings me to Hemsworth... yeah, he's funny in this. But me too can play a houseplant and be funny in this. And I've nothing against the guy I think he's a fairly good actor.The thing that really annoyed me was Hemworth's momentum (yeah, everybody gets one, large cast, plenty of meals to serve, some egos in the way maybe, or agents, well, everybody gets its five minute of brilliance) was a direct and complete rehash of a very famous scene from The Mask.They not only pulled that off, but even brought back the scene, on repeat, to animate the first half of the end credits.

If you're a rational person, there's so much to enjoy about this movie if you allow yourself to have fun and go into it without being determined to hate it beforehand. I found this movie much better than the first original Ghostbusters, it had much more action, cooler gadgets, and the characters had distinct personalities rather than all being the greasy-looking shmos from the original. (still not sure why they made bill murray look like he hadn't had a shower in weeks, but i digress) The visuals are bright and colorful, a welcome change from the monochrome baddies of most action / paranormal movies. the gadgets are cool, there's enough weirdness to make you laugh. The theater i was in were laughing at all the jokes in the movie. Yeah there's camp, but the movie is well-aware of it's goofy elements and makes the most of them. The movie works well as a fun time for most age ranges, i'm 25 but i could see how a lot of kids would really enjoy this along with their parents and older siblings (in a good way, similar to the level of humor in the originals which was a little goofy too) Kate Mckinnon was definitely the highlight of the film and what made it really stand out for me, with Kristen Wiig, Leslie Jones and Melissa McCarthy each bringing their usual brand of humor to their characters.

""Shut up, dude, we are up to something. So what do we do with GB?"" ""Uhmmm... well, let's replace the cast with all females. That will be enough of a change so that people will accept this simple remake"" ""Genius, man! Something else?"" ""Yeah, well, the people loved the mixture of a bit of scariness with some humor by these former SNL guys..."" ""Cool. But let's add more jokes. Funny stuff, you know? Slapstick and such! FUnny hats! B*tch-slapping someone! Neurotic big city humor!"" ""Awesome. Now that we have the plot, let's get going"".The point is - it's not about the Ghostbusters suddenly all being female. They could have replaced them with aliens, kids, cats, wrestlers or iguanas. None of that would have been a cool idea, or a refreshing change, or a justification to simply remake a film people loved, but make it worse.It saddens me how Hollywood is so out of ideas that they either make too many unnecessary remakes or too many sequels (which feel tired and out of ideas eventually). This movie is not funny. Those jokes might work in SNL, but feel cliché, old, unfunny and embarrassing in a triple A-budget movie. The jokes are predictable, and totally ancient. The characters are tired clichés. The CGI is nothing special. There are plot-holes so big, the Marshmallow man could walk through them without touching the edges. The final battle and the...tactic is embarrassing. I mean, they call fans misogynistic but the big battle is the four ladies shooting the baddie in the crotch? Seriously? Who fought this was FUNNY? Remakes are hard. You need to have a good reason, a ""hookline"", other than ""let's squeeze more money out of an idea a guy had 30 years ago"". Why not let the original movie stand for itself? Why not leave it alone, instead of staining it's legacy with a jerkish, unfunny, badly directed, badly written, bursting at the seams with cliché embarrassing remake, even giving it the same name? Yeah, the guys at the studio can keep defending themselves everyone calling everyone who dislikes it misogynists. That way, they don't have to look at the silly, half-cooked mess they created and ask themselves whether this just wasn't a bad idea from the start, and was badly executed. This is just sad.",Ghostbusters
595,PeterJasonQuill,Finally got round to seeing this. And the audience were right on this one.,10,11 August 2016,"I finally got round to seeing this last night. And I have to admit, it was really good. The story seemed to go at its own pace, which I kinda liked, it also managed to fit in developing the characters and all the ghost busting stuff too. Which, when it comes to a movie. It works incredibly well. The special effects are really good. The ghosts look a lot more realistic, and all the scenes with the ghosts are incredibly thrilling and really keep you on end with the excitement of it all. I thought Kevin was an incredibly funny character, because he's just that bumbling idiot that kinda helps the ghostbusters, and the villain was a great character too. I loved his plans, and it really gets you thinking, how could these plans work? But they seem to work for him. And those end credits, they were so random, but incredibly funny. So overall. Go see this movie. You will not regret seeing it. It is just like a lot of the audience were saying. You don't want to miss out.",Ghostbusters

They tried so hard with the jokes and was just boring and stupid. I would fire everyone that had anything to do with this movie. Chris Hemsworth should stick being an Australian Thor because his acting, playing a stupid white man was way out of line. This was made for man-haters. If I pay to go to the movie it's not to watch 4 non- entertaining girls. Every stereotype is in each Ghostbuster. From loud black girl saying ""Hell Naw"" and being loud from the 80's, to a fat tub of lard that is boring, bossy, obnoxious. What is this fat girl that I'm watching? Did I just pay money to look at this thing. Someone stab my eyes out and gimmie back my 15 bucks!!!! Everyones acting was drama101 from high school. My drama class had better actors than this!!!

599,japearson-55450,Doesn't deserve such negative reviews...,7,9 August 2018,"When I heard they were making a female ghostbusters reboot, I had high expectations. This movie isn't anything amazing, but it's certainly progression.I feel like for it to have succeeded, it'd had to be perfect in every way. Whether this is because it's an all female cast or because of its predecessors I do not know, although I feel it may be both. Although not breathtaking, this movie did its job by providing the humour and good cast that I expected. The jokes are funny, albeit sometimes cheesy and the male receptionsit really delivers the best lines. I also love how self aware this movie is, the franchise itself is known for being over the top and they have really embraced it here.Plot wise, it's sweet and simple. A Physics professor named Erin attempts to remove her previous works on the supernatural from the public eye to avoid embarrassment. On the other hand, her old collegue Abby and her assistant Jillian are still using these works as the basis for their study at a seperate university.Erin attempts to persuade Abby to stop promoting their work, but instead gets roped back into the research project. They begin to investigate new areas and befriend their fourth member, Patty along the way. From here onwards, the plot revolves around two things... the capture and proof of the supernatural and attempting to discover whom is responsible for the sudden spike in paranormal activity, whilst the government attempt to cover up all evidence to prevent public outcry. Of course, the person responsible for the increase in ghosts is intent on using them for destruction and must be taken down, even if it means wiping out all the collected evidence of the ghosts existence. I highly reccomend a watch if your looking for a bit of fun that all ages can enjoy, just don't expect an Oscar worthy plot and you won't be disappointed.",Ghostbusters

605,BloomingtonAdam,"Less of a movie, more a series of skits",6,26 November 2016,"--Possible Spoilers-- -I can't believe that's really a thing.-The new Ghostbusters is a movie that pretty much every one knows the plot of at this point. Four women come together to battle a ghostly plague in New York City. On the surface, it's not a bad idea at all. With another set of actors or possibly different writers, it could have worked. There were several scenes this movie could have easily done without, and it would have been just as good of a movie, if not slightly better. Additionally, this movie suffers from almost everyone trying to be funny. There are very few ""straight men"" to balance things out. The first portion of the movie establishes the main characters and how they come together. Kristen Wiig's character is shown establishing herself in a job that is not referred to at any other point in the movie, and way too much time is spent with this.The middle of the movie goes pretty much as you would expect, with the crew busting ghosts and figuring out the details of what is a much larger plan. The climax is very well done, and a lot of originality was put in, along with nice nods to the original movie and cast. There is another scene at the end involving a rescue that does absolutely nothing for the story. Of the entire cast, Leslie Jones was my favorite. Her character seemed to be the most believable. I'm not sure what the process was for putting this together, but overall, the pieces didn't quite fit. It was gimmicky and predictable in some spots, and suffered from way too much mugging and goofing in others. There was very little balance in the group. In any group vehicle, there should be a nice balance of comics and straight men. You shouldn't have everyone trying to ham it up. I was definitely disappointed. I wasn't disappointed comparing it to the original, which is going to invariably happen. I was disappointed in this as a stand alone movie. If they do a sequel, I hope they can put together a good cohesive script. The special effects are pretty, but a good story would be nice, too.",Ghostbusters
606,onlineairsoft,I feel like I lost 50 IQ points watching this movie,1,20 July 2016,"I've watched the original, but not for years and wouldn't say I'm a hardcore fan. I felt indifferent when I heard they were remaking it.Fortunately I got to see this for free. What an absolute mess.Was this film written by a 10yr old?The script and character decisions make absolute no sense. No one acts like that in real life.Is shouting supposed to make the joke funnier?The first two minutes let you know what's in store. A confusing narrative with nonsensical extreme sexiest stereotypical characters littered with shouting and toilet humor.Children under 10 might find some of the jokes and characters funny.I'm just baffled as to why/how these films get approved and funded. Did anyone even read the script before approving and giving this film a $140,000,000 budget?",Ghostbusters
607,dpandlisa,Bad Characters and Sophomoric Humor Are This Movie's Downfall,3,1 August 2016,"Forgive me. My willpower wasn't strong enough. I had to see the new Ghostbusters for myself to form my own opinion while it was in theaters;, but on the bright side, since it doesn't appear to be doing too well at the box office, what's the 12 bucks I spent gonna do to help?Anyway, about the movie itself... it certainly lived up to my expectations. I'm going to be comparing GB 2016 to the '84 version quite a bit in terms of how both movies handle certain aspects, which I think is fair because GB 2016 uses the same darned title of the original and the outline of the story of the new movie follows the beats of the original JUST enough to warrant comparison, I think. I'll give the GB 2016 this: You certainly can't compare the personalities of the new Ghostbusters to the original ones, except MAYBE Melissa McCarthy's Abby Yates to Dan Aykroyd's Ray Stanz (but not really). And Kate McKinnon and Chris Hemsworth's characters are as polar opposite to Harold Ramis and Annie Potts' Egon and Janine as you can get, but that's not really a good thing because...Almost all of the characters in Ghostbusters 2016 are either: Idiots (OH GOD CHRIS HEMSWORTH), A-holes (Melissa McCarthy), a combination of the above (Kristen Wiig), or plain old craaaazy! (KATE MCKINNON'S HOLTZMANN WAS THE SCARIEST PART OF THE MOVIE and the director should've told her to tone it down.) Surprisingly, the only character I was close to liking was Leslie Jones' Patti, since she was written consistently and was the most relatable Ghostbuster, while other characters randomly make total 180 degree switches in their personality and/or are WAY too over the top to be relatable. Compare this to the original movie, where the actors and the script make the main characters charming despite their faults, thus making them fleshed out as a result.The new characters had the potential to be funny and memorable, but unfortunately the script and presumably the ad-libbed parts are what REALLY bring this movie down to the cellar. A lot of the jokes go on for way too long (though it's not like they were funny the first five seconds), and there's some cringe-worthy toilet humor in the beginning. If I went on about the ""humor"" of the movie, I'd be here all day, and I seriously can't express in writing how bad the comedy is; you can DEFINITELY tell when lines are ad-libbed. Hemsworth in particular struggles with ad-libbed gags like the name of his dog (named MyKat). Maybe that type of humor isn't for me, but to me, it doesn't hold a candle to the dry wit of the original, where the writers let the audience figure out the jokes for themselves instead of bashing the punchline over their heads as if they were a bunch of seven-year olds.The writing and direction doesn't just fail in the humor department, it also fails to create any sort of real creepy atmosphere. The ghosts in GB 2016 are too cartoony to be unsettling, and the new villain is absolutely unmemorable while Zuul and Gozer were very threatening and a step above the regular ghosts like Slimer. I know I didn't discuss the actual plot of the new movie much, but when you get down to it, the most important aspects of Ghostbusters should be the characters and a balanced combination of humor and horror, and while Ghostbusters 2016 had a little bit of potential, the 1984 classic outdoes the new movie in all the ways I mentioned above.",Ghostbusters

It was fun, it was hilarious and I am not comparing it to the original, so I have that preconceived idea of what it 'should' be. It was clever and included all the villains. It was exciting seeing New York in it's authentic style, having a range of characters for people to enjoy. I would aim this more towards teenagers, it has a kind of Goosebumps/Charlies Angels feel. The best was the cameo appearances from the original cast. This had a great soundtrack, good cast and it was visually great too. I hope there is a sequel, I'll be there to see it!

Certainly not.I enjoyed it and I especially liked the cameos from the original cast but in fairness, if I had paid good money to watch it I too would have been annoyed.Unfortunately it does belong in the reject bin with all the other reboots and poor sequels such as Independence Day and point break but it certainly watchable.",Ghostbusters
611,veikkohoffman,Who Though This Was A Good Idea?,4,22 July 2016,"The only reason I went to see this movie was that I had lost a bet with a friend. The punishment was ""having to watch this bad-sounding film"", but I was determined to watch it with an open mind, not letting my expectations cloud my judgment. I was completely ready to like this movie had it been surprisingly good...sadly it wasn't. Due to IMDb guidelines, I am warning that this review contains spoilers. However I recommend reading it before watching the film nonetheless, as giving away plot points might work as an attempt to save whoever reads this from seeing the movie. You're welcome.I graciously give this reboot a 4/10 rating. You can think of that as a rating for either an otherwise decent film with extremely many flaws, or a basically terrible film with some redeeming qualities. A part of me wants to give an even lower rating, but I have to admit that some aspects of the movie were quite good, if not good enough for it to be an overall pleasant cinematic experience. Much like the Ghostbusters franchise, I'll start with the good parts.Despite the characters being annoying (more on that later), the level of acting is fairly decent. One of the four main characters, Jillian Holtzmann played by Kate McKinnon, is actually quite funny and likable. Chris Hemsworth also has enjoyable moments, and Bill Murray and Sigourney Weaver's cameos are cool. It was also nice to hear the original theme song, and some of the references to the original movie were clever. That concludes the good sides to this film.The rest of it is more or less a disappointing and aggravating mess. The concept of making a feminist all-female reboot for Ghostbusters was questionable as it was, but here's the terrible part: the point of making a feminist all-female reboot is destroyed by the main characters being annoying over-the-top parodies of the female gender. This movie somehow manages to be offensive towards everyone by trying to appeal to everyone. For example I think the negative reception of the black character Patty isn't racist; what IS racist is the writers of the movie making her into the most stereotypical black character in cinematic history. I'm not saying that all characters should be politically correct and defy stereotypes, I'm just saying that a such a cliché character is unfunny and annoying to watch.But all that is only a small part of why this movie fails. As a fantasy/sci-fi film, it's very unoriginal and boring, and as a comedy, most of the humor consists of completely dumb jokes that make you groan and sigh instead of letting out the smallest laugh. There is no sign of the fresh and genius humor that the original Ghostbusters was filled with. The dialogue is horrible, while clearly trying to be clever and witty. And there are just so many individual moments that are absolutely ridiculous, from the over-cheesy ""Who wants to go save New York City?"" line (answered by the girls cheering ""Whooooo!""), all the way to the climax where the girls defeat the final ghost by shooting him in the groin. Now as I said, some of the references to the original movie were clever. However, most of them are so on-the-nose that they force one to roll their eyes. A fine example of this is the origin scene of the Ghostbusters logo. Watching that scene, even a child who hasn't seen the film could easily guess where it's leading to several minutes before the ""big and clever reveal"", which the filmmakers clearly tried to make into an epic moment, whereas it turned out as laughably dumb and almost painful to watch.Now this movie gives a feeling of glory and happiness once it ends. As the credits start to roll, the viewer feels free, relieved that it's all over. Then, they're treated to a series of MANY mid-credit scenes, which a curious viewer like myself is forced to sit through after coming that far. After suffering through the credits, I now know what horror movie protagonists feel like when the monster comes back for one last scare.All in all, I strongly recommend passing this abomination of a summer blockbuster and re-watching the original movie instead. Of course this is just my opinion, and there are bound to be people who like this movie, and I am very interested in hearing their reasoning. But for me personally, this movie was so bad in so many ways, that I felt the need to write this review. Usually I'd end with a joke or reference tying up my take on the film, but this one doesn't deserve the time of coming up with something, so I'll end this in a dull and humorless fashion - very much in the spirit of the movie.",Ghostbusters

The original ghost busters from 1984 with Dan Ackroyd, Harold Ramis, and Bill Murray, was much funnier, and was a great comedy over all. The circumstances of the plot fell through and never really delivered the expected hoo-haw that came with all the hype from before the movie was released. It just fell flat on its face.

614,Se7en14,Very funny movie with funny people but not as classic,7,18 July 2016,"First lets get one thing out of the way. When I first heard they were rebooting Ghostbusters I was disappointed, One we weren't getting a third Ghostbusters movie though many can say the video game that came out in 2009 was the actual sequel, and with the passing of Harold Ramis shortly after all hopes for a third sequel were gone. Then of course there was news swirling round that there was reboot incoming there were so many rumours like Jack Black being named as one of the people who'd star and more. Finally we got confirmation that it would be an all Girl cast of Ghotstbusters, the internet freaked out.Now fast forward we've seen trailers and clips and much more and yet people still seem mad, and looking through the IMDb section as of release of this movie people seem to be calling it sexist, awful, horrible, giving it 1/10 with no validity at least in my opinion. Lets get one thing straight this is not the Ghostbusters we knew and grew up with as much as we'd love it to be, and yes it all an all female cast.... which makes me ask those who claimed as being sexist, exactly how so? We live in an age now that women should be respected and looked at as equal not inferior, and in an age where we fight for equality I ask those who have called this movie sexist exactly how?The movie itself has some very funny moments, for one the 3D is top notch and I am usually not one to enjoy 3D movies, the cast is also funny Kristen Wiig is hilarious as always and Melissa McCarthy stands out as usual either you really love or dislike her. The plot is very straight forward and borrows elements from both the original movie while paying homage to them in certain ways and yes the cast of the original movie do show up to do some cameos but it feels a little empty.... In my opinion one of the ways they should've integrated the movie was continuing the work of the original Ghostbusters, but how they've done this one is pretty much summed up it's a complete reboot the 1984 version and 1991 version do not exist in this universe but hey anything can happen in the future right?Above all we've given fair chances to many other reboots that were worse, going by the movie you either went in hating it before it started or you were willing to give it a chance. The trailers and clips didn't wow me, or make me laugh but the movie itself was done well enough to make me entertained and enjoy some fun and nostalgia, is it the classic movie we all remember and hold dear and grew up with? No. But is it fun and entertaining? I certainly enjoyed myself and hope we see more and maybe just maybe get a crossover with the original team. Here's hoping. Ghostbusters is fun and well worth a check.",Ghostbusters

There were some references and cameos from the original like Slimer, the Marshmallow Man and the original cast. This movie is like Ghostbusters meets Real Housewife/Kardashian crap!

616,rcadavidson,"Boring and Not Worth the Money ""Renting""",1,21 October 2016,"Thank goodness Redbox exist. With the backlash the movie got from the trailer, which I admit didn't look that great, and the performance it had at the box office, I had very low expectations, and even then, those expectations were not met.First of all, let's talk about the comedy, if you can call it that. It's pretty much the most juvenile humor you can think of since *insert Adam Sandler movie*, and it tries way too hard to be funny. Even when I remember the last Ghostbusters, I remember it being a bit grounded. Yet, unlike this ""thing,"" it was actually funny when it does try. I have heard that the cast was trying to outdo each other to see who's the funniest from one of the main starring roles, so that should really give you confidence in this movie.Speaking of cast, I much prefer Bill Murray and the other OGs over this ""female Ghostbusters."" Not saying that a female Ghostbusters wouldn't work, but this cast isn't that great at all. My first problem is that, again, they tried too hard to be funny, which comes off as annoying, and if that's not enough, there are even some stereotypes, which is funny when people are called sexist for not liking this movie, yet the main characters hire a male receptionist just because of his looks (sure ain't for his smarts), and even Leslie Jones plays the stereotypical loud black woman. Overall, there's not much to like about these guys.As far as CGI, it ""meh"" at best. It can look decent at times, but other times, like with the Marshmallow Man for example, it can look cartoony. Really, this is the one time I prefer the original Ghostbusters special effects over the new one, despite the fact that the old one uses 2D effects.Overall, I highly recommend a skip. It was pretty boring, it tries too hard to be funny, where as the original movie didn't have to try that hard, and the cast of characters suck. Instead, I recommend watching the original movies, and even the 2009 video game which fans unofficially call ""Ghostbusters 3,"" and with good reason. This is just an example of a movie that didn't need to be rebooted and suffered for it.",Ghostbusters

It's not even one of those ""so bad it's good"" movies, it's just bad. The problem with it is that it tries too hard to capitalize on nostalgia and really intolerable ""comedy"" that is all too common in our movies these days. You know the kind I'm talking about. Hey that person said something stupid. It's funny! Laugh! And while this might be entertaining for your average stoned 5 year old child, to an adult who looks fondly on the original Ghostbusters this is a dreadful attempt to get a laugh out of your audience. It's on par with the crap we see in too many ""horror"" movies where all it does is it throws jump scares at the audience hoping that the sudden burst of sound will get them to jump. It's pathetic Hollywood, just stop. Let me address some of the issues I have with this ""movie"" (yes, I don't call it a real movie, it's more like a really long and dull SNL skit). Here comes the spoilers, so if you don't want to be spoiled (though to be honest there's nothing in this ""movie"" worth worrying about being spoiled) then you may stop here. 1. The characters are dreadful. I haven't watched that many movies with these actresses in it, but I've seen enough to tell you that they play the SAME CHARACTER in every one. Yeah, sure their names change and their professions, but their personalities are exactly the same. And for a movie to profess proudly to be about empowering women you would think that they would have their main characters not be bumbling messes of insecurity and/or idiotic racial tropes. 2. The villain is awful. And not awful in the way a good villain should be, but awful in the way that he wasn't thought out and nothing is explained. His introduction literally starts with him saying to himself in the mirror ""You've been bullied your whole life, but soon they'll all be your slaves"" or something like that. So his only motivation is that he was picked on his whole life. And somehow he is a genius that knows how to conjure ghosts and create a portal to allow ghosts into the physical world. The only explanation given is that he read a book. Wow, how profound. Then, as he returns in ghost form, he somehow has the ability to possess people (something the other ghosts don't do), control people en mass (again something the other ghosts can't do), and change his form to anything he wants (another thing the other ghosts can't do). Are we led to believe that he can do this because he read a book or because he was bullied his whole life? Either explanation is stupid and the ""movie"" doesn't bother giving you either. 3. The ghosts are stupid in both design and ideology. There is literally one part of the ""movie"" in which there is a ghost parade and the ghosts are the parade balloons. I'm not kidding, and how do they defeat these balloon ghosts? They pop them. Seriously. The last one (which happens the be the Stay Puft Marshmellow Man) gets popped with a pocket knife. I don't know what else needs to be said about that other than that's ridiculously stupid. I would go on, but honestly just trying to write about this makes me want to punch a kitten in the face.

621,jshoesmithkr,Perfect,9,19 August 2017,Nothing wrong with it. I would say that the cast was funny and unforgetting. They seemed good together. Holtzmann was good and Kevin was awesome. More happened in this one so don't slag a good movie off before watching it. Female cast is just as good as a male one. If you liked Wonder Woman then how is this any different?

622,auritone,"Will someone please shout ""CUT""!?",2,29 October 2018,"It took me quite a while to watch this movie. Not because of the whole ""female"" non-controversy, but because I was getting really sick and tired of re-boots and re-makes of movies that were already good.
Now that I finally watched it, I have to say that this is a contender for worst re-boot/re-make I have ever had the misfortune of watching. Ghostbusters 2016 seems to have completely missed the point of what made the original work.
What on earth made Paul Feig believe that it would be fun to have everyone act like cartoon characters, is simply beyond me. Add to that incredibly cringy add-lipping, jokes so childish you would think it was made with kindergarteners in mind (some of which are repeated ad nausea) , a plot that has little to no resonance at all, and constant, unending talking making even scenes that could have been atmospheric and somewhat creepy (the animated mannequin doll) falling flat on their face.
With all the talking, jokes, dumb guy covering his eyes when he hears a loud noise, dancing, shouting, woo-hooing, etc. etc. etc. Ghostbusters 2016 is like a 5-year old jumping around on the bed screaming at the top of his lungs, ""LOOK AT ME! LOOK AT ME! LOOK AT ME!"" in its utter desperation for getting laughs. That desperation was the only laughs the movie got from me, as I could not believe the depths they were willing to sink to - and then actually repeat them.
It's a movie completely devoid of direction, atmosphere, charm, and most importantly humour.
I cannot recommend this movie to anyone. Watch the originals instead!",Ghostbusters
623,dlxmarks,Not a great film but not deserving of all the hate,4,19 March 2017,"For various reasons this film attracted a maelstrom of hatred, most of it undeserved hyperbole. To be sure, I don't think this is a great film but it's not terrible. The biggest challenge it faced was living up to the reputation of the original and unfortunately it missed that mark. Because the plot is so similar to the original (and to the second film for that matter) this film is really a remake and not a reboot so right off the bat it's set up to fail. Reboots have proved successful but remakes of GOOD movies are always a bad idea; the best you can hope for is to be as good as the original. Still, some aspects were enjoyable: Melissa McCarthy and Kristen Wiig (actors with significant movie experience) had great chemistry and their interplay kept the movie going in the first half. Leslie Jones and Kate McKinnon, however, are basically comedy sketch actors and it shows. Jones does her usual thing adequately but McKinnon was given way too much latitude. I have a feeling that the cast was allowed to improvise and in some cases it turned out well such as McCarthy's reactions to Wiig's fawning over Chris Hemsworth. McKinnon was permitted to ham it up, though, and her antics were distracting if not outright annoying. This is a common trait among SNL performers for whom overdoing it is often the only way to stand out in a crowded cast. A decent director would have had her dial it way back. McKinnon is still an order of magnitude better than Hemsworth though. As the highest profile name in the cast, I think he was indulged to modify his character according to his own comedic sensibilities and the result is consistently lame. Again, a better director would have known how to manage his cast.",Ghostbusters
624,southbase,It's because they don't make them like they used to,7,6 August 2016,"Fitfully-paced but ultimately-raucous reboot of the 1984 Ivan Reitman Ghostbusters lacks the superb technical & satiric polish of the original but does make for a dopily-urban/paranormal comic montage. Now inherited by a new female quartet of frustrated researchers (including the ropey, wittily-uncomfortable Kristen Wiig), a technical tinkerer and a Transit booth employee, the new Ghostbusters girls--who take a bit too much time 'trying on' the old franchise in what's supposed to be a scarily building adventure; remembering Mr. Reitman had earlier in his career directed a gruesome black comedy for American International, 1973's CANNIBAL GIRLS--discover a hotel employee who's connected metaphysical power-lines undergirding NYC's geography and opening a massive interdimensional portal to unleash thousands of variable-sized ghosts to destroy the city. Directed by SPY's Paul Feig, the film's zesty use of locations, good-to-indifferent staging (perhaps constricted by the very numerous effects-scenes requirements), and increasingly-brisk editing makes good use of its comedienne-actresses (although, oddly, Melissa McCarthy seems to defer to her fellow cast members much more than her earlier work with Mr. Feig, resulting in Leslie Jones' more outspoken Patty Tolan unexpectedly becoming the highlight of many scenes) and spunky support cast. The result is more of a series of knowing sketches stitched together well using the first film's basic imprimatur instead of the comically-ascending epic crisis of the original Harold Ramis (I would think he would be pleased by his cutely-snarky inheritor here, Kate McKinnon, who ends up growing on you)/Dan Aykroyd screenplay, but also needing the artistic filtering provided by the original's superb master craftsmen (John DeCuir, Laszlo Kovacs, Elmer Bernstein). By the end, when the team has finally gelled together very well and has a much more equal chemistry, you accept them for finally getting it instead of the original team's almost-instantaneous fourth-wall satirical viewpoint and PhD-minded, collaborative resolve. Fun, respectful, professional, hysterical-in-moments, GHOSTBUSTERS (2016) should get it right in the sequel with a tighter cast but it is possible in this day & age this is the best we could have hoped for.",Ghostbusters

627,Gloobey,Listen to them all at your peril...,8,14 August 2016,"Never - probably! - in the history of cinema has such a concerted campaign been undertaken by so many people who have obviously not seen the film to discredit a movie. Well, I may be wrong about that, there may be a historical precedent that I am unaware of, but I'm sure you get what I mean. Now, quite why so many would have you believe this movie stinks, I really can't say. It doesn't matter anyway, because this movie very definitely doesn't stink.Is it as good as the 1984 original?

I can see how you'd hate it if you were trying to hate it though.Yes, in the original movie, the 4 characters were men, and in this one, they are women. This is all fine if you take it that simply. I can understand the frustration of it being implied that a female-led film can only be successful if it's based on a male-led one. But honestly I think that's too much reading into it. If you just think it's downright stupid to reboot a film, that's fine too - originality is always nice. If you're just angry because it's women, then try to recognise that this was an attempt to put women in the driving seat, a good thing which hasn't been done as much in the past.

629,starry42,An absolutely atrocious insult to a beloved franchise.,1,14 May 2018,"This new Ghostbusters movie may have worked if they had done one simple thing. Made it a ""passing of the torch"" continuation of the previous films with the surviving members of the old team training a new younger team to take over the business. But instead Paul Feig decided to sweep the originals under the rug in favor of his own retelling. The result was ""Bridesmaids with Proton Packs"", and that is most certainly not a compliment. In order to understand why this movie fails, it's best to look at each individual element. Starting with:The CastThe cast is unimpressive, to say the least. The breakout star is Kate McKinnon, who's character, a wacky engineer named Holtzmann, has gained somewhat of a cult following. While I did get a few chuckles out of the character here and there, her schtick did get old after awhile. Kristen Wiig can be funny in the right roles, but sadly this was not one of those roles. She often seemed uninterested like she did not want to be there, and honestly I wouldn't blame her. Melissa McCarthy was the same character she usually plays, and I personally have never found her funny. This was no exception. Leslie Jones, much like McKinnon, did get some chuckles from me at times, but as most could already tell from the trailers, she was basically just the ""loud black woman"" stereotype. The worst performance without a doubt was (unfortunately) provided by Chris Hemsworth as the brain dead receptionist, Kevin. I was really hoping, based on the trailers, that he might possibly be the best thing in the movie, but he was quite honestly the worst, not that I particularly hold Hemsworth accountable. His character was written poorly, and many of the things he did made me cringe more than laugh.The VillainThe villain of this movie is a hotel handyman named Rowan, who his seeking revenge on humanity for having been bullied his whole life. He builds a device which brings spirits into our world, and he intends to wreak havoc with those spirits. Needless to say, Rowan is an extremely weak villain, especially when compared to the villains of the previous Ghostbusters films. The original film had Gozer, a powerful Sumerian god whose ultimate goal was the destruction of humanity. The second film had Vigo, a Carpathian warlock who intended to be reborn in order to seek world domination. These were both strong, developed villains, whereas Rowan just comes off as laughable, especially toward the climax, but more on that later. The Visual Effects The effects were cheesy and cartoonish. Words cannot be minced here. The various ghosts we see are unimpressive, and they all contain a strange hue of neon blue or green. Many have compared the effects to the ghosts in the live action Scooby Doo movies, but even that is giving it too much credit. In the original movies, the effects were done with puppets and the ghosts were made to look spectral as if they were really there on the set. Most of the original's effects still look great today, whereas in the reboot they already looked dated from day 1.The Plot*There will be spoilers in this section, but since I do not recommend this movie to my worst enemy, feel free to read ahead. Otherwise, stop right here. You have been warned.*The movie follows the same basic plot outline of the original, but not done nearly as well. Three of the characters start off as normal paranormal scientist who are called upon to investigate the hauntings of an old mansion where a tour guide was recently spooked. Before that, we get some unfunny jokes about wonton soup and queefing. Eventually we get to the mansion, where they look at the ghost in a scene very reminiscent of the library scene, only instead of getting scared off by a sudden transformation, one of them gets barfed on with slime. They end up losing there jobs at the university to go into business for themselves. They take up headquarters in an apartment above a Chinese restaurant, where Holtzmann works on some new equipment. They try testing out their new equipment at a subway station where they try to catch a convict ghost, but the equipment doesn't work and the ghost gets away. The MTA worker who called them, played by Leslie Jones, joins the team as a fourth member due to her knowledge of the city's history. She also gets them a car, which is a hearse from her uncle's funeral home. They also hire an idiotic receptionist named Kevin. They get their first real call from a concert hall where they end up battling a dragon ghost (yeah, it's THAT ridiculous) during a metal concert. They capture the ghost, and we get a random Ozzy Osbourne cameo. This was around the point in the original where they had captured Slimer and become heroes overnight, followed by a montage of them catching ghosts all over the city. Here we get know such cameo as they only intend to study the ghost. Eventually they find out about Rowan and that he is the one responsible for bringing the ghosts into our world. Before he can be taken by the police, he electrocutes himself on his machine, killing himself. He becomes a ghost which eventually possesses Kevin, who then goes to reactivate the machine. Eventually, the city is being overrun by ghosts, and the Ghostbusters must get to work. What follows is a sequence of some rather dull action, and a display of all sorts of different weaponry that Holtzmann was somehow able to afford to develop. These include sidearm guns, ghost grenades, a ghost gauntlet, and (I kid you not) a ghost CHIPPER. Eventually they confront Rowan, who gives up possessing Kevin, and then turns into (get ready, because this is really gonna hurt) a giant version of the ghost from the Ghostbusters logo. I won't go into any further detail, but it gets really ridiculous, especially the way they defeat him.The Bottom LineGhostbusters 2016 is a mess from start to finish. It should be worth noting that I have seen both the theatrical cut and the extended cut, and they are both terrible. The extended cut just has some altered dialogue and a ridiculous dance sequence involving the army. It does nothing to improve on the film, what little there was to improve anyway. Paul Feig clearly made this film with the intent to cater to people who like HIS films, and honestly I have not been a fan of his works. He clearly gave no consideration to fans of the franchise, and he and McCarthy even went so far as to insult the fans. That is not how you win an audience. This movie lacks everything that made the original a classic. Witty humor? Gone. Lovable characters? Gone. Believable chemistry among the actors? Gone. On top of that, it is played out as a straight up comedy. There are no attempts to be scary or taken seriously when necessary, unlike the original which had moments that can actually be terrifying to first time viewers. I didn't even mention the cameos, which honestly there isn't much to say about. The surviving cast members from the original make cameos as different characters than we are used to seeing them as, and they all seem forced and don't do much other than attempt to provide fan service (and fail miserably). There is even a bust of Harold Ramis at one point, and a tribute to him in the credits. But honestly, I think he was just rolling in his grave. This movie killed any chance the Ghostbusters franchise had of making a comeback, but we still have the originals to go back to at any time. Just cross the streams on this awful reboot. I give it one star, but that's just being generous. But hey, it is one more star than I gave ""Jack & Jill"", so it has that going for it.",Ghostbusters

Its like someone gave a 5 yr old a subject for a story and said write me a story and that's what they used for the plot. Oh and that 5 year old hates men.The movie is sexist, which doesn't offend me as a guy. But its not funny. Hemsworth's character is annoyingly stupid. And shooting the replacement for the ""stay puff"" marshmallow in the crouch is just tacky.The special effects are better than the original, but not really up to today's standards in my opinion. They could of been much better. The supersize ghost that replaces ""Stay Puff"" looks like crappy animatronics, why not use CGI? It would of been so much better.The story is choppy and how they get together to form a team takes up to much time. Also the team doesn't really seem to fit together at all. The characters just don't really mesh that well. And you feel like they picked 4 random people out of NY to be ghostbusters.I've saw most of the actors/actresses in other movies. And they are good in those. So i don't think it was the choice of cast but the way the characters were written. I think the cast did the best they could with what was written. It just didn't work well.Half way through the movie, i was waiting for it to be over. I was like can we wrap this up so i can go do something else? This movie did not do justice to the original.

636,Magic_Lantern,I ain't afraid of no remake,7,11 July 2016,"It's hard not to review the Ghostbusters reboot without commenting on the animosity that the marketing for the movie has received before its release. I totally accept that it's a tough job to effectively remake a classic film that's beloved by so many people (including myself) but I went into the cinema on opening night with an open mind and reasonably neutral expectations.The film is essentially a modern remake/reboot of the original 1980's comedy classic, only this time the lead cast are all female. It's really refreshing to see an almost completely female driven Hollywood blockbuster with varied, interesting, likable and often very funny women. The chemistry between the four leads is palpable but Kate McKinnon steals the show as kooky and ingenious scientist Jillian Holtzmann. I was, however, disappointed to see that the feminism in the film has gone so far as to have all male characters as either completely stupid or evil. Chris Hemsworth plays a male version of the stereotypical blond bimbo. He's actually often very funny and clearly looks like he enjoyed every minute filming his part. However, I would have welcomed at least one intelligent and rounded male character.Technically, the 3D effects are excellent with some clever use of letter-boxing; the visual effects are adequate and the score and soundtrack is lively with perhaps an excessive use of covers of the original Ghostbusters theme song.I had a lot of fun with Ghostbusters, the laughs come fast enough and the cast chemistry holds proceedings together. There's a dip in pace in the middle act due to the thin plot but things pick up again quickly for a rousing finale. I know many of you will have a concern that this movie will destroy a classic. Honestly, it won't. It's not exceptional but it's lots of fun and worthy of your time.7/10",Ghostbusters

And I would like to point out that I think director Paul Feig's movies such as the hilarious Bridesmaids (7.0) is indeed a good comedy flick, but by comparing the original and his previous movies, this is busting with bad acting, poor comedy and terrible CGI.* Characters: Im gonna make this quick, Melissa McCarthy and Kristen Wiig are hilarious actors and comedians and they deliver none of it in this movie. Im not gonna lie, I did laugh, at the stupidity and fart jokes... Kate McKinnon's character was another stupid one, however she does deliver the action the movie was in need of. And as for Leslie Jones, I am disgusted by the public's behaviour towards her. OK the movies bad but theirs no need to put hate and threats on her? OK she wasn't funny but hey neither are your insults!Kevin: Chris Hemsworth is the charm of Hollywood and I must admit, that his actions and roles are so stupid, I will admit I was always laughing. He's talented and definitely the highlight of the movie.Rowan North: I was hoping for a bit of story with the villain, but it was pure dumb...The Old Gang!: I loved seeing everyone from the original comeback in for a cameo, (R.I.P Harold Ramis) however I thought they were the original team that inspired the girls, oh well...* Plot & Design: Ghostbusters has a predictable and unoriginal plot, that tries so hard to deliver entertainment. The ghost themselves have terrible visuals and sound awful weird? I thought I was watching Godzilla for a second? The music on the other hand is rather catchy.* Im more angry at the public who voted either a 1 or a 10 because I believe we all know that 'most' of those votes are not proper opinions. IMDb is a great voting systems and these people are abusing it. First Batman V Superman, Dawn Of Justice (6.7), then Warcraft (6.7) and now this. I know people have their opinions, but this year has been an all out thearte war. I feel like its the feminist against the sexist and neither of them are looking at the movie as a whole.

(This should tell you all)I would not suggest to pay for cinema tickets. If you really want to see it, rent it or whatever. Find a cheaper solution, to chip away from the disappointment you will feel after watching it.Pros: The ""Suck it"" joke from the university made me LoL - Kate McKinnon made a very interesting character, but i am inclined to think that she seemed that way because all the other characters where so plain/non interestingContra: - Man hating trash jokes ( mind-boggling idiotic male secretary, a young man shits his pants when he saw a ghost but the women are not fazed at all, the evil character is a male that was bullied in life, the new device that she created ""nutcracker"", shooting a ghost in the ""d**k"" etc.. ) - the characters seemed to not have a thing in common. Even the two friends (Melissa McCarthy and Kristen Wiig) had no ""friends"" feeling to them. Very plastic feeling to the characters. - Somehow they had money to build stuff that would need Elon Musks fortune to fund. It was built by a person with 0 backstory in this. AND there is no evolution in the tech. She just improves tech from one day to another like some sort of prodigy that can build cast iron accessories/materials out of her behind from one day to another. - It feels like a cheap parody of Ghostbusters.As i said, if you do not want to give money on something that does not deserve it, please don't go to the cinema to see it. Choose cheaper solutions or don't even try. The movie ""Keanu"" has better rating and seemed better than this.... . Just sayin' .",Ghostbusters
645,monica-73379,As it should be!!,9,3 February 2017,Why is everyone being so hard on this movie and on these ladies??? This movie is super cute and exactly what it should be!! It's ghostbusters everyone and its fantasy and it has four very talented and funny actresses!!!!! Seriously Melissa mcarthy is one of the funniest female comedian actor of all time and then you pair her up with Kristen .....EVEN BETTER AND FUNNIER!!!!!! They're both hilarious!!! Kristen WIig is a scientist and her and Melissa mcarthy wrote a book on paranormal stuff and they reunite and ghosts start popping up and they form a team and deal with it !! Of course the story is predictable but we know this because of the other ghostbusters movies !! But it's still funny and well written and deserves a chance for a light hearted comedy and the younger ones will also love it ! Honestly if you just wanna watch a funny silly light hearted movie with ghosts then I highly recommend this !,Ghostbusters
646,tempestnyx,Hilariously Good | Review of 'Ghostbusters' (2016 Film),8,23 September 2016,"Now I know that there has been so much stupid controversy over this film but let me just say this: all of that is utterly stupid. I've seen the original, I love the original, and to be quite frank, while this movie may be a reboot with an all-female cast, it's hilarious. These women are funny, they have the right chemistry with one another and they bring their own creativity to this film. These actresses are not trying to be the original cast, while their parts may mirror the original cast, they bring something new to the characters, something new to the Ghostbusters franchise. Even Chris Hemsworth's character is different than the original Annie Potts character from the original. They are very different because the actors are being themselves, they are bringing their own unique hilarity to the film rather than rehash what was already done spectacularly, and in my book, that's awesome.Too many reboots/remakes make the same mistake of just redoing the movie shot by shot. Look at Psycho and The Omen. Both of those movies were redone with no originality, they just remake the movie with updated special effects (if needed) and redo the whole movie exactly like the original, shot for shot. Why bother remaking it at all then if no one is going to do anything different? This film stepped away from that and gave the story new characters with new motivations and a new villain. The story also kept the humor and paid homage to the original in several hilarious ways.The writers knew what they were doing here. They created a hilarious film for a new generation of viewers, and it doesn't slam on the original. This film had everything that made the original great with it's own charm to it. At the end of the day, it was hilarious.Admittedly this was a CGI-heavy film but that didn't allow the story to be lost, and it wasn't a complex story either, it was simple. They didn't try to hard and instead left it up to the actors to deliver the film the way it should be delivered, and these actors, they didn't fail.McCarthy, Wiig, McKinnon, and Jones were perfect. These actresses were hilarious! They left me and the theater I was in, laughing almost non-stop. Even Hemsworth, he was great, I loved him in this movie playing the adorable idiot. He was perfect, he played that part perfectly.Honestly, give this movie a chance because it deserves it and deserves a sequel. It left me wanting one. (★★★☆ | A+)",Ghostbusters
647,wavybracket,Worth a look,5,7 August 2018,"This movie started out with a big problem. It has to live up to being a follow-up to one of the great iconic movies of the 1980s. But that shouldn't have stopped it being a good film in its own right. It has a decent cast, nice-looking CGI effects and even cameos from several of the original's cast.
But then it ran into a problem so many re-boots and re-makes run into. It is being made by people who have no idea what made the original so great and who see it more as a quick buck rather than a chance to re-imagine an old franchise. Though it entertains, it's a lot better than most of the recent Hollywood re-boots and there's the odd moment of genuine humour, it's still just a typical cash-cow. Compared to the complex personalities of the original team, the four new Ghostbusters are all one-note characters (one of them seems to think ""eccentric"" means simply staring boggle-eyed through comedy-nerd glasses). Just about everyone else in the movie is there simply to be irritating. Most of the humour is just low-brow, and the horror is uninteresting. There are no images that come close to rivalling the memorable designs of the original two films, and you come away feeling nothing for the characters. Worth a look as a curio for fans of these kinds of movies, and the cast do the best with the spartan material they're given, but it's hardly the kind of thing for repeated viewings.",Ghostbusters

For me what let me down a little was the final descent into the unblooming flower as I like to call it, when Abby rescues Erin and they ascend back into the real world via a ""rope"" of some fashion.It was much too personal. There's a line you shouldn't cross in a comedy between the comedic and personal, the most personal thing being a relationship between two people, obviously. For this climax to occur between two of the three Ghost Busters was exclusive of the others, which was the major shortcoming of this movie.From a masculine point of view, perhaps.I don't see this movie having a sequel. I don't think it requires one. It is great as a standalone. (I would like to see more ""Ghostbusters"" incarnations.) The comedy of the movie was on-spot and the girls were cute as buttons. I would give it an A+ if I had a grade to give.I did enjoy the ghosts. I think some may not understand just how peculiar the supernatural can be.",Ghostbusters

Why change a winning team?' But then I saw the movie and it was hilarious. I don't know what I liked the most: the little winks to the old movies, 'dumb blond' Chris Hemsworth or goofy Kate McKinnon. This was a comedy just liked it's supposed to be, with original characters and a lighthearted plot. I loved the interaction between the four Ghosbusters and nothing felt like it was a flat copy of the original.Honestly, I'm ashamed for these people who decided beforehand not to like this movie and trash it even after seeing it. These are people who are set on thinking women can't be funny and who are trying to relive their childhood experience with the old movie. Well guess what: the past is over and if you would be the age your are now and saw the original again in the eighties you wouldn't like it anymore.

You can tell the cast is compromised of experienced comedians. With an easy plot to follow, the movie is carried by the personalities of the actresses, who bring their characters to life with amazing energy and enthusiasm. Kate McKinnon was by far my favorite, taking over the role is the oddball engineer and making it her own. Although the story seemed rushed, I've found that problem in many films released these past two years. You can tell it was edited to make the story move faster. However, there aren't any pointless dramatic or romantic moments to interrupt the comedy, and the musical score mostly consists of various dance songs. So feel free to sit back with some popcorn and enjoy a basic, entertaining film that keeps the spirit of the original.",Ghostbusters

You were so loud and so persistent the cast & director pretty much had no choice but to acknowledge you. I know you could have used that energy to focus on something you like, but you powered through and pitched a fit all over the internet. Congrats.Believe it or not, this movie wasn't Feminist Propaganda or some kind of Man-Hating Manifesto (Or should I say WOmanifesto, bazinga). It was a fun summer movie with a lot of good laughs & even some scares. I really enjoyed how the main cast interacted with each other, they really have great chemistry. The characters were fleshed out and interesting. Kate McKinnon was one of the best parts. She had a fun energy a lot of funny lines. I will say that I didn't really like Chris Hemsworth's character. His dopey dumb guy act got old a little too quickly. Is this movie perfect? Of course not. But it's got heart and it's entertaining.

657,E-Hortn,Perfectly good waste,1,13 January 2017,"I have seen the old Ghost Busters movies, and sure, they don't add up to my top list among the greatest. They ain't flawless, if I say so. But they have something, something that makes you smile. I remember the first sceen in the basement of the library, when I watchted it as a kid. That scared me, even if it wasn't that scary. And now as a grownup, I can enjoy that moment and laugh. Because it has stood the test of times. It still works! I actually get a bit scared, even if I watched it so many times. And at the same time, I laugh, because it is so well executed.When they announced the new Ghost Busters movie, I got really excited. I like some of the actress, and I think Kristen Wiig is a diamond in the rough. She has a weird way of acting, but it suits her and makes for some great comedian moments. I made this ideas about what the movie would be about, how they would incoperate the old Ghost Busters into the new. Aw man, thay have so many good things going for them. Served on a silver platter! ... But that was in my head, my idea of what this movie COULD be.Then I watch it, and I cant believe how they managed to butcher the Ghost Busters franchise so bad.First of all, I do not have anything against the female leads. Like I said, one of them is on my top 10 favorite female actress. I blame the writers and directors!What was that first intro, and what is that font? ""Ghostbusters""... The music starts playing, it is that old song. ""If there something strange, in your.........."" MUTE Whait, what now? So they add a text and play the iconic song from the old movies. But only for a brief moment. Then it is cut, just like that. It feels like the director actually don't want to use that song, but still have to add it for the old fans that watched the old movies. ""Hey, give them like 5-10 seconds of the themesong, that will probably do...""And this is just the intro, but it sets the standard for the rest of the film.* Stiff acting, without any chemistry. * Weird cutting of the scenes. (lets repeat that scene 4 times, when the ghost gets hit by a train, in case they missed the first time) * Bad timing. * Sad CGI. (That skyscraper did not really look real to me)But through the movie, they have potetial for some great moments. But they actually don't seem to notice them. They just say: Skip it! And moves on to another scene. When the character Erin Gilbert talks about her childhood and her memories of the first encounter of a ghost. Why not actually use that to set the tone. Why didn't you start of the movie with that? I would have loved to actually get some background to at least one of the main characters.And again, I know it isn't the worst thing about this film. But how could you say that those CGI skyscrapers look real?The film just keeps on struggling on so many levels. From the stiff acting, weird one-liners, lack of feeling etc.But the worst thing by far is the story it self. From the writer to the director. They have not manged to create something that stands up to the old films. Not by far! This is not the best they could have done and it's sad to see that they wasted a perfectly good moment to shine!",Ghostbusters
658,syllopsium,Occasional diamonds that shine out of the rough,5,17 July 2016,"Ghostbusters (2016) is not, despite what some people are posting, an awful film. Neither is it excellent - taken as a whole its highs and lows resolve to a completely average film. In many ways it strongly resembles Ghostbusters 2, which wasn't a great film.Thirty years of advancement in special effects has made for some brilliant action sequences, the visuals are far better than in the eighties.The decision to have Kate McKinnon's character go full mad scientist was a brilliant one, and if there is a sequel, some experimentation in Ghostbusting would be a definite improvement over the original.The plot also hangs together reasonably well, and there's little to complain about acting wise.Where it all falls down is the script, the direction, editing, and the mixture of characters. The humour is much more in your face and less sarcastic than the original, the camera continually swings between characters rather than using wide shots to show the interaction between the characters at that point in time. The pacing is off, and the scenes do not mesh together smoothly.It just isn't as funny, and doesn't capture the last chance nature of the original team getting by on a wing and a prayer. Neither does it feature a straight comedy lead - Harold Ramis was absolutely essential in providing a contrast for the original team.Then there's Lesley Jones' character. Surely she could have been given a better script? In the original Ernie Hudson plays a black guy who applies for a job, and copes as well as a guy thrust into an unusual situation would do. Not so in this film, where there's a contrived method of getting her involved in the team, and her role is slapstick and shouting.The main villain is lacklustre, too. True, his actions are consistent in the plot, but it would have been far better to have someone a little more flamboyant. That would have provided further opportunities for comedy later on in the film.With a little more effort it could have been a good, but not great film, as it is it's relentlessly average.",Ghostbusters
659,ben_jimenez,Not what It could of been,4,22 July 2016,"First I'll say I loved the original Ghostbuster's movies. They were original, fun to watch, had a funny story, and I understood where they were going during the course of the film. This movie was totally opposite, I didn't understand where the movie was trying to take me. I didn't get why the characters had to yell their dialog through most of the movie. I also don't think these characters where developed much. I think their motivation was simply ""you're hunting ghosts"". The jokes were not funny at all, it was as if this screenplay was written in a weekend and then touched up a month or so before production. I guess we now know that you can't always succeed with comedians in a comedy. Isn't that ironic that even when using comedians the production team still couldn't make this movie funny. I guess you could say it was like an episode of Saturday Night Live, the non funny years. The bad acting really came out and I've often noticed that any movie that Chris Hemsworth is in aside from Thor really sucks. Hacker, sucked. In The Heart of The Sea, sucked. Red Dawn, sucked. Dude take an acting class, one with feeling, you can't always get by with your looks. Also on a side note, the costumes in this remake were not that good, very poor design. The costumes where part of the heart of the Ghostbusters. If they were a sign of things to come, then what was coming wasn't going to be very good, and it wasn't.Well in the end just like other remakes (Total Recall, Fright Night, Conan The Barbarian, etc.) this did not live up to the name. I wish it would of, but at least it's come and past, like my upset stomach I had the other day.",Ghostbusters

Although ideally there should be a GB team of different genders, the fmale Ghopstbusters angle was a good idea to keep things new and interesting if handled properly. i was however concerned when I heard that Paul Feig (of Bridsmaids and Spy fame) was wrting the screenplay, as I found neither of his movies particularly funny. Still, I hoped for the best. Sadly, the movie was a meandering catalogue of rehased ideas and failed attempts at humor. Aside from a few wxceptions most of the jokes fell very flat. The jokes were so flat and uninventive that they seemed to have been made up in the spot, mid-filming, as if they weren't written at all but lazily improvised. The actors were funny but the lines they were delivering just weren't tickle-inducing. Another mistake I feel they made was to ognore the previous existence of other team of ghostbusters and have cameos from the original GB cast playing other people. The movie should have worked, if only to shut down the ridiculous misogynist outcries of indignation, but sadly the movie ended up by being mediocre in all counts - the story was a meandering mess, the jokes were poor and flat and the special effects underwelming. A real missed opportunity.",Ghostbusters
662,dan-willi84,Average. Not A Great Movie.,1,25 March 2017,"Ghostbusters was average. Not a great movie. Kristen Wigg, Melissa McCarthy, Leslie Jones and Kate McKinnion didn't have good on-screen chemistry. The acting was bad. Melissa McCarthy and Kate McKinnon were annoying. Jillian Holtzmann (McKinnon) looked as if she could had been the offspring of Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis and her character behaved like she had ADHD. Chris Hemsworth provided some good comic relief and he did have his moments. The film had some good nods and references to the original film. Some of the film was funny, but silly and some parts of the film I did find funny and did make me laugh. The film wasn't scary. Only 1 scene made me jump. The ghosts weren't scary and Slimer was badly computer animated. Ghostbusters is defiantly not one of the best films of 2016. I didn't think think it was as bad as Deadpool and Batman VS. Superman: Dawn of Justice. But it's defiantly one of the worst films of 2016. It lacks the magic of the classic 1984 film and it could had been better.",Ghostbusters
663,rptrezise,Lives up to all of the negative publicity all too well.,1,1 October 2016,"Watched this last night. I put it on, thinking that perhaps it'd be OK. Fine. Not the best of approaches but hey, it worked for Lesbian Vampire Killers and I actually enjoyed two or three lines in that! Bad movies do sometimes have their charms and, despite lukewarm reviews, I was willing to give it a go. It riffs off the original in any number of ways, which, in itself, is not a bad thing. But it doesn't do so with any particular style and, quite frankly, goes downhill rapidly after a start that could've come from Scooby Doo 2. Cameos come and go, a pleasant nod to Egon/Ramis with a bust in one shot. Murray telephones in his role and Ackroyd has definitely seen better material. McCarthy is McCarthy - no change there. Still plain speaking and 'sassy' with more than a hint of 'bloody annoying loudmouth' about her. The supposedly kooky technician, Kate McKinnon, is just dumb and phenomenally irritating. She doesn't seem to know where to take the performance at all. Veering from odd genius to goofball but with no charm in any respect. Kristen Wiig plays Kristen Wiig in exactly the same performance as she has in so many movies before and if Leslie Jones thinks her Twitter feed comments were racist, (which they undoubtedly were - along with her own observations on white people BTW) she obviously never considered her performance too deeply as a stereotype of a 'black mama' that even Martin Lawrence would balk at delivering. For a movie which complained about misogyny and general sexism in response to the backlash to the all female leads, it's kind of ironic that all men in this movie are weird, stupid and have nothing to offer, aside from Hemsworth who's just eye-candy. The final battle scene is a mess of pointless gadgetry and poor effects which just looks like Feig figured that more was, well, more. If I could sue them for the waste of my life that this film was, I would. But I'm off to watch some other piece of trash and hope it'll be an improvement. It'd have to sink to lows of Showgirls levels to even come close to being as poor as this. As for the after credits scene - PLEASE GOD NO!",Ghostbusters
664,tubezzz,A disgrace to the uniforms.,1,27 June 2017,"My favorite movie of all times (yes, i said it) is the 1st Ghostbusters film. I've watched it on my VCR dozens of times back in the day when i was a kid, and i'd watch it again with anyone who wants to have a good time today.By looking at the cast of the 2016 film i already knew it's going to be a disaster so i avoided it. A few days ago it was on cables and against my better judgement i actually tried watching it. as expected, this thing was a trainwreck. I barely made it to the 20/25 minute mark and couldn't take it anymore. It wasn't remotely funny. the actresses are beyond terrible.Wayyyy too much pseudoscience nonsense and i even hated how they had to add lighting effects to the proton packs and the PKE meters. it looked really bad. not to mention all the new devices they come up with (that was the part where i couldn't take it anymore- when they test drive the new gizmos).If you're here to check the reviews do yourself a favor and avoid this flick at all costs, and if you never watched the 1st GB movie, make sure to add it to your bucket list :)",Ghostbusters
665,ralph_2ndedition,How is this offending anyone...?,8,2 August 2016,"OK, so yesterday I had a burger, and then went to see the Ghostbusters-movie. Sat front row, in the middle. Ate some tasty chocolate candy bars, drank my chosen beverage (tried a mineral water infused with a taste of a popular chocolate pastry – it was disgusting!).It was a matiné showing, on a smoldering hot, picture perfect summer day – so no, it wasn't packed. Not by a long shot. Still, I did share that front row with three other people, and the theater was probably at least half full. It was insanely difficult to shake the feeling of slight trepidation, this was after all the first time I went to see a movie not ONLY because I thought it was going to be great (I did think that though), but also because so many people had decided to hate it – on general principle – that I wanted to see it just to make a statement; You CAN NOT judge a movie unseen!There really is no end to the stupidity among the people calling themselves ""real Ghostbusters fans"". Oh they will say that it isn't the female leads that bothers them, it is the story, or the effects, or the humor, or simply the fact that it doesn't star Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis (2014) and Ernie Hudson. But trust me, most of them are bothered – to one degree or another – by the female leads.So, there I was. Expecting to be entertained, hoping that I would be THOROUGHLY entertained. And guess what All these small minded people judging the film way before it ever came out – they are MORONS!The opening scene set the tone pretty well, being somewhat eerie and having a nice jump scare, leading right into the title and the theme tune. Somewhat mirroring the original's librarian-scene. This follows throughout the movie, with humor added to the mix.I'll skip walking you through the story, as I run the risk of spoiling things, and cut right to the chase In the original I had to suspend disbelief when it came to Venkman getting as far as he did without studying, and the department they were at at the university staying open as long as it did. There was also the problem with the firehouse – as rundown as it was it would still have been a fortune, even back in 1984 – a problem dealt with in the reboot. There was also very little said about the four 1984 leads. You knew basically nothing about them, except that Venkman was a possible sexual harassment suit recipient. The characters of Ghostbusters 2016 actually got some meat, meaning I felt I got to know more about them, who they were, where they came from and why they ended up where they are. They also made more sense to me, in a way I love the initial dynamic between Erin (Kristen Wiig) and Abby (Melissa McCarthy), you get a real sense of bitter history there, and it was great seeing Melissa McCarthy in a position of actual power. I also love the fact that they gave Patty (Leslie Jones) a real story, instead of letting her succumb to the Ernie Hudson fate of having basically no character. One of my favorite moments though, was right at the end, where (and I'm not gonna give too much away here) they let the awesome but basically cartoon character of Jillian Holtzmann (Kate McKinnon, rocking it out!) give a real tear jerker of a speech.Also, Chris Hemsworth has to be mentioned! He plays the part of Kevin, the Busters air head receptionist. Kevin spends his time not answering the phone, trying to chose which photo of himself makes him look most like a doctor and drinking (and spitting out) coffee. I really like Hemsworth as Thor, but this was another side of him. The guy is hilarious! More comedies please, Mr.Hemsworth!I know the effects have taken a lot of heat, what with them looking all glowing green and blue. But I really don't mind it – and the fact (yes, FACT, straight out of director Paul Feig's mouth in a Total Film interview) that there is very little CGI involved when it comes to the ghosts and monsters I find encouraging. The glowing doesn't bother me one bit, and in comparison with the original the effects are consistent – adhering to one style throughout!The people whining – HATING – on this are usually very quick to claim that they wanted a sequel, not a remake, that they wanted the principal actors from 1984 in the lead roles, and also that this movie is basically feminists hating on men. What I don't understand is this; Ghostbusters 2016 is executive produced by, among others, Ivan Reitman (original director of Ghostbusters 1984) and Dan Aykroyd (one of the principal actors from the original). It is visibly supported (you figure it out) by Dan Aykroyd, Bill Murray, Ernie Hudson, Sigourney Weaver and Annie Potts (all starring in the 1984 original) and the whole thing is dedicated to Harold Ramis (the only one of the four original leads to not be alive today).SO WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM!?This wasn't the best movie I have ever seen, but it was pretty damn entertaining! Entertaining enough to make me laugh out loud several times, and it made me choke back a tear (believe it or not).It has also made me make space on my shelf, right next to the original.",Ghostbusters

668,jebuslachaine,omg just why,1,24 July 2016,OK to be honest this is my first review I ever did for a movie so bare with me OK this movie was just sad the ghosts just looked way too cartoonie then real (they should have used the same CGI that was in the originals) I don't mind the idea of a new cast but y in gods name would u have them not a tie in to the original cast is beyond me Intro was retarded and just mind blowing bad The plot was pointless and dull and the only thing I was looking forward to was the ending creds to roll by In closing if u want to see this then sure plz do but don't expect it to be anything remotely close to any thing ghistbusters related any knock off of ghistbusters would be more ghistbusters then this I only seen it for my own courisoty to see how bad it is and just omg wow....,Ghostbusters
669,schmidtp-54221,More Hollywood ripped off garbage...don't bother,2,21 October 2016,"It seems Hollywood is really, really out of new movie ideas. So why not do a remake? All well and good. Works for some movies and updates can be good with new CGI and effects. And that's about the only (and I'm really stretching it) good thing about the movie - the effects. Other than that, lets just get the latest funny female stars of the time, rehash the script, throw in some originals for a cameo (did Bill Murray and Dan Ackroyd actually see any of what they were putting their names to?) and make it really LAME. After hearing that the movie was supposed to be good, it was one of those - you enjoyed the original and give the sequel a go movies. But 20 min in you're already wishing you'd switched it off in place of even a B grade movie. This rehash bored me to sleep. No laughs, lame acting and lame script. The effects were good, but with such garbage who would even notice? About the only character I sort of enjoyed was the quirky Ion character of Kate McKinnon, but even that wasn't enough. Don't go off the critics, this is one lame excuse for a rehash move. Just download it if you must, don't waste your time or money on this turd.",Ghostbusters
670,icecaralee,Hilarious. Fresh,9,25 October 2021,"I was cracking up the whole movie. The cast killed it and did a good job of paying respect to the OG film. I think people who didn't like it are trying to make the movie more epic than in needs to be. The original was silly funny, this one plays off that with definite improv techniques visible and I was very entertained which is the point.",Ghostbusters
671,Jerry_Sprinkle,Doesn't justify its own existence,1,11 July 2016,"Awful but not necessarily for the reason you would expect.Despite some early reviews I've read or watched I didn't find the movie to be anti-male. There was nothing offensively anti-man in it that wasn't something I've already seen before and laughed off a million times. Unfortunately that's part of the problem this movie has with humor creativity. There was nothing there to laugh about.Thankfully Patty Tolan isn't a walking/talking stereotype. They made her a New York City historian instead of a caricature with ""street smarts"". Sadly, they didn't do her any other favors. Nor were the other characters flushed out at all.Kristen Wiig and Melissa McCarthy play a pair of old friends who re-unite but I never get much of a sense they were anything but aware they were in a movie. They try to riff and play off each other but it kind of falls flat.Kate McKinnon's character stands out the most in this movie. The character just seemed too weird in an unrealistic way. She seemed to try chewing up scenery any time she was on a call sheet, even if she didn't have much to say. She didn't feel like she fit into what was happening.One actress that stood out to me was Cecily Strong. Cecily Strong stood out to me the same way Kristen Wiig first stood out to me in Knocked Up. She only has a very small role in the movie but she's able to be convincing and funny without making it seem like she's in on the joke.The performances weren't bad per se, they were just very underwhelming all-around. As a result, the film itself does not succeed.I did like how the ghosts look in the movie. I also like the choice the filmmakers make at the end regarding the classic logo. However I have to be harsh on this movie because it's a reboot that ultimately did not need to be made.Not only did they attempt to reboot a comedy (tell the same joke twice in a row and see how well it works the second time - comedy is a very very delicate thing and you need to respect the audience) but they went for a movie that originally caught lightning in a bottle. I don't even think Ghostbusters II did enough to justify existing. Maybe the lessons we didn't learn back when the sequel was made are the same lessons we won't learn from the reboot.",Ghostbusters
672,desiner1,Figured I'd give it a second chance....,5,11 December 2020,After seeing it initially when it came out and hating it I figured I'd give it a second chance. I thought maybe my love of the original might have biased me to this newer version. WRONG. This movie is every big the disaster I thought it was. I lay the full blame for this on the writer and director. The girls who are known for their comedy background came off stupid in most cases. Then there was the dumbass character that Hemsworth played. Yikes.,Ghostbusters
673,gmharris,So much fun!,9,23 July 2016,"Good reminder that the current trend where everything has to be a remake or sequel or tie-in doesn't have to be horrible. There were good nods to the first two movies, but these are their own people, and they are given more humanity. Good energy and willingness to just go with things. In this case, this especially meant letting Chris Hemsworth and Kate McKinnon do odd things that didn't necessarily add to the story, but did add to the charm. I know at least some ad-libbing was involved, and that may have added to a set where everyone felt supported and free.It's a minor thing, but there's a Jaws joke that really made me happy.",Ghostbusters

This is a really annoying yet satisfying fact. The greatness and glory of the originals are shown once again seeing these failed reboots. So pathetic compared to the original masterpieces. I will NEVER EVER go to see ANY reboots. It's a waste of time and money and hopes. What do film studios expect from these, really? I'm curious. It's a huge industry with masterminds and legends in their ranks. Yet they can meet so bad decisions. These reboots are supposed to be a humiliation to the originals, or what??

675,spotatoes,Gender-Swap? Politics? Forget Them; It's The Writing,2,9 March 2020,"Right, let's dispense with all this talk of political correctness are arbitrary gender-swaps - they just muddy the waters.Apart from two genuinely funny jokes right at the start of the movie, all the other jokes are annoyingly unfunny. They're annoying because their setups require leaps of logic that don't make sense, and maybe it's my pedantry, but I started counting how many times logic was elbowed aside in the name of ultimately mediocre jokes; it happens a lot. It became irritatingly distracting. Add to that, that you've got jokes - obviously improvised jokes - that lasted way too long and which, on the whole, fell flat, and you start to see why I was quite so irked.The writers, Paul Feig and Katie Dippold, also plainly think that, in order for these characters to be funny, they've all got to be stupid. For heaven's sake! These are supposed to be clever people, but they're not. With the exception of Kate McKinnon's Holtzman, everyone is unbelievably stupid.Talking of Kate McKinnon - bless her heart - she tries so hard to keep this film watchable. I could practically see the strain on her face. It's McKinnon that made me smile most whilst watching this, for which, she deserves a medal. It's her and her alone that kept me watching this otherwise irredeemably terrible movie.",Ghostbusters

677,su-49,The ratings are haunted: It is not so bad as it was rated,6,3 February 2018,"Well, actually the movie is entertaining. Though it is not masterpiece as original films, but it's watchable. It gives you a pleasant aftertaste (a day or two after you've watched it).I'm far from the American political hate culture and the permanent war of all against all, and may be I've probably just missed the point of the hate battle about some «evident» social engineering messages of the movie (too subtle for me). But I can see that the movie ratings have been downgraded technically by flooding the ratings with negative reviews written by single person or narrow group of such persons. There is a distinctive pattern in all the «1 of 10» ratings. Even if you post from different accounts (nicknames) it is hard to hide completely your personal features like vocabulary (or preferable choice of words). In the «1 of 10» reviews there are peculiar repetitions (see the phrase «dead on arrival», for example; the author (collective of authors) is nursing the happily found metaphor like a gem).As to political accusations like feminist mainstream politcorrect agenda verging on the brim of intolerance, I think it is an exaggeration. Yes there is a strong influence of the time. But I see nothing insulting in turning main characters in women. The pretty girl with professional makeup isn't less believable as a nerdy scientist 24×7 playing in their basements with their equipment and eating fast-food crap for years. But it is not much less realistic than man with face of Dan Aykroyd in the role. After all, it's fantasy about funny ghosts, phony technical stuff and physics. Why so serious?Actors are fine. Characters are fine (especially fine the Jillian Holtzmann (Kate McKinnon) clown scientist type. Fudge, where to find such girlfriend, huh?). I think it was not necessary to depict Kevin's (Chris Hemsworth) character so dumb. It deprives the movie proper tension and conflict(s) on the probable multi love lines. There could be many plausible causes why handsome guy should seek such low paid job (from civil status or background to personal features like incompatibility with corporative culture of big corporations, which is actually hostile to natural man traits). Just a touch of playful stupidity (like with Holtzmann) would be OK. It seems that authors of the script doesn't know what to do with fully functional man in the team and how to keep him from seizing the leadership and stealing the show. The authors just do not believe in their own women's characters at all (and in woman's leadership in the whole), so them try to protect their story by downgrading all men's characters. Though the story with leading women's roles can be sound and plausible (the main characters are depicted as scientists with the skills above the average, after all, and that's the core competence on which their business has based). You just need to quit a lazy stance and to do a proper work on your script and everything will add up without unnecessary constraints and overprotection.Jokes are decently dumb (the mini-performance with middle finger - yeah, that's how its usually is going on in top institutions and scientific departments, gimme you resume, please). Script is flat, hardly original (but what you want from a remake).I think the movie could be much better with just a little bit efforts on the part of story development. But it is a common problem of all Hollywood movies nowadays.",Ghostbusters
678,smithmjsjsmith,I'm a man and this movie was actually pretty good,8,29 September 2016,"I'm not the first one to admit that there are a lot of spam voters on IMDb.com. If they hear about a movie they don't like, they will automatically fly to the film's page on IMDb.com and give it 1 out of 10 scores without actually seeing the movie. I admit, I was a bit skeptical of the trailers for Ghostbusters (2016), they clearly didn't show the highlights of the movie in the trailer, but the full movie was much better than the trailer and that might have cost the movie the reputation it deserved. As a man, I obviously have nothing against a female cast, let's be honest, the original cast is too old to return and one of the original Ghostbusters passed away so there's never going to be a new movie featuring them as the lead. What I really love about this movie is that the women actually have a lot of chemistry, they seem to be very close friends in real life. They actually had more chemistry than the original Ghostbusters and to me that is very important, I love interesting characters.Although there are some flat jokes, most of them are pretty funny. People seem to forget that the original Ghostbusters had its funny moments and the new movie tries hard to give us a few laughs. I will admit that the film isn't as good as the original, but it's definitely worth watching and you should ignore the haters of the movie. Most of the people on this website who voted a score of 1 out of 10 for this movie were men and I bet none of them saw the movie. You have to provide a lot of reasons why you think the movie deserves an abysmal score like that. Give this movie a chance, don't hate on it because the leads are women or because it doesn't have the original crew. I am a huge fan of the Angry Video Game Nerd and have a lot of respect for James Rolfe. But this is one of the few times he was wrong, he should definitely watch this movie if he hasn't already seen it. I know he doesn't hate the movie because of the female leads, he hated it because the trailer wasn't as impressive as the movie. A first impression is very important and that cost the movie from earning hundreds of millions more. But seriously, just give the film a chance and you won't be disappointed.",Ghostbusters

680,johns6087,It's Pretty Bad...,3,6 November 2016,"OK so first of all I can't possibly overstate how much I hate a lot of the negative reviews for this movie. So many of them were/are - and should NOT be - about how the cast are female, and females aren't as funny as males, etc, etc, with a lot of misogynist hatred sprinkled in there. That drove me nuts. To read some of the comments that some of the female cast members received online - with at least one of them even having to cancel her Twitter account - was infuriating to me, period.That said, purely rating this as a movie experience, I was not very impressed. I thought the cast did fine with what they had but it just seemed very... uninspired? I thought the opening sequence with the skinny guy (the guy from the later seasons of The Office) was really good and was quite optimistic despite what I'd heart, but after that things seemed very by the numbers with pretty thin characters and frankly bad dialogue and crumby jokes. The cameos by old cast members (i.e. Bill Murray as a ghost debunk-er) were distracting and not very good.The effects were pretty great and the few laughs I had were good ones, but overall I was incredibly disappointed by this movie.

682,SciFighter,Just did not entertain us,2,23 July 2016,"It's not often I take the time to make reviews. As normally I don't listen to reviews, I like to watch movies for myself and form my own opinions.For me I have one simple rule did the movie entertain me for the time I was in watching it. Very simple, I am not like a lot of people go in looking for faults in movies or plot holes. I love a lot of movies many people would consider not very good films. When I go watch a flick I just want it to keep me entertained and forget about real life for a few hours, that's it..This movie did not entertain us at all the only part of the movie we enjoyed was Chris Hemsworth and I am not even a very big fan of his at all. The jokes Paul Feig and the cast had in this movie were just not funny. This is coming from someone who actually likes most of Adam Sandler's stuff as well. I also quite honestly found the movie pretty boring as well it just did not keep me interested in the slightest. I believe there has only been one movie I can remember that I walked out of in my life and this came close to being number 2.In fact after we watched this we went out to eat dinner, then went back to the theatre and watched Star Trek Beyond that we had planned to see today. The reason being was to wash that Ghostbusters movie out of our minds. Star Trek was fantastic, if your trying to decide for something to see this weekend watch Star Trek. I really think anyone giving this movie a 10 must be getting paid to review it.",Ghostbusters
683,rprice01,I Actually Enjoyed This One...,7,15 July 2016,"You know I really enjoyed Ghostbusters. It was not a groundbreaking movie of the summer, but it was not that bad either. I enjoyed the chemistry between all four characters, and I laughed quite a bit throughout the movie. It also had many great special effects and an interesting storyline. I definitely look forward to a sequel if they decide to create one.However you have to erase all memories of the first two Ghostbusters films in order to appreciate this one at all. They give homage to the past films, but this is a total reboot for a new audience . I have no problem with the ""female power"" message within this film. I do like strong female characters in action movies, so it did not bother me. The only thing I did not really like is that all of the male characters were either dumb, or had some type of strong obvious negative character trait. I don't think that a movie has to totally diminish the male characters in order to make the female character shine more. Why can't there be a balance? The main villain was interesting too, but they could've built him up more, because in the end he wasn't the most memorable to me. But otherwise I really enjoyed this movie.",Ghostbusters
684,dgattis5,I Want My Money Back,1,24 July 2016,"I knew from the very beginning that I wasn't going to like this movie. I had seen the trailer and commercials and thought ""Wow, there's no way in hell I'm gonna waste my money on that."" But, when the movie came out, my girlfriend talked me into taking her to see it. The film had been out for about three days when I took her. I bought our tickets, and we entered the auditorium. I noticed that we were the only two people there, but I figured that since this was such a big movie, and that we were a little early, more people will probably show up. That did not happen. So there we were, sitting in the theater, by ourselves, waiting for the movie to start. Once I saw the opening logos start up, I knew that I was going to be spending the next two hours of my life in hell! The humor was poorly written, the special effects were laughable, and it payed no respect to the source material. Don't get me wrong, I love all of the main actresses of this movie! They're usually very funny and very good at delivering comedy in just about everything they do. But that just wasn't the case for this movie. I don't blame them, I blame the writers and the director. We were about half way into the movie when my girlfriend said ""Why did they purposely make it so bad?"" I was shocked to hear that she didn't like it either, as she had previously been very enthusiastic about it. I asked her if she'd like to leave but she told me that she wanted to see if it would get better. So we sat there for a little while longer. I heard later from a few other people that the movie was sexist against men in place. I believe that that's a bit of an over-exaggeration, but I can definitely see where they're coming from. After sitting there for another half-hour or so, she finally said ""Nope! We need to get the hell outta here!"" Which we did. We then returned home, and watched the real Ghostbusters. All I can say is, I pray to God that they don't make a sequel, because this was just a bad idea that needs to be buried in the past.",Ghostbusters
685,johnbkaramazov,Heartbreaking.,1,14 July 2016,"I was originally going to give this movie a miss, but my boy had seen the trailers and was really excited to see the follow up to our favourite movie of all time. As a huge fan of the original, I have to judge it as a Ghostbusters film (which is only fair as the studio is trading off the franchise), rather than a generic Hollywood Summer Blockbuster. Well as a Ghostbusters movie it absolutely stinks. It's rotten.I've read quite a lot of official reviews that say it's better than GB2, in what universe I ask you? GB2 had serious structural flaws compared to the first, there's no doubt, but its jokes and set pieces are still some of the most iconic of the franchise. Seeing as how no one who has made this claim has in any way tried to back it up, let me compare the two right here and now. First the baddies. Vigo vs Rowan. No contest, Vigo - the Scourge of Carpathia, the Sorrow of Moldavia, conducting his evil bidding from a painting in Manhattan, wins hands-down. Rowan is a terrible baddie, he'll be forgotten a few months after the Blu-Ray release. So let's compare the good guys. GB2 relies on the magnificent chemistry between Murray, Aykroyd, Ramis and Hudson to drive it along and whatever the structural flaws, the chemistry is as strong as ever. Wiig, McCarthy, McKinnon and Jones do not share any chemistry, it's actually painful to see them on screen together. Even as individuals they fall far short of the original cast. If we take Wiig as an analogue to Murray, there's no contest; Murray gains a flawless victory. People are still quoting Venkman lines from GB2, ""bummer"", no one will be quoting Erin Gilbert in (nearly) 30 years time. The same is true for the rest of the cast head- to-head. To save time I'll just highlight the example of McKinnon, who I love on SNL, but couldn't bear in this movie. She's clearly the Egon character, but she phones it in, playing a generic 'kook' and going so over the top that it basically ruins half of the scenes that she's in. Again, McKinnon, like Wiig, has no funny or memorable lines such as 'lets see what happens when we take away the puppy' and her humour is weird for the sake of it, rather than the deadpan brilliance of the late Harold Ramis. Jones is simply loud and brash. The supporting characters are just regurgitated, worse versions of people from the originals, there isn't a single character in the movie who comes close to the creepy-comedy brilliance of Peter MacNichol's Janosz, one of the greatest, most iconic supporting characters in any comedy!So let's look at the structure and set pieces. If GB2 was structurally flawed, GB2016 ""should be condemned"", (see what I did there?) I don't want to spoiler the movie, so I'll keep to scenes and plot devices already revealed by the trailers. Firstly, the rock concert scene falls completely flat compared to the courthouse scene in GB2. The ghosts released by Rowan serve little purpose and lack the comedy mischief of the ghosts in the original, seemingly just there to give a use for the very obvious greenscreen effects that Feig uses much too liberally. Rowan's machine is a cheap cop-out and is in no way comparable to the absolutely terrifying and completely awesome river of slime flowing through the spooky abandoned subway. GB2 was all about creating some legitimate scares (Titanic docking!) and a feelgood factor which it did through some iconic set pieces. There is no feelgood factor to this new movie. It feels cheap in a nasty way and is surprisingly cynical for something that I've read is supposed to be aspirational in some way.I could go all day comparing the two but let's just say that GB2016 in no way measures up side by side to GB2. I suspect that the reason some reviewers are making that claim is to try and salvage something from this God-awful mess, so people will say 'hey, at least it's not the worst Ghostbusters movie.' It must be shilling because when you put all the elements of the two movies side-by-side, it's clear that despite its flaws, GB2 is simply better in every way than this lazy reboot. But here's the thing, my kid enjoyed it. He didn't like it as much as Ghostbusters, or even Ghostbusters 2, but he thought it was neat regardless. I think kids will like this film because it's flashy and the jokes are crude and obvious; adults who loved the subtle, dry wit of the original will probably be turned off by the listless, rehashed, gross-out humour and half-hearted performances. I have one more story to share that I think any parent might want to know before taking their child to see this film. When we came out of the cinema, my kid was in a funny mood that I've never seen him in before, half-hyped and half-pensive. I asked him if he was feeling alright and he said 'yeah', then there was this long pause and I could see him struggling with something. Eventually he turned to me and said, 'dad, when I grow up I want to be a lady'. I was pretty taken aback but I tried not to show it, instead I just said to him 'well you know you can be whatever you want to be sport; why do you want to be a lady, is it to be like the new Ghostbusters?'. And he just looked at me with eyes that seemed older than his years and said, 'no dad, it's because this film made me realise all guys are either stupid or evil, so it's better just to be a lady I guess...'My heart broke a little.",Ghostbusters
686,nyiri-timea,I don't get the hate,7,17 January 2017,"I really don't understand why this film is hated so much. It's a comedy. It's only purpose to be funny and entertaining and it is. Yes, some jokes are over the top, but the whole film and the plot is over the top, so there's nothing wrong with that. I liked the original version, but honestly I like this one even more. The female leads were funny and every one of them has a different personality (yes, over the top personalities but still it's fine) I think people want to be more than it is: it's a comedy that sole purpose is to entertain and make you forget your daily problems for a few hours, and it definitely achieves that purpose.",Ghostbusters
687,nightmarelyre,Surprisingly Pretty Awesome,9,27 July 2016,"Going in to this movie, I was rather skeptical of how good it would be. Not because of the leads being played by women mind, I think that being controversial is rather sad in 2016, but more due to the inherent nature of reboots and remakes, as well as speculations about overt racism gained from the trailers. At best I expected it to be an inoffensive modern-style ""quirky but not exactly funny"" type comedy movie, instead it turned out almost as good as the originals to me.The film have a similar plot structure to the first film as expected. A team of scientists who dabbles in the paranormal get sent to investigate a alleged haunting in a local public building, and when they find undeniable proof of the haunt after being attacked by a ghost they decide to start a ghost busting service. During the course of the movie, they pick up another member of their team, do various jobs and slowly uncover a bigger picture to explain why there is a sudden increase in ghostly activity around.The new cast of Ghostbusters were in of themselves a pleasant surprise. I am not familiar with the previous work of Leslie Jones, Kristen Wiig, Melissa McCarthy and Kate McKinnon, but they all do a great performance that punctuates most of the jokes nicely, and their on-screen chemistry helps tie the movie together and make it give the same feeling of teamwork and friendship that the originals did. Also thankfully, instead of just trying to emulate the personalities of the original team they were smart enough to make all of them new interesting characters in their own right, while still making sure they don't stray too far from the old team's dynamic.The movie also have a colorful gallery of amusing side characters, which helps keep the comedic pace of the film up while allowing the protagonists to partake in character building and drama at the same time. Of particular note is their dimwitted secretary, who's cartoon-ish stupidity is rather unbelievable from a story telling perspective, but as far as using him as a device for funny gags and jokes he is pure gold. If there is one character who could have maybe used a bit more depth though it would be the main villain, as his motivation seemed rather shallow, though I can see why they wanted to keep it straight forward as to not slog down the pace with needless exposition.The jokes themselves start off rather worrisome, utilizing toilet humor and goofy shenanigans that seems really out of place (and aren't very funny to boot), but after encountering their first haunting the humor thankfully starts to mature. Throughout the film a lot of creativity is put into setting up fun ideas for comedy that for the most part pays off, such as having a haunted Metal concert, playing with expectations regarding comparisons to the old films, and showing the Busters' ghost fighting equipment get gradually more ridiculous the more time they have to tinker with it.However, while I do consider this majorly a comedy film, it does action very well too. The ghosts themselves and the proton pack special effects look gorgeous in CGI, and the fact that it looks ""fake"" really doesn't bother me in this case as it makes perfect sense that ghosts wouldn't look ""realistic"" when they are spectral manifestations of dead people or whatnot. The action set pieces have a lot of great eye-catching moments too, especially in the final act where the movie completely lets loose with every over the top idea it can muster, and the end result is something I haven't said about a film in a long time: it's a fun ride.Yes, the movie have some issues I want to point out. The plot itself, while solid as a framework for great entertainment, doesn't have the same depth as the first film. While Leslie Jones' character have a much bigger role here than Ernie Hudson had and is given just as much love as the other Busters she is still somewhat stereotyped at times. There is some rather awkward and cringe-worthy dance scenes here and there, which seem to only exist due to the studio thinking women can't appreciate a film unless it has something stereotypicaly ""girly"" in it or something. Though for the most part, I feel these flaws are easily ignored just because of how much joy this film managed to bring me. As a deeply cynical and jaded person who is tired of the modern times depressing mood, this film came in like a breath of fresh air with it's genuine 80's sensibilities, and is a much needed shot of adrenaline to the dying body of mainstream comedy movies.In the end, all I can say is that it's worth a try. You might be pleasantly surprised if you have the right mindset going in.",Ghostbusters

I felt like I was in a waking coma whilst watching this.,1,28 September 2016,"A terrible remake, with a plot that you would not miss, even if you did notice it.I felt like i was in a waking coma throughout, and even more so when they lead cast started talking about how to tackle the ghosts.The movie would not have lost anything, even if it was a SILENT movie.The lead cast has no bond, and are totally unconvincing as scientists, like they were just reading off a script sheet, with no passion or excitement for the scientific achievements they created. It was more like they found their dads gun, and went out to play with it. The only regular character who has any hope of a career following this is Chris Hemsworth, who shows that he is capable of roles very different from Thor/action style movies.The CGI was bad. For 21st century CGI capabilities in a big-budget movie, this was very below par. The colour saturation for the CGI ghosts was unbearably strong. Billboards everywhere. I hope they managed to recover some of the production cost losses, by all the product placements throughout the film.This was painful from the start, and although i gave it a chance, it was not very long before i thought i would have to staple my eyelids open, just to get to the end.With all the CGI ghosts in a wide-angle shot, it looked as though New York was going to suffer a mega-disaster of biblical proportions, and i was right, but it was not the ghosts that were the cause, it was the movie itself being linked to New York.If there is a God out there, please DO NOT let this have a sequel, even though it was hinted at near the end of the film.",Ghostbusters
690,MrHomerJay,Want strong female lead? Go watch Star Wars Episode 7,2,17 July 2016,"This movie is absolutely terrible. It's like a feature length SNL skit after SNL stopped being funny. Including comedic gems like pussy farts and shooting dudes in the balls.Horror element is completely left out of this installment. Leaving us with stereo types, 1 note characters, and whole movie of jokes bombing.This is a shame, there is real talent involved in this movie. The 4 leads are funny. But unfortunately not in this movie.The unfunny is served with a terrible plot and plot holes. CGI that looks like Spy Kids 3D, stupid 3D gimmick cinematography all lead to completely ruin the suspension of disbelief.Replacing the leads with females opens critics of this move to be called sexist. That can only be the explanation of the favorable reviews of this terrible movie. In fact this movie does disservice to women, by making the female version of GhostBusters terrible.Do not reward their mediocrity just because of the controversy. It's totally manufactured to boost sales.If you want to watch a strong female lead, go ahead and see Star Wars Episode 7. They did the same thing. Retold the story of the original movie replacing Luke with Rey and she is awesome!",Ghostbusters
691,abellha-89730,"Not Great, Not Terrible",6,15 August 2016,"Look, I get it. This movie is no where near as funny or original as it's predecessor. I get why people don't like it. Jokes fell flat on more than one occasion, sometimes the editing and dialogue didn't make sense or flow correctly, and, let's face it, this movie was doomed from the start. Despite its flaws, and they are abundant, I'm not sure it deserves all the hate. Perhaps it is because of my low expectations going into the movie, or maybe I was just in a good mood upon viewing, but I wasn't always disappointed. I actually felt myself laughing a few times, and otherwise I typically chuckled at most of the jokes. I'm not a fan of Melissa McCarthy, but when her primary objective is not to provide constant comic relief, she can be refreshing. Kristen Wiig's character didn't always hold up for me, her motives and backstory often times feeling contrived. However, Wiig's performance was decent. Leslie Jones's character had a habit of slipping into what some would call a stereotype, but overall, she seemed to be unique enough, especially with her somewhat quirky knowledge of the city. And Kate McKinnon. Kate McKinnon saved a lot of this movie for me. She certainly did not get enough dialogue and some of her jokes felt forced, but her overall character, a zany inventor with a sarcastic and bit of a flirty attitude, really livened up some scenes. Sometimes, her mere facial expressions made a joke funny that wouldn't have been so funny otherwise. The movie was also graced with the presence of Chris Hemsworth, portraying a dimwitted yet apparently endearing secretary. He had his funny moments, though his chemistry with the team was lacking. As for the plot, it was simple, with predictable twists and turns, and some interesting parallels. It was different from the original, but not necessarily good, and it can be difficult to tell a difference from time to time. The antagonist felt random, and in hindsight, his motives are kind of unclear. But the effects had their moments of flashy and colorful splendor, especially when it came to the action sequences. However, they did get gimmicky from time to time. Finally, I will try to delicately address the elephant in the room. Originally, I was apprehensive of the movie because of its casting, because I felt it was, perhaps, forcing a statement. I was so convinced it was going to be terrible that I refused to watch the trailer, which, at the time, was completely bombing on YouTube. But then I began reading some of the reviews and, while it's certainly not award- worthy material, people were enjoying it. Because, really, when you don't take it too seriously, it's an enjoyable movie. When you review the decisions of casting and wonder, just consider that there's nothing wrong with having female Ghostbusters. They're not replacing the old ones, they're not even trying. The characters are new, sometimes offering parallels to the originals, yet still holding their own. And, as much as I love the original Ghostbusters, it wasn't a deep film with deep characters or a deep plot that wouldn't be difficult to mirror. Not that this is an excuse by any means, but when you look back on the original, you wonder how much of its reputation is held up by hype. The effects have their moments of originality, but they also have their less-than-realistic green screen moments. Regardless, the first Ghosbusters was original in its mere concept and some could even consider it a staple of cinema. Is its revamp held to the same standard? Yes. Does it meet that standard? No, but maybe that's because its a standard nearly impossible to meet. The original was so good because of it came out at the perfect time. Don't get me wrong, the original is still funnier and better written than its revamp, but when you hold the new Ghostbusters on its own, it's not a terrible movie. It has likable characters, some funny moments, decent performances and good effects. That's why it's just a good movie. Not great, not terrible, but good. So if you go into viewing already hating the movie, you're probably going to hate it leaving the theatre, but if you go into it with an open mind and trying not to really compare every instance to the original, you may find yourself somewhat pleased, or, dare I say, actually enjoying the film. Oh, and by the way, it has some ""eh"" cameos and a sort of cringe- worthy dace sequence that was, thankfully, banished to the end credits, so beware.",Ghostbusters
692,hornbys-60213,Great cast wasted on a terrible script,3,16 March 2020,"The cast are all women of talent, funny and great actors in other work. So, what are they doing in this rubbish. It's humour is juvenile and mostly rests on inverse sexism. It makes a few welcome nods to the original movies but this is the kind of movie that thinks that sexual harassment in the workplace is funny, as long as the victim is a man.",Ghostbusters
693,loki-69333,Franchisebusters,1,13 December 2019,"I think this movie didn't understand the concept of the 84 GB movie. The 86 movie went sort of the same direction as this one. The first gave us a feel for the paranormal and yes, it was silly and yes it was ridiculous but the actors treated it as a ""serious"" movie. I think Paul Feig is really a funny guy, but his strength is more individualized and doesn't translate well to a movie format, in my opinion. TO me, the real problem, and what would have actually justified the film in almost every way... was the main characters. Had they simply made them the daughters of the originals, that would have given me the feels for these new characters. Instead they went with killing off the past and that didn't do anything but make me a sad panda.",Ghostbusters
694,nealoade,Who was this movie made for?,4,3 October 2018,"Great supporting cast, check. SNL alumini in the lead roles as per the originals, check. So what went wrong? Summary: 'The Heat' and 'Spy' meets 'Scooby-Doo'. Something nobody asked for, ever. Fails on all fronts as a 'Ghostbusters' movie. Not-specific-to-plot spoilers ahead.The initial backlash against this movie was ugly and predictable. It recieved furious ire for its all female cast (Bill Murray's idea in a throwaway interview comment). But then came damn near offensive cash-grab trailers, stating '30 years later' as if it was a sequel, not a reboot. You can't really hold Paul Feig responsible, that kind of playing it safe has 'studio intereference' written all over it.The act of totally rebooting Ghostbusters, imho, IS the first issue. If you're starting a franchise new, you best make damn sure you got the chops to back it up. The script of Ghostbusters: ATC does not have the chops. It's Paul Feig-level snappy, sure. The jokes are focussed, well delivered and occasionally quite funny. However there's glaring pacing issues. Our heroes suddenly jump from four newly unemployed nobodies who have an idea, a building, a hearse and some experimental equipment that they've salvaged from their university jobs, to their first ghostbusting job, which they suddenly roll up in a fully customised Ecto-1, equipped with uniforms and FOUR fully developed proton packs. This is like 10 seconds later (actual time, not film time). This, again, could be studio interference, but there are plenty of examples of lazy writing in the movie to make one uncertain.Paul Feig has claimed to care very deeply about this film, but it's obvious that he cares very little for Ghostbusters, even going so far as to throw Bull Murray's cameo character out of window, killing him. In a better film, this could have been a wonderfully tongue-in-cheek moment.In THIS film, where Proton Packs are guns, not conductive wands, the ghosts have a brightly coloured glow about them, a la the Scooby Doo movies and one of the ghosts is an actual, honest to goodness dragon - you've got to wonder about the processes that he took in making a Ghostbusters that fans would actually be able to recognise. Paul Feig didn't bother. Had he bothered, it might have countered the violent reaction that so many 'fans' had, and often have, to the inevitable growth and change in a franchise.Also, there's a matinee in the background of one scene advertising ""Bruce Lee's Fists of Fury"". FISTS of Fury? Seriously?And when you have a comedy actor in their prime like Kate McKinnon on your books, is there any need to dress her in funny goggles and give her a funny voice. Her character was jarring to watch, as was Chris Hemsworth's. Perfect examples of comedy for people who repeatedly post Minion memes on Facebook and eat exclusively chicken dippers because they're 'fussy about food'.Final negative point, the music is just truly disgusting. The remade theme tune, the live band in the film, the score/OST itself, all deserve to be recategorised into a new genre: sub-music. On the plus side, Slimer looks great, Leslie Jones nails the ""everyman"" role, literally EVERYONE from the originals returns in some form or another, Andy Garcia is hilarious as the useless mayor, and some of it, particularly the opening and the third act, IS spooky fun, just not Ghostbusters spooky fun.",Ghostbusters

700,wulfthar,"I thought it was bad, but I was pleasantly surprised...but Chris Hemsworth steals the show to the girls",8,1 August 2016,"As an ex kid of the 80s I grew up watching movies like Ghostbusters, Goonies, Explorers, Back to the future etc... I was also an avid fan of the cartoon series that I considered from some point of view better than the movie itself. When I heard they were remaking it I thought ""God, this is going to suck!"", and when I heard about the all female cast I thought ""It'gonna suck more"". After checking what they were saying on the net I was seriously considering not going to watch, but on Saturday the other choices were even worse, so I gave it a try. The first surprise was that the theatre was almost full, pretty rare in the area I am currently living, and the audience giggled a lot during the projection, which is even rarer in these days when comedies are not funny at all. Going straight to the movie, the premise is simple: it's a remake of the 1984 movie with female cast, the protagonists do not closely match the original team but they have a good chemistry, in particular the two long time friends, while the punk engineer is definitely the funniest character of the movie AFTER the receptionist, Hemsworth, who actually is fantastic and should play more comedic roles...to be malignant we might add he's born to play the part of the dumb beefcake. He might even become a serious competitor for Zac Efron.The original cast plays a series of cammeos that unlike many remakes (remakes) are real characters who speak and do something for the plot, their appearance actually work. The movie is funny in a 80s tongue in the cheek style, so it might appears outdated to a younger audience, the direction recreates in a decent manner the atmosphere of those years with all the science gadgets the Ghostbusters are using. Mention of honour to Ozzy Osbourne who plays Ozzy, Gerry Garcia who plays a godfather like major of NY and his hysterical assistant. In conclusion, valid movie IMO (7.5 rounded to 8), unfortunately it is receiving bad press from Omega males who think the movie is sexist (???) and/or male teenagers in heat who complain the women are not carbon copies of Kim Kardashian or some other plastic looking celebrity. Well, they are supposed to be funny, not attractive.",Ghostbusters
701,dhart-2,Writing lets this movie down,4,12 May 2017,"Watched it tonight after avoiding it for the longest time. I liked the original but I found this version to be just okay. My opinion is that the writing and the jokes were lazy. In the original the characters took the job seriously and they had to work to just capture one ghost. In this one they were slaying ghosts right and left, making a mockery of the storyline. The acting was decent, given the script. But there is no overcoming the poor writing.",Ghostbusters
702,ScimonFi,Waste of time,2,29 October 2021,"For a comedy film that fits into the Ghostbusters mythology as a reboots it's just not that good. The comedy is very ""try hard"" and on the rare occasion when a joke seemingly lands the comedian then pushes the joke further wearing it out or just delivering it poorly. I'm a film where the 4 leads are apparently comedians it's actually Chris Hemsworth that has the best comedic timing and delivery. Beyond this the characters are generally bland and I won't say that I didn't like them I just didn't care about them. I would say the worst performance is Kate McKinnon over doing the weird character and in many cases going to far and just being kooky for the sake of being kooky.The plot itself is a sequence of contrivances and peppered with seemingly meta-goofs and trying to play with the weapons that the team employ to utter boring effect. I don't much remember the last act as it's a cgi fest that tuned me out.It's a very poor film and I really wouldn't recommend this one unless you really desire wasting a couple of hours of your life.",Ghostbusters

I love the original Ghostbusters (and enjoyed its sequel a bit) and while this falls short of the original, it is a very entertaining and fun movie. Easily better than Ghostbusters2.You can tell the writers and Director really loved the original movies and wanted to pay respect to them, use some of the original ideas but with new twists.

It has a slightly misandric tone to it too which feels really out of place. And the in-joke stabs at YouTube commenters make the filmmakers appear childish, small minded and petty. No professional film-making here.On a positive note; the character animation was actually very well done, Slimer in particular. But it's really unfortunate that the (clearly very skilled) animators had to beautifully animate very dumb ideas. Oh well.Kristen Wiig, imo, is the world's funniest living actress.

And only girls in a movie is boring to me. But he wanted to go so we did. And we both didn't like it.Something that I don't see mentioned much in these other reviews bothered both of us - the movie acted like the other two Ghostbusters had NEVER happened. Now I'm assuming that a lot of the people who went to this movie are very familiar with the original two, and a third sequel would make more sense. But to completely erase the first two in favor of a reboot was annoying. There were cameos of three of the original four and a bust of the late Ramos, but they were TOTALLY different characters! I would expect their original Ghostbuster characters to be retired and they show up to advise the new crew or something. And the only heterosexual relationship that remotely happened was Kristin W's lusting after the clueless beefcake male receptionist. And that went nowhere. Just as well because he was an idiot.Ironically, in order to somewhat follow what's happening, you have to know some of what happens in the original movies.

Anyways out of respect to the old cast since they did cameos in the film i went to watch it in the cinema only to regret doing so.
This is Not a funny movie. It has a good amount of stupid jokes but nothing which you'd laugh about.
This is also not an adventure. The entire movie focuses solely on the cast with the ghosts being secondary at best. The result is the exact opposite we had in Ghostbusters and even Ghostbusters 2.
After watching the movie i feel really sorry that Dan Akroyd and Bill Murray took it to social media to promote this shadow of a movie.

707,amoscow74,Put a Smile on my Face,7,19 July 2016,"First things first.I am a big fan of the original movies but have to admit that my reaction to the trailers for this one was very different to many I have read both here and on the Net.Mine was one of excitement at the thought of having another Ghostbusters movie. The trailers looked fun. Sure the jokes were a little hit and miss and the CG a little too cartoonish but there was a nice mix of nostalgia and freshness to put it on the 'to see' list.Walking out of the movie last night, my original concerns remained valid. The CG is a bit Scooby Doo and it tries a bit too hard to get laughs the whole way through but enough of the jokes land and I found myself chuckling along for the majority of the movie.Wiig and Mcarthy are both fantastic in their roles, totally committing in every way and having great fun doing so. The movie noticeably picks up when Leslie Jones comes on the scene.I loved the idea of Mckinnon's character. I could see what she was going for. A mad scientist straight out of Rocky Horror but for some reason, it never comes off completely. For me, Hemsworth was the only real dud. Not his fault. He did everything he was there to do. The script just doesn't do him justice. The cameos from the original cast are all fun but you can't help feeling that it would have made more sense (and perhaps more fun) for them to have taken on their former roles. Having said that it didn't feel as if they were wasted and there was one particular cameo right at the end (during the credits) that had me smiling from ear to ear.The story is on a par with the originals and treads the right line between fun and frightening.Will it be a classic. Probably not. But it is a fantastic origins story. More in the mould of a Marvel flick than Ghostbusters but no less worthwhile for it.The climax is terrific with a Ghostbustin fight, the likes of which has not been seen before in a Ghostbusters movie.At the end of the day, the film more than met my hopes for it.

708,steve_jm_kidd,Most disappointing film I have ever seen?,3,18 July 2016,"Is this the most disappointing film I have ever seen? It is probably not the worst, though it could easily win this year's Golden Raspberry, it is just heartbreaking to see an absolutely classic film from one's youth turned into something so much less. Kirsten Wiig is watchable, Melissa McCarthy delivers the kind of role you fear she will after you have seen one of her trailers and everything else swings from being a waste of time to abhorrent. Notable negatives include the reliance Nitpickers guide to Star Trek Technobabble generator, and the morphing of Jar Jar Binks into two different characters, one the comedic disaster half, the other the happy natives playing banjos in the sun stereotype, both 'halves' actually performing an exponential magnification of the eww factor, making Jillian and Patti at least 4 times more annoying than the clumsy, well-meaning Gungan outcast. The thing is, given the tools at their disposal, the film makers could have made something terrific. Great franchise, sweet concept, New York locations, practically unlimited budget, available talent, how could they even do this? I'm actually angry! They even had Bill Murray, but not as Venkman! He was an old professor, but a different character, identical in demeanor, who seemed shoehorned in for no purpose whatsoever and then defenestrated without having contributed dick to the story. As each minute ticks by my opinion of this film sinks. I left after about an hour, I wish it had never been made.

Melissa McCarthy and Kristen Wiig did this with such lackluster I was ashamed for them. Paul Feig, I would ask how you went from great movies like Bridesmaid and Spy to this drivel? So you had a $165 million dollar budget and they roped you into this. It isn't about sexism. It's about doing a good job and the movie fails. It doesn't have the heart in it. It goes for quick humor and fails. Pratfalls and kind of gross out humor is what is tried to sell when you see this. I recommend you take a pass and teach Paul Feig that he can do better.

The characters had no depth or development to make me care about them and I had no real idea which ones were supposed to be the counterparts to the original characters. The actors also did not seem to have very good chemistry or seem to be enjoying themselves very much, plus the script was all over the place and, as to often happens, the film was practically drowned in CGI to the detriment of the film and characters.I did like some of the nods to the originals, but even with that why not have the original actors play their characters in the first movie rather than cameos as different characters and act like the original movie never existed? - if you are going to have the original actors appear, why not have them be their original characters and be mentors to the new Ghostbusters? So while Ghostbusters '16 was entertaining enough to avoid being a total disaster, it is just a shadow of the original Ghostbusters - it actually reminded me more of the far inferior Ghostbusters 2- and it joins the list of unnecessary 80's remakes that did not need to me made.",Ghostbusters

I managed to drag my daughter and her boyfriend to see it, neither are Melissa McCarthy fans and they happened to like it. To be honest her stuff IS pretty played out. She keeps making one movie after another that are exactly the same so I was worried it would be the case with that one too, but it's not. This is not a M. McCarthy movie. It's an ensemble and they all played their roles really well. I was really impressed that I didn't think about any of their previous work when I was watching this. If this movie did not make money I blame the majority of it on that horrible trailer. Horrible, Horrible, HORRIBLE! They never should have released that, that was a mistake and so was releasing the new theme song early. It's really sad that no one went to see this because everyone's perceptions were completely wrong and unfounded. To review, class, No. 1 -- It's not a Melissa M. movie; No. 2 -- That song is hardly even in the movie and No 3. I actually think it's as funny and as entertaining as the first Ghostbusters. This movie takes nothing away from the original. It's its own movie with some lovely cameos from the guys and Annie Potts (their way of giving it their blessing I think) and the music is AH-MAZING! It's worth watching just for that. If you stay through the credits you'll hear song after song of really awesome original stuff, and some very funny dance moves by Chris Hemsworth.

I like both Wiig and McCarthy and MacKinnon has made me laugh several times on SNL. Hemsworth is also a good actor, as are several of the the supporting cast. The script however is just mind-bogglingly bad. It would have been rejected in a grade school drama class. If you add the fact that Feig's direction seems to consist of telling his cast to improvise, and whether the improvs are funny or not (mostly not) keeping them in the movie you have the recipe for a really bad film.There's really no story, no characters to care about and the parts that are supposed to be funny fall flat. It's a waste of money, talent and a franchise that could have been resurrected and profitable, had it been done right.",Ghostbusters
715,noorutin,Very entertaining; just check your baggage at the door.,8,9 October 2016,"First I need to say that I watched the EXTENDED Blu-ray cut of the film. I can imagine the theatre version being worse off for leaving out stuff, but can't offer a direct comparison. I'll just say that the extended cut was very good and did not feel sluggish at any point.Honestly, there's no way to objectively call this a bad movie. It is funny, well paced and shot, and has excellent tone. My 26-year old self found it a very pleasant surprise; a good time, funny and well acted. And yes, of course I know the original movies, too.Aside from the people who clearly have a problem with women being cast as actual regular human beings in lead roles, it is my firm belief that most of the haters of this movie are Gen-X'ers simply unable to get off their collective high horse. If you try to, for whatever reason, compare this piece to the original movies, then something's already gone wrong with you. There is absolutely no reason to do so. It is not a remake. It is a reboot in its own right, in the year 2016, and does very well for itself. There are a lot of respectful nods towards the earlier movies, all of which I found fitting and in good taste.If you are of the opinion that the original movies are the holy grail of comedy filmmaking, and are unable to check your attitude and preconceptions at the door when watching this movie, then just don't bother. All you'll be doing is looking for reasons not to like this flick, end up miserable and then pollute the opinion pool for those of us who can see a movie for what it is.",Ghostbusters

719,vmmvieira,unnecessary really...,4,23 January 2018,"The problem with remakes, is that they are always compared to the original movies, unless they are so old, that two generations have passed... It's not the case with this version of Ghostbusters, as I can still remember very well the original movie. And this version is indeed very poor. 
I understand the need and interest in the all female cast for a remake and I support it! We need such role models, and it's an acceptable situation to remake and recast.
However, I was expecting the movie to be at least as bit funny as the original (see above) and it was not. Simply the script was not good enough for this cast. by far the best character was Jillian Holtzmann performed by Kate McKinnon. With little speech time, she rocked her character, and I dare to say better than Egon Sprengler originally.. but the other characters we so.... uninteresting and really not that funny... Could have been much better.
The movie gets one star more from me for the multiple cameos of the original cast. 
In short, an unnecessary movie, the resources could have been used better. I don't think my daughter will grow up to admire the female ghostbusters as I did with the original cast. So they failed on both accounts: on the entertainment and on the social aspect.",Ghostbusters

It's so bad that people don't even want to acknowledge it's existence. It is NOT considered Canon. They ruined the wholesome humour that the original movies had through censorship, and they the plot through forced inclusiveness rather than keeping things relevant.

I chuckled a couple of times, but most of the time I was thinking 'what the hell is this?'. I can't believe this came from the same writer that wrote for Freaks and Geeks, and the same director from Bridesmaids. I don't even know who the target audience is, the humour is so juvenile that only a very young child could laugh at it, but it also contains a few swear words, so who is it for exactly? The ghosts are terrible, they look like The Haunted Mansion ghosts, or a Scooby Doo movie. I'm very disappointed in Wiig and McCarthy, I really liked Wiig in everything I've seen her in except this, and I've been a fan of Mike and Molly since the show's start. I'm honestly flabbergasted that this got made. Considering that most sequels are worse than their original counterpart I think that if they made a sequel to this drivel that it could possibly be the new worst movie of all time.",Ghostbusters

I loved the first film and enjoyed the second one too, I found them funny in a smart way; the comedy in this film contributes nothing in the story and is just put there to get a cheap chuckle from the audience, plus, the jokes are incongruous with the situation, nobody would act the way these people do when faced with what they are faced in the movie. This movie is just the original story without the charm, humour and decent effects; this new movie is all tell, no show and doesn't trust it's audience one single bit.

728,David65536,Woefully bad even if you lower your expectations,1,17 July 2016,"After the controversy about the all female cast and the unappealing trailer I lowered my expectations and decided to watch this movie without measuring it against the original Ghostbusters. I didn't pay too much attention to the gender of the characters and their positive or negative attributes. The movie is just not funny. The plot is messy and the exposition is very poor. It is very difficult to root for the protagonists as they are flat and there is no sense of the magnitude of the threat and you have a very unclear sense of what is going on. That forces you to rely on the original as a reference as it had a very clear enemy and a bunch of funny sidekick ghosts. The end is pretty weird and sort of comes out of nowhere.I would not criticize too much the actors as the lines they were given after not very funny to begin with. The action is pretty much missing and scarce for a two hour long movie. And somehow all the time that is spent introducing us the characters and their motivations is lost. It's like they wanted to rely on the charms of Melissa McCarthy and Kristen Wiig, but as charming as they are you have to give them something to work with. The interaction of the Ghostbusters with the government is not very funny either. I'm not going to introduce spoilers here so I'm just going to say that it was not an interesting parody and it tried to rely on jokes that didn't have to much punch.All the scenes that i remember from the trailer, that were pretty alarming, are played in the movie with the results you expected. Not a good thing. I feel sad about the movie because given the nostalgic value of the original and how well it still stands despite the defects it has, I would had really liked for this movie to work, the idea of the reverse gendered Ghostbusters could have been made well and even taking advantage of the female perspective on things. I feel bad for women, they deserved a better movie and you sense that a funnier and smarter movie could have been made with the actresses cast for this remake.From an amateur critic perspective, I think the movie makers forgot the the original Ghostbusters was a parody of many things: government, politicians, horror movies, fringe scientists, and romantic relationships. The movie had a lot of dialog comedy and pure slapstick but it didn't rely on them only. Obviously the 2016 version of Ghostbusters sets the way for a sequel at the end. I just hope they find a different scriptwriter and director to make it.",Ghostbusters

I just feel sad for those who have give to that film that low rating. They fooling themselves and I guess they have issues that need to take care of this issues with some professional help. I believe it is so unfair to see that a great entertaining comedy have 5.4 rating...and a garbage TV series like Luke Cage that saw recently and regretted the lost 13 hours of my life to have 8.4 rating...all this makes me think that actually the rating system in here is for garbage.

730,Doc_ock_4mugen,Try to please everyone fail at pleasing everyone. (spoilers),3,23 July 2016,"I disliked the notion of a Ghostbusters reboot first hand. Even BEFORE Paul Feig was chosen as a director. I disliked that he was chosen, since right out of the bat, he said he was disregarding the original movie and the characters and making it his own thing. (and gender-bending because ""reasons"".)Then began the Gender politics crap.So, the movie. It had ALL the signs of a massive train-wreck, but somehow the movie managed to step up above massive train-wreck. It's watchable, but not good. -Forced Humor. Didn't laugh at all with this ""Comedy"" The closest thing to a laugh were a few chuckles on a few Kevin scenes. It felt like a bad parody than Ghostbusters. -Forced References to the far more better Ghostbusters movie. they kinda derailed the movie. -2D Characters: The Straightwoman, the Fat One, the Obnoxiously loud Black One, the ""quirky"" one. There was no real chemistry between them.-forced ""Feminist Propaganda"" felt out of place. The infamous Patty Scene, the jab at the Youtube comments, Shooting a male ghost in the groin. Men being evil or idiots. (Rewatch the movie and picture the cast as male. It'll be extremely sexist!)In the hands of a much more competent writer and director, (and maybe a better cast by removing Jones and McCarthy) we could have gotten a far more better movie. (That would have still gotten hate because reboot) What we got was a mess trying to serve too many masters (GB fans, ""feminists"", etc.) and not pleasing anyone.

The racial tone was certainly not needed but sadly expected.The acting is okay, the CGI is okay, but the story line is just too politically correct and fails in imagination.In the end, this movie did not need to be made, it lacks in everything.

All of the principals in this one are great in their roles, the special effects have been dialed up to meet early 21sr C. standards, and much CGI ectoplasm is flung about.

No, a woman with half the IQ of Erin would say to Kevin after 30 seconds, ""Look, you're cute, but you're so stupid you're obviously the product of inbreeding. Get out."" And those of you who keep claiming there's no fat jokes? Yes they are! Like the misogyny they're subtle but they ARE there. All those moments with Abby and soup? The bit about the sandwich, her picking off others' food, and low blood sugar? Abby only being able to come up with soup as a good thing in the world? Those are ALL fat jokes. Cause ""Oh, well, she's fat so she should be obsessed with food."" Haha, very funny. Look, I'm fat, I know a fat joke when I hear one. The only saving grace of this movie is Leslie Jones. She deserves so much better. I want to see her in a horror-action flick where she's killing vampires or Lovecraft's Elder Gods. Cause she's amazing and I love her.

738,KahnuevsKrake,I'm a MAN and I LOVED it!,8,14 July 2016,"Seriously, what the hell was all that hate about? I was disgusted by all the sexist backlash this film got before it was even released. But funnily enough it was all that controversy that made me want to see it.Those girls were actually very funny, particularly Melissa McCarthy and Leslie Jones, and I laughed out loud at at more than a few points. Although I have to say that Kate McKinnons character got a bit annoying at times, but that's a minor gripe.Chris Hemsworth's character was also very funny. A lot of hateful reviews seem to claim he was the only funny thing in a ""man-hating movie"", which is quite ironic considering the character is essentially a male version of the dumb blonde secretary stereotype next to the smart, funny, butt-kicking women. Considering he's not a comedian, he did a great job in that role and he was clearly having a great time there.But what do I think of it compared to the original? Both versions are very good films. This remake is a great movie in its own right, but it's almost a shame that it's a Ghostbusters film, because no matter how good it is, it will always be unfavourably compared to the original, not because of that small, but very vocal, sexist minority, but because it's a widely beloved classic and part of many peoples childhoods and they will be naturally very apprehensive about a remake, male or female.I personally would love to see more completely ORIGINAL films with funny, intelligent, butt-kicking women in it, then that would prove those sexists to be completely wrong. Because this film was pretty much guaranteed since day one to make a lot of money and being a remake I would imagine some people perceiving it as riding in on the coattails of an already successful franchise, which probably didn't do it any favours in terms of public perception, regardless of gender.So, verdict: A very funny and enjoyable film in it's own right. Even fans of the classic could enjoy it, so don't try and turn it into a classic vs remake or a male vs female war, because they're both very good films.

740,stephenmonachello,Harold Ramis is rolling in his grave,2,17 July 2016,"Where to start? The new Ghostbusters is easily one of the worst films I have ever viewed. The film starts off on the right foot. It has a creepy setup where we are introduced to our first ghost. The way the film begins you have a false sense of security that the remake may do the original films justice. That false sense of security quickly evaporates when the Ghostbusters meet up with the Dean of Higgins Science Institute. The humor because toilet humor mixed with the really bad humor that we have seen on Saturday Night Live the last decade. With each passing minute from this point, the film becomes more painful and unbearable to watch. If you watched the original trailer for this film, you will remember the same repetitive gag that made the trailer unlikable. I first believed this was the person that cut the trailer, but sadly we see the same repetitive gag with McCarthy and Chinese delivery man, Wiig and Hemsworth, Leslie Jones and every situation she is in, etc. This is a common theme in SNL films. I have seen this with Mike Myers in his films, Adam Sandler with his etc. This becomes tiresome and frustrating for audience members. Can no comedian not just reinventing themselves after a couple years but have more than the same 5 jokes repetitively in the film? What I liked about the film. There is not much, but here it is. I loved Kate McKinnon as Holtzman. She was funny and played her role really well. She had different jokes and situations throughout the film. I also liked the cameos by some of the original cast members. Sadly Ramis passed away and Rick Moranis retired long ago after his wife died. What I hated. There is a lot here. The film was uneven. The film did not have a natural flow. I did not like McCarthy, Wiig, or Jones characters. Jones was the stereo typical African-American, McCarthy once again in a comedy played the same annoying friend that she has played since Brides Maid, and Wiig played the same serious friend or ""straight woman."" Chris Hemsworth, let's make him the dumb eye-candy but for women this time instead of men. If Feminist wants to call those roll sexist, then you have to the same here. You can't pick or chose when to use the term. A spade is a spade. The demon on Leslie Jones shoulders at the heavy metal concert. Since the plot of the film was someone was summoning ghosts to destroy and terrorize the world, why was there a demon involved? The ending's fight sequence left a lot to be desired. They fight their Ghostbusters symbol. It looked like a poor man's Oogie Boogie from The Nightmare Before Christmas. And yes to defeat him, they had to shoot him in the balls. For some reason, when you are a male ghost your one weakness is you can still feel a shot to the balls. Overall this is just not one of the worst remakes I have ever seen, but one of the worst films I have ever seen. No critic wants to be labeled a misogynist so they will be afraid to actually review the film with all the venom so far spewed by Hollywood. This film plain out sucks. I rather have a movie marathon of Ang Lee's The Hulk, The New Fantastic Four (2016), and Steven Seagal's straight to DVD collection then sit through this again. Uwe Boll would have done this film better justice. The film scores a 2 out of 10 which translated into a D- .",Ghostbusters

742,basildonboroughfc-53-110251,Who you gonna call? Not you...,1,22 July 2016,"This does contain a spoiler, but not enough to spoil this film any more than it does on its own.I've spent much of the last few hours trying to think of films I've seen that are as bad as this. I can only think of a few (Mr Nanny, Hellraiser Revelations, Jaws 3D, Gothic). The only two highlights of the film consisted of Dan Ackroyd's brief cameo and that the film eventually ended.Bill Murray's appearance, as paranormal 'debunker' Martin Heiss (too close to Martin Weiss!) was an utter waste of his talents. I hope he was being paid well.This film was always going to be compared to the original, and it doesn't compare at all. The cast are horrendous! I've never seen any of the four main 'actors' before, and never want to see them again. Every one of them made me cringe with their appalling performances.I'd heard a while ago that the film would cast four women as the Ghostbusters, and that would have been a great move if the casting was better.Melissa McCarthy was dreadful throughout. I didn't know her name but am informed that she was the 'awful American' that made 'Spy' unwatchable last year. Kate McKinnon (never heard of her) was difficult to understand at times and cringe-worthy most of the time. Leslie Jones (never heard of her) was annoying every time she opened her mouth. I'm surprised she was happy with this role; it was awful and generally pointless. Kristen Wiig (never head of her) was poor and unsure if her character was intelligent or not, and put in a far too weak performance for a lead role. Possibly the weakest of the four, but not by much.There must have been four better actors that could have been cast than these!Dan Ackroyd suggested these are the best in female comedy. If this is the case then female comedy is extinct, Americans are no judges of what is funny (highly likely) or Dan needs to visit the UK where women make up a large percentage of the best comic talent on TV. US sitcoms might be able to get away with such poor attempts at (child) humour but movies need to be of a far better standard.What Chris Hemsworth was doing by accepting his role I don't know. I'd have expected a lot better from him. Charles Dance appears. What on Earth is he doing in this awful film?! Who played the villain?! Don't know his name and don't want to. Easily forgettable and best kept that way.The script is terrible. There were 3 or 4 scenes of pointless gibberish which could have easily been cut and not impacted on the storyline, for what it is. The attempted humour is very noticeable as being 'American'. The 'humour' consists of saying silly things in silly voices or accents, making stupid noises, dancing around like idiots and a fart. It's pathetic at best.The original theme song, by Ray Parker Jnr, did get a very quick play early in the film. Later on a cover version, which is an assault on anyone's hearing, was played. The original soundtrack was unique and suits the film very well. Its modern equivalent would have only been improved by its total absence.The special effects seemed to be influenced more by Ghostbusters 2 than its predecessor. The early appearance of a ghost was a clear nod to the original, as well as the Marsh Mallow Man's cameo. The affects were good but don't appear to have come far from the early 1990's. Another ghosts appeared to have been of a criminal executed by electric chair. This appeared to be a reference to the Ghostbusters 2 courtroom scene.Any self-respecting Ghostbusters fan will NOT add this awful waste of space to their DVD collection. If I had gone to see the film on my own I'd have walked out well before the end. We need to hope that this film is a complete flop otherwise we'll be assaulted with a sequel.",Ghostbusters

Yes its Ghostbusters, yes there are some interesting visuals but if you're expecting some intelligent humor here, like the 1980 Ghostbusters movie - prepare for disappointment. The first funny joke is a fart joke (female fart joke). Thats right, you heard me. Where there were funny looking and interesting Ghosts in the previous Ghostbusters, this movie we have boring ones which actually kill people. People die in this movie. There is a bodycount here.

I suppose us eighties kids would find this more amusing and fun than the millenniums do, they want everything to be so high budget, a list actors and want it yesterday or they throw a fit. The movie was semi forgettable but it was not bad at all. It made me laugh, the CGI was not terrible but could have been better and the actors were OK. More of a nothing but trouble film. Got terrible reviews but ended up having a cult following.",Ghostbusters

746,jibranahmad,Great and Original in its own right,10,14 October 2016,"From the start the movie had an easy transition into the characters. They didn't have a full background on them, but you wouldn't feel lost connecting to them. Each character had their specific way and attraction. I was quite surprised how much the movie achieved in such a short time. The initial beginning didn't feel too long or short, the detective work and mystery didn't feel boring, as well as time with characters as well as connection with them didn't feel too much or too little.Their catastrophe and battle with the villain was perfect amount, especially for comedy. All in all the movie was great.The downsides to this movie: In my opinion, I think this movie followed similar publicity as the reintroduction of Star Wars. In case of both movies, their inherit very popular titles from previous generation. This already sets a mood and expectation for the audience. Unlike the new Star Wars (total copy and paste from my view), Ghostbusters went a different way from their original series. The original was intended a cross between a family movie and horror movie (which was very inventive). Ghostbusters is mainly targeted, or supposed to target people aged between 15-35 (I imagine this is why their sales expectations did not match up). All summed up, the movie is really good, but don't expect it to be Ghostbusters reborn, this is something very different. I think if we get a sequel, then we can expect something similar to the original series as plot, characters, and mood will all align.",Ghostbusters
747,amercuco,Objective review,8,29 September 2016,"This movie is great! I won't comment on other reviews because there seem to be a war going on and it doesn't have much to do with the actual movie.So, it's good, actually it's excellent. I don't usually like remakes but this is something different. Excellent acting, excellent edgy humor, I especially liked Melissa McCarthy, she was brilliant as usual. I won't compare to the original because it wouldn't do justice to either, the original was filmed in different time but they are both really good movies.So if you want to spend 2 hours relaxing, having fun, laughing definitely go for it. You won't regret it. And word of advice, before starting to watch leave your prejudices and expectations outside :)",Ghostbusters
748,ryanphelantv,Hollywood rip-off of the worst kind,1,5 October 2016,"I got sucked in. Despite the reviews, I got sucked in. Beware.. Hollywood is testing us to see if we will watch any old crap as long as it's wrapped up in a nice bright package.A comedy boasting some of my favorite SNL stars, the man who brought us Bridesmaids, rebooting/remaking one of the best comedies of all time. Heck, even the original cast made cameo's so it can't be as bad as everyone is saying right? No ... it's worse than that.What starts out in a slow, but somewhat promising screenplay, after 10 minutes quickly descends into cliché. Although Leslie Jones, is just funny being Leslie Jones, poor Wiig, McKinnon and McCarthy are given absolutely nothing to work with here by way of comedy. The Hemsworth character is just plain embarrassing. It's a shame to think such a wonderful cast has been let down so terribly by a horrible script and poor direction.I have heard children enjoyed the film, so perhaps anyone under the age of 16 may review this positively. But to me, this is the type of film, turning people away from the cinema and to the small screen.. a big Hollywood studio, thinking we will be dumb enough to pony up the cash to watch whatever trash they serve up... and I got sucked in.",Ghostbusters
749,amylunabelly,Notable for the many belly laughs and the important gender flipping narrative,8,24 July 2016,"The comedy: There were many, many laugh-out-loud moments in this film. I heard males and females of all ages laughing in the theater. There were also jokes that weren't all that funny, but when it was funny, it was REALLY funny. Definitely a good time. The gender flipping: If you're female, or a male who supports gender progressive movies (like my male date for the film who really enjoyed it, too) this film gets high points for images that we rarely see on film that are inspiring and way more accurate as to how women are in real life than Hollywood would have us believe. Namely, women are 1) funny 2) brave 3) intelligent 4) warriors who are 5) supportive of each other. And all without cleavage, perfect hair or pornographic posing. Oh, and it also sends the message that females are attracted to sexy males. Wow. How revolutionary...women lust, too! Who'd have thunk it?I was sitting next to a young white girl of about 12 who laughed and clapped throughout the film. I asked her about the film after the credits rolled. She was smiling and excited and could not stop talking. Here's what she said:""My new favorite film!"" ""I didn't want it to end. I kept saying don't end, don't end, don't end!"" ""I liked the black Ghostbuster--she really stood out and was really funny!"" ""I have a new crush-- the boy in the film!""So, while this film may be ""ruining"" some adult men's childhoods...it seems to be poised to be a highlight for the childhoods of the current generation of girls.",Ghostbusters
750,dwarves-36003,This is what happens when you let the feminists decide.,1,24 October 2016,"I went to the theater to watch this, spent fifteen minutes in the screening room, and just walked right out. Now we know what rock bottom for Hollywood looks like; a hot steaming pile of horse s#!t. I was glad that I could get a refund, but then again, It was a waste of time to begin with. Not only was the plot similar to the original, the main protagonists were totally ignorant to their roles. They all tried to be the comic relief at the same time and were just going through the motions. They didn't even have any real chemistry together. This is why the feminists shouldn't get their way, because then the rest of us suffer through godawful pieces of cinema trash like this. Maybe next time those idiots in Hollywood won't try to remake a a popular 80's film and cast only female leads to play roles that had previously been filled by men. And now we have Lethal Weapon being turned into a TV show on FOX and a MacGuyver reboot on CBS.

I didn't even know there was a MacGuyver reboot, and yet here it is!",Ghostbusters

Yeap, exactly... the first 10 minutes seems OK... but when it goes into the next 10minutes, I'm like OMFG... it's so bitchy and annoying and dumb which reminds me of the bitching annoying sam witwicy from tranformers.For some real ghostbusting, watch the original Ghostbuster 1984 and the 2nd 1989, and which I guess i have watched them over and over again without feeling bored.Just stay away from it, unless you don't mind suffering for 2 hours of bitching annoyance.",Ghostbusters
752,valimorg,Started off well,5,26 December 2016,"So let me start by saying I was one of those who immediately disliked the thought of the Ghostbusters getting rebooted. That I was never originally going to watch this. However last night after finding it on redbox my wife and I decided to give it a chance. Hearing that this film wasn't that great, we were watching with lowest expectations we possibly could.After seeing the whole thing, I don't feel this was really a reboot, but more just a remake of the first two smashed into one film, with a few cameos from the originals that are still alive (and even slimer and the stay pufft marshmallow man).The movie basically started off the same as one of the originals, with a college professor teaching a physics class and someone coming in asking about ghosts and wanting them to come investigate.The first encounter is pretty similar, although this time in a historical site rather than a library or museum. The main villain is supposed to come off as weird and creepy, but does a horrible job at doing this, and doesn't really make for a good villain.While the movie managed to make me laugh a few times, it tries really hard. They have Chris Hemsworth as a dumb blonde secretary (eye candy for the women I suppose) but the scenes with him were dumb and just took away from the movie every time (minus the end since his body gets taken over by the villain}. The jokes between the female cast weren't that great either. The jokes about the egg drop soup, were getting incredibly old throughout the movie as well. Just the same thing over and over.As for the effects, they weren't terrible. The thing that turned me off in regards to the ghosts, was just some of the ones they had. In the beginning it was just human ghosts, but then all the sudden we are seeing ghosts of a dragon, to super giants, which brings me basically to the end of the film.The sequence to the end of the film, was basically that of one of the originals with the ghosts suddenly flying all around the city and them having to climb to the top of the tower to take him out, with the twist of him turning into a giant ghost like the ending to one of the other originals and then getting pushed into a portal to another dimension. Which was dumb in how they even did that.In the end, I think this film could've been better, if they hadn't focused so much on the originals like they did. Before the trailers were released for the movie, the creators of the film even stated this was going to take place in its own universe and they were going to leave the original along, but it didn't really feel like it did.They should've left the originals alone.",Ghostbusters

754,azey13,Judge it on its own merits.,10,24 July 2016,"I'm a huge fan of the original franchise, so when everyone was telling me how terrible this reboot was, I decided not to even bother seeing it. Some of the feedback I was getting had to do with the alleged man-hating, some of it the allegedly offensively stereotypical black female character, some of it the reports that the director, producers, and cast were acting horribly towards people who weren't fans of the movie.Then I got stranded on a Saturday night because of the rain and found myself in the cinemas with a good friend. I am SO glad I was pressured into seeing it. Putting aside my love for the original franchise, I found this movie incredibly enjoyable. Paul Feig has NEVER disappointed me. I'm willing to concede that it may be that his humor is just my kind of humor. (Though I must point out that the cinema was pretty packed and everyone in it was laughing. Maybe not at all the jokes that got me, but enough to convince me that we were having a good time.)Conclusion: if you have nothing better to do, give the movie a shot.

755,buksiea,Destroying my childhood memories,4,27 January 2019,"I did not enjoy this movie!!!!! I am the biggest Ghostbuster the original 1984 fan on the planet. I was crazy about the first 2 original Ghostbusters movies. I have seen them both probably 30 times.The humour in the original 2 Ghostbusters movies was brilliant, fun and original!!! I can honestly, honestly say I didn't laugh once while watching the new Ghostbusters reboot!!!! I give this new Ghostbusters a 4.7 and the original a 8.9 and Ghostbusters 2 a 8.3. Hollywood should have made a Ghostbusters 3 with the original cast in 2000 when they were still good-looking. I am so tired of bad movie reboots!!!!!!!! My motto is make brilliant sequels or 100%original movies. For example I'm dreaming of a good Gemlins 3 . But knowing Hollywood they will properly maker a horrible reboot of Gremlins like most of the times.There should be a law preventing people from making reboots.

756,meadever,Such Potential,6,21 July 2017,"Not gonna lie, the trailer for this got me hyped. Heck, the idea of female Ghostbusters was cool to me, but not like it was to everyone else. In my opinion, there was nothing wrong with the original; the stars were the guys who wrote it, so they had every right to cast who they wanted, including themselves. But that is neither here nor there. I went into this movie hopeful. I am a huge SNL fan, so seeing Kristen Wiig and Kate McKinnon in this had me excited. I also think Melissa McCarthy is pretty darn funny as well. With a roster like that, it had to be good right? Yeah, about that... To start off, I had no reason to dislike this film. I'm not biased either way, I don't have an agenda. But from a purely objective standpoint, this movie was not that great. It has some redeeming qualities, but overall it missed the mark for me. Let's start with the acting. Normally, I like Kristen Wiig. I loved her characters on SNL, and I loved her versatility in movies like ""The Skeleton Twins"". But this movie is a prime example of why her film career has been slowing down. Wiig has a great ability to play diverse characters, regardless how weird, and to OWN them. But it's an ability she has not been using lately. Her characters keep hitting the same note of being cute, awkward girls who can't seem to reach their goals, but can pass the time by making crude jokes. There is very little difference between her character in this film and the one she plays in ""Bridesmaids"". Eventually, doing the same schtick over and over gets old, especially when you KNOW she is capable of more. Sadly, the same goes for Melissa McCarthy. God bless her, her character is more diversified than Wiig's, but it still feels like an archetype we've seen a hundred times by now. It's just not memorable. These characters would work in another film, but not in ""Ghostbusters"". What made the original work was the diversity of the characters, and their individual, fleshed-out quirks. In this version, there aren't any quirks, the characters are just sort of awkward for the sake of being awkward. Luckily, Kate McKinnon comes in to show them how it's done. Without her, the movie would have been a lot worse. McKinnon's character is memorable and enjoyable, with a delightful weirdness that she seems to bask in. She so fully embodies her character that its easy to sit there and wish you could go have a beer with this person just to see what she would do next. She is by far the best part of the movie, adding a splash of color to an otherwise drab cast. Now to the writing. What we get is not really a BAD story, but it feels rushed. It doesn't feel as though there was a lot of effort put into it, aside from making sure that certain markers were hit that are present in other ""Ghostbusters"" films. Sadly the story is less about the final conflict and more about showing how the team comes together and starts doing what they do. But we didn't need that. We got a well-paced origin story with the original, and an examination of the difficulties with the sequel. So much of this movie did not need to be devoted to the working life of the team. You can show those things, of course, but not in such a way that you make the ultimate conflict of the whole movie feel tacked-on. But if I had to guess I would imagine things were paced the way they were to allow for the inevitable improvisation that would occur while filming. Again, rather than setting itself apart as something different, this film just falls into the same trap as a lot of comedies these days, where the script is a loose guideline, and a lot of the humor is simply added as things go along. Sometimes this works, and you get golden moments, but sometimes it's overdone, like destroying a whole mountain hoping to find one nugget of gold. The original was scripted and written well, and while there was surely some ad-libbing, it didn't dominate the script. It would have been so refreshing to see that thought-out considerate humor here, revived, but instead we get more of the lowest common denominator. It may have worked in other successful films, but those weren't the films they were supposed to be paying homage to. On another positive note, I will say that the effects were good. The ghosts were spooky without going full-on horror, and I only wish they would use something similar in a Scooby Doo outing in the future. The spirits we get to see are some of the most memorable parts of the whole thing. I may not remember all the jokes, but I remember the gorgeous/terrifying woman in the library. It was also great to see the original cast come back for cameos. I don't really consider it a stamp of approval for the movie, but I can't deny I got excited seeing Bill Murray and Dan Ackroyd show up. It served as a sort of pick me up as I watched. What it all comes down to for me is what I wrote in the title; there was potential. You can see it as you watch. The actors are talented, even if they don't bring it to bear here, the effects are good, and the story could have worked if they had used more inspiration from the original and given it more structure. It's not the worst thing I've ever seen, but if there's something strange in my neighborhood, these aren't the Ghostbusters I'll be calling.",Ghostbusters

758,pskurrie,Well - bit the bullet and went for a look.....my thoughts.,5,22 July 2016,"I did a lot of reading of these reviews, both good and bad, and finally bit the bullet and watched it last night. Yes, I'm a male. Yes, I loved the first Ghostbusters. No - I'm not concerned about the leads being females. BUT - I'll admit it up front I've not liked any of McCarthy's films, purely as the humour is not my bag.As mentioned a lot - the first 30-40 minutes of the film was really GOOD. I really enjoyed it, it had suspense and the characters did a really good job. But from there it really lost its way.Now - don't get me wrong - the problems below for me are not attempting to knit-pick - but are real holes in the plot/continuity of the film. I've not seen anything this bad in a blockbuster film before.Some really glaring things for me: Editing in the Concert scene. One minute there are three ghostbusters on the stage, next cut the four of them are getting the ghost from four different angles. (lets not mention the music choice) The 'bad' guy - who is he and why is he bad? How did he get all the tech (from reading a book apparently). How did he know about the hotel location and its meaning? Holtzmann - far out what can I say, just an awful character. I understand 'weird' - but that character just did not suit the film. The car. One scene is a normal car - next scene a complete Ghostbuster car. Maybe have a 20-second montage of them upgrading the car? The new guns - don't really care they can kill ghosts (not just catch) - but the same as the Car - show a quick montage. First Ghost catch - they store it - then have nowhere to offload it. Slight under-sight one would have thought! :-) The final scene's. Why would the bad guy transform? He'd just frozen a bucket-load of people - why not do the same to the Ghostbusters? For the easy win! The 'troll feedback' scene - really people reading too much. Was one line in the film and didn't come out as being a glaring thing. Didn't mind it at all to be honest. Male Secretary. Was funny but hated it after a while. We get it - he's dumb! But HOW dumb. Kind of like Dory - OK, we understand you forget things - STOP telling us! The original Ghostbusters did not show the female secretary in a bad light - or any character really. NOTHING REDEEMING ABOUT THE FILM. Watch once, throw away was my final thought. Cameos. Waste of time.One other thing, that may not have been mentioned - MARKETING. No redeeming ghosts, no redeeming characters, no redeeming cars/other items. Nothing new to market. In this day and age of marketing being a real money spinner they really should have spent some more time creating iconic things to sell to the kids!Overall the movie was watchable - but I was surprised about the glaring holes in the film and the serious continuity errors. I will never say 'dont watch' - but you really need to suspend your reality when watching this, for all aspects of the film not just the ghosts.",Ghostbusters

It was brighter colored, faster, the characters quirky but unrealistic and unfortunately since I was sooo biased I judged it way harder than I would of had it been an original flick and not based off of an treasured favorite. Having said that I have a 3 yr old I began introducing to classics last yr. He would get bored whenever I put on Ghostbusters 1 or 2, he couldn't pay attention. My brother in law gave us this one and it totally grabbed his attention. He LOVES it and asks to watch it all the time! My friends kids do too, I see kids on youtube and such loving it. Now I can get him to watch the older ones and he likes em alright but still loves this one. It was lighter and catered to him more.

It was witty, fun, scary, caught me off guard sometimes (I died at the ""scratch the eye"" scene with Hemsworth), and a nice little political note is that the script and outfits were not ""gendered"", could have been for any actor. That's rare for an all-female cast movie.The first half of the movie was great with the second half slowing a bit. Like all recent reboots, the plot was a bit of a mirror of the old movie towards the end. The effects and ghosts were super well done, lots of chills down the spine.

762,joejohn-821-884251,A fun movie that had me laughing.,6,12 April 2017,"Let me just start with a little sidenote: I watch and rate A LOT of movies and I RARELY ever write reviews on IMDb (probably mostly due to my laziness). But I thought I would attempt to put forward a level-headed review for this movie since some of the other reviews here are seemingly so incredibly extreme and polarizing. (Frankly, some of these reviews sound like they are either being written by crazy people or by people who don't really watch many movies.)Let's skip to the end - the Bottom line: If you're a person that hasn't seen the original movies, likes comedy paranormal/sci-fi, and likes the actresses in this film, then you should at least give this movie a shot. (IMO, you would have to be a pretty serious person if this movie doesn't at least make you laugh out loud a couple times.)If you're someone on the opposite end of the spectrum who LOVES the original movies (and perhaps the 80s cartoon series as well), if you DO watch this movie, try going into the movie with an open mind and try to understand what this reboot is trying to do; this movie isn't a piece of fan-service created solely to please the die-hard Ghostbusters fans that grew up in the 80s... this movie is a comedy and a vehicle for reviving the Ghostbusters franchise... updating it so that a whole new generation can enjoy ghostbusting. (And to people who love the Ghostbusters franchise, that last part alone should be a wonderful thing to you.)Is this movie perfect? ABSOLUTELY NOT! Is it even amazing? Not really, but...... at the end of the day, I found this move to be entertaining and funny (mostly due to the infinitely likable and charismatic Kristen Wiig and also because of the great quippy dialogue between all of the main characters)... and, IMO, too many movies these days often can't even deliver on one out of those two premises!",Ghostbusters
763,kaosridder,Ghosts have never been this awkward,3,10 August 2016,I caved in due to my gf wanting to see this. Saw the original in the cinema eons ego and loved it even though scared to bits for a considerable span of years afterwards. I wasn't prepared to be so underwhelmed by this reboot. A promising start faded in to jokes that were embarrassing to watch (cat in the bag dragged out for an embarrassing long time. So did the joke explaining equipment with made-up words. Funny the first time. Not the quassilioneth). It seemed very high-strung as EVERY dialogue had to end in some sort of punch-line. Classic mistake. If everyone is a comedian no-one usually is. It makes every character very flat and sammy. The story was very incoherent in places. All of a sudden the mayor is involved even though only the 4 main-characters have been present at all sightings and not really told anyone? The ghosts themselves are disappointing too and a mixed bag. You get the sense that this movie has a split personality not knowing whether to appeal to adults or children. The overall product is what you get when you merge the original with all the subsequent spin offs like cartoons and such. As such faithful to the overall franchise thus making it an average mess trying to appeal to all. A real shame. The last straw was the dance-scene at the credits. Every movie I've ever seen that had to revert to this kind of happy exit payoff for the audience has been an inferior product. It's very often a telltale of an inferior director when he needs this kind of mechanic. Not recommended and indeed the worst product of the franchise so far.,Ghostbusters

Melissa McCartney was great though.The bad of this movie is the ghosts and the cameos. Quit referencing the first movie it takes everyone out of the movie and makes them want to see a better one and the ghosts looked awful except maybe like 3 of them.I thought the girls had good chemistry and the weapons looked awesome but a lot of the jokes fell flat for me and the villain wasn't good as well.

A couple of things were cheesy but it's a comedy... It's also PG-13 and there wasn't any horny sluts panting to get bred either. The female actors weren't slutty, didn't wear a ton of makeup or tight revealing clothing. Maybe people are used to seeing that? My kid loved it! I had a smile on my face the whole time, I remember this distinctly because I read the crap reviews and was ready to sit through a painful movie just to make my kid happy. The characters were well done, each had their own distinct traits and quirks to love. Also (unlike Star wars) it was a totally different movie with completely different aspects, scenes, locations, etc. I didn't see the ""bad acting"" to me it was a comedy and you need to go into that with a lighter attitude. They aren't trying to win an Oscar here folks. I loved that the former Ghost Busters (even those who were not alive) made an appearance and had acting parts. I give it a 10 out of 10 because it is exactly what I hope to see when I grab a PG-13 flick with my kid. There wasn't some ridiculously young female following some 50 year old actor around...

The movies attempts to follow the ghostbusters story line, meanwhile adding a ""modern"" spin on it (ie. overweight crones whats up with that?). What the viewers want to see is a storyline that follows the old movies or at least the cartoon series without any changes, and additions. Overall, the plot is weak, the characters are not male (ie. Vinkman, Spengler), the 2D cartoon series had better special effects than the movie (and the series had NO special effects, thats how terrible it was). I created an IMDb account JUST to comment on how they butchered ghostbusters for me and I hope that Hollywood is smarter next time as to when they bring such a strong fan based series onto the big screens or they will only infuriate more of the audience.",Ghostbusters
769,orjg2,A COMPLETE DISGRACE TO THE GHOSTBUSTERS CINEMATIC LEGACY,1,26 September 2018,"My Goodness. Where do I begin?I think it is fair to say that political correctness was the kiss of death for this GHOSTBUSTERS remake/reboot. It amazes me, how Hollywood doesn't learn its lesson regarding political correctness. No matter how liberal America (and the rest of the world) has become, moviegoers everywhere are still very conservative when it comes to retaining the image of an iconic character or a group of iconic characters. Would you use an African-American dwarf to play Superman in a new Superman film? I don't think so. I am not a misogynist and I really like movies with strong female leads but when movies are used to boost the liberal agenda of some minorities (feminists, african-americans, latinos, etc.) that's when the magic of movies is lost. If you want to make film crap for some minorities, do it, but please don't use a respectable and well established film franchise like Ghostbusters. Make up your own franchise or franchises and fill them with feminists, African-Americans, Latinos, etc. Is that too much to ask?The aesthetics of a film is also important. While it is true that talented actors and actresses are essential in a blockbuster film, obviously they must be good looking and (in some cases) young, so the film looks nice. You wouldn't cast Robert De Niro as Peter Parker/Spider-Man no matter how talented De Niro is. It doesn't matter if De Niro is an Academy award winning actor because he's simply not good for that role. One of the reasons the James Bond films are appealing is the hot women and it would be really stupid to cast Kristen Wigg or Melissa McCarthy as a Bond girl. If the filmmakers made the decision of using an all-female lead cast, couldn't they at least have chosen young and beautiful women instead of fat old hags? Come on!!Regarding the movie itself I can say it's a boring movie, unlike the first two films it doesn't have interesting characters with charisma and it doesn't bring many new ideas to the Ghostbuster cinematic legacy. Even Dan Aykroyd didn't have good things to say about the way Paul Feig handled this beloved franchise. I guess we won't see another GHOSTBUSTERS movie in a long time and it's pretty obvious now that Paul Feig won't never, ever, be given another big budget franchise. He should stick to his mediocre films for mediocre people.Hollywood: Stop ruining iconic characters and franchises with political correctness. Political correctness is a really stupid concept where people gets something valuable, not because they have earned with talent or skills, but because they belong to a minority that must not be ignored.Enough said!!!",Ghostbusters

773,bclivesinme,Why name it Ghostbusters?,1,2 November 2016,"I give this film 1 bag of ectoplasm and a Bill Murray throwing himself out of a window.Just another remake of the first Ghostbusters with comedy that falls face first into the pavement...Who was the target audience for this film? Because I don't know one person who actually enjoyed this film.If the gender roles were flipped the script would have to be rewritten because of the sexiest remarks throughout the film regarding men.The on going jokes about how ""Dumb and Sexy"" Kevin is, who is played by Chris Hemsworth gives me the notion that the writers were in fact ""OK"" with the idea to view the character as a dumb sex object throughout the film.Did I mention Queef jokes?I think Kate McKinnon is hilarious on SNL but she was absolutely terrible in this movie. With her 20 different accents she reminded me of a drug addict that suffers from multiple personality disorder which made me cringe throughout the movie.The comedy falls flat on its face with ""Awkward"" moments of silence and the upstaging of Kate McKinnon. Along with recurring jokes like Wonton soup and youtube comments which each came up three different times!I was very skeptical about seeing this movie at the theaters so I waited for the DVD release. With the backlash of online disgust over the movie trailers, I had to keep a open mind when it was released on DVD. The added dance sequences were unbearable with a already awful sound track with no real direction of suspense or pacing. The original had great orchestrated music which gave a supernatural feel and suspense.Overall I would say that this film played off of the negative comments and notion that people don't think women are funny and shouldn't star in comedies. Which is just absurd! This movie was so bad they had to make drama up in order to publicize the train wreck that Sony created.Call it something else!",Ghostbusters

I loved 'Ghostbusters' as a kid and that'swhy I wanted to see the new one and it totally did not disappoint me!The movie lasts almost two hours, but with good use.

There are some good cameos and for someone who did see the original in the theater years ago, I think I can say that this one is OK. They did use Kate McKinnon a few times for too long, I agree with that. But you knew that was going to happen. If you take yourself too serious, then don't go.

The group is actually funny and had a great chemistry together. I wasn't expecting to laugh but I actually ended laughing to many scenes. I heard someone say it is a feminist movement and I'm sorry that is total asinine. There is not ONE scene pertaining to the degrading of men or them asking for equality. This is a fun comedy the family will enjoy and you will recognize familiar faces of the original. I suggest you do go see this very underrated and over hated film.,Ghostbusters
777,knight_ca,Not that bad,6,23 July 2016,"I remember waiting in line for hours to watch the original Ghostbusters movie in 1984. The queue snaked down the streets, that music by Ray Parker Jnr played endlessly and the famous logo was plastered all over the cinema. It was almost a phenomenon back then. It comes as no surprise then that it has been targeted by the Hollywood remake machine.This time we have some gender reversals with the Ghostbusters crew all played by women. Melissa McCarthy steals the show but is well supported by her co-stars including Kristen Wiig, both of whom worked together on Bridesmaids in 2011. There's a bit too much of Bridesmaids' Annie in Wiig's performance but that's just a minor niggle. I spent the first 15 minutes trying to work out who was the Venkman, Spengler and Stantz equivalent, which of course they are, but it really doesn't matter. The gender reversal continues with Chris Hemsworth being cast as the hapless receptionist. The mighty Thor as a receptionist? No longer Annie Potts' aggressive and overworked Janine but instead Hemsworth as a moronic character who barely knows how to answer a telephone.The story is similar to the original with a few twists and changes. Gone are ancient destroyer gods and demonic dogs in fridges and instead we have a human bad guy. This makes little difference to the story but perhaps doesn't make the ending quite as satisfying. The story doesn't have the originality of the 1984 version and that is where it suffers, you know what to expect. If you haven't seen the original, this probably isn't an issue. The special effects are updated (obviously) and we have some new gadgets for ghost-busting that are largely pointless but do raise a laugh.This is a movie that really doesn't take itself seriously. It goes straight for comedy from the onset with quirky one-liners and a fun, straight-forward story. Hemsworth pokes fun at his own macho image and there are laughs aplenty. The movie has been panned by critics and it certainly isn't Oscar material but it really isn't that bad. It's a total homage to the original and there are so many cameos, it's like a reunion. If you want a couple of hours of fun with an easy-to-watch movie, or you're a fan of the original, then this is worth a try, it's a fun ride. You could do a lot worse.",Ghostbusters

The four female leads are all just empty shells each with one dominant characteristic - we have the fat one, the quiet nerdy one who tries to fit into a male dominated environment (and fails), the stereotypical black character and the obvious lesbian. The only male actor that has more than five minutes of screen time is Chris Hemsworth, whose character doesn't seem to have two brain cells to rub together, and therefore correctly represents (in the eyes of those sad individuals who stand behind this piece of s**t of a movie)the entire male population. Ironically, he still manages to steal every scene he's in because he's the only person even remotely entertaining.

So if you want to watch Ghostbusters, go there.So the positive, Chris Hemsworth shows his range and plays dumb really well, but to bad the part was dumbed down to where it makes no sense and isn't funny.The best actor in this movie was Zach Woods as the tour guide, that part was the only thing they spend anytime on when writing this and then the thought, its ghostbusters if we make some great effects people will love it (Overall they are better in the 84 version).The broken friendship is so poorly written, it is rarely funny and when it is, it feels forced and uninspired.The cameo's, oh ghost of Harold Ramis, may he rest in piece, but it felt like he turned in his grave laughing so hard that he was not part of so corny a tribute, its a crime to call it a tribute to the 84 crew.Holtzmann over the top tech talks, why are they in the movie? they bring nothing to it and when she has a new invention its almost by magic, hey you guys look what I pulled out the dumpster, this can capture ghosts, lets go shoot at a paper target? what? again story line there is no break from when she is in the scene to the next and then there was new tech and the testing of the devices was just to spend the last dollars on special effects, it doesn't move the story forward and are just awkward.Ecto1 was part of the crew, here its the reason why Leslie Jones is part of the movie, I saw a ghost, now I am part of the team, uh and my uncle has a fleet of 32 year old Hearses he is using, we can borrow one, really? The sound track, oh boy did they make it, so horrible bad they should be sued for spoiling my childhood memories.

It's actually fairly entertaining at times but it suffers from overall poor writing. Before all of you 10/10 star people accuse me of of not liking the movie just because of all the main characters are female, I would like to point out that I find Melissa McCarthy, Kate McKinnon and Kristen Wiig all very funny (I'm not that familiar with Leslie Jones), but they can't just magically make medicore writing great.
There is some funny banter between the four ghostbusters and Chris Hemsworth, (who plays the dumb, good looking receptionist) every now and then, but most of the time the parts that are clearly meant to be funny instead end up being a light chuckle or nothing at all. Especially some of the one-liners just made me cringe and it feels like whoever wrote them just though that as long as the line is delivered by someone who is normally funny it's going to work.While I think that some of the 1 star reviews comes from people who are just upset about the all-female cast, the overall mediocre score is pretty much in line with my own impression of the movie. It's neither a 1 or 10 star in my opinion. It could easily have been maybe a 6 or 7 but the poorly written jokes puts too much of a burden on the cast to carry.",Ghostbusters

This movie is a cringefest, it tries so hard to be funny, and the saddest thing is, seems to believe it is. It is just squirmingly awkward to sit through. The original Ghostbusters relied on deadpan, understated and dry humor. There was amazing chemistry between the cast, who played off each other - Venkman as the skirt-chasing con-artist, Stantz as the anyman, and Spengler as the cold genius. This cast has nothing. Melissa McCarthy shouts a lot. Kristen Wiid is awkward. Kate McKinnon acts like she's high on cocaine. Leslie Jones is the token black stereotype. Of all of them, Jones is the only one who comes close to being likable.It's pretty obvious that this movie suffers from a severe lack of competent directing - Paul Feig was clearly in way over his head, and couldn't prevent this disaster from careening off a cliff.Terribly performances, unfunny writing, zero direction ... all in all an embarrassment of a movie.",Ghostbusters

I usually HATE remakes- from Physco to Halloween to Nightmare on Elm St, remakes usually suck! That being said, I always give them a chance to shine. If you're worried that this remake is going to ruin the original, don't! ... After see this movie, it is not a remake- it's more of a re-visioning or sequel to the originals- it's as much of a remake as Vacation was a sequel/remake, to it's original. Nothing in this movie is from the script of the original, it's it's own story, it's own version, it's own movie... Its original, besides the obvious likeness that 4 people become ""Ghostbusters"", it's all new. The movie even makes fun of itself, by adding little Easter eggs of the original. Comparing Ghostbusters 2016 to the original Ghostbusters as a ""remake"" is like comparing Insidious as the remake to original Poltergeist. Give the movie a chance, I promise you'll laugh.

795,emma-maguire96,A refreshing action-comedy,10,13 July 2016,"For starters, I just thought I'd clarify that I'm not sponsored by Sony. I spent $16.50 to see this film, and I'm not making any of that back by reviewing it positively. Ghostbusters (2016) is an uplifting change to a franchise that has been mediocre at best for the last few years. The original is fine, yes, but this film was a blast.It's wonderful. This isn't a gender thing. It's a movie thing. I maintain that most of these jokes would land fine with an all-male cast.It's witty, charming, and just plain neat.We're in New York. It's 2016. Erin (Kristen Wiig), a scientist, realises that her ghost-hunting book (written by herself and her friend Abby (Melissa Mccarthy)), has been released onto the internet by Abby herself. Afraid that this fantastical book will ruin her reputation, Erin hunts down Abby, and her colleague Jillian (Kate McKinnon) who are paranormal scientists. Instead of stopping the sales of the book, the three women end up hunting ghosts.They are soon joined by Kevin (Chris Hemsworth), and Patty (Leslie Jones), as they work to stop the evil machinations of a guy who wants to bring about the end of the world.I wasn't expecting much, re the terrible trailers, but the casting and characterisation is wonderful. The four female leads (Wiig, Mccarthy, McKinnon and Jones) have an irresistible chemistry that translates well on screen. I'd like to make a special mention for McKinnon's Jillian Holtzmann. She's an absolute scene-stealer, zany and delightful to watch, as well as openly flirting with literally everyone on screen.I genuinely found parts of this film scary. There is a lot of camp and comedy, but there's a couple of bits that are somewhat harrowing. Some of the ghosts are creepy-looking, and although we as an audience know there's no risk to any of the main characters, it's still a bit scary. I like that. The balance of horror and comedy is very palatable. It doesn't stray into territory that is too dark or unforgiving, but horror does help the narrative. The pacing of this film is good, too. It's just under two hours long but the time flew by.There are moments where the continuity seems a bit iffy, and the ghosts aren't uber-realistic looking. They're more resemblant of mid-2000s Scooby Doo-itis, but that's okay! Let's be frank, we're not looking for a Ghostbusters movie to be gritty. It's a comedy- horror, not any sort of Paranormal Activity nonsense.To those of you who aren't going to see this movie because of blind attachment to the original, consider this. This remake isn't going to stop your original film existing. You can continue to own your copy of the original while supporting the new.Ghostbusters is joyous, funny, and likable. I mean, if there was ever an invasion of ghosts I'd trust these women to save us.",Ghostbusters
796,jon-gwynne,Good summer popcorn film,8,18 July 2016,"(No Spoilers)I should start by saying that I saw the original when it came out in the theater and loved it so the remake had a lot to live up to going in.I should also say that I liked other Paul Feig films (""Spy"", ""The Heat"" and ""Bridesmaids"").Finally, the notion of remaking ""Ghostbusters"" with an all-female main cast is bothering a disturbing number of people far more than it ought to.This film is a typical, Hollywood Blockbuster summer ""event film"". Lots of money spent on effects and promotion.Lots of annoying product-placement (note to John Schnatter, if you took the money you spend on advertising and put it into buying better ingredients and paying your employees a decent wage, you'd sell more pizza).That being said, what we get is a good movie - better than most blockbusters and better than many other reboots we've been subjected to recently. Much better than the abominable Star Trek reboot.Fortunately, director Feig keeps his stars (especially McCarthy) from going too crazy. He keeps the CGI from overwhelming the story and even makes sure that there actually is a story.Wiig and McCarty are actually almost subdued compared to other films - though McKinnon manages to steal nearly every scene she's in.Is it ""great art""? Of course not. But, then again, neither was the original. The new one is a worthy successor to the original and does exactly what the original did in its day - entertains and amuses us.Bottom line: don't listen to the sexist weasels who hate this film because of some preconceived notion that this is ""political- correctness run amok"".

797,savage1250,It's not even funny enough to be a D movie.,4,30 July 2016,"Ghostbusters is a movie that should not have been made. It is one of those movies that are so hard and painful to watch because deep down you know it should have been great. This movie is nothing but a cash grab, plain and simple. It's an insult to the previous movies, especially the cameos that were incorporated. Almost all the cameos felt force and added nothing to the film. They were better off making a direct sequel than a reboot. I have no problem with an all- female cast, just write the movie better and have a cast that more fits the roles written. Bits and pieces are enjoyable but not enough to make it a hit. Individual characters are written all in the same vein with nothing to differentiate between one another. A blockbuster no, a one-time watch, way yes, painful one at that. This movie could have been good. Just dial down the dumb comedy, do a better story that gives a more meaningful reason to get together and fight these paranormal elements.

801,david-224-475771,At least as much fun as the original.,9,20 July 2016,"I'm a big Ghostbusters fan. I design props and themed environments for a living and have built proton packs, a large scale Ghostbusters sign, a Slimer hologram and so much more as part of an elaborately themed nightclub special event. BIG FAN. I also LOVE the eerie/spooky aesthetic, like Disney's Haunted Mansion or their Twilight Zone Tower of Terror (which I think both influenced this film). I thought this movie was every bit as fun (and flawed) as the first one. I thought they did a fantastic job of honoring so many details of the original, but reinventing them for a modern audience. With such a nostalgia-laden property as is Ghostbusters (or similarly, The Muppets), it's going to be an almost impossible task to please everyone. I like many of the production design details at least as much, if not more than the original. The settings, character and costume decisions, I think, were spot-on. I LOVE ALL of the casting. LOVE. Given the previous work of some of these actors, I was happily surprised to see more understated performances from everyone. Some of my favorite funny moments were the most subtle ""Ain't no bitches gonna hunt no ghosts"". Oh, and Chris Hemsworth's moments were another welcome surprise. So funny. I LOVE all of the ghost interaction moments. Someone put a lot of thought and research into them. They were all very Ghostbuster's — yet perfectly refreshed. And YES, the 3D for this movie is goofy fun- another very clever 3D idea someone came up with that you'll just have to see in person. Is it a brilliant cinema? No, it's Ghostbusters. Perfect summer movie that I look forward to watching during Halloween seasons to come.",Ghostbusters
802,joephillips93,What is going on here?,1,3 August 2016,"The fact that this movie is controversial shows that Hollywood is still broken and that the movie industry is sexist. Let's be honest, the original Ghostbusters wasn't that great, sure a lot people remember it fondly, but that's just because they grew up with it. I don't get what's going on with this website with the mix of 1/10 and 10/10 reviews, I reckon the 1/10 reviews are coming from the 18-25 male who wanted something like the original, and the 10/10 reviews are coming from 30-55 year old women who are the demographic for Paul Feig's other films. Having said that, I believe this really could have worked...But it really didn't. The cast were awful, the worst part of this. This was a chance to show you can have an all-female lead in a franchise, and they blew it. They are an abomination, sure the jokes and writing were bad, but it just doesn't work. Kristen Wiig and Kate McKinnon were OK, but Leslie Jones plays a typical black stereotype, and Melissa McCarthy is still just playing the fat character and it's beyond tiresome now. There is no chemistry between them and at times it's just awkward. The CGI looks like it's out of one of those spoof movies, there are a few questionable plot holes, and why are men treated like idiots in this? Is this a vehicle just to annoy them? A different cast and a different approach and this could have been huge like Jurassic World was last year. One day, we'll get a good female-lead action/comedy film. Not this, though, not even close.",Ghostbusters
803,woodjwood3,No no no no no!,1,16 May 2017,"Words can not describe how terrible this film is, I would go as far and say that this incarnation of Ghostbusters destroyed my childhood memory of the classic Ghostbusters films.

804,mmserrano4,Almost definitely the worst thing I've ever seen,1,20 July 2016,"All of my least favorite movies, A Clockwork Orange, Furious 7, Mad Max, all had some sort of entertainment value. Be that with some actual entertainment found within the confines of the film or by some friends and I getting ironic humor out of them. I went to see this with a couple of people, expecting it to be bad. We at least hoped we could make some jokes during since the theater was basically empty and we wouldn't be killing anyone's buzz. Paul Feig didn't even give us that.This could've been a good movie and despite my outspoken hatred for it, I really hoped it would be. It wasn't. Somehow it dulled Bill Murray so much when he was thrown out of a window by the only ghost they caught the whole movie, I felt nothing. Which is a first considering I absolutely love Bill Murray and after that scene in Zombieland I thought this would hurt a bit. I was wrong, they killed Bill Murray and his charisma.All of the ghosts look too detached from reality but at the same time look too realistic and out of place in a Ghostbusters movie. This really shouldn't be called Ghostbusters. I think if it just called itself something else and switched up bits of it it would've still been bad, but I don't think it'd be as controversial. They don't even really BUST any ghosts. They just kill them or something with Kate McKinnon's dumb ghost guns which fire proton beams which, as shown in this and the original, should be CATCHING the ghosts and holding them. Not slicing them in pieces.My biggest problem with this movie I would have gone forever without realizing if not for one of Leslie Jones' lines. This was in one of the trailers, Melissa McCarthy was possessed and she starts slapping her and yelling ""GET OUT OF MY FRIEND, GHOST"", but then it hit me, were any of them even friends? I don't recall any actual conversations between them that weren't purely technical and about ghosts. The original had scenes like where Ray and Winston (memorable characters, can't say the same for these) are talking about the end of days, where they just casually eat Chinese food and talk to one another about the business, the Twinkie scene, but this had none of that. And Leslie Jones was definitely not their friend. How was she even a Ghostbuster? She literally just walks in and says ""I wanna be in the club!!"" and later discloses aside from the rest that she ""didn't sign up for this I thought this gon be a book club or somethin"". She came to them for help with a ghost, saw Kristen Wigg almost get decapitated by a train while trying to catch one, and hung out with them for days, weeks, maybe months with apparently so little communication that she had no idea what they even did there.If you want a stupidly long and mediocre 1700 word review, go to this link http://apocalypsepromptly.blogspot.com/",Ghostbusters

I watched this with zero expectation, I didn't expect it to be like the old ghost busters and I found it OK, and I didn't even smoke any weed to watch this movie. The humour (BUGGER OFF US SPELLING I AM RIGHT!) was a bit silly but it had some moments. I feel people expect to watch this and be catapulted back to their childhood, not gonna happen. The old ghost busters used dry humour, this is pretty much pure slapstick/toilet humour, I guess I was in the mood for something silly so I enjoyed it.As I said earlier, it's just OK, like this review, nothing amazing, just average, but at least they tried.",Ghostbusters

Yes, there were some flat jokes and some clichéd jokes but other than that? It was great. I honestly cannot believe all the hate this movie has gotten over the fact that it's a group of women as the main actresses. I guess I don't understand the chest pounding over something as simple as a movie that takes NOTHING away from the original. And let's talk about that for a moment, shall we? We've got Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd & Ernie Hudson as characters in the movie. A movie which, original cast member, Mr. Aykroyd co-wrote. So you HAVE the originals boosting and supporting this film. So the haters need to pack it up and go home. The movie had some of the best comedic timing I've seen in a long time. Everyone's character had a different flavor and brought something different to the screen but allowed the characters to mesh with each other. I loved the designs of the movie and the design of the ghosts was one of my favorite things. If you enjoy comedy, strong characters, and a fun movie? Check this out. Don't be swayed by people with nothing better to do with their lives than to tear a 2 hour film down because they think their childhood is under attack.",Ghostbusters
807,mark-mcphee,What a load of rubbish,1,13 June 2018,"So after avoiding this film when it was first released due to the trailers making it look rubbish, I decided to watch it on Netflix because I was that bored.Opening scene was good, the special effects are obviously a marked improvement from the Ghostbusters 30 years ago and that is about as good as the film gets.First scenes with the main cast were very painful to watch. Everyone got up in arms that all the negative reviews were because the cast is female. At the end of the day if the actors are good I don't care what sex, colour, sexual preference etc. they are. If they can act well that is all that matters. Unfortunately the casting for this film was entirely wrong. Story, or what is referred to as the story, is so disjointed and poorly written that you just wait for the scenes were the cast aren't in it and it is just the special effects. To distract you from the dancing, obvious jokes that you see coming a mile away, and poor quality acting, there is a host of big names in small parts and cameos from the Ghostbusters. This fails and, if I'm honest, made me view the actors as being sell outs.Was ready to turn this off after the first 10 mins but sadly sat through the full length of the film and really wished that I had stopped after 10 mins and watched the kettle boil for the time that I wasted. I can honestly say I didn't laugh once during this film.The Ghosbusters films had decent storylines and were well acted. The setup for the jokes were subtle and well timed. The 'science' used in the films played well into the kit used. This film has none of that.This film should have been advertised as a spoof and done by the SyFy channel.Had the movie execs and writers actually thought this through then they could have had a nice money making stream of films rather than killing it off.
They should have made this film a continuation and had the Ghosbusters reunite and hand the torch to a new cast.",Ghostbusters
808,ladyeuthanasia,Hilarious!,10,15 July 2016,"I had no expectations of this film and it absolutely blew me away. LOVED the new characters, the homages to/goofs on the original, and cameos from the original actors. The FX were far better than the first film, naturally. But most of all, it was just freaking hilarious. I laughed all the way through. Chris Hemsworth as the dopey beefcake receptionist was totally delightful. He clearly had fun with this. I don't want to say any more because I might start giving spoilers. But I'll add this: whiny baby men who can't handle a female remake can suck it.

809,eriksheedlo,"I tried.....seriously, I tried!",1,1 June 2020,"I waited for the hype and nonsense to die down and watched on a free preview weekend to see this and make up my own mind.
Unfortunately, it was just a badly written movie with very low brow humor wih, nothing more than a chuckle, if you were lucky, ripped off script from original Ghostbusters 1984 and characters with 1 dimensions, maybe 1/2.
I had no problems with the gender reversals, but for God sakes, write your own script and don't just copy the original. Don't reboot, just remake and do your own take on the Ghostbusters. The gender reversals also dumbed down the characters. The original secretary was smart and snarky. Hemsworth just played a guy they hired cuz he was so hot, but had an IQ of 10. Why? Cuz its so darned funny!! Yawn....
The only way you watched this movie and came away with a good feeling was if you didn't go to it, you would have had to watch 10 straight hours of Jersey Shore. And I probably wouldn't have minded that!
For all its political and gender blah blah, this is just a bad movie. Paul Fieg really missed the mark on this on. Now I know why the reviews and box office returns were so poor! Get it....Poor!

810,Themoviejunkiex,Sequel wouldve been better than a reboot,5,24 September 2016,"The movie was okay. It was what I expected and feared. The movie clearly a complete reboot with different story lines and characters.The original cast made brief 5 second cameos throughout the film which ruined the movie for me.Everyone wanted the original cast as the main characters or be casted as their original characters with more screen time. It would have been better if the women were like daughters of the original ghostbusters or at least be mentored by the original ghostbusters cast. The movie wasn't so terrible as its own movie despite plot holes like ray guns at the end all of a sudden kill ghost.I thought the graphics were great, not sure why people are bashing the graphics.

With an A+ director and cast, not to mention some terrific cameos, it's the best film of 2016. In fact (and I mean this in all honesty), this is much better than the 1984 original. Everything about this film works. Kate McKinnon can do it all. I was thrilled to see her on the big screen, whether flashing a grin or rocking yellow goggles, not to mention those ghost gadgets!

The story and action comes at the right pace as well, the movie never seemed pushed or dragged on.The only thing I didn't like about this movie was how dumb they made Kevin the secretary, it was too over the top. There are plenty of trolls on here giving this movie bad reviews. I'm glad I went to see it and gave it a chance despite reading the reviews.

The story is well written, and I even say it's better than the original story.

I can see this movie becoming another classic in my library, the kind of movie I won't get bored watching multiple times. The cast are great and likable. The ladies felt realer than real, felt like actual everyday people rather than an overused walking trope (I think I know someone just like Holtz in college haha). Kevin is a superstar too lol I love Chris Hemsworth in it - he's such a puppy. The final fight scene is cool. My favorite part has to be the final fight against the pilgrims ghosts. I especially love the after credit scene, got me hyped up for a sequel! There's a lot of nods to the classic too, makes me smile when I spot any one of the easter eggs.The villain was OK - he's not that interesting to be honest. His 'manifesto' reflects a lot of what entitled 'nice guys' dudebros think, which was quite funny on its own way lol.The ending was a bit anti-climatic though, I wish they got more recognition from the officials (or they just tell the officials to suck it and deal with their own problems) I'd give it 8/10 but I'll put it as 10/10 to balance the bad reviews from people who think the old Ghostbusters are somehow a perfect masterpiece that may not be changed in any way, shape or form.",Ghostbusters

817,Bibleman_Adventures12,I didn't enjoy this movie...am I sexist?,3,15 July 2016,"I'm a casual fan of the original 80's film so I wasn't foaming excess saliva at the mouth for a new movie or anything. But then, I see the trailers; awful CGI, dated pop cultural humor, horny mom jokes, prat falls, and even an ""aw hell naw"" spoken from a sassy black character. I kindly removed my spectacles and said with a sombre tone ""With God as my witness, this is abysmal"".And then I went to see it because I felt like it. Though it wasn't as awful as I thought it would be, it still was quite awful. Bad jokes, too many obvious nods to the original (yes, we've seen the original, what's your point?), annoying characters, video game CGI, mediocre directing, and a lackluster story. I also found Chris Hemsworth as the dorky sidekick to be ungodly irritating, and every joke where someone fawns over him graces me with much disdain. While there were some decent jokes and I found the climax to be genuinely enthralling, I don't think the positives outweigh the negatives. It's a lackluster experience overall, and I don't think it's worth paying green for tickets.But I go online to express my feelings on this movie, and I'm met with shocking criticism. ""You didn't like it because you're sexist"" ""You thought it sucked because you hate women"" ""You'd probably enjoy it if it stared men"" and then I asked myself...is this true? I've been married for three years and we had previously been dating since my freshman year of high school, and she's my best friend in the whole wide world....but now that I hate this movie, should I divorce her? We have a daughter on the way, should we see a medical clinic about that? Should I distance myself from all of my female coworkers? What about my mom? *gasp* What about my grandma? But my wife disliked the movie too for mostly similar reasons, does that mean she's a self- hating misogynist? So many questions, so little time! I've always seen women as my equal, but clearly, the reasons of disapproval must link to the fact that women star in it.Because of my recent enlightenment, I've written a new review: Boobs aren't funny. Boobs are boring. Boobs are for morons. What guy even likes boobs to begin with? I've never met a single guy who enjoys boobs. When's the last time you heard a guy say ""I'd like to see pair of big boobs""? Never, because no guy thinks that way. Don't even get me started on butts, because guys hate those too. The best part about the movie was that MAN Chris Hemsworth, because he didn't have boobs or butts. I don't even see the corny jokes in this movie, nor did I see the poor CGI or obnoxious fan-pandering references to the original, I just saw boobs and occasionally I saw butts. Therefore, I give this movie a -1000/10 star rating. Worst movie ever.For people, big names like Dane Cook, to call me sexist and misogynistic because I dislike a movie that happens to star women is absurd. I suppose if I disliked A Haunted House, it's automatically because I'm a racist? I suppose if it I dislike World Trade Center, it's automatically because I'm a conspiring liberal?

And why calling it Ghostbusters without any reference with the first two movies, it's like they didn't exist. The jokes in this are bad and unfunny, the effects are horrible (it's like in the Haunted Mansion), the actresses are not in their place - shouting and doing ridiculous things which are not funny.

820,bewnhurr,Bland like dry toast.,3,2 August 2016,"What do you get when you take four actors, stick them together and have them all doing their own bit? The answer is a movie that feels more like a skit than a comedy. Combine this fact with marketing campaign that is almost in the lines of Citizen Kane ""The movie no one wants you to see"" but in this case it's ""See the movie or you are a sexist"". Now that we have gotten that whole point out, let's talk about the actual movie. Ghostbusters is a reboot of the entire franchise. The first two movies did not happen and the original cast members that make cameos aren't playing the characters they should. The comedy is a hit or a miss for most of the times. I personally do not find jokes about slime in every orifice and cracks to be that funny, even if it made me smile a little. The main problem with the humor is that it's not in the style of what i think of when i think Ghostbusters, it's more like a poor mans slapstick with cheap jokes about queefing and penises. The skit about the stupid male secretary was also flat. The whole ""My cat"" joke was just horrible, the fish tank joke was just sad. Sadly, the movie is also full of filler scenes that are just here because they do not contribute much to the movie overall. And do not get me started about the nut-shots and other scenes like where they talk about some ghosts virginity. One thing i actually like was the fact that they used the bad CGI as a joke with the whole ""Oh it's so fake"" skit. But was it really necessary to do it two times? Again, this is a part of the movie that feels like ""We're doing it because we need more stuff on film"".Now let's talk about the main bad guy and the ghosts in general, the main bad guy is just a big crybaby that have the power to control human beings, why? Because it's something easy to do. Combine that with the fact that the movie looks down on the audience by having the bad guy explain his plans, like it was convoluted or something like that. This is a movie where you try to sell the idea more than you try to sell the movie, yes it would be great to see more movies with women as the main name in them but this movie would have been just as bad if there was four random dudes who suited up and went to catch ghosts, and why? That is because the thing that made Ghostbusters good was not the plot or the setting, but the characters and how they were together. All in all, Ghostbusters 2016 is not a good movie. It is not the worst movie i have ever seen and it doesn't deserve all the ones that it has gotten, but it sure doesn't deserve all the tens it got either.

I failed, and so did Ghostbusters. The plot is disjoint, the characters are shallow, the acting is unconvincing, the humor is forced, and the effects are mediocre. The movie feels like an SNL parody at best and a cash-grab through exploiting the Ghostbusters name and media controversies at worst. It is an insincere attempt to invigorate a beloved series that can hurt the franchise in the long run.I hoped Chris Hemsworth's Kevin would bring some genuine laughs, but his role was just one big cameo and a mockery of the movie's shortcomings. Paul Feig's Ghostbusters has no novelty, no wit, no excitement, no surprise, no cool factor and no memorable moments. One does not have to look into the stereotyping and sexism to reckon that this is a sub-par movie be it sci-fi, horror or comedy.The only redeeming value is a chance to see the old cast and, surprisingly, Melissa McCarthy and Leslie Jones not going overboard with their performances.",Ghostbusters

So, just like everyone else I thought this 2016 reboot would be TERRIBLE. The marketing for the movie was horrendous, so as you can tell I had ZERO expectations for this film. But I saw it for the first time last week...and I LOVED LOVED LOVED it! I was in shock at how much I loved it. Now I still prefer the original, but this is a great film, and is by far one of the best films I have seen this year so far. I'm absolutely shocked at how this only has a 5.4/10 score on this website. I'm assuming that it has that low of a score because people didn't give the movie a chance and just gave it a bad review. Now, the movie isn't flawless. Some of the jokes are bad, and the story is so-so (especially the stupid fact that Erin lets the ghost loose just because she wants to prove it to Bill Murray), but I did give it a 10/10 just because of how much I absolutely enjoyed and loved it. The cast is fantastic in this film. Leslie Jones as Patty and Chris Hemsworth as Kevin are my favorite performances/characters in the movie. However, Kristen Wiig, Mellissa McCarthy, and Kate McKinnon are great as well! The finale of the movie is tons of fun. The special effects are top notch, and it's just a blast to watch.

The movie was a lousy attempt to be ""politically correct""",2,2 October 2016,"This movie was very boring, and the very few chuckles during comical moments. For most of the movie, pretty much all that is seen are two ladies arguing about little things (2 of the Ghostbusters Melissa McCarthy and Kristin Wiig). This happened on and off until the action sequences during the last 20-minutes of the movie. While the action sequences are okay, I was too bored out of my mind to even remotely appreciate them.While there will be no way to prove it, I believe that the idea for this movie was to cater to the ideals of radical feminists and what they believe to be politically correct. If anything, their first mistake was trying to remake a well-liked classic movie. Their second mistake was to make the four main characters women in order to please radical feminists. Their third mistake was to have a story that was obviously poorly written. The result of this was a flopped movie that caused the film company (Sony) to lose over $70 million.

829,passuear,Awful movie. Almost feels like an SNL skit that won't end.,1,17 December 2016,"This movie is just terrible. I wish they would have taken this movie seriously when making it. Just comes off as borderline parody. You have Leslie Jones, Chris Hemsworth, and Melissa McCarthy that were pretty good. They seemed to do fine and have funny parts. Then you have Kristin Wiig and Kate McKinnon. Kristin Wiig should really stick to serious roles where she has no part in the writing. Maybe then she'd make a good movie.I don't know what Kate McKinnon was doing. Almost like she was purposely trying to ruin the movie. Just doesn't make sense. At one point they're in a haunted house in front of a ghost and she starts eating Pringles. Who's laughing at that? Does her uncle own the production company or something? I don't know how the rest of the actors didn't walk off the set with what she was doing. A complete joke of an actress. I'm sure she'll have a great future in the next 12 movies of the Scary Movie franchise. Whatever it is, I won't be watching.If they didn't want this movie to be taken seriously. That's fine. Just don't put the name Ghostbusters on it. Your just scarring the name of a good franchise just to make a dollar. This is worse than Beverly Hills Cop 3.",Ghostbusters

832,SmartGun,This Bustin Made Me Feel Bad.,2,21 September 2016,"Oh where to start? Let's go back to 1984. A small 7 year old lad is taken into a cinema by his father and is completely blown away by a movie named 'Ghostbusters'. It had everything - Action, suspense, scares (be fair guys, I was only 7), an offbeat love story, great effects, great soundtrack, and lets not forget the hilariously natural comedy aspect, which at the time I probably didn't understand as much as I do now.Fast-forward (quite) a few years later. That same lad is now a fully grown man and by sheer accident stumbles upon the news that Hollywood are being ****'s again and are remaking his favourite ""kids movie"". From the get-go I knew this was a bad idea, unless somehow, someway, they managed to continue the story where it left off from GB2. Well, the film finally gets released and guess what? Its an absolute shambles....what a surprise! All of those flavours that made the original so wonderful have been condensed into, for want of the better word, ectoplasmic goo. It's unfunny (aside from one scene with a certain musician), it's forced, the cast (aside from some scenes with Hemsworth) and the characters are HORRENDOUS, cringe-worthy plot, it has very little in common with the original two aside from the obvious, the effects look cheesy, they've butchered the soundtrack...I could go on and on about how bad of an experience this was but I'd be here all day and night.This is one movie that shouldn't have been touched. Sacred ground to many, including myself. I literally can't understand any of the positive reviews this is getting. Complete and utter trash. Part of me couldn't help but think poor Mr. Ramis must be turning in his grave.Who you gonna call? Probably waste disposal.",Ghostbusters
833,vandermerwe-jaco,No...No no... Bad Hollywood no,1,21 October 2016,"Interesting fact: Dan Aykroyd -Whom we all know and love as one of the original busters-(and I don't mean like: ""hey you buster give me back my apple you just stole 'buster'"" i mean GHOSTBUSTER someone who busts the crap out of GHOSTS).. wait what was i saying. Oh yes Dan Aykroyds father was a scientist of sorts who published a book on the paranormal, and i believe this to be the subsequent inspiration for the original concept. Neat huh.So, as far as the science behind the original movies goes. It's as legit as paranormal science could be i suppose. Was that what made it such a huge success? NOOOO it was just that every aspect of it seemed to click into place and just worked. Now i don't really want to waste any energy mentioning 21st century reboot because it doesn't seem like the writers or directors wasted any energy on it themselves (to be honest i'm sure a lot of people worked very hard to make this..thing) Every aspect seemed forced from the comedy to the acting to the ""plot line"" (i suppose you can call it that if you must). It's forced its weak its bad its everything one can despise. Watch it find out for yourself don't take my word for it. I believe that everyone should find their own special reason to hate this, again i hesitate to call it, ""Film, Picture talky""",Ghostbusters

835,mistaphill-1,Painfully Dull and Unfunny,2,27 July 2016,"Already turned off by the terrible trailers, the casting of Melissa McCarthy, and the feminist rhetoric surrounding this movie, I finally went to an industry screening of it, and it was pretty much what I expected, if not worse. McCarthy, in my opinion, is not the comedic genius the studios seem to make her out to be. With each passing movie, her performances should be garnering more Razzie awards. She is the female Adam Sandler, her movies are terrible, we know they're terrible, but yet people still go to see them. I don't get it. This is a movie that is instantly forgettable. Nothing stands out. Not the characters, not the ""story"", not the sleep inducing dialogue, and certainly not the effects, which 3D couldn't even help. There is little sense of urgency, the pacing is the equivalent of watching paint dry, there is nothing to make me care about the characters at all, and there is not ONE laugh to be found. All during the movie, while the Busters were looking for ghosts, I was looking for a point. Never found it. Chris Hemsworth's character was completely unnecessary, it was only there to drive the feminist point home of how smart these ""girls"" are, and how utterly stupid men are. If the roles were reversed, the outrage would be through the roof. Leslie Jones, as the one sassy black Buster, couldn't look more out of place. She towers over the other ladies by a mile. I also think the studio panicked over the negative press her stereotypical performance in the trailers was getting and trimmed a lot of it out of the movie. None of the characters are memorable, you won't care about what happens to them, you won't be on the edge of your seat.. ever. You'll just be looking at your watch. Avoid this movie.",Ghostbusters
836,conatser_rod,May be better than the original.,8,1 November 2018,"Don't understand the hate on this one, except when so many are claiming an agenda that doesn't exist, it seems it says more about them than the movie. I laughed my tail off, and all the women (especially Kate) did a wonderful job. It's a comedy remake, and if judged solely on that it excels. I've seen ""man hating,"" ""feminist propaganda,"" and similar terms, from small people who didn't give the movie a chance. Just sit back, and watch it, and you'll enjoy it. Murray's dry wit in the original probably gives it the edge, barely, but this is certainly in the same league.",Ghostbusters

Loved that the blue humor of the previous movie was gone. In its place was a refreshing romp, scary, chilling, funny and delightful.

It cannot replace the original, simply because no film can top the original.That aside, it was an okay movie- nothing astounding, but a fun, entertaining 90 minutes.I am a fan of Melissa McCarthy and Kristen Wiig anyway, but now I am a huge fan of Kate McKinnon- for me, she stole the show!Regarding the feminist stigma attached to this project, I am more of an 'Equalitist' than a Feminist, and not that it really matters, but I think a mixed Ghostbusters team would have been more representative of Equality.

It was light, funny, and short enough. It didn't take itself too serious. The actors, IMO, did a very good job as well. They gave our entire audience quite a few chuckles.

Mostly because I could not stand the character Dr. Janosz Poha.This last installment is just a fun film. Simple entertainment and best with a beer in your hand while watching. Yes, this movie is very sexist but I couldn't care less (I am a man). The characters are all stereotypes but I've seen worse.

It's not even the same story.Instead, think of it as a parody similar to Hillywood's Supernatural parodies. Over-the-top acting, its own story, some nice cameos.Consider the cast to begin with: You have to know that, with Melissa McCarthy the character will be ridiculous. Kate McKinnon's character will be annoying and inappropriate. OK, I don't like anything Kate McKinnon does on a good day. Kristen Wiig will be every character she's ever played and Leslie Jones will be outrageous and loud. How can anyone try to take this movie as a serious remake?As a parody, it's fun. It has its moments. Chris Hemsworth as the hot but how-do-you-put-your-pants-on? Dumb guy gets real old.

842,dimskodras,Not even close to the classic 1984 GB.,1,15 July 2016,"When i saw the first trailer i wasn't impressed. When i saw the second trailer i thought it was better than the first one but it was missing something. So , i watched it at the cinema to see if it's good or not.The original Ghostbusters was a balanced mix of comedy and fantasy/action. This one uses fantasy/action as the means to make stupid jokes and spread its misandry all over the place. I'm not against powerful female characters and for the record , i loved Furiosa in the latest Mad Max film. The plot was tight , her character was well-presented and well-developed and the movie wasn't all over the place like the new Ghostbusters movie. Seeing Slimer again after such a long time was delightful but the CGI was bad and in the end , even Slimer failed to impress me at all. If this movie had another title and presented itself as a new franchise it would be OK but you can't use the title of such a great 80s classic and demand the fans to like it only because of their common name. I was also disgusted by the way , some people tried to blame other people as sexists only because they didn't like this mess. Overall , save your money for another movie , e.g. Warcraft. It's a lot better and doesn't insult its male audience in the way this abomination does. I can't believe this has a score of 74% in rotten tomatoes. What the hell?",Ghostbusters

845,rodjohaness,Girls V Ghosts,7,2 August 2016,"Ghostbusters (2016) is a reboot of the classic 80s franchise, this time around taking place in today's world and with a new all-star cast of female comedians as the renewed ghost busting team. A mystery man is using artifacts to enhance paranormal activity across New York City, and it is up to this team of scientists and an NY subway worker to capture and/or destroy these ghosts and bring peace back to the city. Things however start escalating too quickly as the world debates the team's legitimacy as well as the discovery of the evil man's true plans.It's rather sad that the drama before the movie was released was more entertaining that the movie itself, but that doesn't really matter if we are reviewing this movie by its own merits. Ultimately this movie was actually quiet entertaining. I chuckled along the entire thing though mainly thanks to its cartoonesque nature mixed with some risqué jokes here and there. I admit I also spoiled myself a lot of the movie because I was not actually all that interested in seeing it and I still managed to find some enjoyment to it. The actresses were charming enough to be likable and there were some scenes here and there that were legit cool and had me pumped to see what would come next. Also despite the weird marketing mishaps this movie had, this movie has absolutely no feminist propaganda in it whatsoever. There are some self aware jabs at the gender controversy here and there, but ultimately the movie makes sure this is just a ""Ghostbusters 2016"" film and not just a ""female Ghostbusters"". Which to be honest was a big relief for me.Actually what you do notice more in this movie is the excessive product and brand placement, which seems to be the norm in all Sony films. I hate the feeling that a movie is just one big overproduced commercial. They actually have a very visible Pringles can when they encounter their first ghost. PRINGLES. Like... seriously.I had several other issues with this movie. As I said it looks more like a live-action cartoon than anything. There are several things that were rather cringey actually. For starters while I am fine with the Ghostbusters looking like rookies while things were happening around them, because that's exactly what they are when the movie starts, it mainly seems like the actresses were just standing there most of the time and just pretending to react to their surroundings. The acting wasn't very convincing at times when it came to the actual ghostbusting. Also it is strange how they went from having nothing to suddenly having a bunch of weapons all ready for ghostbusting. There was no feeling of progression, they just happened to have a ready arsenal and a modified car out of nowhere. The plot was pretty tame and the main villain had very little argument to do what he was doing. Why was he mad again at everyone?The scientific mumbo jumbo the ladies came up with came off as ridiculous rather than credible, all the characters that were not the 4 main ladies had a very one-sided personality. It was like you are either the really stupid but hot guy, or the really bitchy hypocritical secretary, and so on. Every supporting character was very cartoonish in nature and that just made things much less legit for me. How can we promote female empowerment when all you are doing is making everyone else stupid? Also, the final scene was just a load of non-scene crap that I won't even bother to describe.There's also been a lot of talk about the cameos. I didn't mind the cameos in this movie that much but they definitely seemed rather forced, and it really doesn't mean anything to anyone not familiar with the original movies.Overall Ghostbusters 2016 is a fun popcorn flick that isn't really superior in anything, but with all its flaws it still manages to be moderately fun.",Ghostbusters

The start of the movie had so much potential, really thought it was going to be pretty good. It just went downhill from there, with the comedy being so flat and not clever at all. The story was basically just a rehash, but with different characters. Also don't know why they chose to portray the black character in the stereotypical way they did....oh and, Chris Hemsworth's character was just so bad (what a waste of an actually really funny actor). Got so bored half way through, with the terrible comedy and bad plot, I honestly can't even remember the ending.

Let's be real and honest with ourselves and these times, this is a regular movie like almost all the ones that are coming out on these days: same old jokes, same dialogues, same commercial entertainment, period. So yes, you can comfortably watch it at home like the 99.5% of all movies, but then again: What did you expect?Moreover, this gender or feminist and macho discussions just demonstrate how BLIND most people are about almost anything in present time. How is it possible to write or talk about sexism, ""bashing men"", and so on when 99.5% of the movies nowadays are sexists but all the way around discarding and objectifying women, we're living in a MEN's world, no surprise here why this movie is getting all the whining hate. What about Batman vs Superman or else? I guess it was great for most of these ""critics"" here. Ja! Come on, wake up people!Just get over it and keep watching the action movies with tons of visual effects and 3D, it's ""better than this one"", yeah right!

848,Heef,So sad,3,19 July 2016,"Despite more than adequate performances by the main cast the film is truly difficult to watch, and even more difficult to laugh to. The problem isn't that the Ghostbusters are women, it is the truly awful writing and production. The movie is basically a steady progression of placement adverts, cameos, and homages interspersed with underwritten gags and jokes trying to mask a massive failure to create a plot. In the end, it was impossible for the women to inhabit the characters because they were merely a veneer over a rehashing of a style of comedic acting that is more stale than the Ghostbusters franchise itself. So to Melissa McCarthy, Kate McKinnon, Kristen Wiig, and Leslie Jones: if by some miracle you are reading this, don't take any scat over this movie, it was Dan Ackroyd, Ivan Reitman, Amy Pascal, Katie Dippold, and Paul Feig's fault this movie scat the bed.",Ghostbusters
849,mjmegelsh,"Avoid crying bigot or misogynist, people...It is just a shoddy film.",2,17 July 2016,"This movie has garnered a great deal of criticism as well as a defense from those who argue it is best to wait and see what the movie is before solely judging the quality based off of theatrical trailers. That is a fair statement, let us wait and see. However, this move is poorly acted, adds nothing new to the series, and relies heavily on jokes centered around the ineptitude and idiocy of men. In short, the maligned trailers aptly depicted the film.Kristen Wiig and Melissa McCarthy are very talented and Leslie Jones has gifts as well, but each character was annoying and Kate McKinnon headlined the group. This movie is not funny, it is not creative, and it feels like a SJW's fan fiction on a blog post.I like the original film, but I do not adore it like others and it does not offer any nostalgia. However, it was unique, creative and it had four good actors who had strong chemistry. This film does nothing new, nothing creative, and the reasons behind making this film are quite clear. Even if the film featured four men as the leads I would still say it was a bad movie, the feminist aspect just makes it more unbearable.This is not the worst film of all time, but it is abundantly clear based off of the fact that toys for this movie are already on the clearance rack and movie-goers are tweeting pictures of empty showings, that this film is not good and the public knows it. People who stereotype critics of this film as being sexist or anything derogatory for that matter is wrong.

You don't say that crap in all the other movies that just show women as sex objects. But when you actually have a movie where women are not sexualized and make stupid jokes you complain like freaking babies. Get over your entitled selves. About time we got a movie like this. 4 strong yet wacky women who save the day. This movie is a good movie for a good laugh. It is not for younger kids but teens and adults will get a kick out of it. It is just stupid fun with ghosts. I am glad they kept a similar story to the old but made the few changes they did. I think that it was a good idea and honestly if it was 4 men no one would be complaining about it. If you have an open mind and not a sexist dumb butt you will enjoy this movie. Don't let the haters stop you from seeing this movie. It is definitely worth seeing at least once.,Ghostbusters
852,000000000000000000000000,Development hell combined with propaganda.,2,25 July 2016,"Ghostbusters III spent a quarter century in development hell. Over time the project eventually saw its way into the hands of people who by their own statements make ""feminist propaganda"" (Feig and Dippold, the director and lead writer notably) so that they could exploit the name to get attention for a propaganda piece.This started downwards spiral. People would be turned off by the names and their ultimate goal, which forced the team behind the film to more heavily focus it towards a specific audience (""political correctness""/social justice types). While the various problems in this approach could (and have) been gone on at length (such as the massive racism row around Leslie Jones and her character being ""too black"" and ""not black enough""), basically it was a death sentence for the film.A good example of how this failed is the ending where 4 fat middle aged women go on about how the antagonist of the film shouldn't hurt their boy toy because he is hot and probably has a big dick, then hundreds of soldiers get crushed to death, and then they geld the logo of the original films to ""defeat"" it.Because that is funny, right?

I heard that this movie was geared in a feminist way and hell yeah, It's about time. But it does start to alienate me when literally every man in the movie is portrayed as either; a dick, a creepy loser, or a moron. At one point Chris Hemsworths character literally reaches for a phone shaped decoration in fishtank by repeatedly hitting his hand against the glass like some kind of forcefeild. On the flipside, the female characters are these genius heroines here to save the day and deliver overblown technojargon at every turn with the exception of Leslie Jones' character, who was here to play the token black character who spouts lines like SHIIIEEETTT! or AW HELL NAW!The pacing was terrible, most of the fight scenes are spent standing around delivering awful one liners.There are occasional jokes that made me laugh but that doesn't excuse the other thousand terrible jokes, including a tastefully delivered queef joke that rode in on the coattails of a fart joke.TLDR Vaguely racist, overtly sexist, downright badly written trash. skip it",Ghostbusters
856,duden543,Hemsworth steals the show!,4,11 July 2016,"I went to the cinema with mixed feelings about this movie. I have never been a big Ghostbusters fan, but i really enjoyed the Feig/McCarthy movie Spy, and i hoped that this one would be in the same alley.In some few nuggets of comedy there are moments where you laugh good,but it is a little bit oxymoron that it is Hemsworth that actually provides these moments of comedy gold. Because it is obvious that there is a a political statement in this movies, to the jokes about how stupid men to the end battle where the bad guy gets castrated.This would not bug me so much if the comedy was quality. Unfortunately its not. McKinnon and Jones are good, talentful comedians, but this movie is not right for them. Mainly because they need some more movie-experience to get the timing and body-language that is required by a top-movie, SNL can not provide that before tackling a Blockbuster-production like Ghostbusters. Especially McKinnon suffers here, as she has trouble with finding her own identity in a role that is more than a 5 min sketch on SNL, and her body language is trying to be a Jim Carrey light, without succeeding. In scenes where she is supposed to be in the background, she does strange things that draws the attention from the dialogue of the rest of the crew.McCarthy is comfortable with Feig and they perform much of the same routine as they did in Spy, while Wiig manages to balance her role good enough. However, the big star of this movie is Hemsworth that is the pillar of comedy in this movie. His line and ""dumbwitted"" acting is perfect for the role.Now, the biggest problem is the lack of a good foundament for the franchise. Feig unfortunately does not dare to go his own way, and the story feel forced to appeal to everyone. Some of the dialogue is also cringe-worthy (the power of patty) and made go into fetal position on the cinema-chair.There is no clear picture of what Ghostbusters want to be, and if a sequel comes, i hope Feig dares to make his own vision clearer in the movie.So to end this review, not good, Hemsworth steals the show and makes it worthwhile.",Ghostbusters

I will admit the trailer were not good and it had some of the worst marketing I have ever seen for a film. It also had some of the worst audience response to a film I have seen. I did hold out hope that it could be a fun movie because the cast is great and Paul Feig is a talented director. I will be the first to say I actually really enjoyed this film it is a fun summer comedy that I think if you go into without telling yourself you will hate it you will have a good time with it. The film does have some flaws near the ending but all the chemistry between Wiig, McCarthy, McKinnon, and Jones is great and their were moments I could not stop laughing. I also cant praise enough Chris Hemsworth in this movie shines as the not so smart receptionist for the Ghostbusters. One flaw I did have with the film thought is that a lot of the time it did have moments were it was calling back to the originals. I am fine when movies do that but it became a little bit excessive in this film and some of the cameos just did not work. Yes it did also get a little to big on special effect in the third act in the film which drew it down a little bit for me. Overall thought I had a great time with this movie and it is a good addition to the summer movies that have not been very good so far.

The characters were funny and likable, my favourite being Holtzmann (played by Kate McKinnon.) Seeing the movie as someone with no real knowledge of the original I can't talk about any comparisons between the plots but as it's own movie I think it was interesting and clever and it made me laugh. Overall, it was a great movie, and I LOVED the idea of remaking a classic all male movie with female leads. I hope I see more movies like this.",Ghostbusters
860,theringingguy,Forced feminist abortion of a movie.,1,13 October 2016,"I watched this movie a month or two ago in theaters, and from my analysis I would have to say this reboot really killed the classic Ghostbusters movies. The reason I even went to the movie was because that particular day was a Tuesday-night tickets/popcorn/drink special for 5 dollars. The first thing I noticed about the movie in particular was that all the crew members were replaced by women, a sharp contrast from the original Ghostbusters cast. The second thing I noticed is that men are portrayed as evil or really stupid like the idiot they hire as their office assistant. The director Paul Feig's wife must really have him by the balls in their marriage, because this film overly pushes feminism so badly it was cringey to even sit in the theater and watch it. Now, moving on to the actual ""comedy"" of the movie, it was all terrible and rarely any of it was laughable. The characters felt cheesy and for some reason (I'm not in particular a film snob) poorly written. I've seen Melissa McCarthy has been in a few funny movies, but this was not on the list. Most of the other actors I have never seen or heard of except perhaps of course the cameos of actors Bill Murray and Dan Aykroyd(which were honestly the only things I genuinely laughed at in the whole film). And I thought the Black subway lady was the ""Oh lordy Jesus it's a fire"" lady. The only good thing that I really good thing I really have to say about this movie is that I didn't finish the last minute because the power cut out in the movie theater so I was spared the last one-liner and got a refund as well. I just feel if your gonna take such a popular franchise and make a reboot of it, actually make it watchable instead of using it to try and cash out and push an agenda. 1/10 stars. This reboot was awful.- Theringingguy",Ghostbusters
861,joshcolonberrios,A great fun ride.,9,18 July 2016,"This movie from the star it establishes its going to be a fun ride, Erin Gilbert (Kristen Wiig) its a physics professor who reunites with long life friend Abby Yates to inspect a manor which there are ghost and discover that they truly exist. The chemistry between this actresses is awesome, for me Jillian Holtzmann (Katte McKinnon) was the best of all of her. Kevin (Chris Hennsworth) was OK but not memorable like the secretary in the first film. the villain was weak and the rest of the cast OK. Its fun and funny but it doesn't have the the story doesn't have the depth the the first two haves. The cameos are bothersome sometimes and theirs a lot. Its a fun ride for the whole family and believe me you are going to laugh, in honesty its the thing it outranked the original.",Ghostbusters
862,senlarsen,This is not the remake you're looking for,4,18 July 2016,"The worst thing about this film is that anyone who doesn't like it is sexist. Yeah, right! Honestly, this was the best movie to do in 2016? It should have stayed buried. I certainly wouldn't recommend this for young children, and, the sexist attitude in this movie is both heavy handed and juvenile, despite some very funny gags. If the gender roles were reversed, there would be headlines in most western newspapers with scathing attacks on the writers and directors. The show rings more of a comedy sketch than a coherent story. None of the characters are memorable, which is disappointing as I'm a fan of Kristen Wiig's work. There is a cameo from Bill Murray, but it's not particularly funny. Save your time on this one. There are some very funny gags, but they are overshadowed by heavy sexism and lack of a decent story. It doesn't even deserve a 4, but it took a risk and bits are funny. Bring on the girls version of oceans 11 instead. That's a reboot worth talking about and hopefully, praiseworthy.",Ghostbusters

All of the actors were hilarious! Kristen Wiig, Melissa McCarthy, Kate McKinnon, and Leslie Jones all cracked us up,as did Chris Hemsworth. Feig's reboot was very enjoyable and Dan Aykroyd is even an executive producer for the film.It's such a shame that a small group of ignorant, sexist trolls who can't handle the idea of smart, funny women taking on the starring roles in this reboot are trying to tear it down with a 4.6 rating. I'm proud that my 10 year old nephew is able to recognize the movie for what it is: a fun-filled summer blockbuster and that women (like his loving Aunties and Grandmother who took him to see it) are smart, funny, complex beings who can take on any role they want.

864,teasippingnerdymom,Ghostbusters Gets Girl Empowered (and not man-hating either),8,6 August 2016,"Was this a man-hating cartoonish reboot? No. In the 80s, no one seemed  to have a problem with Peter Venkmann creepily stalking of Dana. Let's  consider how Dana was treated in the original film. She asks for help  when she discovers a hell beast in her fridge. Venkmann comes over to  examine everything in her apartment except the fridge but including her  bedroom. He stands too close. He doesn't listen. He makes inappropriate  comments. He just wants to get in her pants. Eventually, she shoves him  out but later accepts his offer to go on a date. Huh? Later, a demon  possesses Dana's body, makes her proposition her body and make out with  one guy and subsequently causes her to have sex with a neighbor guy she  dislikes - yet this is a ""joke"" for the movie. I didn't know sexual  assault by any means (in this case, by the supernatural) was a joke.   Don't get me wrong, I grew up on the Ghostbusters movie and cartoon. I  remember quoting Bill Murray often (""...dogs and cats living  together... mass hysteria!""), and I don't think that movie would have  been as successful without Bill Murray's oft ad-libbed lines.   But let's be fair when we compare these movies, shall we? If this is  considered man-hating, the original should be considered woman-hating.  The original had an all-male team with a female villain who was wearing  a bubbly outfit and high heels. Interesting. Kind of like this film as  an all-female team and a male villain? Not sure how that's man-hating.  More like completely turning the tables. Also of note, have the 50  different Spiderman reboots ruined the franchise? No. Batman reboots?  No. So this should not be considered a franchise killer either.  I was thoroughly entertained by this movie. It was funny, it was well  cast, it had special effects that worked with the technology used, and  it had some kick butt moments. But one of my favorite aspects was the  fact that a group of four women were the main characters in an action  film.  Growing up, I saw groupings/teams of men who saved the day with maybe a  ""girl"" or two as a sidekick: the A-Team, the original Ghostbusters,  Back to the Future, Star Trek (original and somewhat TNG), Battlestar  Galactica, Indiana Jones, Knight Rider, He-Man, X-Men, Smurfs, GI  Joe... *sigh* Very few movies, TV shows, or cartoons had more than one  female (or any) helping to overcome the odds. Typically females were  blonde bombshells who screamed and needed to be rescued (i.e., the  super annoying Vicky Vale in Batman).  These women are not always pretty, and they do not mind getting messy.  They dress in jumpsuits and casual clothes. They're intelligent. They  dive headlong into their work and are not waylaid by danger (or threats  from the mayor). And check out the movie posters! Is anyone turned  around showing off their butt or zipping down their suits? NO! Because  women are more than just the display of their parts! Sorry, that got a  little crude there I'm just really excited about women as scientists.  Talk about new ground being broken!   I felt like I could relate to the different characters, more than just  one, and I could see my friends as other characters. I mean, those  thoughts alone were like revelations. Look at that: me and my girls  could bust some ghosts instead of be a romantic interest in some other  hero's action movie (though if it's Captain America doing the asking -  call me!).   There were many excellent scenes that built up the characters and their  relationships. And the scene where the team interviews Kevin (Chris  Hemsworth) is fantastic. Everything with Wiig trying to flirt with  Hemsworth cracked me up (because that would so be me - all awkward and  geeky). Yet there was no need for a romantic subplot in this movie.  Those scenes were just fun. The story focused on the team working  together to uncover who was bringing ghosts into the city and why.  While the main villain is not terribly scary, this movie doesn't  pretend he is either. The villain is unveiled very early on. Is his  motivation earth-shattering or full of depth and backstory? No, but  neither is the movie. It's a good balance of serious and funny moments.  Plus, the women kick ass at the end. I loved the proton whips that came  out, the musical score rising in awesomeness, and ghosts being sent  back to their maker. I enjoyed how the proton packs were used a little  differently not only to catch but also to throw ghosts out of the way.  I liked the team using skills with their physical weapons along with  their intelligence to defeat the main villain. There are great dynamics  and humor between the four women, and the relationship building adds to  the appeal of the film.  This movie re-invents a franchise and has a good time doing so. I felt  it was done well. I'm waving my nerd flag high! Rock on, Ghostbusters.  I hope to see you again. It's not going to be hard to surpass  Ghostbusters II! Because women can be comedy and action stars too.",Ghostbusters

Also some of the jokes made me smile.The bad things nowIt acts as if the first 2 movies never existed, even though in the trailer it said ""30 years ago 4 scientists saved New York"". Instead of making the original ghostbusters teach or introduce us to the new team, the original cast made cameos but they were not their characters from the original movies. That is stupid.Also the original movies were made like 30 years ago and the CGI ghosts looked amazing. In this movie look so stupid, they have like some kind of fog around them, and it looks horrible. It is not the worst CGI there is but still.Except the few smiles I got from this movie, I was dying for it to end so I can review how bad it is. The first hour was so boring I felt like it should end in a minute.Also that they called it ""Ghostbusters"" without having anything to do with the original cast is really ******. As I said, it was even stated in the trailer that 30 years ago New York city was saved by 4 scientists, and this movie treats them like the first movies don't exist. One of the characters even said that they could be the first to uncover or like expose the existence of ghosts.

The whole movie literally only has three genuinely funny characters: the tour guide at the very beginning, who only has very few scenes, Kate McKinnon's Jillian Holtzmann, who is a fantastically unhinged mad scientist type of character, and Chris Hemsworth's Kevin. Unfortunately, neither of them gets enough screen time to make the movie actually enjoyable.It doesn't help that the movie has a lot of other flaws, from Paul Feig's apparent inability to direct good action scenes, the sloppy camera-work and editing (I haven't seen a multi-million dollar blockbuster with so many visible camera and audio equipment in a long time), the bland villain, to the really shoehorned in cameos by the cast of the original Ghostbusters (1984).

This movie contains zero elements of why the first two movies were so successful. The dark creepy ghosts are now replaced with ultra bright neon coloured ghosts (obviously made that way to not scare the kiddies). The entire atmosphere and creepyness of the original is lost and instead is replaced with a cold, sterile atmosphere like going into a hospital.

So, on the bright side, it is better than the trailer made it out to be. In fact, most of the stuff in the trailer were my least favorite parts about the movie, such as when the black ghostbuster girl falls in the crowd and makes a racial joke.I am not the kind of person that cares a lot about special effects or any of that stuff. I like movies for the story and the characters. So having said that, where does that leave this movie? Well, I liked most of the characters. In many ways they mimic the 4 personalities present in the original ghostbusters movie. But the one character that just absolutely ruined it for me was ""Kevin."" The best way i can describe him is that he is the ""Jar Jar Binks"" of this movie. He is so absolutely stupid that it makes the character unbelievable. He would need an IQ of about 10 to say some of the things he says, in which case he would not be able to use a computer, or a car, motorcycle, etc. It's one thing to make a character stupid, but this just goes too far. Even if it were a blonde girl with the blonde jokes, it still went too far. Because nobody is that stupid. I hated every scene that he was in.Other than that, I liked the plot of the movie and the character development from the beginning to the end. In fact, I think the plot was more interesting than Ghostbusters II with the painting that came to life.

Not everyone can improvise as well as Bill Murray.

888,GoDzReaper93,My 100 Honest Review of Ghostbusters (2016) (SPOILERS),6,14 July 2016,"Alright guys, I've just got back from a screening of the new Ghostbusters film. It released here in Australia today and has been the subject of some pretty hefty controversy! We all know about the hate that this film received right of the gate, going as far as the trailer being one of the most disliked videos on Youtube. Granted, we didn't need a remake of one of the most beloved films of all time. Nobody asked for a remake but we've got one. Let me just say right out of the gate: I could not care about the ""stunt casting"" that many people have condemned about this film. Women or Men, the casting does not make a difference to me as I believe that gender does not necessarily have a specific role in film (unless the script calls for it). Additionally, I'm going to say that I was not a hater on the internet who had damned the film before it came out - I did, however, go in with low expectations because of the poor marketing of the film. Finally, I will not be comparing any of this film to the original in terms of quality, as we know that that's a losing battle! Now that that's over, onto the review! Paul Feig is quite a decent director. Having directed more than a few episodes of one of my favourite T.V. shows (The U.S. Office), Bridesmaids which was a massive success, the less successful but still perfectly watchable The Heat and last years brilliant Spy, I was completely interesting in seeing Feig's take before going into this film. Let me just say, this has Feig's fingerprints all over it. If you're not a fan of Feig's style or comedy - BACK AWAY! Feig directs quickly and inserts some quite brilliant moments of humour into the film which comes very quickly and sharply. Unfortunately, most of the gags don't land and there is quite a bit of slapstick - which, to me, is the most laziest form of humour. For example, there is a scene where Holtzman (played by Kate McKinnon - easily the best new character of the bunch) is equipping the team with new weapons and Melissa McCarthy's Abby can't control the beam of the new Ecto-pack, which basically results in her being tossed around like a kid with a firehose for a good minute or two. To me, jokes like these aren't funny, are not intelligent and just feel straight out lazy. Let me touch on the cast really quickly. McCarthy is passable but she doesn't really bring anything new to the table. Kristen Wiig as Erin Gilbert is okay too and I have no bribes with her performance. She is the main character in this film and is our ""in"" into the film. Leslie Jones as Patty was, again, okay. I was initially concerned from the trailers that she's just going to be screaming the whole film and devolving into a stereotypical performance, but she was better than expected. Again, the standout of the new cast has to be Kate Mckinnon as Holtzman. Mckinnon brings a craziness to her character and is the ""dark horse"" of the new team. She has a certain energy that the others don't have and I'd love to see more of her! Chris Hemsworth as Kevin is another standout of the film. As seen from the trailers, he plays the idiotic receptionist and Hemsworth absolutely nails the performance, keeping his casual Australian accent. My favourite moment is when Wiig asks him not to listen to a conversation and Hemsworth responds with ""I won't"" covering his eyes. The villain, played by Neil Casey, is a bit of a misfire. He's just another lonely individual who has been bullied his whole life and ignored, wanting to get revenge - like Electro from The Amazing Spiderman 2 *shudder*. The cameos were brilliant! I expected the main Ghostbusters to make an appearance (R.I.P. Harold!) but I most certainly was not expecting Sigourney Weaver (stay during the credits) and Janine! Unfortunately there is not Rick Moranis though! The plot of the film is pretty basic and follows the basic structure of the original film. The ladies bust a ghost and are not belived by anyone in the city until more ghost run rampant after a maniac sets them loose. There's also moments where they're looking for a residence (which includes a moment with a certain Firehouse) and where they Mayor attempts to shut them down. These are familiar elements which are brought back here and they mostly work well as they did the first time around. The climax of the film is certainly fun and very CG heavy (as you'd expect from a $140m movie called Ghostbusters). Altogether, I was quite surprised with this remake! No it is not as good as the original by any stretch. But, is it fun? Yes. Is it entertaining? Yes. To me, that's all you need from a film like this! I give it a good 7/10",Ghostbusters

The 1st act is genuinely laugh out loud funny and jump out your seat scary. The 2nd act gets a little lost but keeps you on the plot with a few laughs and more scares. The 3rd act seems to fly by, and although not as funny or scary it is satisfying. The girls turn in great comedy performances as does Hemsworth. It does stumble where it tries to nod to the original and should of kept along it's own unique path. Although as an origin story, it was always going to be difficult not to tread on the original's toes. But if it wasn't in New York with Armageddon beckoning there'd of been uproar.

890,exup,"Despite being entertained, I hoped for so much more.",5,29 January 2017,"Being a fan of the original I was both excited and nervous about seeing this film. The concept of the film was kept very close to the original with only minor differences which neither improved nor hindered the movie. The big question was always going to be the cast. The original cast shared a chemistry not often experienced in modern cinema so the decision to replace them with female leads was a clever move. Let's face it would be hard to redo the original actors dynamics so a reinvention was the sensible way to re-ignite this franchise generating less of an un-achievable comparison. The female leads do an excellent job. replicating a similar (but not as strong) bond. Unfortunately the writers fall short on substance, leaving the lead characters with substandard material to work with. it fails to capture the magic, comedy and charm of the original. all of which would have totally been achievable by all the females actors given a better material to work with. This wasn't a terrible movie by any standards. Just a little frustrating as with such a simple story Arc and talented Female cast it's hard to understand why this film just doesn't fully hit a high gear. it constantly leaves you wishing it was more, because you know it could have been. This movie is still able to entertain and the younger generation who would be unfamiliar with the original will no doubt love it. For me it just eliminates any excitement of a sequel.",Ghostbusters
891,tarasensei,Filled with 1980s Corniness that will remind you of the first two,10,23 September 2016,"Fantastic movie that reminds me of the first two Ghostbusters movies. As I watched the movie, I did a lot of comparing. I had to keep reminding myself of how corny the first 2 were/are because this movie is corny. If follows a similar formula as all sequels do of the Ghostbusters getting started and of course the mayor of NY City is involved. It is as funny, ridiculous and silly as the originals, but also a little bit scary.....I jumped a couple of times. People were laughing out loud when I watched this in the theater. There are also great cameos from the actors in the originals as well as SNL actors. The plot is really strong. Compared to the others, the audience knows more about the characters (good and bad characters) than in the older films. There is also a lot more action. The Ghostbusters really kick some ectoplasmic butt. They have a lot of fun gadgets to play with. There's been a lot of negativity regarding this movie because it's an all female cast and there's a ""not so bright"" man in the story. I think if it were an all male cast with a ""dumb"" woman - there'd be no complaints.**I put this as containing a spoiler on the off chance that saying there are cameos or that it follows the same formula as the originals counted as spoilers. :-)",Ghostbusters

893,carmelahayslett,I really liked this film!,9,22 October 2016,"I was skeptical when I first heard about this film. The original Ghostbusters is one of my favorite films and I even had the pleasure of working with Ernie Hudson on a film a few years ago. Still, the videos I saw of this film prior to it's release made me curious enough to go see it. I particularly liked that Kate McKinnon's character (Holtzman) slightly resembled the cartoon-version of Egon Spangler.The laughs are there though the comedy might not be everyone's cup of tea. I thought all four of the leading ladies were wonderfully cast and did great at being four separate personalities that make one great team. I was never a Melissa McCarthy fan but I thought her performance was just wonderful and fun to watch.I also enjoyed every single nod they made to the original film. I liked that the film was about four weird/geeky women who were absolutely not sexualized characters. That's a breath of fresh air! If people want to throw the term ""sexist"" around than this film isn't anymore sexist towards men then the original was towards women.I feel like I gained another Ghostbusters movie! I don't feel like people should take it seriously. You weren't supposed to take the original seriously either! It's a movie that you can sit down, eat some popcorn to, and just have fun watching!",Ghostbusters
894,ijvincent,"Not perfect, but not awful",7,11 August 2016,"SPOILERS FOR A FEW PUNCHLINESKate McKinnon and Leslie Jones are worth the price of admission. McKinnon's Jillian Holtzmann has the confidence (the brazen flirtation with Erin) and smart-mouthed one-liners (""Jillian Holtzmann, Radio Times"") of Peter Venkman and is as comfortable with the Aykroyd-ian techno-jargon as Ramis and even Aykroyd himself. People who have only seen the trailers believe that Jones plays a one-note black stereotype. True, she says ""Oh, hell no!"" at one point, but that's only at one point. In the rest of her screen time, she has knowledge of New York City minutiae that the other characters don't: ""That's where that ghost came from. That location has a lot of bad history surrounding it.""Jones and McKinnon are also the only two leads whose performances felt grounded in reality. Venkman, et al were believable as real people with real quirks, while Erin, Abby, and many supporting characters (the tour guide in the opening scene and the dean of the institute in particular) come across as characters in an ""SNL"" sketch, saying things real people wouldn't say unless they were trying to get a laugh.This brings up another point: many of the jokes were funny (the cab driver inexplicably knowing exactly what kind of ghosts are surrounding his cab), but had unfunny tags attached (""I ain't afraid of no ghosts""). Further, and as in many of Feig's recent productions, the jokes often went on too long (""He soiled himself"").But then there's the awesome climactic fight scene in Times Square. More than just standing still and shooting lasers, the Ghostbusters kick butt and wipe the floor with their adversaries, Holtzmann especially.Most importantly, though, is how iconoclastic the film is. It shows the strength of friendships between women, doesn't sexualize any of the female characters, and doesn't try to define any of them by the romantic relationship they're in. In comparison, Dana Barrett was defined by being a love interest to Venkman, and ""needed"" to have a sheer dress draped sexily over her at the end while Louis was only slightly ravaged. In the meantime, the one male lead of this film was a pretty-boy moron clearly there for his looks. Sounds a lot like the token women in '80s films.Final thoughts: I enjoyed the movie. The original ""Ghostbusters"" is not some holy text. Balloon ghosts? Like ghosts of balloons?",Ghostbusters

What I will say is the movie wasn't good the comedy is terribly forced the parts where it was obvious they intended to be funny just wasn't. The only scene that even made me smile was the possession scene with the little nod the ""The Exorcist"" but even it was forced. Though all of these actresses are funny on their own something just didn't seem to mesh except for ""Holtzmann' played by Kate McKinnon she was the only character I felt was truly funny. The use of Chris Hemsworth what little their was did kinda make me smile but such a good actor could have been used better I think.

It's hard to steal the scene from McCathy but now we see it can be done by Leslie Jones and Kate McKinnon (2 of my favorites from SNL) Hemsworth was terrific too. There were even some scary scenes (but nothing to bad for the little ones). Great to see McCarthy in a PG- 13 movie. Director Paul Feig is always best paired with McCarthy.

Kate McKinnon doesn't seem to be comfortable with her character in the beginning, but she quickly gets the hang of it. Melissa McCarthy cannot go wrong in any comedy, as she delivers the laughing moments. Good performance also by Kristen Wiig, who partners perfectly with Melissa. Andy Garcia was simply perfect as mayor. Good touch by placing the main actors from the original cast throughout the film in small parts, which kind of blends the nostalgia of the original film with the innovations of the remake.

For a remake movie, it is definitely one of the worst I have ever had the displeasure of watching & it is an insult to the many times better original. I did not laugh once, & I like to laugh. I enjoy comedies. This is not a comedy. It is a cinema tragedy. It is aggressively feminist & for example, the part of the secretary played by Hemsworth shows the supporting male lead as a painfully thick & moronic dumb-wit with no charm or intelligence. This is compared to the 1984 original where the secretary part is played as a female by Annie Potts. Her portrayal was smart & sharp, feisty & assertive compared to the remakes male thicko. This should never have been remade. This is purely an attempt for the studio to reassign lovable & original characters to a female & modern audience instead of using the same energy to develop fresh strong characters within a newly written role.",Ghostbusters
901,dougieritch,#TERRIBLE,2,4 February 2018,"This movie had the initial hurdle of attempting to remake a classic film in Ghostbusters (1984). I generally like all four female cast members and find them funny (SNL, etc); however, the script and directing for this movie were TERRIBLE and didn't allow them to shine. There were a couple of times I laughed a little but it fell short in terms of a ""comedy"" with this cast. On a side note, I did find Chris Hemsworth's performance rather entertaining and funny; it was nice to see his comedic side opposite of the Thor movies. Overall, I do not blame the female cast, the script and directing are to blame; ultimately, I would skip this movie and save two hours of your life.",Ghostbusters
902,CoolX3,An HONEST review,6,16 July 2016,"This is an average to marginally above average movie. Melissa McCarthy is hit or miss for me, but she does well here. Kristen Wiig is always good, McKinnon and Jones both shine and Chris Hemsworth delivers as well. Everyone makes the best of the given material, which is not always great. The banter is good, but the characters can be one-note. Hemsworth is dumb, we get it. He has a few really funny lines, but ""dumb"" is his entire character. Jones has the same one-note problem. McKinnon was my favorite, she brought a sort of Bill Murray quality of not taking the plot seriously. Overall I LOVE that they had an all female cast for a summer action-comedy and I think they got the right actresses for it. However, the overall plot left something to be desired. I would have liked them to explore the main villain a bit more. I get that the joke is that he's a whiny, entitled guy but it would have liked to see him really overreact to rejection. They also don't really bust a lot of ghosts in this movie. They catch maybe one before the climax. So like I said, the acting and line-to-line dialogue was good but the overall writing doesn't really stick. It's entertaining. Don't listen to the original Ghostbusters fanboys who dedicated their time to destroying this movies IMDb rating.",Ghostbusters
903,saurabhjustu,This is just a goo that got into all the cracks !,1,22 September 2016,"first of all, let me just say, after watching this movie, i was truly astonished how in modern age, a publicity team can spin a shitty job on a movie and turn in into some sort of GIRL POWER feminist thing just to cover their tracks of doing a job so marvelously wrong and people still buying that sh*t i mean , if this movie was hated just because of the girl cast, then so would be the New Star Wars which starts the most powerful female character ever to be created. but OH well, no one cares if it is marketed right. Second of all, this movie deserves all the hate it is getting. New ghost busters by Sony got made into another release just because of its fan following. this was nothing major but a goofy light comedy which all of us enjoyed in the originals. turn to the new century where nothing matters but money making for SONY, after bad feed-backs from the fans, SONY turned on the fans, the people because of whom this movie even came into existence ! but who cares ! now about the movie, its just another Unfunny, blunder of a movie which is trying the hardest to make reference to the original series and at the same time trying to shout out that ""no no no, am different am different"", that yeah... its different that this movie is nothing but smelly old poop. loll this movie also proves, that no matter how much talented the cast be, if the director and the studio has an agenda, then they don't even care about the acting or story telling or fans, they will just shove up the sh*t down our throats and call it women haters or just nerds who live in the basement.wake-up call, no more, no more we will take this agenda thing from directors, studios or critics. they can go and be an A hole in their own little world of agendas.PS: if i could, i would give -ve rating to this movie.",Ghostbusters

Talked to a few and they were simply curious about the fuzz, just as me. Alright, let's get to the movie. The female cast is a little awkward, you get the feeling that some actors aren't really that good. They seem to miss their lines or pronouncing the (obviously bad scripted)jokes wrong.

For what it is and what it represents,10,17 July 2016,"Let me start by saying the reason i gave it a 10, is not because it was the best movie in the world, it's a low quality comedy with very cheesy line and extremely dumb almost slap stick humor. But in the low qual Comedy it's a 10. Here's why. It's really light and stupid funny, I have NEVER seen the original ghost buster and my judgment of this movie is not based on that.The movie is exactly what you would expect it to be, fart jokes, sexist jokes, stereotypical humor. And not slightly terrible cgi. None the less you don't go see this movie with the same mindset as Avatar for example or Mommy from Xavier Dolan. But when you expect just that you can immerse yourself in a very fun and youthful Wiig and Mccarthy humor filled movie! I laugh the loudest the WHOLE movie, i might have stopped laughing for 5 min at the most, i was giggling throughout.The other reason i gave this movie a 10 is because of it's all girl cast, not because i'm a feminist because i'm not.

There was laughter and giggles from all over the theater throughout the entire movie and most of the audience sat through the credits to the scene at the end too! And as soon as that had ended both my boys turned to me and said ""I hope they make a sequel"". And so do I. I've watched the bile spewed on this movie with growing horror for months - the fact that something can be so universally slated before anyone has seen it (and for such ridiculous reasons) just amazes me, and I was so glad that the actual movie was as good as it was. I haven't had such fun at the movies since The Force Awakens. The characters were fresh and engaging (Kate McKinnon's character Jillian Holtzmann was fantastic and a firm favorite with my family), the humor was sharp and in the majority hit the mark and the nice little nods to the earlier movies (cameos, lines etc.) were well played and added a nice nostalgic touch to the proceedings. All I can say is, I really enjoyed it and came out feeling very happy. This morning my sons were talking enthusiastically about it over breakfast and wanting to see it again.

908,xhearto,My 4 cents,8,30 July 2016,"saw it twice, first on opening day due to a political theory I have about America's ability to accept Women in roles of power.( passiveconsumer. blogspot.com) I was very happy with the comedy and chemistry of it but was less than enthused about the effects. Went back to see it in 3D on the advice of a friend and was much happier with the effects, as well as the jokes I missed the first time. Will watch it again and look forward to the blooper reel.Originally my only requirement for this movie was that it be better than my memory of Ghostbusters 2, which I have always harbored a grudge against. & it was. But then I watched #2 again and you know, pretty good! Such great chemistry between Murray & Weaver ( was she really Ripley?!) and the geekspeak and writing for Dan and Harold was executed like surgery.then, I was finally able to find a copy of 1, (thanks Christine!) and frankly, my surprise at how much I liked #2 was equaled by my surprise at how much I was blushing during #1. #1 is not a kid friendly movie! Even though I watched it a million times growing up, and it has a pg rating, #1 is much more adult than any of its counterparts. Did a ghost just go Lovelace on Dan!? Did the gatekeeper and the keymaster just wake up from a one night stand?! That's how Zul returns!?! Wow.After watching them all again, the newest might actually be my favorite.",Ghostbusters

And it gets harder and harder to please yours truly closing on the 40th mark.Everyone gave a solid performance and for a light entertaining movie which takes its own interpretation of the Ghostbusters story, it was pretty well written.

913,ShadowPhoenix37,Surpasses the original,9,19 July 2016,"I loved this movie. The original Ghostbusters movies are iconic and very difficult to follow, but I felt this movie did them justice.There were quite a few shoutouts to the original movies that I really enjoyed (as did pretty much everyone in the theater, judging from the laughter and applause), but it still felt like a great stand alone movie. Instead of being copies of the men from the original, each woman was her own character, and each was likable, funny and relateable.The special effects were fantastic, and they were so much fun to watch. I have rewatched the older version several times over since childhood, but honestly, it holds up less each time. It's really great to have a version that meets the standards we have in place today.This movie felt familiar, but fresh at the same time. All the main characters were complex, with both positive and negative traits, but ended up being wonderful on the whole. The entire theater was laughing, whooping and clapping throughout. Original cast members popped up throughout the movie, in fun and unexpected ways. While there was some occasional gross out humor, it didn't rely solely on it to be funny. I found so much to like about this movie, its pacing, its innocence (there's so much focus on gritty/edgy movies and shows now, and I was really glad this movie didn't follow suit), its stand out characters, its self awareness, and the ways it played to both old and new fans.There are a few jokes that fall flat, in my opinion, and I don't know that I would consider this movie 'hilarious' like some have. But that's a good thing. Yes, it's fun to watch something that is purely comedy, but it feels better to watch something that's more well rounded. It means rewatches can be just as satisfying (for me, at least). And I found myself really caring about the characters and what happened to them.Honestly, the one and two star reviews for this movie simply aren't justified, and it's blatantly obvious they're coming from misogynists. Maybe a movie like this isn't everyone's cup of tea, and that's fine, but I can't find much to criticize about it. (There is some valid concern about Patty being a stereotype, but I still think Leslie did the role justice and I really adored Patty as a character.) When you remake a movie like Ghostbusters, there's always going to be people who feel like nothing can stand up to the original, but the hatred for this film feels like it goes way beyond that.This is a great film, for a lot of reasons, but especially because there are women kicking butt in it. I can't think of many movies with a female character that is allowed to fight and be gross and weird, nevermind several of them. Holtzmann, who has more or less been confirmed as a lesbian, is such an important character for nerdy girls/women, particularly if they are gay/bi or neurodivergent (mentally ill, autistic, etc). The women are different heights, ages and weights, and none are unfairly sexualized, and it was so incredibly refreshing. All the women are brilliant in different ways and totally own it, and I'm so very excited for all the young girls seeing this movie, who will finally get to see characters like them on screen.Please see this movie, it's fabulous. I know the original holds a special place in a lot of people's hearts (mine included), but the remake really holds its own, and even outshines its predecessors.",Ghostbusters
914,spam-917-215663,Melissa McCarthy is the worst,1,18 August 2016,"I expected a feminism driven movie, I got a heavily feminism driven movie. The ""jokes"" fall flat with few exceptions, some are racist and some are pure feminist men-hating jokes. Which is probably also the reason why they made Chris Hemsworth as dumb as a caveman in this one. They basically allowed him to be able to speak the same language, that's it. Surprisingly, not even IMDb lists him in the main-cast list without having to follow the ""See full cast"" link. The actual ""story"" is extremely short. The writers waste most of the time assembling the crew, which doesn't even make any sense at all. The character ""Patty"" for example just quits her job at the New York metro to join Ghostbusters after meeting them ONCE.This movie seems like it was written, produced and directed by Melissa McCarthy herself because she's desperately trying to be the center of attention every scene she's in. I don't even want to know how she got to play the role in the first place. Certainly not because of her talent as an actress. Probably because she's a feminist herself so the feminists behind this movie wanted someone to represent. And just like feminism this movie disappoints. All other actors were OK, the character Patty was actually funny at times, despite what I read about her in another review. All-in-all it felt like the actual ghost-busting was 5 minutes at the end and that's it. The rest was just preparing the stage for it.

I'm not talking a Disney or Pixar film. It's been a while. I left this moving feeling energized and happy. NO superhero movie of late made me feel that way, perhaps with the exception of Guardians of the Galaxy. Simply put, this film gives the appropriate nods to where it came from, and starts to make it it's own. It's humor is funny AND deliberate. It's okay to not want to see this. If what you see in the trailer doesn't appeal to you, then don't go see it. That's what a trailer is for. That being said, leaving the nostalgia where it belongs (30 years in the past), just go enjoy this. Keep in mind the original Ghostbusters films are perfect. Far from it. All female cast? Awesome. Why not? Go ahead, ask yourself. My only hope is that they continue making it their own, entertaining franchise going forward now that they've given tribute to the false god that *suddenly* everyone started worshiping once they had their man-hoods threatened by an all female cast. Loved it. No, it's not perfect... but a small few are. The whole concept of ""Ghostbusters"" is ridiculous any way. Just like all the super hero movies. We still go and accept them, though, with a grain of salt. So please don't elevate or compare this film to something they sloppily threw together in the 80's, or films they make now to OBVIOUSLY sell shirts, video games, toys, comics, TV spin offs...

917,varun030802,Neither the spectacle that it should've been nor the disaster that it could've been,7,31 July 2016,"The original Ghostbusters was pure joy because it had the guts to explore 4 unfit men's lives trying to trap ghosts in a metallic box and achieved great popularity amongst all kinds of viewers due to the sheer joy that it was filled with. This much maligned remake may not be as great as the original and a debate against the second one will be long, it has a few great moments, thanks to the noticeable chemistry shared by the leads, it's relevance to the modern world, great gags and Chris Hemsworth who proves his comic worth throughout the film. It does have its issues as well including negligible sense of conflict, the worst villain of the summer and Leslie Jones' needlessly sassy and annoying performance along with the feeling that it's basically a rip-off of the original.The issues first because I have to get them out of my system urgently. Firstly, the villain pretty much sucks and no one even remembers that he is in the movie until he captures one of the employees at the Ghostbusters. Leslie Jones starts out somewhat interestingly but by the mid- point, she gets more sassy woman with issues and less of the memorable Winston from the original which is disheartening because it gives more reason for nay-sayers to hate the film. The finale may be a visual treat and keeps us entertained on a stylish scale, it is not very satisfactory on an emotional level because we know that they are returning for a sequel or two and the villain is pretty much every MCU villain of all-time as the writers try too hard too make him relatable and sympathetic. Now, to the good stuff.The jokes were supposed to be good and they were mostly good if not completely memorable and probably relied a little too much on the slapstick talents of the actors despite having tid-bits of interesting social commentary that are funny and quiet noticeable too. Kirsten Wiig and Melissa McCarthy may have chemistry and superb comic talents, Chris Hemsworth and Kate McKinnon steal the movie with the former appearing as an overwhelmingly dumb character and the latter being weirdly entertaining and exciting throughout. The visuals are rich and much upto several other blockbusters of similar scales but it seems too much for a movie whose USP is that it is a comedy set amongst ghosts. The action reinvents a lot of stuff and the technology used in the climax certainly makes the team a really bad-ass one despite taking a little from here and there. So, it succeeds as a female-driven comedy and even as a large-scale blockbuster which may not be a complete home run but is a rare kind of summer movie that is pure joy and not needlessly dark and gritty.The cameos, lastly, are a mixed bag as Bill Murray's debunker role is very disappointing despite irony being on it's side. Dan Aykroyd comes out of nowhere and his cameo is quite rushed. Ernie Hudson appears too but it isn't anywhere remarkable and for some, even noticeable which provides some disappointment. Harold Ramis is given his due credit here and there if close attention is paid whereas Sigourney Weaver returns for a while and knocks out-of-the-park but only for a few seconds. Wish Rick Moranis made a temporary return as well.Overall, the new Ghostbusters is a bundle of joy despite low amounts of tension and conflict which is covered with funny gags and great efforts from the leads. Thankfully, the nay-sayers where horribly wrong and misguided as the venture is neither the series' darkest hours nor is it the brightest. Nevertheless, I am excited for a sequel.",Ghostbusters

There are no chemistry in cast, the dated and repetitive jokes don't work, the visual effects look like a Scooby doo knock off, the cameos from the original are poorly used, the villian is forgettable, the writing/plot should have been looked at again. The fans hated it, the audience didn't like it, the critics are mixed.

So I am not another one of those men who hates leading women or can't think they are funny.I paid extra to watch it in 3D and the Dbox (the seat that moves with the action). It still wasn't enough to save the movie. I am not a hater. I obviously paid my hard earned money in order to be entertained. Chris Hemsworth saved the movie. I just find it ironic that it took a man, who is not even a comedian to get all the laughs in the movie. But the 4 leading women did not get any laughs from the audience. The effects were top notch and I enjoyed the action sequences and my rumbling D-box and 3D gimmicks made up for the bad movie that it was. If I watched it in 2D, there would be no saving it. Kristen Wiig was genuinely good in this movie and brought some heart and emotion to the character. She was doing her best to do a good job, but the rest of the actresses seemed to be trying so hard to be funny and quirky and it just came off as lame and ultra cringe. The biggest offender of this was Kate McKinnon - she was trying WAY too hard to be funny and quirky. It seemed so forced.Nothing about the movie felt epic or larger than life. Nobody in the theater laughed at any of the ladies trying to be funny, but they laughed at Chris Hemsworth's character, who was genuinely funny. My biggest gripe; Every man in this movie is portrayed in this movie as incompetent, a creep, or dumb. There is not a single male character in here that a young boy can look up to. Yet another disturbing trend on today's culture where people feel a need to make men look bad in order to elevate women.

This is without doubt the worst franchise reboot I have ever had the misfortune of watching and having some of the original cast making cameos just made it even worse,and to be honest,more insulting.

It turned out that Ghostbusters 2016 was a sloppy soup of nonchalant mediocrity, that became insipid after the beginning of the movie and in the end was going straight down the drain. Paul Feig doesn't seem to care a blip about the movie -- the money he got for directing it was probably enough -- and I am sure he and his PR-team at least had a great time with provoking the critics and trolling media with the notion that all is about ""anti-feminism"" and ""racism"".

A true testament of North American fanboyism and a remarkable ability to forget the past. I found the movie to be funnier as I watched it again and again. I don't think it's amazing but it is far better than, say, Ghostbusters 2 which even now has seemed to hit some movie history blind spot that these idiot fanboys seem to forget was a horrid second entry to a very funny movie in the first Ghostbusters. I found these 4 women to be funny and play well off each other. Chris Hemsworth's comedic beats were high points to the film and I found myself chuckling with every interaction he had with the women. Again, this is not an amazing movie but it certainly doesn't deserve the hatred that it seems to have received especially in light of the last entry into this franchise.

929,robstemakin,The good the bad and the ugly,5,21 July 2016,"I had read a number of reviews before going to see the movie, so it's fair to say my expectations where pretty low going in. I didn't let that put me off, as I was a kid at the time of the originals and loved them both, so I almost felt compelled to watch the latest release.I'm afraid to say that it wasn't a patch on the originals, even Ghostbusters 2 is far superior. The effects are very good, which is not really much of a positive as it is what we come to expect from a blockbuster movie. That said, their is nothing particularly eye popping about the effects.The script was pretty similar to the original as well, which may have been expected, but there is very little to set it apart from previous movies. The one thing that does set it apart, is that there are several comedy scenes that are hear a pin drop terrible. It's hard to watch at times as they are embarrassingly unfunny.The female cast had been a point of controversy for many die hard Ghostbusters fans and there were a few jabs at it within the movie. The cast are a mix of good, average and terrible. The good being Kristen Wiig, Melissa McCarthy and Chris Hemsworth, the average being Patty Nolan and the completely terrible Kate McKinnon. The chemistry between Wiig and McCarthy is very good, it works and the best comedy moments in the movie involve those two. Nolan does a good job but is not always given the best lines to work with. McKinnon is just outright annoying and over the top. She plays an eccentric, off the wall technical expert, but comes off over the top, unlikable and for completely unfunny. It would be fair to say that her character ruined the movie for me. Then their is Hemsworth, the Ghostbusters secretary and for me was the best character in the movie by far, the only male member of the Ghostbusters company. This may well be one big smug 'I told you so' for all those who bemoaned the female cast.All in all it was an average movie.",Ghostbusters
930,gbofaisst,The Worst Reboot!,1,20 October 2016,"I'm A Sexist Manchild...Or Am I?This is where we're at, folks. A good SNL skit spoofing a bad Ghostbusters movie is ""Certified Fresh."" Thankfully a decade from now no one will care and we'll probably get yet another painful reboot that will manage to somehow be even worse.The perfect metaphors for this movie are in the movie itself. An ugly, bloated, hateful embodiment of the franchise logo literally gets shot in the privates. And that's what this movie is. A big, bloated, cynical crotch shot to the audience. But remember, you're ""sexist"" if you dare not join in on your own punishment, but more on that later. The ""comedy"" here is the equivalent of subtly making a joke and then someone screaming in your face, slapping the crap out of you, demanding you laugh, and sucking all humor right out of the room. By the way, thanks for demonstrating that, Patty. I might have chuckled quietly maybe twice. It's just not funny. This is a movie that literally farts in your face and describes the sound to you. LITERALLY. If that's not the perfect set of metaphors to describe this mess I don't know what is.It reminds me of Will Ferrell movies where the joke lands, but then because the crew was laughing the actors keep going, just saying random nonsense until someone says cut, and by the time the scene ends the joke that was funny at first is now buried beneath an avalanche of useless garbage. Just because you laugh on set doesn't mean the joke will work in theaters, especially since the audience isn't on the set feeling the wacky energy behind the scenes. But watching the interviews with the director he seems completely unaware of this in spite of his years of fine film making. And it shows.Which brings me to another point. The press. It didn't matter whether this movie was good or not, the press tour set the film up for failure from the start. This movie's pre-release press tour was the Donald Trump campaign of film. Pretending to be more than it is while pissing on the intended audience and claiming it's raining. By claiming the system was rigged by misogynist fanboys before the movie was even released they could excuse their failure by claiming ""conspiracy."" I'll grant you, those guys exist, but they are a tiny percentage blown out all proportion by a studio doing damage control just to get the movie more free press space. And all they did was give a microphone to the haters and then go and prove them right.This movie is cynicism masquerading as film. It tried it's hardest to be something more, and then got hamstrung by a studio and a director that had the same sense of purpose and care for the consumer as a slimy used car salesman. This is the rusted out Chevy in the corner of the lot that got badly restored by a 1st year C Grade mechanics student running on Redbull and misguided sponsorships from whoever was stupid enough to think funding the thing would make them ""hip."" And then they claim the consumer did something wrong when it all falls apart. ""It broke when you drove it? What did you do?!""I wanted so badly for this movie to work. It doesn't. It's broken. Effects, character building, script, the painfully forced cameos (except Ernie Hudson, his was OK), the Adam Sandler level product placements...it just...doesn't...work. Moments that could have been amazing, like the final battle are dragged into an eye rolling comedy wasteland through the actors mugging and spewing terrible, forgettable one-liners right after. You want to cheer, but you just feel insulted. There is no excusing or fixing this wreck. Crush it and sell it for scrap.I'd almost feel bad trashing this movie if Sony wasn't involved, but look at their track record. This is the company that keeps flooding the market with Sandler films. The company that made ""The Amazing Spider- Flop: Screw You Rami,"" and ""The Amazing Spider-Flop 2: The Desperation Continues."" They're making an EMOJI movie, for goodness' sake. Pixels? I can't feel bad for this movie or anyone involved because they knew what companies were involved and they knew what that meant.Sony, get out of the film industry entirely, shut down your distribution division, and go back to being a purely electronics manufacturing based company. You're a goldfish trying to climb a tree. Get back in your pond.And finally, about that ""You're a sexist manchild if you don't like it"" stuff?My exact sarcastic words were, ""Thank you ever so much for making we waste two hours of my life.""",Ghostbusters
931,doomhealer,Umm...just don't.,1,17 October 2016,"Look I can't control what you can and can't watch but I can make recommendations. This movie is a remake. Nothing more and as far as remakes go it is awful. There is nothing that could make me say anything good other than that it has science stuff.*Probably some spoilers in the rest of this review*As most of you are aware, the trailer has been the most disliked trailer in YouTube history and that is a hard thing to accomplish. The movie is, as I said before, a remake that was under the premise of being a sequel. There is little to no reason as to why it was made as it shouldn't exist. Now onto why:1: Complete change of cast, and not the normal change. Look when a movie is remade they generally get actors similar in gender/color/look (facial features) or at the very least people who make sense. The director changed all the genders to make a movie that appealed to the feminist demographic and completely abandoned the originals. If you think this is the only reason let me say that people would be just as angry if Katniss became Katnick the scrawny white dude.2: The entire thing. Unfunny, more centered towards kids than adults who would actually remember the original Ghostbusters and used the nerdy side to only barely engage anyone who understood science at all.3: Pre-release media. Do you remember when the internet lost it's mind at the trailer? Remember what the cast/actors/director/staff/everyone did in return? No? Let me remind you. People said they didn't like the trailer with comments on YouTube. The director decided ""Hey, lets read out these comments and put them in the movie"". People wrote bad reviews after seeing it or as a prediction. Suddenly everyone is sexist/racist (Note that the film had a handsome actor playing a moronic character, the villain got his thing shot off and the black woman is street smart and a stereotypical black woman (Just a little bit incredibly racist)).Ghostbusters 2016 is to Ghostbusters 2 what Ghostbusters 2 was to Ghostbusters.

932,tonysundell,One of the worst movies I've ever seen,1,8 August 2016,"The one movie that was so horrible that I felt writing my first IMDb review is an obligation toward betterment of human race. Here's the sin list:* Copy n' paste original movies' plot line without understanding how to mimic the success or why it was successful in the first place. * Not sure if it's fault of the script or the director, but this movie is a mess of plot that doesn't know what it wants to be, bad spacing and jokes that don't hit the mark.* Characters are underdeveloped and flat and they never grow into any direction. Only redeeming character being Holtzmann, who is the most interesting out of the bunch. The worse character in whole movie is the main villain that is so forgettable that you might not remember him existing at all. * 200 million marketing budget apparently buys a lot of shill marketing and paid reviews. Don't trust anything you read on the internet about the movie, gender issues are just a smoke screen to hide movie's bad quality. * Cameos are mostly unnecessary and embarrassing. They just keep throwing them at you randomly. Only exception being Phil Murray who's ghost skeptic character works okay for the short moment he appears on screen.* Movie's internal logic and rules get bend in the last action sequence where suddenly ghosts don't have to be trapped due their lasting ghost form, but instead can now be killed... by slashing them into pieces. There are few cool action scenes in the end but they don't fit in with the characters who didn't grow into any direction during the movie. From audience's perspective they are still inexperienced trainees in a profession no one has ever done before, but suddenly our main heroes do all kind of cool battle stunts and gymnastics despite of having background as a scientists. If they had background and expertise in other areas it sure was not told. Another spacing wrecking moment is the part where several ghost destroying equipment gets introduced out of the sudden but these machines of death are never used in the movie, well apart the one that was never introduced before. * Product placement. In Sony movies the only place where end battle can happen is at New York's Time Square. The reason? It has the most product placement real estate of all of the locations in world. Pringles, 7eleven, H&M and Starbucks came out of nowhere without any reason for being there and one of the main characters might have just turned their eye contact directly toward the camera and sang a commercial in middle of the movie out of blue. It would have been a lot more sincere. I wouldn't advice anyone to see this abomination. As far as reboots go, this is just as bad as the new Robocop was.",Ghostbusters

940,deronny66,Good Fun - Haters gunna Hate,7,13 July 2016,"It's sad that I can't review this film without the context of the preceding ""controversy"" surrounding its release. Where have all these 'die hard' ghostbusters fans come from? The original was great, sure, but let's be honest, for most of us it's a very enjoyable 'spooky comedy' rather than a life changing holy grail of cinema. So the overstated enthusiasm for the original at the time of writing is fairly exhausting.I'll keep it short.The film 2016 was impressively consistently funny, as evidenced by the numerous collective belly laughs in the cinema I attended. There were some misses too, much in the way an episode of, say, Family Guy has hits and misses, but the laughs outweighed the troughs. Actually, in terms of the audience's reactions to the jokes, I'd go as far as saying it was more consistently funny than your average episode of Family Guy (which has loads of misses all the time). Obviously the humour and style is different, so don't take that comparison as an absolute. But Ghostbusters 2016 was very funny in places.The film triumphed over the pre-release criticisms that this was pandering to feminism. The issue didn't cross my mind at all. The characters and the actors were enjoyable. There was a decent explanation to all the ghostbusters' reasons for being part of the team. You'd have to enter the cinema wanting to be annoyed at this for it to actually be an issue. I'm a 28 year old male, by the way, as ridiculous as it is for me to confirm that.The film isn't great though. It starts strong and, somewhere mid-way, begins to approach its climax clumsily. Things go from 'investigations' to 'total apocalypse' very quickly and get resolved equally quickly. Also, all the throwbacks to the original end up feeling forced and a bit awkward. It would be better without the cameos. The failings of this film are not linked to its pre-release criticisms.If you want to have some fun, like you would when going to see any comedy, then this is worth your time. If you have low expectations, give it a chance and you will probably enjoy yourself.",Ghostbusters

It points to a huge conspiracy plot in the movie industry. This movie was a REMAKE. What do you all expect. The story is going to be similar/the same, only this time the CGI was a thousand times better and they used a team of girls instead of men. I read a comment saying this was a man hating movie - such nonsense only displays that the person who made those comments has some serious insecurity issues.I sat in an Imax with the kids thinking 'the reviews are horrendous, what have I let myself in for'. As a result of the bad press there were only 8 people in the entire Imax for the showing (including my family of four). What followed was great great fun. It was funny. Even the team of women played their characters so well you could see who they 'were' in terms of the original movie. The male receptionist 'Kevin' WAS the exact male equivalent of the original airhead. My 6 year old who is a great fan of the original LOVED it, so much so that after finishing this review I have been persuaded by the two kids to take them back for a second showing today.There were huge nostalgic parts to the movie with cameo appearances for all but one of the original cast. Stop trying to compare the movie to the original and saying ""it was too similar""it was a remake for Gods sake. The four leading ladies worked, the male airhead receptionist worked and made it all the more funny.

Let's put it this way--we see 2 or more movies every week during the summer (I am still trying to get the smell of that awful INDEPENDENCE DAY: RESURGENCE 3D off me.) This film was one of the most fun---it's an old-fashioned summer, popcorn muncher, just the kind of film I wanted after a hectic week at work. By the way, stay through all the credits.",Ghostbusters
946,cmcelraft,Nope not the original,5,26 July 2018,"Ok, so it's not the original movie that won our hearts in 1984. However, it didn't ruin my childhood either. Kate McKinnon's pseudo Egon character is Ober the top strange and annoying, but watching her on SNL, makes me believe that she is naturally strange and unfocused. Leslie Jones, steals the movie! I really like her character and her persona in general. 
Ghostbusters: Answer The Call, is not for diehard fans, it's not a great reboot either. It's a movie that you need to watch with the idea that it's just a fun movie about a group of ladies who are trying to capture ghosts. Don't over expect! The end credit scene seems to set up for a sequel, but I think there is too much hate for this one.",Ghostbusters

951,McFly_2015,"terrible marketing, decent film",7,21 July 2016,"The 4 female leads were fairly good especially Kate McKinnon. Some people expected them all to be individual female clones of the male ghostbusters but they weren't, they were their own individual characters. Chris Hemsworth comes across as a pleasant surprise in the secretary role. It's hard to look at the film as its own entity without comparing it to what came before as the overall plot is similar and it does add many references. It is at least respectful to the source material and doesn't attempt to lampoon the former films. It definitely had its laughs but the humour seemed more forced.Now the big elephant in the room was how were gender roles addressed? You can easily tell the target audience was females (both adults and children) which I didn't have a problem with. I half expected it to be extremely feminist and demeaning towards men with a bunch of misogynistic male characters acting demeaning to women but they didn't do that. There's antagonistic male and female characters so they didn't make gender much of an issue. They also didn't turn it into a chick flick which was good, Hemsworth's character is clearly portrayed as a dumb sex object but it's at least done in a humorous way. Females will probably like it more than males which is fine, I still enjoyed it for the most part and of course the original two films still exist. I'm sure in school yards boys and girls will argue which version is better so at the end of the day both sides have their own. Where it definitely lacked was the main villain and his motives. Gozer, Zuul, and Vigo were all terrifying villains with clear aspirations. This time around it felt like more of a cheap rehash of the first film. The plot in general is the weakest of the three ghostbuster films. I liked how the first films incorporated paranormal psychology (aka parapsychology) as opposed to simply having a bunch of ghosts out there for the heroes to catch, this one didn't divulge much into paranormal psychology, possibly because the bad guy pulling all the strings is human for most of the film and using the paranormal as a means to power. Also the new title track from Fall Out Boy is awful but luckily we do get one short rendition of the Ray Parker classic. Where it ended up better? The visuals are very impressive and the film used modern technology and 3D to its advantage. There were more ghosts and ghost bustings than the original film, the ghostbusters also had more tools than the standard proton packs and traps. I will say it has the best end credits of any film I'd ever seen, it actually gave a reason to watch the entire credits instead of just sticking around to see if anything else came. Final thoughts? Definitely not as good as the first two. It's a great theatre experience in 3d and I'd definitely recommend it but once it goes to home video and television, it might not be that re-watchable. I don't plan on purchasing it when it comes out, maybe in a few years I'll watch it again. I'd rate it 6.5/10",Ghostbusters

955,showem,"Starts slow, but gets there in the end.",7,16 July 2016,"Let me tell you what I didn't like first. It's a bit slow to start and is too full of pseudo- scientific chatter. They could have tried for a few more jokes early on, so that the few that fell flat didn't stick out as the only poor attempts. The editing was also slightly odd at points, going between a few scenes with no transition, leaving you wondering why they were there. Not anything as big as missing plot points, just slightly confusing, taking you out of the movie. But here's what I did like: the Holtzmann and Patty characters are well done. I was worried after seeing the trailer that they would be superficial and very stereotypical, but they were good. Kirsten Wiig's and Melissa McCarthy's characters didn't quite hit the mark as well, as their relationship wasn't covered well enough and I think suffered at the hands of editing again. They do have some funny interactions at points at least. It was fun spotting the cameos from the original cast.But the best thing was the action scenes with the ghosts were GREAT! Really well filmed, and the dialogue, jokes, action and all the rest seemed to click together better during them. Of course there's a big action climax finale, so by the end it was a much better film than when it started. Is it a cinematic masterpiece? No. But neither is the original movie. It's a decent summer action film once the action gets going. Go have fun.",Ghostbusters
956,wwolfmin,It's just a mixed bag,5,18 July 2016,"Which is why I am giving it a five. Dislikes: 1) They made the movie self-aware. The original Ghostbusters was funny because of the situations and the commentaries by Peter on them. Example: when tracking slimmer in the original. Ray suggests they should split up, Egon agrees, and Peter makes the one liner ""we can do more damage that way"". They pass this style back in forth all through the movie. But at the core it is just 4 working stiffs that found something they were good at. 2) It is four Peter Venkmans and Kevin. They are all immature, there is no scientist, no childlike engineer, and blue collar worker. Just four comedians that try to one up each other. They have interesting characters, but they do not stick with that. Instead they just become four comedians trying to one up each other. In the original you know Ray was the one that messed up with bring the Stay Puft, why because he is the child like, fascinated by all of this and an engineer. By the end of the new Ghostbusters, they all came off as just the same character played by four people. Each basically showing off their one shot toys and each with the same look on their face. 3) They lost the threat. This one could have had a great threat to it. But the bad guy opening the portals should not have been the main threat. He was more like a minion who would have brought about Gozer, and Gozer would have probably killed him. Then have them battle that threat. I'm not asking for Gozer and actually am glad they did not go that route yet. But the pain and suffering that this bad guy brought was just watching him in that third act. He was great up until then. But they made a comedy instead of an adventure, horror, comedy, fantasy. 4) did not really need to be a reboot. The story was different, the people are different, the weapons are different. Should have just called it part 3 or 4 depending if you count the 2009 game. 5) The characters: Patty - should have been Kylie Griffin. Manager of an Occult bookstore that would have tied the scientist to the supernatural Holtzmann - should have stayed with the crazy mad scientist engineer. When she turns comedian instead of genius, she kind of lost me. Setting the lab on fire was good and the inventing and trying things out was good. The fart jokes, the mocking the government is where she is lost on me. Abby - should have been obsessed with the science to have actually built things. Instead she comes off as an idiot. The PK-Meter never done that before. Well who built the thing, maybe they should run it. Erin - should have been the comedian, or pure straight person. Brought in by her past which was good. The lady ghost standing at the foot of her bed, should have came back to either warn them or be the main villain. To me this was a waste of a good back story. Kevin - should have been just as involved but change him to the delivery guy of the Chinese restaurant who thinks he is the secretary for the Ghostbusters. Every line and funny moment just the same, only Erin could have meet him at Abby's lab only to have the office become upstairs to that restaurant. They could still rescue him at the end (with a better Villain). His flaw is they gave him the same line as Annie Pots right after she said it perfectly. 6) testing of field equipment. Why an Alley. We came to see Ghostbusters, not a paper ghost on a pole being shot at. All of this test equipment could have been played out on actual captures instead of an alley.Likes: 1) they tried. Better than just having it sit on the shelf, and nobody else was able to get it done. And they are going to try again (you either improve or get worse). They have funny lines, equipment, and ghost. If everything was told as it being actual instead of a joke it might have worked for me. 2) They put in a ton of references to the other movie. This movie I think will be watched and viewed over and over again as just a reference spotter. How many Easter eggs, cameos, and lines can you spot? This is going to be a cult classic just for that. I may still be laughing at it for years to come. 3) Mike Hat the Dog. Just about anything that was improvised by Chris Hemsworth was just odd, quirky, and the best parts of the movie. Chris may actually get more than just muscle roles after this. 4) Almost a super slammer. The greatest invention of all time was taking the Ecto-1 and adding a massive trap to the top of it for major ghost haunting. Although the movie does not give us this, it got close to it. But there was a lot of good new equipment, not all but enough. 5) crossing over to the other side. Some of the best stories for Ghostbusters usually had the team entering into the containment unit to find something. The movie almost got this. 6) the amount of graphics and details to them. Sure you may think it was poor CGI. But there is a style to it and there are more details there then what you first see. Blu-ray will probably bring those out. 7) the actors. I think they picked good people for this movie. If the characters were more defined each of them could have played with it more within their style. 8) the possibility of a director's cut. the director said he filmed almost four hours worth of a movie. There is probably a lot that should have been left in to make more sense of things.",Ghostbusters
957,izokial,Probably my favourite film,9,4 July 2020,"Firstly: the extended edition features some GLORIOUSLY awkward acting from Kristen Wiig but also trades out some excellent lines for alternatives ones, so I recommend seeing both.Secondly: this film is just so much FUN. Kate McKinnon absolutely ROCKS IT as Jillian Holtzmann, Chris Hemsworth DEFINES the word ""himbo"", there's some awesome new weapons, the team are likeable... it was just amazing to go back into the cinema and experience a PROPER Ghostbusters film, with the special effects and everything, on the big screen. Since then I've bought a couple of DVD versions and watched them a whole lot of times. If I ever need something fun and guaranteed to make me smile, it always does the trick.Full disclosure: I'm a biiiig Ghostbusters fan; I love the movies, the cartoons, the comics.

962,thunderclancat,I wanted to root for the ghosts,1,30 January 2017,"I wanted to like this movie because, well, its Ghostbusters, and I adored the first two films. In addition I enjoyed Melissa McCarthy in Spy and Mike and Molly so I thought it might be a enjoyable tribute to the original movies, or at the very least a fun waste of time. I suppose I should have known better,I herd about the dislike of this film, but although i didn't disregard it, I didn't take it as gospel either. Then there was the whole sexism angle to some of the criticism of the film, which Sony milked in order to generate more of a buzz. However I don't believe that the gender of the characters mattered a whit. If the four leads had been men the movie would still be as abominable, because the film is creatively bankrupt.Leslie Jones's character is a wince-inducing stereotype of a black woman. Melissa McCarthy is obsessed with food,(soup plays a running, ah, ""joke"" in the film) I'm guessing because her character is overweight, Wiig and McKinnon were both very blah. Helmsworth's character is a complete dolt and the villain was utterly forgettable. The plot is atrocious, and the story dull. The films throws plentiful, though, quite frankly, not very good, special effects at the viewer in the hopes, I guess, that one forgets the banality of the film. In the original you got the feeling that the actors got along off-screen and the interaction between the leads had warmth. In this film the warmth seems lacking, and the movie suffers. One horrendous scene involves one of the ghost busting team eating Pringles while investigating a call. This scene was particularly grating to me. I thought at it was first because, certain sounds bother me. Thinking about it later, though it was the product-placement that hurt more, the dialogue about the chips was unnecessary and could have been scrubbed from the film. Gentle reader, I warn you, stay far away from this wretched mess.",Ghostbusters

965,pconley22,The Most Fun I've had Watching a Movie in a Long Time!,8,19 July 2016,"As a male nerd who grew up in the 1980's watching both original movies and the cartoon, running around with my toy proton pack and catching imaginary ghosts in my basement, I should be of the demographic complaining about how this ruins my childhood or that a cast of all women is just a stunt in the name of political correctness, or whatever their issue is. But the truth is, I REALLY enjoyed this movie. The four female leads were absolutely hilarious--especially Kate McKinnon who steals every scene she is in. The other three characters have more growth, more of a story arc, and are more fleshed out as people in general. But McKinnon makes the most out of the available material and creates a very fun and memorable character.The comedy of the 2016 version, while equally effective, is completely different from the dry humor of the original. The absence of Dan Aykroyd's and Harold Ramis's ludicrously funny lines delivered with a straight face, and the deadpan humor of Bill Murray has been switched out with a more over-the-top and in-your-face style of humor. It's not as subtle. Ghostbusters (1984) made me chuckle; Ghostbusters (2016) made me laugh out loud.While a lot of the original's comedy came from the ghosts themselves, i.e. that they're funny instead of legitimately scary, the new version reverses that. There is some very creepy imagery involving things like old timey parade balloons, ghosts pushing against mirrors, and other things that seemed inspired by American Horror Story. Plus, there were some good jump scares, boo moments, that actually caught me off guard. Much like a guitar amp out of Spinal Tap, this film turns both the scares and the comedy up to 11 with great results. I haven't had this much fun at a movie in a long time. The trailer is NOT a valid way to judge this film. The trailer seemed to splice together all the ineffective moments and jokes of the film. But those were the exceptions and not the rule. The rule here is fun, entertainment, laughs, and the occasional scare. When the film works, it works remarkably.The only real misstep was Chris Hemsworth's character. While the gender role reversal of the hot blonde ditz secretary was brilliant and long overdue in a mainstream summer movie, he was just too dumb to be believable. The character of Kevin belonged in a cartoon and not a legitimate movie. The best line in the movie references Jaws and Annie Potts' cameo made me cheer. However...If you've already decided you hate this movie without even seeing it, you probably won't like it. That's how these things usually work. But, if you have an open mind and are reserving judgement, I suggest you see it. You will be pleasantly surprised.",Ghostbusters

969,Alessar,A Brilliant Blast of Summer Fun,9,16 July 2016,"In this reboot of the Ghostbusters franchise we are treated to some amazing and fun spectacles, a lot of laughs and big scale action. I usually avoid 3D as it's often poorly done, but I heard this one had good 3D so I saw it in 3D and both the 3D and special effects are very well done. Even if you know that a ghost is a CGI creation it still looks fantastic! The main characters in this film are a nice assortment of personalities and avoid going too far with any stereo types. For instance the character of Patty works for the subway but she is very well versed in city history and civil infrastructure and is presented as an intellectual equal to the rest of the team, who have advanced degrees. All the main team contributes some information, skill, or pluck and you get to enjoy the sense of a team really forming as the weirdness slowly builds. The film really presents the heroes as ""everybodies"" who just step up and do what is right, who make the choice to be good people instead of being hateful and whiny.There aren't really any twists - we can see what's going on with the main story from the get go - but the pacing remains solid. Earlier in the film there's lots of good chuckles and as the action ramps up it takes over from pure comedy. There are a few places the story is a little thin and a couple where it seems to skip something - I suspect that they cut a few scenes that weren't completely essential to keep the fast pace going and it unfortunately showed. At least one cut scene gets shown during the end credits though and it fills in the missing details in an amazing way.I think overall it works really well both as a standalone movie and as a setup for a series. My strongest recommendation - see it in a theater in 3D.",Ghostbusters

972,sam_hososoki,A ghostly experience you'll want to have!,7,20 July 2016,"This Monday just gone I had my second viewing of Ghostbusters and my first in 3D. I can confidently say I didn't expect much from the movie after all the negative press and was treated to a very enjoyable experience. Furthermore it has been a while since there has been a genuinely satisfying comedy at the cinema and Ghostbusters has claimed that success.I will not go into detail on any spoilers that do not appear in the trailers as I feel many of the humorous moments are successful due to the context of the scenes. What I will say is when I saw the theatrical trailer, I thought it had revealed too much but in hindsight I retract that thought. The scene where the demon style ghost stands on Patty Tolan's (Leslie Jones) shoulders and a couple of people take a selfie with them, the events that lead to that situation are much more humorous but are not included in the trailer, which I think is good for the movie as it does not rely on 2-3mins of clips to be entertaining as a whole.While not all the jokes and moments of wackiness worked for me, there isn't any major negative talking points I have on the movie. Kirsten Wig, Melissa McCarty, Kate McKinnon and Leslie Jones all prove they have been well cast and Leslie in particular might just be the funniest with her being the normal, down to earth member of the team.Final thoughts: Ghostbusters has the potential to be this year's movie of the summer and I'm looking forward to having a third viewing; something I haven't done since the newest Star Wars was showing at the cinema. The girls are great in their roles and a splash of Hemsworth and a dab of some special cameos makes this film a highly memorable experience.",Ghostbusters

Clearly once again not funny.I'm basically done writing, but have to fill the space to make this public, so just bottom line, don't bother watching this unless you're looking for some conversation starters to talk about during Thanksgiving dinner, I'm sure whoever you talk to will chime in the same.",Ghostbusters
977,claudjak-864-699400,Funny and Witty,10,15 July 2016,"With a 4.1 rating at the time of the showing, I went expecting the absolute worst. Instead I laughed my ass off. It was so funny and witty. Perhaps because I accepted it for what it is. A totally implausible situation and movie- meant to be funny. I really liked one comment about how in academia one needs to kiss ass till you get tenure- perhaps because I myself am a female professor on that track. Regardless, if you actually catch the under breath comments, which there are many (and what makes the lines witty), you will find it really funny. Totally not a 4.1. I gave it a 10 because it is not meant to be an academy award winning movie, it is meant to be relatively mindless (not referring to stupid but referring to not cerebral), creative, silly, fun humor to enjoy, which is exactly what it was.",Ghostbusters
978,nickpazell1,The second best Ghostbusters movie,7,17 July 2016,"While this film is not perfect, it is a decent and enjoyable film. Far superior to Ghostbusters 2 I might add. Don't listen to the 1/10 ratings on IMDb. A lot of them are trolls who haven't even seen the film yet, they just wanna hate on it. The film does have some trouble spots, but there is a lot that is well done. The action is good, the acting is good, some (not all) jokes land, the cameos were fun. The first 40 minutes of the film were very strong, it kinda got off rails towards the end. That being said, the original Ghostbusters did have the same feel. The ghosts looked cool, especially the first few. Would I watch it again? Yes. Will I get it on DVD? Possibly. My only problem with it is the cheap cash-ins for some of the jokes. Like Patty is just a stereotype, sadly. With that I give this film 6-7/10 for good acting, fun and colorful visuals, decent script, fun cameos, some funny jokes that land, and the characters.",Ghostbusters
979,arnost-matejka-925-69521,So bad it is astonishing,1,5 August 2016,"I am glad i did not pay to see it in cinema, it is so horrible that if written, produced and shot by some group of amateurs it would end up better than it is. Comedy which lack of all fun and story which is actually non existent.So if you go to see it... expect immature humour which is not funny, that movie is trying to show all other then women stupid, shallow or pure evil. When you look on SGI you would not see anything new in fact what was done in late eighties as CGI is looking better and well created instead of the lousy remake of effect within the movie. I do think the whole turn over of this movie is only from people which like me loved previous two and when they sit through this abomination first 20min they wanted to go and get money back.My suggestion is then, do not go for that to cinema, wait for home as this movie will be out from cinema and given to TVs and cable in packages, since Sony will have to pay others to even take it. Thats how this movie is bad...",Ghostbusters
980,MsMelbaToast,From a Woman's Perspective,1,25 July 2016,"I am a woman. I am also a huge fan of the original Ghosbusters movies. I was very reluctant to watch this movie, and I finally broke down and watched it for free. Let me tell you, this movie is absolutely horrible. Not funny. Throwaway characters. Recycled plot. I couldn't even find a single thing I enjoyed. What's sad is this movie seemed to have all of the best ingredients to make a five star meal. Sadly, this is not even tolerable. There are crude anti-male messages scattered throughout the movie. It's like, ""Hey! I get it. Men are evil or stupid."" I don't understand how this film would even be appropriate for children. Sure, some jokes (like vaginal farts!) may fly over their neophyte little minds, but I think it's not a good idea. Any parent that thinks this is appropriate for kids needs to have their kids taken away by Social Services. Seriously. This movie does not promote feminism or girl power or any other such nonsense. It was labeled as a reboot, when in reality, it is a remake, through and through. The jokes are unoriginal and downright stolen from other movies. The feminist supporters and their ridiculous attempts to trick people into seeing this movie almost makes me embarrassed to have a vagina. If you like original movies, funny movies, and even have a modicum of good taste in movies, AVOID. This is just a cash grab and nothing else.",Ghostbusters
981,edhuang-toronto,Pretty much as expected. Flat and not really funny,2,25 July 2016,"Well, I had planned on skipping this movie altogether but I got dragged to a 3D screening by someone and ended up giving this a chance anyway.It's not good. The jokes were old and stale and flat. Chemistry was marginal between the main characters and the only black Ghostbuster was portrayed as a stereotype. The men are all stupid or evil, as others have said. In the original, the receptionist was smart and sassy and sarcastic. This remake, he was DUMB and DUMBER. The whole movie was insulting to men and sexist. The gadgets didn't make sense and their effect varied across the plot line. The ghosts were a little dated in terms of CGI effects and were not scary at all.Unlike the original, where the comedy was organic to the plot line and situation, this story tried to set up obvious punchlines throughout.But no, it wasn't absolute garbage, just a bland attempt to remake a studio-franchise. The cameos by the old cast only frustrated me more as they reminded me of what could have been a much better movie integrating the old cast with the new. Watch it on Netflix for free when it comes out.",Ghostbusters
982,N_animator,"Good effort, but adequate result",6,19 July 2016,"I was one of the people who was really looking forward to this film. I knew since the official video game came out that we would never get a Ghostbusters 3 in cinema, and when I saw the first trailer I thought it would be a ""passing the torch"" kind of film where a new team takes over the business. I was very disappointed when I learned this was going to be a straight-up remake, where none of the previous movies wouldn't even matter.The movie has a good strong start. It sets the tone of the movie really well, and we get introduced to the three first main characters almost right away. It has a good pacing, which leads to adding the last main character and the supporting character, and immediately the audience know that this is a fun movie that doesn't take itself seriously. Sadly things starts to fall apart in Act 2. Almost every joke falls flat. The characters has very little chemistry with each other, and the villain is unoriginal and uninteresting. It is a bad sign when Chris Hemsworth is the only one who is consistently funny, and he's not even a professional comedian. The main plot is on rails, and the sub-plot of the mayor trying to shut down the Ghostbusters makes no sense in context. Ghostbusters just follows the path set by the original without adding anything of substance, and whatever new they add just feels hollow. Like a checklist.Things does not get any better in Act 3. The villain just instantly get super-powers without any explanations, The Ghostbusters has somehow acquired superior agility and marksmanship abilities after just a few test shots in an alley, and the ghosts looks like they were taken straight out of the live-action Scooby-Do films. In the end I just felt tired and bored.The film does have its strong points. The pacing is very good and it smoothly sets the tone of the film. Even though the CGI looks way too cartoony for my taste, I did really like the designs for each ghost. The set designs are very clever, and I liked the idea of replacing the old ambulance with a hearse. All the actors did a good job in portraying the personality of each character, and I especially liked Leslie Jones as she was definitely the strongest actor of all four.I wouldn't recommend a watch since it's the kind of movie that won't add or subtract anything from your love of Ghostbusters. Wait for a home video release as it's not really worth rushing to the cinemas to watch.",Ghostbusters

It was a fun movie",Ghostbusters
984,murphyollie08,Good but not great,5,12 July 2016,"I recently saw the film at a cineplex near me. I am a fan of the originals and will admit my original misogyny when I heard they were recasting with women but after seeing the first two promos I was mildly swayed and decided to give the new film a chance. I admire the angle that this film was made at, they wanted to appease old fans whilst paving the way for future movies. I found the movie overall very funny with the funniest parts being throwaway lines and even found Chris Hemsworth very funny a lot of the time. I also rather enjoyed cameos from the various original cast of Ghostbusters in what appeared to be polar opposites to their original roles except from Annie Potts playing another loudmouth receptionist. Whilst I was disappointed that Rick Moranis didn't make a cameo (I thought he was dead) I am happy there was support from the original cast with Bill Murray and co. Overall I found the film to be very pleasing, consistently chuckle worthy and gave a nice nod to the original.",Ghostbusters
985,movieMaoam,Don't understand all the hate,6,14 August 2016,"I always was annoyed by hates and hypes. My problem with them is that people prejudge a movie and mostly won't watch it without having these opinions at the back of their mind. The result is that many viewers will give in this case bad ratings because they are either too lazy to build themselves an own opinion or just to go with the hate.The hate about ""Ghostbusters"" already started with the announcement of director Paul Feig, who has a small ""hate-base"" with his previous installment ""The Heat"". It even got worse when the first trailer was released on YouTube and storied as the worst trailer on YouTube ever. I agree it wasn't that good, but here I also think that people just disliked it because to be part of the hate. It happened the way it had to and the film was teared up by the viewers. The review titled ""Dead on arrival"" is a prime example for a 1/10 review which just is there because to prove the hate. I don't want to assume every 1/10 reviewer here, that they have no own opinion but at least 50% went with the stream and gave it a bad rating because they didn't even give the movie a chance. My point is that I don't understand the criticism at all.The most known core message of the hate reviews is that the movie is ""man hating"" and racist. So many times before people moaned about that women can't be main characters and that they're just there to be sexy in the background. This movie turned the tables by letting Chris Hemsworth's character be a dumb yet sexy assistant who delivers nothing to the plot. I as a male have to say that his character was hilarious and it was fun to see how men also can be totally useless in movies. I wouldn't call it ""man-hating"" rather sarcastic.Many also criticized the non-discernible story, the forgettable characters, and the non-existent jokes. The story is for me on the same level like the original ""Ghostbusters"". The plot has a pleasant pacing and there is enough space for the main characters to be introduced (except for McKinnon's character). McCarthys' Abby, Wiig's Erin and Jones' Patty will stay longer in my mind because they had a very good on-screen synergy and worked nice as a team and provide together many funny jokes. Some may be a bit too childish (fart jokes and so on) but overall they're fine.Another reason why this movie is hated is the fact that everything is stolen from the predecessors and doesn't give enough new ideas. This is something I'm always curious about. On the one hand, people want to see a whole new movie and that the filmmakers are creative. On the other hand, they don't want that the movies' spirit gets destroyed and that they stay to the roots. ""Ghostbusters"" found a good middle course. They took the setting and idea of a ghost hunting main characters and a ghost invasion with lots of slimes but changed distinctive elements like the gender of certain roles, the look, the main characters properties and the villain. For me, this was an excellent mixture of new and old. The fact that Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd and Sigourney Weaver all have cameos satisfied my ""retrospect-desire"". The point is that you can't have a whole new movie with fresh ideas, whole new story, characters and setting without destroying the old movies' spirit. While reading this you should get where the crux is ...And last but not least many moaned about the horrible CGI and soundtrack. The effect of the movie fit totally to the rest of it and help it to give it more ""old-school-charm"". If a CGI ghost spits real slime out of his mouth it doesn't have to look hyper-realistic, it has to look proper. At some points, you could catch up some bad greenscreen effects but that's not such a big deal like everybody is saying. The soundtrack isn't as unique as the original' was, but like I already said you can't expect a whole new soundtrack and it is still OK.""Ghostbusters"" don't deserve all this hate at all. Question the asininity of the conflict and get behind how dumb the con arguments are. It had a bad trailer and some may not like its jokes, but after all many many viewers obviously didn't give this movie a chance and wanted to join the hate. Don't be one of those fools and get your own opinion and give this movie a try. It had lots of funny moments, the good synergy between the actors, fitting special effects, cool throwbacks to the old movies and has still enough innovation to stand on its own.",Ghostbusters

I feel compelled to write a review because i have actually SEEN the movie and yes I loved ghostbusters as a kid( and still do as an adult). It's up there on my fave all time comedies. I thought it was a good stand alone movie and had a lot of nice homages to the original movie. In no way do I feel it lessened the awesomeness of ghostbusters and why should it??? It was pretty nice to watch a movie with some girl power and i still love the original movie as well. Imagine that! It was enjoyable. Not the best movie ever but it does what it sets out to do; be an enjoyable popcorn movie. Although there are a lot of funny lines I feel Chris Hemsworth stands out and is hilarious! I feel it doesn't deserve the low scores and poor reviews it is getting. I say see it for yourself and form your own opinion but I was pleased.,Ghostbusters

Poor editing, poor script, poor directing, pretty much poor everything.I don't give a hoot who the 4 main leads are (male, female, alien) - There just seemed to be no chemistry between them in this film.As they say in the film..

989,elitevaran,"Worth a rental, at the very least.",5,28 July 2016,"I first noticed this film a while ago when the trailer was shown on Youtube. Currently over 900k dislikes. The dislikes and the comments meant something, and the actual trailer itself was bad. It was a warning, what was soon to come.The film itself tries to cash in all of the humor and ideas from the first, But this film feels like it tried too hard to climb up to the 1984 originals level.Some of the jokes are actually clever, some being crude or movie references. The characters itself are mostly flat, Kristen Wiig is just like her role in bridesmaids, and i find her role similar to Sandra Bullocks role in The Heat, (Another Paul Feig movie) Where Sandra is very formal with her job, Melissa forces her to roll up her sleeves and do dirty work though she is not used to it. In the end she becomes very experienced and Kristen/Sandra form a really strong bond. This works the same way with this film.Its the pure fact that its an average Paul Feig with tiny Ghostbusters aspects and they call it ""Ghostbusters"" annoys me. I would personally enjoy this film more if it had more ""connections"" to the first except reducing the other characters to cameos. Though the cameos are creative, which is nice. Another thing that grinds my gears is the modernized theme song. If they were to keep it how it was, that would be excellent, however they make it sound like every song on the radio these days. But there's ALSO an orchestral remix which is awesome, so why didn't they just settle with that? Did they need BOTH?Overall, I would recommend watching this movie as a rental. A rental like ""Oh that movie wasn't too bad"" And move along with your life the next day.PROS:-Good Cameos -Some Funny moments -Paul's most visually striking film to date -Ghost-Catching Devices are unique and awesomeCONS:-Original Characters are reduced to Cameo's -Movie tries too hard -Bland Characters -Horrible Villain",Ghostbusters
990,patriciamassiwer,Loved it-hilarious!,8,25 January 2017,"These four ladies are hilarious! You have to pay close attention to their dialogue in order to reap the benefits of their comedic skill. If you watch the film while on your phone or doing anything else that pulls your attention from the film, even for a moment, you will completely miss the clever banter. I think that is why some people may have given this film a bad review. There is no reason one would not enjoy this film, as long as you aren't picking apart the story and expecting it to be a masterpiece like Shakespeare. You don't go to a Ghostbusters film for great literary fulfillment. This film was designed to make you laugh and give you a moment of escape and lightheartedness. I believe one could find holes in almost every plot in films and television these days, so give yourself a break, relax and use this film to enjoy some quick wit and fun action. I loved the various nods to the original film as well. Some of the outtakes and extended scenes I have seen that were cut should have been incorporated in the film because these four ladies have incredible comedic chemistry. Maybe if it were edited a little differently, it may have drawn more good reviews. Oh and Chris Hemsworth was a hoot!

991,mfelix-47136,Depicts men as inferior in this movie,1,14 July 2016,"Another stereotypical movie but this time it's also men-bashing movie that is designed to fulfill someone's agenda of men-bashing. It claims to be equal or progressive but it is anything but. The ""man"" in the movie working as a secretary is treated like dirt and is treated like an object, which I am very uncomfortable about. He is belittled and sort of used like a dog and scenes where he is ""hired"" based on his looks sends the wrong message. That is pretty sexist to me in this day and age. Where is equality in that? This is not funny, not progressive and certainly offensive. Why was there a need to degrade male culture? Why??? If you want to be equal, BE equal, not offensive. If it were a female character being treated like an object, such as the case in the new GB movie, except it's a male secretary in the movie, there would have been a backlash. Jokes are not funny, and are forced, this movie is TRYING to be funny, instead of BEING funny. And lastly, what genre does this new reboot movie belong to? I thought the original idea of ghostbusters is more of a sci-fi/horror with some elements of humor. However, the new movie seems to try too hard to be a silly joke after joke...and fails at that. Whether you watch it or not, try for a moment to imagine the scenes where the male secretary is treated like dirt, if it were to be the opposite gender. Would it be OK? The popular media would have been all over it.If they wanted to be equal and all that, they should have employed humor on all genders, without 'targeting' males, in order to prove their true intentions of being equal, progressive and neutral. I think the director has some issues with males/men and probably took something personal to him and reflected it in the movie to show his disrespect towards an entire gender. Basically, to serve his or someone's agenda. What a way to alienate an entire gender from disliking the movie, aside from the movie being crap. If you want to sell/market a movie, don't alienate your customers - should be the lesson learned here!",Ghostbusters

I must say it's quite grating to see that, more than 30 years later, there are still the same issues with the African-American character: the only main character who's not a scientist? Really? Don't the writers know that African-American women are the most-educated group in the USA today? Google it.All in all, it was entertaining. I hope the gigantic manbaby- internet-troll backlash against the film won't make it flop because we need Hollywood to be more willing to put women forward in its big productions. No, it's true, we don't need more reboots and sequels.

Well here is what you do! CREATE YOUR OWN ORIGINAL MOVIE!!!! This is exactly why this movie fails in every attempt. The whole purpose for making this movie was a political statement and a chance to bash the original movie. They kill off the original cast member? They attempt to make (bad) jokes about men (which I don't remember the first Ghostbusters movie bashing women in such a way.) Finally they kill the final (boss) by shooting it in its crotch....Not to mention ripping off just about every scene from the first movie. Not a single creative or funny thought in this movie. I have been to horribly UN-funny movies in the past and heard at least a few people laugh. Not only was my local theater half empty but NO ONE LAUGHED. As for the sexiest outcry by the cast? more than half of the theater was men!! So much for that crap theory.Please don't waste your money or your time.

Yelling? Check. Bitch slapping? Check. Every single stereotype about black woman? Check. Remember Winston Zeddemore from the original film? Was he a stereotypical black man at the time in the 1980s? Nope. Instead, he was an Average Joe who wanted a job and took it at Ghostbusters.

996,sirfran,"An entertaining movie, but not a good movie",4,22 July 2016,"Slight chance of minor spoilers. The spoilers won't give away the movie.This movie was very entertaining. The cast was excellent, Kate McKinnon and Chris Hemsworth were probably the better of the cast even though they all were great. I recommend everyone to see it, not because it is good (which it isn't), but because it is entertaining, something you can turn your brain off, eat some popcorn, have a large Mello Yellow, some Mike n Ike's, and just have fun. Kind of like Adam Sandler movies now-a-days. The movie itself isn't very good, there are parts where you are thinking it is getting better, but after that part, it just falls back into the mediocre movie it is.The film, directed by Paul Fiege (I probably spelled his name wrong, sorry) who directed better films such as Bridesmaids, The Heat, and Spy, has Erin (Wiig) who finds out the book she and Abbey (Mcarthy) wrote years back was actually published, and because she works at a high-end physics university, she cannot actually believe in ghosts basically. She goes to Abbe's office where she and her partner Jillian (McKinnon) are working, Erin asks Abbey to take the book off the market because the book can affect her job, which was because somebody said there was a ghost in a house that is a tourist attraction. They all go, even Erin because Abby promised to take the book of the market if she does. When they encounter a ghost (which throws up on Erin) we see them celebrating, but, Erin's boss finds the video Abby posted and she gets fired, but Erin and Abbery and Jillian form the Ghostbusters, and also gain two other employees. One named Patty (Jones) who helps them get around New York with her Uncle's car. The other named Kevin (Hemsworth) who answer's the phones when people call. They fight ghosts the rest of the movie and then the finale happens then it ends. It is unoriginal how they did it. The best part of the film are the cameos, and there are several. Bill Murray makes a cameo and is seen on the news saying the ghosts the Ghostbusters caught were fake and the second time he shows up, he is with the Ghostbusters talking with them after they caught the greenish dragon from the trailers at an Ozzy Osbournes concert (which he cameos, and, as a rock/metal guy, made me happy), the next came is introduced with a, ""What do you want!"" and is Annie Potts, who is working at a hotel where Slimer is, which is a cool scene for fans of the original. The next cameo is Patty's uncle, played by Earnie Hudson, and the last cameo is Jillian helper, and it is none-other than Sigourney Weaver. The only people that didn't cameo were Dan Aykroyd and Ivan Reitman. Once again, this is a very entertaining movie, but not a very good one. The cameos and the cast are the best parts of the film and all the fan-service will make you smile. It isn't a horrible movie, just not a good movie, but I still think it is worth checking out.

997,charliedoble,The most unfunny and boring film of 2015,2,15 January 2017,"The '84 Ghostbusters is one of the funniest comedies ever put to screen. And d'you know why? Because it featured three of the funniest people of the time: Harold Ramis, Bill Murray and Dan Aykroyd. It's a very important movie to me, and when I saw the trailer for the new movie... I didn't care. Everyone was losing their minds over it, but I just saw it as a completely disposable, unfunny comedy that people would forget about in three minutes. And you know what? I was exactly right.The fact that everyone was saying all the hate generated around the trailer was because there was ""women in it"" is absurd to me. It wasn't the people, it was the JOKES. They were all terribly boring and unfunny. And so was the film, almost every joke fell flat. The great thing about the original Ghostbusters is the great flow it has, in terms of the joke. All of the jokes seem set up and payed off. In this, there's not really a setup to the jokes, or even really a payoff, it's just Melissa McCarthy saying about soup and won tons. Here's the thing. Improvisation is NOT FUNNY. Every time Chris Hemsworth was on screen it was cringe inducing. The CG in the film is laughably bad. It's not a good sign when the effects in the original film which came out in 1984 look better. As for performances, pretty much everyone is bad except, surprisingly, Leslie Jones, considering she was the worst part of the trailer. The villain is laughably bad and the cameos are embarrassing to say the least. Bill Murray phoned it in so hard I was laughing.The humour in the film is as low-brow as it comes and none of the jokes were funny. And therein lies the problem: everyone in the film is trying to be funny. In the original, Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis acted like real SCIENTISTS. Bill Murray was the comic relief. Here, all of them were trying to be the comic relief, and it doesn't work at all. And then at the end it turns into a typical, ""laser-in-the- sky"" type ending with terrible CG galore.Skip this one.

Although it will never be better than the original Ghostbusters (1984), Ghostbusters(2016) isn't a bad movie. I can understand why so many people didn't like it. People didn't want the Ghostbusters franchise (1984) and (1989) to change. I think although it isn't like the first two, Ghostbusters (2016) is a good movie for the next generation to enjoy. I will say though it isn't a film for children under 10. Some of the ghosts can be quite scary and there is some comedic swearing. That doesn't make it a bad film, in fact it makes that little bit funnier and better actually. All four of the Ghostbusters are funny and likable. All of them resemble the older Ghostbusters.

In fact, I was SO disappointed, I signed up to IMDb just to leave a review of how bad this film is! (Don't worry - there are no spoilers). There was nothing original, the humour is non existent, the graphics are awful (REALLY awful), the plot is thin (at best), none of the characters are memorable, the colors are too bright and childish, and I could go on!! How could they mess up a remake so badly? Why remake it at all? There were SO many directions the story could have gone in, but to the detriment of the film, didn't. If like me you enjoyed the original films, then watch them again and avoid this at all costs to save yourself the anguish. I hope the director can one day admit to his mistakes and refer to this film appropriately... It's not a film, it's garbage.",Ghostbusters
1000,vgloveforlife,Better than the original,10,28 November 2016,"I was pleasantly surprised with this Ghostbusters version. I've seen the original a few times and I always wondered what the hype was due to it being boring and drab. This modern new version was a wonderful surprise and so much better! I never would have thought this to be the case due to the low reviews it received. I think that movie reviewers are putting the old Ghostbusters on a pedestal where it doesn't belong. It really wasn't that good. The only good thing about the old one was the theme song and the all-star cast. This new one also has an all-star cast, and quite frankly, it is a refreshing movie of it's time. It's about time we see a group of women together as protagonists doing something important without the sole purpose to look sexy. I can't think of any other movie that fits that qualification, sadly. As a woman, this movie warmed my soul. The characters are engaging and very silly. I laughed numerous times throughout.",Ghostbusters

The argument is that any marketing or publicity is good.I don't care that it's a reboot/remake, whatever. So what if it's an all female cast? Who cares?I went to see this simply because I love watching movies and have seen countless over the years. I deliberately went in with an open mind for a popcorn no brainer movie. If I have to think, fair enough I am capable. Besides some of my favourite movies were box office flops. (The Man From U.N.C.L.E I still watch). Well I started watching this movie and to say its a mess an a waste of effort watching is an understatement. The Special effects on Scooby Doo Monsters Unleashed were better. The plot is silly and the script is just unfunny. Sincerely I was very disappointed. I found that the cast had no chemistry and the acting(?) felt very forced. I actually went straight to HMV after the movie and bought the originals on blu ray for my collection .",Ghostbusters

I blame whatever idiot that came up with the idea to make a reboot of a great movie and as always just by changing the sex or color of the actors and thought that would make it a good movie. Hollywood as a whole has lost it. No fresh ideas so take something that was good and change the sex or race and everything will be OK. But then be shocked beyond belief when everybody hates it.

1004,billyboland,Simply Awful,2,1 July 2018,This movie is just horrendous. I never write reviews on movies but as a massive fan of the original Ghostbusters I feel I have to warn people to avoid this film at all costs. It's billed as a comedy but I didn't laugh once. The acting is terrible i genuinely didn't care about any of the characters. I thought having the best two actresses from Bridesmaids would at least make it watchable. But it really doesn't. What the hell Chris Hemsworth is doing in it I dont know. He must have been very embarrassed watching his shocking performance. Even the noise the car makes is irritating.

There are numerous films that are released that focus only on the male characters but when it's reversed the film is judged really harshly so maybe a lot of the negative reviews are pure sexism - how dare a film treat men the way women often are. I can only vaguely remember seeing the original ghostbusters so I can't really compare the two but this was okay. The audience when I saw it laughed and appeared as though they had enjoyed it as they were leaving the cinema. I did think the movie started a bit slow but Chris Hemsworth was great in his role, I think he is possibly the best part of the movie. Melissa Mcarthy was a lot more subtle in this than she usually is which I know some people will see as a positive thing.Overall it was a dumb and fun film to kill 2 hours.",Ghostbusters

It has it's faults. There's an overuse of CGI, it's badly edited and I felt that more could have been gotten from the script. However, it's fun to watch, quite funny, the chemistry between the principels is good and a sequel wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing.

1025,idave,An Almost Movie that is still overall satisfying,8,4 November 2016,"First of all a response to all the morons who have given this a bad review without seeing it: You actually have to see a movie in order for a review to mean anything. Otherwise all you are doing to revealing an irrational prejudice that does nobody any favors, especially yourself. It reveals more about your character than it does the movie.Now on to the movie. Most bad reviews of this movie are based on one thing: that the title characters have been made women. There is no consideration of whether they are funny women or if the parts as written have been performed well. Much of the bad feelings are based on not wanting memories of the original besmirched by a remake, especially with female leads. Somehow this level of outrage never seems to bubble up to the surface of other, far worse, remakes of popular movies and television shows.So for these people, let's consider a thought experiment. You remember what that is, don't you? - Thought? It involves using your imagination? Remember that? Imagination? Try it. You might like it. If you can have the guts to see this movie (I don't care how. I don't care if you find a way to see it for nothing because that's not the point.) Imagine that the four leads were male and that they pretty much performed exactly as these women did. Would the movie be as bad? Remember, you actually have to see a movie for your opinion to mean anything. So let's say you have a higher opinion of this movie, all else with it being equal. What does that say? It says that your opinion is based on lies that you've told yourself.Now I'll tell you MY opinion of this movie and I actually spent the time to see it.The movie didn't overall blow me away but how could it? It's a reboot. The concept has been done before so it is no longer a surprise. When the original ""Ghostbusters"" came out this type of story with its particular combination of story elements had never been done before (at least not successfully enough to gain popular notice) and when it came out it was a delightful surprise for audiences. The casting was quite strong and made the movie come alive. The casting for this current incarnation is good too but not quite as strong and some of the writing is not quite as strong either, but you can't blame the people playing the parts for this. They've got to work with what they've been given.There are a few weak parts in this movie that revealing I doubt would count as a spoiler.When one of the lead characters is first slimed, there really isn't much of a reaction. There's no ""ooo, this is gross"" kind of a thing that would be funny. Instead one of them launches right into what this stuff is which robs us of the comedy of the thing.After they spot their first ghost it's all a ""hooray, hooray"" kind of a scene in front of you. No sense that there was any really any risk in encountering this phantasm. This scene left me kind of flat.When the ""crazy"" one (I can't remember this Ghostbuster's name - it's the inventor) tosses out all that technical gibberish the other characters just go along with it. There's nobody really who comes across as skeptical and everybody acts as though they know exactly what's being talked about. In other words, there's nobody acting as a representative for the audience.There's lots of CGI in this movie and I think most people will take it for granted since movies have so much of it already in general. It makes the scenes bigger and more spectacular. There might be something lost in the loss of some more intimate scenes where it is just one character confronting just one ghost.There is one great scene that involves Thanksgiving parade balloons but I won't say anything more about that.So, if you can leave your prejudices at the door, you will be in for a satisfying movie - at least as satisfying as the average content coming out of the studios right now, perhaps a little better (comedies have been overall bad these past years). If you are offended because women have been cast for the leads of this movie and your mind can't handle it, by all means stay home and more importantly shut the hell up. You know nothing about this movie because you haven't seen it. Just watch the old one and forget about this one and leave it to those who can appreciate it for what it is.",Ghostbusters

There are still plenty of laugh out loud moments and it is a good film. Just probably not for fans of the original.

I felt my intelligence was being insulted and I also felt insulted because apparently I committed the terrible sin of happening to be a man. It's not that I am thin- skinned, it's just that every single male character is either incredibly stupid or a complete asshole. Not to mention that if four male lead characters are supposedly not for girls, by that same logic four female characters shouldn't be for boys (I don't care about having four female lead characters but certainly this shows that their version of feminism isn't about equality).It seems that the new socially acceptable behavior is to bash men and portray them as stupid pigs. This movie is also racist, as the only black lead character happen to be a cliché of street-smart and no higher formal education, while the rest of the lead characters, who happen to be white women are all geniuses, with their PhD in physics and/or advanced engineering masters.This is a movie in which every single male character is either stupid beyond believe or an asshole and in which the villain is defeated by having his crotch blasted. It's obviously made by men- haters without shame. No pretenses, they are just proud to be sexist and it's sad, taking into account that 30 years ago feminism meant a desire for equality and nowadays, that definition may be kept by dictionaries but in reality this third weave feminism is about hate.The fact that the actresses publicly portrayed anyone that criticized the movie as 45 year old sad sexist that live in their mum's basement didn't help. They are insulting almost 50% of the population and specially the nerd target audiences that are the only reason they had the chance to be in this franchise. They want to force us to like it by trying to shame us with insults and straw-man sexism accusations, that alone would be terrible in and on itself, but the fact the movie is a 2 hour plus man-hating sexist pamphlet makes it specially hurtful, basically because the media and society are buying their version and supposedly they hold the moral high ground.Shame on sony, shame on the the actresses and actors producers and the director, but more than anything, shame on the media that feature any criticism of such a boring hateful movie as a despicable sexist reaction from men.",Ghostbusters

Ghostbusters starring Kristen Wiig, Melissa McCarthy, Kate McKinnon, Leslie Jones, Chris Hemsworth, and directed by Paul Feig. The reboot to the 80's classic tells the story of two scientist who wrote a book about paranormal activity, but then went separate ways. One went the respectable route, Erin played by Kristen Wiig. While the other, Abby, played by Mellissa McCarthy continued to try and prove the existence of Ghosts. Fate brings them together once again when they encounter a Ghost, and then must try to prove what they saw is real. Does this sound similar to the original Ghostbusters? It doesn't because it isn't. The film tells a new story with new characters and does a good job in doing it. The trailers for this movie had me worried. They seemed not to tell an original story and looked to have many of the same beats from the original movie. It looked like they had a library ghost scene. They used the same lines from the first film. They showed the fire station the first team used as a base in the first trailer. What this film actually does is tell a new story with new characters. While it doesn't work perfectly, it is entertaining and stands on its own. I don't understand why the marketing team who promoted this movie decided to try and rely on nostalgia from the original movies to drum up excitement. It backfired in a most spectacular way. There is a fine line with not giving too much story away in trailers and getting people excited to see the movie. They should have relied more on the differences this movie had from the original instead of its similarities. The characters are all new and different from the first cast. Kristen Wiig does a good job in playing the straight laced up tight scientist. She is funny in the film and most of her jokes hit. Mellissa McCarthy does well with her role. Paul Feig seems to always get the best most reigned in performances from McCarthy, and does so again in Ghostbusters. I loved Kate Mckinnon's crazy nut job scientist Holtzman, but she is going to be polarizing. Either you are going to love what she does or hate it. I don't think everything she did worked, but most of it did. I was most worried with Leslie Jones in her role, but she was funny, and wasn't as over the top as she seemed to be in the trailers. I do wish they would have made her some type of scientist. The show stealer for me was Chris Hemsworth who played the receptionist for the new business. He was fantastic. Every joke he had made me laugh. He had great comedic timing. I even liked what they did with him in the third act of the film, but it was one of the only things story wise that stood out in the end of the movie. The story falls apart at the end of the film. The motivations for the main villain are not explored enough to be clear, and the ending feels rushed. There is also major chunks missing from the last part of the movie. It is painfully obvious a major scene or two is missing from the last third of the movie, but there is supposed to be a director's cut of the film. I'm not sure why they would have cut these scenes unless it would have pushed the movie to R status. I would be surprised if what was cut would have pushed that particular barrier. I'm not sure if adding a few of these scene back would have fixed the final part of the movie, but I think it would have helped. I liked the setup the story was going for in the first part of the film, but it goes off the rails at the end. I did however enjoy many of the ghost fight scenes found in the last part of the movie. Holtzman in particular has a fantastic fight and all of the new toys she creates in the film get put to great use. I liked the CG Ghost in the film. Many probably won't, but I thought they looked great, and where used well throughout the movie. The ghost fighting scenes are some of the best parts of the film and this with most of the comedy made Ghostbusters a treat to watch. It is far from a perfect film with the way they tell the story and the constant cameos jammed in the movie. They could have done away with the Bill Murry character and a few others and the movie would have been improved. I get having the cameos, the characters created just don't fit the tone of the film, and they all stand out instead of fit into the movie. This being said I liked the film. It was enjoyable and I could see myself watching it again. I for one never hated the idea of a new Ghostbusters movie. I did wish they would have made it connected to the originals, but I was okay with a reboot. I was just happy to get more Ghostbusters, which is something I had been wanting since the second film was released. Nothing is going to ruin my enjoyment of the first two films. The first is close to perfect, and I still really enjoy the second. So maybe it's not surprising that I enjoyed this one. I think the film is Worth Seeing, and worth seeing multiple times. I know many don't agree, but if you give it a chance I think you can enjoy the new imaging.",Ghostbusters
1041,clarkelly33,Summer movie fun revisited,8,17 July 2016,"I was hoping not to see a remake, and the movie had a fresh story line, characters while maintaining enough of the original with cameos from both original actors and original ghosts. A long movie, but my friends and I didn't even notice. Ignore the ignoramuses, see for yourself & have fun. Mathematically speaking, the queen is far and away the most potent force on the board. Yet there are certain situations in which the lady's subordinates are more deserving of reincarnation. To be sure, under promotion is exceedingly rare in tournament practice.

They rebooted one of the greatest comedies in history and missed out on actually putting a story in it. The only ones who win here were the ones who got paid to do it, everybody who paid to see it lost and lost big. Nothing happened in the entire movie, just one stupid CG buffet after another. This is just typical of today's Hollywood, where there are absolutely no original ideas left, just one rewrite after another, which, by the evidence here, took about an hour to write, and two hours to film, then thousands upon thousands of hours of computer time to actually make the movie. When will they realize that they are actually burning the entire movie model these days, and before you know it, all the actors will be out of work, because instead of making movies 99% CG, they may as well just make them 100%, and just add voices.",Ghostbusters

The villain was well-cast, but the actual character had no depth at all. The cameos all felt forced. All of the significant good guys in the proper ghostbusters films make some sort of appearance (even the late Harold Ramis as a bust), other than Rick Moranis (unless I missed him), but none of them made any real sense to do, other than for the sake of doing them, and Bill Murray and Dan Aykroyd in particular seemed like they had no interest in being there.The ghost effects were good, in my opinion, but the behaviour and physics of the ghosts were also stupid. Basically, the whole film is a poor effort.I hope they don't make a sequel, but if they do, I hope they hire better writers, because the actresses deserve better than the material they had to work with.",Ghostbusters

That was one reason I went to look this new so called incarnation. I don't expect too much, yet some local critics sure it is entertaining. What a payed liars. When movie have run first 30 minutes, I start to wonder what movie those critics look at. 13 years ago I started to value stars in IMDb and there accumulated 1,169 marks so far. I have been life before internet, yet this turkey for movie beat all when racing category of bad taste and production money wrongly spend. It does not earn to call it self as movie. It is statement of some agenda though. Bad one.Main issues: Not funny. I don't say all Ghostbusters should always be funny but this obviously try very hard to look funny all time. They constantly fail. Given you clearly have same original script to use for, how on earth? How this can be turned so bad as way down to depressive? It is only racist, overly feminism extremity. Political statement at most. It make you feel sick. They have missed whole point of Ghostbusters idea. Busted anyone? Even movie logo have ghost busted.To those who praise turkey. Ten points?

I like Kirsten Wiig but throughout she looks like she would rather be anywhere else, Melissa Mcarthy is, well, Melissa Mcarthy, Kate Mckinnon is okay, nothing more and Leslie Jones just looks happy to have been involved.The whole thing is phoned in, the effects suck, the story is clumsy and the jokes...oh the jokes, so, so, so unfunny.The premise behind this movie hangs solely on the female cast, it's like so progressive and stuff, that is if you can avoid the clumsy racial stereotyping of Jones' character. The whole film seems to be a desperate plea from Paul Feig to become feminism's useful idiot. This is the man who made Bridesmaids which is actually quite funny in parts but this is just awful.In conclusion, avoid like the plague, a truly diabolical skid mark on the underpants of cinema.",Ghostbusters

Glad I did not pay to see this movie. for a movie with that big of a budget the special effects sure do stink, the first ghost you see looks like it a PlayStation 1 boss.

The right amount of new while giving the perfect amount of a wink and a nudge to the original with all the original cast showing up. Well except for one. The humor in it is spot on. Some of it is geared towards women, which IMHO is not a problem and is funny as hell. Chris Hemsworth is a brainless beefcake bimbo and it just works even though it's a little over the top. The one thing missing is the subtle jokes. The original had then all over the place. This movie? Not so much. Example. The scene where the boys are in the hotel and zip the maid cart..what the hell are you doing? Sorry, we thought you were someone else. Laughed my ass off. It wasn't a major joke, but adds to the overall movie. There really wasn't much of that in this movie. The thing that feels weird is having modern technology in the movie. It just feels off and it's because the last movie was in the 80's. Referencing the internet, blogs, YouTube in Ghostbusters is just weird because of how old the series is. But also trying to fit the ladies into the mold of the original 4 causes....its difficult to classify. You expect they are going to behave a certain way and don't. Because you think oh that is Egon's character..umm nope. It results in making the movie feel off. And it's not because they are women. Or the movie is bad. Even if they were men the result would be the same. We've lived with the same 4 characters for pretty much a generation. If new characters had come in, in the 90's it wouldn't have been a problem. But after so long of a period Ray, Peter, Egon and Winston ARE THE Ghostbusters. It's what you come to expect. I also suspect after a few viewings these new 'busters will be just fine. It's like a new couch....there is a break in period.",Ghostbusters

Chris Hemsworth has probably been waiting in eager anticipation to play a role like this and he's made the most of it here. Stay tuned for more of his hilarious vamping through the credits. So fun to see cameos of the original cast - clearly giving their blessing to this clever reboot of a classic. Though I noticed what I thought were two editing errors (McKinnon's reaction shots in an alleyway and one other place, seem amiss for the action and were likely poor editing choices), I am still giving this film a 10. First because I love the new casting and second, because so many people have bashed the film BECAUSE women were cast in the leads. And bashing a film for that is just silly.",Ghostbusters

It was funny, had a great cast of women who work well together and know how to be funny, and also, Chris Hemsworth was a great addition to the cast. I would see it again and encourage others to do so! Many bad reviews seems to come from certain types - men, especially white men, which is fine. Their entitlement is nothing new.

1053,GSworldbuilder,"Underwhelming, over-hyped, forgettable",5,22 July 2016,"* * * SPOILERS * * *30 minutes in the movie and I was tired of it already.Anyway, like other reviewers have said, the opening scene was good and promising! The eery score morphs into the old theme song, and for a moment I got into it.But then the rest of the movie happened...Character presentation upon character presentation without any actual development. McKinnon was my favorite; she plays the eccentric Holtzmann, is a little over the top but it fits her. McCarthy delivers her same old schtick, so you know what to expect. Wiig is OK I guess, she didn't really stand out in any way. And Jones's character is just annoying and loud and at times glaringly stereotypical. Her acting was questionable as well; she may be a stand up comedian, but she's no actor. Hemsworth, contrary to what a lot of people seem to think, was not the best thing in this movie for me. He was unfunnily stupid and kind of a jerk. All these characters just come across as poorly drafted caricatures.The writing is... Well, here's an example: At multiple times, the characters are stating the obvious (exposition) while talking to themselves (Erin: ""Abby, you promised you wouldn't publish"". Patty: ""Is he going on the tracks?"") only to show that same thing play out in the very next scene! Just how dumb are audiences according to the writers??The humor is just a pile of questionable low-level jokes, to say the least: the queef joke (of which everyone heard by now, I guess) fell flat, and the soiling joke that just went on and on is worse than getting teeth pulled. I can count the number of times that I chuckled during this movie on one hand. The jokes and lines that did hit home, however, are overshadowed by cringe-worthy awful ones. (Kevin hits a Chinese gong and covers his eyes to protect himself from the loud noise, ""because, you know, we're pointing out here that he's really stupid."" IN WHAT UNIVERSE IS THAT FUNNY??? Oh my....) A really funny moment was Abby testing out the proton pack for the first time. Needless to say, it doesn't go too well and it's done in a great way. Of course followed by more exposition by the other characters OF WHAT WE ARE SEEING ON THE SCREEN FOR OURSELVES.The special effects are certainly not bad, but the ghosts are not even remotely scary. It really is just Scooby-Doo and Casper quality.Conclusion: there's nothing convincing or engaging or memorable about this movie and not because of its female cast; this movie is horrendously written, directed and executed.",Ghostbusters

Sony you have made this film just to get some quick cash using a beloved film and now I hope it fails so very badly as you have really ruined it.I would really like to know why Sony would replace the whole cast of the original with an all female cast then to have a male secretary who happened to be really stupid, well done Sony all you did was ruin Ghostbusters and make a sexist film.

I saw the original in the theater and it was a thrilling experience as a kid. A better idea for cast would have been an all female team joining forces with a senior male team, like passing a mantle type plot. Overall I felt the visual effects were good but the casting and the premise of the movie is just wrong. It felt FORCED FORCED FORCED, and I am a gender equality supporter. It would have been interesting with Paul Rudd, Seth Galifianakis, or other comedic actors (no Adam Sandler types dear god no). The all woman lead was overwhelming and felt exclusive and preachy. Kate McKinnon is just ADORABLE in anything she does and I paid more attention to her than anyone else, except Leslie Jones who I think is great talent.

We had free tickets to Gold Class and this was the only Child Care compatible showing, so we crossed our fingers and prepared for the worst. Maybe poor expectations are why we really enjoyed this film, but let me just break this down further. The movie was silly. So was the original. The ghosts were in general, not scary, nor realistic.

1057,GallifreyianHub,Ghostbusters: An exciting popcorn film.,8,20 July 2016,"Yes, I am being deadly serious for anyone who is reading this in disbelief. Paul Feig's latest project has been slated since the release of it's trailer. It was even slated before then when it was announced it would be lead by a female cast rather the four male formula the original ghostbuster films relied on. However I remained optimistic as the haters slated the newly regenerated franchise. And I am glad I did, the film is honours the original two films in a very different style of comedy and tone. The new Ghostbusters film is very fast paced and does not have any scenes which you can say are boring or should not of featured in the film. Everything feels right, the flow is excellent. It is a very different style from the old films, it has Feig's stamp all over it showing his style of comedy which is of course showcased by his two golden girls Mellisa McCarthy and Kristen Wiig. The structure of the film and the way that the plot has been pieced together makes this version of ghostbusters seem very fresh and original especially with the groups dynamic. Feig's two newbies, Kate McKinnon and Leslie Jones are the two diamonds that shine in th spotlight of this film. Leslie brings brilliant comedy to the movie with her brilliant delivery and her sassy attitude. Kate brings a very different aura to the film that is not seen really in any film franchise, she brings a weird quirky character that the audience loves, with great humour and also can really kick some ass. McKinnon is brilliant and hopefully we will see her in much more after this debut. Also Chris Hemsworth is hilliariously funny as receptionist Kevin, his stupidity in this film really works well and structures some of the funniest scenes in the film. Plus seeing him possessed is even funnier.Even though the reboot has so much new energy and originality that doesn't say that you can't tell that it's related to the old films. I mean all the original ghostbusters are featured within this film. And yes even the late Harold Ramis was represented through a golden statue that featured in one of the first scenes. Bill Murray was given a reasonably humorous role, Dan Aykroyd was given a role which had the line everyone was waiting for and even Ernie Hudson featured in the final scene as a character mentioned throughout the film. Not only that, here was a few familiar ghosts *cough* slimer *cough*. We even seen the ghostbusters receptionist Annie Potts drop by in a scene as (no surprise) a receptionist. But there was definitely a connection to the old films and you couldn't separate this film from them. Basically this film is not what anyone was expecting and it certainly isn't what all the haters are making it out to be. It is an upbeat film that I love, it has a brilliant cast, talented director, strong storyline and it is definitely just as good as or even better than the original.Also anyone who has an issue with the fact that it's an all female cast or it has an African female lead should go pick another franchise to watch because producers and actors from the original ghostbusters has welcomed this film and cast with open arms and is proud of it. So is the original director who's is a producer in this film. If the people who worked tirelessly to bring this work to you originally approve of the reboot then why shouldn't you? Especially if it's got anything to do with not appreciating diversity within the film industry. The all female cast works very well with the storyline and also the overall flow of the film and I would much rather see Wiig, Jones, McCarthy and McKinnon than Tatum, Efron, Johnson and Hart. Also if race has something to do with it then why did you watch this franchise in the first place seeing as we had Ernie Hudson in the first film, that should of stopped this franchise gathering racist scum poisoning their opinion onto our beloved franchise. Leslie Jones is one of the best talents within this film and at points shines brighter than the well experienced Mellisa McCarthy. The slating that has been seen recently towards her his disgusting. Her performance was great and so natural, why give the girl such a hard time? Y'all be jealous that's why.",Ghostbusters

1060,starscream7-568-490333,A Disgraceful Atrocity,2,15 July 2016,"It was hard going to see this film with an open mind, especially since I love the original film and couldn't bear to see it remade. After the film ended, I wasn't disappointed because as it went on I realized just how atrocious it was. Here's why the Ghostbusters remake is a terrible film. The pacing was horrible. McKinnon's character rides up with the hearse they recently attained, and it's suddenly and inexplicably redesigned into the Ecto-1. The team rides through New York in it and emerge from the vehicle wearing their Ghostbusters outfits. The film took a huge jump here and didn't spend any time introducing the suits or the car. The transitions between other scenes are terrible. After ghosts invade New York the film rushes right into the finale. Much of the Ghostbusters' dialogue is them using big scientific words and phrases. It's not bad for the film to do this a few times - let's say three or four - but on at least twenty occasions do they talk about these scientific things that seem to only be stated to make the characters seem smarter. When not used excessively, it definitely shows their intelligence - but it's forced into their dialogue and that makes it worse. The original film's cast makes cameos in the film - Billy Murray actually has a small character who is apparently killed off, and in my mind rightly so because had he agreed to do Ghostbusters 3 this abomination would never have been put to screen. Slimer also appears in the film, and as much as I love him he really served no purpose other than nostalgia. The movie ended with Ernie Hudson's cameo (Sigourney Weaver appears in the credits). Squeezing them in was really painful to watch, it was the final nail in the coffin. All males in the film are stupid, helpless, and rude. It doesn't matter how big the characters are, they are portrayed this way - including the cameos. Chris Hemsworth's character is supposed to be the comic relief and as much as you will laugh at him, ALL his dialogue is nonsensical and humorous to a ridiculous extent. He is the embodiment of the clueless/stupid male stereotype in the film. I couldn't help but laugh because of how stupid they made his character. The black Ghostbuster is a street-smart subway worker who is also racial stereotype. She exorcises a Ghostbuster by slapping them in the face, and also has a line where she says, ""I don't know if that was a 'race thing' or a 'lady thing' ..."". Her character is terribly misused. The film's final battle is horrible and rushed. The Ghostbusters fight a legion of ghosts in Times Square for only three minutes before being faced with the main villain, Rowan, who is now a colossal manifestation of the Ghostbusters logo. The logo manifestation is only in the film for two minutes - I kid you not, it's laughable how quickly he is defeated and also how he is defeated. The Ghostbusters fire proton lasers at Rowan's crotch (take that, males), and he falls into a portal - but not before pulling Abby in with him. There is a pointless scene where Erin jumps into the portal and saves Abby. I gave the film a two for having a great soundtrack, which was composed by Theodore Shapiro. He incorporates the Ghostbusters theme in some stellar ways, and all in all produces a great score that will really catch your attention. Some of the new concepts that worked did give the film some credit, but even so they are very overshadowed by the atrocities that come about through the characters and story. I recommend not seeing this film. It's offensive, badly written, poorly paced and very painful to watch.",Ghostbusters

Some of the reviews mentioned that this film was sexist towards men? Lulz you chaps need to get out more, chill a bit, let the female take charge, maybe discover your inner feminine, breathe, genders not that big a deal, so OK you've cooled your jets and accepted Denzel is a good actor, give the ladies a chance no?

The movie was not the gigantic third wave feminism celebration that some of the loonies claimed it was, but what it was was desperately unfunny. I love, LOVE a good female comedian and there are a couple in this movie so I can only attribute it to horrible writing and directing. Bottom line is this is supposed to be a comedy, and not only did I not laugh or even giggle, I couldn't even be bothered to crack a smile. I found the movie about as funny as Schindler's list, but without any of the emotional impact which made that a good movie.

I loved the original ghost-busters as a kid and when I learned of a female lead remake, I was excited. It seemed like a cool idea. And if executed right, it could have been a great movie. Unfortunately, watching the movie left me disappointed, to say the least. I love Melissa McCarhty. She has made laugh my guts out in previous movies like spy, Tammy, etc. and I always liked her as a person as well. However, in this movie, even her talent in comedy is not enough to save the poor script, the flat, awkward jokes and the unacceptable stereotypes. There were a lot of people bashing this movie for the all-female cast and calling out feminism, and I COMPLETELY DETESTED all these comments. Like I previously said, I loved the female cast idea and I am a woman and a feminist myself. The studio and the cast went a long way to speak against these haters' comments against feminism, but in the end, they have come up with a dozen more racist, sexist clichés themselves. 1. a 4 female leads cast, and -oh, look at that- the three scientists are all white, and the black girl is a laborer from the ghetto....WTF????? STEREOTYPING, RIGHT THERE! 2. don't even get me started on the male depictions in these things. Why is it NOT OK and sexist to put a stupid, useless, blond, female secretary in a movie, whose only job is to be an eye candy, but if you put Hemsworth it's OK, cuz' he's a guy! SEXISM, can refer to both women AND men you know. NOT COOL AT ALL! Don't even get me started on the CGI in this thing. I felt like stepping in ""space jam"". It was 1996 people. It's been literally 20 years. All in all, this movie was mediocre, and that's putting it kindly. Not because of the female cast, but because of all the other BAD things that made it...lame. There's nothing wrong with feminism in the film industry. I mean, there is a talk of a female James Bond and I am psyched!You wanna blame someone? BLAME BAD PRODUCTIONS, NOT FEMINISM. I give it a 4, because I actually liked the cast and was excited to see some old ghost-busters' stuff on screen, but I wouldn't recommend it for cinema viewing. Waste of money.",Ghostbusters

I generally don't like Leslie Jones, but she was good in this movie.Kate Mckinnon plays a hilarious and quirky lab assistant to Melissa McCarthy who play a genuinely funny scientist. Kristin Wiig plays a professor at a college who show her character so brilliantly. Chris Hemsworth plays the good-looking stupid guy so well. This is a much watch for any person that loved the Original Ghostbusters and wants to something funny. It was full excitement all the way through and I had goosebumps throughout the whole movie.

In fact, I think a lot of the silence were the viewers wondering what they just sat through. The rest of that silence was a feeling of remorse for wishing for another Ghostbuster movie. I'm not sure anyone wants another live action Ghostbuster film after this tragedy of a film. You can't unwatch a film.So Hollywood, on behalf of the thousands of 1 star votes, I'm sorry for wanting another Ghostbusters movie. Please don't do that to any other of our favorite film franchises. We've learned out lesson.To those of you out there that haven't seen this film but loved the original, just walk away. Turn off the dvd/bluray player or digital download. This is a kindness that I'm giving to you. Trust the thousands of 1 star votes over the handful of higher ratings.It did have a redeeming quality, the cameos from the original film.

How did that script happen?!?!?This movie had so much potential which has just been completely wasted.It didn't start off too badly despite the main characters just spouting long strings of physics related words that even in sci-fi should exist in the same sentence (It is like the director just said say random words and we will fix it in post - I suspect it was supposed to be funny - it wasn't). For the most part it felt like it was written in sections by people who only had a brief overview of what happened in the other sections.There were some funny bits mostly provided by Leslie Jones. But that didn't make up for the fact they pretty much gave up on any kind of humour half way through.The special effects just ramped up and got tackier through the movie. The effects themselves looked like those used in Batman & Robin (The 1997 version with Arnie and Clooney)!I suppose this is one way to kill off a franchise reboot.

Usually Joe belly laughs at the slightest physical humor - not a peep out of him this time. I did appreciate some of the humor, in particular that of Wiig and McCarthy. McKinnon, I get it that her character was supposed to be an abrasive brilliant geek - she was just a bit too abrasive and came off as annoying more often than not. Jones was actually funnier than the other three leads - maybe she was given better material? Anyway, what made the movie for this older mom was seeing Hemsworth ham it up as the doofus beefcake. He seemed to be having a lot of fun with that role (nice break from being Thor, eh?) Some of the ghosts effects were cool. My son was actually afraid at some points, as most of the ghosts were honestly scary rather than funny-scary.I am glad we went on $5 Tuesday as I'd have been ticked off if I had paid more to see this. I do know my son will want the DVD eventually, so they will make some more money off us. But not running out to buy him a t-shirt or action figure.Edited to add something that is still bugging me - (SPOILER!!!) towards the end of the film, as the Bad Guy turns into a ghost and starts to grow larger - the heroes just stand there and watch him. After blasting ghosts right and left they seem to forget what they are capable of and don't shoot!!!! They run. Sure, there is one blast done that burns the now huge ghost villain's shoulder - but do the Ghostbusters continue to blast him and take him down? No - they run some more and meanwhile he is chasing them and bashing into buildings, too, before they finally use their blasters to take him down. Now, I get it. Blasting the villain at the get-go would have been logical, but then we wouldn't have the Big Final Showdown. But sure makes the 'Busters look stupid.",Ghostbusters

I was thrilled to see a great female leading cast, and a movie that smashes the Bechdel test, even if Erin has a mindless crush on ""Thor.""

To start this out, I have nothing against an all-woman cast; if women can make a great movie, more power to them. But for anybody, male or female, to participate in making this movie, needs to reevaluate their priorities in their profession. Freaks and Geeks was Paul Feig's prime. I literally fell asleep about halfway during the movie, despite it's loud dubstep theme cover and a somewhat attempt of see-through CGI. The only character that received any laughs from the audience were at Mckinnon's character; it was as if she knew she was in a terrible movie and figured she'd make the best of it along with her sellout costars.

Their claims that the new movie is sexist and racist are contradicted by the movie itself, which is neither. Rather, it seems that these haters living in their moms' basements are just saying, ""nyuh-uh, you are!"" when confronted with their blatant misogyny and racism directed toward this movie.

Finally, Melissa McCarthy shows her genuine warmth and humour, perhaps because she is playing opposite Kristen Wiig who can act like no one is watching. Leslie Jones and Kate McKinnon round out the close knit team. Both the paranormal science and ghost busting devices seem quite reasonable and add to the story line. Chris Hemsworth serves as eye candy for the female audience although his ham- fisted awkwardness does nothing but take up time. The publicity surrounding Bill Murray's appearance, one of the original ghostbusters was perhaps more cleverly contrived than meets the eye. I, for one, did not expect to see Sigourney Weaver and was totally clueless to Dan Akyroyd's cameo as the cab driver.

1086,boobah-50476,Better than I expected,8,21 July 2016,"At first there was no way I was going to see Ghostbusters. The trailer didn't really appeal to me and I hadn't seen the original movie. But after I saw that some people had problems that the main characters were female, I knew I HAD to see it. Why? To support intelligent female main characters kids can look up too.And let me tell you, if I were younger I'd look up to these girls. I'd dress up as them for Halloween instead of the typical princess or witch. I'd want to hunt ghosts and be as smart as them, I'm glad they decided to go with an all female cast.What I Liked◾The main characters were amazing. I loved how smart they were, how funny they were and I loved their friendship. For once, I don't think I could really pick a favorite character, they were all great in their own ways. Each of the main four girls had their own personalities, they were nerdy, and awkward, and weird but in a good way. They were someone a girl (or guy!) could look up too and think, ""I want to be like them one day."" Plus it was actually funnier than I thought it would be. ◾Kevin (Chris Hemsworth.) He was SO HILARIOUS! Usually I never laugh in a movie but all of the characters, especially Kevin, where super funny. People thought that the movie was sexist because there wasn't a single smart guy character, so let me just address that for a moment. I know that it's frustrating having no role models to look up too in a movie, how do you think women have felt for years in the movie industry when all there roles are Princesses, love interests, plot devices or mothers? Just let the girls have this movie. One other thing about Ghostbusters, not all of the guy characters were unintelligent. The villain was a smart, socially awkward, lonely guy. So you can't say that all the male characters weren't smart. ◾I think my favorite part of the movie was the final battle. It looked SO SO cool. I think it was incredibly well done and I'd love to go back and see it again. ◾The visual effects in this movie were stunning! I don't care what people say, I loved how the ghosts were saturated in one color, it really helped set the mood.What I Didn't Like◾One thing that made Ghostbusters less appealing to me was the plot, or lack thereof. It wasn't an in-depth story line, but Ghostbusters is supposed to focus more on the humor, with a light-hearted focus on ghost hunting. ◾The trailer didn't really do it justice. When I first saw the trailer for Ghostbusters I was kind of taken back. The trailer made the movie look like it was going to be really stupid, and the character posters with the quotes didn't help. Honestly, the trailer made me not want to see the movie because it portrayed the movie as a low quality, gross, waste of time with lame jokes. The sounds in the trailer made it look weird too Overall◾Ghostbusters was really good! I'm glad I went to go see it, despite what the reviews said and the trailer showed. It had an amazing cast that knew how to make me laugh. With smart main characters and light-hearted ghosts hunting, what more could you want?",Ghostbusters

The plot left little room for the characters to display any depth to their relationship. I would have liked to see a tighter knit group with more history.Instead of a reboot, I would have picked up 20 years later with the ladies being the daughters of the original cast. Having grown up and taken over only to discover a lack of paranormal activity. They still have had enough experience to have improved the technology and add new ghost fighting gadgets, but the lack of business and a dubious competitor has left them irrelevant. Said competitor is a huge McGhostbusters chain with branches in every city. Turns out they are bad somehow and now you got yourself a lot of plot to work with and plenty of opportunity for fun.That said, it was somewhat fun and worth the price of admission but unfortunately very forgettable.",Ghostbusters
1088,Grim9999,Awful - the problems with this film could fill a warehouse,1,13 July 2016,"Don't listen to a lot of the professional critics on this one, I suspect some are happier as their wallets are a little heavier after giving this a 'good' review, while playing it safe to appease the crowds. But their lack of honesty then requires real viewers to be honest in their observations and write about it.Some of the issues with this film: The Characters - They are often too over the top, especially Kate Mckinnon, she becomes very annoying very fast, like a 13 year old trying to be funny. Kristen Wiig plays it less goofy but her issue is she looks like she doesn't want to be here at all. Chris Hemsworth provided a few 'bright' spots but certainly not enough. Leslie Jones was OK when she was not yelling, but she does this too frequently, it feels like a stereotype. The Script/Jokes - Far too many rapid 'jokes', many miss and the standard is low throughout. Too many gross out, immature gags that often are just a cover for a lack of good writing. Excessive Noise, Color - This whole movie is very noisy, ugly and in your face, they didn't say you can get a free headache with the price of your ticket too. Reeks of a Feminazi Message - I love women, but I hate feminazis and the often hateful message they spread. Certain scenes are for sure geared towards this malicious group - such as the shooting the villain in the crotch, castration, to 'save the day', good message for kids there... Runtime - I was checking the time throughout, it is overlong and the pacing is off, too many needlessly long scenes. Overall: The original Ghostbusters (and to an extent the OK Ghostbusters 2) had a subtle humour, this film is the opposite of that. Even if it wasn't a Ghostbusters film it still would be very bad, but to hijack the name of a great franchise to get your movie more popularity, that makes it worse. I was almost tempted to ask for my money back at the cinema afterwards, but then I knew what I was getting into as the trailers were everywhere, so I didn't, I did this to myself.--- So unless you too want to have the same feeling of being robbed after walking out of the cinema, I would highly recommend spending your hard earned money on another movie.",Ghostbusters

1091,matthewcorsillo,Much better than I expected!,10,17 July 2016,"Let me start by being honest: I'd probably actually give this movie about an 8 out of 10, but I'd like to help make up for the disparity in ratings caused by users who are simply trying to push an anti- feminist agenda. Looking through most of these reviews, you'll notice many similarities: ""man-hating,"" ""not funny,"" ""bad CGI,"" ""racist caricature,"" ""ruined childhood."" Let me assure you, this movie is in no way man-hating. There are many more things in contemporary media that are far more in-your- face about their agendas (not that I personally think there's anything wrong with that but Neighbors 2 comes to mind), and ghostbusters is not one of them. The only thing about it that has a so-called agenda is that the leads are female. So what? How many of these reviewers complained when the leads were all male? In that case, is almost every single movie ever not pushing an anti-women agenda, considering the huge difference between male and female protagonists. They did not make jokes at men's expense or talk about any sort of modern gender issues. So they had a dumb man? Do people not realize how much of media contains either no female characters or absolutely terrible portrayals of women? Plus, I found that Chris Hemsworth was hilarious. Comedy is subjective. I can't say whether you'll find this movie funny or not but, based on the trailer, I expected not to find it funny and I was pleasantly surprised. Sure there are some cliché jokes but there were plenty clever and original ones too! Very impressed. Maybe I'm wrong but the CGI seemed pretty obviously cartoony on purpose! If they had been trying to make it realistic, it would have been far worse but they were clearly paying homage to the original movie. Do people expect a realistic version of slimer? I'll admit it was a little over the top at some points but for the most part, entertaining and aesthetically pleasing in my opinion. Patty's character certainly had some stereotypes that need to be overcome. I won't deny that and I'm on the side of those who were disappointed with her character. But she was also much smarter than they first made her appear and many reviewers only bring up this point to make their sexism seem more justified when they really do not care about racism in media. Finally, if this movie's existence ruined your childhood, don't see it. Go watch the original. It hasn't changed at all just because this one came out. Don't spend money, don't leave a review, don't ruin it for the rest of us just because you hate feminism.",Ghostbusters
1092,Blood_Stained_Son_of_Ill_fate,"So much for that Franchise idea, Sony",4,12 July 2016,"The new Ghostbusters is a troubled movie. It can't possibly hold up to the 80s classic, but at the same time it can't possibly be as bad as many predicted (or indeed wanted) it to be. On the plus side, it's no Fant4stic. On the other hand, it's simply not good enough to be above average. Feig gives it a fair shot but only succeeds in showing that he's really not cut out for directing a big blockbuster. If you are in two minds as to see this movie, don't worry you already have. The Entire Plot of the Movie is revealed in the trailers and TV Spots, from the Library opening to the ball blasting climax. Where the original Ghostbusters was filmed, and works, as an actual horror film, this is more Scooby-Doo, played for laughs rather than chills. And that's its main failing. It's played For laughs. The original cast played their characters totally straight. The new cast almost nods and winks through the fourth wall as if to say ""Hey, isn't this funny?""Melissa McCarthy is, once again, Melissa McCarthy, although not as much Melissa McCarthy as her recent disappointing solo outings. Her one joke schtick is already passed its sell by date, and even though she works best under Feig's direction, there's no sign here of her expanding beyond the ""I'm fat and obnoxious"" level of comedy. Kristen Wiig is actually on paper the central character, but her character is so bland she has very little to make her stand out, and is reduced to the straight man for McCarthy and Jones' shouting and slapstick. Kate McKinnon is a comedian/actor I'm unfamiliar with. In the UK we don't get SNL so this was my first take on her. She plays Zany very well. The problem is once it's established she's ""the Zany One"" you know exactly what she's going to do. Leslie Jones' character is by no means the ""token black"", like Ernie Hudson, but her performance is So over the top and cartoony (I almost expected her to scream ""A g g g GHOST! ZOIKS!"" before running away after pedalling her legs in mid-air with a DL-DL-DL-DL sound effect), so obnoxious and so ridiculously, stereotypical ""Shouty Black Woman"" that even a racist would say ""Steady on"". Rounding out the team is Chris Hemsworth, showing once again he can pull off comedy, if in small doses. Although completely over the top, the few genuine laughs I had watching this film was from Thor in Father Dougal mode. However, even this started to wear thin after you realised ""He's dumb"" was the one joke the character served. There's also a nefarious bad guy played by Neal Casey, but his role is so sidelined it's more or less blink and you miss it. Overall the movie is a disjointed mess, with brief glimpses of a good film trying to get out. The library opening works well and is genuinely fun, but the movie drags after that, with a series of flat joyless comedy sketches, that appear to be largely improvised. The climactic battle in Times Square is where Feig's failings as a director come to the fore. He is well out of his depth in a big FX heavy action movie. The battles with the ghosts and the final conflict at the portal are painfully obviously green screen, and the actors' ""Look out! There's nothing there!"" reactions kill any believability, and wrench you right out of the movie. The SFX/cgi by itself isn't really all that bad, it just seems over done and already a little out of date, like you're watching a film from 5 or 10 years ago. In the end the movie falls flat because it simply tries too hard. It tries too hard to be funny, so there's no wit or charm of the original. It even tries too hard at being respectful to the original Ghostbusters, as every reference brings everything to a halt, not letting the film just be it's own thing, and makes you wish you could just see Ghostbusters 3. All the males - ALL - are either idiots or insufferably condescending douchebags, or a mixture of both. So much so that I think this is an insult to female heroes. What kind of message does the movie project? That women can only be capable if the men are total F#wits in comparison? Then In the end the team blast the giant Ghostbusters logo In The Dick! Symbolically emasculating the Ghostbusters. I could only take that as a giant ""F# You!"" to the fans who have criticised this project that Sony studios have beaten to a bloody pulp from the original Ghostbusters 3 concept. As to whether they will be granted this franchise depends on the box office. Personally I can't see this movie being anything other than a moderate success. With a budget of over $140 million it may clear pass this post, but I doubt it will surpass it, justifying a sequel and spin offs. On top of that, the promotion and producers and even some of the cast have already alienated the fans they were relying to flood the cinema seats with nostalgia, and the movie itself does nothing to heal any wounds (one scene even blatantly thumbs its nose at online critics, making this film unique in that it actually acts like a bit of a dick to its intended audience). If you are a 1984 Ghostbusters fan you are going to range from being indifferent to outright hating this movie. If you're an average film goer you'll probably be mildly entertained, a good little laugh, but afterwards totally forget what the fuss was all about with no real outstanding memory, like all of Feig's films.",Ghostbusters
1093,dudleydiva,Ignore the MRA Haters; it's just a very enjoyable film!,8,20 July 2016,"Ghostbusters (2016) has a lot to offer - it's a funny and contemporary reworking of a much-loved comedy classic of the 1980s, the original being a film I saw many times and loved as a teen. The reviews have been puzzling...and the utterly disgusting sexist attacks on the actors of this film unwarranted and horrifying. Quite frankly if all you are thinking as you clutch your pearls and wring your hands while watching a film is ""that character has a vagina!"" then there is something seriously wrong with your perception of reality. Unless the Official Rules for Ghostbusting state that penises are somehow required to operate the required equipment then, you know, gender doesn't matter. This film spoiled your childhood? How exactly does that work retrospectively? Do you frequently travel back in time to your childhood? Okay so we can safely disregard the feeble, whining MRAs who can't fathom a woman in a strong position or lead role. It makes not one jot of difference what gender the Ghostbusters are, as long as the film is entertaining. And this one certainly is!!There's a comfortable sense of familiarity in the premise, with the delightful discovery of these new personalities and their relationships. The cast is more than adept at delivering confident and convincing performances, with standout McKinnon stealing every scene with her quirky yet magnetic energy. I can't wait to see her in more major film roles. McCarthy anchors the film in a surprisingly measured performance. Mind you the last film I saw McCarthy in was Spy, where she dominated every scene in a fabulously OTT story. Similarly Wiig was comfortable in this ensemble performance. Combined with Jones' affable and generous ""Patty"", the four new Ghostbusters are a cohesive and fun team that bring it. Chris Hemsworth is capable in his role as ditzy receptionist, with a > 50% hit rate with his humorous lines, however I couldn't imagine a better film conclusion (and credits) due to Hemsworth's fine performance.Is the film flawless? No. There are some hiccups in pacing here and there, and issues with some character formation and progression. In a way the sheer familiarity we all have with the original combined with the abundant cameos detract from full 'suspension of disbelief' in Ghostbusters 2016. But I expect this would always have been the case in the reworking of such a comedy classic. I must stress the film stands on its own merits, with a solid storyline, great CGI and typically fine direction from Feig. I watched the film with my 15 year old son. Not that it matter much to me, but for some it will be good to know the film is largely free from swearing and sexual content. He has seen the original but also loved this remake. His favourite character was also McKinnon's Holtzmann. My enlightened son also understood the tongue-in-cheek silliness of Hemsworth's character without losing his mind over the objectification (by one Ghostbuster) of the character in this small ditzy role reversal.Overall I rate Ghostbusters (2016) an 8/10. With a bit better pacing in parts, maybe some reworking of script to ensure character consistency throughout the film it would have been the ""perfect"" fun comedy hit. This film had me smiling all the way through it, with some real LOL moments. Go see it!",Ghostbusters
1094,holydiver-91292,I thought it was awesome,8,16 July 2016,"I grew up with Ghostbusters. I even have a Ghostbusters tattoo on my leg. The negative reviews simply aren't true. Go see it. It's funny, and the special effects are great. I felt it payed homage to the originals in great style. Will see again.I can't figure out why all the negative were left. It's like they never actually saw the film and didn't like the fact that women were the main leads. For me: Funny ✔️ FX ✔️ Remembering the past ✔️ I laughed ✔️ Love the new cast ✔️ Will see again ✔️Hope this helps Don't believe my fellow men bashing it.",Ghostbusters
1095,henrydunders,Ghostbusters,4,19 July 2016,"Let me preface this review by stating, that I have IBS. For anyone that doesn't know what IBS is, it stands for irritable bowel syndrome. It is a very serious syndrome that causes the bowels to be, lets just say, extra busy.The new Ghostbusters did nothing but cause my IBS to go into full effect. Full of, in my opinion and fact, accomplished actors, this was a film that took its actors and demolished their acting with a gross misuse of visual effects. There is a grand epidemic today of using visual effects way beyond the means of the film, putting special effects in the dust, in the worst way possible. In my opinion, the older ghost busters was only so lovable because it let the quirky acting shine, along with a good use of special effects.Needless to say, because of my IBS(irritable bowel syndrome) and my malcontent with this movie, I will not be wearing my favorite slacks, anymore.-Henry",Ghostbusters
1096,contact-445,Starts great then falls apart after the first act,1,23 July 2016,"It would have been a smart idea to use female ghost-busters, if it brought something new to this story-verse. Unfortunately it didn't.The movie really starts out great. It completely halts a few times while they deliver the ""comedy"" (the guy soiling his pants and whatnot) but the first ghost in the mansion was very well done, ominous, mysterious and awe-inducing. The fact patty (the black character) is a historian of New York is great and believable, she has a lot of free time in her booth, reads non-fiction books, and it's something her character can bring to the team, that went a long way into making her a believable human being.. at least in the first act. The ghost in the subway was already less well done, basically a recall of the electrocuted brothers in GB2 (I think), but already much less believable and much more of a green screen Scooby-Doo quality.But then.. the receptionist interview scene comes up and the movie goes off the rails. It briefly revives itself when they deploy the ghost trap from the original movie, but the rest is complete nonsense. The socially awkward white bad guy was bullied (of course), works as a hotel clerk but somehow managed to build a device for ghosts to cross dimensions just by reading a book, and didn't find better employment and that's his plan to retaliate at .. everyone I guess. Okay. They just start shooting ghosts instead of capturing them, because the audience is so stupid, they won't notice the inconsistency. The wannabe doc brown deploys guns that shoots proton beams because.. reasons? I can picture an exec sending a memo about that ending with "".. brilliant!"".The third act of the movie is complete, nonsensical garbage and feels VERY, VERY long, much longer than the real-time of 1hr 48 minutes that the movie runs for. Any careful editing that survived in the first two acts is now completely gone as well. Patty devolves into the angry black woman trope by that point. The acting is bad across the board. I didn't think that Chris Hemsworth's character was any better than the rest of the sorry lot, unlike most of the other reviewers. His scenes bring the movie to a complete stop, as much as the terrible cameos that Sony manage to strong-arm or pay off the original cast into doing. Melissa Mc Carthy's delivery is anger-inducing. I thought she was fantastic in The Heat but here she completely is phoning it in. Kristen Wiig is okay, except for a good many scenes where she is supposed to be awkward but ends up just cringe-worthy. McKinnon is BAD. She tries to come across as doc brown, I guess, but fails. The scene where she is success-dancing outside of the mansion, and when she is lip syncing over an 80's song, are both probably the worst two in the movie.The man-hating is strong, absolute, constant, and puzzling. Why would you badly insult half of your potential audience, especially fans of the franchise you wish to reboot, in such an unsubtle way? Do they think female characters need all men to be idiots in order to stand out and succeed? Other movies didn't pull this crap and fared so much better. Rey got help by men and she still kicked ass. Ripley teamed up with Hudson and still kicked ass. Was that really necessary? Overall, this movie is frustrating, it clearly started off in the first 20-30 minutes with all the makings of a good re-energizing of this franchise, with a smart pivot of the main characters, but impotent writing, directing, acting, made sure that we won't get sequels. I'd recommend waiting until it's out on Netflix to watch it while doing something else; definitely not worth going out to the theater for this, or wasting 2 hours of your life.Also, I don't think Sony realize this is really a black mark on their overall brand. I've liked their products since the days of the Walkman, I've owned Wega's, Vaio's, even Xperia phones.. This isn't inspiring me to get anything from them again.",Ghostbusters
1097,ShanleyStone,Slightly surpirised,1,10 January 2017,"I had low hopes for this movie, honestly I thought it was going to be extremely terrible- just a silly parody of a classic. I wasn't even going to watch it in the first place. Although cheesy at times, it was surprisingly comedic and the CG was fairly cool. I liked the colors they used as a scheme, especially the green to signify evil just like the original GB and The Lion King. It also seemed more thought out than I initially assumed it would be.To be honest the trailer looked horrible & cheesy, the cast looked worse and the overall rating spoke for itself. Definitely not as bad as I initially thought. Don't be so critical and harshly throw this movie in the dumpster immediately, give it a chance. It'll never be the classic Ghostbusters (or a favourite movie of mine), but it is definitely a comedic version that doesn't completely shame the Ghost Busters name.",Ghostbusters
1098,armtanker,SEXIST! Travesty to be avoided,1,1 October 2017,"Awful. I love the original Ghostbuster. There was chemistry between all the characters. But this movie is horrible. The 140 million dollars would of been better spent on the homeless that this travesty.The jokes are dull. The acting is dull. The men are mindless dunces, while the women are sexist brainiacs, that objectify the men. The black character is a typical stereotype angry, abrasive and rude. Avoid it. The ghost are all the same green glow. Waste of time watching this on dvr.The story is a rehash of Ghostbusters II, where an evil man wants to bring ghost to destroy and take over New York. I enjoyed dental surgery more than this nonsense.",Ghostbusters
1099,scottyf-33000,Good value.,7,15 October 2016,"I enjoyed this movie. It made me laugh out loud and often. The lady actresses save it & make it. All very funny and good fun. People are harsh and critical but its an enjoyable movie and the cameos are great. Not sure about the CGI spectres but all in all just a fun movie esp for the kiddies. Kristen Wiig's dancing is very sexy and funny. She's much much better as a brunette than blonde. The inclusion of seasoned SNL actresses who work well on-screen is an asset. All in all, it has a good spin for a remake. Good kids movie and one for the family. Everyone will get a laugh. Even dad. Overall tho, it a little thin but its fun.",Ghostbusters
1100,philippsieber,"That was an entertaining and ""juicy"" movie ;D",7,26 November 2016,"Okay. I watched this movie just a day ago. I had massive doubts about this film for several reasons: 1) I watched ""Masterminds"" (2016) just two day ago and again (!) found a bunch of brilliant comedians in an awfully scripted movie which didn't make me laugh out loud for one single time. 2) I am a fan of very moderate, unobtrusive PC. Thus, I feared that this movie would be all about ""women can also kick ass very very much""! This fear was augmented by many of the reviews I found here. 3) I loved both of the old Ghostbusters movies - yes, also the 2nd one, but less - and didn't want one of those groups of childhood heroes to be ruined for me. Well, having watched the movie made me look at the detailed rating statistics - and you should have a glimpse, too, because it is very revealing! So after this short ""review of the reviews"", I want to give you a short real review, without telling too much about the story. In the beginning of the movie we properly get to know the four main characters: Two of them are friends, who always believed in ghosts, but have been ridiculed for it and have become estranged because of this. They are the core of the team and they have a great chemistry. The other two are sidekicks who enrich the team by their own dynamics. Whom I -as a man- also found to be hilarious: Chris Hemsworth as a stupid male secretary! There are some douchebags here claiming the movie was sexist - well, I went to sleep without feeling as a pure object of sexual desire... See for yourselves! The plot itself was straight-forward as in the old Ghostbuster movies: There is some minor villain guy who seeks to unleash an army of ghosts - surprise! I did not expect the plot to be anything else. So there was continuity. Still, the female Ghostbusters live in our modern world, they post ghost-videos on youtube and in the world of this movie the male Ghostbusters never existed - though the old cast appears in mini- roles and cameos (except for Harold Ramis, R.I.P.)! :) Okay let's keep it short: This movie is neither a 1-3 stars nor a 8- 10 stars. I felt very well entertained, I had lots of laughs which I don't want to count and quote for you here. THIS MOVIE IS WORTH WATCHING. As I said: Look at the detailed voters statistics and ignore the people who voted 1 or 10 - then you see that a slight majority of voters lies between 6 and 7 and this is what I am content with. Have fun!",Ghostbusters
1101,pmdiesinger,Huge Disappointment,2,2 December 2016,The original ghostbusters movies were milestones. This movie is just an attempt to make money out of the franchise. There is no love or devotion to the quality of the original scripts or the ideas and inspirations of the original motion pictures. The soundtrack adds no energy to the story;it would have been better to just stick with the original score. The two worst elements of the movie are the story and the really annoying main characters. Story is lacking any originality and completely lives off of the first movies. The characters are so goofy and annoying that it is hard to care about them even if you would like to.I would have preferred they had left the ghostbusters theme untouched.,Ghostbusters
1102,demonite0429,I didn't think it was that horrible.,5,12 October 2016,"OK, so first off, I personally kinda liked it. I know I may very well catch hell for this, but still. It wasn't meant to be the original, it was meant to be something new. To me, I don't find it sexist as many claim. I find it a rather comical movie trying to bring fun back into the original franchise. I am a fan of Kristen Wiig, and Melissa McCarthy (not to mention MANY other actors in there.) Is it a great movie? No. Is it a horrible movie? Not to me. I actually like the CGI bits (although a li'l bright) but the jokes they make that tie into the original Ghostbusters universe I felt were funny. The cameos from the original cast, Slimer, Stay-Puft, Zuul... and I have to admit, when Rowan turned the logo into a bad-ass? I thought it was pretty cool. Take my opinion for what it is, but to me it is a rather enjoyable flick if you are drunk and/or stoned.",Ghostbusters

Why did they reboot Ghostbusters, the studio had the chance to do Ghostbusters 3, but no...they make a unfunny, goofy, crap, waste, garbage movie.

1105,dcdel-24150,Ghostbusters or wallet buster,1,21 March 2017,"I wanted to watch this movie, without the prejudice I had heard about, so I ignored all the negative comments and gave it the respect this franchise had built up from the original. Wow, where to start, well positively, I felt it started brightly, the haunted house theme, sat well with me, but then in came the main characters , I've never seen a film die so quickly, extremely unfunny script, acted by extremely unfunny actors!. Somebody, somewhere looked at this project and signed off at least $200 million, to make this!. Some reports state $500 million had to be made to make this film profitable , after all bills including marketing!. How they managed to get most of the original ghostbusters to have bit parts in this amazes me. It tries painfully hard to be slap stick, but in the efforts to be funny, it seems to have lost all communication with its audience. If it was meant to be a disaster movie then it achieves this, it's the only movie were I hoped the ghouls would win and kill off all the main characters !!. Just to prevent another film!. A big budget film comes with great responsibility, this one is as responsible as a one year old baby.

1106,danielsmith-1,"I'd heard it was going to be terrible, read it was OK, found it was pretty good. On the whole.",7,16 July 2016,"This is not going to be an uncommon comment amongst the reviews but, I have very, very fond memories of the original Ghostbusters films. The first completely blew my 9 year old mind, I became nigh on obsessed with ghosts for about 4 years and it cemented my life long love for Bill Murray. That's comedic love, not sexual may I point out. Ghostbusters II came out, however many years later and, it was good but not quite as good as the first. But, since the original came out in 1984, memories of it have grown fonder, hell, it's achieved legendary status in the minds of some which begs the big, fat question, in the minds of some , ""why would someone remake such a classic. Why?""""And why cast women in the main roles, what are you trying to do to us, Hollywood. The original had men, so this must have men, it won't work with women. Blah blah blah. If Bill Murray's not in it, it's not worth watching. The film hates men. All the male characters are made to look stupid. Yawn yawn, moan, yawn. ""Get over it. I loved the original ghostbusters, you did too, put it to rest. You can still continue to love it, this new one won't spoil it. It won't be the same, but that's because it's a different film.Go along to the cinema, sit your ass down, turn off your resentful 9 year old's mind and just enjoy it for what it is - a funny, mostly well paced, mostly well written piece of fun. Remember fun? It's FUN!.The lead characters all gel very well with each other, timing's good and there's a lot of nice off the wall, improvised bits which add a lot of warmth and a sense of inclusion for the audience.There's tons of little nods to the original films, a bust of Egon Spengler in an early scene and cameos from everyone apart from Rick Moranis (Rick/Rik?) who's' given up acting and couldn't be enticed back even with the offer of nestling up against Signourney Weavers bust.Chris Hemsworth is well cast as the dumb receptionist that, inevitably goes bad because, Ghost stuff. I also liked that, on many occasions the settings and plots more nodded towards the originals than stole from them directly. Bit of a scene that's a bit like the scene in the library. Bit of a scene that's a bit like the scene in the hotel. That is, apart from the Marshmallow Man/Ghostbusters logo merging later in the film. And the fire station. Which has a decent enough joke constructed around it also. Yes, it ain't perfect, yes there's a few bits of humour that fall flat but, it's enjoyable. Don't expect a masterpiece but there's laughs, there's action, there's BILL MURRAY.Go on. Do it. And stay for the end credits. Right to the end.",Ghostbusters

1108,mergirliliana,Depressing and outright offensive,2,13 August 2017,"As a huge fan of the original Ghostbusters I was willing to give this film a go. The advertising for it alone was a buzz kill for me, the whole ""Female centric"" and ""Girl power"" thing was completely unnecessary (Since when does that matter in a film?). I can't complain about the acting, the cast or cinematography they were all fine but it was blatantly agenda ridden. I interpreted all the male characters as either complete idiot buffoons or douchebags whereas the female characters are intelligent and quirky and what not. I have too many issues with this film but i'll only touch on a few. Lets start with the final boss *spoils ahead* the final boss was a personification of the original Ghostbusters logo, when i saw this it made all the ""This film ruined my childhood"" comments make sense. Literally the new Ghostbusters attack the image of the old Ghostbusters, rude much? To partially take down the boss the girls shoot him in the crotch, tell how that doesn't go along with the whole agenda thing. Men often are the focus of the jokes in this film, Chris's character being a big oaf who has the same number of brain cells as people in a monogamous relationship, the takeout delivery boy still manages to be late even when the busters live upstairs. There is no real connection between this ghostbusters and the original except for the name, the image and the concept of catching ghosts. The cameos were brief and understated. There was no passing the mantle to the new buster, the girls just incidentally invent all the same technology and images. I have never deadpanned through an entire film before. It just wasn't funny and i left the film utterly saddened by this failure of a reboot. I'll just stick to the originals.",Ghostbusters
1109,SaltedHam,Review from a normal person,8,10 December 2020,"I remember vaguely watching the original as a child but basically saw this movie fresh minded with no expectations.
I thought it was a pretty great film! I really liked the 4 main actresses and they bounced off each other well. The film was light-hearted and really fun to watch! The cgi was really well done, and actually quite beautiful during the big ending scene.
Personally I think this would've done really well as a TV/streaming series, as we would get to explore more fleshed out characters, the premise of the show definitely allows for it. I hear there's a number 2 movie coming out and I'm looking forward to it.I'm sure if this was a movie wasn't being compared to the original (which has such a big die hard fan base), there wouldn't be so many negative reviews. Unfortunately that's what you've got to expect when revisiting classics.",Ghostbusters

1111,KristineNielsen,Not Real Women - Just Bad Characters,1,19 March 2018,"The movie is shot beautifully and is wellmade in terms of effects, however, the storyline, characters, and acting is terrible. Overall, it seems like the writers tried to pay tribute to the original Ghostbusters and at the same time outdo them. Every single character delivers punchline after punchline and I rarely found myself laughing. The characters do not seem complete or like they could have been real people, instead they are cartoony and just strange.My biggest complaint about the movie, however, is the fact that the leading characters, the women, have been degraded to just that - the fact that they are female. They do not have any distinct personality, goals, or anything that make them stand out. Still, the emphasis on them being ""girls"" is constantly being thrown in your face along with everything being different shades of pink and jokes about how ""stupid"" men are. The roles have been switched and we see a lot of ""stupid"" men, while the women throw around ""big words"" (because they need to seem smart) while trying to save the world. Personally, I think it is great to see women in the leading roles - but I do not like how they are being portrayed. They are so far from being real people and I wanted them to be that; be real people. Not women who are supposed to be ""better than men just because they are"". I do not mind them being a little cartoony at times but there does not seem to be a reason for them being so in the movie. I do not think this movie is empowering women, instead I think it does the opposite, and overall, I think it is a terrible movie that I will not be watching again.",Ghostbusters

1114,iamhondo,Harold Ramis would be happy.,7,9 July 2017,"I hate writing movie reviews. But I have to. This movie is much better than the paltry average user review value.When I watched the movie, I was expecting a ""meh..."" rehash of an old successful script (of a movie I liked) re-purposed to extract a female audience. Sit through the movie, acknowledge the heritage and then go home. But this movie would have made Harold Ramis happy. There's the original movie's wit, sarcasm, and confrontation of the micro- conflicts of life, like wonton soup quality fluctuation. When the movie veers from the easy path of the original movie, they make a funny point: Like the exorbitant cost of the fire house as an office, vs a more humble and affordable headquarters.I almost always like Kate McKinnon and Kristen Wiig. But I'm normally less enthusiastic about Melissa McCarthy and Leslie Jones. So I was just hoping for a C+ team of main characters. Instead the whole team was perfect. Some other reviews complain about Jones' stereotype role. But her character was often the sober voice of reason when the other three were ignoring risk. Jones played a strong, ambitious, reasonable character. (Sounds like some people can't handle that.) McCarthy stepped into her role and projected the determination her character needed for credibility. Other actors who did really well: Cecily Strong and Andy Garcia were very good. Chris Hemsworth was appropriately flighty.There were cameos with a tip of the hat to the original movie. Most of the cameos I caught while watching, but a few I had to notice in the on-line credits. (Free marketing suggestion: ""Cameo Bingo"" cards.) And the many throwbacks to the original movie were done with a wink and/or a nod, often with a snarky twist. I thought it was all very tidy.Is this a guffaw torrent, tears-in-your eyes, wet your pants laughing movie? No. Neither was the first one. Both were funny, clever, innovative, and at the end you were glad you watched. I'm not sure the 2016 movie will spawn the same volume of quotable lines, but we'll see. The movie definitely exceeded my tepid expectations and the actors surprised me in a good way.Now I could take the coward's way out and accuse all the severe 1- star critics of the movie of being immature men who can't handle women being invented, forceful, fearless, and successful. And the that's exactly what I'm going to do. Sorry so many guys have problem a with women as peers or superiors. I'm just guessing that their anti-women attitude will be an increasing self-assigned burden as their life moves forward.",Ghostbusters
1115,carabeara-14061,A 10 to balance out the low?? scores,10,27 May 2019,"When you purposely low ball a score on a movie because you're mad it was a reboot which is as it's marketed, you lose your credibility. If any of these angry reviewers did any research at all, they'd see exactly why it isn't a sequel... Why it doesn't follow the original storylines...Ackroyd wanted a reboot with female ghost busters. That's the point. If you thought it would be a serious movie, look at the actors involved. They are all comedians. The movie is a comedy. It was always going to be a laugh intended goofball of a movie. The original character plots with the busters as scientists and a civilian is still the story arch here. A lot of people are claiming not to be ""-ists"" but when you say you aren't and then go after minorities, you are. As for the people crying about the way the actors looked, grow up. Not everyone is supposed to be built like a model...not even oscar-awarded actors. The technical aspects are point on and the colors are perfect for a scifi movie. Also, I want to rewatch this in 3D because I bet the ghosts are terrifying to watch. All in all, it's a fun movie and I hope women get to reboot and redo all the movies they damn well want. -Proud feminist",Ghostbusters
1116,billca,Very Little Humor in this Remake,2,17 July 2016,I must admit that I had low expectations for this film since I feel the original was very well made. I recall in 1984 how I told people that Bill Murray was hilarious.I saw this with my wife & son and family friends and it was either this or mow that lawn. I should have mowed the lawn.I sat mostly stone faced. Probably the more humorous items were the cameos. Chris Hemsworth was surprisingly pretty funny and he probably had the best material.I think the plot of how the ghosts were showing up was a pretty good idea.There is a small scene after the credits.,Ghostbusters
1117,sensaumer,Excellent Reboot,9,17 July 2016,"Not sure why all the haters are out and I was expecting to be disappointed, but me and my family found this to be a pretty excellent reboot. I loved the originals and found this to be done in the same spirit, not surprising given that Ackroyd was a producer and there were cameos by all the originals (if you include a statue of Ramis) except for Rick Moranis and Annie Potts. And for those people criticizing it as racist or man-hating, it's a comedy...all the characters are exaggerations including Wiig as a stereotypical middle-class, and therefore somewhat clueless and stuck up at the beginning, white academic. And despite any superficialities, all four women end up displaying bravery and loyalty to each other, so get a freakin' life. In summary, Ghostbusters is a fun movie that honors the original while providing a fresh story.",Ghostbusters

The movie itself was flawed, for one they are all comedians, there is not one single person in the main cast that is not constantly trying to make jokes, everything feels like a SNL sketch and it gets annoying fast.
we get like 5 minutes of character development before they start making fun of whatever they see.
you can't have all the main cast being the comedic relief.
so it turns out feeling like a SNL parody of the ghostbusters with some feminism mixed in.",Ghostbusters

Normally I avoid Melissa McCarthy movies. I barely tolerated her in Gilmore Girls, and she's been atrocious in everything else but she's toned it down and I actually enjoyed watching her.
This movie was, surprisingly, scary. The ghosts were well constructed with some callbacks to the original. Loved the appearance of the original stars. The effects were pretty good.
Is this great cinema, in all honesty, no, but not do I think it deserves the low ratings given by immature boys. Also no.

That being said, it was Leslie Jones performance that made me laugh. I could not wait to see her moments on screen. Both Melissa McCarthy and Kristen Wiig lacked feeling in their bickering encounters, they were boring. I did especially like seeing the original Ghostbusters in their cameos, Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Annie Potts, Ernie Hudson, and Sigourney Weaver. I would have liked to have seen Rick Moranis in a cameo. I did like the brief cameo by Ozzy. So much potential not for filled! The special effects were made for 3D, so I can only say I found them so so, I don't watch 3D!",Ghostbusters
1122,beepela,Whoa. So much better than I thought it would be... Fantastic!,10,17 July 2016,"Let me be clear that the original Ghostbusters is my favorite movie of all time. And so when I was angry about the remake (and I was angry about the remake), it has nothing to do with gender, but with the fact that it would be a hard reboot, and not in the continuity of the original films. I was an idiot to worry about a film I had not seen yet. It was fantastic.I spent a good chunk of the movie trying to figure out which new Ghostbuster was supposed to be which old one. Was Kristin Wiig the Egon? Or was Kate McKinnon the Egon? And as it turns out, they aren't the old Ghostbusters. They have created four new, compelling, and unique characters, and I applaud them for it.Was the story similar to the original? Yes. It was supposed to be. It says in the credits ""Based on the movie Ghostbusters, by Harold Ramis."" And the tributes to the original were everywhere. And yet, it was different enough to surprise me and not feel on the one hand like a rip-off, or on the other hand like a random movie with the logo slapped on it for marketing reasons. This was a Ghostbusters film, and it was a new Ghostbusters film, and if you liked the original I can't imagine you not liking this one. The sense of fun and humor is there the whole time.Best of all, as we walked out of the movie my wife turned to me grinning and said ""Wow, I really liked it. Like, I can't remember the last time I liked a movie this much!"" And my daughter, who was also with us, couldn't stop talking about it the whole way home. This movie will create a new generation of fans, and it will please the old ones, if they can just get over themselves enough to allow themselves to enjoy it. Because seriously, this was one of my favorite movies of the past decade. The Ghostbusters are back, baby!",Ghostbusters

Yes they tried to market it by saying all us movie goers were trolls, urrm no we were not, you guys just made a terrible movie. Mr Feig you can't make a movie that only you want to see, you need to make a movie that the audience is excited to see, and that's where the problems was. Feig was so busy telling everyone he was right and we were wrong that Sony also lost sight of what the movie should have been. Well its going to probably cost Sony over $100m+ loss, so Sony by all means keep listening to Mr Feig I'm sure you'll break even in about 40 years, because I'm sure Mr Feig is not going to empty his own bank account to cover your losses and expenses. I still would love to see an decent Ghostbusters reboot with the original cast passing the torch, and Sony should not be put off from that, because I still think in the right hands ( NOT Feig) it will do very well.

1125,laoroserenae,Didn't feel like a Ghostbusters movie,2,18 December 2019,"The movie was horrible, it felt more like an hour long Saturday Night Live skit, that was released in theatres. It was trying way to hard to be funny, and inevitably lead to not be. Plus the ghost in the movie didn't really realistic at all, like slimer looked more like a big glob of jelly. And the movie wasn't even cannon to the original two movies, and u don't mind reboots, but it would be been different if the last ones didn't come out 27 years before this one did. More to the film, they didn't even have the iconic ecto 1 siren in the movie, like how are you gonna take that away. To be fare the movie did have some good scenes with some action in it, but that's also a bit of problem, because the movie felt more like an action movie, rather than a spooky movie with some comedic elements into it! With the story of the movie. It was horrible. It also factors into my reasoning on why it doesn't feel like a Ghostbusters movie, because the plot is just some guy who got bullied his whole life and wants some revenge, but on all of New York?! That's not a good villain for a ""Ghostbusters movie"". Plus the reasoning for the ghost not looking realistic, is because they are being GENERATED! That's not how these movies are, there supposed be natural ghost, and not artificial, and if you gonna use similar proton packs, then I think you should use the same ghost traps as well, and not these huge ones to that. I'm conclusion, this movie is horrible, I would've given it a one star, if not for the good action scenes.

1128,linda_mosh,"Ignore the haters--it's a solid, funny movie! (No spoilers, but to be safe...)",8,29 August 2016,"I went to see the film just a few days before they took it off the movie theaters in my city-- and I was a little bit worried the movie might, in fact, suck as much as the haters who jumped on the hate train said it would. But to my delight, it didn't suck at all!The people in the theater laughed a lot, gasped when they saw a cameo, and seemed to love the action scenes (McKinnon has an awesome action scene). I found the rhythm of the movie to be good; not once did I get bored or felt it went too slow. Editing is solid, audio is great, story is actually very good since they are introducing new generations to the Ghostbusters world, so they take time to explain how some things work (without slowing the movie down). We learn about this world along with the characters, which is great.The characters seemed like real people, with real worries and problems and insecurities as the rest of us. I don't get the Leslie Jones hate, her character isn't as cliché as the trailers made it seem. I did find McCarthy's voice a bit annoying, though. She seems to yell a lot, even when the scene doesn't require it. The antagonist threw me a bit; the acting seemed a bit too much, too exaggerated. His motivations *are* cliché. To me, the character was lacking (too one-dimensional) and a bit disappointing. No better than the first original Ghostbusters movie (though Gozer had style).Hemsworth has good comedic chops. I was not expecting that. His character is a parody of the blonde bimbo ever so popular in many, many movies (I think it also pokes fun at millennials' attitudes towards work). So don't take it too seriously. His character is absurd, after all. But funny. The only thing that I found a bit jarring was near the end, when the antagonist takes a certain form that kinda breaks with the tone of the movie (well, to be honest, other apparitions kinda break with the traditional ghostbusters' ghosts....) They don't seem to fit well with the tone of the movie, but then I remembered the gargoyles of the original first Ghostbuster movie, as well as Gozer, and got over it.There are the typical small problems script-wise and editing-wise, but no more than usual in a movie like this one. Overall, I laughed and gasped happily with the cameos and had a really good time. I left the theater feeling very satisfied with this movie, and happy that new generations have been introduced to Ghostbusters.",Ghostbusters

This entire film is a stereotype, you cannot love these characters, there is no development of these characters. I knew it was down hill at the queef joke and god do I wish I had been wrong. This entire thing has no redeeming aspect. It is an insult to the Ghostbusters name. This is not a Ghostbusters movie it just isn't. This movie could have been great had it actual comedy, comedy similar to the original. The thing was just done wrong and I'm glad the theater I saw this at gave me my money back.

1131,garz,"Solid comedy, mindless fun, just like the original",7,18 July 2016,"As I rule I detest remakes, especially films that I have a connection to. I grew up with Ghostbusters. It was never my favourite, but I enjoyed it. It was SNL comedians and writers coming together for a bigger budget sci-fi comedy. It worked. Ghostbusters 2 was immediately forgettable. It lacked the rawness, the originality, but also the comedic punch of the original. So to remake Ghostbusters, the question is, why? Well remakes make money for one. It sets us in a familiar universe that audiences can understand easily. In this case remaking with the original cast after 2014 is impossible. The great Harold Ramis was the glue that made Ghostbusters work. Plus bringing back older actors to recreate their older roles is a sad display. It sets up for immediate failure. So when the idea of recreating the Ghostbusters world with an female cast, it's immediately an interesting idea. It changes the universe just enough to take the journey again but through the eyes of female characters. I recall seeing one of my favourite plays Glengarry Glenross with an all-female cast because I was intrigued at a familiar subject matter played through the opposite sex. The dynamic totally changes, which is what I find interesting about it. They found four top notch comedians to take the roles which puts it in a good place for success. So with all that I'm not going to deconstruct the film, I'll leave that for other reviewers, all i'll say is that comedies are subjective, you find them funny or you don't. If you don't find it funny then the film won't work for you. But if you do find it funny, then it does, it achieves the entertainment goal you set out when you paid money to see it in the theatre. Sifting through reviews I find a lot of personal biases coming through, which is fine, comedy is subjective, but rating the film 1 out of 10 seems a bit odd to me. These reviews are not actual reviews of the film, they're boring diatribes. So if it helps anyone, my honest opinion of the film is that I found it funny and enjoyable, I'll forget about it in a few weeks, but for now my entertainment has been satiated.",Ghostbusters

So, I went into this reboot with a little trepidation.I was quite pleasantly surprised. Like the original, it had a little bit of set up to do, but similarly it soon delivered with plenty of laughs and fun. From the trailers I thought there might be great slabs of material cut and pasted with a new skin, but the reboot manages to give just enough nods to the original while standing firmly on its own feet.The story was a little tighter than the original; e.g. the supernatural macguffin being more accessible than in the original (""...entire roof cap is made out of a magnesium-tungsten alloy"").The original cast's performance certainly left big shoes to fill, the current actors did a great job in filling them (despite the pre-emptive howls from the bloggertariate). The group dynamic, if not the individual performances, were an improvement on original.If I had one criticism (yes, I know that you Reddit users have about 420,000 more) it is the obviously deleted scene cut for(presumably valid) timing reasons did jar a little.",Ghostbusters
1150,handan,Shame on you Sony and everyone involved in this middle finger to the fans,2,14 July 2016,"I have watched the original Ghostbusters hundreds of times. It's an original, well written, funny classic. This epic mess pisses on the original so badly I don't even know where to begin. I have no issue with the gender swap or even jokes for the X-Factor Generation but I can't quite understand who this movie is for. The story is structurally similar to the original with no new creativity or originality yet it manages to present itself as a poor knock off with terrible writing, gags and special effects. Just think what could have been if they invested the cash into a proper sequel. With the original cast showing up for a pay check and clearly some agreement to praise the movie, Sony should not deserve to profit from this disaster. Harold Ramis will be spinning in his grave. Shame on you Sony.",Ghostbusters

The story was strained, forced, and the writing was so poor it seemed like a 90 something odd minute skit on SNL. It was a parody of the original and had no magic, no feeling, and no passion that captivated audiences with the first two films. All in all it injured the spirit and fun of the first two original Ghostbusters. The direction of this film was filled with careless mishap. The industry ought to be ashamed of itself. At least call it a parody like it really is; a poorly thought out parody of a great franchise. Another useless Hollywood special effects movie that will be forgotten.

That doesn't mean those old guys should be in every subsequent movie on ghosts ever to be made. The innuendos that he and Aykroyd were ""forced"" to appear here are plain silly. I bet they got good money for it. And I like this one too, and see it as a homage to the first one. Not a timeless masterpiece, maybe, but quite good, warmhearted and really funny. Why the persistent comparison? Why the hate?What seems to be happening here with the vile reviews is the usual stuff: Men (i.e. overgrown boys) feeling threatened by women - especially funny women. In the theater where I watched the movie yesterday people were laughing a lot, and heartily. So did I. Maybe the Swedish sense of humor works in strange ways? Maybe we have fewer misogynists compared to, for instance, the USA? Or maybe we just don't find female comedians the most despicable thing on Earth. Horrifying, isn't it?But beware, you whose childhoods were ""ruined"": Some of these days in the future people will laugh their pants off at your absolutely ridiculous reactions to this movie and your obsessive efforts to sink it.

Boo-hoo. Women have been suppressed for thousands of years, and here's a movie with girl power. So suck it up. It was also produced by Ivan Reitman and executive produced by Dan Ackroyd, so it has the imprimatur from the original GHOSTBUSTERS, which I adored, too. Yes, there are a few plot holes. The script's not perfect. But it is about 500 miles above that bloated corpse BATMAN V. SUPERMAN. And yes, we girls do happen to like cute guys, and I had no problem with Chris Hemsworth, who seemed to be thoroughly enjoying himself.Paul Feig is extremely capable at writing chick flicks, such as BRIDESMAIDS and SPY. He knows what women are like when guys aren't around. Sorry that your minuscule sensibilities were offended. This movie is actually a bit tamer than Feig's other films in presenting the feminine viewpoint. It's not high art. The pacing is efficient, the plot development sufficient, the women actors have good chemistry with each other, and the CGI ghosts were lively (the evil balloons were my favorite).

For the love of all that is holy, never make another Ghostbuster movie like this again with the same actors. The over CG effects on everything made the movie seem over exaggerated in a none fun sort of way. This movie destroyed the Ghostbuster series and everyone involved should apologize for it (minus the original cast that showed up throughout the movie). The ghosts themselves were uncalled for not to mention the poor attempt of marshmallow man. Abby's character was not only annoying but truly terrible acting itself. The ending of the movie made 0 sense and was a poor attempt for a resolution to be made between 2 characters.

I remember I also liked the cartoon series but I did not like Ghost Busters 2. I jut say this so you know where I was coming from when I went to see this reboot of Ghost Busters with a female cast and so you know where I am coming from, in this review.I am a feminist and a female but that really has nothing to do with this review. On the surface I really like the idea of a film like this being remade with a female cast of strong female characters. I did not find the characters weak and actually like the actors involved (female and male as well) but I hated this film. I just didn't think it was funny at all, I found the plot stupid and the actors had very little to work with.I also thought the cameos were quite dull, especially Dan Aykroyd and Bill Murray who can usually do no wrong in my eyes. I think they should not have been in this movie at all because they distracted from the film.It's a shame because I wish this movie was good so we could have good female role models in a hugely successful Hollywood film franchise, and so we could see more of this series.

A unique portrait of four original funny characters, taking comedy to a whole new, undiscovered, level. The great director Paul Feig shows no lack in directing skills with this masterful palme d'or deserving motion picture. Ghostbusters 2016 gives you an original insight into a world of fantasy and adventure, few films have done before. A comedy that puts Charlie Chaplin, Woody Allen and Mel Brooks to shame. The fresh new take on the old forgotten original is not only unique in its style and humor, but also the way it gives every single character time to develop a persona. The chemistry between the leading characters is something to admire, a study in creative screen writing. Feig shows once and for all how raw talent and original ideas are essential in the making of a masterpiece. Roger Ebert's thumbs are no longer six feet under.",Ghostbusters
1158,Il_Melandri,Just a forgettable product,3,28 July 2016,"I rarely feel the need to write a review, since there are already plenty to choose from and from better reviewers, but in the case of Ghostbuster 2016 (known also as Ghostbusters In Name Only, GINO) I almost feel compelled.First of all I'm not a fan of the original. I like it, I own the Blu Ray, but I don't hold Ghost Busters to sacred standards. It's just an enjoyable, silly movie worth my time.On with the review now. GINO is not a bad movie, but not good either. Not even mediocre. Simply put it's not a movie, but a series of short comedic sketches tied by the same characters and some semblance of plot. Not for one moment I felt like watching a proper movie, but just an endless series of scenes put together in a hurry and a flurry.The frenzied editing doesn't help because the 'movie' jumps relentlessly from scene to scene without respite and I was left dumbfounded, often wondering what was going on and if it was really that important in the context.On some level this may sound exciting and a synonym of non-stop action, but it's not. There's very little going on in terms of actual plot and what's going on is often boring.I was pleasantly surprised that Melissa McCarthy wasn't foul mouthed as usual, but aside from that I didn't laugh a single time. Not even chuckled or smiled. Maybe it's a cultural thing, since two out of the four leading ladies are stand up comedians known in USA only, I don't know. Anyway McCarthy is not at her best (which can be a good thing), Wiig is simply unfunny (she was the weakest link in every movie I saw her, even Despicable Me), Jones just screams and McKinnon tries too hard to be kooky and to steal the scene. Thor, err, Hemsworth is good, but Kevin is just a bad character, so dumb that your suspension of disbelief is really put to test.The characters are paper thin and never gain depth. By the end of the movie you still don't know anything more than was showed at the beginning, nada, niente, rien. The viewer is told in broad strokes who the four Ghostbusters are and what they do and that's it. No arc, no growth, just one change towards the end that was too little and too late.The cameos are unfunny as well and I don't understand what was so exciting about them. The major part of the old cast comes back in different roles. Big deal.Last but not least, when the credits rolled I was left with a burning question: is this really what people are fighting over on the internet? This is a totally forgettable product (yes, not a movie, a product) that would've totally been ignored if it wasn't for the big words thrown around by 'haters' and 'lovers'. This product is not worth anybody's time and energy, so I'm quite sure that all the fuss was just a clever marketing ploy and the people from both sides were successfully duped.Watch on TV only if you are really curious, otherwise there are better ways to pass time.",Ghostbusters

Many of us have viewed remakes... re-imaginings... of films. I approach these films with in open mind. This newest film pays homage to original, yet allows an updated interpretation that is both entertaining and worthy of your time.

1160,vargstra,Separate journeys VS just playing stupid jokes on each other,1,1 March 2017,"As fan of the original movies it's sad to see the extreme change of direction here. The humor in the original movies were heartfelt and funny, the effects were charming, and I think it even works today, in its way. The effects in this one is more expensive, has more details, but is much more comical, in a bad way. The comedy is about yelling, exaggerated hip hop slang, and fast-paced, waaaay too easy jokes. In the original movies, Ivan Reitman was the real nerd-scientist who outsmarted anyone in any room; Dan Aykroyd was the doomsday historian who really had some fun lines in his movie-fact-based monologues about evil; Bill Murray was a jerk, but he had a journey about improving himself, that made him likable; And Ernie Hudson started out as this ""I don't care about anything as long as I get paid""-guy. This diverse group found something together that created a friendship based on real-felt trust, and they became a good team to hunt ghosts and save people. There was a real journey there. I don't feel the journey on this new one, I really don't.Because... I want the old comedy, not this lightheaded piece of ""refurbished material"" (to use a non-angry term). The original movies were about Individuals having believable comedic and heartfelt separate journeys, while I feel this movie is all about characters playing stupid, fast-paced jokes on each other. All the time.. When there are some hints of emotions in this movie I don't believe in it..So much that I give it a 1. Normally the 1 is reserved, by me, for zero-budget independent movies with actors with incoherent dialogue delivering, and a photo that lacks the technical craft-ship to give us a believable understanding of the surroundings. This one is made by real Hollywood people, but you know what they say:You can't polish a ""refurbished material""!Mic drop",Ghostbusters
1161,darkmane-680-473077,"Nothing Special, unfortunately",6,17 August 2016,"I read the novel first, on a five hour plane flight. The novel was awful... absolutely the worst book I've ever read through.I felt that the author was a good writer. And the first chapter, depicting the haunted tour encounter, that was genuinely good. But the rest of the book was dreck. By page 60 I needed to put it down for an hour. By halfway through I wanted to rip the book in half. But I forced myself through, hoping for a payoff ending that never came.Based on the novel, I was definitely not going to see the movie. But someone I follow and respect greatly on Twitter was all but begging people to see it. Ultimately, I went.The movie did one thing very well.The part that I hated the most was the theme of ""ghost girl"". Erin had a horrible run-in with a recurring ghost as a child, and when she told the kids at school, she got tagged 'ghost girl' and mocked endlessly, particularly by an ""alpha nerd"" stereotype who wouldn't let her live it down. I'm a nerd, and /I/ wanted to punch this kid's lights out. ;) So how did the movie do that right? It's gone. There's no alpha nerd subplot. There's only one scene where the 'ghost girl' backstory comes up, and it's clean and sensible. Three cheers for editing!The second most annoying part of the story is Erin's fear of losing her academic tenure over her ghost history. Not only is it difficult to believe, it is constantly pushed in the reader's face as her sole motivation.The movie did use this subplot, but again, it was downplayed. Kudos again for the cutting room floor.The climatic battle in the book began with a massive dance number involving the NYPD and military forces. This was cut and put over top of the end credits. CONGRATULATIONS EDITOR, that was a brilliant move! Over the end credits, it was actually pretty amusing.So with those things fixed, what's the problem? Unfortunately, the problem was both on the screen and off the screen.On the screen, the problem was that the movie just wasn't very good. I don't understand the complaints over the SFX, because I thought that was fine. But the story just dragged. It couldn't decide when to stand on its own and when to pay homage to the original. When it did pay homage, it wasn't terribly well done. The only parts that I found funny (and I found it so in the novel as well) was Kevin being dim. That should have been offensive (especially in a movie supposedly so sensitive to sexism), but it was funny.So far as the characters went, they were all 'okay'. Patty was definitely better in the novel with a little more understanding of what was going on in her head, but like many I question why she needed to come off a stereotypical 80's street-smart type.It was like a mediocre fan fiction put to film, and that's unfortunate. Like many, I'd have loved a new Ghostbusters that rocked. In the end, I walked out thinking it was okay. It wouldn't land on my shelf but I didn't mind that I'd seen it. It would have been fun with a group of friends and maybe a RiffTrax will do it justice someday. ;) The second and much more unfortunate part was the off-screen drama. Nobody deserved to get beat up over this movie and it's sad that the worst of the internet went after the actresses, but everything got blown way out of proportion. I went to the theater myself feeling like I'd been bullied into going. Nobody who wasn't a troll of some sort cared that the Ghostbusters were female. It sounded cool to me... we were going to have to have a new team anyway. Without Egon I didn't care who they were. ;) But the poor response to the trailers led to an amazing back and forth that only hurt the movie in the long run. I believe they could have done a lot better if they had just shut up before release and not fanned the internet flames into a fury. All the fans would have gone, bad trailer or not.I also have to recognize the review a few below mine that reviews the /reviews/, and notes the people behind them. I looked for myself and all I have to say is that it looks pretty obvious. Shame.Back to the movie, for characters... Kevin was good - well played and not quite overdone. Holtzman was enjoyable to watch, except for the very first crude joke. But once I got to know her more she was easy to forgive for her raw enthusiasm (in addition her weapons, which played poorly in the book, were much more enjoyable on screen). Patty was actually pretty decent beyond the stereotype-enforcement scenes because of the raw energy she put into the character. The others felt kind of flat... particularly the tension between Erin and Abby was only awkward at best. It flowed a lot better once they were past that phase. The much touted cameos -- well, I only recognized Bill Murray, and I thought it funny that they put him in the role of doubter. But his whole character felt called in too, and ultimately didn't have much impact on anything. Aykroyd's cameo actually made me laugh, it was well delivered, I just didn't recognize him at the time.I scored a 6 out of 10 because it was just that overall - just mediocre. Certainly in the judge-for-yourself category.",Ghostbusters

1166,bill738221,Disappointing from start to finish,1,24 October 2016,"So, a bit of background to help establish mindset, when I heard they were making a new Ghostbusters I, like many, was excited. Hearing Paul Fieg was directing had no influence on my excitement, I've enjoyed things he's directed in the past. The the first red flag was raised when he tweeted ""starring funny women"" not because it was women but rather when you have genuinely funny women you tend you use their names for, if nothing else, star power and excitement.Just saying funny women generally means the painfully unfunny Kristen Wiig, the embarrassingly juvenile Melissa McCarthy, and/or the dumbfoundingly bland Maya Rudolph. But I kept my hopes up that maybe, just maybe, he announced that as a ""we've decided on using female leads, we're talking with Tina Fey and Amy Pohler to get some funny women but haven't got them yet"" announcement. Then they announced the leading ladies and, to my dismay, was able to have guessed two of them. But there was still hope i had never herd of Kate mcKinnon, or Leslie Jones before, maybe this movie wouldn't be a total loss. Then I watched and read many reviews, and all but very few gave it essentially the same review, ""the writing was bad, the characters were bad, the jokes were bad, the story was bad. final verdict movie was OK"" with some flimsy reasoning usually ""I liked the actresses"" or ""the action was better than the original"". This concerned me, who can a movie where everything is bad be OK. so I decided to see if it was actually OK.So first things first, the jokes, it is a ""comedy"" after all. A lot of reviewers always say the first joke made is a fart joke. From what I saw, it wasn't there a point before that where Kristen Wig is talking with her boss, and the last line she says to him, is said in an attempt at deadpan humor. It's not funny, originally i gave her the benefit of the doubt and thought ""maybe her naturally speaking voice just sounds like she's trying to force a joke"" but that tone only comes out when shes failing to make jokes in any of her movies. And most of the jokes are like that. The actresses and actors try really hard to be funny but it just doesn't happen and they feel forced. And sometimes there could even be a decent joke but they take it too far and it ruins. Another big one mentioned often is when Chris Hemworth's Kevin hears a loud noise and covers his eyes. Initially they mention to be careful or it'll be loud and Kevin says something to the effect of ""No problem"" and covers his eyes. I thought ""Well it isn't hilarious but its kinda funny he's so dumb he covers his eyes when he's trying to show he can block out sounds"" but then a loud noise is made and he covers his eyes, and it just kills any humor that might've been there. All the jokes are like that, unfunny, forced, and destroy any humor that could've been there. Next the characters, Kristen Wiig and Melissa McCarthy live up to what is expected of them at this point. They aren't Funny. However i do have to mention Melissa McCarthy, while not funny, isn't at her usual level of ""too juvenile for even a Happy Madison film"" style of humor, so kudos there. Leslie Jones character feels like someone said, ""she can't just be there Winston was that character so she can't be it but how can we make here different... I know loud to the point she's annoying her trait will be loud to the point its annoying it works for a lot of kids shows"". Kate McKinnon's Character is summed up as the same guy said ""A lot of kids shows now a days are really weird and random... but not in an amusing way... lets make a character that."" the villain can best be summed up as a guy who is evil. everyone else kinda falls into the they exist but they're only real trait is they're stupid. Story... I understand there were lots of rewrites and what it seems was left is all the scripts put in a blender and then taped together. It doesn't flow, it has a bunch of filler, and it goes nowhere until the credits roll. In the end the movie can be skipped and nothing would be missing from your life. Paul Fieg should had spent less time trying to hamfistedly force an agenda with this travesty of a movie, and instead have focused on making a good movie. funny thing is if he had it would've served his agenda, and ppl would have been happy.",Ghostbusters

I love good horror or action movies with female leading roles like Aliens or Terminator 2 or Annihilation 2018. My favorite games all have strong female characters like Lara Croft. I deeply respect strong female characters in all forms of art.I feel that this movie not only presents the whole genre in bad light but also the female leading role as being absolutely ridiculous and at times disgusting.I look forward to a good future Ghostbusters movie with strong female leading characters, just not one directed by Paul Feig.",Ghostbusters

I sat watching with friends and could here nothing but the light rain outside. We slowly began talking to each other, someone lowered the volume, and then the movie ended.I think Leslie Jones must be one of the most untalented persons ever to appear on screen. Regarding the others, this was just poor execution from start to finish.

1170,phantomworxsinc,A Cartoon Mindless Mess,1,12 July 2016,"First off this film comes off like the people involved are trying to prove something to serve some sort of agenda. Like, ""look, it worked before and we can do it too.""With that being said, that may be the biggest downfall of this movie.If you removed all of the Ghostbusters imagery, no one in their right mind would ever consider this a Ghostbusters movie. This is a generic rehash of the classic formula used as a tool to say ""we can do it too.""It doesn't work. Instead of being all powerful to the female audience, it ends up falling into the abyss of people saying ""I told you so.""I actually saw people in the theater shaking their heads during the movie. It was awful.There were a few laughs here and there but most of those came from young children laughing at the fat flops and fall downs.I was a bit insulted with the movie and it's constant ignorant view on men.The special effects were a cartoon mindless mess. I'm guessing they were targeting this towards young children, but PG-13 states otherwise.If their agenda was to empower women, they failed miserably. If you want to empower women, come up with your own idea instead of living in the shadows of a successful franchise created by men. You are just mocking yourselves at this point.The story lacked greatly, in fact, there really wasn't one. This is just a rehash of what we remember from the 80's.The whole movie comes across like a group a fans are ""playing"" Ghostbuster instead of being one.The cameos were meh. It was cool to see a Ramis statue and Sigourney AFTER the credits rolled, but the cameos played no part in the movie.I walked away learning that Sony used this film as a huge advertising platform. The product placement is just INSANE. The movie plays out like one gigantic commercial for Saturday Night Live. That humor may work well for 3 minutes, but this movie was too long to begin with. Blah.Hemsworth was a saving grace and this is coming from a guy. But even then, he and every other male in the movie were made out to be idiots. God forbid men have feelings too and have every right to call out sexism when we see it.The movie was horrible. This just goes to show you that the powers of the studios and their money can market something intensely in an attempt to make a buck and the product is horrible. It's like they think we are stupid or something.Regret seeing it. Wait for Netflix if you are really that curious, or just check out reviews on YouTube.

1171,OldSchoolfilm84,A Brief Ghostbuster 2016 Review,1,2 August 2016,"First things first, I'm not going to bother comparing this film it to the 1984 version, because NOTHING would've come close to capturing the feel and impact it had on Film goers in 1984. And I think Paul Feig was set up to Fail from the start. That said I don't understand why it's doing so good in theaters (158 million as of today) a few key things that bothered me...1. NONE of the Ghostbusters (save for Patty, in a bad way) had any personality, at all. All of them try to be ""The Funny one"" consistently through out the film. I understand that Paul and that awful team of his, he calls ""writers"", didn't want to succumb to one being the Tech guy, one being the Scientist, etc etc. But that's no excuse, because they all ended up being the same, all cracking jokes and being ""funny"" in every single god forsaken scene.2. All men in the film are treated like morons. There is a scale of character, yes men can be stupid/annoying/misogynist but this movie seems to take pop shots at men in general in a very stupid immature way that doesn't add to anyone being interesting because of it.3. The Fake controversy that followed. Some men on the internet became very outspoken and said VERY inappropriate things about them being woman in Lead roles, which isn't a new thing in film. Women in lead roles? Try Pitch Perfect, Million Dollar Baby, Alien, need I go on?. So now Sony has flipped the marketing to stuff like #BustTheCeiling. The film does not break new ground when it comes to women in film, it's a market gimmick Sony and Paul Feig cooked up when a few *beep* who happen to be men made stupid comments about the all female cast. I'm sorry those guys where man babies, but the core of the film has nothing to do with a feminism movement, they just want you to think it does.4. Overall everyone was in on the ""Joke"" no one took there role seriously, or played it with a straight face. I really don't think there was a solid script, I think everyday Paul came to set rolled the cameras and the 4 main actors just did improv until he said cut, Which can work in films like, Ace Venture, however it did not work here. Jokes fell flat, and since like I said before everyone was trying to be funny consistently which caused the humor to get old real fast, no build up, no pay offs, everything was just flat. Scenes lingered to long (Testing the Proton Packs) and while I occasionally giggled at some of Kristen Wigs Dry line delivery (which worked because it was subtle), the rest was just awful. Comedy can be a hard thing to pull off, I personally don't blame the cast, even though I feel Elizabeth Banks is funnier than all these woman combined. I blame bad writing and a complete lack Of direction by Feig.So that said, it looks like the majority of the USA thought the movie was ""Great"" Funny"" or my favorite quote ""Can't wait to see a sequel"" I'm not sure what America is smoking, but I want some.",Ghostbusters

I don't know how smart people could actually think any of this movie was remotely funny. Here is the only example you need that sums up the whole film. Near the beginning there is a scene where ever thing is quiet as you don't know what is happening. Then you hear someone eating potato chips. Character played by Kristen Wiig says ""stop eating those chips"" and Kate KcKinnon replies ""you try to stop eating these delicious salty snacks"". Really? Sad to say that is probably the funniest line in the movie. The attempt to make Chris Hemsworth funny might even be worse.. ""We noticed you don't have lenses in your glasses"". ""They kept getting dirty and this solved the problem"".. And then every time there is a loud noise he rubs his eyes and says ""that hurts""... Not as bad as your lines do.Even a brief appearance by Bill Murray and Ozzie can not save this film. The rejection of this film had nothing to do an all woman cast - it had everything to do with this being one of the worst films ever.",Ghostbusters

There were people in every row, different ages, too. Everyone stayed until the end, and there was a lot of laughing. Although we had seen all previous Ghostbusters movies, you didn't have to to enjoy it. We cracked up regularly, and thoroughly enjoyed the references to the previous movies. The men in my family were not offended by the presence of new, and female, actors in previously male roles, or a male receptionist. Did it deserve a 10? Maybe not, but it sure didn't deserve all those ones, and a lot of those I do not believe ever saw the movie. It was a very enjoyable way to spend evening, and my men gave it a 9.5 to a 10 because they laughed so much, and loved the choice of actors for the characters. My son mentioned he had friends who saw the movie and absolutely loved it. The ones who talked it diwn never saw it, and were very negative about messing with past success. The people who are ao reverent about Bill M's irreverence are missing the point! By the way, we stayed all through the credits to the little foreshadowing and flashback prequel at the end. Would love to see another. These women rock, and I think they would only be better in the next.

People who are acting like that are just being weird trolls and have nothing better to think about.This movie is funny and it makes fun of itself by taking elements of the original but putting their own spin. I'm pissed people took this movie which is a comedy and made it some weird political agenda. It's abour freaking ghosts and they cook people who believe in them and fight them for people who think them crazy; that's it. If you read more into it, than your looking for stuff to not-pick on.I'm also pissed there won't be a sequel because I think the second one would have really been awesome since they were going to bring in Zuel, but I guess now we'll never know.

It was a good movie with cool special effects and great humor. By the end, I personally considered it a comedy film.My favorite actress was Leslie Jones. A great comedienne throughout. Her best line was in the scene with all the frozen dancing policemen standing in the square, when she said, ""Why y'all doin' 'nat?""Anyway, if you're an angry misogynist, then you can just stick to your beloved little feel-good videos on YouTube and waste your boring life away.

I feel sorry for the actresses in this picture, as they seem to be stuck playing the same roles in every film.One thing that really annoyed me was the fact that people were saying ""this film is for the kids, not the old fans."" BUT this film contained swearing (verbal and finger signs), clear edgy flirting between characters which wasn't appropriate for children's, and a series on cameos from the original cast and characters. That's a film make more for adults, surely?The computer graphics were cheesy, and bad. The 1980's Ghostbusters effects look more realistic in comparison. Which is sad, as those have now badly dated. Overall, I feel like this film is so closely compatible to the Scooby Doo live action film, that I feel sad for the production company. The CGI looks dated on the release, the story is lacking, the ""humor"" is tired recycled garbage, and the actresses/actors are typecast.

The little jokes peppering the dialogue didn't try too hard, as a remake (or any movie these days) often does. No cheap gags for disconnected, thrown-in jokes or cultural references (unless you count the cameos by several actors from the original - that's my only spoiler by the way).As for kids, it doesn't push the PG-13 rating very far. A few naughty words and a little scary stuff for younger kids is all there is. It was almost PG - in fact, I bet they threw in a few words to get the PG-13 rating just so teens wouldn't reject it as too soft.Overall, a coherent, steady comedy/summer fun movie with laughs from character situations and not cheap gags.

I have to admit watching the old Ghostbusters Films now they seem more like B Movies but they were still kind of more charming and scary in their way and the guys were more relatable at least to me. Not because the new Team is all female but they just had it too easy in this one. They went through all that Millions of ghosts like terminators with no weakness and that made me never realy worry about them cause they gonna make it anyway.

1191,savant1974-656-919884,"Not great, but not as bad as some claim",7,22 July 2016,"I can't help but feel most of the negative reviews come from people who adore the original 1984 movie and are comparing them each step of the way. This is only to be expected, given the classic nature of the original, but reinforced by the original cast cameos sprinkled throughout. Good scenes, but invited comparison. If this film could have been allowed to stand on its own merits (impossible, I know), it might have fared better. I did my best to simply enjoy the film for what it is without comparing every scene.It's not uncommon for 'hero team' films like this to portray just about everyone they deal with as ignorant or mean, obstructions to be overcome and it's no different here. ""The only sane ones in a world gone mad!"" The original certainly did that (Walter Peck, anyone? The owner of the Sedgewick Hotel?) and I suspect some have mistaken this as man-bashing since the primary cast is made up of women. It seems to come down to 'this was man-territory and you're taking it from us! grr!' but it's just not warranted. There's quite a few good male performances, Charles Dance of course is always classy, plus a few other minor roles. It's fine.I enjoyed the flow of this style of comedy (only one fart joke even!) The directing style is... interesting, but I didn't have trouble following the story. Didn't really care for the CGI style and it was overused a lot towards the end. Definitely more of an action movie style than the original (there's that comparison again, ugh). I feel a lot of decisions were made around the idea of keeping the franchise going for a while, since those 'expanded universe' things the cool kids are talking about are all the rage these days. Standouts - Kate McKinnon is amazing from the very first instant she appears in the film, I love her delivery and quirky energy, that lady's got talent. I'm not a huge fan of Melissa McCarthy's work but she was quite restrained and entertaining in this, as was Leslie Jones - I hadn't expected to like either of them in this film but I loved all four main characters. I feared Kristen Wiig would have been wasted playing a buttoned-down lady of science but she found a way to do subtle comedy at every opportunity. Oh and I almost forgot, the manner in which the heroes dispatch the big-bad at the end has been a spot of some controversy, back to the man-hating thing again I'm afraid. I will say that: a) It was right in front of them - even if the cast had been male, it would have been (tactically speaking) the right spot to go for. b) Women are taught in self-defense classes to go for the man's crotch as it's a good way of disabling a larger, stronger opponent, very relevant in this instance. c) A bad guy getting hit in the groin is funny no matter who's doing it. Overall I enjoyed the film and laughed often (though rarely loudly) and didn't mind this remake at all, even if I think Hollywood should be creating more original products instead of rebooting everything in sight, for I couldn't help but think ""this is cute, but I really think I've seen it before' for the most part.

1207,ProfessorChaos74,Don't believe the hype - Give it a shot,6,23 July 2016,"Allow me to preface this review by stating that I have always been a fan of the original movie (part 2 was only 'Okay' in my opinion, as opposed to the first film), and I've heard all of the same criticisms of the newest film in the franchise that many of you have. Despite the naysayers, I sat down to watch it in order to see for myself how bad the movie really is, and here is my take on it:The Cast - Melissa McCarthy plays Melissa McCarthy, accept with glasses, and a pseudo-knowledge of the 'other realm' as attained by someone who's been looking for ghosts all of her life. She's the Dan Aykroyd of the film, and other than the standard (if slightly toned down) McCarthy-esque sarcastic humor, she does a decent job in the role.Kristen Wiig - As the (sort of) Peter Venkman, Kristen Wiig fails as a female version of Bill Murray, yet her character is not unlikable; in fact, she's quite likable as the nerdy, romantic scholar.Kate McKinnon - As Jillian Holtzmann (the Egon of this incarnation), she was my favorite character, and played the slightly insane, sort of steampunk-ish mad scientist with a heart. Her character's gags in the film were handled the best as far as I'm concerned.Leslie Jones - As the Winston Zeddmore sans testicles of the film, Leslie did decent job of portraying the streetwise non scientist of the group, and had a few chuckle-worthy one liners as well. Her character (in my opinion) had a much more central role than Ernie Hudson did in the original film, and didn't drop the ball.Chris Hemsworth - played Kevin, an incredibly dim-witted model/wannabe actor, secretary, who was clearly hired by the Ghostbusters as eye candy, and he brought a ridiculousness to the role that was actually enjoyable.The Story - The story was standard Ghostbuster fare, if not a little darker with regard to the spectres themselves. It shadowed the original film pretty closely, and other than feeling a little rushed, it wasn't terrible.Cameos - There were several cameos from members of the original cast, and they were true cameos in the sense that they do nothing to overshadow the current cast members in the film. All in all, they were fun to see, without getting in the way.In closing, this film doesn't come close to deserving the ire of fans of the franchise; it really wasn't that bad. Was it a masterpiece of film making? No, but neither was the original, and it certainly isn't the worst film of the year. If you want to watch a film for the simple enjoyment of it, give the new Ghostbusters a shot. I was expecting something horrific, and was pleasantly surprised to find the film more than just watchable.",Ghostbusters
1208,niles-calder,Better than the original,10,16 July 2016,"Don't get me wrong I love the original. It was one of the favorite movies of my childhood. But the plot never really made much sense and the main villain doesn't show up until the final few scenes.This new film is so much better. It makes sense. The plot hangs together better and everything just works. It's genuinely scary in places, rather than the handful of jump scares from the original. The casting is brilliant, the performances are brilliant. The cameos from the cast of and nods to the original film are brilliant. Even the CGI laden final act works. If something like that were to happen for real and not look like that then I would be both surprised and disappointed.There isn't a bum note for the entire movie. I can't even think of a way it could have been made better.This isn't a remake, it's not even a reboot. It's taking the basic concept of the original and going in another direction. A different direction that I'm interested in seeing.I'm already chomping at the bit to see any sequel they make.",Ghostbusters

I saw lots of bad things written about it, lots of men my age were vehemently opposed to it even existing. I see a lot of the reviews on this page and I just think they're wrong. This movie was fun. I enjoyed it very much. It made me feel excited about Ghostbusters like when I was a kid. I loved the original films, and I remember skipping Boy Scouts just so I wouldn't miss the cartoon back in the '80s. I had the toys. But this didn't ruin anything about my childhood. It took me back. It doesn't matter that it's women or men, I want to watch a fun movie about Ghostbusters, and that's what this is. Kate McKinnon is awesome, and Chris Hemswoth is hilarious. There was a real missed opportunity with Leslie Jones, I thought she should have been a scientist and maybe someone else could be the MTA worker and it would have worked better. I can't wait to watch it again, though.",Ghostbusters

The effects were fine, and acting as well. It does not deserve all those 1 star reviews. (Why do you have to write 5 lines to submit, stupid, less is more!

1212,dirtsmash,I grew up with the original Ghostbusters.,10,29 July 2016,"I love this movie. I'm not hot for movies just because they are remade with women, or purely women-centric movies. For example, I have never finished Wonderwoman in one sitting, always falling asleep at the age old gimmick of an out of time character in adjustment, or Captain Marvel, an otherworldly woman adjusting to being on Earth. I don't have anything against those types of movies, they just left too much to be desired. Where pacing and character building and chemistry failed those aforementioned, it thrived here. The jokes are still funny after many watches, the chemistry is palpable, and the storyline makes sense and is so enjoyable. The only contrived feeling I get is from the original Ghostbusters cameos, which feel hammy and inauthentic. This movie is in my top favorites list, not because it is pro women, but in it's hilarious depiction of new friends committed to studying the unknown, and the unique laughable individuality of each character and amazing writing behind them.",Ghostbusters

And above all, it wouldn't stand on his own feet if it was the first of the series...The characters are caricatures, their teaming is inconsistent, the CGI is not groundbreaking, the humor seems to be based on farts, ejaculating green stuff, showing how stupid, coward or callous men are, or making various sex allusions, from being wet with green goo in privates parts to castrating bad guys with ray guns.Wow.There is obviously a strong feminist undertone in the whole thing.

Theaters nowadays are playing the sound a bit too loud (maybe they think the louder the better). The original movie was plain fun and so was this one. There is no ""man hating"" as I have read in some reviews. This is a fun summer film that does not try to be anything more. The special effects have come a long way so ...more ghosts. Love the cameos by all the living players from the first movie. Love the way they brought back Slimer as well. The four main characters were all hilarious, believable and they had great chemistry together. Just plain fun so lighten up people.",Ghostbusters
1218,amaskedman,Decent comedy - barely avoids disaster porn cliché,7,25 July 2016,"The movie was entertaining. While I can quote some lines of the original, I cannot remember anything special about the remake. I do remember the first jokes are shockingly bad, so bad I groaned. There was a certain campiness to the ghost that seemed in contrast to the Ghostbusters themselves. The action scenes seemed a little to polished and extensive for women who were just given their equipment (invented and created overnight), and no one told not to cross the streams.The end barely avoided the disaster porn pitfall, and I have feeling was cut extensively.The original GhostBusters cast all had parts, but they seemed forced, and more of an afterthought. The two surprising standouts were Kate McKinnon and Neil Casey, who really nailed their parts and stole every scene they were in. McKinnons character is bordering on being, yet another, Mary Sue.Overall, its was an entertaining entry, only marred by some unrealistic action scenes and forced cameos.",Ghostbusters
1219,deadrock-20572,Great movie,8,20 July 2016,"When I first heard about this movie even being made I had some apprehension to see this movie. This was before the trailer was released, once the trailer was released and watched it I got a sense of what the film was going to be and I realized that I should give it a chance once it was released. I saw it yesterday and I honestly cannot see why so many people were mad about this film before it was even released. In my honest opinion this reboot is worthy of being up there with the original 1984 film. People complained about the special effects, I thought they looked good for the film. Ghosts looked pretty good and the cast was amazing. Honestly the only gripes I have with the film is the awkward flirting Kristen Wiig's character towards Chris Hemsworth's character. It was funny at first but it kind of got stale after the 20th time it happened. But it's minor so I can over look that, the climax of the film I thought was amazing when they get taken back to what looks like late 70's New York City. All in all, this was a great film and well worth it. Not many films I would go back and see when they are still in the theaters but I will go back to see this in the theaters. Before you actually pass judgement on it, actually go see the movie before writing if off as a terrible reboot like so many did before the film was released.",Ghostbusters
1220,smoothcriminal98,it wasn't awful...!!,7,19 July 2016,"I went to see Ghostbusters in IMAX 3D. First, let me start off by saying that the 3D in this movie was the best i've ever seen in a movie.... by a landslide. Second, although the storyline had many plot holes and the characters were upsetting to watch at times, it did keep you entertained throughout the movie. Kristen Wiig and Melissa McCarthy's characters had great chemistry to work with. Kate McKinnon and Leslie Jones were both the heart and soul of the movie that kept the comedy and people laughing. Chris Hemsworth.... had no purpose whatsoever to be in that movie besides the fact that they needed to draw teenagers ages 13 to 18 to see a movie that was a reboot. Although it didn't match the original Ghostbusters at all, it did a good job of entertaining the audience and keeping them on their toes both with the plot and wanting more laughter.

1223,andysparks,What did I just watch?,2,19 July 2016,"I gave this movie a rating of 2 because that's how many times I slightly chuckled, and also how many times I considered walking out. I'm a huge fan of the original franchise. As a kid, I watched the movies so many times I could quote every sentence. I consider them movie masterpieces, and always kept out a hope for a 3rd movie. When I heard that a 3rd movie was being made, I was ecstatic. I became a little less ecstatic when I heard it was going to be a reboot instead of a continuance of the original storyline. But I still kept an open mind. Even when I heard that it was going in a different direction with an all female cast, I still kept an open mind. And I'll be honest, when I heard that it was gonna star Kristen Wiig, Melissa McCarthy, and two very funny SNL cast members, I gained some excitement because I am a fan of their work and I find a lot of it pretty funny. But this movie just stepped on the throat of not only their comedy, but of the Ghostbusters franchise completely. Here's the great thing about the original movie: It was a story driven movie with a great storyline and the comedy just came with the great acting so it felt very real. The movie focused on the actual science fiction side and the phenomenon of catching ghosts, and we saw the Ghostbusters rise into stardom as they swept the city of New York with their services. There was progression and a mystique about the overall main villain. This reboot did exactly none of that. They tried to force a joke down the throat of the audience every single second, and all but a couple of the jokes fell completely flat. The characters were shallow, and I won't even expand on how bad the character that Chris Hemsworth played was. The main villain was not in the least bit threatening, mostly because there was no explanation about him. He was just a bullied guy who wanted to get back at society for some unknown reason. And the continuity of this movie is just awful. One second they can catch ghosts, the next second they just ""kill"" them or turn them into slime. And that's just the tip of the iceberg. We see them catch one ghost, and suddenly that just makes them as big and famous as the original team in the first movie. The only thing that kept me in my seat was the cameos of the original cast. And the new theme song is just bad. No other way to put it. Overall, I don't blame the actors because as I said, they've done good work before and it felt as though they were being limited to do just what was being told to them in this film. At some points, it felt even as though they were reading straight from a script. I blame the writers for this one. If you're a fan of the original franchise, just do yourself a favor and skip out on this one.",Ghostbusters
1224,pinavinada,Representation Matters,10,31 January 2017,"I'd like to start this with one important statement: Representation matters. I don't care if some of you dislike this review but I since I can, I'm gonna say what I want to. I hope I didn't offend anyone in this.I really don't understand why some people are whining about this film, before they even watch it. Especially those who said it's ruining the original – or worse, their childhood. By all means, I'm quite sure Paul Feig, Katie Dippold and the four ladies didn't mean it like that. Like Kate McKinnon, I was born the same year the first film came out. Thus when I was a kid, Ghostbusters is a very well- known brand name. There were people already cosplaying as Ghostbuster. The theme song, Ecto- 1, the firehouse replica, you name it and we, even though we're quite faraway in Southeast Asia, got 'em all.Basically, when you talk about films, there's this sense that every single time they reboot something we're like, ""Nothing beats the original."" I love films. I give every single one a chance. I probably did it too few times, but I have never been so bitter about reboot versions. They're people's hard work. If you don't like it then don't, but there's no need to be so rude about it. There's no need to attack people in it, especially when they are from particular gender, race, religion, etc. With that, I'd like to note the four leading ladies are talented. You must admit there's chemistry between Kate McKinnon, Kristen Wiig, Melissa McCarthy, and Leslie Jones. They work as a team, fit together like the original four guys. Don't tell me you did not see the way Kate steals every scene she's in. Holtzmann didn't have much to say but you can't take her eyes off of her and silly gestures she did. Don't tell me you did not see Kristen's emotion. She made Erin the most conflicting character, so complex you want to explore her more, want to see deeper. Don't tell me you did not see how Melissa is very passionate. We are basically feeling what Abby feels, to the point we'd like to yell with her. And please don't tell me you did not see the lightness Leslie brought. Patty is more than additional member, she's the beacon and the map and the voice of reasons.Overall, I'd like to say that despite your hate, there are people (like me) who love it. I'd like us all to get along and respect each other's opinion. It's okay to like it, it's quite fine to hate it. But we ladies would like to see ladies as leading heroes that doesn't have to be sexy or seducing. I don't know what you see but I see a plus size, a queer, an anxiety-ridden social awkward, and a woman of color kicking arse. I feel represented. There are so many little girls out there feel represented. This isn't some feminist agenda to make you all forget the original one just because there are men in it. It's simply important and I am sorry some of you don't feel that way.I'm sorry for writing such a long review. Thanks a lot, if you're reading this.",Ghostbusters

I won't drone on, as the issues I had with this film will have been expanded on by other reviews, but in essence, the narrative is not cohesive, the editing is flat and results in a plodding film completely lacking in any tension or comic timing, the script was a series of laboured one liners and ad libs that don't land.The villain is woefully underdeveloped, and everyone who suggested that Leslie Jones' character is a stereotyped caricature of black women was right.While I would not say this film is man hating, I was not comfortable watching the main male character being constantly sexually harassed by one of the female ghostbusters for laughs. Not cool at all.The appearance of some of the original cast members only reminded me of how poor this remake is.The final post credit scene hints at a sequel. Please don't.",Ghostbusters
1228,MrUnimpressed,"Job well done, a timeless classic forever ruined",2,16 November 2016,"Im not going to bother wasting any time giving the usual spiel and summary of the plot that is Ghostbusters, everyone that has lived a happy life has seen the original and if they are lucky that is the only version they have seen. Let's cut straight to the chase and tackle the real issue, the horrific one hour and fifty-six murder of a timeless classic. Where do I begin for this atrocity that has now plagued the cinema screens and televisions around the world. First off and foremost the acting was not the real problem here, Chris Hemsworth was for the most past a small shining light of humour on an otherwise toilet humour ridden and comically poor film. He tried his best, with success at times to stop the audience from crying themselves to sleep from the traumatic murder of a cult classic film, it was refreshing to see him in a completely new role, that being the good looking intern blonde bimbo that the four female leads put up with purely based on the fact they enjoyed drooling over him regardless of how utterly useless he was as an office receptionist. The classic sexist role reversal was cleverly done and Chris Hemsworth pulled it off with style and ease. The writing in my eyes was the real reason this movie could never hold a candle to the original, written by Paul Feig and Kate Dippold who have worked on the somewhat funny 'The Heat' wrote a terrible script that was evident not even the actors reading it believed in its humour. That was clear as countless times during the film the actors looked like they were delivering the lines purely based on the fact they were on the page and they were told to memorise them. The jokes were very forced with little meaning to the actual situation at hand, and when everything else failed they resorted to fart jokes on more than one occasional, hence the toilet humour was evident. The editing did them no favours with the action sequences, if you were to call them that, poorly thrown together like a broken jigsaw puzzle that made it looks like a poorly executed live action Disney movie. Not only was the action sequences thrown poorly together but the simple progression of the movie was disjointed, at one point they clearly explain that the ghosts cannot be killed merely trapped in devices of the Ghostbusters own making. Skip to the final battle scenes and you have all four characters slaughtering ghosts left right and centre like they are Gerard Butler mindlessly chopping through Persian foes in 300. Like two children that always cause trouble and harm others in the playground Paul Feig and Kate Dippold should not be able to sit, or work together ever again. I speak for everyone on the school yard that is in the cinematic audience of the world when I say when those two are put together bad things happenlike this movie.",Ghostbusters
1229,anonicalkiwi,This movie made me hate women in its running time--and I'm a woman.,1,5 February 2017,"I'm a female minority, and I found this movie offensive. I've never watched the original Ghostbusters, so I went into this thing blind and unaware save for huge advertisements floating around Taiwan and Japan during my trip overseas. Nothing in this film is funny. I watched this ""film"" with my family in the comfort of my home, loosened and bubbly by snacks and beverages and ready to see what the fuss about the box office flops was. My easygoing parents didn't even chuckle during the whole thing except when I threw out verbal sarcasm to point out how unfunny the script was. Everyone's delivery was terrible. The leading actors were cut and dry stereotypes of deadpan, goof, loud aggressor, and hyperactive lump. The one who ticked me off the most was what's-her-face (?), Jillian Holtzmann. (Had to dig for it.) She felt like she was there for no reason other than to remind the audience of how dumb and annoying women can be. If the director intended to give women a more powerful role, this character did the exact opposite for me. Eating chips while trying to perform a task to save your jeopardized life? Very funny. Dancing and acting goofy to impress the more serious character? Hilarious, am I right? Who does this in real life? No, seriously, who does this with any degree of common sense or self-control? The other character who ticked me off was Kevin because I couldn't imagine how anyone so inept and clueless in the world could function in society before landing a job with the main characters. Call me picky, but things like this really make me hate characters to an nth degree. He wasn't funny, he wasn't sharp or sarcastic, and his odd mash-up of tropes made me question his in-character I.Q. and sexuality. I don't know if this was just my copy of the movie, but there was odd letter-boxing around the film that was intentionally put there to create a 3D effect whenever goo shot out of the ghouls. And the occasional energy beam. The effects were dull, the characters all unlikable, the script poor, and the running time a struggle to get through. After the first few action scenes, my family unanimously voted to turn off the TV which almost never happens. Summing it up, I am embarrassed and ashamed. Women deserve better than this multi-million dollar piece of trash. The men in this film deserve better if only because they felt cast as knock-off props to sneer at. This film made me disgusted at women during the running time I sat through because it pointed out everything wrong with how they should be. They weren't empowering, they weren't funny, they weren't responsible, they weren't easy to relate to, they weren't remotely logical or smart outside their fictional field of study. They were unpleasant to listen to, unappealing to look at, and unsophisticated. This is trash. The characters (not the actors) are trash. My mind feels like trash for even having to think so negatively of my own gender, and while I can acknowledge that it's over-the-top and whiny, that is simply how I feel about this movie. Please don't watch this. Vacuum the house or something. Vacuum the house if this movie is ever playing in your residence. Maybe you'll catch a ghost in the carpet or something, I don't know.",Ghostbusters
1230,garyrdriscoll,That Sony Pictures manipulated the public with a virtue signalling marketing campaign.,1,15 July 2016,"That Sony Pictures manipulated the public with a virtue signalling marketing campaign. The movie studios like controversy sometimes, like with the new Ghostbusters movie, it mean they can promote their movie to a group, or social movement. They deleted non-sexist, well thought out opinions. On the other hand, wildly sexist, racist, and illiterate remarks were being left untouched. This can only mean they wanted these controversial remarks to be see as the majority. By stirring this pot, Sony made it a huge media frenzy, and everyone on both sides of the controversy have fallen for it. How do I know this, because watched while they did it to my posts and and others. This can only mean they wanted these controversial remarks. Now everyone has to see the movie because they are a social justice warrior, curious what the fuss is about, or to prove they are not a misogynist. In other words.Sony Pictures created a gender conflicted to help sell this movie, and we all fell for it. I saw the new Ghostbusters. It's not the worst movie ever made, nor even the worst movie this year. This was worthy of a Redbox rental (not my first choice either) and not a trip to the movies. The ""reboot"" part of the new Ghostbusters movie is the problem, not the female cast. There are a few cherished classics like Ghostbusters, Back to the Future, etc, that I feel should not mess with. Now if this was a new Ghostbusters movie, and these ladies (who I like by the way) were opening up their own franchise years later, maybe in a different city, I would like with that. I hate how people are spinning it so if you don't like the movie, then you are sexist or a hurt fanboy. I love the kick butt female ""Rey"" character from the new ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" movie...because she is a new kick butt female character. But I would have been upset if the say made Luke, a Lisa in a Star Wars reboot. Please make some new female characters and new female heroes, not recycled male roles. There are many awesome female actresses, some of which are in this movie, who deserve new roles they can make their own.

I also thought showing women as completely incompetent of any scientific or logical thought was frowned upon now days, although I know showing all men as complete irrational, one dimensional idiots as they did in this movie is now considered not only OK but mandatory.
I couldn't believe they included a whole discussion of the movie ""Ghost"" which no one under 45 remembers. Half of the actresses can only know this film from their studies of ancient classics but had to pretend they have regular wet dreams about a geriatric actor.

1233,monstervisiontvfilms-28632,Dead on arrival,1,10 July 2016,"As far as the end result... ...the film completely fell flat across the board. I have nothing against the four leads. I more or less blame the writers, director and the studios choice of direction for the new Ghostbusters.The acting is some of the most stiff and cookie cutter I have ever seen. There were times when it really sounded like they were reading their lines. The actors did NOT mesh well at all and their interaction with all of the blue and green screen effects was lifeless and clueless.I was just lost with the approach on their attempted humor. I mean, it's bad. I don't know what panel sat around the table reading the script and laughed at it, but I hope they never do again.The effects were horrible. Every time, which was A LOT, they used a green screen, I found myself taken away from the movie.The film constantly contradicts it's own established continuity. One minute they can't kill the ghosts, only contain them, the next, they can. Just ridiculous.They even added a segment to the movie early on that shows the four girls poking fun at all of the hate for the film. I just don't think the studio gets it. More mocking of the very people they expect to pay top dollar for their product.Despite all of the sexist remarks towards the movie, the movie itself is EXTREMELY sexist against men and borderline racist. All men are portrayed as fools in the movie and in order to kill the final villain they have to shoot him in the crotch. It almost seems the team behind the film knew how stereotypical and sexist their movie was, so they capitalized on the sexism against the film in order to hide that.I honestly recommend wearing a padded glove when you watch this, IF you watch this. I have never face-palmed so many times during a movie in my life. I would not suggest this film to anyone except maybe children under ten years old and even then, it would simply be for a cartooned 3D experience.I wish I could find positives because I dislike being so negative about a film. I understand completely the amount of work that goes into something like this. Chris Hemsworth was probably the best part of this believe or not. I could see him leading a team of his own Ghostbusters in another version if written correctly.But I can't help but quote Jurassic Park concerning the very idea of this film.The filmmakers ""were so preoccupied with whether or not they could that they didn't stop to think if they should.""I really did try to give this film a chance despite all of the negative hype. But, the film was not funny and does not stand on it's own. Honestly, the only thing that intrigued me was seeing the cameos from some of the original cast.I will add that if you were thinking you had seen the majority of the movie throughout all of the trailers, various clips, TV spots, etc., you would have been thinking correctly. Sony used all of what they considered to be the best material in all of the promotional releases. Let that be your red flag considering how poor the trailers were.If someone were to ask me if they should go see it, I would say, ""No, but if you are curious, just wait for it to become available for Internet streaming.""I don't think people will walk away from this movie afraid of ghosts. I imagine they walk away afraid of the movie and more so, the people who thought it was wise to make it in the first place.There is some irony here. Ghostbusters 2016 has literally become a ghost. It was dead on arrival.",Ghostbusters

Let me explain, as the movie opens I try and keep an open mind in spite of all the bad press and terrible trailers and awful things Fieg said about the people who pay to see his movies. I watched and immediately as the first jokes rolled off the ladies tongues, something about queefs I was done. I immediately knew what I had paid 7 bucks for (matinee). Two hours of old poop, fart, and race jokes. I almost fell asleep and had to stand while I watched. I was in the middle of the theater but it didn't matter if I might be blocking someone's view because I was the only one there. Apparently, this movie made 46 million. I have to say, I don't believe it.",Ghostbusters

They love to ruin childhoodsNot a single joke from any of the main four main actresses landed. The only funny character in the movie was Chris Hemsworth. AND HE'S NOT EVEN IN THE MOVIE THAT MUCH!!! The special effects are mediocre as hell for what's supposed to be a summer blockbuster. The movie contradicts itself TWICE and it comes to a grinding halt every 15-20 minutes to make a reference to the original source material to try and save itself, which it fails miserably at. And every single male character in this movie is either a complete idiot, an outright douche bag, or an antisocial weirdo in the case of the villain. This wouldn't be a problem if the whole marketing campaign was built around how ""all haters are misogynistic men.""

I love the originals (have the merchandise and watch them regularly now) and I loved this. The main cast is funny, the nods to the original bring back the nostalgia and I don't think it was trying to be anything more than it was - a funny, great CGI, fun film.As for those who say it's 'man hating' - get a grip. Women taking the lead in a film is a good thing, stop being to misogynistic. I rarely wrote reviews, but to put this article 3.5/10 is ridiculous. It's a good film.",Ghostbusters
1237,petelarrivee,"Spoiler-free, but it is rather spoiled",3,20 July 2016,"We have a lot of ground to cover, so let's address the elephant in the room first. This is not a feminist movie. I am not a misogynist for disliking it. I can explain myself simply in this: The movie is bad because of the MALE DIRECTOR not the female cast.With that out of the way, let's dive in.This movie does have some genuinely funny moments, most notably Chris Hemsworth's Murray-worthy ad-libbing and Kate McKinnon is obviously the only other person having fun on-set. Oh, look, I liked the pretty ones, I must be a real misogynist. No. I'm not. I just recognize when actors are giving it their all and not just checking off the boxes on their 'emotion' checklist for a scene. Supposedly Melissa McCarthy and Kristen Wiig both hated working on this movie, and it shows.Now for the significant problems: The script is terrible. I mean, it's god awful. The plot is almost complete drivel, the villain is bland and cookie-cutter, the special effects are CGI cartoons (and an ACTUAL cartoon at one point, which made me literally groan out loud.) The entire movie isn't a real Ghostbusters movie, it's a spoof on Ghostbusters, and done without the heart or love that anyone who actually likes Ghostbusters would have. The jokes are a theme-less combination of slapstick, grossout humor, awkward pauses and occasional cerebral jabs. Much like the rest of this movie, which tonally, is completely all over the map. One of our first jokes is a fart joke (Or a queef joke. Good job, Paul. Gurl Power,) and yes, there is a scene where Melissa McCarthy straps on a proton pack and ends up falling on her butt. Oh, Paul Feig, master of wit, do show us the way. The story itself has major problems with tone, having two deaths come before a grand CGI finale with a giant cartoon ghost and crotch-shots with proton guns.The entire third act is a green-screen nightmare of lunacy with parts apparently specifically shoe-horned in to irritate and infuriate the fans, including at one point Slimer and a female Slimer (you can tell because it has a beehive wig and lipstick. What gender-bending insight!)Finally, the supposedly awesome Girl Power fight scene comes after an entire movie of the women being, basically, bumbling fools. It's almost blatantly manipulative, and underwhelming, very obviously trying to give us an epic scope and feel... for all of three minutes before the movie is back to dumb jokes about the mimbo secretary and cartoony special effects.But here's where pretty much the entire movie, tone, premise, marketing, concept, defenders, and SJW ranters all fall apart. See, the mayor of New York and the Department of Homeland Security know the Ghostbusters are fully qualified and capable of handling the supernatural threat, and encourage them to do so, but their efforts are swept under the rug and the mayor's office officially labels them as frauds ""so as not to cause a panic.""So let me get this straight... the supposedly feminist movie about four female characters features a powerful male figure condemning their efforts while, in secret, encouraging them to keep trying?And I'm the misogynist for thinking that the world, and women specifically, deserve a better movie than this? Well, I've got one thing to say to Sony, the complicit mass media, the screaming defenders of this movie, and every idiot who tells me not supporting this movie is tantamount to misogyny:Queef jokes.That's what we've been brought. If I were a woman, I'd punch Paul Feig in his smug little face and shove a proton-gun shaped tampon up his... nose.See, I can be civil.",Ghostbusters

That's after really really looooooong drawn out ""jokes"" that they even explained. It's like watching a SNL sketch that really should have ended one minute after it started, but an hour later it's still going on. (and I like SNL, too...)I'm not even sure what they were attempting with this movie. To make us laugh? To make a new generation love the Ghostbusters franchise? They failed miserably at both of those. Ghostbusters II was an amazing Oscar award winning movie in comparison to this flick - and that's really saying something...Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz Not even worth the free rental from Netflix. I want the time back from my life this movie just stole.At least Chris Hensworth was funny the few moments he was on the screen. He was the ONLY entertaining value of this film.",Ghostbusters
1239,alex-06662,"It's a fun filled couple of hours, what more can you ask for?",8,14 July 2016,"I don't think I can ever say I have seen such controversy online surrounding a movie for so long before it's release although you get a sense that this surge of negativity may help the film as it has been front and centre for months now.As for the film I thoroughly enjoyed it. Is it perfect? No, but it did make me laugh throughout and most can be forgiven as long as a comedy makes you laugh. Although I enjoyed the film and found it both funnier and more frightening than he original i do feel it lacks the magic touch that would have allowed it to become a classic.Pro's 1. The chemistry between the four women was very natural and enjoyable to watch. 2. The film had good pacing, if on the rare occasion a joke missed the mark a funnier one was always around the corner. 3. Theeffects and in particular the 3D were fantastic, easily the best use of 3D I have seen in a movie. 4. Kate McKinnon. Her action sequence alone made me fall in love with her character. 5. Chris Hemsworth offers a great comedic turn even if his character sometimes becomes 'too' stupid. 6. The throwbacks. Even though I am not overly familiar with the original I appreciated the odd cameo to the original. 7. Real heroes. The four women are ordinary people who are heroes because they needed to be not because they had to prove themselves. 8. The end battle featured 'actual' action sequences something missing from the original.9. The credits. You actually wanted to sit through the entire credits due to the effects and extra clips they showed and they then reward you with an after credits scene a la Marvel. 10. The film is genuinely scary with some conjuring like moments.Con's1. The villain was a major disappointment and very basic. His reasoning was something that has been done over and over and lowered the quality of the second half of the film. 2. There was no real introduction to Melissa McCarthy or Kristen Wiigs's characters. 3. The film doesn't help itself with its references to the 'online haters'. 4. It portrays nearly everyone apart from the four Ghostbusters as idiots both men and women. 5. Occasionally the cinematography is lacking, especially from a film with a budget well north of $100 million.Overall though the film is a fun and enjoyable experience with multiple laugh out loud moments and a few scary ones thrown in for good measure.",Ghostbusters

I don't understand why so many people are giving it bad reviews, i think its a wonderful compliment to the old movie, and honestly it gives Ghostbusters another life to live!

1241,bretzawesomeproductions,This is TERRIBLE,1,16 July 2016,"To be totally honest, this movie is pure garbage. Anyone who claims to like the movie has never seen the original, is paid to say that, written by Sony employees, or are just plain lying. The movie itself was bland and unfunny, with mile a minute jokes that didn't even bring a smirk to my face. Oh and for all you feminists complaining we are hating on it because it has women, that's not the case. This movie is pure trash. It would be just as bad with men in it. And if you really want to complain us men are being sexist, why aren't you complaining at the fact that EVERY man is portrayed as stupid or evil. One of the characters (Kevin) is hired only for his looks, even though he is dumper than a brick. But nobody complains about this being sexist, only ""funny"". But I guarantee if this was a woman character, the internet would be in fury over that being extremely sexist. So yes, this entire movie is extremely sexist (towards us men). In short, do not go and see this movie, it is utter garbage.",Ghostbusters
1242,jakeunbound,It's just not good or funny,3,24 July 2016,"I ignored the hate from the beginning when the reboot was announced because I was a big Ghostbusters fan, although I could not avoid admitting the trailers were bad. All of them said the movie wasn't going to be good and that it was nothing more than a cash grad, but I was going to see the movie either way.Unfortunately, it seems they were right. The movie suffers from a terrible script, bad characters, plot holes, bad pacing and editing.There were some things I enjoyed. The first 15 minutes were pretty good along with the first ghost in the mansion which gave that eerie and ominous feeling. Many of the action scenes were also great as well along with them bring back the original theme song.You have your two doctors/scientist that are best friends Erin Gilbert(Kristen Wiig) and Abby Yates (Melissa McCarthey), the Engineer/inventor Jillian Holtzmann (Kate McKinnon), and the Historian Patty Tolan (Leslie Jones). You have their receptionist Kevin (Chris Hemsworth). Rowan played by Neil Casey is the main villain. While the 4 ghostbusters have some form of chemistry together, most of the character are just bland or terrible.I have no problem with Kristen's character, but she just doesn't stand out. I actually like Kate's over the top, eccentric, and full odd quirks. However, Melissa's character isn't much better than some of her other movies like The Heat, Spy, etc. (and I find those movies OK). Just obnoxious and loud. Leslie's character was basically type cast just for her; she was pretty good at first until the later half where she turned into what she is know for being the loud and sassy black woman negative stereotype which was not fun to watch. Although there were about 2 actually funny lines. Hemsworth's character had a few funny lines as well, but his was just there for eye candy and was so unbelievably stupid that I just don't see how he can function in real life. Rowan was just a flawed villain and his motivation just doesn't sense or there's more to it, but not in the final cut of the movie. He's bullied and now he wants revenge? He builds a portal, electrocutes himself to become a powerful ghost and then opens the portal to flood the city with them.My biggest problem with the movie is the humor or rather how bad it is and lack of it. Most of the jokes are not funny and come out as forced and delivered badly. The in your face toilet humor and slapstick humor (the queef joke, getting vomited on sexual jokes) falls flat most of the time and some of them like the lip syncing to an 80s song or the huge dance scene by the cops are just flat out unnecessary. There were a lot of references to the original Ghostbusters that also came out as forced. I will say that Cecily Strong's character (Jennifer) did a few funny scenes.The plot and editing have some serious problemsThe last fight looked terrible and was obviously in front of a green screen.They were capturing ghost at first, then all of a sudden they just decide to kill them? Why?Rowan's motivation stated earlier didn't make sense, but he was going to kill himself and comeback as a powerful ghost with powers that others didn't display? How does that work out? And why didn't he just freeze the Ghostbusters?They ride in the Ecto 1 and then come out in jumpsuits? Also the Ecto 1 jumps from a Hearse from one scene to one with the nuclear reactor. The final act of the movie just seemed rushed as well and was just terrible.Also the cameos were OK although even though Ernie Hudson at the end of the movie, while Sigourney Weaver in the credits, while Bill Murray gets killed off during his cameo (must of been for the fact they he declined and Sony threatened action against him, or maybe for refusing to do Ghostbusters 3 in the first place). Annie Potts returns as a Desk Clerk (sound familiar?) Also Slimer enjoys a joyride in the Ecto 1, while Dan Aykroyd was just a Taxi Driver who was the best out of all because of his scientific knowledge of ghost.I'll give it a 3 because of a few decent cameos, a few good jokes, and a few decent songs on the soundtrack. You're better off watching it when it comes on Netflix or Redbox, perhaps the Extended edition since the original cut of the movie was over 4 hours.",Ghostbusters
1243,ceraofficial,"Not bad, but not good",5,17 July 2016,"Okay, i am not a sexist or anything even close. I love women. they are great ;) For this movie, i went in really hoping it would surprise me! Okay, lets start!!! I loved some of the comedy, i laughed more than a few times! And i felt like i was on a ride with it all!!!The ONLY things that let the movie down were the lack of consistency in one of the lead actresses, i don't remember her name, but it's the blonde one. She was so out of tune and her acting was very up and down. I couldn't get into her character, and it ruined the movie for me. One second she is dancing around and being fun and weird and loving.. the next she is apparently some crazy gunslinger who can do all these cool action scenes.. and then finally (Thing that completely ruined it) she tried to be disconnected and intrusive when she does her toast. I don't know if it was a joke or whatever, but as a normal viewer (no professional opinion here) of the movie, her acting kept me from enjoying the movie. While i did like the comedy, not all of it was really that funny, some of it felt like it was trying too hard, and a lot of the movie was just trying to bask in the previous two cult classics. In my opinion, seeing the old characters come back was cool... But very forced. I would have loved the movie a lot more if this movie was a sequel, and we got to see some of the original characters play small roles in helping these girls become better Ghostbusters.. Dunno people, this is my first review, and it probably isn't helpful! I would recommend seeing the movie though so you can make your own judgment on it. And hey, 5/10 isn't bad.",Ghostbusters

It has a wonderful and hilarious all female cast that will keep you laughing until the end. For you ladies out there, Chris Hemsworth plays a funny character in the movie. There are also cameos from some of the original cast like Bill Murray and Dan Akkroyd. Also, some of the ghosts from the original movie like Slimer and Puff the Marshmallow Man.

Yes, I saw the previous ones ages ago, I feel like I had to say that because I'm going through the reviews and it feels like a lot of people are using it an excuse. As a reboot it was amazing.I just wanted to write a review from my perspective. It's really refreshing to see a woman character to be portrayed in a manner that was very attractive to women (not necessarily typically) or maybe I just really like her. I don't know, not enough Holtz out there, just take my money. So yeah, I have a favourite.I loved the friendships in the movie, supportive characters intertwined with action. I loved how the big four, Erin, Abbey, Patty and Holtz were unforgettable. I feel invested in them and I wanted them to keep going afterwards and I'm waiting for a sequel. Patty's uncle must've loved her a lot to let her borrow the hearse for such a long time also alluding to a healthy family dynamic.Ghostbusters a fun block buster that went beyond my expectations and I would see it again. Sure as a story it got choppy, but it never felt story driven, the comedic timing was on point. Reboot Pro - it kept the to the fun side.Credits/ending bits - super funny, you can feel everyone involved enjoyed their time there and were very proud of the movie. They cared about editing. I can also never complain about cameos.Spoiler: Omg that dance number.If you didn't see the dance number, man you missed out.",Ghostbusters

This unpaid review is coming from a guy who fully hated the marketing! Terrible job from SONY! Literally TERRIBLE job with the marketing! Truly GB16 was a blast and it doesn't deserve the hate, it just doesn't, but I can understand why! The only thing I wish they could have fixed was the pointless MARVEL villain in the first two acts, still loved his ultimate form, it kinda reminded me of The Real Ghostbusters cartoon! Also the cameos didn't felt forced in my opinion, except for Murray's, he's still amazingly funny in his role, better than Rock the Kasbah, that's for sure!Probably the best 3D experience in a while!

The tempo of the film was fine (not great) but i liked the characters and the acting was good (but Kristen wiig seriously makes me cringe sometimes...) And overall it was very entertaining! I laughed so much I cried at some points in it. It has a lot of similarities to the old ghostbuster film (some ghosts are the same and whatnot) but they have made enough changes that it doesn't feel like I'm just watching the same film but with different actors. I saw a review saying that the film only relied on cameos but the cameos was very minor and was more of the stan lee kind so I do not see that as a problem.

I think the only downfall was that the comedic chops of Kristin Wiig and Melissa McCarthy weren't put to good use. They can be funny! Let them be funny! I think they definitely knew there would be a lot of people mad about the gender swap, so they played it a bit too safe. But Kate McKinnon is awesome and made me laugh out loud several times. Chris Hemsworth played the dumb blonde really well (a role typically reserved for women, imagine that?!). All the people complaining about it ""ruining their childhoods"" - how many Spidermans have their been? How many Batmans? Get over it. This was a fun reboot and it was awesome to see women in charge for a change, without them being just a hot chick or a love interest.I hope there's a sequel so they can branch out a bit more and really make the crybabies weep that their complete gaslighting of this movie didn't work.",Ghostbusters

This movie is for the people who want to see themselves in a nice light; where they can see that girls can do STEM, make stupid jokes, and even though they may be underdogs people will appreciate them someday. It stayed true to the original films, the ghosts looked like the ones from the previous, so I don't know why people are complaining there. (Yes I do).

1250,vsayer,A really enjoyable film that's been too heavily criticised,8,31 July 2016,"If I could, I'd give this a 7.5/10.For some reason- and I actually don't think it's due solely to misogyny, people have said some truly horrible things about this film. People criticized the comedy, implying that the original ghostbusters was some 10/10 comedy where you're lying on the floor laughing, which it simply wasn't. The whole idea behind ghostbusters is to be a little bit silly, quite sweet at times and to kick some ghost butt and this film definitely did that. To those who say that the film contained 'awful racist stereotyping' in Leslie Jones's character, have you ever seen an interview with Leslie Jones? She talks that way, it's who she is and she's brilliant. Leslie Jones is awesome and most likely put that whole spin on her character and for you to say that's 'racist stereotyping' is to say that Leslie's personality is somehow racist? If they had cast Kerry Washington or Halle Berry and then forced them to act in a kind of 'urban stereotype.' of course that would have been racist. But Leslie Jones was great in this film and stop trying to turn this into something it's not. Anyway, I really liked this film. It was funny and witty. The story line wasn't the most ingenious but that's the most important thing in a comedy about killing ghosts. Kate Mckinnon was especially fantastic and provided the Weird that ghostbusters needs. Melissa McCarthy's character was endearing and Kristen Wiig pulled off her awkward, tweed-wearing character well. The CGI was extra ridiculous and added to the fun of the film, I particularly appreciated the slime and there are some awesome fighting scenes that contain the perfect balance between funny and kick-ass.This film is not man-hating. People complained that every mam in the film was either dumb or evil. The are TWO main male characters in the film. I'd also like to point out that Chris Hemsworth's character of the ditsy receptionist is just simply changing the gender of the original female receptionist. Would you have preferred them to change the gender of the ghostbusters, but keep the receptionist a woman? That makes zero sense. The other man was the villain and what's wrong with that? Seriously I don't see the problem, they probably made the character a man to even out the women to man ratio. Were they supposed to create a whole new MALE character who was liked just to appease those who leap at the phrase man-hating whenever there's an openly feminist film released.When you watch this film, just embrace it for what it is, a bit of fun. Don't try to pick at it because you'll ruin it and it's supposed to be enjoyed.",Ghostbusters
1251,emmaandaugust,A paranormal research team becomes established when 3 scientists and a historian use their skills to work together to save New York from a paranormal apocalypse.,10,14 August 2016,"I went into the movie prepared to not like it because I had heard some bad reviews (these reviews didn't actually have anything to say about the movie but that it was bad). I've got to say that I smiled throughout the entire movie and I don't think there was a person in the theater who wasn't thoroughly enjoying themselves. I saw the movie with 4 other people and we all loved it so much. It's the only movie within my memory that I've wanted to see in theaters more than once.I really appreciated that the female characters were strong and smart and even though they'd had disagreements they weren't petty about them. They acted like real people. And they were funny without being really offensive, which some people find hard for some reason? I think this movie has good role models for young girls and boys; there are 3 women scientists and a history nerd who aren't ""sexed up"" for the male gaze. They are belittled and ridiculed for their beliefs but they overcome that to do the right thing, not to prove themselves to anyone. And they're really cool while doing it, too.The special effects feels real but not too real in a good way. I guess to say that they're not painful to watch (as an animation student I get very upset over bad effects) but there is a cheesiness to them that is endearing. I think this movie is something that anyone can enjoy as long as they don't mind women being treated like human beings instead of sexy prizes (which is a joke that they play off of using a Hot Dumb Male character, but in the end he's treated like a person and is no one's ""prize"").",Ghostbusters

We get it, the majority of people going to the theater are women with their kids that they will do anything they can not to talk to.

1256,Chuckles_OToole_PBnJ,I loved this movie. Don't believe the hate.,10,24 July 2016,"I loved this movie. I loved the cast, I loved the SFX, I loved the dialogue and the jokes. I thought the plot was a bit thin but the chemistry between the main characters more than made up for it.I loved the action sequences. I love McCarthy, Wiig, and Jones. Kate McKinnon in particular steals the show. I sincerely think Holtzmann is hands down the most badass sci-fi chick since River Tam.I know and have known quite a few STEM geek-girls who are exactly- *exactly*- like Holtzmann in the real world. They're genius smart, they're dorky, they're oblivious to social cues and interactions, and they're totally into their work and the world as they see it.Holtzmann's entire reason for existence is to kick some ghost ass. That's her obsession and her life's work. And not even because she's out for revenge or for any dark reason. She's a true nerd: she just wants to see if it can be done. She's absolutely giddy with all the tech she's tweaking and completely in her element in the lab. And when she pulls out her twin handguns in the big melee fight and licks one before proceeding to bust a bunch of balls, I literally pumped my fist and shrieked ""YES HAHAHAHA"" right out loud in the theater.That and the scene where they walk into the rock concert lobby and she's carrying a huge duffel bag in addition to her proton pack like it's just nothing because she's all biznass, just made me swoon.Now, let's talk about why this movie is getting bashed on the internet and doing poorly.Here's the deal: For whatever reason, a bunch of pale, pasty, friendless internet nutjobs have decided that, because they are powerless in their own lives, they are going to mount an endless, absurd internet hate campaign on a film, simply because they don't like the gender demographic of the cast, so that they can feel like they have control over something. That's just stupid. At the end of the day, the entire cast of this film will still have careers, and your lives will still suck. So good luck with that.It breaks my heart to watch this movie getting shot down in flames by a bunch of worthless, useless internet trolls. Oh well. A lot of my favorite films have been box-office bombs (""Buckaroo Banzai"", ""Dune"", ""The Thing"", ""Serenity""). I'm used to my film heroes getting screwed at the box office. This one in particular just really hurts because this cast deserved so much better. They really poured their guts into their characters. I detest bullying and it infuriates me that a bunch of pale pasty internet scum can influence a deserving group of actors in any way, shape or form. Some people need to be shot, seriously.Honest rating, 7.5 or 8/10. But I gave it 10/10 because the trolls are spamming the rating with 1/10 votes out of sheer spite, so fair's fair.",Ghostbusters

It is bad enough that film after film is a remake, reboot and/or sequel (boycott the new boring Star Wars - aaarrrggh!!!!!), but now they want men to deny their own existence and their own instincts and natures and be interested in man-trashing, man-hating women who among the four of them do not show an iota of attractiveness.I know attraction is a subjective matter, but could we have one woman who has long hair, wears body appropriate clothes and flaunts some skin?? Hey, I go to movies to enjoy and that is what I enjoy. Would it kill you if one woman was capable of killing and capturing ghosts and was in a micro mini skirt? You can keep the other three in baggy suits.

This seemed like watching a pre-adolescent play a video game instead of a film. It's all over the place, repetitive and well, boring. The film gives you no reason to get into it, it's like the scenes are almost disjointed from each other. There is no real flow to this movie.Three decent laughs in an entire film doesn't make a comedy.

If they had played their old characters and somehow worked into the plot, I would have respected that.2) Use a time machine and make the original Ivan Reitman production disappear.

1272,Chanel-Hilton,I Expected To Hate This Movie... I LOVED It!,9,15 July 2016,"I just wanna start off by saying that most of the negative reviews on here are from people who haven't yet seen the movie, who hate the direction it went in with an all female cast, and generally just hate that they remade one of their childhood favourites and are butthurt, so ignore them.Ever since the first trailer came out I thought this looked awful, me and some of my work colleagues talked about how unfunny it looked and how some of the scenes looked cringe- worthy. The day it came out in England I had a chance to see it for free - from what I thought the movie was gonna be like there would have been no way in hell I would've paid to see it, but it was free, my friends wanted to see it and I do like Wigg, McCarthy and Hemsworth so thought I might as well go. I am so glad that I did. The movie is nothing like what I expected, it was actually funny, it had so many great references to the original and it was just an all-round fun movie! I was gutted when it finished since I wanted more. All the cast are brilliant and have their own hilarious moments and one liners, especially Hemsworth who was hilarious. I loved trying to spot the cameos from the old cast. My only nitpick is the 3rd act where it did get a little bit CGI heavy, but even still it was fun to watch and still had laugh out loud moments - the whole audience were in stitches throughout the whole film. I'll definitely be buying this on DVD when it is released. I also wanna mention that the comedy in this film is very much like the directors previous films (Bridemaids, Spy and The Heat, all of which I loved) so if you didn't enjoy those 3 movies or find them funny, you probably won't like the humour in Ghostbusters - but if you did, you'll love this movie!",Ghostbusters

1277,psgalvanek,If This is What Passes for Comedy ...,1,21 July 2016,"Wife and I don't get out to the movies often these days but when a close friend who works at a local newspaper offered us free passes to a midweek showing of Ghostbusters in exchange for our feedback we figured we both count ourselves as Melissa McCarthy fans so there was nothing to lose. How wrong we were. What can you say about a movie that you see for free and still feel like you were cheated? Well here are a few things.Leslie Jones, wow that was terrible. Truly painful to watch and one of the worst performances in a movie ever witnessed. Not merely because of her lack of acting chops, the character itself is not so subtly reminiscent of something from a minstrel show, so it's doubtful anyone could have done much with it and you can't help but feel embarrassed for her. Imagine Eddie Murphy's SNL skit Buckwheat Sings the Blues, but presented as a legitimate recording artist in 2016. Leslie should fire her agent immediately for having even brought her this script.Note the qualifier ONE of the worst because ...right there next to her is Kate McKinnon delivering a far worse performance in the same film. Stiff, monotonous, funerial, utterly unbelievable ... sorry those words don't even begin cover it. If there were a way to make such a wager, place your money on - she was reading her lines from cue cards someone was holding next to the camera she was staring into. More than a couple scenes where she tried to spin hipness into her squint character with some truly awkward physical ""comedy"" that where literally cringe inducing. At least Leslie's poorly conceived character provides her some measure of cover, Kate McKinnon's epic failure is all her own.Beyond the those two horrific performances the screen writing was an unmitigated disaster. From one early scene with its painfully obvious anti-Trump ""joke,"" it quickly devolves into one poorly delivered left-wing sucker punch after another not one of which was even remotely funny. Very sad to see Melissa McCarthy involve herself with such a caustic and unpleasant project as she may never be able to wash the stench of this catastrophe off of herself.Unlike the majority of the twenty or so people who were in theater with us when it began, we hung around until the end wondering if it could deliver one, single solitary laugh, a chuckle, a chortle ... anything ... but alas none were to be had. Lots of head shaking, eye rolling and a few exasperated WOWs exchanged between those of us leaving as the credits rolled.Indeed, as we started to say, if this is what passes for comedy in Hollywood today then nobody should be wondering why they're taking a beating at the box office lately and the people who made this mess deserve to take a bath on it.",Ghostbusters

Then again, this one is by far the worst one I've ever seen, and it makes even something like the new Nightmare on Elm Street shine in comparison.Dialogues are forced and dumbed-down and the genre has been switched up from the original's dark comedy to an all-family infantile flick. Your 5-year-old will likely enjoy it, whereas your 8-year-old will tell you that it's childish and silly.Come to think of it - the entire Hollywood comedy genre has been experiencing a slow, agonizing, death over the course of the past 20 years.

I was born in 1990, therefor I only watched the first two ghostbusters films on VHS and home video. Im a huge fan of both films and couldn't be happier to see a new film in theaters. many of the people in the theaters cheered and laughed during the film and once slimer appeared with his ms. slimer, people stood up and clapped. It was a surreal experience. This really makes the movie going experience more enjoyable when you have a room full of fun loving people who are having a fun time with the film. Is it a perfect film and better than Ghostbusters 1 and 2? No, but Im not sure that was the point. This is simply a fun film. There were a few kids in the theater as well, when they left one little girl had her action figure of Rowan the Destroyer and Patty in her hands and told her dad ""Daddy I want to watch the other Ghostbusters movie now too""",Ghostbusters

The music was surprisingly good, but what could possibly be bad about anything that involves Elle King. Do stay through the credits. There's a piece at the end that is stellar.Wigg and McCarthy are very believable besties, and McKinnon pulls off psycho scientist well. It's Leslie Jones who steals the show.

But the characters were funny, it has that 80's charm and everything felt original, fresh. Had a sequel, more of the same but you can watch for entertainment and enjoy the original ingredients once more, without dying in the process.Many years later, as most of 80's revamps of cult movies We get this atrocious homage, in a world where Ghostbusters 1 and 2 never happened, despite everything is pretty much a copy of the first one but with four girls instead of four guys.Yeah, this people watched the movies that's based on at least, so the winks are everywhere for you to know this. They even managed to put Ernie Hudson, Sigourney Weaver and Bill Murray somewhere, being this last a funny one appearance. You can also watch Andy García and some other famous actors, but if you have the curiosity just watch them in YouTube.The first part of the movie was just predictive, with no memorable characters or events. The second one was painful to watch and dull, they really try with everything They have, but doesn't get to an approved. Performances are just fine, but characters fail to be of any interest. Remarkable ghosts are the ones from the original... at least CGI's are flawless and Kristen Wiig is beautiful, some girls will also enjoy Chris Hemsworth's show, but this is sad.There's nothing more to say without spoil the reasons why the ghosts are everywhere and how they disappear.

This movie has many references to the original while still being its own thing. The jokes are funny, the camaraderie between the cast is palpable, the storyline is interesting...
I read a review when this movie first came out that said they were offended by Chris Hemsworth's character Kevin because he's so dumb.Shall we unpack this?Offended because the character itself is so dumb, or offended because the MALE character is so dumb?How many movies have women been portrayed as the ""dumb blondes"" of the film; the dumb receptionist; the helpless damsel in distress..?This movie does an amazing job of ""reversing the polarity"" of all the toxic masculinity movies of the past by having a strong, smart, entertaining, and funny all-female lead.",Ghostbusters

The four women who are portraying the heroes in this remake massacre it in style. Melissa McCarthy tries her best with the same humour i found funny in Spy, but ended up with the lack clustered not funny, OTT you may recently find in The Boss. The Egor (harold Ramis character - Genius) does a Gd job with her role, combining the GSOH of Michaelangelo and the brains of Donatello (quite a few plagiarism elements). Kristen Wiig character (thinking Dan aykroyd style) makes this film into a re-run of a darker version of Bridesmaid, which is for chicks (no offence, but true) her attempt of breaking away from chick flicks, always trying to thick with her loveless heart towards Chris Hemsworth (who is absolutely funny and steals the show - think Jason Statham in Spy). Patty character (the non science folk) tries her best but screams, shout, and the front runner for sexism attributes all the time.

1314,rutharoni,Good summer fun that defies the negative reviews.,8,17 July 2016,"This is the first review I've ever written on IMDb. While I like discussing movies, I rarely feel like I need to inform the public at large as to why they need to go see one... in this instance, I was inspired to write a review simply because this movie has been grossly misrepresented in the other user reviews on this page. Here are the main complaints people seem to have with the movie (that I've read) and why they now, after actually seeing the movie, seem to be a bunch of bologna: 1. It is a copy of the original Ghostbusters. Now, this one confuses me a little bit. If you were not expecting to see a remake of the original Ghostbusters, then what exactly were you expecting to see? A gritty reboot? A prequel? Anyone who went to see this movie knew darn well that it was a remake. There were elements of the plot that were similar to the original Ghostbusters... because it was a remake. In the place of an entirely new plot and setting, there was a fresh-faced cast, better special effects, and different jokes. You know... like a remake. 2. The comedy was unfunny. Comedy has always been subjective, and it always will be. Not everyone likes the style of Kristen Wiig with her clever one-liners mumbled under her breath, or the style of Kate McKinnon with her funny voices and facial expressions. I, my husband, and the rest of the theater in which we were watching the movie, however, were laughing our butts off this whole movie. Chris Hemsworth showed his comedy chops as a clueless receptionist and got some of the biggest laughs in the whole movie. Leslie Jones screaming, ""The power of Patty compels you!"" and smacking a ghost out of Melissa McCarthy's body was pretty darn funny, as well as the mayor of New York proclaiming, ""Don't you EVER compare me to the Jaws mayor!"" and Kristen Wiig trying to unsuccessfully translate every Spanish phrase she came across. Everybody got some good lines in, and to proclaim the whole movie unfunny would be a lie. 3. The Patty character was a black stereotype. I have to admit, I was dubious about this one as well. From the trailers, it looked like Patty would be the street-wise magic black woman of the film. I was happy to find that not the case, though knowing her work on SNL, I should have known she would not let herself be shoehorned into a racial stereotype. Does she speak with a New York city ""black person"" accent? Yes. That's probably because she is a black person who lives in New York city. If you're expecting her to mumble and stutter like Kristen Wiig, you won't be seeing that, since that has never been a part of Leslie Jones' comedy style. You won't find her shaking her head and complaining about ""these white women"" or something like that, either. In fact, her race was not mentioned in any of the dialogue during the film, which I would take as a pointed message: it doesn't matter. She gave a loud, funny, performance, and it balanced nicely with the other actresses, who were all a little quieter. 4. This movie is sexist (against men). Oh, here we go. This is the real big one. I'm sure keyboard heroes behind their computer screens were waiting with fingers poised to write this complaint about this movie. I could almost taste the wounded vindication from all the reviewers who were incredibly quick to point out that all the male characters in this movie were ""2- dimensional"" and ""useless."" I can't even begin to explain the irony of men pointing this out in a female-led action movie and expecting the world to be outraged for them, while women have been making this complaint about almost every action movie since the dawn of the film age (James Bond movies, anyone?). It is so completely tempting to say, ""don't dish it out if you can't take it, fellas."" However, as a mature adult, I will resist. Yes, the male characters in this movie were, on the whole, pretty simple. I would say that is probably because 1) this is a comedy-action movie, not a psychological drama, and 2) THERE WERE NO MALE MAIN CHARACTERS. You know who were developed as characters? The four leads, especially Wiig and McCarthy, who were the stars of the movie. Who, incidentally, were also all female. Shocking, I know. My final thoughts: This is not a movie that is trying to win an Oscar, and you know what? Neither was the original Ghostbusters, so I don't know why people are acting as if this movie has desecrated hallowed ground. It is a summer blockbuster, and a darn good one at that. There was no sex or swearing, it was funny, there were some good action scenes (the final battle with a crowd of ghosts in Times Square is especially cool-looking) and I didn't have to think too hard while I enjoyed my popcorn and a good night of distraction at the movie theater. The only reason I felt I had to write this review was because all the other reviews I saw on here truly misled me before I saw the movie for myself. My best advice to others is to do the same: see it for yourself, and ignore the plethora of writers who seem to be hating this movie for no good reason.",Ghostbusters
1315,bohemia800,Watch the outtakes!,7,31 March 2020,"This movie is really not that bad. I took it as a bit of light entertainment and you know what - I was entertained!
Okay some of the jokes weren't that funny but there are sooo many worse movies out there that get higher scores than this. These women are so talented and funny and if you watch the outtakes on the dvd you'll see what I mean. Some of those scenes that didn't make it into the movie were HILARIOUS. Such a shame that they didn't put those scenes in!Also the movie is worth watching for Kate Mckinnon alone. She is so funny, has amazing comedic timing and energy, some of her lines (and outfits!) I thought were totally iconic! And I ended up falling a little bit in love with her by the end.I understand people's criticisms and I agree that the female ghostbusters could have better, but the fact that there IS a female ghostbusters is amazing in itself and should be celebrated. I for one am proud that the industry and Paul Feig decided to get behind this project and I don't regret buying the DVD at all. I wholeheartedly recommend this movie if you want a giggle and to be entertained.",Ghostbusters
1316,andrewpo,Loved it! It honors the original!,10,18 July 2016,"Really I would give this movie an 8.5. It is truly a funny movie! I laughed almost none stop!

Anyone who said this movie was bad ether A. Didn't see it, or B. Has no sense of humor. I can't wait for Zule!Something else I was surprised about was the Cameos. Normally Cameos bug me a lot.

1317,PiaPuffytail,I'd recommend seeing to judge for yourself.,7,16 July 2016,"Considering how many naysayers there were about this film long, LONG before it came to theaters, I'm not surprised the movie has less than a five star rating on IMDb at the moment. I wonder how many of those reviewers actually went to see the movie?I just saw it today, and I went in with a lot of fear. Because I know that any women-lead movie that is not marketed 100% as a chick-flick is going to have to work (just like real life) twice as hard to be considered nearly as good. Add in the fact that the original Ghostbusters is such a classic, there was going to be a lot of built-in antagonism. Sad but true.So I went in hoping not to see too many cringe-worthy slapstick jokes, and thankfully there were only a handful. There was certainly some physical comedy, but not the really painful kind for the most part. I *was* surprised by some of the just genuine, funny cleverness. The movie even has a bit of self awareness, indirectly referencing some of the online furor over a female-driven Ghostbusters movie. I'm not familiar with Kate McKinnon, but I found her and Chris Hemsworth's comedic acting quite engaging and I think they both brought quite a lot to the table. Was this movie 100% comedy gold? Nah, not really. Was it still worth seeing? Absolutely. Was it *anywhere* near as bad as outraged Ghostbusters fans will be saying it is? Not hardly. My final word: Give it a chance. You might be surprised!",Ghostbusters
1318,ravemangtbc,A fun way to start a new franchise while paying tribute to the old.,7,7 August 2016,"A lot of people are giving this movie serious grief because it's ladies instead of men! Personally I'm glad they did something different with it since an outright sequel never came to be. I feel casting guys in the roles would have been to hard to live up to with the classic performances from the original cast. Introducing new characters for me was the best way to go! I loved all the little nods to the original films and cameos while never claiming to be part of the same universe as them! The movie was funny and shows that women can be smart and funny! Another critic I have seen of the film is that people feel Chris Hemsworth role is pointless and they are upset that the only male lead is a stupid eye candy character. Clearly these people don't get that, that was the entire point of his character it was a play on the way women are usually treated in male films as either pointless, dumb, in need is saving, eye candy or a combination of these so it was intentional the way his character was treated and portrayed in the film and this is just clearly over some peoples heads. Mostly I feel people wanted to not like this film and that most people are just looking for excuses to complain about something! A lot of ""bad"" reviews of this film seem to stem from bigots or racists who hide behind computer screens and are nothing more than weak, cowardly, cyber bullies!",Ghostbusters
1319,greendivinity,Surprisingly funny,9,13 August 2019,This remake works perfectly. The girls are funny in their own way and it adds to the Ghostbuster's cannon.

I loved that almost the whole original cast made cameos. R.I.P. Harold Ramis. The Ghosts were amazing!!It was well worth spending money to see it in theaters. I would love to see it again!!

1321,SeanBlader,As good as the original,8,18 July 2016,"Okay this was so good. As good as the first one definitely! There wasn't nearly as much gross out humor as I thought there'd be, the characters were fun, competent and delightfully awkward.If you are at heart an anti-feminist then this movie is not for you. It's women power, anti-men the whole way. The villain, and Hemsworth's roles both fit right into why you'll hate this movie.But if on the other hand you like women, then hell yeah this is awesome. I'm of the personal opinion that these 2 scientist characters, one engineer, and the horribly awfully stereotypical black lady are all in their own right really fun. Personally as a software developer and wannabe scientist myself I found Kate McKinnon's delivery of all the epic jargon fluid, on spot, and believable, and her awkward carefree antisocialness entirely endearing and super cute. She stole the show for me.So you can ignore the obvious gender and racial stereotypes and have a good time with a decent story, or you can bring your personal internal biases into the theater with you and basically turn your movie ticket and free time into a heaping pile of hate and disgust, I'll leave that to you.",Ghostbusters

1323,hASEROT,What do you get when you combine the movie Batman & Robin with Ghostbusters?..... This movie....,2,18 July 2016,"i bit the bullet and saw the Ghostbusters remake today.... with it's good rating on RT, i figured maybe there was something i missed in the trailers - and who knows, maybe it'll surprise me and not be the train wreck i thought it was going to be, because i have been wrong about movies in the past (ie: The Fast And The Furious)... so i wanted to give it at least the fair chance of watching it before i pass final judgement...it's one of the worst movies i've ever seen. period.....the girls themselves weren't bad though - for once Melissa McCarthy wasn't annoying... Kristen Wiig was alright, until they turned her character into a blithering idiot around Chris Hemsworth... Kate McKinnon was the only one i really didn't care for - too over the top, too cartoony - had they toned her down just a little, she would've been great... but i think Leslie Jones (IMO) was the best one - she was naturally funny, and her deliveries didn't seem forced (except the whole ""race/lady thang"" and ""the power of patty compels you"" parts).. but let me jump back to Chris Hemsworth for a moment... because I saw reviews that said he was hilarious and one of the funniest parts of the movie (even the bad reviews of the movie still praised him).. and while i think he does have comedic chops that do get showcased in this movie - the character he plays is just stupid, and after about 5 minutes I couldn't take it anymore - between him and McKinnon, i really don't know which one I found more annoying..and that's the thing... the entire tone, direction, and story is what made this film just a complete farce... the first hour was ""okay"" - forgettable, but nothing terrible... but the last hour was just bad, and i mean BAAAAAAD - nothing made sense, some things blatantly contradicted themselves, most was left unexplained where you really really had to suspend disbelief for it to even make sense in the context of the movie itself.... just an unfunny, poorly written mess..to sum it all up in a nutshell..... this was the movie Batman & Robin dressed up as Ghostbusters.... just awful.",Ghostbusters
1324,prairychick,Better than I expected!,8,15 July 2016,"I wasn't particularly excited about the new Ghostbusters movie. Why remake a classic? It felt like a gimmick. However, after seeing it, I have to say it was very funny, and not what I would really call a remake. Like many people, I know the original movie well. This movie uses the same basic premise, but changes enough of the plot to keep it fresh. I notice some reviewers complained that all the make characters were either stupid or evil. I say, welcome to the wonderful world of movie stereotypes. Now you know what it feels like. I found it refreshing to see intelligent, strong women who aren't just sidekicks or caricatures. Female scientists! Who would have thought it possible? Best of all were the funny one-liners. Holtzmann had a lot of great ones. Be sure to stay for the closing credits, they're fun.",Ghostbusters

1326,usernamenumber,"A very pleasant surprise (some mild, but labeled, spoilers herein)",9,17 July 2016,"Full disclosure: I was an uncredited extra in the concert scene, but I'll have to watch it on freeze-frame to see if I actually show up, so while being an extra was fun it gives me no personal investment in how the movie does. OK, with that out of the way...I loved this Ghostbusters so much more than I expected to. I didn't expect it to be horrible, certainly not the blight on everyone's childhood that certain people declared it would be, but I also didn't expect it to be more than alright, because reboots are rarely more than alright. I was very pleasantly surprised.Things I loved about it include (but are not limited to)...1) The cast. The main four have amazing chemistry, plus great improv skills that really show in their performances. To me the off-the-cuff style of a lot of the dialogue made the characters come across more like, well, characters interacting and playing off of one another naturally (as naturally as over-the-top characters like Holtzmann should, anyway) than like actors doing a script. Also, you can see ""THIS IS SO MUCH MORE FUN THAN PLAYING THOR"" going off in neon lights in Chris Hemsworth's head every time he does anything, which is delightful. 2) The characters. I get why the first time people saw Holtzmann's hair they became concerned that they were looking at an Egon carbon copy, but nothing could be further from the truth. Each character was distinct (from one another, and from their counterparts in the original), well performed, and brought her own motivations to the team, and her own qualities to the movie. 3) A surprising amount of deadpan humor. I think to really get the most out of this movie you have to appreciate a certain kind of very British-feeling humor that doesn't hang a sign on every joke, which to me just makes them funnier. In retrospect, the opening scene does a brilliant job of setting that tone for the rest of the movie in this regard (if you want to avoid a minor spoiler for that scene, skip to the next paragraph). Imagine a tour guide leading people through a creepy house. He tells the people, sounding dead serious, that this was once one of the most luxurious homes in New York, with such luxuries as a face bidet and anti-Irish security fence, and that it was in this room right here, that wealthy visitor P.T. Barnum first had the idea to enslave elephants. If you didn't crack a smile at that, hopefully there's still plenty of fun, silly movie for you, but I did, and continued smiling at little collisions of serious delivery and slightly absurd content throughout the movie. There were other things I loved (like some of the cameos), and things I thought were OK (like some of the cameos), and things that left me a bit cold but were ultimately shrug- worthy (like some of the cameos), but this wouldn't be a fair review if I didn't also talk about some of the things I really wish were different, so... 1) It didn't need to be a reboot. They had all of the original cast there for cameos! Would it have been so hard to have a backstory where the now-old (and in one case, heartbreakingly dead) originals passed the torch off to the next generation, or to a new franchise in another city (which then gets conveniently cut off by ghostpacalypse), etc. I think the original deserves a successor more than it does a redo, and this could have been a worthy successor.2) Patty was... hrmmm... this gets complicated. A lot of people, many of them white folks like myself, have complained that the one black main character, well, ""acts too black"", to which Leslie Jones has shot back something to the effect of ""F you, I *am* black; don't tell me it's offensive for me to be like myself"", which makes sense, and yet... and yet. Yeah, gotta say, although I appreciate that they took the effort to make her a legit encyclopedic NYC history nerd instead of just being generically ""streetwise"" (aka Dances with Minorities), the character, and Jones' portrayal, still read as uncomfortably stereotypical to me. That said, ""the power of Patty compels you!"" remains one of my favorite bits. 3) Too many lampshades. Yeah, OK, so not all of the jokes, let alone all of the cultural subtext, was as subtle as the deadpan humor I talked about before. (minor spoiler coming next) They defeat a male antagonist ghost by literally shooting him in the crotch (which apparently hurts even in genital-free hulking astral form). Now, if I was this movie, given all the crap and vitriol that got thrown at it just for existing before the Internet had seen so much as a picture, frankly I might want to (metaphorically) shoot something in the balls, too. But still, both comedically and in terms of ""ok, but seriously it has no genitals at all..."" it was pretty dumb IMO, and it's not the only joke that seemed uncharacteristically immature (c.f. a fart joke early on that was way less funny to me than the movie seemed to think it should have been), and some of the references to the original were a bit (sometimes more than a bit) too ""eh? eeeh? see what we did there??"".There are other things I could complain about, like the extent of Holtzmann's technical wunderkinding, and a few physics head-scratchers that stretch credibility even by Ghostbuster standards, but on the whole I thought this was a really great movie; the kind I wouldn't mind seeing again, which is pretty rare for me. Forget the haters, I hope history bears this one out as something worthy of a place on the shelf right next to the original Ghostbusters (possibly cleverly obscuring Ghostbusters II).",Ghostbusters

It is not the old Ghostbusters, but with women, so if you were hoping for that, I guess you would be disappointed. What it is though, is a funny and entertaining reinvention of the original film. There is no Peter Venkman here and no Gozer level antagonist. Instead we get 4 very funny, very capable women, fighting one very angry, but very smart man, who is more than capable of wreaking havoc on New York City.

I can see why all the fuss from fans of the original or people who just don't like having their money spent seeing something that turns out to be garbage like this.I can't give this more than one star.

It's sad that all the misogyny and outpouring of hate following its release means there's unlikely to be a follow up.",Ghostbusters
1331,DarkTurnip,Really enjoyable,8,13 August 2016,"Having read a lot of bad reviews, I was expecting the worst from this movie. To my surprise, the film is actually good. Hemsworth is great in a comedic role - didn't think he would pull it off! Well done to all actresses. You really can't go wrong with these ladies and I was not disappointed! I think they do the Ghost Busters franchise proud with this movie! Laughed loads and found the story quite good! Don't pay much attention to the reviews, go see it and make up your own mind! I do feel a lot of people went into the cinema wanting to hate this. It's a different story, it obviously resembles the original, but it has a new, fresh take on it!",Ghostbusters
1332,Jordanmagill,"Suck It, Trolls",10,15 July 2016,"This movie is a riot. The disparity between its critical reception and its online reputation should be noted. It's clear most of the reviews on this site were written before users watched the film, as it just premiered.Performances are on point, stakes are appropriately emotional, and everyone is given a chance to shine. Plenty of winks to the original, for old fans, although it's by no means inaccessible to new fans.It's not a perfect film per se, but it is as enjoyable as any I've seen this year. 10 stars might be a bit of an exaggeration, but no more so than all the 1 star reviews.Stay for the whole credit sequence. It's treat after treat.For future reference, before you trash a film, make sure to watch it.",Ghostbusters
1333,kllnrstn,Very Important,10,31 July 2016,"I'm writing this review because I felt it was necessary after seeing the overall rating for it. Ever since this movie was announced it's been controversial for so many different reasons. It's been a target for racists and men who just love to degrade women. Many fans of the original movie were crying out about the sanctity of their childhood. I'm a huge fan of the original, it's been one of my favorite movies since I was little. I understand the feeling of nostalgia that comes along with something so near and dear to your heart.I expected this movie to be bad. To be fair, it's not like it's the best movie ever made. It's not necessarily good, technically speaking. I wasn't sure that I even wanted to go see it. But a friend of mine invited me to go with her and offered to pay for my ticket, so I agreed. The first ten minutes or so of the movie was sort of painful, like how I expected. The rest of the movie makes up for that painful ten minutes for so many reasons.If you don't laugh at the comedy in this movie, I feel sorry for you because you must have a lot of stress or negative things going on in your life. This movie is so lighthearted and goofy, something that I think is incredibly important considering everything that's happened in the world this year. It's not as if it's the greatest comedy ever made, or even of the year, but it will take your mind off of everything bad going on and make you laugh if you let it.My biggest point though is the characters themselves, and just how important they are as role models. They are normal women. They do silly things, they flirt, they make mistakes, they have hobbies and passions and they do all of these things while supporting each other. For little girls to be able to see a movie where, for once, women aren't perfect or angelic or seductive or dumbed down or sexualized overtly or constantly being catty to each other is incredibly important. This brings me to my next point: Chris Hemsworth. A lot of men are complaining that his character was created to make all men seem like big dumb idiots who women just want to use for their sexual fantasies. Congratulations, they finally have a sliver of understanding of what it's like for women in almost every blockbuster movie. Regardless of this though, they are reading FAR too much into it. Chris Hemsworth's character is not dumb because he's a man. Never once was there a ""Look at how stupid all men are"" joke. Chris Hemsworth's character is stupid because that's just how the character was created. As far as Chris Hemsworth being sexualized, when one character becomes infatuated with him, the other characters point out just how ridiculous she's being. There's no patting on the back or ""go get 'em's"" or anything of the sort. They explain just how ridiculous it is to over sexualize someone. Personally, I had a blast when I saw this movie, which definitely came as a surprise to me because I expected I wouldn't like it at all. There are people who haven't even seen the movie who are giving one star reviews, which is something that ticks me off. If you don't want to go see the movie, don't go see the movie. But don't rate something you haven't seen. If you want to rate something, go see it. It's not that hard. As far as preserving the sanctity of the old movie and all of our childhoods go, this one does just fine. It's a remake in concept, but not in plot or characters. This movie is not trying to replace the original, it's trying to pay homage to it, hence the appearance of the original actors (all except for Rick Moranis, which is really the only crime this movie can be accused of). They wouldn't have agreed to their cameo's if they didn't support the movie. This movie's creation is not the end of the world, or even of anyone's childhood. It's fun, it's goofy, it's not meant to be taken seriously. If, one day, those of you who claim that you hate the movie without even having gone to see it decide that maybe you will watch it, I hope you're pleasantly surprised just like I was. If you're not, then that's okay because everyone has different tastes. Go ahead and pop in the original and enjoy reliving that part of your childhood, just like how in twenty years from now, some people may be doing the same for this one.",Ghostbusters
1334,philiphilia,Don't waste your time,1,23 July 2016,"I rarely write reviews but I can't pass this one quietly. Why would anybody would like to revive a classic if they don't have something nice to put on it? Pringles, Starbucks, Reddit, Youtube, Facebook placement on your face in the first 30 minutes (I didn't watch the rest), filled with so-called meta-jokes, jokes on jokes or anticipations get weary after 2nd time. I immediately thought that this could be a Hillary Clinton campaign video. There's nothing in it. Can't even scratch the surface of entertainment. You call this a comedy? Hollywood at its worst!

I tried to watch it 3 times, and couldn't get past half an hour. I think when they started breaking into song was the last straw, it had to go. I would rather rub lemons in my eyes for 2 hours than watch this again. Maybe if you were 5 years old, you may find this amusing, but just watch the original and skip this one.Just think about all the people you could get off the street for $160,000,000 rather than produce this rubbish.",Ghostbusters
1336,jcoax-874-957752,Really Fun Ghostbusters Movie,8,31 October 2016,"I really enjoyed this. The cast was incredible. The four leads are great. (Kate McKinnon is one of the funniest people on earth.) But every supporting cast member was also great. It reminded me of the original Muppet movies, where around every corner was a quality cameo. It was full of great nods to the original and did a great job of being it's own thing. It's a great film for the whole family. It was fun and that's what a movie like this should be.Side Note: In reading some of the other reviews, there's clearly a troll brigade on the loose. The idea that movie is ""anti man"" is ridiculous. The tiny-minded worms that are pushing that agenda are a sad excuse for men. Anyone that is threatened by other people's successes, should probably spend a little more time figuring out why their life isn't going the way they had hoped and less time trying to pin that failure on others.",Ghostbusters

I really do think the people that are giving this movie such a low score are just fanboys of the original movies which oh my god i am as well!!

1338,maxinetilbury,Great movie and characters,8,20 July 2016,"This movie was very funny, the actresses were all great in their own ways, and the characters were smart. It's great seeing female characters being smart and funny for themselves. The male receptionist is hilarious and, i'm assuming, supposed to be an ironic gender-swap of a classic female idiot receptionist character. The character is a joke which must have flown past the heads of the people who think he made the movie a ""man-hating mess"". The hate and low rating that this movie got was obviously from people who dislike the gender-swap and/or the reboot, and I understand that that can be frustrating when you lived through and loved the original, but it does not deserve a 1/10. A 1/10 is a movie consisting of literally watching paint dry, not this awesome movie with great special effects, actresses, and characters.",Ghostbusters
1339,wcswimmerr07,Better Than Expected,7,15 July 2016,"With all the hate surrounding the movie I was expecting to see a major bomb. I was, however, pleasantly surprised. To start, the special effects were outstanding as were the sound effects. So it's worth seeing in a movie theater with the latest technology. The plot was a little thin and could have been written better. The acting was pretty good and the characters worked well together at first. Enter Leslie Jones' character. She had some funny moments but overall she over-acted and served to create a disjointed cast of characters. With that said, it didn't ruin the movie. Some of the jokes fell flat, but again it didn't ruin the movie. Speaking of over-acing, the mayor's assistant was not a good fit for that role. I also really enjoyed the cameos. Lastly, I didn't like that all of the men in the movie were portrayed as stupid or villainesque; this did not come across as funny to me. Was it as good as the original? No. Is it worth seeing in theaters? Yes. Go see it and judge for yourself.",Ghostbusters
1340,englishkinsella,My Second Favorite Ghostbusters,7,26 July 2016,"I watch the original Ghostbusters on a somewhat monthly basis. It, along with the original Die Hard, is my favorite movie. I put that aside coming into this movie.This movie is fun. SPOILERSCharacters: The main two, Melissa and Kristin, are fine with what they have. Their story really dominates the movie and I don't feel enough was done with it to warrant that end movie save that we got. I get why Kristin jumped in, but it was missing the umph that I think they wanted. The movie focused more on the group than it did the two of them. It worked for the overall movie, but the emotional beat they went to at the end fell flat for me since more time wasn't dedicated to these two. Kristin, though, plays a great straight woman to Melissa's almost over the top character. I enjoyed both in this movie. The standout for me was Leslie. She owned her role as an everyday person. She proved that book smarts aren't all that is necessary to survive. Her portrayal of Patty was great but I feel that she really didn't have a big moment like the other three characters did. She started to have one towards the end, but then she got smacked down and it was over. Kate was the character that had me going and turned me off almost simultaneously. I loved her character and how zany it was but Kate constantly looking into the camera took me out of the movie. It reminded me of SNL when she waits for the laugh. That said, she has one of the best action scenes in the movie when she pulls out her dual pistol proton guns. I absolutely loved everything about that scene. From then on (granted it was maybe 15 minutes) she could do no wrong. People are mad that the original cast didn't come back in their original roles. This wasn't an issue for me. This movie wasn't about being the original. (More on that later) The roles that each actor/actress had were great and fit with what the movie was.The Call-BacksFor the most part, the call-backs worked for me. We got a bust of Harold Ramis. Bill Murray is a skeptic of all things paranormal (and was probably the best of the cameos). Dan Aykroyd was a cab driver who drops the line ""I ain't afraid of no ghosts"". Ernie Hudson was Leslie's uncle. Annie Potts was a great hotel manager (probably my second favorite cameo). The Ozzie cameo felt out of place and completely unnecessary. The Slimer ghost was a reference to John Belushi which fell flat for me in this movie. Having Slimer joyriding around with his woman Slimer and a band of ghosts just didn't do it for me. It was there for the same reason that ""cross the streams"" was there in the original: they needed a way to win. My problem is that ""cross the streams"" will always be classic while ""shoot for the silver canisters"" is easily forgotten. The first ghost is a call-back to the librarian from the first movie and I absolutely loved it. More later. I loved the cameo that StayPuft had. Haters gonna hate, but that cameo was well done. I really don't want to ruin it. That said, the defeat of StayPuft was disappointing just from a ""how did she get there so fast"" point of view. Finally, there were small nods in the dialogue to the first two movies. These were blink and you would miss it moments, but they made the movie a bit more enjoyable for me.GhostsFor the most part, the ghosts were well done. I was worried since the trailers made the ghosts out to be something from Disney. The ghosts weren't entirely frightening, but they were well done. The first ghost, the woman in the house, was probably my favorite. She was a call back to the librarian from Ghostbusters and it worked. She was spooky and she was vicious. As I said, Slimer didn't do much for me. He wasn't the only one, though. The second major ghost was a dragon thing. It started off well enough with a mannequin following Leslie around, but the dragon ghost just didn't do anything for me. All of the non-human-esque ghosts were a let down in this movie. It made the movie feel more like the cartoon than a live action movie. The final ghost (the one who was misconstrued for the StayPuft and also the one who people complain gets shot in the junk) was a bit too over the top for me. The big bad is the ghost from the Ghostbusters' logo. It's an interesting idea, but I felt that this ghost and the whole finale were just too big for what the rest of the movie was. Yes, this ghost gets shot in the junk with proton blasts. No, it does not ruin the movie.StoryThe story was a bit too light for me. There are two main stories: 1. Melissa and Kristin's strained relationship and 2. The person trying to open the rift between our world and the next world. The idea for the antagonist is good, but it is not played out well at all. With all of the ghostbusting, both stories seem to take a back seat. I never really felt animosity between Melissa and Kristin and I never really felt scared that anything bad was actually going to happen. Everything else in this movie would be an 8 from me, but the story kind of dragged it down. The story had its funny beats, though. I won't ruin any of the jokes here but I will say that the trailers didn't show anything that this movie actually has. It is not as good as the first, but it is so far beyond anything the second could offer.",Ghostbusters
1341,luckdragon82,You're better off watching the original Ghostbusters instead of this farce.,1,13 March 2017,"How could someone green-light this movie from just the writing alone? I knew this was a horrible movie going in, and yet I still tried to watch it. All I could handle was the first 20 minutes before I shut it off and returned to watching the original Ghostbusters and Ghostbusters-2. You know what the biggest difference between the original movies and this horrible excuse for a movie? The first 20 minutes of the original two movies were fun, interesting, and not over-the-top with obscenities, sexism, or had any jokes that came close to talking about anything on the level of queefing in a ""family"" movie. In fact, this movie had a LOT of raunchiness that the original two movies never had. You have to be desperate to find any level of raunchiness in the original Ghostbusters movies. The closest thing that people could call ""raunchy"" was in ""Ghostbusters 2"" in the scene where Janine Melnitz begins hitting on Louis Tully. That whole segment was the most sexually explicit scene of either of the two movies, yet it was still tame in comparison to the references made inside the first 25 minutes of this schlock adaptation.",Ghostbusters
1342,quadrophenia9,Not quite as bad as you've heard,4,14 October 2021,"I will preface by saying I am white, male, and Ghostbusters was the most important thing in my life before the age of 10. At first I was infuriated to learn they were remaking Ghostbusters and boycotted the movie. After a few years I decided to give it a chance. It was not nearly as bad as I was led to believe. It had fun moments, and the visuals of the big battle at the end were pretty impressive. But there were three critical flaws:1. I did not laugh. Not once. Not at all.2. The villain was utterly forgettable. It almost seemed like they forgot to have a villain until they were about 3/4 of the way through filming, and just shoehorned in a generic NPC.3. Leslie Jones was unspeakably cringy. Particularly the big ""Zuul"" reveal at the end.So overall, not good by any stretch, but not the girl-power woke-a-thon some on the right would lead you to believe. Worth a watch on a rainy Saturday, if for no other reason than to know what you are mad about.",Ghostbusters
1343,carlosdelbrey,Unintelligent Over-rushed mess with Great 3D *Spoilers,4,14 July 2016,"Just got back. First off, I tried to be subjective, but you can't help yourself but to compare it to the original. First off, yes I am a fan of the original. That's where this movie happens to go wrong. It's like watching a bad karaoke song. IT took me a bit to figure out one word that would describe this movie, and the perfect word is ""Unintellegent"" So I'll start off with the positive. Effects A++ This is a pure 3D movie. It was designed 3D and not just fake 3D like all other movies that claim to be 3D. This explains all the colors and goofy ghosts they created that are in the commercials. They used the Black bars on the top and bottom perfectly for that extra proton effect or ghost flying around the room. If it wasn't for the almost strip scene credits at the end (I'll explain later), the 3D ride during that was almost worth sticking around. But, That's it for the positive. soooo here we go... Humor F------ This movie is the 3 stooges. Again, I have to compare to the original. What made the original was the type of intelligent humor they used. For Example. Ghostbuster 1984 Ray ""You'll never regret this Ray."" Peter ""My Parents left me that house, i was born there."" Ray ""You're not going to lose the house, everyone has 3 mortgages these days."" Peter ""But at 19 percent interest? You didn't even bargain with the guy."" Ghostbuster 2016 This one was a bunch of cliché one liners that wasn't even funny! Example ""Is it a black thang....."" from the commercial < this is the entire movies humor. Story: D- I liked that they tried/attempted to create a bit of a different story, but it failed. Once again comparing to the original. The time-lapse in the 1984 movie felt like the Ghostbusters had been around for Months with Montages they created in the first and second movie showing off all their successes and how they became loved by the city. The 2016 version somehow feels like everything happened within a week or less. Somehow within this week they got together, created a business and saved the city. The villain was a super smart goofy guy who got picked on in school and he wanted payback so he sets up little ghost charge around certain parts of the city which are ghostly tectonic plates. Yes, that's the story. That's just plain dumb. The Ghosts C+ In 1984, when I watched the librarian scene for the first time, I couldn't sleep for a week. Now I laugh at it, but it was convincing then. There was a build up to it (referring to the walkthrough of the library) that climaxed to the ""OMFG"" moment when you see the ghost. 2016 - Perhaps the use of CGI did it, It all looked like cheesy Halloween ghosts you see around the neighborhood. Overall - 4/10 Again, it has the unfortunate circumstance of being compared to the original. I like the cameos from all the originals minus Miranis and the late Harold Ramis, but you can tell they were just there to support the franchise. In the end Murray gets the final laugh with his ever-wanted Death scene in Ghostbusters. If the original didn't exist, maybe a 5/10 would have better, but I have to compare it. I wasn't impressed with Chris Hemsworth as other reviewers has mentioned. I did chuckle a few times, but I did the same watching 3 Stooges. Disappointed isn't the right word. How can Rotten Tomatos have this thing up so high is beyond me. To address The ""attack on Men"" piece. Like every other review says, it does insult men in general. Maybe it's payback for all the females in every Michael Bay movie. It doesn't really bother me, but it's more than obvious. It's a movie truly designed for the ladies, (or for some of those few guys), especially with the ""Magic Mike XXL"" credits that ""Thor"" does at the end. I mean really?",Ghostbusters
1344,trekkie-103-136632,A fun summer film,7,11 December 2016,"The reviews are skewed on this film because of petulant children.I was unable to see this in the theater, but finally had a chance to watch it. The film stands on it's own, and Holtzman is a stand out character which I loved.This is nothing more than the base pretense of the original film that involves ghosts and new york, other than that it's an entirely new story with new characters. It's not some intensely thought out story and plot, it's a dumb summer movie and it did a decent job of being that.There were some fine nods to the previous movie with some great cameos, but all in all this is not a 1 star film, and it's not a ten star film. It's a fun summer blockbuster film with some great jokes that a bunch of angry basement dwellers got mad at and set out to ruin.I hated the new theme song, they should have either stuck with a slightly modified original, or done something new. mashing it up as a fall out boy song ruined it. Fortunately, it barely plays in the film. I wish they'd written Helmsworth's character better as it wasn't funny, it was just annoying/sidetracking. They could have done better instead of phoning it in and not answering it (see what I did there).",Ghostbusters

Then came all the negative reviews and sounds from social media about the reboot. Finally decided to watch this with my boyfriend and we both really liked it. The cast is really funny and apart from some snickering through out the movie, we really laughed out loud a couple of times. The movie came together really well for the nearly 2 hours that it lasts. The action, CGI, jokes and acting form a perfect action/comedy blockbuster, nothing more, nothing less.

Even though it was a remake, I was expecting something way better than this film. I don't care about the fact that now the main characters, I'm totally fine with it, it can be taken as a fresh start. But, seriously, I felt like I was watching a chick flick... it looked like Bridemaids with the Ghostbusters title because of the repeated jokes (some were funny, but it got bored at times). And, about the male character, I don't recall the secretary of the original film to be THAT stupid. So, I guess is just the way it had always been with Hollywood and its remakes, to ruin the original idea and love the original even more, and thanking that there are still great directors with bright and fresh ideas.My advice, don't waste your time unless you are a big (HUGE) fan of Kristen Wiig.",Ghostbusters
1347,MightyGreenTallest,Not Awful but not Great either...,6,17 July 2016,"There are little spoilers throughout this review -- YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.When the ""controversy"" is all said and done, the movie is not bad as bad as the naysayers would want you to believe (ONE star? Are you kidding?! C'mon! It's not THAT bad!). It was a bit sluggish at parts and not all jokes hit bullseye... BUT it was enjoyable enough of the time. I didn't mind the CGI because that was never the main focus to begin with(as far as GB movies go). This movie FEELS like a GBs movie. Main Cons:-The pacing could've been better, like I said. Felt like some scenes were left out just for time.-Not much development from the main two leads (Melissa McCarthy and Kristen Wiig's characters more specifically). Could've had more scenes for those characters to reconnect.-Mistreatment of characters: I will KIND'A agree that most of the male characters (minor or otherwise) are presented as jerks or are idiots... or both (this is a 22-year-old woman pointing this out; mind you). -The marketing and backlash handling was bad... And that's what ruins the movie for most other people. The first trailers come out and BOOM people hated it. And then starts the uproar of tumblr feminists overreacting (as usual) to the hate. Which gets the cast and crew involved in the drama and did NOT make the situation, in any way, better...Main Pros: -The characters were different but good enough on their own. Holtz, Patty, and Kevin steal the show. Holtz is a quirky scientist who has a bizarre sense of humor and the main inventor of the GB's tech. Patty is our new Winston but even more helpful. She knows New York City inside and out and knows the history of it as well, which was a really good move character and story wise. She was also very funny. Kevin is a dumb but lovable new receptionist of the GB's HQ. And is only there to look pretty and get kidnapped (i.e by possession). Which would be negative for most people, but I just find it hilarious. -The story is its own(and should be judged as such). This is a reboot but not a word-for-word one. And it tries to have its own story. There is no sense of any character wanting to become a GB for money or fame(the closest thing would be recognized as NOT being crazy), just a straightforward pursuit for knowledge. And in doing so, a mystery unravels. An evil plot to engulf the city with ghosts is revealed. Characters are reunited and some are introduced. I like the ending. When all the characters are on the roof seeing the city's appreciation for saving them. I hope that in the sequel, it won't come down to ""Oh! We caused a lot of damage to the city in first one so now we're hated again""(which really made no sense in the original 2nd film, to be honest).My finishing thoughts: I liked it. It was an OK movie. Just that. There are problems sure, but those mostly stem from before the movie was released. I ask you please, DO NOT buy into the social media drama surrounding the movie. See it for yourself and make your OWN judgments about the movie. Thanks for reading. :)",Ghostbusters

The film flowed well, at no point did I feel bored. The CGI was fine - obviously not going to be scarily realistic ghosts as its going for the family feel rather than thriller.Don't understand the hate this film is getting.

Anyway the problem with this trying to be the scary movie of ghostbusters is that ghostbusters has some good comedy too. So some people actually think that this trash from 2016 is trying to be like Ghostbusters. This movie should not be named ghostbusters tho because its just cheap slapstick with some actually not so bad jokes but those can pretty much bought in Hollywood and just added in.

As many has stated before, the old movies are classic and that's what they should be. I went in with expectations that this new one was going to be a remake, but got surprised that it mostly wasn't. Sure, you had the classical lead - this time all female - with the obligatory dark-skinned actor, but to me it didn't matter. The four characters were all shaped in a unique way which in turned just added to the interactions. Not to mention their funny secretary (who doesn't love an attractive, but slightly dumb guy?). The ghosts were nicely shaped and you got to see a bit of nostalgia from the classical movies. I didn't laugh all the time, but most of it. It's a perfect film when you can't care to think too much about plots and just want a ride for the evening. I'm saying bravo for making a pretty good remake!",Ghostbusters

Screenplay is awful. SFX looks like it was taken from the 2009 video game.The actors seem to be doing the best they can but their roles are shocking, especially Chris Hemsworth who was character is actually offensive, basically supposed to be the male equivalent of a bimbo but comes across as someone with massive learning difficulties with no support or charm.As for the cameo's, they look bored and doing it just to fulfil contractual obligations. Do yourselves a favour and just watch the original.",Ghostbusters
1352,elspeth87,I loved every second of this film,10,21 July 2016,"From the opening sequence to the end credits I was hooked on this film. It was wonderful. I have read reviews that were less than complementary, but they could not have been more wrong. I laughed throughout. The four lead actresses were fantastic and Chris Hemsworth was a delight. There were enough references to the original to pay tribute the fantastic films that have come before, but it also stood firmly on its own two feet. It was NOT a remake of the first two, and I would question whether or not anyone saying that had indeed seen all three films. The cameos were a great homage, but the characters were their own. I cannot praise this film highly enough. Well done to all involved.",Ghostbusters

They throw in as many references as possible for fans of the original, in a desperate forced fashion.2) Jokes. The 'jokes' are constant one liners, and it's impossible to go two minutes without someone making a terrible quip. The humor is incredibly forced, the characters may as well be staring into the camera say ""See, we're funny. It's a funny movie. Isn't it?"". It's something you expect on a sitcom accompanied by a laugh track to mask the sound of crickets and failure.3) Cameos. Cameos are great, provided they're not just slapping you in the face screaming ''LOOK! LOOK! IT'S THAT PERSON YOU KNOW!''. The only well done cameo was Bill Murray. The rest where just a painfully forced and insulting way to try to appeal to original fans.4) Characters. I should say walking tropes instead of characters. Ahem. One highly educated female professor that is reduced to a lust-struck airhead teenager around Chris Hemsworth? Check! One fat chick who's main recurring gag is that she didn't get enough Wantons. Check! One sassy black woman, whose inability to use grammar is only matched by her ability to start every sentence with ''Y'all''? Check! One ridiculously quirky parody of a mad scientist that loves to blow everything up?

I heard the back and forth between people on both sides of the argument.I still went into watching this with an open mind, after all McCarthy and Wiig have made great funny movies in the past, Paul Fieg has directed good movies. Chris Hemsworth is one of the hottest actors on the scene today. So I thought it can't be as bad as they're making out.I was wrong, so SO wrong.Let me say it's not the fault of the cast, they try their best but whoever wrote this godawful script with literally zero humor needs to never be allowed anywhere near screenplays again. Who actually read this screenplay and actually thought it was something worth shooting, let alone dropping 150 mill on it?There is no humor, there is no effort, there is no character development. It's the same one dimensional jokes pounded into the ground over and over and over and over. Kate McKinnon's character is the crazy one. Leslie Jones is the black one. Chris Hemsworth is the dorky himbo. Kirsten Wiig has got a schoolgirl crush on Hemsworth. IT. NEVER. STOPSI tried. I tried so hard to find one positive, just ONE thing that I liked. The best I could come up with was Ernie Hudson's cameo. That is how bad this movie is, where you see the original cast and you realize you wasted $15 this pile of crap when you could have stayed home and watched the original.Don't watch this. For the love of god don't watch this. There is no directing, there is no coherent storyline, there is no character development, there is no redeeming factor for any of this. There is pain. Only Pain.

Myself, husband and 21 yr old son watched it after dinner...I should probably say that we have the two original films, which have been watched over and over again.I wasn't sure about the film to start with - perhaps it was the brashness of Abigail and weirdness of Jillian, slightly unusual types over here - but we always make a point of watching films to the end (even the atrocious Independence Day: Resurgence...) And as the action progressed we all found ourselves thoroughly enjoying it.No, it's not a great film, but then, neither were the originals. It followed the format of the first original enough to feel familiar, with enough differences to make us chuckle. We loved that the women were wonderfully ORDINARY (as in not skinny model types but women all women can relate to: makes a hell of a change!), and it was great to see Hemsworth in such a funny role! (Such a change from Thor...) We loved the homages to the original characters too - it's a pity Rick Moranis didn't want a cameo, as I'd have loved to see him in it.Overall, just great fun. A terrific way to end a horribly wet, stormy Monday, and we will enjoy watching it again to pick up on all the little details we missed first time around.We really, REALLY hope there's a sequel or two.",Ghostbusters

It's so bad it goes beyond the concept of bad movies - you don't get any pleasure in watching this idiotic screenplay, hearing the idiotic dialogues and watching a great idea like the Ghostbusters desecrated and demolished.I watched till the end and seriously believe the producers and especially the writers should be banned from ever coming close to making movies. I am disgusted.What made me so angry? - sexism, stupid, primitive sexism, emanating from the dialogues - and let's make it straight - it's that stupid man sexism, just translated to be spoken by women. Just WTF? - a lot of pseudo-scientific non-sense spoken by the characters, not even pretending to make it realistic. You can obviously see, that the writers didn't care what they're creating. - making the ghostbusters into some stupid Bollywood-style action movie, were they're making absurd weapons and ""killing"" ghosts. The final scene is absolutely idiotic. - the winks to the original movies was the saddest part, this is a reboot, not a continued universe, so you see the original Ghostbusters in some absolutely stupid side-roles.

Where the antogist is so powerful he can mearly click his fingers to stop the whole US army but when the ghostbusters shows up he allows himself to be defeated. Female Egon invents all sorts of new ghost fighting wepons that no one asked for. I feel that if you say ghostbusters is a bad movie people assume your sexist, but come on did you actually watch this pile of crap.
Even if they was placed by the original actors it is still a bad movie. The plot is like a uncontrolable dream that goes on random tangents, it makes no sense.
The whole movie feels like the director just wants to spin propaganda about womens rights, but there is a time and place for that and it should not manys fravorate childhood movie franchise, all this movie has done is possible set back the idea of all women movies for the future.Its not ok to disgrace any race or gender in a movie for entertainment purposes.",Ghostbusters

All the pointless cameos and references to the original to try and bolster a plot that wasn't very strong and took away from the development of interesting characters.

Way too many people out there want to try and view this as maybe a 'sequel-ish' kind of film or some kind of commentary on society. Just stay away from that BS!This show is meant to be a comedy and it succeeds very well on that mark! The original was full of similar kinds of 'groaner' type jokes, with people in the theater when it came out just laughing their asses off at them. This movie has a multitude of moments like that! It's a great comedy with more than enough 'winks' at the original to make it perfect!If you watch this as a MOVIE, then you won't be disappointed. But, then again, comedy is a subjective thing, so your mileage may vary.

Absolutely loved Holtzmann especially. They kept it true to the original, and improved it in SO many ways! this new Ghost busters has a great story line, and a scary villain.

Cannot wait to buy the movie when it comes out on DVD! I have recommended everyone go and see it and make their own assumptions instead of listening to hateful reviews that are actually very wrong. This movie had me entertained the entire way through, not only was it adventurous, funny and scary but it felt original, and that's HUGE in this day and age, where so many movies feel plastic and re written. They kept it true to ghost busters, and true to the new technology of this day. AWESOME WORK GUYS. everybody go and see it!! I already wanna see it again and I saw it last night.

I liked the little nods to the original (no spoilers as there are some great jokes that come from subverting your expectations) but the story was fairly original. Sure, it hit some of the same notes as the first movie but probably less so than Jurassic World or The Force Awakens) - pretty sure it's more or less the story they would have used had it been a straight sequel. On a less positive note, the effects seemed pretty lame - more like something out of a haunted house at a theme park, and the proton packs etc looked like laser-tag toys. I also found the ""science"" a little muddled - sometimes they trapped ghosts, sometimes they destroyed them, other times they ""killed"" them. It's like they hadn't quite decided what a ""ghost"" was as such and were taking several cues from Men in Black. I suppose kids will enjoy the action scenes but the inconsistency took me out of the story a little. The science of the original may have been completely made up but at least it was consistent. Also in the minus column - Slimer. Including him was obviously meant to please us older fans and, to an extent, it did but if you're trying to play on people's nostalgia, why give him a deep, throaty voice rather than the voice we expect from the cartoon? Okay, I know his voice was kinda deeper in the first movie but we all know how we expect Slimer to sound - why not meet that expectation? Even with these negatives, however, I greatly enjoyed the movie. Okay, it may never become a classic but it was good fun as movies like this are supposed to be!",Ghostbusters
1376,dlp65,Who You Gonna Call? Someone Else...,1,24 September 2016,"This is the worst reboot I've paid money for in a long time. Growing up, I adored the 1984 version and wanted so very badly for this to be great. And instead, I got a CGI filled, hilariously not-hilarious train-wreck with absolutely no redeeming qualities. Scratch that, it had 2 redeeming qualities. What were they? Zach Woods and the attempt (note I said attempt, as it will be mentioned later) at an empowering message. Zach Woods stole the show for me. Want to ask who Zach Woods is? He was the tour guide in the opening scene! Why did he steal the show? He told me in the first 5 minutes of this movie how awful things would be. Not only was this poorly acted, but the story is rushed and paced differently throughout. With a horrible premise lining up with another ""Ghost Invasion"" the writers felt they could deliver on the old franchise expectations. And they failed miserably. Hollywood decided that while cashing in on the beloved franchise; which they failed to do by the way, seeing as the box office returns are a projected 120 million while the investment was 140 million; they would also insert ""Girl Power"" as part of the story-line. And as someone wholly against Third Wave Feminism, not for its message, but because it is wholly unnecessary in American Society that is baseless and completely unnecessary, I very nearly vomited at the mere premise. Don't get me wrong. I believe women should be empowered. But crying out for rights you've had since August 18th, 1920 is not the way to do it. But, the Feminism wasn't the problem with this movie. In fact, its quite the opposite. A seemingly empowering message to young women everywhere that women can accomplish amazing things might have been a redeeming thing about this movie. Except it isn't. Speaking to multiple friends and even just other viewers at the theaters, most young women I spoke with said this let them down, as they expected something more inspiring and instead found themselves laughing at the entire message due to poor delivery and cliché. From poor acting to a poor soundtrack, this could not have been done any more distastefully. I don't care that the story was centered around women. I care that the story had nothing to go off of in the first place. Attempting to reboot a series that is so treasured by millions and then delivering a train-wreck like this should be a crime. Speaking as someone who usually enjoys even the most pandering of movies, and as someone who will tolerate next to anything film wise, I have to say this was the most horrid film I have seen in the past 3 years.

1378,andy-vanderwerk,Waste of time for fans of the original.,1,20 July 2016,"What can I say about this film!!I was skeptical about this film, and to a certain extend I was totally against it coming out. Had this been a third movie 10 years ago, with the original four it might have had a far different outcome.Despite my initial cynicism, I decided to give it a go with an open mind. The reality after the first 30mins began to hit me. It was as bad as if feared, I felt like this was an insult to the original franchise. Like many others maybe they should have left this alone.I'm not saying women shouldn't play the lead roles, nor this was an anti-male theme, but I can see what people are saying. Very cleverly hidden in the context of the film, you felt this was clearing throwing the strong, independent women of today into your face. The male secretary was as thick as a plank, again made you feel like he couldn't be of greater intelligence and that men were significantly inferior.The jokes you wanted to laugh at, were overall awful. Again American comedy was not the issue, as I've found this type of humour funny in the past (the American office for example). They also tried to constantly every other sentence throw in a joke, a quip or sarcastic remark, it fell flat on most occasions, and in our movies theater you could often hear sarcastic laughing or snorts of derision.It was for the majority a copy of some points in the original, maybe they should have just gone for something completely new. Again it was this type of repetition, along with the lame jokes that could make you want to walk towards the exit.... Yes I felt like leaving.To summarise for new people to the franchise, families etc may enjoy this. It's far from the worst film ever seen. That said for the hardcore fans, north of 25 years old who grew up with this film, I'd suggest you save your time and money there's no joy to be found here. The two hours it sucks away from your life could be better filled maybe having your teeth extracted by tying a rope to your car bumper and driving off.Shocking sequel, an insult to the original films!!",Ghostbusters
1379,annilator86,Worst Franchise Reboot Ever Made *SPOILER ALERT*,1,11 July 2016,"I was unfortunate enough to see an early screening with a friend and... man, this movie isn't bad; it's TERRIBLE. BEYOND TERRIBLE. It's getting mixed to positive reviews, but the people liking this movie are the same people who jumped on-board the feminist ""everyone who hates this film is a misogynist"" train and they don't even mention anything beyond the parts they cherry-picked to like in the movie. Throughout the hour and a half + movie, the movie made a desperate attempt to be good to the point where it just appeared like they were trying too hard. Much of the humor is forced and most of the jokes are basic and can be seen/guessed even before the scene rolls. At times, it felt cheap and lazy. I thought I was watching a failing SNL parody rather than a good movie.Leslie Jones is another problem; she portrays a stereotypical black woman with an attitude. Yelling? Check. Bitch slapping? Check. Every single stereotype about black woman? Check. Remember Winston Zeddemore from the original film? Was he a stereotypical black man at the time in the 1980s? Nope. Instead, he was an Average Joe who wanted a job and took it at Ghostbusters. Here, Leslie portrays her character in an almost-offensive manner when it comes to playing a stereotypical black woman. It's borderline inappropriate and, had she been a man, this film would've been TRASHED by critics for this portrayal of a character. Also, it's Reverse Sexism in a film. Instead of treating both genders equally, Paul Feig displays men as idiots or assholes. This is true with Hemsworth's character, Kevin, who is the team's secretary. He's completely stupid, clueless and innocent; but mostly stupid. Janine in the original film was a smart, capable woman who had a lot of memorable moments and wasn't portrayed in a sexist, if not really unattractive manner. I almost walked out of the early screening because of how poorly men were portrayed in the film. And, probably, by now, everyone has heard of the atrocious final resolution to the final battle. SPOILER ALERT: SKIP IF YOU WANNA ACTUALLY SEE THIS BURNING DUMPSTER FIRE.The final battle is resolved by shooting Rowan in the dick. That's right; four chicks shoot Rowan in the dick with their proton packs. -.- You probably already know this because of the GIF floating around the inter-webs, but, yeah. That's how the final battle ends; a really sexist approach to finishing the film. It sounds mild, but combine this with the portrayal of Kevin, Bill Murray's cameo and a few other male characters who interact with the main characters and you have a feminist film ready to go.Along with these criticisms come with the really bad script that just acts like imitation crab in the food world; it's just an imitation. In fact, half the plot imitates the original in a distasteful manner that just really turns off Ghostbusters fans. It's unoriginal and it pays little homage to the films. When it does, it does it in lackluster fashion. Like, for example, Stay Puft's official sighting in this film is in parade balloon form, not true marshmallow form. If you were expecting at least one showdown with the destructive Puft himself, think again. He has been replaced by the logo ghost. XD There's so much wrong with this movie, but these things are just a few of them. Thanks Paul Feig for messing Ghosbusters up. I guess Paul's been Busted and it felt good busting' this travesty of a film that will haunt GB fans for generations.PROS: -Chris Hemsworth (For the most part) -Complete relief when the film endedCONS: -Terrible acting -Abismal writing -Huge gaping plot holes (Like the inability to buy the firehouse but the ability to create advanced ghost busting technology and obtain parts and equipment.) -Poor CGI effects -Disrespectful cameos and treatment of original material -Reverse sexist message -A stereotypical caricature of a black woman (Leslie Jones as Patty) -Useless inclusion of Patty into the GB team -Non-existent character chemistry -Disappointing final battle which breaks all GB rules first established in the film -Unmemorable soundtrack -Poor editing -Inappropriate responses to constructive criticism hidden in film -Dull, ineffective, dry forced-humor -Identity crisis (Reboot or Sequel.

1381,wolfben,Disappointed,3,26 July 2016,"I didn't think the trailer was very good but still went to see it and ended up even more disappointed. There was only a couple things in the movie that could possibly make you chuckle and all of those parts are in thetrailers but that is really about it. Also they only busted one ghost until the very end. But I do have to say the production and special-effects are amazing in this movie and I like the small changes to the jumpsuits, but the special-effects is the only reason I didn't give it a one star rating. I should have trusted my first response to the trailer and stayed far away from this movie, destroyed the ghost busters entirely! If you loved the older films just re watch them. But If you want to waist 2 hours of your life on this go ahead but take mine and this movies 5.4 review as a warning.",Ghostbusters
1382,foxvideo1996,Very Bloody. Bloody awful if you ask me.,1,29 November 2016,"Do you remember in An American Werewolf In London where David has that nightmare where those ""nazi demons"" kill his family and then kill him? Do you remember in The Big Lebowski where those thugs peed on The Dude's rug? Those things represent my experience watching the Ghostbusters reboot. Now before I get into my review, I'm going to discuss my experience with the original 1984 classic and it's 1989 sequel. The original from 1984 is one of my all time favorite movies between E.T. and Beetlejuice. I have seen the original movie pretty much every way imaginable. I have seen it on VHS, DVD, TV, and Netflix. I even saw it on the big screen at the Fox Theater at the end of my summer vacation last year. That experience almost had me in tears, because I had seen it on the small screen about a million times. Now as for Ghostbusters II, I've only seen it on VHS and DVD. I actually enjoyed it even though others didn't. Now all that would change for me in late 2014. One of my teachers in high school(who shall remain anonymous) who knew I loved Ghostbusters told me that they were rebooting Ghostbusters with an all female cast. I thought the guy was joking and I blew it off. Then in when the trailer premiered on YouTube, one of my friends showed me the trailer during 5th period. I blew it off, initially. But then 2 months later, I watched the trailer a few more times and I realized that this trailer was horrible. Then I saw the comments and other YouTube videos on the subject. That really changed my mind on this movie. For the longest time, I refused to see the movie. Then I changed my mind when the Blu-ray came out. I snagged that Blu-ray disc and popped it in my Blu-ray player. That is when my childhood experience of the 1984 Ghostbusters went up in flames. I should note before I go any further that the Blu-ray provides the both the theatrical version and an extended version. I only watched the theatrical version for this review.Now here's what I thought of this movie: it was horrible. The jokes sucked, the characters sucked, everything about this movie sucked. The actresses I could tell were in misery doing this movie. It could also tell that this was a troubled production. It could be like Jaws (which had an even more troubled production than this) and be a classic. But it wasn't speaking of which. There is was Jaws joke which I can't remember at this point. Anyway, the CGI effects in this movie are horrible. It makes the practical effects in the first two movies look like a low budget Troma movie. The effects are basically what would happen if you take the CGI effects from the live action Scooby Doo movies and Disney's The Haunted Mansion and put them together in a blender. Here are some better movies with practical effects that still hold up well: John Landis' An American Werewolf In London. That transformation scene still holds up well to this day. That movie even caused Rick Baker to win an Oscar. It even created a new category that year for Best Makeup effects. How about John Carpenter's The Thing? That chest defibrillation scene still looks well today. Try David Cronenberg's remake of The Fly. That effect of Brundlefly vomiting on the guy's hand and his hand melting off looked amazing then and still looks amazing to this day. Chris Walas also won an Oscar for that movie for make up effects. Those maybe unrelated movies but the effects in those movies hold up WAY better than the effects in this. The worst moment in this movie was the climax. It is one of the most cartoonish endings I have ever seen in the movie. It just went on and on and on. Long story short, this was an awful movie. Don't waste your time on this big pile of manure that this movie is. That is all.",Ghostbusters
1383,Samcrumpacker-931-371910,"Decent, Exceeded expectations.",6,21 July 2016,"It's a summer blockbuster, what did people expect? I have been a lifelong ghostbusters fan, I grew up with the first two movies and I go as far as to collect Ghostbusters action figures, props, shirts, video games, you name it. Don't go in with the expectation that this movie will ruin your childhood and that it will tarnish the legacy, because then you won't find ANYTHING good about this film, because nothing can compare to memory, to what you loved growing up, the nostalgia aspects. So I didn't. I came in with an open mind. Kristen Wig was great, she is just a perfect fit for the rest of the team, she just gets along great with everybody, she actually was responsible for a big laugh or two. Next is Jenny McCarthy, now here was the only member I had trouble with, ALL of her jokes fell flat, not one got a laugh from the audience, and she didn't really make an effort to stand out, she was really just there, they needed a household name, I think ghostbusters is all about showcasing the talent, and so here Melissa didn't need to stand out much because she already has a very big following. Whereas, the other three I think had more emphasis on them to do just that, showcase themselves. Kate McKinnon was decent, but her non sequitur weren't really as funny as they were supposed to be, she filled the token ""technical genius"" of the crew, just like Donatello in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, or Egon in the 1984 original. She was there more for the kids obviously, you kind of need a more zany out there type for kids to latch onto as the fan favorite, which is what she was sort of being pushed as. Leslie Jones I know has been harassed enough about the role and that honestly makes me sick, I thought she did a fantastic job, she was probably my favorite, the character has knowledge of her own, I thought she transcended the racial emphasis of the role, to the best of her ability. Now the actress did a great job, however the writers needed to lay off of this character, they did give her many loud mouthed moments and they gave her some lines that honestly made me cringe. Now while the actresses individually more or less did good jobs, as a team, it DID tend to fall apart at times. There would be moments where they are all together in a room, struggling to get a team-like feel going, but honestly the chemistry just was not there most of the time, in fact, sometimes it would get so bad, that I would just zone out for a bit, the movie just paused on these scenes with the team, and it would put the entire film on hold. The story, however, was honestly TERRIBLE. The villain especially, was just god awful. He couldn't have spelled it out anymore, he just could not have indicated that he was the villain any more loudly, from the MOMENT I saw this guy, I KNEW he was the villain. The actor too was REALLYbad, and he was just as one dimensional in person and as transparent as the terrible CGI Ghosts. Speaking of the battling, a LOT was really really terrible. The big face off at the end just could not hold my interest, even with all of the new gadgets that are supposed to bring variety could not make up for it, the ghost fighting was just soulless, it made you wonder how they got that skilled with the equipment without any scenes indicating that they trained with it or ANYTHING. There was a scene where Kate McKinnon's character introduces it, they all test it, of course to comedic effect, without any grip on the equipment, it proved to be too much for them. So then, it goes to the end of the movie, you forgot the equipment was even brought up, the scene was so Rushed, and now here they are just taking out hordes of ghosts with it. There was just no patience for the journey of becoming a better team, it felt really empty. Lastly, Chris Hemsworth was great, he just put me in a great mood, he was of course a really bad stereotype, but that smile though, it can really deceive you. I applaud them for knowing that much, getting a guy as like able as him to extinguish the fire a little bit. Overral, typical summer blockbuster, don't let it ruin ghostbusters for you, that's your own fault. I think it's ridiculous how everyone on IMDb has to give this movie a 1 rating just because, ""uhhh it's bad"". Find some good in the bad you morons, this isn't the worst movie ever made, far from it. Everyone just seems to love to jump to the gun on that ""1"" rating, so please, if you're reading this, give it at least a 4, because this movie isn't a 1. 6/10 IGN Mates",Ghostbusters

1386,brianahuggins7,More than I ever could have hoped for.,10,24 July 2016,"When I first read the announcement that there would be a Ghostbusters reboot, I was not particularly hopeful. Knowing how reboots go, I was certain that it would end where most reboots do; unliked and eventually forgotten, relegated to five dollar movie bins and late night TV showings. There was a catch, though, and the catch was what kept me interested; it was to be an all-female cast. This seemed too good to be true, and I was excited. From the first moment I realized just how furious many men were about this, I knew I was in this for the long haul, for better or worse. Many detractors would dress up their words, would find ways to make it seem like they weren't just angry because of the female cast, they were just mad that their beloved franchise was being rebooted, because how dare anyone touch a classic like Ghostbusters? But let's be honest here. No franchise is safe in Hollywood today, and far more loved films have already been touched by the remake/reboot/continue story machine. Were you aware, before this, that so many people adored Ghostbusters this much, that so many folks held this movie so dearly? I certainly wasn't. What's so different about this movie being remade that it could spark this level of vitriol? Who knows? I'm kidding. We know. We all know.So I've been waiting, ever since the first announcement was made, for this movie. Often nervous and vaguely worried that I was defending it for nothing, scared that I would see it and be let down, I kept up hope. When the first wave of reviews came out, largely positive, my hope grew. Was it possible the movie would actually live up to my own expectations? There were bad reviews, of course, and for some reason, every single one of these reviewers felt the need to FIRST specify that it WASN'T because they hate women, though this really shouldn't be something you have to specify first when you're reviewing a movie. Many of the good reviews weren't glowing, but there were still a TON of good reviews.So again, I held out hope.The movie was released, and due to circumstances, I couldn't go opening weekend. Friends did, however, and not a single one of them was disappointed. My hope grew. I went shopping for merch, just to see what was out. Target, who many have been pointing to because they discounted their Ghostbusters toys before the film ever came out, had REMOVED the discounts. You could see where they'd pulled the stickers off. That was it, for me. I had to see this movie. I got together a group of friends to see it with, and we went.I adored this film.I was struck almost immediately by how comfortable I felt, how familiar things were. Not in a bad way, but like visiting a loved one you haven't seen in ages. The characters felt like real people, the kind of folks I would know. I don't think I've ever seen female characters who felt so wholly human. There were so many unflattering shots, so many scenes where the women get to be real people, something usually reserved for male characters. The chemistry between all of the actresses was great, and again, they felt like real people with real relationships.Most importantly, I laughed almost constantly through the film, and so did the near full theater around me. I can think of one joke in the whole film that didn't work for me. The pacing worked, and in the moments where it wasn't quite what it needed to be, the humor made up for it. I can't say the special effects are, well, anything special, but even top notch CGI gets knocked for even existing, and I can't complain, because it worked. The cameos were fun, if unnecessary, though I was extremely happy with Sigourney Weaver's, and waiting to see where they'd pop up was great. The story isn't incredible, but they were playing it safe. The villain is, I think, a character that will make more sense to the women watching than he does to many of the men, and that's the thing about this whole movie, really.It's just not aimed at men.It's not made for men to like. It's not made with men in mind at all. None of the women were cast with the intent of bringing in straight male viewers, and the young, hot Ghostbuster isn't straight. The secretary position, something usually reserved as the slot in which to stick eye candy for straight male viewers, is, again, not used in their favor. This is a summer action flick that, beyond a shadow of a doubt, was not made with men in mind.It's incredible.I can't believe this movie was ever made, but it was, and I am thankful. There aren't any fat jokes. There aren't any jokes about the way the women look at all. Erin is never made to feel bad about her superficial interest in Kevin. Abby is never mocked for her (sometimes ruthless) ambition. Patty gets to be loud and funny AND super interested in weird history stuff, and no one ever gives this a second thought. Holtzmann, my personal favorite, is unapologetically strange. All of these characters get to be themselves, and no one is ever allowed to make them feel lesser for it.Is this a ten star film? No. But it's far from a one star film, and I hope the score I give it can weigh out some of the unnecessarily low ratings its being given.Go see this movie. Take your friends to see this movie. Take your mom and your sister and your cousin. It's fun. It's not a perfect film, certainly not, but neither was the original, and this is a damn solid entry in the franchise. Bring on the sequels.",Ghostbusters
1387,jell_bells91,"Great cast, lots of fun!",10,17 July 2016,"This movie was so hilarious. I laughed out loud the entire time. The comedy is classic and not at all the crude, ridiculous stuff you see in a lot of comedies these days. The script is chalk-full of great moments that the cast absolutely capitalizes on. The cast (particularly Kate McKinnon) milks every last DROP out of their performances. These ladies deliver excellent comedy alongside endearing moments of friendship. The special effects for the ghosts are strangely beautiful while also being creepy and goofy--basically, the ghosts are super cool. And the ghost-busting gadgets are bad-ass; they make the fight scenes really interesting and varied. All of this, of course, is made even better by the female empowerment that goes on the entire film! The women in this movie are intelligent, creative, brave, and POWERFUL, all while goofing around with a bunch of green slime.

The only thought right now is people say this is sexist oh and very bad movie. I will see.﻿Next comment""What? One more time I have to.﻿""Next comment""This world is insane......This movie is exactly what people have been saying. Targeted towards women. Depicting them as super heroes. So what?

It seems the men of this world cannot either. So what a movie targeted at women. Good, they need someone to look up to just like anyone else (If you want to separate into categories that is, which all business and marketing is...your target audience).I am so upset I am going to go and give 10 stars with the title ""I hate this movie""....like my other review.

Several of the jokes and interactions had me laughing in hysterics, and I heard quite a bit of laughter from surrounding movie crowd. This felt very different then the original Ghostbuster movies ( which I admittedly haven't seen in years.) But I felt like it paid homage to the original while creating its own movie that can stand by itself. Other than the actress who played Patty, I thought the chemistry and humor between the other 3 leading ladies was excellent. Being a fan of Paul Feig's comedy already, I especially loved seeing actors from some of his other work pop up... Namely Other Space. I understand that not everybody is going to like everything... And that many are ""purists"" who dislike sequels or reboots that stray too far from the source material... But for me, this was a delightfully fun movie that I did not regret spending money on to see in the theater. To call it terrible or the worst garbage ever just feels melodramatic to me.

It had enough similarities to the classics but just enough changes and fresh twists. It had a decent script. Silly enjoyable jokes. I cant really fault it.

My wife and son loved Kate Mckinnon's character, for example. I thought she had promise but came across as one dimensional. There wasn't enough detail about her personally for me to latch onto.

It strikes me that there aren't that many movies being made like this these days: a weird mash up of the '80s and today. The cheesy special effects give it a childish feel, right alongside queef jokes and some legit stunt choreography, all of which really worked for me. This team of protagonists are by turns goofy, brilliant, tender, and kickass... because people aren't one-dimensional and our heroes shouldn't be either. The editing did feel a bit clumsy to me at times; it seemed as if a lot of content had been cut and I'd love to see an extended version! I'm sure this cast of comedians was riffing the hell out of that script and that sounds like a great time to me. And yes, I want to see better representation of complex female characters in entertainment. This will make the world better and will continue to cause some strife along the way.

I thought Melissa McCarthy, Leslie Jones or Kristen Wiig would be but Kate was just magnificent. I have enjoyed her on SNL since she started. But all 4 ladies were good in their roles.

And having listened to and read many of the comments about this movie, I was certainly skeptical. Add to that the fact that I am a child of the 70s, having seen the original not only in the theater when it was released but also many times throughout my life... I was even more skeptical. With that being said, I was very pleasantly surprised by just how good this was. I saw the extended version and really enjoyed it. It was clever, funny, and a great time. Do yourself a favor... Watch the extended version (the person I saw it with had seen the theatrical version and said the extended version was considerably better from a continuity standpoint) and go in without prejudice already tainting your feelings about it. The cast is great, the acting good, and the couple of hours were definitely spent with a decent amount of laughter and enjoyment. Kate M is simply hilarious and for me she stole the show. For all the haters out there, especially the ones who hated it before seeing it, just get over yourselves. This movie isn't meant to take the place of your beloved original. Nothing ever will. That doesn't mean that a cast of women can't carry a movie (which they do) and make it a proper homage to the original, while creating their own identity. I loved it and surely will see it again. I might even buy it.... Just so I can show it to my son and he can create his own opinion and memories about growing up watching a funny movie about busting ghosts. I would wager a bet that if I did that, and showed him the original a few years from now, he'd say this version is actually better.

The plot isn't bad, it could be any ghost buster film. it's just the jokes where terrible and over the top the tone was way too light when someone dies in an extremely brutal way instead of cutting there or showing revulsion they just make a few jokes. The secretary character seemed to be too stupid like it wasn't funny it was cringe-worthy, it made me think that if this person was alive he wouldn't be able to operate from day to day. this made it really hard to suspend disbelief. honestly the final act was crap they gave away the majority in the trailers so there weren't many twists you didn't see coming. the only thing that really redeemed it for me was that it gave me time to play some age of empires 2. just kidding although that was probably the best thing about watching it the plot behind it wasn't too bad",Ghostbusters

1405,wildcatgreg,View from a die-hard Ghostbusters and SNL fan,5,16 July 2016,"Spoilers ahead . . .First off, the movie is not as bad as the trailers. 1/3 of the way into the movie, I was so pleasantly surprised. The introduction and backstory into the initial ghost is scary for a comedic film. The ghost itself is far too neon and detracts from the ominous atmosphere created. All of the ghosts are too neon I suppose in an effort to attract kids, and the effects are worse than the original movie because of it.The humor in the movie is extraordinarily low brow. There are some good moments, but this is so far below the comedic standards set by these four comediennes. This is Michael Bay level humor. I do come away from the movie liking all 4 actresses as the Ghostbusters and believe they can make an amazing Ghostbusters movie if given a decent script.Chris Hemsworth's character is by far the worst in the movie. I am also a fan of his, but they made him far too stupid and unfunny. Think Patrick from Spongebob Squarepants. They made his character so bad that I don't believe they can bring him back for a sequel. How many times can they make the ""he is so hot"" joke? Apparently a lot.The comedy writing was just so inadequate. The Chinese food delivery boy was probably the funniest character in the movie. The movie screeches to a halt when they get to the mayor's office. The ""cat in a bag"" joke has potential to be known as one of the worst jokes in mainstream movie history.The plot started out fine but fizzled once I realized there was not more to it. How are you going to have the pale Hotel worker (he was good in the film) be the main bad guy?! I thought he was going to be the henchman unleashing some cool Babylonian deity or something. And they showed the main ghost in the trailers?! How are going to spoil everything? Truly, in retrospect, the trailers did such a massive disservice to the film.I also did not care for how rapidly they were coming out with new Ghostbusters gear. It took me out of the movie and made me think about how they want to introduce as many potential toys as possible for a cash grab.The incorporation of a female Slimer was also cringe worthy for any fan of the series. How unoriginal can you be? They truly need someone with greater imagination to write the next movie. You are inventing ghosts. You can create anything you want and this is what you do? The cameos from the original cast were fun and well done. Obviously, this movie would have been better as a sequel than an entire reboot.On the whole, it is an average movie. The trailers were done so poorly and revealed too much. I have hope, though, for a new movie with these four women as the Ghostbusters because their characters are great. They just need a new director, new writers, and ghosts that look decent.",Ghostbusters

1408,alord-66973,The kids version of Ghostbusters nobody asked for,4,26 July 2016,"Paying no heed to the gender politics dominating every discussion of this movie, I walked into the theater open-minded with unloaded expectations, prepared to receive a new take on a classic, or so I thought. I was ready to leave the original safely on the shelf, always there whenever I need a fix. I was ready for something new. But what I was not ready for was a children's movie. And that, sadly, is what Ghostbusters 2016 is. For the kids.Though a lifetime fan of the 1984 original, I have laughed at the works of each of the new Ghostbusters, mostly on Saturday Night Live. Jones, Wiig, and McKinnon are hilarious (not a fan of McCarthy, I'll admit). I was ready to embrace this new cast. But as the story unfolds, the jokes consist of seemingly unscripted and unfunny ad-lib banter (if those were written, God help us), and it becomes clear there is no humor in this cast's chemistry. Each scene moves the story along, then offers a few seconds for mechanically forced jokes. The story gets lost in the vast number of terrible quips, many of which consist of fart jokes. That running wanton soup joke gets worse with every iteration.But the worst of it is Chris Hemsworth's Kevin. I figured the moronic receptionist would get a joke or two, then recede to the background. How wrong I was. I laughed when it's revealed Kevin is not wearing lenses in his glasses, then the film rapid-fires dumb-Kevin joke after dumb-Kevin joke. I was done laughing. The problem: Chris Hemsworth is not funny. Not at all. He is the least funny thing about this movie. Worse, as the story progresses, Kevin becomes central to the plot. He is inescapable and ultimately ruins the movie.The lackluster first three-quarters of plot-and-jokes repetition offers little ghostbusting, and what's there is uninteresting. A lot of time is wasted on seeing the new Ghostbuster tools in the design stage (for sake of bad jokes, of course) rather than the team actually using them. But when the finale arrives, the action perks up, and the film becomes tepidly entertaining...in its last 20 minutes. And the villain? I won't discuss him, not because I don't want to spoil the plot, but because there's nothing interesting to say.During one of the movie's fart jokes, I heard a cackle of laughs from the pee-wee audience members. That's when it hit me: Ghostbusters 2016 was made for the kids. And that's fine. The original, though with loads of adult humor, was huge with kids. It'd make sense to calibrate this film to a kid's simple sense of humor. If only they'd have marketed it that way.",Ghostbusters
1409,gretebest,Blatant CASHgrab from SONY,1,25 July 2016,"Let's face facts - they turned GB into a chick flick (can you believe that), guess the idea was that guys would want to see it just because its a GB movie AND girls would want to see it because its about women. The rest of Sony's plan was to make a ton of money from toys and other merchandise. Fair enough plan, but there is a huge problem - the movie is SOOOO BAAAD, it stinks. Its a 1 out of 10 type of film, its just awful...Acting is bad, script is bad, cast is bad, cgi is bad. And the list goes on and on. So lazy of Sony, why on earth didn't they make a well made GB movie in stead of this thrash. I can only think of one reason - trying to make as much money as possible. Shame on you Sony!On a different note - 29.4% voted this garbage of a film a fair rating of 1, yet it has a score of 5.4, considering Sony is probably making some people vote favorably to save face and money, and some activists will give it a high rating no matter how bad it is - the movie rating would have been much lower if it had not been for those people...",Ghostbusters
1410,MrCinemaniac,"I came, I saw, and it doesn't suck!",10,18 July 2016,"I saw the controversial reboot that is Ghostbusters (2016). What are my thoughts? Despite the trailer being the most disliked trailer in YouTube history, upon seeing it in theaters, I don't know about you, but I haven't seen a film that had so much controversy and Internet drama since the first Equestria Girls movie. So, upon seeing it today, while drinking Ecto Cooler, I do think, in my mind that the reboot has pulled off more executions than the old one did.So, before you call foul on this, let me make it personally clear with you before you get the wrong idea: there is absolutely NOTHING wrong with the Ghostbusters being female. I just want to see it without expectations like Pixels, despite having Adam Sandler on it (What else can I say? I'm interested in video games? How can I resist?), and this is what I get from the four main characters. Sorry, so no. I'm not looking forward into hearing anymore of this SJW drama. Okay?Anyway, I give my high score.

And I have to say, I re-watched the original and it just was not as good as I remembered it. I think sentimentality skews your perception quite a bit. My opinion is that this movie really is about as good as the original, it's just that the original gets more of a pass for being... well, original. So with that, I think this reboot had some strikes against it from the get- go. (As well as the aforementioned weird vendetta stuff that somehow made this goofy movie into a supposed feminist conspiracy. Dang, I must admit the entertainment of that was probably the best advertisement any movie could ask for.) That aside, take this movie as what it's meant to be -- it's just a simple, good time. The story is not original. It's not cerebral, ""Royal Tenenbaums"" type stuff. It's not an Oscar Wilde- inspired parody. It's an unpretentious fun summer movie you can see with the family. Yes, there were a few jokes that seemed juvenile (just like the original) and some that missed, but all in all I'd say you will have fun and smile a lot,and the characters are ADORABLE.

It was a good and funny film, and I loved seeing these 4 funny SNL women play leading roles in what is usually male dominated casts in action roles movies. I especially liked Kristen and Melissa, but Jones, and McKinnon were great as well. I thought it was a great mix of pulling from the original, as well as adding new material and great special effects and some pretty scary ghosts in the subway. Don't pay attention to many of the negative reviews, they are probably people who think that any action movie must have males as leading roles.

The movie is also poorly edited in some ways like that scene where the motorcycle explodes and when you can see the one lady (Didn't remember her name because it is that boring) running from the mannequin. In one of the movies first scenes one of the main characters is talking to themselves in an empty college classroom and then starts shaking her butt for no reason what so ever. I also paused at the scene in the dean's office, what the heck was that guy even wearing and what was that decorating. Finally, it was a disgrace to the old crew that Bill Murray's character Dr. Heiss I think the name was, is attacked after one of the girls release a ghost on him, but he was offered the part and took it and it makes him money so good for him I guess.

No. If you absolutely love the original Ghostbusters movie and don't want to see it tampered with, don't see it. If you are willing to see something different and have a couple honest laughs, see it. It's entertaining and funny. In my own opinion, the movie should be looked at as if it has no connection to Ghostbusters. Look at it as a comedic movie and you'll enjoy it. It reminds me of Jurassic World as you have to watch it without thinking to get an amazing experience out of it. Leslie Jones saved this movie for me. The first 30 minutes was unfunny with one of the first jokes being a fart joke. Leslie's character Patty was this outside perspective that I could relate with. Just sitting there being confused. On the other hand, Chris Hemsworth was probably the only person who got almost no laughs out of me. He was just stupid.In conclusion, this movie is an average summer movie.

1423,onmyownanddoingfine-84395,"Finally saw it - not what I expected, but horrible nonetheless",2,28 July 2016,"I was decently optimistic before watching this. My favorite YouTubers who are huge 3rd wave feminist detractors said the movie wasn't half bad and didn't seem to push any kind of agenda as was being claimed so much in the media regarding the movie's detractors' thinking (not that we can believe anything the MSM says anyway).Well, they were definitely right about one thing, there is no agenda being pushed here. Not a single minute or a single line of dialog make me feel like they were trying to push something. With that said, it's a horrible movie.My two big issues with the movie is that it is very boring and I don't consider it to be a comedy.The character progression is practically non-existent: by the end of the film you still don't care about any of the characters (with few exceptions). None of them clicked at all. You learn at the beginning that Mcarthy's character used to be best friends with the woman trying to get tenor: but these two have zero chemistry. The way they act together you get no sense that they are old friends or ""frienemies"", it feels like they just met and the whole script just feels awkward. And forgive me for not remembering a single character's name, that's how much this movie was able to grip me, I don't remember a single one of them (I guess Holdsman was one?)The only one that really had any personality was the intern (Thor) and his character was so over-the-top stupid that it even ruined his good acting. Example: Covering his eyes instead of his ears when loud noises happen. In what world is that considered funny? I know humor is subjective, but I just don't see how that can ever be funny. Nothing about this movie felt like a natural progression of characters.And that pretty much goes for all the humor in this film, it either feels forced into the script and out of place or it just falls flat. The only reason I gave it 2 stars was in the end scene there is about 5 minutes of decent action that pulled me back in to the movie. I thoroughly enjoyed the scene where Holdsman took out the dual pistols and kicked ass. But, once again, it was preluded by what I assume to be something that was supposed to illicit laughs, where she licks the gun, I just found it strange and out of place.The the boss happens, everyone shoots him in the junk, he dies, end of movie. And as far as Patty, she has her stereotypical urban black moments, but that was all the trailers show. In the full movie she doesn't just shout at the camera the whole time and is probably the best fleshed out character out of the four ghostbusters.Conclusion:You never get any kind of connection to the characters due to the bad script (I'm sure the actresses would have done fine together if the script was more organic and naturally progressed the story instead of everything feeling forced).None of the jokes land, either because they are out of place or they just aren't funny (obviously subjective).None of this movie is anti-men or sexist or whatever - the women don't take away anything from the movie: the horrible script does.",Ghostbusters

It's a light hearted movie. About people. Catching ghosts. I think there are far bigger things to get so upset about.I'm also not going to pretend due to the negative feedback on this that it wasn't so refreshing to see un-sexualised, female heroine's up there being hilarious and getting big action sequences and all that.

I am in the prime demographic to feel ""betrayed"" by a reboot, but I adored this movie. Paul Feig and Katie Dippold have written for two of the shows closest to my heart (Freaks & Geeks, Parks & Recreation), so it makes sense that they would ace this seemingly impossible challenge: Make a film that both honors and respects the original, but is also fun and original in its own right. The homages - cameos, quotes, similar scenes - are an absolute joy for their nostalgia AND imaginative reinvention; this is a film that only a die-hard fan could make. Like its source, it expertly blends silly, scary, and the genuine triumph of four friends bringing out the best in each other to save the best city on earth. The leads are terrific, they have their own wonderfully weird humor and rhythm, with only superficial similarities to the characters who came before. This film clearly exists not to replace the original, but to celebrate it and bring something new to the universe. Well-freakin-done, you guys!

What I saw was a two hour mess of a movie. An unfunny, poorly written, poorly edited, contrived cash-in on a beloved classic which has some of the poorest dialogue and worst performances I've seen in a while.

Liked that it was turned into a female hero movie, and also didn't think it was feminist or anything like that. The girls were acting regular.

1433,amkendall-42128,Descent/Non-Misandry Comedy that does not measure up to a Ghostbuster,5,11 June 2017,"BEWARE AGAIN: SOME SPOILERS ARE INCLUDED!!! Ghostbusters (1984) is my all-time favorite movie. I love the sequel, the 2009 video game, Real Ghostbusters series, Extreme Ghostbusters series (which contains a female Ghostbuster), and the comic series (also contains female Ghostbusters). Like all the other fans, I waited patiently for over two decades for a third movie to see the light of day. When I heard the series was going to have a reboot showcasing an all-female team, I was actually quite excited. Especially when I learned it was being directed by Paul Feig, who gave us the buddy cop comedy The Heat, starring Sandra Bullock and Melissa McCarthy, which I deeply enjoyed. But knowing Paul Feig's work, I knew the new film would deal with social issues involving feminism. In my years in the entertainment industry, I have learned one lesson: if you are producing a project that involves heavy themes or social commentary, the story and characters all have to be genuinely good to emphasize the lesson. When they are not, the movie will fall apart completely, and the haters will come out in swarms. And that is what happened when the first production stills, showing bland aesthetics with the Ghostbusters gear, were released. Along with the theatrical trailer - which was one of the worst crafted trailers ever. It looked as though the publicity department hated the film so much, they decided to sabotage it. This caused a huge backlash among worried fans and trolling misogynists. But long after the movie was released and hearing all of the horror stories saying this movie is a man-hating, waste of ectoplasm, I finally sat down to watch it. And my final answer is: not bad. Funny. Definitely not offensive. But it does not measure up to the name Ghostbuster. Most of the reboot's moments come off as what you expect with an SNL script, and not relying on the subtle, deadpan humor which was Ghostbusters' calling card. Secondly, there are zero elements of spooky horror, which is another part of the Ghostbusters saga. The chemistry between the team was there. Unlike the trailer's depiction, Leslie Jones was not the African-American stereotype that everyone was worried about. The main actress who I thought was out of place was Kate McKinnon. Her portrayal of female Egon - Jillian Holtzmann - was so badly telegraphed, she came off as an SNL stock character rather than an honest, Brainiac human being. Chris Hemsworth's secretary character, Kevin Beckman, is an obvious attempt of turning the stereotypical dumb blonde trope on its head. Chris did an amazing job, but his character is so over-the-top and out of place, you can never see this man actually being hired to fill in the shoes for Janine Melnitz. While Ghostbusters' original development team was rooted in SNL and improvisational theatre, the production avoided all attempts to include SNL tropes, and it was that inhibition that gave it so much power. By far, the funniest elements were Bill Murray's cameo and Slimer. Bill plays a TV-celebrity expert who makes his living debunking paranormal claims, and Slimer (near the end) steals the Ecto-1, going on a joy ride with his Slimer-like girlfriend. And those are the main highlights of it. But because of all the movie's shortcomings (including over emphasis on CGI and Scooby Doo effects) along with emphasizing the feminist message, people like me were worried about something deeper. While there were genuine misogynists who tore into this movie, people like me felt trapped. We were left believing that if we came out saying this movie was not that good, we would be branded as misogynists ourselves. Which is why it is so essential to make sure the story is good before dealing with social issues. But in this reboot's defense, it is definitely not full of misandry, unlike what some reviewers claim. One of their main examples is in the final battle when the team shoots the main bad guy (the ghost of a paranormal genius who takes on the form of a large, menacing version of the Ghostbusters logo) in the groin, in order to get the antagonist to let go of the side of the buildings and fall into the ghost portal. They say the groin shot is an attack on men, which is a load of ""ghostly mucus"". For starters, the groin shot trick is nothing new. It has been used to great effect as early as the 1990's. Paul Feig's work has never been focused on hating men, but with empowered women working hard in a world where men are the shot callers. Paul even used the groin shot gag in some of his other movies, yet no one screamed misandry over those incidents. The fact they hold onto the groin shot as an example of misandry is not only troubling, but kind of hypocritical. They get angry when a female Ghostbuster shoots a male ghost in the old Johnson, but laugh when Ray Stantz has a dream of a female ghost unzipping his pants to perform fellatio. So in conclusion: decent acting, fun moments, non-offensive, but finds itself lacking. Worth a viewing, but nothing more. Us Ghostbusters fans will have to keep waiting for an entry that will truly please us.",Ghostbusters
1434,rxholez,I really wanted to like this movie,1,20 July 2016,"I had neutral expectations about Ghostbusters, I didn't know what to expect, but I was hoping it would be a gem. I did not get my wish. Now the special effects were solid, I have no complaints about those I enjoyed them. The plot, although not terrible, did not garner my attention like most good movies do. The acting and the attempts at humor however, were what killed this movie. It was not funny, not at all. The cast, especially Leslie Jones, was atrocious. What could have been a good movie with a better cast was killed by 3 SNL hacks and that woman from that also unfunny TV show. I did not laugh during the entire movie. Not once.

1435,stphbrn-91215,Fun Take on a Classic,9,17 July 2016,"This movie was fun and hilarious!It pays homage to the original while letting it's new, well-defined characters lead the story. Each of the four ladies are written well, and Holtzman easily steals the show with each scene she's in. It's good fun and the humor was on point. The plot structure, at its bones, is like the original movie, but Erin, Abbey, Holtzman, and Patty all make it an entertaining new experience. And it has cameos from the original actors! Look, it's not trying to replace the original movie. It's its own experience. You can have both. I like the original. I really liked this one, too.

If you are a parent go watch this movie with your kids, show them some gender equality and that woman can also be heroes and strong. Critics already love it. What top critics say: The freewheeling and funny solidarity of the four leads win out in the end, even if Feig shows more timidity than he did in Bridesmaids, The Heat or Spy. Crucial to the fun: McKinnon, who steals the movie with her mad-scientist grin, eyes that gleam like a laser pointer and unexpected random weirdness. Jones, McCarthy, McKinnon, and Wiig are so good together - and in ways that are distinctively theirs and not recycled from the past - that their message of not giving a damn resonates better than the movie's underwhelming climax.",Ghostbusters

They also did a great job at paying tribute to the former cast members without ""stealing"" the new cast members thunder and losing focus on the new story. Sure some of the dialogues seemed a bit forced (specially on the comedy side of things) but that's kind of Ghostbusters is all (well mostly) about and the 80's feel they were going for. They played well with gender and racial roles BS subjects. They never tried to hide what some people are calling a ""feminist hidden agenda"" so I don't get why so many complaints..?!

1441,isamail,Not as bad as a lot of people make it out to be - but nothing more than that!,4,9 August 2016,"First of all, I think that a lot of the negative reviews here are very biased against this movie. Sure, it's a reboot that didn't live up to the original but I can't think of a single one that did. My friend dragged me into the cinema to see this film and I tried to be as unprejudiced as possible. I don't normally watch these kinds of movies with comedy actresses like Melissa McCarthy and Kristen Wiig because they're all kind of bland and filled with the same jokes over and over again. Same with this film. If you go in there expecting nothing more than a mediocre comedy then you certainly won't be disappointed, however, if you're expecting something nearly as good as the originals then I suggest that you just re-watch those because you'll probably have a better time! I think that a lot of the 1/10 reviews on here come from all the stuff that people were saying before this movie even came out which caused people to form an opinion before even seeing it. In conclusion, I feel like this is one of those films that you'll watch on an airplane while only paying half attention to it and maybe get a few chuckles out of it. I definitely regret spending money on a cinema ticket to see this though.",Ghostbusters
1442,monkeybazooka,Fantastic re-boot!,8,27 July 2016,"Thoroughly enjoyed this film, it's fast, funny and has some great action. The new Ghostbusters worked so well together on screen and Chris Hemsworth will forever set the benchmark for Himbos! The cameos were fun to spot as well, with all the original cast shining in their brief roles. The writing was tight and some of the gags were so subtle but funnier for it, especially Kate McKinnon. Her lines and delivery were worth the price of admission alone, especially the scenes where they interview Chris Hemsworth's character.A worthy successor to the original Ghostbusters and much better than Ghostbusters 2. Is it better than the first, it's bit like saying is great steak dinner better than a great fish meal, no, they're both great but different.Will definitely be seeing it again and I'm looking forward to all the new cos players that this movie will undoubtedly spawn.",Ghostbusters

I was always disappointed that there were only two women in the original movies, one was the secretary and the other was the victim of the villain. I have always wanted to have more female characters in the lead.I don't know why this got such a bad review. I enjoyed watching it immensely. I thought that it was smart and quirky to have all the main characters played by women. (Yey, girls!) The cast were delightful, and, as expected, their comedic timing was always on point. Their performance was perfect.The plot held up well to all the other previous ghostbusters storylines. It was funny, highly entertaining and witty, and it was something that I'm sure my eight year old self would have loved back in the 80s.",Ghostbusters
1444,jdaugh,"Not garbage, but not good!",3,22 July 2016,"As a fan of the original movies I was mildly excited when I heard that they were going to release a new movie. I didn't really care that it was an all-female cast, although I must say I was curious as to why but it didn't bother me. Then I saw the trailers and my excitement faded as the trailers were complete garbage. They looked like something from a Scooby-Doo movie. So even though I was not as excited to see the movie, I was curious. To be honest, I did have some apprehension but I remained open-minded, and I have to say that my fears were true. This movie was bad. It wasn't the train wreck that I thought it would be, but it was not good. With the exception of the first 15-20 minutes that felt to me like the originals, the rest of the movie was a humorless, irritating mess. The story was nothing special, pretty standard fare for this type of movie and it wasn't that bad, the ending is what killed the story for me. I have read that some people think that it is sexist the way it portrays the men in this movie, well the men in this movie are the only ones that stand out, no that is necessarily a good thing. It was the characters and the cameos are what really brought this movie down. Melissa McCarthy and Kristen Wiig were just there, nothing good, nothing bad just occupying space. They as actresses were fine but the characters that were written for them were very forgettable. Kate McKinnon was a complete mess, she was all over the place and really stood out from the others, but not in a good way, she was too high-strung when compared to everyone else and didn't fit within that group. I heard someone say that it was like she was in a different movie, and I have to agree. Leslie Jones wasn't that bad, she made me laugh a few times, but her character was very one-sided. Chris Hemsworth's character was like a cartoon. He played someone so stupid that I couldn't believe that he was a real person, and the shtick got old really quick. The villain played by Neil Casey was perhaps the biggest disaster of them all. I rooted against him not because he was evil, but because he was a whiny, irritating nuisance. The cameos in this movie brought whatever momentum it was gaining to a screeching halt. I didn't think that one of these cameos was well written or well placed in the movie. I was as if they didn't have the confidence in the movie to stand on its own so they had to force these cameos in. In my opinion this movie seemed like a cash-grab disguised as a legitimate remake. I'm fine with the girl-power idea for the remake, but it wouldn't matter who you had in these parts this movie would still be a failure.",Ghostbusters
1445,mattpionk,Dead On Arrival,3,28 July 2016,"The much anticipated (for better or worse) Ghostbusters refresh hit American soil for mass consumption last evening. Before we venture any further, let's just address the Stay Puft sized elephant(s) in the room: the trailers are bad, the marketing has been an exercise in futility, and I was not looking forward to this film. Much to my surprise, I did not walk out of the theater in a heated rage and my childhood affection for the original film and cast was left completely intact. I did have quite a few light hearted chuckles, but those were negated quickly by cringe worthy and shallow plot devices. This film has been shrouded in controversy and it's not outside the realm of plausibility that the true spirit of the film was left on the cutting room floor with a gentle nudge from studio handlers. In all regards, the finished product delivers juvenile attempts at humor, underwhelming performances, whiplash inducing tone shifts, and special effects you swear you've seen in the last Scooby Doo movie.Read more at www.SlackJawPunks.com",Ghostbusters
1446,rhysparrygeorge,"New Ghostbusters is fun, fresh and full of heart.",8,11 July 2016,"This film is fun! The four leads do some amazing work and there is some true emotion behind all the comedy. The creative minds behind this film obviously love and respect the original and this shines through in some of the more 'fan-servicey' moments. The villain is not incredibly developed but he is still highly interesting, especially when you consider the fact that he begins as a human and becomes a ghost (a twist on the other Ghostbuster baddies, who begin as ghosts and posses people/find human followers). Paul Fieg makes sure that all four women shine together, making their friendship a pivotal part of the narrative. In fact, by the end of the movie, they feel more like a family than a group of co- workers. And seeing them fire up the proton packs for the first time, truly made me feel warm inside. This film is nostalgic yet fresh, funny yet heart felt and a true summer flick. I highly recommend it! Also Chris Hemsworth is amazing!",Ghostbusters

The jokes are razor sharp and quick witted, and they deliver. Kristen Wig is hilarious in this and Leslee Jones brings the house down with a few of her one-liners. Chris Hemsworth shows that he has a great sense of comedic timing, I hope he sheds Thor for more roles like this. The story is somewhat familiar to viewers of the original film. but there are enough new twists to keep your attention rapt. The special effects really help capture the mood in the movie, and some are hair- raising spooky.A wonderful summer movie that brings the fun, the funny, and the entertainment.

The cringe comedy is not my idea of funny, and the delivering of the some lines sound like the actresses don't want to be there.

Its well balanced, has a great story and guaranteed to make you laugh. Would definitely watch it again, this is coming from a teenage couple who regularly enjoy the movies.

Although the movie was able to stand on it's own but one can say that it lacks originality. The plot is poorly written as everything falls into place very conveniently. Abby decides to publish her & Erin's book on ghost 9 years after on the exact time when ghost starts to appear? This makes it very convenient for Erin to meet Abby. But this isn't the main issue; I felt the editing staff made a huge error during the near-ending scene where Erin uses her army knife to pierce through the marshmallow man balloon because their dialogue was awkward after: ""welcome back"" which made me think that they've cut a scene where Erin left the group because she felt they are being displayed poorly by the secret services.",Ghostbusters

I loved the original and my teenage self would've loved this too. Special effects don't make or break a film like this, in my opinion. It's about fun and this flick had lots of it.

The film is disjointed, disconnected and uninteresting. There are precious few funny moments in the film, and even the slightly amusing parts are really quite pathetic. But even more disturbing than the trite script, the random editing and the terrible plot is what the film represents for Hollywood and even the United States of America. This film is without a doubt the final nail in the coffin of the Hollywood production machine. There are no new ideas in the brain bank, just empty rehashings of plot lines that have been done to death. Moreover, the film just emphases how irrelevant the United States has become. The original movie was made in the mid-eighties when the United States was undoubtedly the global power house - economically, militarily and intellectually. Thirty two years later, and the United States is mocked and ridiculed around the globe. The country is basically economically bankrupt, ruled by sad politicians that act more like circus clowns, and the population is tearing itself apart with ethnic tension, police violence and mass shootings.

Kristen Wiig definitely had the best role out of the four Ghostbusters, and usually she's hit or miss for me. I enjoyed most of her time on SNL, but to me she comes no where near Amy Poehler or Tina Fey. Kate McKinnon's character was too over the top for me, and I love McKinnon. I think she is very talented. Never been much of a fan of McCarthy, but she was OK in this movie because she was toned down a bit. Leslie Jones I don't see anything special in her at all. So much of this cast has a past with SNL, and that's exactly what this movie felt like. An over the top big production SNL skit that started well, but ended terribly. The writing to me was the worst part. There was no real creativity, and I feel Feig was trying to capture too much improv which didn't work because it didn't move the story along. This was a challenge that should have been invested with more creativity instead of throwing money at it. I enjoyed parts of this film and would have rated it higher, but the ending ruined it for me. I am a true champion when it comes to women in comedy. I love seeing funny women on screen, but when a movie becomes a political agenda, it takes the fun out of it. You could tell they were focusing on pleasing feminists and trying to bash men, instead of a good story, which is disappointing because I did see potential in this movie. I have an open mind when it comes to comedy, and I try to sit back and enjoy a film as much as possible without being too critical, but I felt the need to express my opinion.

Normally I wouldn't complain about men being the bad guys, but the 'feminists' have been calling men sexist for criticizing their feminist propaganda.Leslie Jones' character was racist too, considering she only had 'street smarts' or whatever.I have no problem with people supporting a supposedly peaceful movement, but please, don't ruin a legendary franchise in your vile attempt of shoving your propaganda down our throats in a totally unfunny and unoriginal manner.",Ghostbusters

The manager signed their tickets and told them to come back to see any movie for free or hang out and watch 'Star Trek Beyond' which was about to start.

The equipment and vehicle were top notch. However, I was mortified by the trailer and appalled at the final product. There were 2 ""feel- good"" team up moments, but the following moment would completely erase the ""feel-good"" with a painful attempt at comedy.

I thought the ghosts, gags, and graphics were very in- keeping with those of the original film, and there were tons of lovely little references... the kind that fans of the original appreciate, and new folks don't particularly notice.The theater I was in laughed almost constantly, there were a couple of nice jump-scares, all the cast had excellent chemistry with each other, and there were some seriously bad-ass fight scenes-- which I definitely was not expecting from a bunch of comedians!I thought the characters were well fleshed-out, with good arcs (even Chris Hemsworth, who i think was supposed to be a throw-away character, got an arc)... and the casting was excellent! I can definitely see why so much of the original Ghostbusters' cast was excited for this addition, and chose to make cameos!If you're on the fence, go see it!

1464,louwigla,This movie made me laugh and scared me at the right moments... I loved it.,7,30 July 2016,"The first ""Ghostbusters"" movies amazed entire audiences, by being both scary and funny at the same time. This movie was able to do just the same. It was also full of references to the previous movies, and surprisingly, I didn't find this tedious at all.I was quite skeptic about it at first, because of all the reviews here on IMDb. Also, it's a remake.I do understand why some people hated it so much: the main characters were all female; practically all men portrayed were quite dumb;  First of all, the main characters in the previous movies were all male, and they certainly didn't need to make all the main characters women, in this recent film, but it was nonetheless fun to see a female ghost-buster. As to the ""dumb"" men, that was uncalled for. This is probably the reason why I won't give this movie a higher rating.I don't believe Chris Hemsworth was the best choice to play Kevin. Every time he appeared on screen there was something off about him. I'm not saying he isn't a great actor, but this role just wasn't right for him. He seemed uncomfortable and his actions looked contrived.The villain's motives/ motivations for the ""destruction of the world"" didn't seem solid enough.Still, apart from these mistakes (there were a few more that I didn't state here), I found myself absorbed by the story, leaving the cinema with a big enthusiastic smile on my face. I certainly don't regret seeing it!",Ghostbusters

If they had made this a cartoon then it wouldn't be out of place, even with a poor script.I was 8 when the original came out and the differences are huge. The original was funny, quirky and dark all at the same time whilst this is just a poor film.Not because it has female leads, its script it quite frankly terrible.There were some good ideas around the weapons in it but all in all I could have sat having a crap on the toilet and had a better time.Glad I only paid a 2.50 to see it!

1466,patte_patrik,A below average movie.,4,2 August 2016,"The Ghostbusters reboot. Oh boy. I heard a whole bunch of bad things about this movie before watching it so i had low expectations, and i was right. It's a below average movie with some cringe-worthy humor that doesn't work most of the time. It does in some parts of the movie though. Although the actors do a fine job i think it's the writers fault for the flop. Since the story and the awful villain are a big part of what makes this movie bad. A few cons among a lot of 'em: The characters. They are very boring and uninteresting characters that make you not care for what happens during the movie and that's not really a good thing. Secondly some parts of the comedy in this movie makes you cringe so hard since they are trying way to hard to be funny in some parts. (This movie has a fart joke) yeah... It's bad, and thirdly is the extremely lame ending. It does however have pretty good effects and visual quality when it comes to ghosts and rays. The movie isn't nowhere near the classic when it comes to fun and characters. Don't waste your money on this.",Ghostbusters
1467,anthonyfrazer-07216,Ghostbusters,10,6 August 2016,"Dr. Yate's hand-held, symmetric photon gun did the trick. Ghosts like driving cars and destroying whatever is in their path. It all begins when a tour guide at an historic house in NYC investigates a noise made behind a locked door where a man's daughter had been kept. Inside the room is a floating, glowing female ghost that was locked up in the room because she had killed her dad's servants. All that expelled green stuff is from dehydration, I guess. That's when the Ghostbusters get a call. The movie's animation is very good and colorful. Some of the Ghostbusters' acting resembles the Three Stooges. Ghosts can get very big. They live anywhere they can, i.e., they can use things as a host like the ghost that was a prisoner hidden in an electrical box along the subway tracks. A Ghostbuster member put a sign of Ghostbuster on the car door. Earlier, a man spray-painted it inside the Seward subway stop. Dr. Gilbert studied the life of a ghost put in a container by the Ghostbusters. One Ghostbuster made a bear trap for ghosts. How inventive. Bill Murray, from SNL, makes a cameo appearance as an authority on hunting ghosts. He's attacked by a ghost while sitting. He's the same very funny Bill Murray. Can the existence of ghosts be explained scientifically? Dr. Gilbert (Kristin Wiig) is funny too and very handy with the Ghostbuster know-how and weaponry.",Ghostbusters

Paul Feig writing and directing credits is for garbage comedy shows and movies. none of them are funny. Katie Dippold isn't safe either and has almost the same writing resume and Feig. it gets rid of ghost busters lore and doesn't take it self seriously. i say you bring Joss Whedon to reboot it again and get rid of this garbage cast. none of them are funny except for Chris Hemsworth and he didn't have a lot to work with.

By this I mean it is inferred that everyone are ""in on the joke"".5. I thought the concept of the ghost busters was catching/busting ghosts?

It's flat out racist! The token black woman is portrayed as a shouty dumb ass with no education and little understanding of the world. She's basically one of those Jerry Springer participants who fight over the same pimp, and tear each others weaves off on stage.8. Sony movies and the director of this movie, have gone to extreme lengths to portray everyone who dislike this movie as sexist, women-hating, basement-dwellers, nerds, geeks, scum. They have been active on twitter, and even made a TV-trailer for the movie to this point. Sony have made this horribly anti-man-sexist-movie, and let's not forget how they portray the black character as a complete IQ-of-60-idiot.

Horrible, simply awful, incredibly uninspired. Hollywood drank Ex-lax and crapped all over the movie screen with this one. I would rather watch a day by day documentary of Hillary Clinton's life then sit through another viewing of this cinematic torture.

Get over yourselves, people. Yes, Hollywood is weird lately, with their new take on Annie, this all-women Ghostbusters, and even Doctor Who becoming Jodie Whittaker.

Kate McKinnon's character was probably the most fun to watch: super sassy and a little flirty and smart. I actually like this better than the original Ghostbusters for a few reasons: less sexist, better effects, and starring women and written with women in mind. Although my husband who saw the film with me enjoyed it too and thought it on par with the old film (that he is a huge fan of)!

I don't know what should else happen to characterize the comedy as a good and successful one. The story was new and very vibrant. What I liked the most about it that I didn't get the sense of it being too long, which happens a lot for some other movies. I think it deserves to be seen and to be continued as a sequel to its own style. I didn't see any men-hating stuff in it and I like the idea women to be empowered with such movies.",Ghostbusters

RESULT: we both loved it. It was very entertaining and of course it is not unpredictable, it is not super clever, it didn't change the way I see life from now on, and of course it had lots to do with the old movies (the old cast was there even) but I really don't understand the bad reviews of it, we had a great time, we laughed a lot, we enjoyed ourselves and I'd recommend it to friends and family. It is a simple movie that will make you laugh, that's it, the main team is build by 4 awkward women and a really handsome equally dumb man with a lot of charisma, the 5 characters are very likable, there are ghosts in it, a simple plot, there you go.",Ghostbusters

The jokes are unfunny over-attempts at humour, a far departure from the original's subtle situational humour (and yes, I will compare it because the creators chose to give it the same name). The characters are nearly all obnoxious and unlikable in almost every way. Jokes continue far past their expiry dates with not only the joke being included but normally a second joke about said joke followed by a commentary and reaction from the cast members.

The second time I watched it with an open mind and really concentrated because I was accused of hating it because the leads are female instead of male, but no it still was horrible. It is just not at all funny. I never laughed once. The frequent nods to the original and the cameos didn't help a bit. It was just so forced. Aside from the actress playing Patty, the other three were just terrible. Their acting was wooden and unbelievable. There was no chemistry between them at all. Patty was the typical black comic relief you found in so many movies in the 80's and 90's. They call it Uncle Tomfoolery in movies, using a black character for comic relief, to act scared, to trot out superstitions and ghost stories, and add the occasional religious humor. She was at least a decent actress. As much as I like to look at Hemsworth, he added nothing to the movie. Janine actually served to further the plot and had some funny moments herself. Kevin was a weight, dragging down an already lame production. The ghosts looked ridiculous, less interesting than the ones in the original even though we have much better CGI these days.

I usually take a look at ""Rotten Tomatoes"" and their tomatometer is usually fair. The rating for this movie was 73% and their top critics gave it a 59%. This movie is way bellow average which makes me question the critics' ethic system. A serious critic would never rate this movie highly.I am all for the female cast selected. Kristen Wiig and Melissa McCartthy, who were great in Bridesmaids, were awful here. They must have done it for the money, otherwise I cannot understand what they had it mind. The dialogues were stupendous and the humour was so basic (if not childish) it got irritating. The movie tried to pull of ""feminist"" jokes, only to undermine feminism completely. I won't comment on the sexist and racist stereotypes, but not because they weren't there. Rather because I wouldn't know from where to start. People focus on the dumb blonde secretary (who is male in this case) but that is the most innocent form of stereotyping. The two leads are scientists and they pretty dumb themselves. Then there is the street smart black member, the chubby girl moaning about her food all the time (yet keeps ordering from the same restaurant). Obviously this movie is targeted to a crowd with low standards, but it's just sad to see this happening for this particular movie. We live in the 21st century and this is the best entertainment Hollywood has to offer? What were they thinking?They even brought in the old cast, just to have them in the credits I suppose. In truth they had nothing to offer in the movie whatsover... Bill Murray's cameo was pointless and they killed him in a heartbeat. No respect for the original movies at all.I strongly advise everyone to avoid this flop of a movie, especially fans of the originals.

Come on they even copied ideas from the previous two. I hope that someone will re make another one to keep the good name of the Ghostbusters.

It had a very weak ending. Spoiler Alert: Dumb blonde secretary role is OK but make it more believable more clumsy vs lazy/ I didn't feel like it. I love the Uniqueness of the jokes in the movie. so many comedies that are made are not unique in their jokes. I feel keeping the humor clean will give the movie added uniqueness.

After all the negative comments and trashing this movie had received I was rather surprised to find myself and my family all laughing to this movie. It was very funny. It is either going to be a you like it or don't. I would tell anyone to watch it first instead of reading all these reviews of people who seem to think they are some sort of critic and judge it for yourself. I think the problem is with these sort of movies is people struggle with change. Any change is bad. Doing a remake is horrible and distasteful and heaven forbid if you change the gender of the cast because it will get bashed all over. People need to get the sticks out of there butts.

No...this is not Ghostbusters 3...probably why they didn't give it that title. This is its own movie. Very funny and awesome. The ghosts were visually intriguing. The humor was on point.

Watching this film I know what is wrong with America and why we voted for Trump. This film is unoriginal, unnecessary and preys on what the Hollywood system thinks we want to see. Basically, it feeds back to the viewer what the system sees as what we will buy. Ghostbusters 2016 is a rip off, copycat remake but first is not as funny, two is unoriginal and shows America is out of ideas and third tells America is it valid with a large woman, a black woman, a farting woman, a homosexual woman and so forth. This is exactly what Trump did. He told middle America what they want to hear like a good con man would and won. So Ghostbusters 2016 knows America is in decline and a impolite place with a lack of class and shows it to us. Yes, indeed it is a waste of film with completely unfunny (so-called) jokes, but hey why come up with anything half new? Just feed people some drivel which this is.

1488,bs-33761,It's neither good nor bad,5,22 December 2016,"Being a fan of the original Ghostbusters and really hating the idea of rebooting/reworking old classics, i was against this movie from the very beginning.I never quite understood why they wanted an all female cast, but i didn't mind either. Ghostbusters is about people hunting ghosts. Although if you want to diversify, go the Ghostbusters Extreme Route where you had a man in a wheelchair, a black guy, a Latino guy and an Asian Girl (who was kick ass).Nevertheless. The first Trailer rubbed me really really wrong. The jokes looked Adam Sandler bad and sonyleaks didn't really help to erase my fears, that this movie would be really really REALLY bad.I tried to watch the movie as unbiased as i could and give it a real Chance.It started of strong, with some good and funny jokes. Then the protagonists show up after the worst Version of the Ghostbusters-Theme i've ever heard.The Moment the protagonists showed up, the movie started to crumble. Abby Yates was unlikable from beginning to end, Erin Gilbert was just painful to watch (you can go too far with trying to make a character likable by being clumsy and awkward), Jillian Holtzmann was... i don't know what she was but she got some chuckles out of me.The most likable and relatable character was Patty Tolan, who was not nearly as bad as the Trailers made her out to be. She had some legitimately funny Scenes.But the Comedy is the main Problem of this movie. Some jokes are actually funny... but then the movie has to rub it in your face, that this was in fact funny... and why it was funny...and then they repeat the joke...The movie got the same Problem with the direction. Every time you think the movie is getting momentum they shove in an unfunny joke, an unneeded cameo or something else that rips you out of the movie and reminds you, that this is just a Ghostbuster retelling.The male characters didn't help either. Rowan might become the most forgettable villain ever and Kevin was portrayed so dumb.. even Rob Schneider wouldn't wanna play him.But besides all this heavy critique... the movie isn't BAD but it's also not good either. It's entertaining. Every time the movie tries to be original (Action Scene in the end) it legitimately got a spark. But it's weighted down so heavily by trying to be the original Ghostbusters while trying to be something completely different while also trying to be a ""bridesmaids with ghosts"" at the same time.The movie is a mess with a lot of potential. So if you have to do a reboot of Ghostbusters... Reboot GB16 without Paul Feig and make it a really original Story. You can even use the same actors.

This isn't a film for girls or a film for boys, those who are uncomfortable with this really need to go and take a gender studies class - the world doesn't revolve around your fragile male egos, you simply need to educate yourself and move on.

And seriously, that is a lot to read. And the first thing I read about this film was the serious amount of crap being said about it. Which, you know, made me sad, not just for the tone of the *cough* reviews *cough* but also because I knew this movie is starred by some of the best comedians out there nowadays. And yes. Turns out they are women. Deal with it, trolls.This said, reboots are not my cup of tea. I'm tired of the lack of risk that Hollywood has shown for the last two decades. But you know, my father doesn't like technology either. He thinks he was doing OK without it before its tsunami happened,which doesn't mean it DID happen.So I entered the theater with this in mind. I tried to see Ghostbusters as if it was my first time, not giving the chance to the downers, nor even my melancholia, to spoil it for me. And it really worked. Despite a script, or should I say the edition of it, who appears to try to move forward at the speed of light it didn't disappoint me. McArthy, Wiig and McKinnon (whom is my favorite American comedian at the time) are great on their characters and you can find my beloved Leslie Jones in a role a bit less histrionic than usual. Fun cameos I won't spoil and many Easter eggs for us, the ones who actually did see the original film. Good entertainment, special effects top notch, a little overdone though, as any AAA film nowadays. I definitely recommend this films for +8 kids, families and nerds like me, for instance.

My sister-in-law is fat etc It is just that Melissa Maccarthy is no good and she goes out of her way to be gross. It's like 'I am gross and so I am going to play it up as if it is an act' No, it is because you are gross, sugar plum. Anyway her time has already come and gone and her no-talent act is dated. Forgetting her the film is not funny. I mean who else is not tired of the endless gags, commercials, strong females beating up men and making them look like losers in series on TV? This is just another film along those lines. Why pay to watch this humorless rip off reboot sequel? Just watch a stupid TV commercial where the dumb man is proved stupid by the bright woman. Women's liberation is not achieved by making men dumb... and if you think that then you are dumb. As for Hollywood: get an original idea.

Thank God.I do understand the negative reviews. White men holding on to the lost era of male-actor-dominated 80s comedies where women were at best objects of deep affection. No more. All of the ""comedies of today"" above have something in common: Women are the Protagonists.Contemporary scriptwriters and directors like Katie Dippold & Paul Feig - in Ghostbusters 2016 - create and capture the remarkable freshness of Leslie Jones, Kate McKinnon, Melissa McCarthy and Kristen Wiig to celebrate a new comedic era where women's perspectives have become much more interesting to explore than men's. And most men like it too. Until they become nostalgic of the 80s. Don't touch ""their"" 80s comedies.Let's celebrate the comedy times we live in just like Ghostbusters 2016 does. Thank you for this new era of comedy! Thank you Leslie Jones, Kate McKinnon, Melissa McCarthy, Kristen Wiig, and the many other top comedian-actresses in film and TV: Amy Schumer, Ellen, Rebel Wilson, Maya Rudolph, etc. etc.In TV and movies, women are - at last - TRULY ALIVE!",Ghostbusters

The ghosts felt extremely weak and underdeveloped/not inspired.It gets one star for having the name Ghostbusters and one star for the original cast's cameo and that is about it.Remakes and reboots are generally sad and this was even sadder. It just plain disappointed this girl. The supreme big ghost was a complete unimaginative joke compared to an actual spirit that is evil.

And the former is one of my all time favourites.I'm just glad I didn't watch it at the cinema, and therefore didn't have to pay anything to see it.This film runs like a series of sketches, which are then force fed to the viewer, rather than simply being funny in-of-themselves as part of the actual story. Whilst the cast are very funny people in other things, in this - the chemistry of main group is rushed, half- baked, and therefore unbelievable. Compare that to the dynamic of the cast in the original, and it's like comparing a picture your kid did with some great work of art. It's not even worth going into detail over, because the faults in this movie by comparison are so many and obvious, as to make all comparisons pointless and any real in depth cinematic critique an excercise in futility.If you feel you want to see it, I would say do so by all means - but borrow it or watch it for free, do not pay for it.

And the first time I watched it, I strongly disliked it for the same reasons I disliked the first ones, cheesy cgi, cheesy jokes, just a big cheese fest. However, I'm a fan of Kate McKinnon, so I decided to give the movie a second chance, and really paid attention to the characters and the story. And I liked it, a lot. I have since seen it 5 times. Which is why I'm making this my first review on IMDb. This movie got a lot of mixed reviews, and I think anyone scrolling through and reading them, should know it might just need another chance.

These ghost busters just want to be believed and taken seriously as scientists....and save the world too. Refreshing that in a chick movie, they weren't all competing for a guy, or having makeovers, those seem to be the standard tropes in chick movies these days. Went home and watched the original afterwards, was surprised by the sexism of most of the humor, i had forgotten that part of it.

A lot of jokes do fall flat, but there are decent ones mixed in that makes this made this movie somewhat watchable. Although one thing that weakened the comedy a bit was the way they made the girls the best in the world in their fields. It clashed with the self depreciating humor. The story it self made little sense, and I had a hard time following it, or understanding the motivations of the characters. This didn't hurt the movie in the beginning.

Especially Kate McKinnon's eccentric performance. I know I'm alone on this but the ensemble was better even if the reboot didn't break new ground.

On the good side: a great cast, a good script, and a lot of fun material. The interplay of the whole ensemble was good, and there were a lot of great gadgets and jokes. There were some missed opportunities. I loved Melissa McCarthy in The Heat and Spy, but here she isn't quite as awesome. It feels like the writers expected her to be awesome just by her presence, instead of writing a cool character for her to play. Still, she was solid, and the rest of the cast shined.It did get a little CGI heavy at points for my tastes, but that's true for just about every big movie these days.

This movie was fun and why IMDb has it at such a low rating clearly shows how many misogynist are out there mad because this was a female cast.

The humor and chemistry between actresses works wonderfully. The supporting cast is just as good, most notably Thor's turn as the clueless secretary.The cameos and call-backs to the older movies, while ever-present, were much more natural feeling than previous reboots. Only one cameo felt out of place, and it was the one you would least suspect.While I actually don't love it enough to give it a 10 (probably 8.5 is where I would land).

But it was aimed at kids and they seem to like it.NOW HEMSWORTH. AAAARRRRGGGGHHH!!! Even my nephew hated him in this.

The stereotypical abrasive black woman who 'don't need no man' and the other bland characters made this movie an insult to the 1984 movie we all love so much.

The only place I seem to find criticism is online, mostly because men are whining about how ""the feminists are taking over!"" Which I am so very sorry to say, is not the case. What this movie does it simply: It preserves the comedy, action, intrigue, and joy of the original Ghost Busters, but without all the blatant sexism! It has incredible stars, hilarious dialogue, and a plot that is just as engaging as anyone can expect from a Ghost Busters movie. Aside from people complaining that there isn't enough misogyny for this to be considered a winner, the only other complaint I see is that it's predictable: you know who the villain is, you know who the good guys are, and you know that there will be a happy ending. But if you don't like that, your problem isn't with the 2016 reboot, it's with Ghost Busters in general. This isn't supposed to be a serious, gripping drama; it's a science fiction comedy with lovable characters and fun adventures. My only complaint is that there's too much throw back to the previous films. I understand some people wanted to see old characters and all, but they really weren't necessary, and just ended up muddling the plot. Overall, though, I highly recommend this movie to anyone who isn't a whiny piss baby who feels threatened anytime they see a woman in power.",Ghostbusters

Not worked in the sense this movie would be considered a masterpiece like the original. But worked in the sense that this movie could have provided something decent for us. Without a well crafted script with carefully executed comedy, this movie relies heavily on improv comedy. This movie falls short not because of the cast, as it is usually never the casts fault for the downfall of a movie, it's the writers and director. I actually love Kristen Wig and occasionally Melissa McCarthy. They're quite funny actors. The problem is that Ghostbusters is supposed to be a movie that gives the punchline and let us take in the cleverly subtle jokes, it's like a good meal. The meal being the plot. The desert being the comedy. But the writers and director of this movie believe if they stuff our mouths with constant dialogue, improvised dialogue may I add, every second of the movie, we'll start enjoying it. There are moments in the movie that I almost laughed, before it was shut down by actors constant need to throw in more dialogue. Movies like this don't need improv. Movies like Bridesmaid are great for that, because with a casual setting and tone, improvised lines make the movie more impressive. However, a movie rebooting one of the funniest comedies ever made, that has to do with ghosts and science fiction. Is not a movie in need of improv.",Ghostbusters

True fans understand this stuff: They have the intellectual capacity to appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they're not just funny-they say something deep about LIFE!The haters really are idiots-of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in such an existential catchphrase ""That one came from the front"" which itself is a cryptic, intricately coded reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons.

There's some slight retreading of original story elements especially in the beginning. But, that's my only real complaint.It's well paced, gives you some ghostly encounters while moving through forming up the team and keeps consistent laughs though the whole length.The effects are well rendered and visually interesting with colors and creepy designs.

1539,slimkrispy,"I had heard the trailer looked bad, but I liked the movie",8,20 July 2016,"I don't usually write reviews but so many people were dogging this movie, and I just saw it and thought it was pretty good. I also usually don't like remakes either, especially if it's one of my favorite movies but I felt like they actually made a whole new story, just keeping small reminders of the best parts from the originals. The original actors had small cameo appearances, and just one or two of the classic lines were quoted. Normally remakes and even sequels just rip off of the first movies and try to stretch a story that isn't there. This was like meeting a whole new cool group that reminded you of some old friends.I agree that on a lot of movies lately, they take awesome actors and give them some basic crap dialogue, and this could have been a little better in that department, but it wasn't awful either. I definitely laughed out loud plenty of times and there were some great scary moments like the originals. To the people saying this movie is sexist, it's the all female ghost busters, that's the point so of course they're taking liberties with some of the male characters. I'm pretty sure it was on purpose and more tongue in cheek than truly offensive. No one complains about all the other movies with stupid half naked female characters, so in the nicest way possible, bite me.I wasn't a fan of some of the typical ""action movie"" background music . They need to hire some new composers. Lord of the rings and gladiator music doesn't have the right vibe for ghost busters. If you disagree, that's your opinion, this is not to put anything up for debate, just to give another view to people who may also want to see the movie.",Ghostbusters

First thing: this movie is sexist. Every single male (except the last cameo) is either inept at his job, a coward or completely retarded. How to kill the villain ? hit him in balls. The ""funny"" in the movie: well, a fart joke. That's it. The rest is embarrassing to watch, the chemistry between the actors is nonexistent, thus the lines seems monotonous and comes out forced. I felt sorry for the actors they had to do this. It's like a direct to video that went on the big screen just because of the franchise. Sharknado became good because it was so bad. This ghostbusters can't even claim that. It's just bad and can never be good.Do yourself a favor and just buy the two original movies.

1543,rangermcdowell,Actually enjoyable,8,31 October 2021,So when I seen this advertised I have to admit I thought here we go a classic hashed out with an all female cast.... I admittedly avoided this film because of that. I then sat down to watch it this Halloween and I really enjoyed it. Lots of new gadgets and gizmos being tried and tested I think the cast are great and make a good on screen team and the cameos are a nice touch. Ghost busters is a family friendly classic with light humour and that's exactly what it delivers. A sequel if it ever happens would definitely be a family trip out to the cinema!,Ghostbusters
1544,deannwo2000,been there done that and it was better the first time around,6,27 November 2016,"Mild and I do mean very Mild Spoilers. First of all I love Ghostbusters the original and Ghostbusters 2 secondly I think Melisa McCarthy is fantastic in every movie I've seen her in especially The Heat but sorry to say this movie just wasn't as good as the original though not as bad as the damn trailers made out god those trailers sucked, I'll start with the good Kevin played by Chris(Thor) Hemmsworth was funny as hell so was Holtzman though the problem with Holtzman was she was pretty much a combination of the Peter, Ego and Ray which gives her a whole lot of personality shame the same cant be said about every one else in this movie. The FX looked better than the originals but we are like 30 years on. OK so the bad Chemistry simple as the writer forgot that this needs to be key there is imply none I've seem the leads in this movie blow it out of the park before all I can figure is they realised they had signed on to a movie that just wasn't that good as the chemistry wasn't there. Replacing smart science an character based comedy with pure slap stick. Yes there is slap stick in Ghostbusters but its smart funny and the dialogue is still some of the most quotable in movie history. And any one that tells me that people prefer slap stick I will point to the big Bang Theory being one of the most popular and longest running sitcoms around. The Plot borrows heavily from the first film and rubs your nose further in it by having the original cast show up in some cameos. Which then reminds you of a superior movie. I'm not saying this movies Awful what I'm Saying is its a missed opportunity due to a poor script and lack of on screen chemistry. I think the major problem here is the Executives not understanding the Brand particularly well. with out the original to compare it to I'd say it was fun but forgettable.",Ghostbusters
1545,copper_42,Not as bad as it's made out to be,8,19 July 2016,"Pretty good reboot. I enjoyed it and even got some scares in along with  the laughs. I think the problem with reboots is, a lot of people have  high expectations. I recently re-watched the original Ghost Busters  prior to watching the new one.   For those saying the movie was slow to begin with. It's a reboot. A lot  of young people may not be interested in the original (because of its  age) and cannot relate to it, so though WE a generation who know the  original might think the story goes slow. The NEW generation are  getting educated and schooled in the world that is Ghostbusters.   Could it have been better? Yes. Almost all movies could have been  better when you critically analyze them to their molecular level. I  enjoyed the build up and tried to see the films retelling with fresh  eyes. I think it did the job.   It had enough nods to the oldie while continuing on its OWN path. I  enjoyed the scene after the credits and I do hope there will be a  sequel. One that will dive more into the story next time now that the  generation have had their reboot retelling of critical background  information.

If the original source material does not stand up to the test of time, remake it if you have to...but Ghostbusters 1984 still hits the mark.GB16 admittedly was not as bad as the trailers implied, I fully expected to give it 1 star, but it is bad.The good points: - the music: the good news is that that terrible Fall Out Boy/Missy Elliott concoction makes only a brief appearance, I was pleasantly surprised by the use of the original song - the cameos: we all wanted to see the original cast return in their previous roles of course, but the cameos were done well I thought (except for Bill Murray's, his seemed very strained) watch out for the bust of Harold Ramis, a nice gesture but I think the homage to Harold in the Lego Firestation HQ is far more poignant - the Firestation HQ cameo: it was great seeing it on the big screen again although I never want to see the pole used in the manner suggested by McCarthy! - the supporting cast: Hemsworth and Garcia in particular were quite solid Hemsworth had some good lines and the times I did utter a laugh were down to the supporting castSo basically most things I thought were good about the film had to do with the original and appealed to my sense of nostalgiaThe bad points: - bad script: 95% of the jokes were not funny, the story line was poor, the main bad guy was lame with no real explanation as to why he did what he was doing or how he knew how to create inter- dimensional portals - the main cast: why the original movie stands up to the test of time is mainly due to the characters who feel real. The main cast in this were caricatures, overt stereotypes with no real likable qualities - the weapon testing scenes: slapstick comedy at its worst! - the constant referrals to their sex and race - unnecessary, we can see you're women so we don't need reminding by referrals to your breasts and 'cracks' - the toilet humour: I'm childish enough to laugh at a fart still but when you rely on this type of humour in a summer blockbuster and in a reboot of a movie so revered as GB84 you're doing yourself no favours: to then take it a step further and make a fan*y fart joke, the tone of the movie is just shot to pieces - the CGI: the ghosts looked as bad as they did in the trailer...the original 1984 effects were way betterThe tone of the movie felt similar to The Watch (but not as good, and that wasn't brilliant, although I liked it!) It's a film most will watch out of curiosity like I did, it exists now and that can't be changed it could have been a bit worse but it could have been a whole lot better in the right hands",Ghostbusters
1548,yasia-84467,"Enjoyed it, funny characters and good vibes",7,31 August 2021,"Had a few laughs, enjoyed the movie. Each character had a distinctive type of comedy, which reimagined the movie instead of it just being a copy. The actors had great chemistry together. Apart from just being a ghostbusters comedy, it flips the switch in an amusing way. Not for the fragile ego.Too bad a troll army mobilised itself to deliberately plunge and skew the ratings and bump up their own hateful comments, instead of just giving their honest opinion, once and in their own name, after actually seeing the movie. Pathetic attenion-seeking behaviour.Many of them are honest about their motivation to do this: they are upset that the main characters are women. One suggested we should go apologise to our fathers. I am not making this up. For the few that actually saw it, they find it upsetting that some jokes are deconstructing gender stereotypes (which were very present in the original), intelligently and smoothly making the stereotype the joke instead of the group it is generally about. Examples are the male sexualised bimbo secretary (being portrayed as dumb and hot as the full character description can make some uncomfortable, which is nothing new but you aren't ready to have that conversation), ""girls can't shoot"" and other things girls can't do, like be the main character in a ghostbusters movie. Others still pretend they are just upset that there is a remake, no really, they swear, why won't you believe them. Yet such backlash (even before the movie came out) was absent from other remakes, like planet of the Apes and evil dead.",Ghostbusters

Absolutely loved it and still brings back great memories but I don't understand why lots hate this movie to the point of poisonous hate mail sent to the cast. I think this movie was entertaining and funny. A different perspective but still had the same offbeat humour. No it wasn't the same awesome experience I remember as a kid but as a stand alone movie highly entertaining. It seems odd that America can handle something's but not females in great roles. Seems every new female remake on movies is hated with venom maybe because you don't want a female President. Who knows? For those of us outside the States it doesn't make sense.

I'm so sorry that their fragile dispositions can't fathom the idea of a female-led Ghostbusters remake and that they'd rather devote their time to tearing this movie down than to, I don't know, contributing anything positive to the world. My family and I are fans of the original, but that did not stop us from greatly enjoying Feig's remake. It was definitely one of the better films I've seen over the summer. I feel like there's been a dearth of great summer movies since the earlier releases (Captain America, The Nice Guys, etc.), so this was a pleasant change. Wiig, McCarthy, Jones, and McKinnon all had hilarious moments in the movie and continue to show that they are some of the funniest actors around. Chris Hemsworth has never been funnier and was a scene stealer with his character's idiocy. I know some critics have said that the plot was thin or that the jokes didn't land. I'll concede to the plot being pretty light, but there were literally only a couple of times where the jokes didn't get a laugh from the audience. Some of the lines were a little cheesy, but there's nothing in this movie that warrants it having a 4.4 rating on this website. If you're looking for a thoroughly enjoyable summer movie, Ghostbusters fits the bill.

It's Ghostbusters for the kids of today! And that's an awesome thing! This movie is fun and funny, sure it may not be everyone's taste in humour, but not every movie is! So I don't understand all the hate it's getting.
It's okay to like a remake and still love the original! I know I do, the new take on ghostbusters was refreshing and quirky and I loved the exploration of friendships. (With cool science!)

Firstly, it just isn't funny. The laughs are forced and many of the scenes are straight rips-offs of the original films without any new clever twists.The 'Girl Power' angle is a cringe-inducing throwback.Ghostbusters is pushing the idea female heroes are some kind of novelty but we've had major film franchises starring women (Alien, The Terminator) since the Eighties, and critical and commercial hits like Zero Dark Thirty, Gravity and Mad Max: Fury Road. Most horror films feature women as the main protagonists, and have done so for decades.None of those were marketed as 'women's films' or attempted to shame audiences into watching them; they were advertised as thrilling, or funny, or scary, and judged according to whether they were successful on those terms.There have been women doctors, lawyers, and politicians in the West for more than a hundred years now, but hammering away at the old, Victorian inequalities as if they were still current will still get a rise out of a certain kind of flat-headed bint. Obviously not enough of them to save this film, though.

Seeing over the top characters goofing around and making strange faces, while all talking at the same time for 2 hours is simply too much.
The only real movie actor is Hemsworth, who got a totally useless role. Seems like men around female heroes have to be excessively mean or dumb or weak or a combination of all of this. Why? It doesn't make the main characters more likeable or look smarter.

But as the film went on, I got into it more and could see it for what it was - a fun, entertaining film.I think the casting was spot on. Kristen Wiig's awkwardness was done well, as was Melissa McCarthy's brashness. But for me, the stars of the movie were McKinnon and Hemsworth. They brought a real humour to the movie, and both in very different ways. Chris played the un- intelligent male secretary very well, and showed me a side of him I'd not seen before. McKinnon, I had not seen at all, and I thought she was brilliant. Her mannerisms, jokes and timing were spot on, and had me laughing on multiple occasions (let's not forget she's cute as hell, too). I also enjoyed Leslie Jones' character, again, adding good humour, I could tell from the scene in her subway booth she was going to be good.Is this movie perfect? No, not at all. The cameos were forced (Ozzy), and there was some dialogue and scenes which weren't great (I didn't really like the shooting in the crotch or buddy saving scenes), but I still think this film is solid, and entertaining. What more do you want from this film? The CGI was good, especially the big battle in times square. If you want to enjoy this movie, DO NOT go into the film even thinking about the original Ghostbusters movies. There is just no point. It is not the originals, and it is not trying to be, either.Go into this movie with the intentions of wanting to see a a fun and entertaining movie, and take it for what it is, and I have no doubt you will enjoy it.",Ghostbusters

I felt that the animation used on the ghosts was perfect, it was stylized to look realistic yet cartoonish, fitting well with the humour and overall feel of the film. There were more little nods towards the original movie than I thought there were going to be, this was greatly loved, they ranged throughout the whole film and were not just lumped together. All the characters were played wonderfully by the actors, particularly Kate McKinnon and Neil Casey, they gave their all and it really worked for their strange characters. The pacing of the movie was very good, it certainly didn't feel like I sat there for two hours, boredom never once took hold. I appreciated the struggle the main characters went through to assert themselves where as in the original movie the Ghostbusters where accepted quickly and without much hassle. The remake made good use of artistic interpretation, sticking to a similar plot as the original but not copying it word for word or scene by scene.

I've seen ye olde Ghostbusters, and for the time when it was made it was great, but this new rendition of the Ghostbusters blew it out of the water. it has a great plot, somewhat better than that of the old Ghostbusters with a story that felt very grounded in society as it is now. It has great characters, who were impressively written, and had me laughing out loud the entire movie. Kate McKinnon was a particular stand out. Her portrayal as the experimental physicist / tech genius Jillian Holtzmann who was quirky, intelligent and badass all at the same time was brilliant and had me loving every scene she was in. The humour in the movie is very akin to that of the original Ghostbusters, though modernised, and with the cast including members from Saturday Night Live the hilarity was to be expected, just somehow it exceeded my expectations.Out of the many movies I've watched this year, which include a list of all the superhero movies that have come out so far, and a few movies like 'Now You See Me 2' and others like 'How To be single', this was more enjoyable, I plan on re-watching it next week.",Ghostbusters

1569,jorian-2,"Watchable, but really bad",2,12 July 2016,"Ignoring the vitriolic media coverage and backslash to fans isn't easy in the case of this movie. Those who like the movie are getting called 'paid' for their opinion, and those who dislike it are called 'misogynist' and 'sexist'. It got so bad that one can't seriously write about the movie itself without touching on this issue. I just wish those criticizing the negative comments would realize that many women also hate the movie, just check youtube pre/reviews as proof.Now about the movie:It's a wreckage of bad gags, I don't know if it's the fault of the actors or the script. I assume mainly the script and director.There are better MOMENTS in the movie, but the whole movie is overshadowed by 'product placement' adverts The movie is full of references to other movies, most better jokes are also revolving around them.Just as in case of politicians I don't care what their gender is, as long they do their job right, which isn't the case here. If you've seen the trailers you pretty much already saw it all. The only black female character in the team of 4 is a walking bag of stereotyped black women, a racist insult in 2016. The characters are forgettable, the main villain is forgettable, the cameo appearance of the original cast is forgettable and feels out of place. People walking out on the movie when the theater is just half full also means something. Just to clarify: It doesn't mean people leaving are sexist (especially girls), it means the movie is BAD. The movie is a forced caricature and parody of the original movie, there is no need to see this instead of just watching the original movie. All the male characters are caricatures and targets of jokes, it's like a female mirror version of movie sexism. Annie Potts as Janine Melnitz was not an idiot, why did the male version become one? He is still the best character. There is no character development, only stereotypes and bad jokes, did I mention the racist depiction of the only black woman yet?Pixels was far better at grabbing interest with its nostalgia for old things than this ...thing that is definitely just a cash grab. (especially considering the product advertising everywhere) The actors are not that bad, but the script just makes it all terrible, and drags them down as well.tl;dr - This reboot is a terrible parody and caricature of the original movie with bad jokes(?) and an insult to black women. Actually, an insult to everyone who liked the original movies, or the animated cartoon series, or the Extreme Ghostbusters series (which would've been a far better choice for a real, more inclusive sequel movie). There are scenes in the movie which make it feel the whole fan-insulting campaign in the media over the last few months was actually a planned part of the marketing as the movie mocks the fans and original movies more often than not. It will have fans among first watchers of the franchise, many will support it simply for being 'different', and while it's true that many original fans never support a remake or reboot, this won't become a masterpiece even without them just because of genderswap and bad gags. It won't reach the same good review scores as the original.I don't suggest to stay clear of it, but I do suggest to show only the original movies to your children instead of this mess.",Ghostbusters

1573,bananaoctopus,"Ignore the hate, it's a great film",8,24 September 2016,"Despite all the nonsense hate Ghostbusters has received it's actually a funny and entertaining film that honours its predecessor while maintaining it's own direction. I grew up in the 80s, I loved Ghostbusters (and to a lesser extent Ghostbusters 2). I watched The Real Ghostbusters cartoon and owned Ghostbusters books and clothing. I think Ghostbusters 2016 is a great addition to the Ghostbusters universe.I think if it hadn't received so much hate prior and during release its IMDb rating would be sitting between a 7 and 8 (complete conjecture, yes).Watch it!",Ghostbusters
1574,pentido,Utterly sexist.,1,12 August 2016,"Visually impressive, with an amusing plot. However, its explicit misandrist view (all men are stupid, gay and/or... stupid again) makes it unwatchable. For a movie which strives for gender equality, this movie does a lot worse than the original, it is stereotypical, at times disgusting (fart jokes en masse) and at its core utterly sexist. The movies has its high points, esp. visually and a great cast. But the dialogue reveals the sexist attitudes of Sony, of the writers and that does not bode well for a movie which is aimed for the masses. Mind you, half of it is male. This is a movie about sexism and not Ghostbusters. This could have been a great installment (why reboot anyway?) with many nods towards original, but in the end it was just a kick in the groin against all men (oh yes, and it is homophobic too).",Ghostbusters

The jokes are what THEY find funny.There is nothing wholesome here for your children to watch, unfortunately, and that is mainly why this movie fails so badly.It's strewn with out of place sexual innuendo, a lot of rudeness, and a cast who all try to be funny, instead of trying to put down a character.

1585,wojohitz,I really haven't loved a movie this much in a long time.,10,12 August 2016,"Before all else, this movie is funny and it is fun. From the very first lines, every theater I've been in has been laughing along with it from the beginning. I've seen the film with seven different groups of people now (yes, obviously, I liked it a lot and wanted to support it) and every single group has laughed a lot and had a good time. Seriously, isn't that the entire point of an action comedy? The film is visually appealing and creatively engaging and every time I see it, I see something new, and every time, it still makes me laugh. Are there some stupid lines? Yes. Are there some logic gaps? Yes. Are there a couple of times where I'm like, ""Wow, who really decided to include that?"" Yes. But is there some hilarious and awesome stuff happening? Absolutely.Full disclosure: I'm a feminine 35-year-old lesbian, and Kate McKinnon's brilliant performance as Jillian Holtzmann has no doubt contributed to my endless enjoyment of this movie, but there is so much more to love in addition to that. This is a movie featuring four smart, funny female characters who are good at what they do and are pursuing something they're passionate about. These are women with PhDs, women who are scientists, women who start their own business. They aren't scared of ghosts (except maybe Patty) -- they're fascinated by them! The main relationships involved in the film are their developing friendships with each other, which don't revolve around bonding over - or worse yet, fighting over - men. This film features women who kick ass without showing cleavage or wearing leather, rubber, or spandex -- and you would think, as a lesbian, that I'd be all about those things, but honestly, watching a woman in a vinyl bathing suit trying to kick ass in 4-inch heels is really not my style. How about women actually wearing some real clothes and shoes? I can get behind that. (Not to mention that Holtzmann defies all logic to show how attractive jumpsuits and safety goggles can really be.)Dismiss me if you like, but I have seen it over and over: women have LOVED seeing themselves portrayed this way in this movie -- as people who could either teach physics or build high-tech machinery if they wanted to (and the men I have seen it with have enjoyed it as well, because you know what? Smart, passionate women are awesome). Additionally, queer women of all stripes have been SO excited to see Holtzmann, an unabashedly weird, quirky, queer woman whose sexuality is never explicitly mentioned and is not an issue in the film -- which is just as it should be, since this is how queer people operate in the world all the time. There is really nothing bad about a whole new generation of Ghostbusters fans, boys and girls, being able to see that women can exist in all of these ways, and can be whatever they want.In conclusion, I first went to see this movie with some friends expecting to see something lighthearted and fun, which is exactly what I got. The more I thought about and talked about this film, though, the more I got out of it, and the more I appreciated it. This movie is not a sequel or continuation of the original, and it doesn't have to be. It's its whole own thing. It's an alternate universe where the people who evolved into the Ghostbusters just happened to be female. It has fantastic cameos by many members from the cast of the original, and many subtle nods to the original as well. Go in looking to laugh and have a good time, and you will.",Ghostbusters
1586,j_d0e,"Good movie, not as amazingly perfect as the original!",9,19 July 2016,"Thought the movie was a lot of fun!Faves: Every scene with Kate McKinnon made me laugh, Chris Hemsworth was surprisingly funny and he should do more comedy, also Leslie Jenkins has amazing timing and her facial expressions are super entertaining. Almost as good as the original but way better than Ghostbusters 2.Light Spoilers: SPOILER WARNING!!!!!!!My kids loved that Slimer had a girlfriend, my son thinks this one is better than the original, while my daughter likes Ghostbusters 2 the best because she loves babies. This is a great movie for kids, I had to cover the kids eyes when we watched the original on DVD because of the scene with the ghost undoing Ray's pants. Ghostbusters 2 is also kid friendly.",Ghostbusters
1587,uberbleh,Haters gonna hate...,10,18 July 2016,"Went into the movie with no expectations, and I found it funny and an enjoyable summer blockbuster. Some of the one liners were hilarious: Patty saying, ""That ghost is gonna be the third scariest thing on that (subway) train."" The uncle thinking his car being ""on the other side"" means it's in NJ. Music score was meh. I haven't seen the original in about 20 years, so can't compare it to the original, but I think a lot of the negative reviewers need to get their panties out of a bunch. I didn't hear anyone complaining when the new star wars came out and was almost the same plot as the original. How many times they gonna do batman? I feel like a lot of the reviewers either went in expecting high brow humor and got mad at the family guy level, or are angry manboys in a twist that the ghostbusters are all female. Don't see them complaining that the original were all men. While I feel they should have toned down some of the man ridicule in the movie, it doesn't deserve the vendetta going against it that started before it was even out. These are probably the same ugly misogynists who caused gamer-gate and dump hate on female video game players. I hope their moms slap them upside their heads, cause they clearly need it.",Ghostbusters
1588,shaitan_555,Not worth watching,1,15 July 2016,"I'm a fan of the original Ghostbusters movies and cartoons. I had some of the toys when I was a young boy and I like both the franchise and horror movies in general.This movie does justice to neither. It's not because they chose women instead of the 4 male lead characters. The movie just sucks on every level. The humor doesn't feel real or spontaneous but forced and predictable. The visual effects are terrible. Even the story and dialogue are bland and forgettable. I almost fell asleep watching this, which rarely ever happens to me.Now I know the original 2 movies didn't have the greatest story lines, or the best acting. But they had chemistry, they worked. They were fun and exciting. This movie just attempts to copy the things that made the original ones work but it fails to copy the spirit (pun intended) of those films.",Ghostbusters

1590,rockleegrl352,This movie is AMAZING!,10,17 July 2016,"I just saw this movies today and I absolutely LOVED it! I'm a fan of the originals and this one honestly had the same vibe. The characters were likable and smart. It was honestly so refreshing to see female leads that had some serious brain power. Holtzmann is an instant favorite! I've seen a lot of guys on here whining about how the movie ""hates on men"". No, it doesn't. The men making these statements are the same ones who came on here to rate it before the movie even came out. All this film did, was reverse the roles. The women were the leads and the powerful ones while 2 men (TWO, out of the whole film) were given roles that are 99.999% of the time given to women. If you want a movie with a good story that makes you feel nostalgic all over, YOU NEED TO SEE THIS! 3/4 of the Original Ghostbusters say it's amazing, and I completely agree. :)",Ghostbusters
1591,shimrod20,sigh - this turd landed squarely on my nostalgia and squidged nastily.,1,16 July 2016,"OK, so I was dragged along to see this - Where do I start?? the crap CGI? the forced wooden acting? the gratuitous male-shaming crotch shots? Way back in '84 I took my gf at the time to see the original so I guess I have a lot of emotional investment in the former, but Harold Ramis will be spinning in his grave so fast they could hook him up to the national grid as a turbine. This gigantic soggy condom of a film didn't need to happen. It could have been great but instead of making it like the old one they made it look like 'scooby-doo' on acid, the Misandry and Misogyny of some fans are only part of the problem.

1592,Zabe_T,Good Fun.,7,14 July 2016,"I caught this at a pre-screening the week before its US release, and I have to say, if you like the original two Ghostbusters film, you'll likely enjoy this one. Fun jokes, good nods at the original, and great cameos by the original cast make for a fun time. The pacing is off late in the film, particularly around the big climax, which makes me wonder if the studio edit demanded ""a bigger finish"". This detractions is forgivable with the fun popcorn feel of the remaining film. As a general rule I get annoyed at Hollywood for its reboots, and I had very low expectations when I first heard of this one being done. That being said, the film turned out to contain many laughs. Note: The film does contain a post-credit sequence.",Ghostbusters

Some great cameos from the original cast and some great gags and they aren't slapstick silly gags they are cleverly done I guess you could say its a bit girly since there are girl main characters but there were plenty of guys in the cinema watching it and they seemed to be enjoying it. Each of the main characters has their own personality and so everyone can have a favourite. I guess if you take this movie seriously then you will be disappointed by why would you? the first movie wasn't some serious drama, it was a light-hearted film and this is no different.

I guess I didn't feel the need before, but I do this time to counter all of the negative reviews on here. I don't know what that's about - I thought it was a great movie. I was a fan of the original when it first came out, and this one held up very well next to it. The plot development was continuous, the acting was fine, the humor was there, the action was there. The cameos of the original players popped up at unexpected times. Dan Akroyd as executive producer - what's not to like? It paralleled the original in some ways, and diverged from it in others. Nothing wrong with that at all. Now I want the blu-ray set of all three movies (or is there going to be a fourth next year?). I don't get the fem-bashing of the 4 leads. They certainly hold their own in this movie. But I guess some people just have to do that, for their own reasons. In rating it, I had to think if I gave it a 9 or anything less, what would cause me to give it a downvote? I couldn't think of anything. So 10 it is. I'll be watching this over and over once I get the blu-ray. My only complaint is the woman next to me taking a phone call in the middle of the movie - yes, I told here what to do with that. That turns me off to theaters so much.",Ghostbusters

I enjoyed the movie, it's not 1 o 2 points as other people describe, I found it funny and the role that Chris Hemsworth plays is also something that you won't expect. Still I don't think that a sequel can be done on this one, it won't get enough budget for another movie, but it was a nice try to empower women in the skin of the legendary Ghostbusters.",Ghostbusters
1597,troyfilm,An optimistic throwback film for a cynical world...,9,12 July 2016,"First up, the question on everyone's minds (no, not where Elvis is and how he's doing) - is it as good or better than the original? The answer is no, but not much is. Ghostbusters is a fun, energy- filled film that, while it doesn't capture the lightning in a bottle of the original 1984 film, does have a personality and energy all its own. Rather than replace or recast the original four characters, Feig's Ghostbusters opts to go in its own direction while also giving winks, nods, and even proton blasts to the gut in references to the original film. The cast is wonderful with Kate McKinnon and Leslie Jones being the stand-outs. Production design and visual effects are absolutely incredible showing what a Ghostbusters film in 2016 can and should look like to perfection. The ghost encounters are creepy, the combination of visual and practical effects selling the illusions quite well. Theodore Shapiro's score is also a whole lot of fun, helping balance the creepy with the heroic. The film is not without flaws, the third act happens rather quickly and you can't help but wonder if a few threads to help get you there were left on the cutting room floor. The visual spectacle takes a front seat and the comedy and tension get a little left behind, but the action in the third act is so kinetic and fun eye candy, you don't really mind. This could have easily been a cynical cash-in on intellectual property, but instead is a reverent, well-intentioned and sweet film that does what comedy does best: play absurd situations with complete sincerity.",Ghostbusters
1598,stuarthamill777,Not good,2,21 July 2016,"This is a really poor effort from Sony. They could never equal the original, but at least try and make a good film. Whoever wrote this should be sacked. I paid money to listen to fart and crack jokes. Slap stick humour that made me grit my teeth. I feel sorry for the cast who had nothing much to work with, plus they have to put up with a lot of woman bashing lately. I especially feel bad for Leslie Jones who has deleted her twitter account recently for receiving racial abuse. Her character in the movie is quite good, and not the stereotypical black woman some people have said in there reviews, although the trailer did not do her any favours.The casting of 4 women in this movie has nothing to do with the fact that this movie sucks. They could put the original actors in this and it would still be bad. Aside from the annoying slap stick humour, the movie has no soul. I cant believe it cost 140 million dollars. The CGI is awful. I mean the ghosts are like cartoons. Apart from the 1st 5 minutes there is no horror element. As I said before, the actors didn't have much to go on. Chris Hemsworth was great though. His stupidity was the only funny thing in the movie. Kate mckinnon who I was looking forward to the most from watching the trailers was good fun as she is ab-it mad, although she kind of got a little annoying as it seemed that she was trying too hard every time the camera was on her. Kristen Whig who is in my opinion the funniest in real life among her co stars, couldn't do anything with the awful material, as well as Leslie Jones. I leave Melissa Mccarthy last because I don't like her in anything. In ghostbusters its the same Melissa mccarthy you get in all her films. Loud slapstick humour that is just forced down your throat.As for the director, I feel hes used the woman bashing the cast have received to camouflage how bad the film is. How he managed to mess up so bad il never know. The movie lacks effort. It has no soul or imagination. Im a huge fan of the original which I knew couldn't be equalled, but I tried hard to give the reboot a chance on its own. There is talk from Sony already of sequels. Well I tried get on board with your reboot but that's it from me. Please leave the godfather alone for Christ sake !",Ghostbusters

1600,Blackmorning84,"Can't stand on its own, not as good as the original.",3,16 October 2016,"First off, I don't normally write reviews. I liked the original ghostbusters I and II, enjoyed the cartoon and loved the extreme ghostbusters cartoon. The trailer didn't impress me, but hey I decided to give it a shot. The opening bit with the house tour, I was actually optimistic. Then it went downhill. There was not one character I could relate to. Lets look at them one by one:Erin Gilbert - this is that greenhorn type teacher that no one respects and everyone taking her courses just knows they can ace. This lady acts more like a kindergarten teacher than a university professor. She acts like a female Louis Tulley. Abby Yates - her practical jokes fall flat, like everything is a complete joke to her. Was she just humouring Erin when they were younger? Her naivety when in the mayor's office comes across as infantile. Like seriously what is she, 3?! . Jillian Holtzmann - now here's a character that had potential, the quirky engineer... until she seems to read half her lines and bounces between manic and bored. Patty Tolan - not the worst character, but very stereotypical for a black woman. I think I would have preferred her to be one of the teachers instead. I mean if you really wanna show some diversity, have other than just black and white. This is set in New York, have an Asian person or Hispanic, have someone with some impairment to like in extreme ghostbusters so that there's more inclusion. Don't have the white folk help out the poor uneducated black girl. That doesn't help.The cameos were wasted. They really should have played their original characters, but instead their roles were one-offs that had no relevance to their originals, which means there was no reason for them, but a cheap gimmick. Casper did a better job of cameo for ghostbusters. The actual jokes (one-liners) fell flat. some of the situational stuff was fun, like the failures/growth of the equipment. I think they could have built on that more. The whole bit with the FBI driving away just felt pre-school bully. Just makes you want to smack your head in embarrassment, which continued with the whole mayors office scene. I've seen a lot of reviews that talk about how this show made guys look bad, but hey I think they did an equally fabulous of making these girls look like morons. The whole show felt like I was watching a first rehearsal instead of a finished product. It was like the actors stopped caring about their characters and with writing like that I can understand why. While I was watching, I checked the clock multiple times wondering why I bothered. But hey, I actually watched the whole thing, Twilight only got 20 minutes and Star Wars II got 30. So it's not the worst film I've seen, but its not worth the ticket price. I think that the cast could have done a reasonable job with the right script, but this script wasn't it. I wanted it to be better, I wanted it to be fun and serious like the originals were. But there was no sense of danger with the bad guy. I mean seriously, he made them do disco. He did more damage when he was alive than when he was dead.",Ghostbusters

I have also seen most of the cast in other movies and enjoyed their performances so all should be good for a decent reboot of the classic Ghostbusters. How wrong could you be! After about 20 minutes I started to feel a bit sleepy and almost nodded off! The story isn't that far removed from the original apart from the Sigourney Weaver love interest and the other world gods. I won't even go into he plot as it was rather forgettable to be honest. Save your hard earned $$$ and buy the originals on disc instead. I'm sure it will do well at the box office mainly due to the publicity it has received but it doesn't deserve it!,Ghostbusters

1607,djmarklaw123,Actually rather satisfying. Take it from someone WHO ACTUALLY SAW THE MOVIE!,7,14 July 2016,"Let me first say, I was going to boycott this movie after the terrible previews released. I don't know why I did a turn around and decided to go see it opening night besides boredom. I'm glad I did. Fandom is a hard thing to battle when talking on a reboot of a classic. I went in not expecting much as a fan of the originals and knowing they were going to throw this out the window. So keep that in mind when you see it. The best parts about this movie... It's rather entertaining as a story and has a lot going on to keep the pace moving very well. The special effects were some of the best I've seen in a long time. And the 3-D experience is not to be missed as it adds to the scare factor and things literally jump out at you and even fly past the bars of the film box and towards you. The cameos are also entertaining and that's what the fans of the originals are going to get the most out of it wanting it to tie into the originals. The bad things,... Oh its so hard to think what to start with but I'm going to start with the music. Can we give fall out boy a rest already. Personally I hated every song featured and it really took away from the film with the atrocious tunes trying to make the flick hip. I say use the original song and let that be the focus. Now the movie to me was not funny at all. At best I smirked a few times and maybe let out 2 slight chuckles. Some of the jokes were just down right poor. When you see the flick you'll know what I'm talking about with the 2 different cat jokes. (Outta the bag, and Mike Hat) ugh! Also the Ozzy cameo kinda sucked because it wasn't really even a joke and the fact he yells out Sharron after all that's recently happened made the joke poor. They should have just cut his one line. My least favorite part of the movie, besides the music, was Jillian Holtzmann played by Kate McKinnon. Her character was annoying and just plain weird. Thankfully when she does say something, it's short. But those short statements made me hate her character because what she said most of the time was just stupid and came out as baby talk at certain parts. She dumbed it down and I would have rather the part was played by Emma Stone who was originally picked. There are lots of reviews on here from people who haven't even seen the movie but hate women casts and hate the idea of a reboot when fact is, the original cast was never in a spot to give us that. Be glad we got this cause it's not that bad. I gave it a 7 outta 10. Visually and story driven it was really good and a fun time at the movies. A film is meant to entertain and this definitely delivered on that end. Go see it and get the 3-D cause it's worth it. Definitely changed my original opinion which is what we all hoped for. I get Fandom and the loyal subjects attached. I hated BVS dawn of justice and would give it less than a one because I'm such a big superman fan, but I gave it a chance.

1608,Ultimaterializer,A man-hating mess.,1,18 July 2016,"This movie pushes a clear PC agenda, has very outdated CGI, and both the writing and acting is a joke. All of the men are portrayed as losers or evil, and the movie is too worried about pushing an agenda instead of trying to be an actual movie. Worse yet is fans were promised a remake that honored the original, when this movie manages to insult the original in every way imaginable. It's no accident that Sony had to enact a review embargo to save face, or else this would have made no money whatsoever. I won't get into any spoilers, but rest assured that this is a pure man-hating film through and through, and it's not even a good one. Politically correct movies that push a certain agenda can still be good (Frozen), but Ghostbusters is not an example of such a movie.Save your money and either see something else or stay at home. Even if you *want* to see politically correct nonsense, there are plenty of movies to see that are actually good.",Ghostbusters
1609,paynetb,Terrible Remake,4,18 November 2018,"Stick to the original film. This remake is terrible. With the talent starring in the film, this should be very entertaining. Instead, it is lame, lame and lame.",Ghostbusters
1610,MiniatureGeek,Give it a chance,7,15 July 2016,"So I saw the remake last night, and like many, I wasn't going in with high hopes. Not because of the female cast (I personally enjoy Melissa McCarthy and Kriten Wiig comedies, I had no previous experience with the Kate McKinnon or Leslie Jones) but because of the fact the trailer's comedic moments just fell flat for me. They were fairly low brow humor and compared to the originals dry sarcastic humor it just looked juvenile.Imagine my surprise when the movie started and I was really enjoying it right off the bat. The one thing I haven't heard many people talk about is the horror aspect of the horror/comedy that is Ghostbusters. Now this isn't going to be a movie that ""scares"" people, but it actually does build tension, and the first scene in particular really sets the tone for the horror aspect of the movie. Following that up we get into the character development of the main characters and that's where the next pro for this movie comes in. These are not the same characters as the original just played by women, they are each their own, sure they have similar characteristics, Melissa Mcarthy is the Heart of the group much like Dan Akroyd, and Kat McKinnon is the one who develops all of their equipment just like Harold Ramis, but Kristen Wiig isn't a copy of Peter Venkman, and her character arch is a nice addition to the movie, because in the matter of honesty, their aren't really any character archs in the original. I'm going to go on record and say I was most worried about Leslie Jones because most of the scenes of her in the trailer were over the top, and while she is probably the loudest of the bunch, she does get to deliver some of the best lines of the movie, ""That's a room fulla nightmares"" may be one of my favorites from this new movie. Kate McKinnon however was my favorite, she will most likely not be for everyone, but her weird cadence when she speaks, and her mad scientist vibe worked for me and I really hope this movie gets her more movie parts.Chris Hemsworth might play the most lovable idiot I've ever scene in a movie, his stupidity is so over the top but he owns it, and you can tell he had fun with the role. He gets so much more than the receptionist did in the first movie and it makes for an interesting dynamic. He almost seems like the younger brother that hangs around. It's a weird dynamic and I'm probably describing it poorly but it works.I saw the movie in 3D and I strongly recommend that those who see it go see it in 3D if you can afford to and you aren't the type that 3D gives you headaches. I'm normally not a fan of 3d where things pop out because to me that effect never works, but it really did in this movie. One of the things that helped the effects was the cropping, the movie is played with extra space above and below much like old letterbox movies on VHS, however that space is used for effects to seep out of the main frame of the movie helping the effects to really POP off the screen.Now for the negatives of the movie. Paul Feig likes to write low brow crotch/fart jokes, and weird awkward moment humor, and for me there were a few scenes that could have been better had they not lowered the comedy bar so low. Also I don't know if it was always in the script or if he rewrote it because of the backlash but all of the male characters are either morons, cowards, or jerks. I'm not saying the movie needed a man to come in and save the day, but it just seemed odd. However I'm sure I'm a bit biased being a male, and maybe there are more than a few movies where there are nothing but terrible women in it. All things considered I give Ghostbusters a 7/10 and recommend it too all who like horror comedies. In my mind the Ghostbuster movies will now be ranked, Ghostbusters (84), Ghostbusters (2016), Ghostbusters 2. I really hope this movie does well enough for a sequel because this is a movie verse I would love to go back to. One last thing, there is an after credits scene so stick around, that isn't too difficult though as the credits are a blast to watch.",Ghostbusters
1611,joe_gilham-1,Turned a Classic into a B Movie!!!,1,22 July 2016,"From the very beginning, everything seemed like a low budget movie. They had better design, graphics, and animation in the original 1984 version. One would think that with modern technology being what it is, this should have been able to put the 32 year old original Ghostbusters to shame. Sadly, I kept watching it until the end, in hopes of ANYTHING getting better. Even the jokes throughout the movie lacked any decent punchline to them. I worried when I originally heard they were remaking this film that they would ruin the classic, but I remained optimistic regardless of what my gut told me. I can understand that some, or all, of the original writers from 32 years ago were probably unavailable for this version. However, whoever did write this and whoever did direct this, I beg of you, PLEASE SEEK A NEW FIELD OF EMPLOYMENT!!! YOU SUCK AND YOU RUINED TIMELESS CLASSIC WITH THIS GARBAGE. As for the women roles, male or female doesn't matter. There was definitely talented and actresses chosen to play the lead roles, but unfortunately, even these 4 women (and Chris Hemsworth) seemed like they were acting in nothing more than some skit on SNL. I'm ASHAMED of Hollywood for producing such a disgraceful remake! Hope you are losing your butts big on this one!!!",Ghostbusters
1612,drager21,Kate McKinnon is insane!,9,16 July 2016,"First of all, Kate McKinnon completely steals this movie and proves what I said about her a couple of years ago when they really increased her presence in SNL - she is a comedic genius.From the few reviews I have read, I am finding that people took this movie WAY to seriously. This movie was a stage for 4 of the best female comedians out there to take us down a warped nostalgic trip. Yes, there were many similarities to the previous movie, and that's what was great about it! Enough similarities to remind me how much I loved the previous movies, and not enough to be completely predictable as to what the next scene would be. And the cameos by previous GB actors were perfectly placed. If you loved the previous movies, don't wait to go see this, most especially for one of the craziest performances by Kate McKinnon she has done.",Ghostbusters
1613,crazyspursfan,"After all the controversy, this is what all the fuss was about?",4,25 July 2016,"So Ghostbusters (2016) may go down as one of the most controversial movies of all time. From the Youtube trailer being the most disliked trailer in history, to the eternal twitter wars being fought by both the so called ""SJW's"" and what I like to call the anti-feminist crusaders, this is the result of months of controversy. A mediocre, forgettable film that would have been held in the ranks with other mediocre, forgettable reboots such as Robocop (2014) and Total Recall (2012) had this movie not served as the battleground for ideological warfare.The movie starts on a rather dull note with a joke about queefing and that sets the tone for the rest of the movie. Admittedly this film is not devoid of any humour, Leslie Jones who had probably the worst moments in the trailer, actually has probably the few funny moments in this film all to herself. A lot of the criticism from the trailers was that she came across as a stereotype towards the black community, but she probably serves as the only character throughout the whole movie who is relatable and undergoes any kind of character progression.Unfortunately, this means that the other 3 Ghostbusters played by Kristen Wigg, Melissa McCarthy and Kate McKinnon as well as their bumbling secretary Chris Hemsworth all are 1 dimensional, characters with no real evolution towards their character. And as for the villain Rowan North played by Neil Casey, he may very well be the dullest, most unsympathetic character to grace Hollywood in years, which is a shame because the potential of a bitter man, traumatised by how people have treated him all his life, whilst not the most original idea, has potential to flesh out a character. As for some of the cameos, if you ever need a perfect example of phoning it in, check out Bill Murray's cameo in this because he clearly does not give a damn.Perhaps the fairest criticism of this movie is the use of CGI, it does look exactly like the Scooby Doo movies and the Haunted Mansion movie of the early 2000's, in most movies this would be a disappointment, considering how recent movies like Warcraft have pushed CGI to their limits, but in a Ghostbusters reboot that made great usage of practical effects back in 1984, this makes it all the more frustrating.Overall this movie is a bland, forgettable movie. But it's not a ""man-hating"" mess or ""Feminazi propaganda"" this should just be pushed back into history along with all the other bland to terrible reboots in a bid to force Hollywood to come up with creative ideas in this era of soulless cash ins.",Ghostbusters
1614,garrett-moffitt,Most the reviewer are liars.,9,23 July 2016,"This was an excellent move, and an excellent retelling of the same premise. The act is well done, and the script is also well done.The CGI it excellent, the many little detail through the movie where surprising, and I found several scenes laugh out loud funny. They did not try to replicate the Murray/Ackroyd/Ramis/Hudson energy, and that's a good thing. The created their own energy.It was as entertaining to me as the original was when it came out. Different, but just as good.On a side note, I find all the 20/30 year old haters who weren't even alive when the original came out hilarious in their ignorance.",Ghostbusters
1615,benhalkum,Sigh,2,13 July 2016,"Before I get into specifics which may or may not contain spoilers, I want to get this out of the way. Younger kids will enjoy the new movie. There are a lot of things going on, goofy moments, and other things that kids like. I foresee the movie being a good way to introduce new toys and other merchandise that kids will want.With that being said, as an adult and a fan of the originals... trying to take the bias thoughts of being a fan out of the equation, this is not a Ghostbusters movie by any means.This movie plays out like a poor parody of The Ghostbusters, and would have been better served by not taking on the namesake and being marketed as a similar movie in the same genre with a similar story. I was literally sick at my stomach during and after the movie to even think this could be associated with the original property in any shape or form.THE MOVIE: This was a forced comedy with forced winks that were unclever and honestly gave no addition to the enjoyment of the movie itself. Too many aspects of the movie were overkill. From the overabundance of CGI and non interesting ghost, to a new forced joke every few moments, I found myself just sighing.I feel like the director wanted to really wanted to create his own vision but felt that if he didn't force everything upon us it wouldn't sell. That is where he made his mistake. The backstory, what little bit there was, was boring and skipped over anything that could be remotely entertaining.The nods and forced comedy were mediocre at their best. The overall storyline played out in what was a disappointing first act, alright second act, and very underwhelming third act in a movie that seemed to go by quickly, but not quick enough.THE ACTORS: I LOVE Kristen Wiig, Melisa McCarthy, and Leslie Jones. All three of those women are terrific actresses and very funny.Just not in this movie.Kristen Wiig was annoying. her character made me sigh every time she opened her mouth and the role was just so irritating I kept hoping she'd just be killed off. I feel as if she was supposed to be the Peter Venkman type of character for this movie, and they failed horribly.Melisa McCarthy's characters was annoying and immature. The jokes they had for her were some of the most forced and her true comedic performance could never shine through as she delivered what I can only imagine were lines she just wanted a payday for. This is by far the worst role I have ever seen her in and it may have turned me off of her for a while.Leslie Jones. Type-casted from the start. She plays the same role she ALWAYS plays but damn it, I wanted something different this time. I wanted her to take this major role she's been given and give us something we haven't seen before. The writing for her... man... I would have rather they kept her part down to the size they gave Ernie Hudson in the original movies than force her to be so up front with how ridiculous they wrote her. She was bland, not funny, and quite sadly given a ""token black character"" role. Shame on you Sony. Shame on you.Kate McKinnon. This is the one person I was NOT familiar with at all going into this, but also the most interesting of the 4 core actresses. She played her character amazingly. The little things she did and how she delivered her lines were just entertaining and felt organic. If there is a stand out performance for the movie, it's this woman.With that being said, the supporting cast was more entertaining than the main cast (sans Kate). Chris Hemsworth was great and gave me a chuckle a few times during the movie. Bill Murray's cameo was good but too short lived. And nice nods to the other originals.Except for the main bad guy and the tour guide who started the movie out. Those guys annoyed me every scene they were in. Terrible, TERRIBLE acting. The characters were horrendous, and I think they had a major part in ruining the entire movie experience for me.THE NODS: The nods to the original were good, but mostly forced as previously stated. Bill Murray was the best of the cameos, Ernie Hudson was only in the very end with a very predicable role, Dan Akyord was just a few moments and felt out of place with his dialogue. Nice to see the original actress to play Jeanine as well as Sigourny Weaver. That was quite a surprise for me. The Staypuft Marshmellow Man cameo was great.Too many other forced nods. The theme music played like 5 different times in 5 different ways. The firehouse was forced, just none of it needed.OVERALL: Do not pay to see this movie. Wait till it's on TV or Netflix. Or take the kids to it. If you do go to see it, go in with the thought process its another bland comedy but in a ghost catching genre. Do NOT go in with ANY expectation that this will come close to touching anything in the Ghostbusters universe.",Ghostbusters
1616,Dreaminalongtime,Really disappointed,1,11 July 2016,"Boy was this disappointing. I seriously can't believe they rebooted another classic franchise, and not only that, but it was insulting and terrible. Not to mention the politics behind it.Just couldn't enjoy it. Oh, and the special effects and acting was really poor. Lots of hamfisted and ""quirky"" jokes too that just weren't funny. Not intelligent humor. Kids might like it, I guess.Even the plot was just a rehash, and they didn't even do the ghosts right.I don't know why they didn't just go with practical effects rather than CGI. The ghost ended up being a pretty big guy, and actually I was discussing this film with someone after and when I brought up the ghost they said ""for you"" and I didn't really get it.

And that's it.It's racist (token black person), sexist (they only have Chris Hemsworth because of his looks) and feminist propaganda (gender- swapping roles and shooting a ghost in the genitals). It's poorly written and the effects are too ""Scooby Doo"" quality, and that's not a good thing. Do yourself a favour and don't see it. Go watch the original two Ghostbusters films and the Real Ghostbusters cartoons instead.

It's not the best movie ever made, but it does what it set out to do, and it does that well. Most of the hate from this movie is coming from 1) people who have never and likely will never actually watch the movie, 2) people who pretend to be fans of the original but don't actually know anything about it (or apparently realize that it was also composed mostly of SNL cast members), 3) people who went into the movie desperately hating it and looking for reasons to justify their hatred in an effort to pretend to be less sexist than they actually are. Or some combination thereof. Let's face it: there's no reason to give this movie a 1/10 that isn't sexist. There's no rating system in which that rating is justified and reasonable. There just isn't.

1619,adrix_2,Call them again (spoiler alert),8,22 July 2016,"So i was very curious about this one. First of all i'm a huge fan from the originals and when i saw the first trailer i was a little worried but them things where coming together until those really awful commentaries came along.It's the movie that will make your life worth it?! No! It has a great story and Oscar winning performances? No! Of course not! It's just a fun, action and sometimes a little spooky movie.I loved all the cameos from the original cast. It was so ""sweet"" to see them again entering that world if just for a little. And also Slimmer (i guess) was fun to see again.OK, some jokes were off and could be excluded but the cast do it's best with the material they have and they seem to enjoy it has i did. And Crhis Hemsworth?! What a perfect joke. Instead of having the clichéd big boobs blond girl stupid we have a guy making that role! It was hilarious!I also enjoy the fact that was pretty surprisingly scary. The beginning in the haunted mansion. That basement was damn scary. The action its almost all in the final act which is very awesome e full of CGI. Please see it in 3D| What a ride!!About the cast being all women. I really didn't have a problem with that but it lack some male strong character. Someone more serious.Resuming Ghostbusters it really has good intentions and tries to pay a sweet homage to the original but it lacks more stability and more mature jokes that can be enjoyable to more people so that we can also relate to them and the characters.Love to see a sequel, maybe with another director and making it more reliable.Go and watched just for the fun of coming back again to this ""universe"" that most of all love so much since the first one",Ghostbusters
1620,xtimewarpx-1,Genuinely Funny and Enjoyable to the Point that Some Men Apparently Can't Handle It,8,9 August 2016,"I saw this movie this past weekend and thoroughly enjoyed it. When I came onto IMDb however I had no intention of writing a review of it. I simply wanted to check a minor detail about the film's production. That's when I saw the numerous unjust reviews left totally trashing the film and deliberately trying to make it sound much worse than it actually is. I will tell you right now that all of those reviews giving it one star are meant to purposefully bring down the film's rating and make it look bad, and they're all written by whiny entitled men who can't face the fact that an all-female reboot actually managed to be genuinely entertaining. I'm not kidding when I say that this movie managed to get me audibly laughing by the very first scene, before any of the main characters had even shown up. And the laughter didn't stop there but continued throughout the entire film, with each of the four leading ladies landing their fair share of jokes. So all those reviews saying this movie isn't funny are lying to you because those people can't admit that women can make jokes too. Now in regards to all those complaining that the special effects were too embarrassing to watch, I just want to point out that the special effects of the original Ghostbusters were nothing to write home about. But nothing about the quality of special effects in either movie really takes away from their ability to entertain. So if you can sit through the original 80s Slimer scene with no complaints than you shouldn't have anything bad to say about the effects in this movie.Next, complaints that it doesn't do justice to the original are just more lies spread by fans who can't put on their big boy pants and accept that a reboot actually had some merit. This movie has enough nods to the original to keep fans happy, but also has it's own original story . All of the cameos from the original cast were great, and I'm not gonna lie, I felt a certain wave of excited nostalgia whenever the original theme song was played during a scene.Lastly to all those people complaining that the movie is ""sexist"" and whining over how the only major male character is reduced to a dim-witted piece of eye candy, I would just like to say that in almost every other major blockbuster movie the roles are reversed. Other movies contain a slew of interesting and adept male characters while only throwing out one or two sub-par female characters who are then forced to pander to the male gaze. When almost every other movie puts men at the center, you'd think it wouldn't be that big of a deal to switch the roles just once. I personally found it wildly refreshing to see an action comedy starring four very different and very capable ladies. All in all I found this movie funny and refreshing. I highly recommend it and encourage you to ignore all of those looking to down-vote it just because they can't admit that four women managed to make a movie that holds its own in comparison to the original classic.",Ghostbusters
1621,whitnai678,Not perfect but certainly does not deserve all the hate,6,27 July 2016,"This movie was by no means life changing but it landed some solid laughs. The main cast worked well together and the references to the original sprinkled through out the movie were great! Kate Mckinnon (as Jillian Holtzman) and Chris Hemsworth (as Kevin) were definite fan favorites but everyone was well cast. The plot was definitely not perfect; it would not be difficult to find holes. However, the movie never dragged and was fairly enjoyable from start to finish. The story was cheesy, fun, and altogether not a bad way to spend a couple of hours.The trailers to the movie did not do it justice and unfortunately many of the reviews on this site (several of which were written without the reviewer having seen the movie) do not either. Some jokes fell a little flat but the audience in my showing of the movie certainly seemed to be enjoying it. To everyone that feels as if the movie is sexist because the female actors held the majority (if not all) of the good roles: this movie was not made for you. If you are interested in seeing a male centered movie in which the female characters are all either sexy love interests or cold calculating shrews then you should spend your money on almost any other movie.",Ghostbusters

Indeed his character was stupid and I didn't like him but this character wasn't against man, it was just stupid one and we met his kind in almost every sitcom before e.g. Big Band Theory's Zack, Two and a half men's Jake etc. etc.. So what's the problem?A lot of people called this movie a pro-feminism one and men would hate it because of that. No it's not a really pro feminism movie and unfortunately the characters stick to popular clichés e.g. Patty. Well, she is black, but why couldn't she be a scientist? Nope, a scientist needs to be a nerd and has to be white. Too many clichés for my taste but despite that I loved Holtzman.The bad guy was worse and the plot thin.

Wish I would have seen it in 3D. The movie is pretty family friendly with only some off-color humor and scary parts. I liked the emphasis on girls and science because we need more role models like that for our daughters (there is only so much Disney Princess a parent can handle). What's (sadly) interesting is the movie seems to have anticipated the pathetic whiny reaction it was going to receive from certain unhinged segments of the population (think Gamergate) and directly addresses it. pretty brilliant.

1632,cferretrun,Formulaic and Enjoyable addition to the Franchise,8,18 July 2016,"First, I'd like to open this with a reminder: Ghostbusters films are not produced to win Academy Awards. They're not produced to top the charts with the most incredible special effects that CGI can produce. They're not produced to be record-breaking box-office cash cows. When you try to hold a modern rebooted rendition of anything (music, film, book) to it's original; you're setting yourself up for immediate and immense disappointment. So from this point forward I will not be drawing comparisons to the originals. This movie can stand alone without having to struggle out of the shadows of the original films.Ghostbusters 2016 introduces the audience to the typical four- flavored team of individuals hungry to prove themselves, validate their work, and most of all- validate themselves in a world that consistently overlooks them. Holtzman was the most welcome of the four with her quirky, outlandish, and dryly sarcastic humor, but Erin and Abbey anchor the quartet with a mixture of fun, awkward humor and dry wit. Patty is the necessary injection of realism in an otherwise heady group of scientists with their heads in the clouds and their sights set too far towards the horizon.True to the Ghostbusters formula, you mix a cast of varying appeals, styles of humor, and ambitions into a skeptical dog-eat-dog world where a delightfully cheesy, over-the-top reprobate of a villain is attempting to unleash the apocalypse upon the city. Add in the expected stylized special effects for the ghosts and city-wide catastrophe, our Ecto-1, and an immensely difficult uphill battle to reclaim the city while throwing out witty one-liners, sarcastic quips, and you have yourself a Ghostbusters film. True to its franchise, it expresses itself in an over-done way of comedy and humor slammed into an unrealistic city-wide end-of-world scenario and garnished with special effects, the array of expected equipment, and even splashes in a few modern pop culture references to keep it cohesive and consistent with today.You'll see many familiar faces, and a couple of tributes to those that were no longer with us in the franchise. Keep a look out for the numerous homages paid to the original films, because they're there in abundance. Overall, Ghostbusters had me laughing, smiling, grinning, and even yelping out loud with the other moviegoers around me for a couple of the playful jump scares. As an avid fan of the original films, and a fan of its newest installment, I would challenge and recommend anyone who has reservations to give it a chance. Lower the unrealistic expectations. We have seen some terrible reboots, yes. But we've also seen some great ones.Give it a chance, you'll be pleasantly surprised.",Ghostbusters
1633,PilewskiAlex,The response this film has received has been dispiriting...,7,16 July 2016,"This movie was pretty funny. I laughed out loud. Several times(!). It wasn't great but also wasn't trying to be. In my personal ranking of Paul Feig comedies I'd probably order it The Heat < Ghostbusters < Bridesmaids < Spy. Was this, as other reviewers have likened it to, a man-hating monstrosity? No. Far from it. Do I think this movie would have been improved if it cast, I don't know, Chris Pratt, Anthony Mackie, Paul Rudd, and Miles Teller? Maybe... but certainly not definitely.I'm glad this version of Ghostbusters exists and Sony had the guts to risk rebooting such an (apparently) cherished property with women. I find it really really sad how many men have taken to trying to tank this movie's IMDb rating / wider perception out of spite and I sincerely hope the smear campaign doesn't prevent other studios from making more ""daring"" casting choices in the future.",Ghostbusters
1634,yujinmoto,"No Spoilers: It might be fun for people into low-brow humor or little kids under 10, but no one else",1,17 July 2016,"And this is certainly not saying that this is ""the Worst Movie Ever"". Certainly not. I've seen worse production quality before and as far as certain elements in the movie are concerned, it isn't beyond mind-numbingly bad as people might think. However, that being said, a good movie is a complete picture, not a broken picture with a few good elements tossed in. I like looking at the product AS A WHOLE and stepping back a few paces and looking at it with objective eyes, I don't like what I see. Maybe I'm just not into unsubtle, low-brow, slap-stick, toilet-quality humor in films, but I feel that this particular trope has been WAY overdone by Hollywood and media in general. There are just no subtle comedies anymore, just the same old over-the-top, in-your-face crud that lost its appeal years ago. And if this had been all, if the executives at Sony just let all this hate and emotion play out without getting involved, just simply let people voice their frustration and impatience at such lack of innovative creativity, they might have gotten off the hook with this one. Unfortunately, they stoked the fires intentionally just to promote their film. Instead of relying on creativity, or developed characters or a good plot or awesome CGI effects, they simply relied on hate. This mean-spirited marketing was not in tune with the original Ghostbusters (1984) campaign when they promoted scientific curiosity in the supernatural and the natural wonder of CGI. They exploited the best, not the worst, of the audience. It is what made it a classic that was special in the hearts of all people, not just millennials. And now, 32 years later, seeing what this franchise has devolved into makes me want to completely shut out mainstream Hollywood altogether. Not to mention that Sony has a history of unethical practices (buying good reviews: http://www.cbsnews.com/news/sony-pays-for-fake-reviews/; Blackmailing celebrities: https://wikileaks.org/sony/emails/emailid/104704) in their entire production and have basically shut out all rational, educated discourse in favor of polarizing controversy and hatred. This is a company I cannot support, which is why I cannot support this film. It's more or less my disgust at Sony rather than a disgust at the less-than-stellar quality of this film that is making me give this a 1 rating, and that is me being honest. I agree to disagree, but my mind is made up and I have spoken.",Ghostbusters
1635,phuries,Wow!! Such haters!,8,18 July 2016,"So many people seem to forget that the original Ghostbusters (one of my favorite movies of all time) was simply a 'fun' movie. Crass jokes and cheesy one-liners were the rule of the day. This movie was FUN! Kate McKinnon was a blast. It wasn't intended to replace the original, it stands alone. As far as I am concerned, it stands strong. While it may be true that most of the male characters in the movie aren't 'heroes', I don't see why they have to be. In the original Ghostbusters, Louis was portrayed as a love-desperate nerd, William Atherton was a complete bureaucratic jerk, and Gozer ends up to be a practically naked female with 4 inch heels. To say it is appallingly sexist because they hit the ghost in the crotch to get him to let go of the buildings and because they hired a male receptionist based on his looks? Really? People have too much time on their hands if they have to analyze their 'entertainment' this way.

Unfortunately, we realize very quickly that the scenario is bad, absolutely no team chemistry within the Ghostbusters (they have nothing in common), scenario is quite bad, I am also not convinced by the actor play, and worst of all the movie is full of misandry. I get that they wanted to make a movie with girls, but all the male actors are belittled during the movie one way or another.

I loved the fact that the lead roles were women. No it's not sexist for one movie in every five years to highlight strong women and heroines that aren't sexually objectified. Yes it was hilarious that their secretary was a male. Most movies are just the opposite. So those of you hating on this movie without listing out any notable issues other than you can't stand that it doesn't cater to your arcane misogynistic values you really should get a grip and evolve a bit. I loved the fact that they brought back some of the ghosts from the original GB and feel it's a total classic. I greatly appreciate women in strong roles and I certainly don't have to be a feminist to not appreciate woman bashing sexists!! This was a refreshing change from the stereotypical male dominated hero movies! It's humorous and entertaining and Melissa McCarthy was great.,Ghostbusters

My boyfriend and I both found the movie well written, refreshingly lacking in reliance on tired stereotypes for its humour, with amusing and well timed throwbacks to the original, in keeping with the tone of the same. Not exactly Oscar winning, but good, solid, family appropriate, fun.

1640,yogiofthespokes,Tired of the sexist hate against this film,8,14 July 2016,"Ghostbusters ReviewPositives -An overall funny film that manages to stand up on its own in terms of laughs. Several quick one-liners keep the laughs going throughout the entire film, starting with the first lines of the opening scene -Despite what people (fukboys) were trying to claim, the female led cast prove they are just as talented if not more than the guys. These characters were not female versions of the original group, with each one carrying their own personality and characteristics -Kate McKinnon is the real stand out, with her quirky mannerisms and oddball antics keeping the comedy train rolling from the moment her character (the brains behind the devices seen in the film) steps in -While not necessarily scary, the effects used to create the ghosts is extremely impressive and marks a very noticeable improvement since the 80s -Most importantly, the movie is fun. During the climatic act three battle between the Ghostbusters and an army of ghosts, i literally felt a sensation of happiness wash over me. Double points for Kate McKinnon being the person on screen when that happened -Nostalgia plays into the movie, but is only partially slammed down your throat (more on that later). These come in the form of subtle little nods. The team being unable to afford the original firehouse (Rent is 21,000 a month), the appearance of Slimer as well as everyones favorite marshmallow manNegatives -Nostalgia overload. Having a few subtle jabs and prods at the original is one thing. Having literally every surviving cast member of the original team (minus Rick Moranis sadly) make random cameo experiences is another. I have nothing against cameos, mind you. But it took away from the film, making me wonder Hey Who is going to show up next instead of focusing on the movie. -Not That Scary. Despite being mainly a comedy, the original Ghostbusters had some decent scary moments, mainly with Zul and those demon dogs. The reboot has some moments that could be scary, but the comedy defuses the tension -Weak Ass Villain. Speaking of Zul, Zul was a boss villain. Which is something the remake lacks. We are given a stereotypical loser creepy guy who just wants revenge on society. Which is weak. -Hemsworth. Hemsworth's dumb but pretty secretary character (an obvious jab at the female equivalent) plays a gag that quickly becomes tired. It isn't until the Third Act that the Kevin character becomes a more important piece in the plot and the gag ends. OVERALL SCORE: 8/10. A solid, funny movie handled well by a powerful female cast but doesn't quite live up to the mammoth expectations shadowing over it by the original. Also, screw the meninist losers who went on IMDb days before the movie even premiered and wrote bad reviews without giving any details as to why.",Ghostbusters

I have to say...I'm really surprised at the animosity guys seem to have for this movie. Reading through some of the reviews, a lot of you guys haven't even seen it and you're justifying your negative comments under the guise of how sexist and racist the movie is. I guess haters are just going to hate. That said, I thought Ghostbusters was fun. It wasn't awesome, but I definitely want to watch it again and would buy the bluray when it comes down in price. There were some moments that were a little too slapstick for my taste, and I didn't think Kevin brought anything to the movie, but otherwise the narrative was exactly what you should expect from a Ghostbusters movie: hazy ghosts, pseudo science talk, quips, slime, and a one dimensional villain.Kristen Wiig felt a little flat in her portrayal of Erin, and it was nice to see Melissa McCarthy NOT acting like Chris Farley, but Leslie Jones and Kate McKinnon stole the show as far as I'm concerned. All the cameos, tropes, and nods to the originals played well and felt good overall, and the last scene of the movie with Ernie Hudson made me laugh out loud. Lighten up guys.

I grew up with the original Ghostbusters movies and was unhappy that it was being rebooted with no connection to the originals. I had no problem with the gender of the new cast. I find all four leading ladies to be very funny and was optimistic until I saw the trailers proving what a train wreck that was about to be experienced. I avoided watching this in theaters because I know I would probably end up walking out when I saw how terrible it would be. I decided to give it a chance when it showed up on a movie channel and sure enough, I ended up absolutely hating it. The cast was fine, but the story was terrible, the jokes were lame and it honestly felt more like a Ghostbusters parody on SNL than an actual Ghostbusters movie. The originals were funny, but they both had scary and memorable moments that forever reside in my mind and were made as serious movies. This abomination had none of that. I watched it once, and I'll never watch it again.",Ghostbusters
1645,troy-young71,Is it funny yet?,3,20 July 2016,"I went into this movie trying to ignore all the internet hate that it seemed to generate. I make up my own mind and c'mon; it has Melissa McCarthy in it so it can't be that bad, right?? Wrong. Oh so wrong. To me, it felt like there was no chemistry among the leading characters and every attempt at humor was very forced and flat. It didn't have any of the camaraderie of the original Ghostbusters at all. I did like Kate McKinnon's character, though; she seemed to be having the most fun and she made the scenes with her in them the most enjoyable to watch. Problem is that her enthusiasm just didn't permeate the rest of the cast, which is sad because there was so much potential. I kept waiting for it to be funny, but it just never really happened. (To be fair, I also didn't like Ghostbusters II for many of the same reasons. Just wasn't as good as the original) The cameos from the original GB cast were okay, with Dan Aykroyd and Annie Potts being the best in my humble opinion. Sigourney Weaver's was pretty good, too, now that I think of it. The special effects were outstanding, I will give it that much, but then again special effects are pretty easy to create nowadays. There is a teaser at the very end after all the credits are done rolling so if you go to see it, be sure to stay.",Ghostbusters

There were a few parts that made you jump a bit and many more that made you laugh out loud. I particularly enjoyed the ones that referenced all the trolls.

Yeah, it was over CG'd but they're ghosts!* I enjoyed the plot since watching the build up as each team member joined, seeing the ghost problem escalate and the wondering at the villain's character develop kept me interested.* Stay to the end of the creditsSure there were flaws but nothing major and I'd love to see enough woman-led action movies that we stop noticing the gender of the protagonists and just enjoy the movie.

Several original cast members have cameos that reference their original roles in creative ways and there's a homage to Harold Ramis. The ghosts/effects are well done and include some recognizable characters. The main characters- Abby, Erin, Holtzman and Patty are hilarious. Holtzman has a fantastic scene that made my inner- 8 year old want to start planning my Halloween costume around her.

I really liked the fact that there were a lots of wink to the originals: like the marshmallow man, the original actors who did some cameo, etc. Also, the 3D was really good!I think that the movie deserve a chance, but you shouldn't compare it to the original if you really liked them.",Ghostbusters

The comedy and humour was not horrendous and I laughed out loud in more than one place, I especially think Chris Hemsworth's part was hilarious.

But Kristen Wiig, Melissa McCarthy AND Kate McKinnon in one movie? I was willing to take the risk. And honestly, I laughed. Not my a** off, but I laughed. That is the point with comedy, right? And the important thing is that I wasn't bored and was entertained throughout the whole movie. I mean, come on! This movie is not worth a 10 - not by a long shot - but is certainly worth a lot more the 5! Kristen Wiig's character swooning over Chris Hemsworth was kind of silly to say the least and Kate McKinnon's character was a bit cartoonish but still managed to get the most laughs. Some of the lines felt forced and lame, others were brilliant. But, honestly, that is still better than most of the comedies nowadays that can't even deliver a couple of good lines to save their lives. I do feel that the cast had a lot more comedic talent than what the script allowed them to show through. I can see that the problem for most people is the ""remake"" part. But I loved the original and I loved this one. The only thing they have in common is the premise of New York getting invaded by ghosts and a team named ""Ghostbusters"" manages to save everyone. That's about it. It did not feel ""blasphemous"" at all.

If the makers come out with a sequel (which I'm hoping for) I hope they will develop the characters & story line a lot more. The ridiculous character role and casting of Chris Hemsworth says a lot about what movies used to be like & how it was considered perfectly normal.

1655,sforzando_films,Bustin' Makes Me Feel Good!,10,17 July 2016,"Despite all the negativity that trolls from all over will try to spew to overshadow this movie, this movie is actually pretty darn good! I wouldn't say that it is better than the original, but I can definitely tell you that it is way better than Ghostbusters 2. And that's a pretty big hoop to jump through in my opinion. Let's talk about the cast and the chemistry between them. They are all fantastic and very funny, and you can tell that they were all just having the best time on set. Not only that but there are several unique qualities about each of them that really make them stand out. Erin is the very analytical calculating one, but also incredibly awkward (especially when she is around Kevin). Abby is kind of a cross between Venkman and Ray. She's cocky but also brilliant with a giddy fascination over the paranormal, just like Ray. Holtzman is... Well I would say she's the Egon of the group but she's very unlike Egon in many ways. She was hands-down my absolute favorite. She's got way more of a gutsy attitude and you should see the things that she invents for the group. That's another thing that I loved about this film, the gadgets. As a Ghostbusters fan I have been craving to see more gadgets and weapons for the Ghostbusters to carry, and this film gave me exactly that: more cool weapons to use on the dead. Getting back to the characters, Patty was definitely one of my favorites for one particular reason. She's obviously supposed to be the Winston of the group, but Winston never contributed to the group the way Patty does. Not only does she provide the car, but she also provides a lot of intricate history about New York. She's a massive history buff, and her knowledge proves to be pretty useful and informative. This is what I ultimately loved about this film, it tries new things. Sure there are a lot of homages to the original and a LOT of cameos, but besides that and being called Ghostbusters it doesn't try too hard to essentially copy the original. The story is very similar in many ways, but you could argue that all Ghostbusters films (and even the video game) follow the same sort of formula. Plus this is the first of what will become an entirely rebooted Ghostbusters franchise, which I am very excited to see. So hopefully they will not do like they did in Ghostbusters 2 and use basically the exact same formula for the plot. Hopefully they will shake it up a bit, but I'm pretty optimistic.

They are funny and amazing all by themselves but together it is golden! Paul Feig is the best at bringing funny people together and have it work to benefit the comedy as a whole. In short, it doesn't feel like it was written by one person who had only one sense of humor. This reboot give a new generation something to be thrilled over and maybe go looking for the original and be pleasantly surprised. So let the haters hate and enjoy a kick ass movie with your friends.

The amount of negative reactions to this movie is ridiculous, while most reviewers deny the fact that they don't hate it because the main characters are female the opposite is sadly true. The second the all female cast was announced, it released a s*** storm of epic proportions. I do believe there is a very mean misogynist movement since the backlash first started and carried on through production, certainly reared it's ugly head as soon as the trailers came out and now it has continued through opening weekend. There is a segment of the ghost busters fandom that is very varied and had existed through decades. There is a sense of ownership that is among male fans that came out even when the project was announced and even members of the press were:""this is kind of a guy movie isn't it?"" So there is a feeling that this movie belongs to guys and specifically belongs to guys who grew up with it. Well guess what Women also grew up with it so no it doesn't just belong to you and it seems the fanboys never actually grew up. There is no excuse for all the hateful comments the cast received not to mention the racist misogynistic comments Lesslie Jones received. It is absolutely fine to don't like a movie and give it a poor rating but can you at least watch it before all the hating. I strongly dislike the twilight franchise, I read the books and saw the movies and only after that I formed my opinion, I thought it was all horrible ( Buffy would kick Edward's behind) Ghostbusters had one of the lowest scores ever before it even came out so how do you justify that. Last Saturday my friends and I went to see the movie. I loved it, my friends loved and so did the rest of the audience, male and female.

This cast is stellar, they have wonderful comedic timing and improv skills, and I feel sad for any man who is so butt hurt over them being female that they can't enjoy it. I think my favourite comment was, ""Every man in this movie is either stupid, evil, or eye candy."" OH MY GOD, you mean like basically every woman in every movie EVER? Further than that - this movie isn't for men anyway. This is for every little girl who hasn't been brainwashed to think science and action movies are only for boys.

1663,afaber12,Is it the original? No. Is it perfect? No. Is it an entertaining movie that pays homage to the past? Yes!,8,17 July 2016,"It would be easy to say that all the negative reviews out there for this movie (GB16) are complete garbage, that they're part of some weird conspiracy to ensure that GB16 fails, and in so doing somehow preserves the original. It would also be incorrect - though it does seem to apply to some of the more extreme ones out there. It also feels unfortunate that I have to declare this in a review, but it seems necessary: I'm a man, and I'm also a fan of the original Ghostbusters movie (GB84), less so of II. Despite that, I enjoyed this one, and would be cautiously optimistic to see sequels with this cast.When the movie was announced as being a reboot, with an all-female team of Busters, I was concerned. That concern didn't come from the new team being all female, but from the new team not being the old team. Given that I was 1 year old when the original came out at the movies, I don't actually remember a time in my life where I hadn't seen it, and don't remember the first time I saw it. In no way perfect, and with several references I wouldn't get until I was at least 12 or 13 (or if my parents are reading this, I still don't get) I loved it. All of which meant that anything that came after it was going to suffer in comparison unless it was somehow perfect. (Just look at II.)As I alluded to in the title, this isn't a perfect movie. There are a couple of gags that feel forced or left to run a little long. There's what you might call ""background entertainment"" during the closing credits that I suspect may have originally been part of the main movie but was thankfully relegated to where it is now, which actually helped pass the time during the credits for those of us waiting to see whether there was a post-credits scene. There are one or two failures of logic when you go back and think about it - and I don't mean the movie's paranormal science logic, just the real world stuff. And yes, a couple of the CGI effects, particularly towards the end and the effects are fullscreen, are a little rough around the edges. But at the end of the day, the movie did it's job: I was entertained the whole time it was running. I liked the new Busters. Though there are similarities to the original, they aren't lifted wholesale and stuck together in a mish-mash, they are changed to suit the new story and characters. And it for me it manages to find the right balance between telling a story and not taking itself too seriously while doing so. Slight spoiler, though not a story one, the cameos feel nicely timed. I think for fans of the original they may take you out of the movie for a bit, but for the new generation that will watch this first it probably won't matter, and for fans like me it was nice to see and felt like a blessing to continue.For people new to the franchise I think you'll enjoy it. For fans of the original, you should enjoy it too, just remember that ""different"" doesn't mean ""bad"". And know that if you genuinely don't like this movie - or refuse to watch it for whatever reason - that Peter, Ray, Egon and Winston, along with Dana, Louis, Janine and Slimer will still be there for you: Sony didn't acquire every copy in existence of the original and destroy them. You still get to choose who you're gonna call.",Ghostbusters

The one scene I was shuddering about being in the movie most was cut and moved to be a credit sequence which was PERFECTLY placed compared to where it was set to be originally.Great nods to the originals throughout. Characters were well done. Melissa McCarthy was a little more low key which suits her so well vs. the over-the-top BS she always makes. Kristen Wiig continues to be an honest to goodness actress that I enjoy, Leslie Jones acted more than I expected vs. loud and in your face the whole time (though there was plenty, I thought she could do nothing else walking into this), Hemsworth and McKinnon steal the show.Still some cringes, but they're quick to win you back. Compared to the disappointment I had been expecting, I was pleasantly surprised at the ride as a whole and that it was a solid movie from this die-hard fan's view. (They'll never get a siren as good as the OG. That noise still gives me goosebumps to this day because of how much it meant to be back when). Parenthesis aside and without question, I wouldn't hesitate to see the next one.Saw it in RealD 3D and it was designed to have things from the movie go outside of the letterbox which was VERY cool for this movie watching the beams and such actually punch through the confines of what appeared to the be screen space. See it, and see it that way. Feeling fairly relieved - the franchise LIVES!",Ghostbusters
1667,johnellis3,"A good, fun movie if you want to give it a chance",8,17 July 2016,"First I want to address all of the negative reviews and press this film has received. While it is by no means a masterpiece it definitely does not deserve all of the 1 and 2 ratings it has received. I have seen MANY bad movies over the years and believe me, there is no way this is a 1 or 2. That being said, it does have some problems. I do think that they should have gone with a different title or even a subtitle and there are some flaws such as over reliance on cgi effects and some jokes that fall a little flat. Other than that this movie stands up to the classic two ghostbusters movies just fine. Don't believe the negativity on the internet, give this one a chance!",Ghostbusters

And before people are going to batch the fact that Melissa McCarthy will be the same character in every movie. In this movie she's not (I won't spoiler but I can say there will be no jokes about her weight, since in other movies she's played in, they like to joke about). It's a funny movie with great visuals. A movie with a lot of links to the old Ghostbusters.If you want to see a funny movie, this one is. Don't read the negative reviews (I don't want to make mine to long, since I don't want to give spoilers).

I mean, sure the graphics would be better, but I felt it was unnecessary. And then I heard the ghostbusters were going to be women, and I was sold.I can't even remember the last time I saw a film with more than a single woman. Let alone four of them, let alone a woman who's intelligent, who's following her dreams, who get to eat and be gross and wear professional, fully covering clothes and tie their hair back sensibly.I don't even know how to articulate how I feel about this film. There are no fat jokes, no sexist jokes, no dick jokes. As a white woman I can't comment on any racial problems but I felt like I could fight anything, even the horrifying specter of patriarchy, with three friends wearing jumpsuits.If you identify as female, please see this film. If you identify as male, see this film. And when you get irritated over Kevin, or the other male characters, watch the original ghostbusters.

1672,cortomaltese79,Mediocre and lame,4,27 July 2016,"I went to see this movie with a sorta open mind: I acted (as Walter Peck, while I also gave my voice to Slimer and Gozer) in the Italian musical version of the original movie, which I'm certainly fond of, but let's be honest: a moviegoer has to experience the movie as it is. And sadly this movie ain't no fun. It isn't scary, nor entertaining. The jokes all fell flat, the CGI is cartoonish, I saw no real chemistry in the GB team, and the (mostly ad-libbed) screenplay sounds clunky and dully expository. Is it the worst movie I've ever seen? Not at all, as most people would tell you: but they will also add - and so will I - that's not good either. It isn't even better than the feeble GB2: that one has real characters, at least (Yanosz, for instance, looks like a complex and cogent Bad Guy compared to this flick's villain: and that's saying a lot!), and a sort of an amused vibe among the main characters. All things that this movie has not.

But if there are going to be all these bizarrely negative votes, I am going to bump up my rating to counter some of them!All of the women were funny. Melissa McCarthy was cute and held the audience. There were some flat bits, and the film lacked a solid B- story line: there were no love interests, no sick mothers, no weird housemates, no jobs outside of ghostbusting - nada. It made the movie a little predictable.However, the special effects were great and there were some fun moments. If you have a kid aged 12-16, they would love Ghostbusters. For the adults, Leslie Jones was fab, really sassy and funny, and Kate and Kristen both had time to shine.Also, holy heck, Chris Hemsworth. I loved the way he and Paul Feig sent up that old 80s trope of the secretary so silly she can't even work the phones. It seemed to be in every second movie when I was a young kid. It was so on point and quite intelligent. NOT MISANDRY. NOT AN ATTEMPT TO PUT DOWN MEN, just good fun with a bit of a deeper message.The best scenes: when the Ghostbusters are testing the equipment in the alley; some of the banter between them all; the demon ghost at the weird day concert; and the credits. More Hemsworth. That was worth half the ticket price alone.",Ghostbusters

The women in this movie are hysterical. I was gasping for breath and smiling the whole time. And do you know what? So was the entire sold out audience. We applauded at the end and stayed through the credits (I recommend doing this). I plan to go see it again, something I haven't done since Titanic.One thing I love about this movie is there is no stupid love interest, no women running in heels, no damsels in distress.

1675,pavel-butsenov,Great comedy,10,18 October 2016,"I honestly did not expect much from the movie, as I heard a lot of skeptical remarks. It was said to be man-bashing and not funny. Having seen it I can definitely say, that this is one of the best comedies I have seen lately. It has a good story and a perfect amount of built in nostalgia.The first thing I liked was the cast. Seeing Melissa McCarthy I realized that this thing could actually be funny. Kate McKinnon, with whom I was not familiar before created a Doc Brown kind of character and she really brought him alive in the most hilarious way. The Leslie Jones is also great. Chris Hemsworth as an idiot is brilliant. All in all you could really not get a more generic and contrasting woman characters as these four, each bringing their own flavor in. There are a lot of story parallels to the original series in the movie. I am not sure I agree all of them were necessary. The name GB and short appearances of former franchise cast members would have been more than enough for my taste. Granted, there is some gender based comedy. But in my opinion it is just hanging in the air as none of the characters are man-haters as far as the script goes. But whatever, I guess they had to put it in there to please our dear women audience.My final remark is that there really aren't enough good women comedy actors out there. And it gives me real joy to find new ones. I am looking forward to next sequels, and this one is definitely going into my comedy collection.

I don't understand how this movie got a one star from most of the reviewers on here and I think it is ridiculous, this movie did not deserve a one star.

Even in this context, I was unable to finish the movie and decided to instead stare at the ground.The characters lack any excitement whatsoever and feel as though they were written as a bad joke. The acting was suspect. Possibly a director issue? I'm really not sure. I like most of the actors individually on SNL and find them entertaining, but in this movie I can't think of a single character with any sort of depth or intrigue.I've only ever turned off 3 movies in my life before I could even see the end, and this was 1 of them.

I thought it was funny, I liked the characters, I thought it was a great homage to the original. This is a movie that, through satire, calls out some of the sexism that is common in movies. I read one of the negative reviews and it totally missed the mark, I think because the reviewer apparently does not recognize satire. There is an amazingly beautiful, incredibly stupid and useless male in the film. That character and the way the main characters interact with him is some pretty biting satire. It is a role reversal of SO MANY female employee/male boss portrayals made just enough over the top in comparison to many mainstream Hollywood films to show it is satire.

1681,lungfish-1,What went wrong?,4,10 September 2018,"The first time I tried to watch this movie, I didn't make it past about the first half hour. Nothing hooked me in, and I got bored and frustrated.Giving it another chance with a second viewing, I found that it was entirely lacking at whatever level and genre you might think to approach it. I agree with what many have said -- I didn't laugh once. You have so many cast members, even beyond the four top stars, who have proven themselves to be good in other comedic roles. It makes me wonder why none of them could even manage to pull something out of a scene or situation to yank in a bit of an improvised gag that would at least make you chuckle. There's just nothing there. No physical comedy, no slapstick or even predictable jokes, and certainly nothing dry.So who was it that caused everything to fall flat? Was it the writing, the directing, the editing? Did the producers have an aversion to anything remotely interesting or funny? I understand that when you are in the moment performing it is tough to see the big picture. But these are four women who have done plenty of other movies, sketches, and been successful. Even giving them the benefit of the doubt leaves me wondering whether they could sense that nothing was landing right.I don't want to line up too many comparisons to the 1984 original, but that movie delivered some really dry comedy and provided more background to the characters, the build-up of the story, and that just seemed to be missing here (or at least what was here was an afterthought).",Ghostbusters

Although it does in fact play out in a similar way as the earlier Ghostbusters, I think it really stands out and makes an impression. And, Star Wars XII copied the first movies, but for some reason that wasn't such a big problem? To be honest, I think most of the bad reviews are based on the fact that there are mostly women in the movie and most of the male characters are pretty dumb. Say whatever you want, but sexism in male movie-goers is REAL.It was refreshing to see a movie with four cool women who played well, had a funny script, and had nerdy/smart characters to play. And also the fact that love (or, relationships with men) wasn't the main focus.I laughed through the entire movie, it was funny from start to finish. I could relate to the characters and personally I loved how they referred to the previous movies.If you haven't seen the movie - I recommend you to go watch it. But I would like to encourage you, if you do dislike it, to really - truly - think about why you hate it. Because it's a reboot? Or because it's a reboot with women? I would have loved to have these kinds of characters and movies to look up to when I was younger. Children need this movie, I needed this movie. I needed Ghostbusters with women and I needed it told as if they the women were just as smart and strong as any man before them.Say and think whatever you want, but Hollywood is changing. And if you're going to hate it, hate it because the script sucked or because the acting was bad. Don't hate it because it's women playing.

I've seen it countless times and it remains one of my all-time favourite comedies. Having said that, I find the sequel lifeless and forgettable. Superfluous, even. I am absolutely not indiscriminate.And yet I liked Paul Feig's 'Ghostbusters'.I really liked it.Yes, the trailers were lame. Whoever cut them made me want to not see the movie; they really did not do the movie justice. In fact, most (not all) of the gags that fell flat in the trailer worked in their proper context. Even some of the reheated ones.The cast was pretty good and they had an excellent dynamic. I was most pleasantly surprised by Melissa McCarthy, who isn't all shouty for once (think Ray without the naiveté), and Kate McKinnon, who plays a smart, creative, quirky and bad@$$ chick.Yes, there are plenty of small bits that I could have done without, including the gimmicky arsenal, the product placement, some of the cameos, an over-the-top, action-heavy finale (as well as Hemsworth's part in it), amongst other things.But I had a really good time. And, seriously, I would see more of Feig's 'Ghostbusters' if they made more. I would love to see where they take it from here, how the characters evolve, and how they develop the concept.

The CGI, which I didn't care for in the trailers (The disparity between the finished product and those trailers is a little shocking), worked really well with the 3D and had some spookily beautiful moments.

Regardless, my daughter and I went to see it and loved it. The version we saw was in 3D and it was great. It's been a long time since I've seen a 3D and the improvements are fantastic. It was funny and we loved the cast and the story. I was hoping they wouldn't try to remake the original and it's nothing like it. Obviously there are some similarities but it's different enough to see it as 'not a remake'. I loved that they included the original (minus Rick Moranis) especially the tribute to Harold Ramis.

I'm old enough to have grown up with the original, and while I love that film, it is also not without its flaws (think about the constant day/night shift while the Ghostbusters are heading to battle Zuul - this is just basic filmmaking! Is it day? Is it night? It's maddening.). There are very few perfect films in the world, and the original Ghostbusters is not one of them. So why are people putting it on this untouchable pedestal?Ghostbusters (2016) is a well executed comedy starring four incredibly talented comedians and a very funny Hemsworth (he's in a category all his own). There's literally nothing to hate about this film unless you hate good, funny things.

1691,Ewok_Soup,A very funny and very terrible ghostbusters movie,5,16 July 2016,"I really wanted to like this movie. I really did. And I did like it more that I thought I would. But sadly it wasn't enough. To be clear, I went with negative expectations. I didn't like the trailers one bit.The ghosts I didn't like and the humor wasn't working for me either, so what was left? The story? Everybody knew the story was going to be something similar to the original. The thing is, the trailers have the worst jokes of the movie. Literally the worst ones. The nickelodeon-type green vomit... the classic ""make fun of the badass hero line cliché""... the black woman being all ""Hell no!"" and ghetto about everything. That being said, I laughed out loud several times during the movie. And, as big of a fan of the original as I am, let's be honest, you don't laugh out loud very much on those. Is not that kind of humor. Is more of a ""Have a smile on your face the whole time"" kind of humor. This one has great jokes, great writing, and very good performances by all the main cast. Although Leslie Jones is still a little too ""Hell no!"" for my taste. But is balanced by the surprisingly hilarious Chris Hemsworth. The actual ghostbusting wasn't that good. Except for that McKinnon bit, which was as good as everything McKinnon did throughout the movie. So, in my opinion, you have not so good ghostbusting stuff filled with good jokes and funny performances. A movie with this dialogues and cast would have been great if only they would change the whole Ghostbusters thing.No matter what people say, this movie definitely isn't a less than three stars movie. That's just fan hate.",Ghostbusters
1692,tripp007,Just as great as the original!,8,18 July 2016,"Being a fan of the original Ghostbusters movie all my life I went into this movie with high expectations. Within the first 30 minutes I knew that it was going to at meet those. By the hour mark it has surpassed them. The movie was filled with actually great jokes, fantastic chemistry between the girls, and a villain that was actually well fleshed out. There is a sequence near the end that actually made me giddy to watch, and I will definitely go see this movie again. The people bashing this film have NO idea what they are talking about. This movie was everything a Ghostbusters movie should be. Chris Hemsworth especially surprised me by how funny he could be, and the cameos from the original cast were especially awesome to see throughout the whole film. I can't wait to own this when it comes out on DVD! GO SEE THIS MOVIE!",Ghostbusters
1693,kaitlinbledsoe,The sexist reviews are in; and mine isn't one of them!,10,13 July 2016,"Ghostbusters (new remix) spoiler free review:The perfect tribute to the Old Ghostbusters!Still an original storyline with just the right amount of old happenings. All the ladies were fantastic!The cameos were spot on minus one; and one didn't get enough screen time (in the opinion of some; not necessarily mine). One cameo was shown on TV in an ad spot or sneak preview, and some felt like that was the best of the bunch. Others felt like it wasn't enough of a cameo for the old Ghostbusters actors; I felt like they were all perfect as the movie wasn't about them anymore; it was a reboot. You can't have a reboot with too much screen time taken by the old actors.Some feel that the amount of jokes got tiresome, and that they were trying to hard to fit the jokes all in. Again, not necessarily my opinion.Chris Hemsworth is the most badass dumb handsome secretary I've ever seen. I would like to keep that pretty face around my office too ;)Edited to add: after sleeping on it, I was very happy to realize that there is no sexism towards women in this movie! No being told 'you're women, you can't fight ghosts!' Only: 'you're a scientist...you can't believe in ghosts!'I anticipate this being extremely popular this weekend once reviews are out! And will be going to see it again.I felt the IMAX 3D version is a must to see it, and added to it for sure! Spend that extra money for this film!My rating: A+",Ghostbusters
1694,kirsten-artemis,Great fun,10,30 July 2016,"It's more or less the same plot as the first Ghostbusters (in the same way that The Force Awakens is more or less the same plot as A New Hope), and it's just as enjoyable. And, the Ghostbusters themselves are four women who are intelligent, funny, brave, loyal, determined, and completely kick-ass while remaining fully clothed and avoiding cat-fights. The cameos were mildly distracting but very welcome, and it was great to see supernatural entities having cameos, as well as the human characters. This film didn't just pass the Bechdel test; it smashed it into dust.A film like this was well overdue.",Ghostbusters
1695,knsoulreaver,Saw It For Free And I Still Want My Money Back,1,1 April 2019,"I want to preface this with the fact that when I went to see this, I left all my biases at the door. I wanted this to be a good movie. Having said that, this is my review:There is nothing redeemable about this movie. It did absolutely nothing for my opinion on it. There was barely anything funny or amusing. The few things that were 'funny' were almost immediately followed by something that sapped away any smirk I might have had. Kevin the secretary was the least funny thing in this schlock, even bordering on insulting.Rowan's motivation was overwhelmingly simple. He wanted to bring the ""fourth cataclysm"" because was that he was picked on and teased and saw this as a way to get back at everyone. There are hundreds of other things the writers and directors could have picked that would have been better and, more importantly, relatable. If they would of gone with an idea like he wanted to bring back a dead relative, that would of been better. However, what really bothered me was that he gained the powers of Gozer from the 1984 Ghostbusters simply because he killed himself.Even the ghostbusters themselves were terrible (the characters, not the actors.) Every one of them seems to be written to be the comic relief and fails. At the end scene, they just seem to have commando fighting abilities even though there is nothing to indicate they could carry themselves in such a manner.Overall, the comedy in this was virtually non-existent. The characters were laughable, but not in a good way. Finally, the plot was paper thin and unbelievable. I honestly believe that this poor excuse for a movie could only be found good by the lowest common denominator of the general public.",Ghostbusters
1696,lxhford,Hilarious Movie - Ignore the Misogynist Trolls,9,9 August 2018,"This movie is hysterical & only has a bad rep due to internet trolls. I can watch it again & again.

1697,Daithi-orian,Who You Gonna Call?,8,19 July 2016,"There has been a lot of hate and bile directed at this movie, most of it long before a single scene was even shot. My advice is to make up your own mind. It definitely doesn't desecrate the original (which had more than a few issues of it's own). There are plenty of nice nods to the original Ghostbusters and some fun cameos. They also get to have some fun with some of the trolling the movie has received online.Far from being a shot for shot remake with a different cast, this is a movie that stands on it's own. It's obvious that all the actors involved got to have plenty of fun with the script. There might not have been anything to immediately rival some of the iconic scenes from the original, such as the library ghost or 'that' dream sequence with Bill Murray. It's also obvious that very little of the movie was shot in New York, which is a shame but understandable given how expensive it is as a location. Hopefully this is something a sequel can rectify.The standouts in this movie were Kate McKinnon and Chris Hemsworth. Most people are probably only familiar with Hemsworth from the Marvel movies but he gets to have some fun here, especially in the end credits scene.My suggestion is to ignore the vitriol directed at the movie and go into it with an open mind. Who knows, you might even enjoy it.",Ghostbusters
1698,Slimer-has-no-GF,Should have done GB3 instead. Minor spoilers!,1,11 July 2016,"In the 80's GB was huge! It had subtle humor, great quips and one liners. And even some scary scenes! It was played straight and serious and the guy's weren't in on the joke.This film misses that point entirely! The Ghostbusters are in on the joke. Between Patty screaming most of her lines in an attempt to be funny. Making the males dimwits! (Poor Hemsworth) and the ridiculous dancing number by the cops in the later part of the film, and overall cheesy slapstick humor, with outdated references and blatant sexual jokes. You can't tell who this film is geared too. Not kids. Not the adults who grew up with it. Not current teens? Who?You also have the unoriginal concept of the Ghost Logo being a villain, and false nostalgia draw in of having the original GB's come back as cameo's that are NOT even their characters (Even having Ray be corrected on the Who you gonna call bit?) This was a nightmare!They even hint at Zull for a sequel just to keep pushing forward the lack of original thought in this film. Let's not get into the although brief scene in the film of Slimette. You know so Slimer can have a spin off! Maybe with wife and kids! Wait for Redbox or Netflix IMO!",Ghostbusters
1699,magickalmale,What did you expect?,7,3 August 2016,"I do not see how this movie was feminist. I also don't see how someone can claim stereotype on another race when we all can be loud and obnoxious. I saw the trailers. I knew what to expect. This movie wasn't the best. It wasn't Laugh Out Loud Funny or a Must See. These words on the trailers are always used for every comedy ever released. We all should be used to that by now. So the Ghostbusters are women. Big deal. The way everyone acted. claiming feminist propaganda - that was stretching it. Everything was flipped for this movie and everyone lost their minds. Chris Hemsworth played the dumb secretary guy and that wasn't okay for others who had seen the film. Why? How many times have we witnessed women play a pretty but dumb secretary and no one even thought twice? But a man does it and that's a man hating thing? I thought the movie was okay. It wasn't the greatest. All the funniest scenes were shown in the trailer (I wish they would stop doing this for all films) so there weren't many laughs outside of that. It won't receive any awards or anything like that. Yes, some big things were changed such as Slimer and his girlfriend? The original ghost made an appearance but only for the sake of doing so... it trips and squishes the girls. These were all just cameos. I won't own this movie. All in all, it was okay.And that was that.",Ghostbusters
1700,milliehar,Amazing film!,9,21 July 2016,"So, it's the film that practically no one has looked forward to (except a select few, including me). The fact that there was more content being added to the Ghostbusters universe thrilled me so much, and the fact that it was an all female cast? Makes a change for once.The plot was good, it kept you interested and wanting to know what happened next, and I personally didn't find myself getting bored at all, which does sometimes happen during films. You can see a lot of thought had been put into it, with interesting moments where you go 'OOOHH!'.There was good humour in it, with me giggling a lot and occasionally literally 'laughing out loud'. Some kid friendly jokes and a few sneaky adult jokes thrown in to get you laughing. It isn't just a funny film either, there were a few heartfelt moments where you appreciated friendships.The characters were all lovable, my favourite being Holtzmann. The way the four leads all interacted with each other made you jealous for your own friend group to be like that. They made jokes with each other and were just general bad-ass ladies when it came to kicking those ghosts' butts. Kevin, their receptionist, was a lovable 'stupid' character. He was the 'dumb-blonde woman' in this film, expect, of course, he is a man. How about that, stereotypes? There are also lots of homages to the original, a load of fun cameos, as well as a lovely tribute to the great late Harold Ramis. If you were a fan of the original, you'll be a fan of this one, trust me.Overall, I'd definitely give this film a watch! Ignore all the people who are saying it's a sh!t film when they haven't even watched it yet. You go see it and make your own opinion. If you don't like it, that's fair enough! We all have different views. But in all honesty, this was genuinely an amazing film that me and my family loved. Definitely a new favourite!",Ghostbusters
1701,veritas4747,Great Reboot of the Original-Don't believe the haters,8,24 July 2016,"Personally, I really liked it. I thought it was a good reboot of the original. I admit there are parts I liked mainly because I'm coming from the female experience. These parts may make some men roll their eyes. However, women have been rolling their eyes at overly ""manly"" moments in film for decades, so I won't apologize and I'm glad the people involved in the film (including Ackroyd, one of the producers) haven't.There's no replacing Ackroyd, Ramis, Murray, Moranis or any of the beloved original characters. However, I don't believe they were trying to here. If they had to make a female version, these are the best female comedians right now and I don't think they could have done better for casting. To better understand the negative hype, I even re-watched the original movie right after and I certainly laughed harder at the new one. I also noticed that some character moments in the 1984 film aren't consistent. So, although it is a good film and deserves its praise, don't believe the haters who are a little too starry eyed about it & are just trying to make a point against this new one. Trust that the original cast and creators thought this was good enough to release after all these years.",Ghostbusters

The main characters were bad-ass, smart and funny; so much so that they made the whole cinema laugh countless times throughout the movie.I would definitely recommend this movie for many reasons, one being that it's the first I've seen like it in terms of casting; but mainly because it was so extraordinarily entertaining from start to finish.

1705,SunScot,Like being a kid in the cinema all over again. Loved it!,9,20 July 2016,"I remember seeing Ghostbusters (1984) for the first time as a wee boy. I wasn't old enough to be allowed to go to the cinema but as soon as I could rent it on VHS, I did. By the time Ghostbusters 2 (1989) came around, I was straight there to see it on the big screen. They were ridiculous fun and I've been a fan ever since.When I first saw the trailer for Ghostbusters (2016), I admit that I wasn't impressed. It just didn't land what it needed to for me but then I find that with many trailers from the studios nowadays (Batman v Superman immediately springs to mind here) and I was concerned that this was going to be another Charlie and the Chocolate Factory - a decent cast and a bunch of money thrown at a reboot/remake that should never have been green-lit.Then the critics reviews started to come in and the opinions of friends I trust on this stuff started to come in and I decided to give it a chance. I'm REALLY glad I did.I think it's really good. It strikes the right balance of slapstick comedy and clever dialogue. It makes some great nods to the original cast and movies. It feels familiar and faithful without being derivative and stale. Yes it could have done some things better (Leslie Jones is under utilised and some of the interactions seem a bit awkward at times) but overall the cast and crew have put together a Ghostbusters film that appealed both to the adult and the child in me.Head immediately to your nearest showing and see this. It's well worth your admission money. As an added bonus you'll even be able to afford to buy snacks at the cinema with all the money you'll save on drinks because the tears of self-proclaimed ""fans"" (many of whom have not even seen this film according to some of the reviews left on here) are on tap for free.",Ghostbusters
1706,jaquesmirage,Excellent Movie despite all the penishurt reviews,8,17 August 2016,"First: I'm a Man. I'm 27. And I absolutely loved this movie.I might as well say it. All the hate the movie is receiving is either because of gender politics (poor men hurting) or by some overly serious nerd who thinks the originals are immaculate (although I'm not sure if those are separate things anymore). I mean, look at the IMDb data...it's very telling when you check the demographics.The movie is great. It's funny, refreshing and A GRATE HOMAGE to the original Ghostbusters. Characters are relatable. Kate McKinnon as Holtzmann is perhaps one of the coolest, funniest, empowering representations of 2016: crazy, female super engineer with awkward social skills and mad fighting moves? YES PLEASE!! People saying the movie is sexist are probably the same kind people that believe that there is such thing as reverse racism. They are mad because the movie just reproduces, through INTELLIGENT SATIRE, the same conspicuous objectification women have suffered for decades. Lets be honest: the all female cast kicking some balls is what bothers you. You're not missing Bill Murray's flat awkward jokes from the 1984 version. You're mad because this movie is about you, your mysoginy disguised in a ghost metaphor, and 4 kick-ass woman geniuses with lasers busting you in the balls.The only reason I'm giving this movie 8/10 is because 1: Soundtrack is pretty lame. The new song is very very bad. 2: the cinematography and effects are somewhat conservative. Nothing really exciting there.Also (SPOILERS ALERT) The sandwich scene at the end is one of the greatest comedy gags ever. Brilliant.",Ghostbusters
1707,tommymo23,I Wanted to like it,1,24 May 2017,"Despite the ironic last line in the movie being ""It's not terrible"", this movie was terrible. I started watching the movie knowing the poor reviews it received and was hoping since my expectations were so low that I would find something to like about it. I found almost nothing that I liked about it. That's unfortunate because the cast was a group of stellar comedians. It's almost like the writers tried very hard to make them not funny.The story was choppy and had me disinterested throughout the entire movie. The only thing that kept me watching was for the potential humor that I knew the cast could breakout at any moment. That moment never came. The movie couldn't decide whether it wanted to be an exact copy of the old movies or a brand new take on the whole idea. Unfortunately it ended up being somewhere in the middle and failed miserably in the process. I went into this movie with an open mind thinking that most of the bad reviews were written by people that didn't like the change from male to female lead characters.

1708,psyniac_123,Internet hate machine proves to be wrong.,7,12 July 2016,"Ghostbusters 2016 is fun. It is NOT a sequel to the original, nor does it carry the same tone the majority of the time but it shouldn't be expected to. And it proves pretty early on that it doesn't need to. As a huge fan of the series, I breathed a sigh of relief and wore a giant grin about 20 minutes in when Erin, Abby and Holtzmann celebrated their first ghost sighting with so much passion because I shared that excitement. This film was going to be good and it was.It's not without it's fault; some jokes fall a little flat here and there and the villain doesn't really get enough screen-time. At it's worst it feels like a Ghostbusters fan film but that's nothing to be ashamed of because it is. Positively brimming with love for the series, Ghostbusters 2016 pays homage (and parody) to it's history maybe a little too much but it ain't afraid to do things differently. The characters have a surprising level of depth to them, the story is logical and well-paced and the whole film is gorgeously colourful (interesting, considering the ghost are far more menacing).Ghostbusters 2016 is refreshing and exciting and I'm glad to say I enjoyed it thoroughly.

When I discovered this was a reboot I was, needless to say, disappointed, angry and upset. That was just me being a complete fanboy. I finally accepted this and eagerly awaited the release of the first trailer. Like so many others I was gobsmacked at how shockingly bad the trailer was. It was like an SNL spoof. The pacing was all wrong. Up until seeing the film on its first day of release, I was still very much 50/50. Who wouldn't be after watching THAT trailer? I saw the first showing at a local cinema because I couldn't handle the anticipation.I'm so glad I was pleasantly surprised. What a relief! The film exceeded my expectations. Within the first 5 minutes it felt like a Ghostbusters film. It was fresh, but familiar, in terms of pace and tone. I was worried this was going to be the Melissa McCarthy show, which works for other films. Each character had equal prominence and was great in its own way. Together they had excellent chemistry and were believable as ghostbusters. Nearly every line was funny and there were so many little quips that were easy to miss.

Yes it is like the original, that's the nature of a re-make. But the characters are not clones of the originals, if you are expecting a line for line re-make that's not this. Of course there is a similar story line (again: remake!) Brilliant cameos from the original GB stars, including a sweet nod to Harold Ramis near the beginning. (Stay for the credits to see one more!) The special effects are well done, and it's scary but not too scary for the older kids. The one thing I would have liked to see is for Leslie Jones' character to also be a scientist.

There were at least three transitions that were rough. It messed with the flow.I really appreciated the variety of women characters in this film. There was no ridiculous costuming. Conversations focused on ghosts. The women were smart and funny.But the really delightfully unexpected moments were in the ending credits. Whoever put those together deserves an Oscar. There was a post-ending scene buried in the credits that hinted at a sequel (or implied that this new one was the prequel to the old one.) And there was interplay between ghosts, props, and the text of the credits that was so clever.I'm 57 so I've been to a lot of movies. There are always a few people who sit through the credits. This time, almost the entire audience sat through the entire credits, laughing with delight. When it ended and the screen went dark, we all sat there another minute, hoping for more.

You can't really watch this movie without ultimately comparing it to the original movies. And, they are stylistically very different.The new movie does not take itself seriously at all. The actors are constantly doing bit humor throughout, and the smaller vignettes can be very funny. But, it's like trying to use a series of sketch comedy episodes to tell a single story. Whereas when I think of the original movies they seemed more like a single cohesive story in which the actors simply found themselves in funny situations.The acting was all very well done, and the humor bits worked well by themselves. The fact that it played as a series of sketch comedy episodes to me ultimately detracted from the whole.If this particular set of actors had their own new story vehicle that was not trying to rework a beloved set of stories I think they would be much better served. It's really hard to reboot a franchise that was done so well in the first iteration. And, they did a good attempt, but you can see where at every corner the script tried to borrow from the original but do it just a little bit differently. It just happened too many times to not be noticeable.Since the acting and humor were good I want to give the movie a higher rating. But, because the script just doesn't seem to stand on its own, and it just doesn't compel me to want to re-watch the movie like the originals I find myself marking the movie down a bit.",Ghostbusters
1717,leigland,Lots of laughs,7,16 July 2016,"For context: I'm a mid-40s male who is still a big fan of the original Ghostbusters, and took the family to see the reboot tonight. In our showing in Seattle there were about 150 people in the audience and roughly 80% of them were laughing loudly multiple times throughout the movie. The remaining 20% were quieter (or maybe hated it), but shrug, can't please everyone. Lots and lots of jokes, most of which worked well enough for full audience laughs. Most of the audience was clapping as the movie ended and credits rolled. I'd say most fans will really enjoy this, and a few will hate it. All four of the primary actors did a solid job. Leslie Jones is both funny and smart. Melissa McCarthy plays both funny and 'straight man' to the others throughout the movie. Kristen Wiig plays funny+uptight well and Kate McKinnon steals just about every scene she's in. Chris Hemsworth is a bonus playing the dimwitted secretary Kevin and while I get the if-the-genders-were-reversed-that-would-be-sexist outcry from some folks his general cluelessness is pretty damned funny.The cameos from the original cast members worked for the most part. There's a too-quick homage to Harold Ramis that made the entire audience gasp and then cheer, and it set the stage for each of the other cast members to eventually make an appearance (minus one, which I won't spoil). Oddly, Bill Murray's felt the most forced and was one of the least funny (short) parts of the movie.The final 20 minutes of the movie did go into special effects overload but its heart was in the right place and it got the story across the finish line.I'm giving it a solid 7 of 10 for laughs, good heart and being true to the spirit of the original.

Which to me are the most boring mind numbing movies I 've ever had the displeasure of watching. But back to Ghostbusters. It was campy it was funny it was all it was supposed to be. And it made sense because if anyone who knows anything about the paranormal, spirituality, and the metaphysical knows women have the monopoly on all that. While the first was great made with great comedic artists, this one made sense. And the team of actors had great timing together. The young people who didn't like it have been poisoned by all all the new shows about the un-dead.

1721,nuitsblanches,"A decent new take on an old favorite, very good entertainment with a good mix of slapstick, tongue-in-cheek fun, and big- boom action",7,19 July 2016,"Not a 10-star movie by far on most criteria, but an honestly funny movie, with good special effects, truly ""scary"" parts (OK, more startling than scary but well-executed all the same), lots of self-deprecating jabs, and jabs at stereotypical movie/cultural clichés. Low-brow and slapstick humor, as well as more subtle jokes, fun cameos, fun references to the original movies. Is it an imitation of the first GB? Yes, of course it is, but I don't understand the criticism to this: it's a fun remake of the original, with many twists and turns. Of course, the plot, some scenes, characters are going to look similar, it was done on purpose. Is it crass commercialism, lack of imagination...? It did not appear so to me, just a bunch of writers taking the old original movies, and putting their own touches to it, and produce a 2016 version of it. I didn't feel that the characters always meshed 100%, might have hammed it up over the top at times - but i also felt it was part of the theme of the movie - over the top. Unlike most all the 1-star critics of the movie, I was certainly NOT offended by any depiction of a vapid male: and I'm a guy. There has been million female counterparts to his character, and this was obviously done as a caricature - and well done. I also don't understand the criticism of the special effects. I'm a fan of big CGI movies, and i certainly didn't find fault with this one: ghosts, battles, crazy weapons... it all worked together well. I saw the movie in 3D, I'm not a big fan of that (because prescription glasses interference, mostly), but it was well done, added to the ""depth"" of the movie, and the intended startling scenes worked, and got me jumping out of my seat. No complaints there! The soundtrack only partially worked for me - no problems with the sound effects, perfectly meshed with the CGI, but the new take on the famous theme was not always welcome - might be because we're so familiar with that original that any variation sounds surprising. Still - nothing abysmal that would deserve a 1-star rating.So, in conclusion, not the movie of the year, but a decent new take on an old favorite, very good entertainment with a good mix of slapstick, tongue-in-cheek fun, and big- boom action, well worth paying full pop to view in the theater.",Ghostbusters
1722,processminimal,Watch it!,10,1 August 2016,"I honestly don't know what's wrong with trolls. This movie was very entertaining, total fun to watch from the beginning. It also had some spooky bits. I've seen so much worse that I'm utterly speechless with the bad reviews and sexist attitude. I'm giving a 10 because trolls and sexists suck. Only thing I found a bit too much was McKinnon's character and I normally love her! She overacted a bit and could contribute her unique character a little more. The rest of the characters are fabulous but they all blend really nicely together (at the end of the day, Mckinno's character is supposed to be a bit more 'mystique' than the others and that unravels in the powerful scenes she has at the end- which I didn't really enjoy as I found them over acted.

1723,groovymoviegirl,Yes!!! More please.,8,15 July 2016,"I love the original. It's a classic. I was worried that this new Ghostbusters wouldn't live up to my expectations (kind of like Ghostbusters 2 was for the first one) and even put a damper on my childhood, but then slapped myself and released the ghost of fear from within. As a person who's studied comedy and performed improv, I completely 'get' this movie. It is funny. It is worth your hard earned money. It has some excellent lines, zingers, and stupid wha?! kind of lines.1. The characters are themselves. This is amazing. Each person is their own individual, fun self. They are real people being their authentic true selves. I wish this movie had been longer simply to add more depth to certain characters and to see more of their authenticity. 2. There are some great lines, some silly lines (especially from the bloke, or eye-candy Kevin), and some just completely out there stuff. I especially love the bust of the great one. (When you watch the movie, you'll see it and appreciate it all the more). 3. From some reviews here, which is why I'm writing this now, I think that people are in fear. Perhaps fear of laughing at funny stuff. With that said, as a judging viewer, not everything clicked for me personally, but that didn't take away any enjoyment of the movie. For the record, I've watched way too many movies and TV shows, so I know a dud when I see one. This isn't one no matter how many fearful people have ""chosen poorly"" when providing a proper rating. For those ranking this movie a 5 or lower (especially those 1's), they obviously take life way too seriously and are way too biased to really see how brilliantly funny this is. But hey, don't take my word for it. Go watch it in 3D. You will laugh. And, if you don't laugh, then maybe your Fear Ghost is lurking in your soul. Slap it out and relax.",Ghostbusters
1724,davep22000,Excellent,10,14 July 2016,"What a wonderful movie!Warm and great fun, that takes a much loved franchise and does its own thing while remaining true to the spirit of Ghostbusters. These are no mere female versions of Venkman, Stantz, Spengler and Zeddmore, they're very much brand new original characters who are just as likable and appealing - if not more so.Wiig and McCarthy form the heart of the movie but they are wonderfully generous in allowing their support plenty of moments to shine; Leslie Jones Patty is terrific and easily avoids the tokenism accusations that were always levelled at Ernie Hudson's Winston as her background working for the New York subway and knowledge of the city very much gives her her own unique set of skills and knowledge. Andy Garcia and Chris Hemsworth are also given scene stealing roles with plenty of laughs.But it is Kate McKinnon who absolutely steals the show; her engineer Holtzmann is an electrifying force of nature and utter randomness whether with dialogue or just reacting in the back of shot, she just fizzes with presence.Don't let those who have pre-judged this movie for their own agendas put you off, this is a great popcorn movie that leaves you with a grin on your face.

I should also say, I'm a Redditor (with measly karma) who was dumbfounded by the blind aggression that the first trailer seemed to attract. In my view, it was cowards, threatened by women, who use the cloak of anonymity that comes with being a Troll, to say sexist things under the guise of artistic critiquing. *mic drop*With that out of the way, my review of the film is pretty simple, I loved it. The acting was great, it was well written, directed and produced. The laughter barely stopped in the cinema we were in. No one walked out or demanded their money back for the simple fact that this is a good movie.A few highlights were: Chris Hemsworth, tastefully done cameos, the new weapons - damn they were cool, Kate McKinnon's fire dance and Chris Hemsworth.I really wish that the negative people giving these fake reviews would go out and see the movie, even if you go on ""Cheap Tuesday"" or whenever the tickets are cheapest. It will be worth it, just go in there knowing that this is a reboot of a movie made 32 years ago (by my count, we're almost up to three different lots of Spiderman movies in less time than that) and deserves to be watched with a fresh palette.

The horrid, horrid pacing and editing of this film fall on the director, not the performers. Batman v Superman was a theatrical cut that left you begging to see the director's cut.

I remember the original Ghostbusters. This reboot was not only respectful of the original film, but it was a fun, new take on the property. What was better than the original was the script, even giving a nod to the neckbeards winging on YouTube (must have been done during pick-up's which was a nice middle finger to haters). The story felt more organic, less forced.; and these characters were also a lot more charming than the original cast. In the original, Bill Murray was funny but came across less as a scientist and more of a con-artist. In the reboot, I could take the scientists more seriously.Then we get to the God of Thunder himself, Chris Hemsworth. I am convinced he was improving most of his performance, and it was comedy gold. Instead of the awkward Rick Morains nerd, we get the rather dimwitted Kevin (Hemsworth). He is delightful in the film, and he looks like he's having a ball making fun of himself.If you don't want to see the movie, don't. Hang on to the '84 original.

1734,celebrindae-587-507927,Go Have Some Fun: Your Questions Answered,9,17 July 2016,"This movie is a delight. Is it an instant classic? Will it still hold up in 30 years? Does it have the same kind of timeless comedy as the originals? Who cares. For right here, right now, the year 2016, it's a delight - and completely undeserving of the onslaught of bad reviews its getting online. The style is a little wacky, a little Parks & Rec, and it plays to some low-hanging feminism, but what comes together is a hell of a lot of fun. Plus, ghosts make a fantastic metaphor for women's issues (because no one believes in them). To answer some questions you may have before seeing this film: 1. Does the film hate men? Answer: No. This movie is mean to entitled terrorists and lying politicians, and that's about it. It's incredibly kind to Chis Hemsworth's character who is probably the most un-hateable man ever portrayed on screen. 2. Am I going feel attacked by this film? Answer: Maybe if you identified with the villain too much. In which case, you're probably feeling the same way I did when I identified with Voldemort. I get it, it's rough. Take a vacation and do some soul searching bro, you'll be fine. 3. How's the film do on diversity? Answer: Not great - it's the movie's weakest point. I'm really hoping Leslie Jones's character gets some more screen time in the next (because I'm sure there will be another) movie. I'd love to see the story focus more on her, but for what it was, her character is an integral part of the team, and it seems like Leslie had a lot of fun playing her. 4. Are there lesbians? Answer: There better be. I mean, I certainly think so, but I'd like to see them scream it from the rooftops next time. 5. Will Kate McKinnon turn me gay? Answer: If you're asking this, you're probably already there, but yes, she'll make it worse. Don't worry about compromising your bisexuality, though: Chris Hemsworth is right there to even it out. 6. Does Chris Hemsworth appear without a shirt? Answer: Yes, but that's not even the best part. 7. Isn't that proof that they're objectifying men in this film? Answer: Well, actually, they're making a statement about privilege, as well as building on tropes established by the objectification of women in film, so it makes for a well-developed critique of masculinity and gender roles, as well as sexism on a more meta level. Maybe you just don't get the joke.",Ghostbusters

However I went to watch it with an open mind hoping it would be good. Sadly for me the film just didn't work. Within just the first few minutes I found myself comparing this remake to the 1984 cult classic and wished I was watching it. The biggest let down for me were the characters, Holtzmann played by Kate McKinnon was unbelievably cringeworthy. Every time McKinnon went into one of her 'zany' rants you could feel the whole cinema breathe a sigh of relieve when she had finished. For me this remake was really trying too hard to be a comedy and really wasn't funny at all.

By that I mean there was literally a fart joke in the first 15 minutes and (SPOILER ALERT) they shot a giant ghost smashing the city in the dick. I think I may have enjoyed it a little bit if McCarthy and Wiig weren't in it. McCarthy played the same character she plays in EVERY MOVIE she's in. Wiig is just annoying and not funny, the other two were meh. The plot was terrible and it was obvious Papa Johns and Pringles got a cut. The worst part was the end when you find out it was just leading in to ANOTHER movie. The reason the first Ghostbusters was funny was because it was a somewhat serious movie with Bill Murray cracking jokes, this movie was literally everyone trying to be funny and none of them were. It wasn't just me, no one in the theater except a couple teen aged girls laughed, like no one.

1750,queenieasperger-701-991221,Surprisingly refreshing,8,21 July 2016,"I love the original Ghostbusters, so I entered the cinema half expecting a mediocre movie (at best). But, although the new Ghostbusters was far from perfect, I was pleasantly surprised. Not only is this new take on the sci-fi classic refreshing (mainly thanks to the four leading actresses, which do a pretty good job), but the 3D is great. Many of the ghosts and special effects surpass the letterbox bars and make for a very impressive ghost-hunting experience.The definite highlight of the film is, in my opinion, Kate McKinnon, whose character (Holtz) embodies the perfect combination of wit, slapstick humor, bad-ass moves and irreverence to make her instantly likable. This, however, does not overshadow the performance of Melissa McCarthy,Kristen Wiig and Leslie Jones, who are decidedly funny, each in their own style. I thought Chris Hemsworth's participation quite overdone, though. In his role as the dumb sexy secretary, he's portrayed exactly in the demeaning light historically assigned to women in the media. This was rather disappointing: the movie being starred by four women, I expected it to do away with this sort of stereotypes and not merely to reverse them. That's just me, anyway.Although it's a humorous movie, I have to admit I found some of its jokes rather exaggerated (as if the cast were trying too hard), but this happens in very specific scenes and in no way ruins the movie as a whole. So, all in all and despite its many flaws, it is a very entertaining film, action packed (especially at the end) and full of celebrity cameos.I simply don't get all the hate around it.There's a scene after credits, so you'll definitely want to stick around until the very end.",Ghostbusters

The actresses are definitely some of the best women to grace the big screen, and they proved that in this film. Kate McKinnon and Chris Hemsworth take the show, along with some familiar faces from our past. This reincarnation of Ghostbusters is a great way to bring the franchise to new audiences, such as our children. My wife and I prescreened the movie before letting the family join, and we will definitely be going a 2nd time in the coming weeks. If you are on the fence about going to this reboot, just think of the idea that Ghostbusters may not survive and continue on for future generations without this film. If you care at all about the movies that drove your childhood, don't suppress them, encourage them so we can have Ghostbusters for our children and their children, etc. This film is definitely up to par with the original franchise, and the throwbacks are all the more reason why this is fan candy.

What can I say? As a young woman growing up in a liberal environment, I am often disappointed at how the media often portrays women as two- dimensional and weak. ""At least,"" I thought, ""There will be some rad women kicking some ghost butt."" However, when the trailer came out and I saw Chris Hemsworth, I became worried. I figured that the movie would take the safe approach that would guarantee support from the masses of men: they would have the ladies do much of the work, but in the end, it would be the man saving the day.When I saw the movie today, I was pleasantly surprised. Not only were all four women extremely three-dimensional, with wildly different personalities and lifestyles, but the movie used the stereotypical model of a ""pretty and dumb female secretary"" and turned it around on men (Chris Hemsworth's character).Now, of course, many men are not happy about that and many other parts of the film. There were several jokes about men and defeating the ""boss ghost"" involved shooting it in the crotch. But in a world of gratuitous strip scenes (Alice in ""Star Trek Into Darkness""), only wanting women after they've been ""beautified"" (Laney in ""She's All That""), woman constantly needing to be saved (I don't think I even need to give an example because so many come to mind but ""Transformers""), and myriad jokes at the expense of women (""Jurassic World"" comes to mind), I think it's okay for men to be the butt of the jokes this time.Having said that, I understand that many men do not hold the above stereotypes about women and I think that said men (or anyone tbh) would really enjoy the cleverness of this remake. My little brother totally loved the cameos of the original ghostbusters and the ""realllly cool guns and stuff"" (his words, not mine).This is just my opinion, but I found it inspiring and totally rad that the 4 women didn't need men to help them defeat the bad guys. Also I like how each of the women was totally different from the other 3, yet none of them mocked or ridiculed the others for their hair, clothes, body, sexuality etc etc etc. I can honestly say that I have not laughed as hard as I did in this movie for a very long time, and I will definitely be going to see it again in the future. This is a movie that will be having a whole new generation shouting WHO YOU GONNA CALL?!?!?!",Ghostbusters
1753,misszoecat-719-509883,"I was 99% sure I would hate this, but....",6,24 September 2016,"This is my first review. I got tired of so many people deciding they would hate this before it was even released and decided to write a review hoping to encourage the die-hard original fans (of which I am one) to open their minds a little.I saw the original in the cinema when I was 5, it's still one of my favourite films. I honestly thought I'd hate this remake, but watched it with an open mind. The original had atmosphere, actual scares and an excellent storyline. Sadly, this version didn't. It felt more like a light-hearted modern-day superhero movie, which isn't a bad thing, I enjoy those too. It made me laugh out loud more than a few times and was very entertaining. It did let itself down with the ghosts, the brightly coloured CGI didn't work for me (How could they do that to you Slimer!), although it did fit with the film. I wanted to see scary ghosts, but it just doesn't have that dark side like the original. The times they did try to be dark, just seemed forced and out of place.I thought they took the man-bashing a little too far. Feminism should be about equality, not superiority. Hemsworth's pretty but dumb receptionist character was very funny though and well played by him. Although some of the patronising comments towards him were unnecessary.I'm a woman, but I hated the idea of female ghostbusters. I just wanted the old gang back. To add insult to injury, I wasn't a fan of the actresses they cast at all. I'm glad I was wrong about that and I thought they played their roles really well and with good comic timing. Kate McKinnon in particular, hope to see more of her.Overall a funny and entertaining, light, superhero style film.",Ghostbusters
1754,jessica-niehaus,Loved the original but was pleasantly impressed by the reboot,9,18 July 2016,"As a huge fan of the original I was skeptical about this movie. The trailers didn't impress me but I figured I would go see it and expected to walk out disappointed. I'm very happy to report that I was pleasantly entertained through the whole movie. There was a powerful chemistry with the cast that really made it fun to watch and my husband and I laughed through the whole thing. Kevin (Chris Hemsworth) was hilarious. He added another funny and refreshing component to the movie with his aloof and air-headed innocence. It was a nice ""spin"" on gender reversal that actually worked for the film. It didn't feel forced. Through the entire film not once did I feel myself comparing to the originals, because the script felt new. I walked out of the film feeling really good and pumped about it and was almost embarrassed how I could of missed this gem of a summer flick due to all the negative hype. One thing, we did not see it in 3D as I don't think anything but animation films are worth the extra cost. It saved us a little bit of money and the images were fine in 2D. Again overall an excellent film that is recommended for old and new fans alike. Didn't think it was appropriate for very small children though (some jump-scare moments and lots of violence).",Ghostbusters

Kate McKinnon was my favorite - her crazy character was awesome.I was worried the movie would have some bad spots or slow spots, but it flowed well and kept me interested.A lot of the reviews were spouting that it was sexist towards men - so it's okay to have a dumb blonde woman in a role, but if it is a dumb blonde man then I guess it's a problem. I think Chris Hemsworth was great in his role and made it fun.Granted it is a remake, and I loved the original Ghostbuster movies, but to me it was its own movie.",Ghostbusters
1756,tooher383,I don't get the bad reviews I enjoyed the film,8,7 November 2016,I have never written a review before but I really felt this film deserved it after all the bad press I read about it. Its nearly 5 months since the film came out and I deliberately steered clear of watching because of the bad reviews it got. The all female leads were very good. Great jokes and references to the original film with the actors themselves popping up. The acting was very good from everyone and I loved how Chris Hemsworth was the dumb blonde. All in all a great film to relax and unwind to. I really enjoyed it and would watch it again. It had some great laugh out loud moments as well. I would recommend watching it if ya fancy a good comedy with four great comedians. I love Kate Mckinnon and she does a really great job in her first movie (i think it is anyway). If you like any of Melissa Mccarthy films then you will enjoy this film.,Ghostbusters
1757,Spnxer,Keep an open mind,7,15 July 2016,"I went to see this film with a complete open mind and i left the cinema pleased with what i had watched. I also went to see it for the originals making an appearance - which was amazing!The four main leads all did a good job, some of which wasn't their strongest performance but was still good acting. The two stands out were clearly Chris Hemsworth and Kate McKinnon, they stole the show.With this being a reboot all four leads were always going to be compared to the phenomenal cast of the original and in a way they should be as they try to clearly take certain personality aspects from their counterparts.The USER reviews this film has received, some of it has it's merit and can be justified but a lot of the hate is simply because it has four female leads which is very disturbing for this day and age.That aide i would highly recommend seeing this film, weather you're a fan of the originals or not.

Entertaining for adults but still appropriate for children. Kate Mckinnon's performance stands out but all four women are wonderful. The advertising for this film did not do it justice, in any respect (damnit, Sony.) I was completely blown away and have a new respect for Paul Feig. Despite the hoards of whining trolls trying to rain on its parade, we got a movie that balances the tone of the original with the comedy of a new decade, all without alienating a new audience. I'm looking forward to a new era of female led action. I for one, am pumped for the sequel. 10/10.",Ghostbusters
1760,emilsrp,Probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen,1,12 July 2016,"This is probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen, and trust me - I've seen a lot of bad movies.You probably saw an Adam Sandler movie once and thought it couldn't be worse. Well, guess what this is on a whole other level of unfunny.Keeping in mind that we're in 2016, the special effects were god- awful. If you have ever watched a sub-5.0 Sci-Fi TV-Show, this should give you a hint of what kind of special effects you should expect. I'd say the directors would probably have been better off hiring my 14 year old son, to do some CGI in Adobe After Effects for a few hundred bucks.The fact that the movie has all female main roles, is not a problem for me. But the fact that every man in this movie is portrayed as either an incompetent idiot or evil, while literally every female in the movie is portrayed as a hero made me want to walk out after the 20 minute mark.!!! SPOILER !!! The movie ends with Melissa McCarthy shooting a big ghost in the groin. This should tell you what kind of anti-male humor you should expect throughout this movie.The fact that any director in the world, would invest just 10 cents in this movie, makes me wonder whether they're in it for the money, or just want to turn their career into a suicidal defeat. I wouldn't even recommend you to watch this movie ironically. Only watch this movie if you have literally nothing else to do, and by this I mean you'd probably have more fun watching a newly painted wall drying.",Ghostbusters
1761,LillyDiamond,Absolutely amazing - nothing for misogynists,10,7 August 2016,"This was a great movie! I was really worried about it when I read all the reviews (though it was rather eye-opening when you look at the gender-setup of the votes). Aaaanyway... I wish I would have had this stuff when I was a young girl. Those ladies kicked ass! It was funny, easy, well-made, sexy but not in the lascivious way that needed shirts to fall off or being soaked, intelligent (I am a scientist... trust me) and, on top of all of that a great movie for girls seeing that they can be something else than just pretty arm candy. The only thing I was not happy with - why do all the white girls have Phd's and the only black character is a train conductor? I mean, come on! If you went all the way making an all-girl Ghostbuster team you could have ripped down another wall by making the black girl a scientist and someone else the blue-collar worker. Still, 10 out of 10 just so I can kick some guys in their nether regions for voting so badly. Because girls rule. Booyah!",Ghostbusters
1762,MarcuslovesDidyme,A Jocular Movie with an Inspiring Message for Girls all around the World,9,25 July 2016,"It's rather ironic that this movie is being criticised for being 'sexist' when other movies have done the exact same 'sexist' actions, but with men instead of women, isn't it? The only real male hero in the film is a hilariously stupid receptionist who was mostly hired because of his looks. How sexist towards men? If only us ladies could feel this pain. It's almost like we've dealt with this issue our entire lives with hundreds of movies and panned as a 'rabid feminist' when we try to speak up.What is being called a 'man-hating film' is actually a rather inspiring tale for young girls. Let me explain, as a young girl, you see lots of women on the screen, but they're never the heroes. And even if they are, they always get saved by men. Women are often there because they're attractive and Disney movies like Cinderella and Peter Pan suggest to you that women should do the housework. It's very difficult to grow up with ambitions to do something important when you're constantly surrounded by the 'damsel in distress who needs a man' cliché. It feels like you can't ever do anything important if you don't look 'sexy enough'. That does wonders for your self-esteem.This movie changes that; it's turned on its head. They may be damsels in distress, but they can handle it. Anyone who calls it 'man-hating' has missed the point. They're blatantly oblivious of the blatant obvious or they're just ignoring it to find a non-existent fault in the movie. Maybe the women have saved the day while the men were frozen, but that doesn't make it sexist. That is positive enforcement for young girls. I have spent my entire childhood feeling like I could never be as good as a boy, am I not allowed to have this triumph? I will spell it out for you: A WOMAN'S TRIUMPH DOES NOT EQUATE TO A MAN'S FAILURE.None of the women were sexualised needlessly like they are in so many women. The clothes are not tight-fitting or showing skin which would be completely impractical, but we can all ignore that for other movies, right? They sat and ate food normally. They weren't eating to be sexy and no 'fat jokes' (body-shaming which can be incredibly damaging for people with eating disorders)were made at their expense. It had women eating because they were hungry. I'm sad that this shocked me and it should say enough about the sexism in society.The women had incredible chemistry and were jocular; I didn't stop laughing the entire time. It had diversity and wasn't white-washed. Leslie Jones was particularly amazing in the movie and I had a literal nerd-freak-out every time she explained a historical anecdote. These women were intelligent, they knew what they were doing and what they were talking about. Another thing that I found shocking which is ridiculous. Why are women never portrayed as intelligent? We are.There was no shoe-horned romantic subplot which I will give a round of applause to. Not every movie needs romance, but almost every movie has it. I'd much rather see a developed platonic relationship than an undeveloped, ludicrous 'romance'. If characters need to kiss for us to understand they're in love then it's an undeveloped relationship.I particularly found the soundtrack amazing and the music did very well in building tension and setting the mood for a scene. The Fall Out Boy remake isn't for everyone, but if they had just rehashed the original, I'm sure the meninists would have added 'theif' to the negative stereotype for women.I'll admit, there were a few jokes that didn't quite hit the marker, but that comes with comedy. It's subjective. Just because you didn't find something funny, it doesn't mean it's universally unfunny.I didn't particularly feel like the villain's storyline was developed enough, but Neil Casey did it justice as the antagonist. The homages to the original were witty and very enjoyable. The balloon ghosts were very creative and served for an amusing sequence. As did the taxi-driver scene.The movie isn't perfect. Some of the editing is choppy and there are times where jokes weren't funny. I'm not going to call it an Oscar-worthy movie, but for what it primarily is, a comedy, I find it great.The social commentary is great. Anyone who's calling it sexist and man-hating has missed the entire point of the movie. The movie is a gender reversal and puts the men in the shoes of the women. You can see how women feel watching almost all movies. You get a taste in our battle against sexism. There was a subtle line involving a pen knife and every woman needing 'to be armed' which I loved. It's a subtle reference to rape culture and how as a woman, I have been taught how to not get raped from the age of 12 while Brock Turner has basically gone free for his crime. The movie isn't attack against men, it's a portrayal of how women are treated for men to relate to. If you don't want to take this chance, then don't, but I'd like to remind you that it's the twenty-first century. Women aren't useless and only for men's sexual or romantic desire. Take Elizabeth Garrett Anderson, for example. This movie isn't about proving that women are better than men, it's about proving that women are equal to men. This movie is for young girls who need this confidence, who need this nudge that they can do anything they want and their gender shouldn't hold them back. That's why I've given it a 9 out of 10, because, yes it has it's faults, but it is a magnificent message for young girls out there. If I ever have children, this will be one of the first movies they watch, regardless of gender.",Ghostbusters
1763,vwhite-801-272814,Comedy that kicks butt and traps ghosts,10,18 July 2016,"Ghostbusters 2016 is a fun adventure with great special effects, lots of actions, and some great acting and laughs from today's hot comedians. The writing is tight and the 3d effects actually exceed the screen space so the ghosts and action seems to come right at you. I loved the female main characters that act just like action heroes and don't talk about dates, but do value friendship, honesty, loyalty, science, protecting others, etc.We all need heroes, but the laughs keep rolling and Kate McKinnon rocks the mad scientist shtick as well as being a multi-dimensional character. Leslie Jones is the NYC insider who knows all the history of buildings and people, with a touch of realistic, non- scholarly, practical knowledge to help the researchers survive. Kristen Wiig and Melissa McCarthy provide the heart and brain. The eager scientists are so excited to have their pet theories proved right and then get to deal with actual frightening ghosts who want the freedom to revenge themselves on the living.Fun music, great ghost effects, great editing.

1765,joshuavhigh,This movie made me so sad...,1,1 October 2016,"Now, keep in mind that I'm going to try to make this as least- hostile as possible. But when a movie is this hypocritical, bigoted, and ignorant, there is nothing good that can be said about it. Except for the people who were literally bribed into writing positive reviews.1: This movie was stolen. Everything in this movie was stolen from the first two. All they did was literally take the first movie, and remove the action parts and the horror parts.2: The sexism. This movie is probably the most sexist movie since Doomsday Machine. They replaced the entire main cast with only women to appeal to the radical Feminists. When your ideology discriminates against who you can cast in a role, that is called Fascism, and it's not a good thing.3: The bland lobotomized token male. Pretty much the only main character who was a man was turned into a stereotype. He was useless, annoying, fake, had an IQ below sea-level, and was clearly trying to pretend to be Brad Pitt, but with none of the acting talent. He also only got hired because of his looks.4: The racism. The only black character was turned into a loud, annoying, street-smart stereotype.5: The CGI. It was terrible, and very cartoon-like. ""Daffy Duck: The Early Years""6: The acting. Not one single main character in the movie could act. Not one. It looked like a grade- school drama club.7: The ""comedy"". Every single joke fell flat. I didn't laugh once at anything they said. Many of the jokes were sexist, too. The trailer is a perfect summary of the movie. Every single joke was dumbed-down because Paul Feig has no respect for his audience.8: The entitlement. The cast and director have been throwing a hissy fit ever since people saw what garbage the first trailer was. They have been trying to claim that people who don't like the movie are sexists. No, no, no, no, and NO. People who think they are entitled to success because of their gender are sexist. The cast of this movie is sexist. The director of this movie is sexist. The people who hate this movie are NOT sexist.9: So boring. This movie didn't take any chances, and didn't expand the Ghostbusters universe in any way.10: The product placement. It was everywhere. There might not have been a single scene where they weren't advertising something in the background. It made me long for the days of Foodfight!In conclusion, nobody should every give their money to these lazy fatcats again. I for one am never buying another Sony product in my life.

It was funny and well acted, in a very SNL way. You could tell the actors had a blast making this film. I know a lot of men have panned this movie as man-hating, but it's not really. Yes, a lot of the jokes were made possible because the cast were women. Good thing a lot of the audience is also women. The villain, as I mentioned before, is a ""nice guy"" - he thinks that he deserves something just because he hasn't got what he wants from the world. The scene in the basement where Abby tells him that this doesn't make his special is quite telling. There was so much about this film that was aimed at a female audience and I loved it. I love science girls and history nerd girls, and dorky boy and awkward flirting and just pretty much everything about the soundtrack. I'm so glad there wasn't a ""romance"" in the story, that it was about friendship and looking out for each other. So good. So fun. Definitely will watch again.",Ghostbusters

Was the movie great no.....but now is not the 80s there just aren't writers writing serious comedies like they used to. For a comedy in this day and age I think it was an OK movie. I do hope they make another and maybe tone down the silliness a bit and try to be a bit more serious like the 80's GB. 2 parts that drastically needed changed was the extreme dumbness they used for the receptionist.....they could have made him dorky and stupid without being so unbelievable.

I haven't seen the old ones because, well I'm 18 and never watched them as a kid, so when trying to watch the first one last year I gave up after half of the movie because it wasn't funny. This one however- the characters were weird and lovable, there were characters you didn't like, the soundtrack was fantastic, and let's be honest, Holtzmann was just wonderful.

There were so many plot holes throughout the movie it is ridiculous a eight year couldn't even follow along. I am a female and I am all for women having better opportunities on the big screen, but this cast did not mesh well there was no chemistry between them at all. I really tried to stomach this movie but all the horrible jokes and failed punchlines made me gag. This movie was Sh!t storm from the opening credits this had all the potential in the world to be a awesome movie,but sadly it failed. My biggest disappointment other than the remaining original cast had bulls!t cameos(they deserve better than that) is the final incarnation of the villain which really pisses me off and as it should of any Tim Burton fan. His final form looks just like Oogie Boogie from Nightmare Before Christmas. This movie is absolute garbage. Paul Fieg you have ruined my childhood and three of my favorite movies you sir are an IDIOT! If you thought that this was great idea you are so wrong.

1774,andrewotoole79,"No its not the original, give it a chance",7,14 July 2016,"OK, so i feel compelled to write a review because all i am seeing is people bashing this movie for rebooting a classic (and what a classic) but most of all from an all female cast. I'll try to be as unbiased an honest as possible.Cast - I thought it was a great cast, I'm a big fan of Kirsten Wigg, I've never really liked Melissa McCarthy, although i had secretly enjoyed Identity Theft, the other two did their roles well. About the stereotypical black ""hell no's""? yes i thought it was a little over the top, but i felt Leslie Jones character brought much more to the team than Winston who ""was willing to believe anything as long as their was a paycheck"". Back to Melissa, i thought she was brilliant at delivering the technoblabble, although i'd like to see how many takes. Kate McKinnon's character had a real dangerous psycho edge which i liked, total opposite of the nerd which was Egon.Chris Hemsworth, really? His lines were embarrassing, was he meant to be a male bimbo? I don't think there are people that stupid to think they hear our of their eyes. Without spoiling anything, watch the credits and say to yourself, why was that cut from the movie???Overall, when the movie was very sciency, it was good, when science went out of the window, which it did for about 20 minutes, i felt the movie lost its way, and i think those 20 minutes is what most people are judging the movie on. The bad guy just wasn't good enough and that for me was the let down.How about the cameos, they weren't too bad, i don't think they were awkward and a nice nod to Harold Ramis who sadly passed away before this was made.I think when it comes out on blue ray, we might get to see a proper cut of the film, i really hope so.

1775,dancingcrowdesigns,pandering to MEEEEEE,10,28 July 2016,"so I think every movie is pandering to someone, and that someone is usually straight white dudes. If women like it, it is because they can identify with something they see on the screen - a character, a feeling, a scenario - and the same is probably true for other minorities who are not routinely cast in anything but crowd scenes, bit parts or supporting roles.This movie contained four (FOUR!!) women (three of them over 40! NOT smooth, untried infants) working as a team to find and stop ghosts. The city government had women in it (and it seemed like they were the real power). The first responders; cops, fire, ambulance workers, all had women in their ranks. The most visible males were the worst kind of dudes; the pretty but appallingly dumb, the one who thinks the world owes him love, kisses and power, and a handful of other stereotypes that women everywhere have encountered.The women were capable. Not one was required to teach any dude how to save the world, instead they shared their knowledge, pooled their resources, and saved the world themselves. And then agreed to keep it on the down low and let dudes take the credit for it. which sucked - they should have gotten a parade out of that, but yeah, that happens too.I thought it was hilarious that the arch villain was clearly a Mens Rights, Pick-up Artist, reddit reading, cellar dwelling dude, and that seems to be the demographic that are slamming this movie the hardest.The whole movie made me laugh out loud. It made my kids laugh out loud. It made my husband amused. It was not really aiming at him.I've been encouraging my friends to see it, because they are either squarely in this movie's demographic, or are enlightened enough that watching women save the world will not be intimidating for them.",Ghostbusters
1776,maxine-nic,BRILLIANT! - My favourite movie this year!,10,17 July 2016,"I've never seen the original, it's too old for me and the bits I saw were just not that good so I had no interest.But when I saw this new updated version with a full female cast I was so excited to give it a try and DAMN am I happy I did! It was an amazing film! I found it funny, so much so that during the Metal concert I was nearly peeing myself, I couldn't breath I was laughing so hard! I liked all the characters (especially Holtz) because none of them were supermodel or your typical Hollywood female who kicks ass easily but still ends up as the damsel in distress. They all got a nice build, a nice introduction. The story itself followed along nicely and was interesting enough that it kept me entertained and the climax, my god, the climax! It was beyond amazing! It was so exciting! I was so into that final fight, especially Holtz with her guns and my God it was just a really good film! I also found the villain to be a good one because he had a good back story but he also wasn't a pathetic whiny loser, not really, because in truth he was really smart, even outsmarting the girls for a bit, as well as independent. He didn't have hired help or muscle men. He did it all by himself, so I don't get the people complaining that all the men were all idiots. He certainly wasn't. I also found Chris's satire portrayal of a typical dumb secretary good. It was a little over the top but then it was meant to be. It was making fun of all the other characters who played the same role, so even that was good.All in all I give it 10 out of 10. I normally tear films apart (even those I love to bits) but I genuinely could not find a flaw in this film. To me, at least, it was perfect and I am really hoping for more.This film is perfect, especially if you have young girls interested in action and supernatural. This film will give young girls and women someone to look up to and something to look forward to. I highly recommend it, so much so that if you do go, give me a call and I'll come with you to see it again! I loved it THAT much! I swear it is not the disappointment people have labelled it to be.",Ghostbusters
1777,HBKliq,So so bad. :(,1,27 July 2016,"I had mixed feelings about seeing this, but swallowed by pride and said I would give it a shot, and not be biased. As a big sci-fi fan, who loved the originals, this film fell flat.The acting was OK, and I feel they gave it their best, but the problem lay with the plot, poor comedy, and blatant anti-men jokes and scenes. Stereotype characters, all in reverse of the original film. I'm not sure what the agenda of this movie was? Men are idiots, women rule the world? Queef jokes, and ultimately the final boss scene, they destroy him by shooting him in the crotch. Who are they marketing this film too?Save your money, and if you really want to see the real sequel to the original series, i suggest playing ""Ghostbusters The Game"" on Playstation or Xbox.",Ghostbusters
1778,Countryboy2014,Mixed feelings. Worth my ticket.,7,14 July 2016,"""Ghostbusters 2016"" - SPOILER FREE REVIEW: First off, I want to say I had mixed feelings going into this film. If anything here is considered a spoiler, then I want to warn you, just in case. But I gave it a shot so here goes... I want to say that I was a fan of the original 1984 Ghostbusters film starring Bill Murray and Dan Aykroyd. However, it didn't really care for its sequel. For a while, I hadn't seen either film, and had already thought that a third film was already made. I do want to point out that I new who the Ghostbusters were because of my awesome cousin, who knows who he is, but that's not the point. When I heard plans for a third film were in the works, I figured I would watch the films and see how it could be done. Sadly, we lost Harold Ramis before such a film could be made. However, we got a new solution that was pulled out of nowhere, an all female Ghostbusters crew. I understand that there was a lot of Flak for this decision, as there were other solutions that could have been made, but it's too late for that now, although it would have been neat to see the other outcomes in some fashion. But enough of that. I was very open to see as to what a female version of the group would be like. We ended up with a very different idea than what we had in mind. I want to say that this film had a lot of fun moments. It brought back some of the classic elements we all know, well the Ghostbusters fans know, to the modern age. Some shots were well lit and most of the CGI effects that were the title creatures in the film were blended well for most scenes. Kristen Wiig and Melissa McCarthy were rather enjoyable to watch, as I feel some of their previous roles, not including SNL, were unfavorable. I do want to say that I loved Chris Hemsworth's performance in this film. Although it's not anything magical, it is something worth seeing, as the way Chris Hemsworth portrays his character I feel is just too much for words, but I felt like I could laugh at anything he could have said that made sense in the instance of context. I want to say along with the more satisfying elements of the film, there were some nostalgic moments that were worth seeing. Some I wish had been shown a little longer, but hey, at least they made it in some form or fashion. Many familiar faces and places, but I won't say what they are. I do have some complaints though. There were some minor continuity errors that I caught, I will not say, but the average audience member wouldn't catch them right off the bat. Some repetitiveness with some score that I wish had only been used for more ""inspiring moments"" in the film. I want to also point out I didn't laugh as much as I wanted to. I supposed it may have been the execution of the jokes. I did;t really care for Kate McKinnon's character for the majority of the film, although she gets a little more tolerable in the later parts of the story. I don't have many words for Leslie Jones, my feelings for her character are half and half; as I feel that she wasn't really needed for this film, but I can let that slide for the most part. The villain seemed to be forgettable, but did have some interesting plot points. My main complaint is the first half of the film. It felt a little fast for what I knew it could have been. The first half of the film had little character development but that character development pays off somewhat and could possibly be expanded upon in a future title, granted if this film makes as much as the studio hopes. Anyway, the first half of the film felt somewhat out of place for the classic style we're used to, but the second half makes it all mostly better and worth the ticket I paid for. I do also want to point out that this film is a little harder for me to rate, as I have mixed feelings about the film. I may not be saying everything that I want to say, but I can certainly say that my good/bad scale is at an even 50/50. And last, I want to say that this film isn't as bad as the internet wants the film to be. Yes, the first half of the film is a bit unfavorable, but it's equally as enjoyable as a whole. Not many folks will agree with my positive notes, but hey, to each is their own. I enjoyed this film for what it was, a mostly enjoyable summer flick with mixes of action, supernatural themes, and nostalgia mixed with a modern twist. MY RATING: 6.7-7.2 Stars",Ghostbusters
1779,jamieieie,"Great writing, smart one-liners galore, talented comedic ensemble cast. Loved it.",7,16 July 2016,"I watched this in a sold out theater with an audience that laughed their asses off (as did I and my boyfriend) and clapped at the end. The snappy one-liners just kept coming, and the retelling of the backstory was handled pretty deftly. I also loved the unexpected bit of social commentary that came along with the main villain (a subtle response to the rationale often used by mass shooting perpetrators in the U.S.) Great cameos by most of the original 1984 cast, too. I grew up in the 80s and loved Ghostbusters, but I can honestly say I loved this new version more. I have a feeling I'll be buying this one to watch over and over.",Ghostbusters
1780,mario-hey,Worst Ghostbusters Movie ever!,2,21 February 2019,"This movie version is just plain garbage!
There is just no other way to describe it. And the only reason i dared watching it, was because I could watch it on Netflix.It is not Funny, the cast is the worst of the worst (thoug I do love female casts for main roles, but not in this case) especially since they try to act like males and not only that, cause they try to copy the original.
It just doesn't work!Actually the only thing that kept me watching was the special effects (the reason I gave two stars). They were spot on.
But what it comes down to in the end, is that it just isn't worth to go into my movie collection, or to be rewatched at all!It would be way cooler to have the original cast (the still living ones) to do another one. In their age this could be way more interessting then a bunch of no names trying to be good actors!",Ghostbusters
1781,jdezenzio,"Awful, absolutely awful!",1,20 February 2017,"Against all reasoning I decided to watch the full movie remake. Where can I begin. First, Leslie Jones (while sometimes funny on SNL) should hang up her acting career and stick to stand-up. She was horrible! I thought I was watching a female Richard Pryor on steroids. Kate McKinnon must have gone to the same acting class as Leslie. The only female deserving of being on the movie at all was Melisa McCarthy because she at least can hold up the others in the cast.They should have cut the remainder of the movie 15 minutes in and replaced it with old Godzilla footage. Maybe have Melissa McCarthy stomping on toy trucks and cars.",Ghostbusters
1782,zoebracegirdle,"Loved the original, but loved this more!",10,21 August 2016,"This movie does not deserve the hate it is getting. It has four hilarious women at the center who make great role models for the younger audience whilst also making for an exceptionally fun experience. It was so refreshing to watch a film that didn't have any unnecessary romantic subplots involving the female characters (albeit the occasional flirting between Erin and Kevin). Don't hate on the film before you have seen it because you don't like the cast. Yes it is different from the original, it's thirty-two years on. If you liked Paul Feig's other movies 'Bridesmaids' and 'The Heat', you'll love 'Ghostbusters'. Hoping for a sequel!",Ghostbusters
1783,zero_orion_82,It's every bit as bad as you think it is.,1,25 July 2016,"I'm gonna start this off by saying that if you're a fan of the original Ghostbusters, you really aren't going to want to see this movie. There. Now that rules out almost anyone who'd really wanna go see this movie. But if you're still here, know this. I grew up loving the franchise as a kid. I watched the first two at a young age (young enough to have the first movie actually scare me the first time I saw it), watched The Real Ghostbusters (and Ghostbusters {the one with the two guys and the gorilla}) religiously on TV, and I always wanted to dress up as a Ghostbuster. Hell, I even watched Extreme Ghostbusters in the 90's, and they could've plagiarized that and gotten a worthy sequel.But this Ghostbusters movie is everything the trailer promised it'd be. A half-arsed rehash of everything from the first movie with far less inspiration or respect for the source material. Also too many jokes. In horror movies, you can't always focus on the scares or people will just come to expect it and the scares will fall flat. With comedies, it's the jokes. You have to try not to be funny sometimes. Given, this movie succeeds in that department, but for all the wrong reasons. This movie has so many ""jokes,"" I spent the whole two hours asking ""Can you stop? You made me laugh a few times, just...just quit while you're ahead."" Yes, this movie will make you laugh a few times, but by the end of it, you're just going to be begging it to stop.As many people have stated, the CGI is bad, too. The ghosts look more cartoon-y than they did in The Real Ghostbusters. And Chris Hemsworth's character, their new secretary was just ridiculous. His character was stupid and egotistical as ****, and I'm not sure if the writers/director wrote him that way because they hate men, or just wanted him to be the fan service character. He held up pictures of himself shirtless, and they felt it was so important, they had to show 'em again in the end credits sequence. They ruined the movie's best character by making her constantly fawn over him to levels so creepy, she was getting to be scarier than the ghosts...though that's not really saying much for this movie. The whole coffee scene, though. Come on.The villain's as uninspired as everything else is in this movie. They didn't try to make him interesting or threatening. He's literally just there to fill a role. Like everybody else in this frigging' movie. This one was directed by a guy who only makes parodies, and it shows. There was actually zero respect for the source material. If this movie was developed and marketed as a parody with the title ""Ghosthunters,"" or something, I'd be like ""Great, they made a parody. At least they didn't make it an official movie in the franchise,"" but they did. They hired a guy who only makes parodies and put him in charge of a main title. The good news is, they're getting the original director in for the sequel. If you haven't seen this movie yet, don't waste your time or money. The sequel's guaranteed, so there's no reason to watch this movie, even if you wanted to support the series as a whole, and want to see newer, better ones. At least you can take comfort in knowing the next one will be better.And for everyone who's been too afraid to criticize this movie because of fear of allegations of sexism, sometimes a cigar is just a cigar. Sometimes a bad movie's just a bad movie. Stop being cowards and just call it what it is. Just because the director and Sony Pictures has been screaming ""You're just sexist!"" (and sure, some internet trolls said things to that are blatantly sexist, but welcome to the internet) at everybody who's had any constructive criticism for this movie doesn't mean you should let them. They're the cowards for not being able to handle the criticism. If you can't handle criticism, don't make a movie.",Ghostbusters
1784,xxtrollerxx09,Try Hard to appeal to everyone,4,11 July 2016,"This movie is flawed and utterly biased towards sexism. And example of one the flaws is that they describe the proton packs on this movie (and the previous) as a weapon made to contain ghosts, so they can be trapped. So, in no shape or form, it has the ability to kill them. As you can see, they throw that canon piece of logic out the window as soon as you get to the ""big fight scene"". That utterly looks like four people fighting with a green screen behind them.And biased. All male characters are depicted as inept, dumb, aggressive and very poor at their jobs. Every single one of them. Sure, you can sprinkle it here and there for comedic effect, but that was not the director choice on this movie. It makes it look like a man bashing film, because it ""kinda"" is. The only exception they made was the villain, and even so... let's just say he's not the sharpest tool in the shed. It is so man hating, the final scene, who was already spoiled on the trailers, so no spoiler warning here, the way they defeat him is a proton pack to the crotch. Yeh, let's talk about emasculating moves.About the characters. They are four fine actresses, and I love their work on previous gigs (SNL, for instance). So much so, the movie itself almost looks like a hour long skit. They didn't mesh well, and it showed, time and time again. Maybe because they were made so cartooney, all suspension or disbelief of reality were just impossible to reach. I have to point out the work of Leslie Jones, tho. She played the role of the token black women, and all they said to her was ""be the loud, in your face, cliché, over the top black woman you can be""... and she delivered. Is that funny? For the first 30 seconds. After that? No. And the ""male Janine"". Yep, Thor. That was introduced as eye candy for women. And they empathize that. He was hilarious, almost the saving grace of this movie. But, if the roles were reversed, feminists would cry foul, and they'd be right. That's your logic right there. Regardless, we always knew Chris Hemsworth was capable of a comedic role in his bag of tricks, he just proved he was capable of that with a very poor written script.The cameos were also almost the saving grace of the movie... until you realize they were there to pull the heart strings of fans to go see it. But, the way they were written in, they could have been done by anyone else. It's almost like the ex you were terribly in love with, wanted to spend the rest of your life with, but things ended, and badly. And now you fail to acknowledge them when you walk pass them on the street. Yeh, a smile, a nod, two or three words, but nothing to remember in the end of the day.But i'll give 5 stars on this movie on one aspect. The cringe factor. I wont say details, I'll save the surprise for when you see it (or don't see it), but they went the extra mile by not going the mile, so the cringe is there, and it's real.I could really go on and nitpick on everything that is wrong on this movie, on screen, and out of it. The list, sadly, is long, and the reasons are well based. It's a shame what the movie is and ended up as being, and for the longest time I hoped that all the bad publicity they were festering were just a publicity stunt. You know, a big joke and the punchline was actually a watchable, fun, blockbuster movie. What they presented... was a ghost shaped turd with a bow.",Ghostbusters

Shame shame on the people who wrote bad reviews!! This movie was so good!!! Please give this movie a chance. I promise you, you will not be disappointed. I laughed out loud so many times. Many of the movie goers in my audience were laughing and clapping. So to me that sounds like a great movie not a badly written one.",Ghostbusters
1786,nicholasbrown-85,"This movie is good, don't listen to the trolls!",8,18 July 2016,"Ghostbusters review: a strong 8 out of 10. Here's why: The plot is original and it in no way makes an attempt to recreate the originals in any way. That said, they attempted (and succeeded) in paying respect to the originals, including using the original theme more than the cover by Fall Out Boy (wise move). Also, every living main cast member (aside from Rick Moranis) made cameos in this movie, and a bust of Harold Ramis can be seen early on in the movie. Could it have been funnier? Sure, in quite a few places. But, overall, if this movie tanks it's not because it's a bad movie, but because of people listening to Internet trolls who say this is a bad movie without seeing it themselves. Which brings me to my next point: unless I've completely missed out on the whole ""seeing movies before they've released"" memo, most of these bad reviews for this movie were written prior to the release. I get that a lot of people are allowed to see some movies before they're released, but you can't tell me that all of these negative reviews are based simply on some of these people being trolls for the sake of being trolls. This is NOT a bad movie, and is NOT insulting to the originals. I love the originals, but let's not forget how ludicrous the plot for GB:2 was, or forget we're talking about a movie where people trap ghosts for a living. It's meant to be silly, good fun. See the movie, or don't; but don't write negative reviews just because you saw the trailer and thought this was going to suck. The trailer, uncharacteristically, doesn't give away any plot points or show the best moments from this movie. In short, take the advice of Wil Wheaton and ""don't be a d**k"". If you enjoyed the originals, you will enjoy this movie, plain and simple. Plus, I think it speaks volumes that every main cast member makes an appearance. I get that they are actors who get paid to do this work, but not every ""remake/reboot"" has been able to get the original cast members back (Dukes of Hazzard movie anyone?). I think this says a lot about their endorsement. Lastly, stay through the credits for a set up for the sequel, which is well deserved in my opinion.",Ghostbusters
1787,altuga-950-978958,Not that bad. Actually entertaining.,7,16 July 2017,"First of all I love original Ghostbusters. I have DVD's, Ecto One car and Peter Wenkman figure. And honestly despite the love of those films I have, They are very goofy and cult level movies at the same time.They are not Oscar movies.But they have class. The new one is not a great movie. But an entertaining one .I laughed a few times and wondered whats gonna happen next scene. Which is not every movie pull it off these days. Yes there is overacting. But there is a lot of new thing bring this movie for franchise. Fight scenes are much more intense. Villain is actually understandable. And he has a logical (in movie standards) plan and motivation.He is a nobody and he wants be a somebody.Simple but so most people are. Maybe a little backstory give him more character. Cameos are some them OK some of them unnecessary. Don't get me wrong. This film has flaws and plot holes. Overall, this is not a bad movie. It's a enjoyable popcorn flick.

The amount of hate this thing has gotten was (and still is) ridiculous, but I wasn't super impressed by the trailers to try and defend it. So I didn't really know what to expect when I went in, but I had a really fun time with this movie. It's not better than the original, but miles better than the '89 sequel (a lot of people seem to conveniently forget how awful that movie was when they tear this one down.) Interested to see this franchise move forward and how they can deviate from the original franchise.I'd really rate this a 7/10, but I gave it a 9 to try and balance out the unnecessary 1s and 2s this is getting from people that probably haven't even seen it.",Ghostbusters

An enjoyable romp. I could point out many of the little flaws, but in a film like this, it really wouldn't make a difference. Editing was a little choppy and amateurish. CGI was pretty distracting. Felt a bit rushed. I wouldn't see it again, but I enjoyed it while I was there. If there's anything this film made me wanna do is call the original Ghostbusters.

1796,carlbpickles,Nowhere near as bad as some reviewers seem to think it was,7,3 December 2016,"I'm a pretty big fan of Ghostbusters. I've seen the original film quite a few times. I've also seen the sequel several times. I watched The Real Ghostbusters cartoon series, and I've even read some of the comics. My wife is a HUGE fan of the original film. Our six year old son loves The Real Ghostbusters.Based on that first trailer, neither myself nor my wife had any interest in seeing this film. At all.This evening, we rented it on Amazon Prime, quite prepared to turn it off part way through.You know what, though? We got to the end. The little guy LOVED it. I was genuinely surprised how much I enjoyed it. It was also surprisingly easy to fit it into original Ghostbusters continuity, based on Dan Aykroyd's cameo and something the mayor says part way through about people forgetting.OK, Erin (Kristen Wiig's character) simpering over Thor was a bit of a sour note... to be honest, Wiig's character in her entirety was a bit... wet. But then again, I forget. Women aren't allowed to be intelligent, strong-willed and assertive in Hollywood films unless they are either the villain or about to die.As a popcorn movie, this one hit all the right marks. Plenty of spectacle, an engaging cast (most scenes stolen by Leslie Jones and/or Kate McKinnon) and a the fact it wasn't a shot-for-shot remake.The Rotten Tomatoes score of 72% is probably about right.

I was looking forward to watching the talented cast in this movie but their talents were wasted throughout the entire movie and Melissa McCarthy even had a hard time pronouncing all the scientific buzz words.

But the men in media could be dynamic and heroic or anything else that they could dream to be. It is so important to have female roles that do not just exist to be support or eye candy. Each of the women in this movie is dynamic and funny and smart and it's so important to have that! I'm sorry but this movie exists for girls who dream to see themselves as powerful and smart and funny for themselves and not just to impress a guy. This movie is for little girls who haven't yet been told that science is just for boys. Girls who can be flawed but still succeed, they don't have to ""have it all!"" (because that's impossible and movies that say that you can are lying to you). Men have had media telling them that they are strong and successful all their lives and now it is time for women to have those kinds of role models as well. Plus! The movie was actually really funny and the effects were great. As someone who studies production design, I am so happy to see a ghost movie out there that doesn't try too hard to be dark or gritty for the hell of it. The colors are great and the story is also great. It pays homage to the originals while standing strongly on its own. Leslie Jones is helping to pave the way for POC comedians playing roles where they are smart and important to the cast, not just a cast off character who takes the brunt of the jokes. She is important and wonderful. TL;DRThis movie is actually pretty awesome despite all the whiny dudebros who are mad that ""the feminists are taking over"" (I say it's due payback for the gross old men who took my little pony away from little girls)And also representation is important and women are great and girls can be scientists and don't just have to exist as a hot secretary (now we have Chris hemsworth to do that!)",Ghostbusters

1803,quinloki,Hilariously awkward and awesome,10,16 July 2016,"I'm not a fan of awkward comedies. I HATE most romcoms because of stupid miscommunication being the only thing that seems to launch the story forward. There's an awkward factor in Ghostbusters, but it works so well as to be enjoyable. The special effects are solid too, and crisp even in faster paced 3D shots. There's a teasing of some 4th wall breaking that is just so well timed and you can see the synergy and chemistry between the cast. I'm terrified of crowds, and often avoid a trip to the movie theater unless I just feel like I need to go. I'm glad I braved the crowds, and I plan to do so again - this movie was AMAZING and a part of me is sad to see it getting panned by a lot of folks.It doesn't replace the original, and it's not less just because of some gender-bending, but it's damned entertaining, and visually appealing. I recommend it in 3D if you can watch it that way, but I'm going to see it a second time in 2D so I'll either update this review or reply to it afterward.",Ghostbusters

An American comedy that not only has a stellar cast of SNL alumnae but attached is Paul Feig who understands the potential of women on screen. No love interest except a reversal of sexy secretary these intelligent women bust ghosts using awesome weapons hearkening back to the original. There is slime, ghosts and laughs. It makes for an enjoyable night and although some have unfairly criticised the movie and canon of female friendly films encroaching on a male dominated area of film they can jog on.

However, being a fan of the originals I had to give it a go, and it's great! It has all the clever yet accessible wit of the original movies, but has it's own modern style (and plenty of Easter eggs for Ghostbuster fans to enjoy). Despite all the controversy over the cast I thought they did an amazing job, the characters were well written and actors all portrayed their parts perfectly. The CG animation was great, as you would expect from any movie in 2016, and the plot was well developed - It had clear parallels to the original movie, but was different enough that you didn't know what to expect and, unlike the original, it explained why the ghosts appear more and more frequently throughout the movie. If you loved the original Ghostbusters, or just funny Sci-Fi movies in general, I highly recommend this movie.",Ghostbusters

However, it has its moments. All of the original, living, Ghostbusters make cameo appearances as well as Annie Potts (Janine) and Sigourney Weaver (Dana Barrett). At the end of the day, the plot is not that much different from the others. How else can you? A person/thing decides to try and take over New York City using ghosts. Also, the ghosts are much different looking in this reboot, much more cartoo- nish. I think the movie plot could have been a lot better with the Original Ghostbusters passing the reigns down to a female crew. With at the end of the movie, them helping the new female Ghostbusters defeat the villain. Could it have been better, most certainly. Could it have been a lot worse, DEFINITELY.",Ghostbusters

You did not ruin my childhood and in the process, made a great film, I have had time to process and am ready to post. This weekend I attended the red carpet premier of Ghostbusters. My impressions are below.The movie delivered for me and I really enjoyed it. It was not a rip off of the original as the characters had their own development and style. They were busting ghosts but with a different purpose and with a distinct protagonist that is different from the original with a different purpose. It worked well. The first 10 min were the only tough point for me but only because the movie had to start and find its stride. I saw it in 3D and it really was awesome. The 3D was not just an afterthought. It really added to the film and made me feel a part of it. The audience I was with were all hardcore ghost heads and fellow busters. The mood during and after the showing was positive and energized. I heard lots of laughter and support. None of the people I talked to or were there with booed or had a negative reaction. Most can't wait to see it again. My biggest complaint is that I have to wait until Thursday to see it again. Great time was had by all! Finally, some will hate no matter what. I went to this film expecting to be let down. (Sorry Paul) I was in fact pleasantly surprised. I loved the film. I can not say it enough. If you honestly give it a chance, you will enjoy it. I know this film will grow a next generation of busters!",Ghostbusters
1810,ntheanswer,Nothing at all like the original,2,27 February 2019,"There are very few movies that I stop watching out of disgust. But this is one of the very few...3 times in fact. The Comedy in this movie is fart jokes. FART jokes. Are you kidding me?? I waited 27 years ....They wrote this movie for idiots.The original film was a horror with comedic elements throughout, not scraping for a laugh every minute of the film! It had a serious tone and was scary with a brilliant score. This was written for a new generation that doesn't have an appreciation or attention span for well written adult comedy requiring an IQ above 10.Shame on the writers of this film for not trying harder to remain faithful to the comedic sensibilities of the original. I'm sure you were trying to please a younger modern audience, but I don't care. So thoroughly dissatisfied with this sole stain on an otherwise excellent franchise.I hate this film. I'm only giving it a two because I'm clearly biased by my feelings about the original and so maybe I'm being a bit harsh.",Ghostbusters
1811,hakker9,"Visually nice, but too forced attempts at humor",4,20 February 2017,Story wise the movie is pretty good and visually very nice however the point what just destroys the movie is the fact that Paul tried to make every character funny. So what we get in the end are very 2 dimensional characters along with tons of one-liners in an attempt to let them all be funny which he just failed. Aside for 3-4 decent parts of humor it just is an endless endeavour of running against a brick wall and just overflows the whole thing whats underneath and that is just a good movie.Seriously what the hell was Paul Feig thinking when trying to throw in so many one-liners and *kuch* funny situations *kuch* (yes it's sarcasm). We can see he watched the original ones but apparently he didn't grasp the concept why it was working.Really if the movie had maybe 25% of those so called funny situations/one-liners and those were done right the movie would have gone to a 7-8 easily. Now it's ends up as a horrible failed attempt and ruining what could have been something good.,Ghostbusters

And what surprised me was that a lot of the reviewers hadn't even seen the movie. I feel if you are going to rate a movie you should hold judgment until you actually watch the movie. With that being said, I thought the movie was great. It was funny and had good animation. Yah, some of the acting was a little silly, but it was still good and it fit into the movie. Have you seen the acting int he originals? Talk about cheesy and I am a huge fan of the originals. It was not a retelling of the original (I saw in another review, saying it was a rip-off of the original - did they even watch the movie like they claim?). It has nods to the original movies, but with a story line of its own. It was very women empowering with a few jabs at men, which was funny and refreshing.

The all-female crew does not detract from anything. What's most important here is: does the film make you laugh? Yes, it did. Many times. Second-most important thing: does it live up to the promise of the premise? ""What if all the GB were women? What would happen that's specific to THAT set-up?"" And they fulfill that beautifully. Particularly when they go up against the Big Bad. Essentially, the film-makers kept the same structure of the original film, repopulated it.

Don't make the mistake of missing one of the funniest movies in recent history because there's a vocal substrata of nostalgia Nazis who refuse to view this film on its own merits.The truth is this movie draws you in with obvious chemistry between the characters, who are played by four of the most gifted comedians in show biz and who deliver on a solid script that offers some clever nods to the original. We laughed and laughed. And let's be honest. Although Ghostbusters 1984 is one of the most beloved films of all time, it's single most endearing quality is Bill Murray's deadpan comedic style.

I'll admit I had reservations but thought it could be interesting.That all went down the drain when I heard how Sony's Amy Pascal and Feig were bullying the old cast and driving false ideology into the film, still, I thought the cast seems good, Kate's a pretty funny girl.I saw it earlier today and left pretty depressed, I can't believe Feig took some of the funnier women in the business and pulled them down. The movie just... wasn't... funny! At all!The effects, people have been harsh since the first trailer, whilst they are by no means bad, there aren't good either, like a mid- 2000's TV show.The cameos are also forced and feel really out of place, Bill visibly doesn't want to be there and most of the other men in the film are portrayed as idiots bar Chris's character.The story is a mild rehash of the original and it doesn't help itself that it somehow makes the story awful. I won't spoil it but the ending is complete and utter garbage, showing the world that Kevin Feig and Amy Pasal are nothing but colossal sexists.I'll be flying back to the states tomorrow after spending some... Quality family time, watching this train wreck unfold on the big screen. You can be damn sure I'll let people know just how bad this was.

It was if they threw a bunch of strangers together and none of them cared about the others. As a result I didn't care about any of them. Playfulness among the characters seemed fake and forced as did any excitement they showed. Seemed like they mostly were thinking ""What am I doing in this movie and how much longer do I have to endure this?""Pointless cameos added nothing to its entertainment value (except perhaps the giant ghost that unintentionally looked like John Goodman).Those under 25 that have never seen the original may find this more entertaining than I did.Might have given it two stars if I had seen it free on TV.",Ghostbusters

1820,xixris,One of the best reboots in a while,10,16 July 2016,"I've just gotten home after watching this film and I'm fairly certain I haven't been this excited after watching a movie in a while.I grew up watching the Ghostbusters when I was a kid. I've seen the movies more times than I'd like to admit. Probably know more about them than I should and more than a casual viewer would. When I found out they were making a reboot of the films, I was a little nervous. On the upside, there was going to be an all female cast, giving much needed representation to the barren wasteland that is women in Hollywood, but these movies were dear to me and it is rare when a reboot lives up to the original. I was understandably skeptical. What if it wasn't good enough? Let me put your mind at ease. It was better than anything I could have asked for. These days remakes of old film franchises are a dime a dozen but it is really rare when a reboot so perfect captures what the original was. The new Ghostbusters absolutely delivers in that regard. It was humorous, a little cheesy, and full of little cameos/easter eggs that nodded to the original first movie.The cast was great! In terms of decent female representation, I was a starving women and this movie was a perfectly crafted feast that I couldn't get enough of. The main characters all fit well together and seemed to have a lot of chemistry between them. There was no shoe-horned romantic subplot, no sexualization of any of the characters, and holy cow, let me tell you about that great body diversity between our four leading ladies. This alone could have been enough for me, but it gets better.Campy effects and a style that is based wholly around the original had me absolutely in love. The the 80's aesthetic gadgets that were all flashing lights and overly pretty for the sake of it warmed my heart. The CGI wasn't /meant/ to be believable. It was based entirely around giving a modern update to the Ghostbusters style. Which does /not/ include realism at all. This isn't the Dark Knight. It's not Lord of the Rings. It's not serious. None of these movies have /ever/ been serious.I think that when it comes to modern film there is a high demand for realistic completely logical stories to the point that we've forgotten how to just have fun. The new Ghostbusters is a breath of fresh air that I welcome. Not everything has to make me cry. Not every movie has to be some epic drama. This movie made me grin and laugh and on the way home my friend and I couldn't shut up about all of the things we loved about it. I fully intend to see it again while it's still in theaters. Heck, I wanted to see it again the minute the credits started to roll.It seems to me that a lot of the negative reviews are from people expecting this to be something other than what Ghostbusters has ever been.

1825,drapehsd,Hollywood finally got it right for women,10,20 July 2016,"""Safety lights are for dudes."" - Dr. Jillian Holtzman This is my new favorite movie of all time. IMHO, this is a movie that EVERY woman should go see in the theater. Multiple times. Just to let Hollywood know that THIS is the portrayal of women that we want! It's hilarious, but never once makes a PMS joke or does anything that disparages women. They make gentle fun of themselves, at times, but there's no ""punching down"" in this movie. No cattiness or mean- spiritedness. There's plenty of eye candy, no matter your preference (Chris Hemsworth and Kate McKinnon are both adorable), but not a single romantic subplot to be seen. In fact, we're not even sure about the sexuality of most of the characters, whether they're gay / straight / bi / other, because it (gasp!) DOESN'T MATTER to the plot. (A refreshing change from the creepy stalker vibe of the original movie.) Yes, ladies, Hollywood actually made a movie that doesn't assume we're all trying to catch a man, doesn't assume that we're miserable if we're single, doesn't require smart women to also be sexy and fashionable in order to be taken seriously, and DOES assume that women are just as capable at doing any job as any man. All the heroes were funny women OVER AGE 30 (gasp!), where the emphasis is on their talents and not sexualizing their bodies. Depicts four extremely intelligent, well-educated and well-read women who successfully go into business for themselves after being dismissed by the male hierarchy. No one was ""in charge"" or ""the hero"" or ""the lead."" They all worked together as a team, each smoothly saving the others' lives multiple times. ALL of them were kickass heroes together, and none of them were competitive or tore each other down. Even though two of them were women of size, there was not a single mention of this, and not a single fat joke. All four women were portrayed as brave, strong, and competent in their fight scenes, regardless of body type. (I'm already planning how I'm going to build proton packs for my little niece and nephew. What smart, brave, kickass role models for them!) Humor for all tastes, everything from fart jokes to slapstick to intellectual puns.

It started out good enough with some jokes from the robotic personality guy from the Silicon Valley show, but my god! It does not work with females. Not being sexist here and I enjoyed Bridesmaids enough. It's a combo of the cast and script but it's not a ""Ghostbusters"" type movie. This is different in a horrible way with the same name.

1827,seanzeutm,Enjoyable Reboot,10,20 July 2016,"One must view a movie as a piece of art on it's own individual merit. Smart movie, dumb movie, long movie, short movies, doesn't matter. It is what it is. It's art. If you find yourself discussing where that line is, where art stops being art or not, then you're thinking way too much. Some movies call for discussion, some don't. I digress.Before the movie came out, Internet and real life flesh-and-blood people, some friends, all dudes, where completely offended by the idea that they are making a Ghostbusters movie with an all female cast. Now, if this single fact alone creates such a volatile reaction, I think the discussion of sexism is a relevant one. This discussion can be complex and nuanced and doesn't have to begin or end with anyone being called a woman hater. When men have had so much political and corporate power for hundreds of years, and just over one-hundred in the cinema, it's understandable to have this knee jerk reaction. But it doesn't mean we, as men, can't figure this emotion out, understand why it's okay to have an all female cast and, not only enjoy this movie more, but maybe enjoy life a little more too. To continue. The trailer turned out to be the 3rd most hated video on YouTube. To begin, I thought the first trailer was promising: A few good laughs and snippets of adventure that looked like fun. Was it the best trailer I've ever seen. No. But, I can honestly say lots of good movies have mediocre trailers. If every mediocre trailer was voted 3rd most hated YouTube video, then the the 3rd most hated video on YouTube would always be a movie trailer. And in addition: most of the complaints about the movie derived from the trailer that I have heard end up being false, and naturally, because one hadn't seen the movie yet, misinformed. There's a real lesson to be learned here: don't be angry at something you're guessing is true. On to the fans. I'm a fan of the 1984 Ghostbuster movie. No reboot, recast etc. is going to take the 1984 Ghostbuster movie away from you. It's yours. It's as a simple as that, right? I saw the reboot twice. Both times the theater was full and the laughter was uproarious. That was my experience with the audience.If you're resistant to this movie, the first thing to acknowledge going in, is that it is a different movie than the first two. The team of filmmakers aren't trying to replicate the same tone or sense of humor. It's a Paul Feig movie and it feels like one. Now, comedy is tricky-- it's far more nuanced and particular to an individual than a drama. But, I'd make the leap to say if you laughed with Feigs previous films you'll laugh with this one. This one is pretty neck and neck with Spy for me (2015) as my favorite Paul Feig film. I hope that gives you a sense of what you'll most likely get in the laughs department. The action/adventure scene are pretty light and fun in this version of Ghostbusters. Again, a different movie than the original two, who handle the adventure a little more dry. I really had a lot of fun with these sequences in Paul Feigs version, who, I think has gotten better at executing action sequences period. It's two steps above Spy. The flaws. The rules of the world are not the most clear. Especially near the end, during the climax of the film. Because of this, it's hard to fully grasp what is dangerous or not. The movie plays fast and loose with the dangers of the equipment, the ghosts and even the political threat and I was scratching my head trying to figure out what the gals can and can not do to stay safe. Hopefully they tighten those things up for the, what I hope, would be the second installment of this franchise. To sum up. There's room for both franchises. Refrain from comparing and contrasting. There are lots of cameos that bog down pacing in this reboot, but remember that the filmmakers did that for YOU, 1984 fans. How mad can you really stay mad at people trying to make you feel acknowledged and smile, while trying to do their own thing. If there wasn't so much uproar, maybe perhaps, they wouldn't feel the need to pander. To me, movies are sacred and I love them, but at the end of the day they are just movies. It's important to remember that and find that balance. Enjoy.",Ghostbusters

The experience was akin to watching your parents do taxes, or enduring Chinese drip torture. Something I particularly enjoyed about the film was when they had a character comment on every action any other character would do in a sympathetic tone and expecting the audience to laugh, because ""ha these girls are so goofy just like you and your girlfriends. i mean we all empathise right hahaha. Go make this into a gif and share it all over your facebook relating it to your own sorry sad lives"".Overall, it's top of the pops.

1830,brunagardel,funny people hang out and defeat ghosts,10,16 July 2016,"The chemistry between this four really funny women is the coolest thing the movie has to offer, just like the original did with its cast. The ladies play to their comedic strengths with characters that sort of reflect their personalities and there are several laugh out loud moments. The plot was okay, not worse but also not better when compared to the original. The exaggerated visual effects that are very characteristic to the franchise were well placed, just like the appearances of original cast members. It's not the best movie of the year, but then again neither were the originals when they were released. Even though some people say they don't see the point of this movie being remade, specially with women, I really hope the trend of remaking the classics with a female cast continues because little girls deserve to have characters they can look up to that is a reflection of themselves, just like little boys have been for so long. And for the love of god stop whining and trying to find reasons not to like it. Just embrace the awesomeness that are funny women.",Ghostbusters
1831,SharletteK,"This was really, really terrible!",2,12 July 2016,"They shot it in the bits!That line both speaks to how the final big bad ghost is brought down and also to the film itself. The creators of this rubbish absolutely shot this film in the bits with this script. It's so bad, and not the 'so bad it's good' type of bad, it's just utter rubbish. Maybe Americans will like this brainless, insipid, and funny-only-because- it-sucks-so-bad film, but no one I talked to leaving the cinema in Watford actually liked this, and it's not getting very good reviews from anywhere in the UK or Europe, except from those married to the 'not liking it is sexist' narrative started by the Americans. Well, I'm a woman, most of my friends are women, and none of us who went to see it together actually liked it. Best rating from any of us is 4 stars, but she was a bit sloshed before it even started. Breaking it down: Script: 1/10 (the script written by a computer algorithm was better than this)Acting: 3.5/10 (not really the cast's fault...they were brought down by the script)Effects: 2/10 (seriously, even the original Ghostbusters was more believable than this. Why did they have to make this look so horrible and obvious green-screen is obvious?Score: 1/10 (will leave you thrilled to get back out into the world and listen to traffic)Casting: 4/10 (this cast just didn't mix well, not even close to the great casting of the original)Plot: 0/10 (you can't set up a premise in the beginning of a film just to throw it in the bin and go another way later. What happens in the middle and end of this makes no sense given the premise set up by the original film and the beginning of this film)Politics: 3/10 (obvious man-hating is obvious...could have toned it down more than a bit, yeah?)Paid £13 to have my brain attacked by this horrible remake.

It's no half-assed remake, to be sure but a while new level of cool. My family and I had more fun watching the new Ghostbusters than wr had had watching ANYTHING else all year. Better plot, more science, funnier, and the action scenes actually worked IMHO. There were cameos and head nods and lots of applauds at the end (as well as hooting and laughter and shrieking from the audience throughout).And yes, guys, that's how it feels to be constantly sexualized and overlooked in movies. Honestly they turned a LOT of tropes on their heads and made some really valid points about life as a woman without ever actually making any effort at it or being preachy (like, dress code conundrums, how women make it through life getting overlooked or made fun of without turning homicidal, etc).",Ghostbusters

The technology was neither cutting edge, believable or retro. It looked like a toy company designed the toys first then they used them in the movie. The PKE meter is the prime example. Even the characters had the same feel. (minor spoiler) Mr & Mrs Slimer were basically the potato heads. No point, value or remotely scary. The design was closer to the cartoon port. In summary the movie didn't know what it was, a homage to the last movie, reboot or follow up. It tried to reboot while paying lip sink to the past and achieved neither.",Ghostbusters
1834,arizona-76029,Don't listen to the haters,9,15 July 2016,"I scrolled through the reviews quickly and saw nothing but negativity. I needed to say my peace. I'm not a professional movie reviewer. I'm an average gal, and frankly I've never written a review on here before. So bear with me because this review will be more emotional than technical.Here's what I want to say about this film: It was hilarious. I had a smile on my face the entire time. I laughed until I cried. I cried from laughing more when talking about it on the drive home. And the first thing I wanted to do when I left the theater was go see it again.I know this is a remake of a classic movie so that opens it up to a lot of criticism. But do yourself a favor...pretend you're a kid again and go see this movie with the intention of just being entertained instead of picking apart every second of it. Just have fun.That being said I wanted to give a nod to a few aspects. The cameos are perfect. The ghosts look awesome. Kate McKinnon is my new girl crush, I loved every aspect of her performance. To me, she stole the show along with Chris Hemsworth who was unexpectedly one of the most hilarious characters. The only reason I rated it a 9/10 instead of a 10/10 was because it needed more Chris.I hope this helps some of you regular folk who aren't ""professional"" critics and I hope everyone enjoys it as much as I did.Oh, and do yourself a favor and stay until the credits are over.",Ghostbusters

Like many, I'm usually skeptical about remakes, but with Ghostbusters, my main hope was that it would be fun and oddball, like the original but different, and it lived up to that. My only complaint is that there's one thing that I consider to be a plot hole, but a) this is an action comedy, not a movie where the plot is really the point, and b) I think the plot hole can be explained away when you consider the fact that the characters are not genre-savvy.There are lots of callbacks and cameos for original Ghostbusters fans, and lots of little things, like their gaining notoriety on YouTube, that make it feel modern without feeling like ""oh, look at us, it's Ghostbusters but with cell phones!"" See it in theaters while you can. It's not a movie you would go see specifically for the special effects, but they do add something on the big screen.",Ghostbusters

I want to see it because I was a fan of the 1984 version. I think what I was expecting were humor, entertainment and a decent story. What I got was good effects, humor, still fairly entertaining, the story is alright. Reboots of a cult classic is always hard, the cameos of the original cast was a nice touch. At times the jokes are slightly awkward and the whole male secretary aspect wasn't as funny as it must of been intended. However overall I still enjoyed it. Good pace, comparing to the 1984 version, I still liked that better but this is not as hard to watch as some of reviews here suggested. Overall, decent movie, still recommendable to others.",Ghostbusters

The fact it was a strong female cast should prove otherwise. Yes these were some ""girlie"" references, to which i felt it just built the persona of the cast. Although no one seemed to bat an eyelid it the original when Sigourney weaver was the prize turkey in the original ghost buster films.I watched it with the same intent as i did the ones in the 80's. Yes the story line wasn't as captivating as the original but the characters were. Melissa Mccarthy is one my favourite Actors and never fails to deliver. All in all a great family movie, just disregard the purist viewpoint and watch with fresh eyes",Ghostbusters
1839,notquitemarnie,"A great, modern summer comedy that does what it's meant to do and is an important addition to the sci-fi universe",8,13 July 2016,"It saddens me deeply that this movie has been surrounded by such blind hate from people who refuse to let go of the old ghostbusters and act like this film is the most offensive thing on the planet. Produced by Dan Akroyd and with cameos from almost all of the living ghostbusters, had this film not been poisoned by overly sensitive people on the internet it would have been a hit.The four leads display a wide range of personalities, from the nervous Erin (wiig) to the committed believer (Abbie) to the weird and quirky Holtzmann (Mckinnon) and the hilarious Patti (Jones) these are a set of 4 female characters that - unlike many movies we see - are focused on a scientific goal and not once do they have sex with someone (shock horror!).If you are reading this and do not understand why this is important then I doubt I will convince you by the end of this review, but I would be grateful if you were to listen to my opinion. Girls do not see this. This is not something that happens often, and it's important for women to see this.Special mention goes to McKinnon's character the engineer Gillian Holtzmann, who is not only strange, intelligent, gloriously weird and dressed like a post apocalyptic mad max-exque lesbian, but participates in a fight scene that made me understand why guys like action movies. Not once had I engaged with a fight scene the way I did watching a normal woman absolutely kick arse in one and that's the truth. (Also the gun-licking may have been a minor bisexual awakening)The humour of the movie matches a modern equivalent of the old ghostbusters, following the path of casting many Saturday night live alum, you can tell that many of the funny moments were improvised by the cast. Another special mention goes to Chris Hemsworth for his comedic delivery as the hilariously inept secretary Kevin, who covers his eyes when he hears loud noises. The rest of the humour is a combination of witty back and fourth, loud observational and sometimes just plain gross (it's a movie that involves sliming what does one expect) with a classic Paul Feig spin. To conclude, ghostbusters was a well done, funny, and groundbreaking movie that is absolutely not the horrid flop the internet wanted it to be. I would highly recommend it, in the large theatre I was in, I heard roaring laughter at every turn so do not listen to these internet commenters. Real people in the real world loved it, and I'm sure you will too.",Ghostbusters

I loved the original and thought a reboot would tarnish it, but honestly it was thrilling to see and feel some of the familiar tones and atmospheric spooks that I loved being translated for a new generation. A part of me wanted to dislike it on principle, as if I'm being disloyal to what made me love Ghostbusters to begin with, but I let that go and decided to ride the wave instead.Its true that I can see why the older folks might not like it, even I was like ""Whoa, slow down, there's too much going on."" but for this ADHD generation it was perfect and I loved seeing the enthusiasm of the young boys and girls, watching them fist pump and dance.

The point here is not feminist - although that's a point, too - the point is that the sexism of the original was bad, lazy film-making, that ruined my enjoyment of it - and would ruin how many young girls' enjoyment of it how much more? Of course, at the end of the day, it's just a Hollywood film. Don't expect anything profound or game-changing in it. But for what it is, it's great.",Ghostbusters

No. But if you want to have a fun time at the theatre with some friends, you will definitely enjoy the show. Despite all of the hate this movie is getting, it was nice to sit in the theatre and really enjoy the fun trip back to the 80s memory lane. Don't come in expecting Bridesmaids level hilarity. It has the same spirit of the first movie, where the jokes hit most of the time but aren't the driving force of the movie. It's not the best movie of the summer, but it doesn't deserve the amount of hate it's getting. I laughed out loud many times. The performance are great (specifically Leslie Jones and Kate McKinnon).

1843,jeaniulani,High hopes.... maybe too high...,2,12 July 2016,"I am not a ""hater"" by any stretch of the imagination. I am a fan of the Ghostbuster franchise, loved both the original movie and the sequel as well as the animated cartoon show. I went to this movie looking forward to a refreshing new take on the Ghostbusters and was very disappointed with what I got. Firstly, let me say that I'm not a GB fanboy/fangirl by any stretch and I'm not comparing this Ghostbusters to the original because it can't be compared. I wanted to see four powerful, smart and funny females rock this movie and show the ghosts who's boss. Sadly, despite my high hopes, this movie fell flat. Kristen Wiig's ""leading lady""-ish when it should have been Melissa McCarthy as the lead. Kristen's jokes were stale and the same jokes I've seen in dozens of her past movies, nothing particularly new or funny about it. Melissa McCarthy I felt was just a toss away in this movie. Why she wasn't given more lines, more starring scenes, I'll never understand. Perhaps because she's not an SNL alumni? I don't know. I felt like she was vastly underutilized and it's a crying shame because she is comedy gold in my eyes. They didn't use her enough. Her scenes that she did have a bigger part in, were funny. Kate McKinnon was great in her role. I see her becoming a new comedic lead and I honestly really love her and Leslie Jones from SNL. They're both very funny women but I feel like they weren't given enough room or a good enough script to let the comedic genius inside them shine bright. The movie apparently attacked anti-feminists before coming out and angered a lot of fanboys and I wasn't one of them but as a female leading movie, I think it was in poor taste to constantly bash men in the movie. I couldn't stand the guy who played Thor in his role and the overall anti-male tone of the movie just didn't sit well with me. You can be funny and feminist without constantly beating up men with jokes and remarks... The original Ghostbusters didn't sit and cut down women, why the new take on it with an all female cast felt the need to bash men just baffles me. It distracted from what could have been a great movie. If they replaced all of the man hate with jokes and maybe even a storyline ala Peter and Dana, perhaps with Kristen Wiig's character and male, it would have been a much better movie. Let's be honest, a lot of the content/premise was taken from the first movie but switched around a bit and less funny. The hint to Zuul in the after credits scene had me cringing. If they do a sequel let's hope for more laughs, more jokes and less hatefulness in the movie. It was just too much bashing and too little laughing for my taste.",Ghostbusters
1844,ciarda-94606,Quite a new take on a great film franchise,9,13 July 2016,"I got to see this film last Monday and tbh I was quite hesitant going in on how it would be.I am a big fan of both original films and the old 80's toon, that aside I found this film quite enjoyable its no way going to be a Shakespearean masterpiece so if that is what your expecting you should leave that thought at the door.I know a lot of people have criticized this film for its lack of practical effects but I though the initial Ghosts that appear in the film where well done. there is a few scenes later on that have many appear on screen so they tend to be not too distinctive.but tbh thinking back to the originals you didn't see that many on screen at the same time also.I will admit I was not impressed with Chris Hemsworths character Kevin I felt he was just to over the top for comic relief as the other Characters did a good job of keeping the humor going throughout.The main villain of the movie was interesting to say the least with out giving away any spoilers.All in all I found this movie to be very enjoyable and it shouldn't be dismissed just because it isn't a continuation of the original films.",Ghostbusters

Am I bias because I grew up during the time the original ghostbusters movies and cartoon came out, perhaps, but there was just so much wrong with this movie. It could have been good, it had the makings to be good and it just went in the opposite direction of that. It relied way to heavily on CGI special effects making the ghosts not even look like ghosts but something out of a comic book. The acting was subpar, like the actors knew the script wasn't any good. I love these ladies as actors but they played their roles pretty flat. The only character I did enjoy was Holtzmann because she was that perfect level of insane craziness mixed with major nerd. But yeah overall, just no. This was a reboot of something that didn't need to be remade (Hollywood needs to stop doing this seriously) they obviously wanted this to be something new and different from the original and yet they kept throwing in cameos, the bust statue of Harold Ramis at the beginning, catch phrases from the original movie, imagery and even certain ghosts. This would have been so much better if they had made it a continuation of the original acknowledging the previous events of the first movies and the original ghostbusters and continued on with their work.

Then there was a big online scandal with an extensive use of words: feminism, sexism, misogyny and what not. So I was frustrated about the movie before I even watched it. You know what I think about it after I watched it? Critics are not to be trusted!Don't get me wrong here. If you are a die-hard fan of original Ghostbusters and you are craving to see a remake, you kind of get concerned when you realize that Ghostbusters are not even men anymore. But then if you think about it, if the original movie was a 2016 remake, it would get the same public response. So why is it not concerning for people how women were portrayed in the original movie, but so concerned about how 1 male character is portrayed in a new one? This is not a ""metacritic score"". This is a METAHYPOCRISY score!So let's just take all this sexist hypocrisy out of the way and look at the movie with a new look.Movie was great. I was super excited to hear the familiar soundtrack, familiar nerdy character to it. It was a real Ghostbusters movie all the way. The cameos of original actors were a nice dessert. Let's face the fact, it does not matter, if Chris Hemsworth character was ""not so clever"", you will love to see him having fun through the process all the way.

1849,skyblueads,So utterly disappointing,2,23 July 2016,"So then, Paul Feig's Ghostbusters reboot. Firstly I have to say that I really wanted to like the film - I've adored the original for 30 years and as a child was obsessed with all things Ghostbusters. Anything that brings Ghostbusters back to popular culture can only be a good thing. However I didn't like it. The humour of the film is very flat and broad. If the idea of making someone listen to a recording of a fart is your cup of tea, then great. You'll probably like this. Chris Hemsworth's Kevin is completely unfunny and the joke wears thin very quickly. The cameos are poor, very poor, with the exception of Annie Potts, who's awesome, but blink and you'll miss her. There was no need for Slimer's cameo - his effect and design is poor too. The last 3rd of the film comes across as a live-action version of The Real Ghostbusters cartoon, albeit with different Ghostbusters. The weirdest thing about the whole film is it's tone. It's so off. The jokes bonk you over the head, there's no subtlety, no nuance. The one time the bust a ghost (the dragon - why a dragon? More Real Ghostbusters playing into the script is my thinking) it feels almost like Ghostbusters but then it falls away The mannequin scene could have been great and legitimately scary, but it's over so quickly. And the Ozzy Osbourne cameo is woeful. In the 1984 original the movie is acted with a serious tone - almost as if it's a horror, the jokes come from Akroyd/Ramis/Hudson/Murray reaction to the situation their in- this is written very flatly - there's no depth to the characters. At all. So disappointing - there's potential here, but it's all undone by a messy script, unfunny jokes and a climax that's cartoonish with no sense of jeopardy. I've been waiting 27 years for this and I'm gutted.",Ghostbusters

This movie was full of Easter eggs which is pretty amusing when you're familiar with the original franchise, but it's also fun to watch when you have no clue what you're getting into. Of course you shouldn't be expecting a movie with a lot of depth or complex story lines, this is a comedy! Sure, I wouldn't have mind if it was a little scarier like the originals but i think that's the point of this movie. They made it for everyone to enjoy.

1851,meobrien-81730,A great summer movie-ignore the haters,8,15 July 2016,"I saw the film last night at a Thursday preview with my sister. I have not seen the original Ghostbusters, but this remake I felt captured the spirit (no pun intended) of the original film franchise from all the press I have read regarding men who can't deal with women being able to do anything a man has done since the dawn of time.Anyway, the film was a blast. All four leads were hilarious and lots of loud laughter could be heard throughout the theater I was in. Chris Hemsworth was great as the lovable moron secretary Kevin. The pacing was , and even the ghosts can give you a bit of a jump. I'm not sure if it was intentional, but there was lots of jokes and such in the later part of the film that could be read as digs to the wimps who kvetch about things behind a keyboard that they haven't even seen yet. The humor was effortless and sharp, though in two occasions it was a bit drawn out. The subtle nods to the original franchise were subtle and appropriate and *spoiler* the film was dedicated to Harold Ramis, the Ghostbusters actor who died a few years back. He even got a cameo as a bust in the first few minutes of the film.All in all a great summer movie to just relax and escape life for two hours.

1852,Raamah,Not worth watching.,2,30 September 2016,"The jokes all fell flat, the movie was simply boring. My wife fell asleep, my daughter was not paying attention after the first 20 minutes and I managed to struggle to stay awake for the whole thing to give it a fair chance to impress.I have nothing against any of the actresses and actors, they all are talented, they simply had a terrible script to work with. The old movie was funny, the characters had great chemistry together and the story flowed well so there were no moments of boredom. Chris Hemsworth seemed like cameo that went on way too long and simply wasn't that funny, he was more eye-candy for the ladies than anything with his dance routine. I don't mind a ""dumb guy"" joke but being bashed over the head with it every 10 minutes was a bit much. I think there were much better opportunities for comedy that were missed. The ghostbusters seemed to have no chemistry together. Kristen Wiig was awkward to watch, fumbling around doing stupid things that made no sense for a scientist (trying to slide open restaurant windows?) she didn't even seem like part of the team at times as she was running off on her own. Melissa McCarthy was annoying. Leslie Jones was tolerable, she played the role that was assigned to her very well and had some decent moments in the film. My favorite of the ghostbusters was Kate McKinnon for her randomness, she was a bright moment in a poor film.The story was bland, uninteresting and the scenes where nothing really was happening seemed to drag on forever. The villain is boring and at times the movie just seems to be an excuse to cameo every actor from the old movie. A cameo in a movie is fine but there are like 5 in this one and they are not subtle at all (and not funny either). There is very little action in the movie although there was one moment at the end where Kate McKinnon had a pretty cool action scene. Another unfortunate for me was the addition of some heavy language and innuendo at times, the old movie was great to watch as a family, fairly tame for younger children, this movie ruins that with some pretty nasty sexual references, the f-bomb and occasional swearing. Totally unnecessary in this movie. I love comedy movies and this one didn't get even one genuine laugh out of me, what a flop and what a disappointment.I know there are lots of people claiming that the bad reviews are sexist, however in my opinion this movie wasn't let down because of the female characters at all but rather by it's poor script (For example, why do the proton packs kill the ghosts at the end? In other parts of the movie they just hold them for the trap! Why aren't the ghostbusters killed when they cross the streams? Why can the villain control the army but not the ghostbusters?). I think given a funny original script this movie could have been great with it's actors and actresses. I was saddened to see this garbage dedicated to Harold Ramis, he must be spinning in his grave.",Ghostbusters

I went in extremely skeptical and was truly surprised at how much I loved it. Honestly, its such a great story, well made film, and an excellent tribute to the original. Maybe a remake wasn't totally necessary, but really whats the harm? Remaking this movie didn't destroy all copies of the original! It still exists and its still great! And this movie is great too!

Bringing in Venkman's tape from another dimension, discovering Zul. I found this movie to be as funny as the original. Go see it and judge for yourself though.",Ghostbusters

With Kate McKinnon's Sweetheart A Funny Movie That Decorates.Parapsychologists Peter Venkman, Raymond Stantz, and Egon Spengler are called to the New York Public Library to investigate recent paranormal activity. They encounter the ghost of a librarian, who haunted a librarian named Alice but are frightened away when she shape shifts into a horrifying monster. After losing their jobs at Columbia University, the trio establish a paranormal investigation and elimination service known as ""Ghostbusters"". They develop high-tech equipment capable of capturing ghosts and open their business in a disused, run-down firehouse. Egon warns them never to cross the energy streams of their proton pack weapons, as this could cause a catastrophic explosion. They capture their first ghost, Slimer, at a hotel and deposit it in a specially built containment unit in the firehouse basement. As paranormal activity increases in New York City, they hire a fourth member, Winston Zeddemore, to cope with demand.",Ghostbusters

I walked out of that theater absolutely swooning with love for those women and their characters, and with my stomach and face hurting from laughing and smiling. Of course it's not a perfect movie; what is? But I'm dizzy with joy that something so fun and funny and showcasing so many talented, amazing women (Leslie Jones was the highlight of the movie, in my opinion). It made me laugh, it spooked me a little (the ghosts were downright creepy!), and it made me care about the characters. It paid tribute to the originals without just being a direct rehash - it was a love letter. Yes, Hollywood, please keep making movies that are about more than just straight white guys. There are other people out there, and they deserve to have stories about them, too.",Ghostbusters

The ""Girl Power"" failed attempt failed because men will be turned off to this movie. Many will blame men as the reason for the failure for this movie, but this movie failed to court men in any capacity which is why you are seeing all this heat around this movie. Each lead is funny in there own right, but not as a team. The chemistry is just not there and they force it which is the wrong thing to do. The ending completely ended any love I had for the franchise with the massive release of ghost. It just looked silly with all the CGI used and the ghost look like they were borrowed from a Disneyland ride.",Ghostbusters
1858,havealwayshope,I actually enjoyed myself,9,19 August 2018,"I'd like to make it clear, I love the originals, I wore out my VHS of the first film. Recently (last month) I showed the original to a group of 12yr olds, they found it cheesy, obvious and said it was chasing the jokes. They couldn't see why it was a cult classic. They didn't mind the poor effects (a large group of them like other 80's films). They also disliked the stereotypes in the film, the needy woman, the weak geek etc. They had a point, this new film is no worse, yes the jokes are obvious, yes it's on the nose, but I did laugh. 
I liked the takeaway issues, the comments on property prices, the linking of the ghosts to science rather than an ancient god. They had chase scenes, some good fights, and the cast gelled well. I also was happy with a new storyline, it worked in the genre, but didn't erase the old story.",Ghostbusters

Great humor (with some groaners) and some spectacular effects. Many cameos from the old cast, even one from Ramis, if you're quick enough to see it. The ghost fight near the end? Beauty in motion. You get to see the old tech used in new and entirely exciting ways. Holtzmann is a beast. I really do hope they'd make a sequel, just to see where it goes. I left the movie and my face hurt from smiling. Would definitely go see it again in a heartbeat.",Ghostbusters
1860,Krusiv,Average fluff piece with a brilliant cast. Haters are beyond delusional.,6,9 August 2017,"You have got to be kidding me. This is the movie that has caused so much hatred, rage, and controversy? This harmless, average, fun fluff piece? Pretty much everyone already knew if they liked the film or not before it was even released. I think a lot of people need a reality check not only on this reboot but on the original as well. Hailing the original as some sacramental divine piece of cinema that cannot be improved on is a complete joke. No, I don't hate the original. No, I don't love the reboot. They are both somewhere in between with the original barely edging this out in terms of filmmaking. If we were to rate comedies on their ""laughs-per-minute"" then the edge would go to this reboot.But how, when the special effects in the reboot are clearly superior? Turns out that there is far more to film technicalities than bright lights, pretty colors, and realistic green slime. Where Ghostbusters (2016) falters is in the editing and how the humor is set up. The film is too focused on being a ball-busting roller-coaster ride; rarely stopping to catch its breath. There are quite a few legitimately funny bits in here that could have landed even better if the editing was more precise. Silence and patience can work wonders in action comedies. Hell, just look at what Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton were doing literally one hundred years ago.The cast members are at their best when they aren't forced into doing line-o-rama improv. I found Leslie Jones and Melissa McCarthy to be the shining stars of this with Kristen Wiig and Kate McKinnon not far behind. McCarthy notably is a groan-inducer to most, but she does well in films that she or her husband did not write or direct (Spy, St. Vincent, and now this). Jones acts as the grounded everywoman who keeps the nutty ghost hunters in line, and for my money has the best comedic timing out of the four. McKinnon seems to have downed a few energy drinks before every shoot as she is incredibly extra in every scene, often more so than required. Wiig tries to bring an emotional backstory to the picture but it gets lost in all of the neon rainbow effects.If you're one of the few somehow still on the fence about this: give it a try. It won't ruin your childhood, or kick your dog, or kill your family. At worst you'll walk away unamused and then proceed to pop in the original.",Ghostbusters
1861,micromaster-17087,Horrible,1,23 July 2016,"Probably the worst movie of the decade. It has blatant sexism towards males, the acting is that of a crappy comedy movie (which the movie primarily is), the cgi is horrible and what I hate most is that the director is having a Hissy fit because people hate this movie and they are saying that if you dislike this movie you are a sexist. which is a horrible thing to do. I very much hate this movie. But everyone is entitled to there own opinion. In conclusion you should not see this movie and probably watch the original. i really do not like this movie the entire cast does a horrible job it would have been way better to have the original cast (except Harold Ramis) or just build off the existing movies. I hope this movie flops and does not go well at the box office. this movie uses double standards and thinks that it is funny well it is not it is probably one of the worst movies of all time more worse than troll 2.",Ghostbusters
1862,lilykittenpoo,Hilarious and refreshing,8,4 August 2016,"I really can't understand all of the bad reviews this movie is getting. The movie is ridiculous because hey, it's a movie about a bunch of people that go around fighting ghosts in New York City using things like nuclear lasers. Obviously the original Ghostbusters is a cult classic, so the new one has a lot to live up to. In my opinion the 2016 version did a fantastic job of giving a nod to the original version, all without being too derivative, and managed to make the story fresh and modern by hilariously referencing current culture.As far as remaking the film with all women, it felt gimmicky only because it flipped the typical stereotype and so few films do; no one batted an eye that the original Ghostbusters featured a team of all men. That's really the point and necessity of films like this one, and I hope the bad reviews this movie is getting will not dissuade other filmmakers from taking similar risks in the future. I must say that, personally, this film was so incredibly refreshing. I am in my early thirties, born right at the height of the original Ghostbusters popularity: some of my earliest childhood memories were playing with Ghostbusters action figures, acting out scenes from the film with my brother, and endlessly singing the theme song. Being a nerd in all the right ways, I ended up growing up to become an experimental physicist with a Ph.D.; and for what it's worth, I also happen to be a woman. Maybe I'm taking the film too seriously, but as I was sitting in the theater watching the new Ghostbusters, I couldn't help reflecting on how few films there are that actually feature women as real, live intelligent human beings who can be just as nerdily interested in something as men can. Almost without exception, female characters are relegated to the role of the love interest, and if she is shown to be intelligent or have some nerdy hobby, it's solely as the catalyst for the leading man's interest in her. When I think back to my own childhood favorite films, I had almost no real role models to look up to; one of my favorite films was The Saint, which does in fact have a female scientist as one of the main characters, but it's pretty much the only film I can think of that does. That character is also not nearly as amazingly three-dimensional and hilariously unique as the leading ladies in Ghostbusters are. I'm so glad that the next generation of girls will grow up with a few more eccentrically hilarious female characters to look up to.",Ghostbusters

Its a boring movie, it is like watching something and then not remember what you watched. If this was a food review the food would been without seasoning. No build up, no feeling and I think my kids would have done a better job reading the script. I had an open mind, I tried to lower my expectations lower than the lowest of low.

This was one of the most fun movies I've seen in awhile, the girls were spot on and even Chris' character ""Kevin"" was a blast. From the moment the film started it never seemed to lag. In fact, I wish there were 30 extra minutes of it. It never felt rushed, but I didn't want to see the characters go. The villain was the biggest flaw in this film. There was hardly any insight into his thinking. But he still was not too bad. As a fan of the original two films, I was worried this one would just be a copy. I was wrong. Yes there were many similarities, but the idea of this was original enough to work. It is great for those new to Ghostbusters, but even die hard fans can enjoy it. P.S. I was not paid yo give this a more positive review, there are people who actually liked it. I'm tired of any good review for this movie to be brushed offed and accused of being a sell out.",Ghostbusters

Do not think about watching it, do not buy the DVD!The movie started weak, then continued weak and ended weak. The actors seamed to be forced to make the Movie. It appears as the cast was taken out of the Teletubbies TV serial. The Jokes are flat, and dumb. The flick has a low drama curve, it fails to create tension. The special effects are not state of the art(altho i would say they were the most professional part of the movie). Directing was not bad either. I guess the worst part was the script and the exicution of it. I hope that the studios wont make another!",Ghostbusters
1867,daniakito,"Ghostbusters is colourful, extremely fun, and very funny!",8,12 July 2016,"Fans rejoice! The new Ghostbusters movie is not, in fact, the childhood crushing disaster that some feared after less than seller trailers, but a colourful, extremely fun, very funny romp of a re- take on a classic. One that spends just the right amount of time paying sometimes cheeky, but always respectful homage to the original (with fantastic cameos from all of the living original cast) without being a slave to it. It cheerfully moves with its own style and its own brand of humour, which is consistently delightful thanks to the very genuine chemistry of the four leads. Each character is distinctive and quirky and the ghosts are purposefully stylised in a way that lends itself well to the bombastic tone of the movie. There are gadgets and techie jargon to satisfy the nerdiest of fans, and a surprising amount of scares.Of my few complaints, one would be that the villain is noticeably under-developed in a way that is detrimental to the plot. While this complaint could also be levied at the original too, it feels more noticeable here. This also creates pacing issues which are problem from act 2 onwards and the emotional climax of the movie, as well as the weight the stakes hold for the Ghostbusters personally, suffer for it. But these problems are pretty secondary when you're laughing so hard. Ghostbusters is nothing like a cynical cash grab, with Feig and his cast's want to entertain their audience evident in every frame.A quick note on the biased mess this page has become thanks to an unfortunate few: As you can probably tell from the paranoid tone of many of these reviews, they don't seem particularly balanced or fair. This would be because they aren't. There has been a concerted effort from people who are angry this movie exists and is reviewing well to bombard this place due to its more open nature. It's amusing that there is a conspiracy theory among these people that there is foul play from Sony with this movie reviewing so positively among professional critics, when in fact there are organised downvote campaigns from people who have yet to actually SEE the movie! So no, you don't need to take these people seriously. As you can see from their paranoid claims that Sony are secretly paying-off critics to give this movie positive reviews (a technique they've apparently forgotten to utilise for any of their other more expensive movies, which have been panned critically this year), these are just the last trashing of a small but vocal group of adult children.",Ghostbusters
1868,jendolyn-26572,Ignore the idiots giving this bad reviews,9,22 July 2016,"Interestingly enough, pretty much ALL the bad reviews I've seen are from men. They're all complaining about how men are portrayed as stupid, etc., when I doubt one of them would have complained had the roles been reversed. Because they're used to having the dumb-as-rocks eye-candy aimed at THEM. How about all the women go back and rate down every movie where the women are portrayed as helpless, stupid, big-boobed morons? Men don't mind those, because hey, that's how it is, right? Literally the only reason most of them hate this movie is because the gender roles are reversed, so no matter what, they are determined to stick with that. I don't care if people call this a reboot, or remake. I'd call it neither. Much like the 'reboot' of Total Recall, there are similarities between the movies, but there are so many more DISSIMILARITIES that they each need to be taken on their own merit and not compared to each other.Anyway, despite the reviews, the movie is actually really good. The chemistry between the cast is great, the storyline, aside from the basic 'group of ghosthunters', is original and entertaining, and the subtle and not-so- subtle shoutouts to the originals are great. The cameos by the original crew minus Harold Ramis are awesome, and all 3 of the living, original Ghostbusters LOVE this movie.So instead of hating it based on some reviews by baby boys who would prefer not to see themselves portrayed as women have been for decades, listen to the people who ARE Ghostbusters. And for the record, my husband and son saw no sexism, anti-man BS like other reviewers are saying. I guess if you're determined to hate something, you'll make up whatever reason you think will work best. Give it a chance on its own merits. You'll be pleasantly surprised!",Ghostbusters

I don't want to spoil the movie for others, but if you saw the first and wanted to see more than you might feel like me. It the time they took to tell the story, I think it could have been much better told.I didn't care for the all girl cast and making men look stupid.

1871,akzapricorn,Favorite Reboot Yet!!,8,22 July 2016,Most people are criticizing it for being unnecessary but when you think about it nobody did this about in independence day 2 and that was terrible. This movie did everything it was supposed to do and it was great but the only reason it's receiving hate is because it's Ghostbusters and people don't like it when you take away their childhood. But if you saw the movie you'd know that it isn't doing that because if you don't like the idea of it just don't see it and don't ruin it for every one else! Overall this movie is one of my favorites I think there's tons of hilarious jokes a lot coming from Chris Hemsworth and Kate McKinnon surprisingly. My advice to you if you like Ghostbusters or just good funny movies this is a MUST SEE!,Ghostbusters
1872,alexwargo,This is a review from a casual standpoint.,8,2 August 2016,"Honestly, when it comes to the movie it wasn't bad. Now before the entire internet comes down and crucifies me, just hear me out. From my perspective I thought it was a good movie when you look at it on its own. The movie's plot was I thought good, look it was a standard plot, compare it to the fifty- million movies about ""edgy"" teens taking on the system, the movie was a fantastically original plot. Now when it comes down to the brass tacks, the movie was just about busting ghosts, and being just fun. I feel like some people are taking out of proportion (seriously some reviews say stuff like, in the finale when McCarthy, and Wig have white hair, their eye lash colors don't change.) Look I'm not one of those feminists who think that all men are evil, and would defend this movie like crazy, but if you look at it, it really wasn't bad. Honestly I just think people are salty about them putting women in the suits. In conclusion from a casual standpoint it was a pretty good movie.",Ghostbusters

For example, there is a scene in the end credits that was obviously cut from the main feature and should have been left in.Ignore the woman haters.

And Mccarthy and wigglw will never fail to make you laugh. 3.the women were and are cooler and funnier. 4.it never fails to make you laugh your pants off. 5. The cameos were lovely. 6. It's a great combination of comedy and a teeny weenie bit of horror (makes you jump) 7.it's absolutely funny and entertaining. 8. The ghosts in the movie were pretty awesome. 9.the music itself pumps you up, as there are more than a ghost-busters song. Each sung by different singers. 10. It's amazing.simply amazing. Don't care about what anybody says about this movie and go watch it yourself, and trust me you won't be sorry. You will see that a lot of effort was put in this movie. P.s: watching it 3D is a must. Thank you😊:)",Ghostbusters
1875,den-34391,It's Just Fun As Hell,10,16 July 2016,"I'm sure we all know why so many people insist that the film is trash. It's female driven. I guess some men are too sensitive to handle women as the stars, or maybe the few jokes about men in the film hurt their feelings. Who knows? I don't. All I know is that I'm not gonna wax political here, I'll just tell you that it's a solid comedy with a sense of humor pretty reminiscent of the original. The CGI was great and just cartoonish enough to walk the line between fun and convincing. The script was good, and made better by the delivery of the actresses (McKinnon in particular was a gem). Chris Hemsworth was a great addition and was funnier than I thought he'd be given his lack of comedic roles. I'm giving it a 10 for the sheer joy I had watching it. It's just fun as f*** and that's what a comedy in this vein should be. Kudos to everyone involved in making it.Overall, I laughed a hell of a lot and I hope other studios take note: female driven films need to be 100 times more common than they are right now because I think most people are tired of seeing the same five white guys play the same five characters in every comedy ten times a year. It's old, guys. Anything you do over and over again is old. Make more films like this, though maybe not another reboot or remake. I miss original screenplays. But I digress. Just give me more women on screen.TLDR; If you wanna have a good time and laugh for a good couple hours, go see this.",Ghostbusters
1876,BerlitzFrench,Seriously- women playing scientists?,8,15 July 2016,"I seriously cannot believe that Paul Feig and Katie Dippold were daft enough to think women could play plausible scientists. OK, who cares that 46% of all recent Ph.D. recipients were women? So what if 47% of medical school graduates possess the very ovaries they studied in their gynecology rotation! Does it really matter that the overall growth percentage of science and engineering degrees being awarded to women is higher than STEM degrees being awarded to men? After all, it is a well known fact that cold, hard statistics accrued by the National Science Foundation and the American Association of Medical Colleges are just wrong, wrong, wrong. I just don't think people whose bodies contain uteri can understand math and physics like men. Shame on you, Paul and Katie!And what were they thinking when they decided to remake a classic film? We have these treasured do-overs that were totally necessary to take our hard-earned cash in the theaters: 1. Clash of the Titans 2. Karate Kid (I mean, that Jaden kid so totally crane-kicked Macchio's bum) 3. Robocop 4. Footloose 5. Total Recall 6. Evil Dead 7. Nightmare on Elm Street 8. Friday the 13th 9. Annie 10. PoltergeistI am so glad that the above films received the same amount of vitriol and negative publicity as this reboot of Ghostbusters. After all, very few reboots/remakes ever succeed in the box office or even surpass the originals. OK, so yeah, let's forget about 1. True Grit 2. Star Trek 3. Mad Max: Fury Road 4. Rise of the Planet of the Apes (A remake of a reboot, even!) 5. X Men: First Class 6. Batman Begins 7. Casino Royale 8. Ocean's Eleven 9. The Departed (remake of Hong Kong film 'Infernal Affairs') 10. Maltese Falcon I mean, these were just flukes, and there is absolutely no conceivable way that reboots or remakes deserve to blacken the memory of the original. I mean, Annie Potts, Bill Murray, Dan Ackroyd, Ernie Hudson, and Sigourney Weaver all thought that the reboot was a bad idea- right? They wouldn't even consider cameos in a film that was such a flat-out horrid idea. I'm so glad that Leonard Nimoy, Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen didn't think enough of their classic film reboots to participate (either in cameo or significant role) in the newer films. My final beef with this film? Let's face it...female led films and franchises ALWAYS tank at the box office. Yes, I realize that Aliens, Hunger Games, Resident Evil and Underworld all spawned sequels due to their success, but women just can't headline a film. I really don't care that research shows that movies from 2006 - 2015 that had female protagonists out-grossed their male counterparts by nearly 50 million dollars per film. Facts, schmacts. Every single person who purchased a ticket to a female-led film is just an angry feminist man-hater with 14 cats and an unhealthy relationship with yogurt.I salute those of you who reviewed a film you didn't even see. It takes a lot of courage to speak with authority on something you know absolutely nothing about. That is quite brazen, and I tip my hat to you. You were in my thoughts as I chuckled, chortled, and flat out sniggered throughout Ghostbusters today.",Ghostbusters

Save the precious moments of life that could be BETTER spent writhing in pain from a wild animal attack. There was no originality, no three dimensional characters and absolutely no heart to the performances of the main four. There was a ""your mama"" joke that actually fell flat, though. I imagine upon seeing the progress of the film, the studio assumed that they either had to scrap the whole project and start over or just punt and run out the tape and hope for a good opening before the reviews.

The only draw to this movie is the Ghostbusters title. I don't know how much money the studio had to pay all these sites, critics and bloggers to give this movie a good rating but they must have done something because no normal human being will like this movie.

The gadgets Kate's character makes in the film are incredibly cool.

Every original Ghostbuster also makes a cameo in a creative and hilarious way, and I can see why all of those guys love this remake. I only saw the original once or twice, because I couldn't get into it. I couldn't relate to any of the characters. But I'll watch this movie over and over, probably at least once more in theaters.

1883,carrot-64779,Enjoyed it thoroughly,9,6 October 2016,"So everyone is posting this gumph about the film being either man hating or lacking in laugh out loud moments but as a man who loves and grew up with the originals I can't understand a bit of the negative reviews. The originals had little to no laugh out loud moments, the first ghost busters movie was a massive gamble for the studio but it paid off cause it was quirky and the characters were likable, I can't see any difference in this film! I loved it, the characters and the plot was daft but worthy as much as any of the other films and I saw absolutely no difference in the cast being entirely female, they made a likable film and that really shouldn't be news these days. As for those writing saying that most positive reviews on this site are by first time reviewers and implying they have some vested interests therein, don't be so stupid, I think like me most people putting up positive reviews just liked the film and were incensed by so much negative misogynistic press that they wanted their first review to be for a good film like this that needs some backing against the trolls. I hope there's a second film, I'll pay to see it and come back for another review",Ghostbusters
1884,imdb-33686,A bad reboot,3,7 August 2016,"Seams like every movie needs to have a reboot these days I just wonder why. Especially if the result is as bad as this film.Story: It's the old story retold. This isn't a bad thing, it's just un-original. Visuals: I found the visuals to be very good, especially in 3DCharacters: There is a gender switch for all characters. This isn't a problem per se. But they should have left it at that. Instead, they introduced the ""comedy"" factor, which basically transforms all characters into stupid cliché zombies. And I'm not only talking about the main characters. Every one was dumb as soup! Not only were the texts *not* funny at all (I had to laugh twice the whole movie), the frequency of the ""jokes"" is just to dense and made me think of the characters as brainless amoebas. Even the ""Dumb and Dumber"" guys look like smart people in comparison. In addition, they serve every cliché you can think of (eg. they hire the most stupid guy just for the looks). The adversary was embarrassing and pathetic, his actions illogical and inconsistent.So to sum everything up: This is a bad movie, not worth watching, not worth buying, not even worth downloading. The only good thing about this movie are the visuals. I think I would have given the film 5 stars if it were a silent film.",Ghostbusters
1885,madelaine-42530,The low whinging reviews here are misleading.,10,16 July 2016,"Ithought the movie was excellent. It was funny, engaging and I was genuinely interested in the movie. I had seen the original and thought that was hilarious so I was a bit apprehensive about this one living up to it. But I was pleasantly surprised. The chemistry between the four was wonderful and was overall a great movie.So looking at the score it has on IMDb has me scratching my head. Why is it so low on here? Why do all the professional reviewers agree with me about how good the movie is but these reviews don't? I read through the reviews here and it's funny how all the low ratings are from men. Do you guys have that much of an issue with women playing a role that was originally male? The sad thing is I know for certain if this was a remake with all males, it wouldn't have been rated so low.",Ghostbusters
1886,lyingtotheface,Don't believe the professional critic reviews,1,13 July 2016,"This has got to be the worst reboot I've seen since Godzilla. If this doesn't ruin Paul Feig's career especially with his behavior towards the people who didn't like this movie, then there's something wrong with Hollywood. Dialogue is cringe worthy and nothing is quotable like the original. For a movie that was made in 2016, the CGI is garbage. They capture 1 ghost in the entire movie, and then crap all over the lore in the final battle as they straight up start killing the ghosts. The 4 have no chemistry and instead of being fleshed out are just basic caricatures. Shy nerdy girl, Fat obnoxious girl (physical comedy, she fall down), weirdo girl, and loud black woman. Every man is either an a**hole or an idiot which of course because this is a ""feminist"" film, we need to show off the sexism against men (IMDB wouldn't let me put the word for hatred of men for some reason) and don't tell me it's not there. Feig released a article exclaiming men weren't funny just the other day from the time I post this. The climax involves them shoot the crotch of the totally original and not all Stay Puft Marshmallow Man, I'm sorry the Ghostbusters symbol. This movie is the fever dream of a white knight feminist ""ally"" who has to show the women how he totally isn't like those other guys. Ironic part is that the best character in this movie is Chris Hemsworth's character. A man is the best character in your feminist film where you intentionally tried to make them men crappy. Paul Feig, you need to quit your day job.",Ghostbusters
1887,markmarquez-89469,My review of Ghostbusters (2016) | MY FIRST REVIEW,6,19 July 2016,"Honestly, this was a bit better than I expected. First of all, I kinda agree with the negative reviews, the humour barely made me laugh (my mother kept laughing at every joke I didn't laugh at) & it felt like the scriptwriters simply took the script of the original Ghostbusters and modified it a bit. The cast is good, not gonna lie, I liked the cameos from the original Ghostbusters cast members & the VFX looked great, also the Ghostbusters logo as the final ghost villain was very surprising to me. So to summarize this review, here's a short sentence.The movie is good enough, cast is good, VFX is great, writing was a bit sloppy & the music was OK. Rating: 6.5/10",Ghostbusters

The humor, which in some very brief moments felt a little much, was very balanced with the story and the creepiness of the ghosts. Anyone who judges this movie based on what they think they know or what they saw just in trailers will really miss out on a good movie. It was a lot of fun, the story was actually good and the little bit of fan service and self deprecating humor were well placed. It is definitely worth checking out. I will also add that I think the 3D for this is worth the extra money and that theme song everyone was so enraged about is only in the movie itself for less than a minute total.",Ghostbusters
1891,harjitsohal,I want this to be great regardless of gender!,2,1 October 2016,"Despite mass negative social media I wanted this to be great! After the twenty or so minutes intro, this never really feels like a Ghostbusters movie. For me it also did not work as a comedy, containing few moments of real laughter. The actors previous work has proved their worth, but are incorrectly cast, also never gel.The movie suffers an identity crisis never knowing if it's a Ghosterbusters or Paul Feig comedy, ultimately the director has shown his limitations with a drastically disappointing Ghosterbusters film. Did I love the originals, yes, did female casting make this movie bad no. Now we are at the mercy of Sony..... reboot anyone.",Ghostbusters
1892,hmswilliams,Bad Scripts Make Bad Movies,1,13 July 2016,"Here are the major problems for the movie. The original Ghostbusters was a vehicle for Bill Murray, nothing more. Murray was a hot commodity coming off Caddyshack and Stripes and a strong supporting performance in Tootsie. If anyone else but Murray had been cast as Peter Venkman, even the original would have bombed. Most of the comedy comes in Murray's slacker/con-man manipulation of the other characters and no one does that better than Bill Murray. He's a guy living off of Government grants for junk science which played very well in 1984 when everyone loved Reagan for calling out Government ineptitude.The new movie is NOT an obvious vehicle for anyone. There is not one person in the movie that has captured the goodwill of movie goers the way Bill Murray had with his previous roles. It's not the concept of an all female Ghostbusters that is making it tank. It's that they annihilated the very recipe that made the first one successful.They actually COULD have made a really funny movie with the female cast. But they needed to make it a clear vehicle for one of them; and they needed to keep with the theme of a cynical con artist gaming the system for her own selfish ends. That was the key element that made the first movie tick. Vinkman didn't believe any of the stuff he was promoting. It was the work of his two assistants who were real scientists that threw him into the world of real ghosts that raised the stakes for Venkman.This is Plot Development 101 and they ignored it completely, opting instead for a preachy SJW plot of ""women not being taken seriously by stupid men"". THAT's why the movie is going to fail. It's a bad script that disrespects the audience.",Ghostbusters
1893,mjgreenhaus,Something Strange in The Neighborhood.,2,20 July 2016,"***spoiler alert***Very disappointing at best. The movie pays tribute to every major Ghostbusters event. Lines from both movies, scenes from the video game, and even slimer driving the NEW ecto 1 (from the Real GB cartoon pilot). The GB team is awkward their tools are called weird names and not really explained on how there used. The CGI ghosts are too much and too many. It's not funny either. Bill Murray's character is extremely weird and not necessary. The mayor is a joke. And most of all Ghostbusters is a NYC movie ! Masking Boston as NYC is a mistake. I like that the subway is involved because the subway is a big part of NYC but any New Yorker or commuter can obviously tell it's not NYC. They are made up NYC subway stations using the Boston T.Walter Peck called the originals frauds. He was 32 years too early. This movie is the real fraud..",Ghostbusters

1898,yaboydonyell,I know who I'm gonna call...,1,12 July 2016,"...The cinema who made me pay for this crap for my money back. Honestly, I was actually kinda looking forward to seeing Hollywood open up a new female lead genre. It should have been used to show cinema goers and children and women and men that it's OK for women to be leads. I hate this movie. And don't say because I am Male that I am automatically sexist. I genuinely feel sorry for Chris Hemsworth and Sigourney Weaver and Bill Murray and all the talented actors and actresses who were involved in this monster. The Script is awful. 40% of the lines are Melissa McCarthy and Kristen Wiig rambling and bickering on and on and on... 20% is Leslie Jones' Stereotypical Loud Mouthed, ""OH HELL NAWWWWWW"" Patty. 15% is cameos from Bill Murray, Ernie Hudson,Dan Aykroyd,Sigourney Weaver and Ozzy Osbourne. 15% is Kate McKinnon's weird remarks which leaves you sitting there debating whether to awkwardly laugh or to sit there and think ""OK....."" The other 10% is lazy unfunny sentences. The acting is appalling. These are talented people and to go and make them do this is just wrong. The CGI reminds me of Grown Ups 2's Deer. This was a movie made to reboot a classic franchise into a more modern era. It just ends up being sloppy and all girl power with no real power.In the words of Comic Book Guy.

1899,emour,Not very good to be honest...,1,26 July 2016,"Where do I start?The main cast's acting was poor. The effects were okay, but the art style was an eye sore. Was not funny, I only ever grinned at Chris Hemsworth (who was the only relatively funny thing about the movie). And don't get me started on the Fall out Boy version of the original theme.The movie fails at both a Ghostbusters movie and a comedy, lacking any original ideas and appearing very similar to the original movie in terms of the events that take place Some examples:One of the main characters (Bill Murray/Kristen Wiig) loses their job They go to an old building (library/mansion) to find a ghost, which jump scares them. They catch a ghost in a public place (hotel/concert), which causes them to gain a lot of attention and people start to take them seriously A black, non-scientist character (Ernie Hudson/Leslie Jones) joins them They get in trouble with the government and as soon as the ghosts start attacking, they are freed and then they save New York.The only reason I give a 2 is for both Chris Hemsworth and Charles Dance, although he only appeared briefly, he is a great actor and should have had a much larger role. The original cast's cameos were decent enough, although they were probably done just to make more fans interested in the movie.The best course of action would be to forget this movie exists, move on and pray that a sequel is not made.",Ghostbusters
1900,IndiegoUnicorn,I think I watched a different movie,10,16 July 2016,"I was very skeptical going in to watch this movie. A good majority of the reviews I read said this movie should be avoided at all costs, but I think I may have watched a totally different movie. I loved it! And I'm going to go see it again! In my opinion, the movie maintained a good balance between, nodding to the original, but being its very own movie. The plot was not reliant of the original, the characters were unique and there were many Easter eggs throughout that didn't make you forget about the original. Growing up with the Ghostbusters, I cherish it and this movie had a lot to live up to! I was not disappointed. I laughed throughout and could not wait to watch it again.",Ghostbusters
1901,steveyhenderson,Who you gonna call? A taxi probably,2,12 July 2016,"OK firstly I just want to say that yes I am a massive fan of the original movies, but this is in no way a 'fanboy over reaction' as some critics have shouted,this has nothing to do with the fact that 4 females play the lead and nor am I a 'Troll'. This is MY genuine review of MY experience of ghostbusters 2016, there will be comparisons to GB84 but what do you expect when you remake a movie?The movie actually starts off OK, within the first 10 - 15 minutes I thought that this could have promise, but that sharp fizzled out. I went into the cinema with low expectations after seeing the trailers, however I was open minded and hopeful after reading an early review. Reviews at this stage are mostly favorable, well I can tell you now in my eyes (and most others) they are wrong.Despite a relatively strong cast on paper with the exception of Melissa McCarthy who plays.. well Melissa McCarthy in every movie. The movie was poorly written, no character development with a villain straight out of Scooby Doo /Beethoven the 8th/ Home alone 57 (Yes that bad) and CGI that rivals it. Kristen Wiig who I have found funny in other movies just didn't seem convincing and her ogling over the 'dumb but hot' secretary was funny at first but grew old, Kate McKinnon was OK, but again probably just over done, Leslie Jones served a purpose as the knowledge of the city, and with the exception of a few bad lines wasn't too bad, but i'd say the acting overall was below par and the comedy was well... not that funny, it seemed like a dress rehearsal, there was no chemistry, it was forced,and seemed as though they hopelessly fishing for laughs to distract from such a mediocre script.The beauty of 1984 GB, is that the comedy was subtle, sharp and relevant. You believed in the characters and they clicked, 2016 had no direction, we had no straight character to bring them all together (such as Egon), it was 4 people fighting for screen time to delivery terrible jokes. Que the 'dumb but hot' secretary - Chris Hemsworth - Who raised the odd smile, but this was overdone too.The villain was ridiculous, the kind of Villain that belongs in the Spy Kids world,completely unconvincing, we knew nothing about him other than he 'didn't like people' and wanted to 'cleanse the earth'. I was looking forward to the odd nod towards the original, but that was overdone, the cameo's for me didn't really work and served no other purpose than to try and appease the fans, it took away any originality that it could have had.When I first seen the CGI in the trailers I actually thought that looked like the best part, but in truth again this is something that was overdone (common pattern), I get that Feig doesn't have experience with CGI and was probably a little overzealous with it.The movie just didn't have the feel good factor of the originals, part of the romance with the conclusions of these was the sense of coming together and almost wartime spirit, which I think in this day & age would have been great, they certainly missed a trick. But instead we had Chris Hemsworth dance us out, which my 4 year old enjoyed but in truth was just as cringe-worthy as the rest of the movie. I've read up how people have said that it is 'Sexist' and possibly 'racist' I didn't get that feel to be honest, certainly no more than other movies I have seen, yes it is probably directed more towards the female audience but that wasn't the issue here. It'll be easy for Feig and Co to hide behind the 'you want it to fail because its women' tag. The problem is that it is just a bad movie, badly directed with a bad script. Kids may like it, fans of the original will hate it and anyone who is a fan of cinema will most likely just be disappointed. I give it a 2 and I think that is being kind.",Ghostbusters

Its really a shame because I like all of the people involve. But what is this movie even trying to be? The original was an action-comedy whit a little bit spooky on the side. All this remake consists of are unfunny jokes, bad chemistry between the cast, a boring plain villain and truly and utterly abysmal cgi. How can the special effects look worse than the original? If you are going to film everything in front of green screen anyway why even bother with real actors? And don't even get me started about the token black girl.

1904,fox-58817,Trappings with no substance,2,11 July 2016,"I had high hopes for this movie after seeing the backlash against an all-female cast making headlines. But hopes don't make up for flat jokes, forced acting performances and a movie that ultimately takes a very unflattering view of its own fans.The original Ghostbusters movies were marvels of dry wit in comedy. The actors were portrayed very much as a bunch of blue-collar bums, out of their element, and trying to make the best of situations in awkward, and often-times hilarious ways. Every gag shot, for example the classic scene in the elevator when Ray's proton pack is switched on for the first time only to see Venkman and Igon shuffle eerily into the corner away from him as the pack whistles to life is the stuff that belly-laughs are made of. It was dry humor, witty and sharp, and it just clicked. It was simple but sophisticated, and done to a tee by masterful actors.This movie by comparison has all the subtle intelligence in its humor of a Saturday morning cartoon strip. The jokes fell so flat in most cases that it was painful. If the original movies were Calvin and Hobbes, GB2016 is Gasoline Alley. The plot is poor and fairly predictable, with many nonsensical decisions by the cast, and in particular the villain, being directed, I felt, more as backlash against the film's Internet haters than made to produce a quality product. I gave the film a shot because I wanted to see what a female cast of talented comedians could bring to the Ghostbusters universe, in what I had hoped would be a piece at least comparable to the originals. From the absolutely terrible script and stale humor to the cartoonish and utterly unintimidating CGI, it failed.Ultimately, the film also failed the one true test of a good movie: When I walked out of the theatre at the end and thought back on the last couple hours of my life, I did not feel like like the ticket or my time had been well spent.

That's just my personal opinion however. My boyfriend who I went to see the film with whispered to me 'this is awful,' half way through and he revealed to me that he had felt ashamed while watching the film. I went because he guaranteed me it was going to be enjoyable and I think it didn't take long until he realised that the movie was a disappointment.",Ghostbusters

Whereas the original Ghostusters is a massive hit/cult classic, this movie manages to destroy everything the original stood for. Gone is the witty humor, instead forced pandering based on modern feminism, gone are the down to earth characters, including Winston who was a personal favorite of mine, just a realistic man who was helping out; replaced by a large loud obnoxious woman who completely destroyed the original character. The CGI looks horrible, in comparison to the original which had a measured affect on cinema and on fans alike.

I will come with some small spoilers just to give some best example including part of ending. ----Spoiler----Why does it happen to be that all guys in this movie are idiots?Mayor, delivery guy, Hemsworth was funny but they make him play idiot.

Also cameos..it is not just with actors but things from previous movies for example words like ""I ain't afraid of no ghosts"" was said by Dan Aykroyd cameo.----Spoiler----Instead of some cheap jokes this movie should have some adult sense of humor. More connection between girls because it was missing. First two parts I was watching 20years ago and I still remember them but this movie will be forgettable. Overall as for me, movie is only worth to watch on TV screen with kids on Sunday morning after Scooby Doo....",Ghostbusters
1911,laurieallport,"Totally of its own, respectful but not dependant.",7,12 July 2016,"Ignore the dull troll remarks. Yes, it differs hugely from the original made some 30 years ago, and yes it does indeed have a predominantly male cast. unapoligetically bold in its difference, whether in its more modern approach to SNL cast treatment, or production design elements - it holds strong narrative parallels to the original, yet embarks on a very different endgame, albeit a lighter tone throughout.It is not a third Ghostbusters movie, nor a rehash which happens to have women in it. Its totally on its own, in a good way. The concept of Ghostbusters and the generations it has inspired as an idea is not owned by us children of the 80's anymore... And this is the product of a different era of comedy (love it or hate it), and a well refined one. I look forward to the sequel.",Ghostbusters

It's a shame it didn't get better reviews.I am so glad that my sister dragged me to watch this movie because i loved it!!! It was hilarious.This is the type of movie that I can definitely watch over and over again and still not get tired of.The women acted really well and had me laughing throughout the movie.Most importantly, the movie captured me right from the beginning. I would recommend this movie to my friends and family for sure.So don't worry and go to the theater for this one, I am certain you won't regret it.",Ghostbusters
1913,espopgo,Ghostbusters Review,4,12 July 2016,"This movie really draws a line in the sand between those that want to see authentic organic movies and those that feel movies ought to adhere to some politically correct agenda. I read some reviews on this site of people who fully admitted to not watching the movie yet gave it ten stars because to them this is a vote for PC and feminism. I'll be honest the movie stunk and I wish I hadn't wasted my time or money but I was one of those folks who felt the need to give it a chance for the sake of fairness. It stunk for many reasons which most of the other reviewers have aptly pointed out. My problem with this movie, which gets to the heart of the whole authentic vs PC problem, is that they wrote the characters to be the female equivalent of the original male characters and it just does not work. You can't force a square to be a circle anymore than you can force a female actresses to behave as if she was a male actor. In an ideal world they would write an original script that brings out the creative talents of the four actresses in this movie because they are actually very talented in their own ways however when it comes to attempting to behave like some bad ass dude they aren't able to pull that off. I would love to see more empowering female led action movies but done in a unique way that doesn't simply rip off all of the traits that male actors have in action movies. There is nothing wrong with portraying realistic female action heroes that acknowledges their biological femininity and play off those strengths.This would be far more refreshing from Hollywood and would require the script doctors to actually earn their pay but I am not holding my breath given the current state of focusing solely on reboots, remakes and endless sequels.",Ghostbusters
1914,juliaconnorsmith,"Ignore the haters, I laughed till my cheeks ached",7,12 July 2016,"I was a bit unsure about seeing this as I loved the original, but I really enjoyed it. it was a silly, fun, funny film. I laughed all the way through and so did most of the people in the cinema. It's not exactly going to win any Oscars but it does what you expect - passes a few hours in pleasant, escapist entertainment. Lots of nods to the original without just being a copy. Cameos from original cast; the main leads were all great.Melissa McCarthy, who I love, was a bit more restrained than normal, and played well off Kristen wieg. Loved Chris Hemsworth as the dumb blonde secretary. Ending was a bit weak but these type of films usually are. Stay for the credits too. Ignore the reviews and go and see it if you enjoy simple fun without looking for any deep meaning.",Ghostbusters
1915,lubeyluceh,It's a female reboot of the original and it does what it says on the tin,10,12 July 2016,"To begin a review for this film with 'I don't hate this film because it's got women in it' is the sexist's equivalent to 'I'm not racist but'. Does this film deserve the 10 stars I'm giving it? Probably not. But does it deserve the barrage of 1 stars it's receiving from hundreds of aggressive men? Absolutely not, so I'll stand by my 10 stars in the hopes of evening the playing field; fight aggressive hatred with aggressive love. The film is funny; it's easy to watch, it's enjoyable, and it's very much in the same vain as the original. It's respectful of the original, and it's nods to it (though overt) are pleasant. None of the original cast needed to appear in the reboot for financial reasons, they had cameos because they wanted to and have faith in it. The pedestal the original movie had been placed upon is excessive and damaging; it was a good and enjoyable film but it was by no means the definitive piece of art it is hailed as by many basement dwellers. It was funny, easy to watch, and enjoyable. Which just so happens to be the same qualities as the reboot possesses. The cast work well, they act well, and they mesh well together. Chris Hemsworth's character is far more naturally funny than I originally thought he would be, and the characterisation of the women, though falling into a variety of well-used tropes, is interesting to watch. If the reboot had the same plot, the same villain, the same special effects, the same writing, and the same director, but four male leads, the vast majority of the poor reviews and insults thrown at the movie would not be present. If you keep obsessively and aggressively telling yourself you don't hate the film because of the female cast then you need to take a step back and recognise that these leading ladies aren't the problem here: you are.",Ghostbusters
1916,optimus-07693,Ghostbusters in name only.,1,12 July 2016,"This film is as bad as people thought it would be. Don't believe the positive reviews that have been bought and paid for.Warning some spoilers ahead.The first Ghostbusters HQ is a Chinese restaurant and they don't get the firehouse until the end. Chris Hemsworth becomes possessed in the film and becomes a villain. There are brief cameos by the original cast but they are not playing their old characters. The whole film is basically a really bad SNL spoof of the original 1984 Ghostbusters. The comedy is forced and not funny. The special effects are a huge disappointment considering how much money was spent on the film. All the talk about feminist man hate is true, which explains why the Ghostbusters are women now. Honestly this film is for feminists and all that support the ""girl power"" movement. The film only uses spoofs of the original Ghostbusters to make a quick buck off people. Save your money this film is a box office dud.",Ghostbusters
1917,spammer-63151,"Another ""Meh"" Summer Movie",4,12 July 2016,"Is it Earth-shattering bad? No, it's nowhere near as bad as everyone thought it would be. However, it's definitely not good either.The first real joke of the movie was a generic fart joke. That's what kind of movie this was. I'll be honest. Chris Hemsworth may have been the funniest character in the movie. which totally disappointed me.The good: It was a lighthearted, goofy, ""something-to-do"" movie. I would not recommend paying to see this at the theater unless you're going with children (and even then, there is too much crude adult humor to be comfortable with that). I did end up liking some of the nods to the original Ghostbusters film, though they did have a LOT of them.The bad: They are really milking the sexism thing - Immediately following a surprisingly cool fight scene, we hear some forced joke about how women are always late. Ugh. They clearly want to continue the dialogue about the casting (any pub is good pub, I suppose).The cast was surprisingly out of sync at the beginning of the movie. There was no real chemistry or flow between the leads. It got better as the movie went on, but it was kind of choppy at first.Did not like how Leslie Jones' character was portrayed. The loud and black one that isn't as smart as everyone else. I'm tired of it, and that type of wacky character wasn't needed at all -especially in this film. I would have preferred one rational person in the group instead...someone the audience could relate to. Overall: It was okay. Like the title says, a mediocre summer movie. I had a couple of chuckles. There were some eye-rolling moments to balance them out. It's something to check out on Netflix one day. In my opinion, it's not worth going to the theater to pay for unless you just want to relax and watch something goofy. I can see how some would like it, but most probably won't.",Ghostbusters
1918,leecalebk,A huge Huge HUGE disappointment,1,13 July 2016,"Like a good movie fan I gave the controversy a very wide berth. Wide eyed and innocently I sat waiting for something fresh and hilarious(kind of like the originals).The first bit was promising, but then it just turned into a sea of derivative pandering cliche's. The humor is awkward, contrived and lacking. Even Melissa mcCarthy(whom I loved in bridesmaids) was a massive let down. This is clearly aimed at fringe feminist elements, and probably not die-hard fans. I felt like I was watching impostors doing a bad impersonation. If Hollywood was trying to make some kind of point they failed miserably. It did not resonate with me, and certainly not with my husband. By the time the inevitable gratuitous shot/ kick/ punch to the jewels had arrived he was cooked and ready to leave. Its a bit like a chef who only eats her/his own cooking, refusing to get any objective opinion.Normally I don't bother writing reviews, but I feel cheated. This was not worth the money we spent. How could they get it so wrong?",Ghostbusters
1919,mansourimike,"If Bridesmaids was the Hangover, this would be the less funny version of Grown Ups",1,13 July 2016,"Non-Spoiler reviewFirst off, I'd just like to get this right out the way: I genuinely believe the majority of positive reviews are by paid shills or bots, as ALMOST ALL OF THEM came the same day in a very narrow time period, some before the movie was even released. And yes, I am being 100% serious, in saying that. When Movies have to have huge profit margins, this should be expected, especially given the unprecedented negative reaction to the trailer. I find it incredibly odd that professional reviewers have rated this movie an average of 6 stars, when the average fan voting barely exceeds 2. Only conclusion I can think of is the reviewers were either bribed or were too afraid of coming off as sexist.Let me also say, that I feel I am a rather open minded viewer, with no real nostalgia to the original GB. I have enjoyed female cast comedies before, and Bridesmaids is one of the dozen or so movies I've actually purchased in the past few years. This is not bridesmaid however. Remember in middle school when everyone in the class had to do a presentation, and the two weird girls who were overly sheltered and for some odd reason loved horses got grouped together and tried WAYYYY to hard to make it funny? This is that same feeling of cringe and secondhand embarrassment, only for nearly two hours.I'm not even going to go into the blatant sexi... err I'm sorry, Feminism Counter-sexism, or the incredibly awkward and played out Racism where the one Asian and one black character are literally walking caricatures, and just stick to some of the laziest stereotypes I have ever seen, but instead focus on the worst part of the movie; It simply was not funny. Cheap and crude laughs are easy and annoying, but they do occasionally at least make you smirk, but I can say with absolute sincerity that this movie did not make me do anything but mildly smile once. The CGI was terrible, most of the actresses genuinely felt embarrassed to be there, and the plot was beyond boring. Look, we all knew what this was, no one expected Casanova or an Oscar winner, but if you're going to be crude, at least own it.It's not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it was certainly one of the most boring and forgettable ones. My only concern is when this movie flops horribly,and it will, that people don't play the sexism card to excuse it and kill the possibility of the next ""bridesmaids"". This was just a bad movie, and no actor, no matter how funny they were, could save it from it's poor writing. Blaming the poor writing on misogamy is lazy.",Ghostbusters
1920,ethanvila,Enjoyable and Funny for all ages,8,13 July 2016,"Ghostbusters(2016) is a very enjoyable movie which both pays homage to the original series in a very successful way, but is also able to develop a whole new universe and entirely new and engaging characters.The 4 new Ghostbusters are all female(which is okay) and are able to connect with each other and this new audience. With all the backlash from this film i still didn't doubt the abilities of Paul Feig as a director. Even know the trailer wasn't hilarious his comedic past in movies like Bridesmaids and Spy couldn't make me doubt the direction this film was going in, even though all the jokes are either hilarious or bland....But still its not as good as the original.",Ghostbusters
1921,gerikerr,This movie has ONE agenda and that is to have fun...,10,24 July 2016,"There is one thing we have to remember, that when we saw the original and thought it was awesome, we were just kids. This is WHY the original went down as a lovable classic and became a small part of our childhoods. Therefore, Ghostbusters is a movie that is aimed primarily at kids but something the adults can laugh at too. Kids seem to make the greatest audiences than so many teens-adults. The reason being is that when kids enter a movie theater, they don't have any hate on their minds wondering if they will see anything political, sexist or even racist stereotyping going on, NO. They go in with ONE AGENDA, and it's one that makes kids seem a lot less childish and hateful than SOME adults seem to be ( SOME meaning not all obviously) . The kids agenda is ( to lay the emphasis ) TO WATCH A FUNNY MOVIE AND HAVE A LAUGH DOING SO! That's it, nothing more, nothing less, just pure fun. My daughter saw the original when she was 5 years old and loved it. Now, 5 years later, she got to see this new version and loved it more. So much that she wants to go and see it again. And she will do. ---------SOME SPOILERS AHEAD------------ There were some laugh out loud moments, when the Ghostbusters were trying out their ghostbusting gadgets and Slimmer hijacked the Ecto 1 and went for a joyride. Along with other gags and jokes, and not to forget Kevin, he was playing the dumb receptionist, he took part on delivering some funny moments. Some may think it was sexist, but please, there have been thousands of women playing similar bimboish roles in so many movies and TV shows, it'done a million times and then someWe females are well used to seeing women play the dumb roles and we don't care, it seems to be the norm. I never once felt the Kevin character was worth complaining about, it was funny. Men have played dumb roles too ( Dumb and Dumber, Stoogies, Mr Bean, PeeWee Herman, Caddyshack etc etc, ) for kicks, because people with a good sense of humour can laugh it off..You'd be a miserable sort if you took it all too thick. With that in mind, I loved Kevin's character, he made us laugh. Besides the laughs this movie came with cameos from all the original's leads I love how they prominently placed a bronze bust of the late Harold Ramis, which can be seen early in the movie and later note that they dedicate this movie to him, I felt was touching. I am glad I ignored the hate and got to see thisIt's worth it.",Ghostbusters

I think if they had instead gotten a bunch of Apes and strapped vacuum cleaners to their backs we would have ended up with a better film. They also managed to shoehorn in really bad relationships.

I forced myself to make it as I'd like to tell everyone: Ghostbusters (2016) is probably the worst movie I have ever seen. I personally felt regret for the time I spent on and felt relief when I saw credits & casts shown on the screen. This movie does not have a story line. Yes, it is comprised of scenes only or I cannot really join them together. Without any experience of previous Ghostbusters, I cannot really understand why writer and director set up the movie in that way. What do they want to tell? or sell? I might be able to force myself to laugh but I cannot as it is not funny at all! Every character looks non-sense and definitely does not belong to this planet. I do not want to touch the racist and sexist parts. Unfortunately, this movie is full of such bad/cold jokes and made me feel uncomfortable as I was paying to watch something like this!",Ghostbusters
1927,beeehaven,Whole family thoroughly enjoyed this admittedly very silly film :-D,8,14 July 2016,"I loved the first Ghostbusters movie. It was the first film I ever saw on a big screen in fact. I'm not a fan of re-makes generally, had it not been for the controversy, I doubt I'd have watched it at all (eg. I'll certainly never watch the remake of The Producers!) but I have a 12 year old daughter and love the fact that she actually gets to see others of her gender getting to be the heroes (representation matters) so we toddled off as a family to go see it in 3d. All three of us thoroughly, wholeheartedly enjoyed it. I'd even go so far as to say I had more fun watching this one than I did the first. The build up to the story was brilliant, with the whole trying to be a 'serious' scientist angle and the tenure on the table if only she can keep up the straight laced, academic behaviour. My partner wasn't too impressed with the cgi with some of it being particularly 'cartoony', though I'd thought that was deliberate. I'm clearly not a proper nerd, so I thought the 3d effects were AWESOME! The ghosts literally screeching out of the film right into our faces on occasion had myself and my daughter almost jumping out of our seats and clinging to each other, the 'vapours' pinging in and out from all angles only served to enhance the experience for us. Him indoors does prefer practical effects 'even when a bit rubbery' though. He still said it didn't detract from the excellent dialogue, interaction between the characters and their comedy timing. Those complaining about 'reverse sexism' (cos yeah - THAT's a thing) should watch one of, I don't know... ALL THE OTHER MOVIES that cater directly to them instead. Yes, a lot of the jokes are at the expense of the sort of screeching man baby that leaves dreadful reviews for films they've not even watched. Yes, the hot himbo secretary does directly parody the dumb blonde female secretary trope, right down to the boss being ickily lecherous over him (he STILL gets some of the best lines), if these clichés weren't so all pervasive in the first place, the parody would've been unnecessary. It's certainly not subtle - but IS brilliant fun. Is it highbrow? No. Is it a great way to laugh your socks off of an evening? For sure, hell yeah!",Ghostbusters
1928,recordinginprogress,About the group itself,3,6 August 2016,"The dynamics between characters in this film is non-existent. Looking back at the original cast, each member of the team had an expressed purpose. Peter (Murray) was the colder member of the group, with Raymond (Aykroyd) being the one with a degree of misguided enthusiasm. These two are made to be counterparts, and between them, there can be some chemistry. Egon (Ramis) does something different as well. He's the smartest of the group, but he's not very capable. He needs the others as much as they need him, because if not, he can't really operate outside of his work. Winston (Hudson) is there to be the most sane out of all of them. Essentially, he's the every-man who needs to be there to ensure the group stays sane. So when you get them all together, hey, you have chemistry and characters. It's almost like you've got a movie or something.This film doesn't have any of that. It doesn't have any of anything. So now we have to match up who's who in this new cast. Well, Patty (Jones) is Winston. I guess Jillian (McKinnon) is Egon? And Peter and Raymond? I don't know, I think they scrapped them. For what, though? Well, for Erin (Wiig) and Abby (McCarthy). Oh, so what's their chemistry? Well, they wrote a book. And? There's no real friction or anything. No real contrast. Abby likes to eat, I guess, and Erin's...there. Okay, so why not just have the Peter and Raymond roles? It was perfectly fine, it didn't need to be replaced with people who are always on the same level. They really innovated the Egon role by making her irrelevant. She invents stuff and she's wacky. Great. What's her character? What are her goals? Does she offer anything to the team besides inventing stuff and sub-par comic relief? I guess not. Oh wait, but Egon knows all the technical stuff. But in this film, everyone in the team (except Patty) already knows all the technical stuff, leading to conversations of techno-babble that aren't funny or useful to anything. It wouldn't be out of character for Erin or Abby to be inventors. It'd probably give them more of a point to the story. So, Jillian doesn't need to be here. This could have been fixed by giving her a character. I think she was only slightly afraid of anything once in one shot in the subway. That's it. Oh, and you know what makes great comedy? Nothing bad ever happening to someone ever.Patty isn't really anything like Winston. Sure, she's the most character-ed character in this film, but she's not like Winston. Winston was level headed, the most charismatic, and was what kept the team ultimately grounded. Patty doesn't do that. Well, that's fine, as long as Patty does something better. What did she do for the team? I dunno. She showed them that ghost in the subway. Nobody in the group does anything for the group.I won't spoil anything, but there are points where the group isn't doing too well, and instead of showing a group dynamic and having chemistry, Abby says two lines about not giving up or whatever, and they just go on. That's not fun or interesting. It's lazy. That's about the best example I can think of. There could be potential with these characters, but I guess someone decided that all they needed was two lines. So what is this movie (in terms of characters)? Is it an improvement on the original? Well, they failed in that department. Is it a remake? I guess not, seeing as they changed so much. Oh, so it's a modification. Yeah, they modified the dynamics to be disjointed. I can't think of any jokes that worked as a team effort. All the jokes were just reliant on whoever was speaking at that time, and they were usually one liners. Just go watch the original. Or any movie that has a better script than this. It's not the death of cinema or anything, but it's still pretty bad.P.S. I feel so sorry for Chris Hemsworth in this.",Ghostbusters
1929,orrstephenm,Ghostbusters (PG-13) - The ladies step up and do a very good job,8,14 July 2016,"There's no denying, Ghostbusters from 1984 is a beloved horror- comedy classic. When we look back on it, the casting of Aykroyd, Murray, Ramis, Hudson, Weaver, Moranis, Potts, and Atherton was golden, and we had never seen such a mix of action, effects and humor at that level before. The sequel was a disappointing follow-up and, despite years of talk and false starts, a third film never came to fruition.When it was first announced that the Ghostbusters franchise was being revived with some of the funniest ladies in show business in the leads, the internet exploded with negativity. The first trailer didn't help much, and many saw no reason to sully their fond memories of the original with a reboot.However, the new Ghostbusters, while familiar in purpose and imagery, is not just a retelling of the first movie. In fact, outside of some of the music, a few fun but unnecessary cameos, and a couple of brief vignettes, this new movie does an admirable job telling a different story and standing on its own merits.When Erin Gilbert (Kristen Wiig) discovers that her tenure at Columbia is threatened by the resurgence of a book on the paranormal she co-wrote years before, she seeks out her former partner Abby Yates (a very PG-rated Melissa McCarthy), who has continued to pursue the paranormal in more practical terms. Teaming with the brilliant but cra-cra Jillian Holtzmann (a hysterical Kate McKimmon), Yates has developing equipment to prove the existence of ghosts and ghoulies.A close encounter at a haunted house and a YouTube video get Erin fired, but provides the motivation needed to create a headquarters where the three (and soon, four) can develop ways to capture and contain ectoplasmic beings. The ladies are joined by Patty Tolan (Leslie Jones), an MTA worker who has her own close encounter, and hire beefcake Kevin (Chris Hemsworth), who is the absolute stupidest receptionist ever depicted on film.The team soon discovers that someone is intentionally drawing out supernatural entities, with an eye towards creating an apocalypse in New York. However, Homeland Security and the mayor's office are already aware that something strange is going on in the neighborhood, and want the Ghostbusters to stop their work before they make things worse. Instead, armed with effective but dangerous weapons, the brave quartet puts their lives on the line to save the city and mankind.Personally, I had a blast with Ghostbusters. I found the sight and verbal gags throughout the film to be extremely fun, in some cases funnier than the original film. I was touched by the quick but sweet callback to Harold Ramis. There were a couple of spots that dragged a little, but not terribly so. Some may feel a bit overwhelmed by the effects in the final third of the films, but I had a good time with them. The cast was great, no argument there, and I would really enjoy seeing a follow-up (they start to lay the groundwork in an after-credits scene, so stick around to the very end.)I feel Ghostbusters does the franchise proud, and give it 4 out of 5. I am looking forward to seeing it again soon.Parents, a few notes for you: Language is mild for a PG-13 film: one use of b**ches, one use of s**t, and I heard a** three times. There is a crude remark about the origin of a bodily sound, and a very brief discussion about a busty ghost logo. There is a scene with about a half-dozen creative ways of shooting the bird. There are about three scary-ish, ""jump"" scenes - the first opens the film and is a notch- up from the library scene in the original. The second is Patty's encounter with a ghost in the subway, and the third involves Abby locking herself in the bathroom when she hears strange noises. The rest of that scene has been shown in trailers and commercials. Considering this director's usual fare, Ghostbusters is almost PG- 13-lite - the original actually had more racy stuff in it.",Ghostbusters

1932,jpolycra,My Thoughts on Ghostbusters 2016,3,14 July 2016,"I want to give my honest thoughts on this film and I feel necessary as this movie has brought out toxicity on both sides of the political spectrum and has similar toxic behavior from Sony and the cast and directors. Honestly this is not a good film and definitely not worthy of a movie going experience, rental if you're interested perhaps but there's an ugliness to this film that is hard to shake. Like other poor movies the first 20 minutes has a promising start then goes down hill. The cast while having their moments feels awkward and not fleshed out, no warmth or likability that the originals are known for. Most characters in this film lack joy or empathy, Leslie Jones is the exception that shines in bringing laughs and being likable. Reflecting on it men and women alike act in really ugly, dumb and mean spirited ways through out the movie. Humor is very hit or miss and my girlfriends hit it on the mark saying it was family guy style comedy. The jokes are constant but not smart or subtle or endearing 1/5 is going to hit. Special effects were a bit silly, proton beams looked great, but over all not selling points just there. The inclusion of a villain was also odd he was not fleshed out, like the effects there to get to A to B. I prefer the originals faceless ancient threat and miss the final 80s fab Gozer. A point for the original orchestral score.I'd say save your money and check out Dory or possibly Pets. Not worth getting upset about but not worth supporting.",Ghostbusters
1933,mercedesmay,ignore the bad reviews,10,14 July 2016,"ghostbusters holy god this movie. please, /please/ ignore the hysteria reviews, this movie is not terrible, and neither is it particularly 'man hating' at all. in fact, the only people I see shitting on the male characters, are the males. personally, I found Kevin fantastic. and this movie was exactly as powerful and feminist as I needed it to be, as many girls, boys, non binaries, everyone needed it to be. I saw many people saying ""the whole cinema was bored to death"", ""the atmosphere was so dull, everyone in the cinema hated it."" - I don't know which cinemas these people were going to, but it wasn't mine. it was positively roaring with laughter, and everyone seemed to have left with a smile and enjoyed themselves, young, and very old people alike. it was funny, it was exciting, it made me, as a young teenage girl feel empowered. I'm sure it made the old man next to me feel empowered as well. and the girls along the row, and the man in the wheelchair at the front, and the children, and the parents. Everyone can look up to these women, these smart, lovely women. they kick ass and they do it well! in my opinion, better than the original (I know lots will disagree, and that's okay.) but we needed this movie. we needed jillian flirting with erin. we needed women who took the spotlight. we needed (more) poc characters, and patty is one of the funniest, badass woman I've seen in a movie like this. this movie is for everyone, and it's amazing. the effects, the music, the atmosphere. it was beautiful. I almost cried a lot of times during, not because it was sad, but because I was so in awe. it's my favourite movie I've seen in 2016 (that was made in 2016) and my favourite film I've ever seen in the cinema. one of my favourites ever. I cannot describe how perfect and amazing it was. but I hope you put aside these pissy crybaby reviews whining about how it wasn't the original and go see it. it wasn't the original, it was better.",Ghostbusters
1934,hollywood-30343,Save your time and money.,1,16 July 2016,"Whats left to tell that hasn't already been said? Not funny. Not entertaining. There are zero redeeming qualities about this film. And it's so disappointing because there were a lot of people looking forward to a properly done sequel. Not this Paul Feig atrocity. Right from the get go, this film is s huge failure. First joke of the film is a queef joke. Really, Sony? That's the best you could come up with? The characters are awkward and don't mesh. And the gaping plot holes only add to the confusion in this abomination. (How can you ""kill"" a ghost that's already dead? And that's just scratching the surface) Go see The Secret Life of Pets or wait a week and see Star Trek. You'll be glad you did.",Ghostbusters
1935,indulekshmi,Great Reboot!,9,14 July 2016,"So I watched this movie on opening day with my husband, as I was really excited to see a Ghostbusters movie with a female cast. I have never watched any of the originals, or the TV shows, so I come to this with fresh eyes.I was not disappointed at all. The characters were funny, the writing was great and the comedic acting top-notch. I posted my views on Facebook and was immediately attacked by fans of the original. Because apparently my views don't count unless I have watched and worshipped the original.I checked IMDb to see the reviews and was astonished to see how badly this movie was rated. I read the reviews to understand why people saw this movie so differently from me, and with a few exceptions, my conclusion is that there is likely a concerted effort to trash this movie online by fanboys and fangirls, maybe because of sexism, maybe because of nostalgia. Who knows. There are people who are praising Chris Hemsworth as the saving grace of this movie, and I simply don't understand why - his character was mostly pointless. There are people who are putting down Kristen Wiig's and Kate McKinnon's comedic skills down. Again, which I don't get, because they are both flawless. Kate McKinnon was fantastic, and I would watch the movie again just for her.So, here's my review. This movie was great, for a Hollywood action blockbuster. This is not an Oscar-worthy movie, but nothing from the Ghostbusters movie was ever going to be Oscar-worthy anyway. But, if you want to watch a fun action movie with strong female leads who kick ass and kill some ghosts with fancy guns, this is the movie for you. This is the Hollywood action movie of the 21st century - with badass women and awesome CGI effects. And male eyecandy thrown in for good measure.",Ghostbusters
1936,libssuckbigcock,Terrible!,1,14 July 2016,"I didn't expect much but thought at least the effects would be good. This movie was a load of man hating, politically correct pandering tripe. The cast is garbage, Kristen Wiig is like cardboard, Melissa McCarthy is a less talented Chris Farley, and Leslie Jones is a 1970s blaxploitation actress. I'm old enough to have seen the originals in the movie theater and this version is a black mark on those two. I pray that that no one dares consider making a sequel. I quite enjoy ghost related programming as well, things like ghost adventures, which makes this film even more of an affront. I can still watch the original, years later over and over. The chemistry of Ramos and Murray cannot be reproduced. The movie is horrible, absolute waste of money.",Ghostbusters
1937,bodieedwards,a good and enjoyable movie,8,15 July 2016,"The new ghostbusters movie was quite enjoyable but it has been getting some very bad reviews and i have noticed that lots of people have been saying that is just a rip-off of the original film but if you stay in the cinema until the credits you will notice that it says 'based of the 1984 film ghostbusters'. this movie had some good humour and an interesting character combination that causes some friction between the team. I also liked how they sneaked in characters from the original including: Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Sigourney Weaver, Ernie Hudson and Annie Potts. there where also a few hints to the original movie such as the original ghostbusters HQ and them getting fired from their first place of work and then going on to a different HQ. there where a few downsides though. firstly in my opinion i would have liked to see them catch a few more ghosts before the big boss fight, end of the world scene at the end. I also would have liked to have seen Kevin fight some ghosts and be more of a part of the team instead of just rocking up in the uniform and then getting possessed. all in all it was a very enjoyable movie that kept me hooked the whole time. i Just think people need to get over the fact that it is a girl team and rate it for the actual movie and story instead of just it not being a male ghostbusters team.",Ghostbusters
1938,baileyslawn,More than what I expected,10,14 July 2016,I was only 5 when the first Ghostbusters came out. I used to dance around and sing the theme song.. the second was good but not as good as the first.. I Agree with Bill Murray on that aspect. After waiting for about 27 years for another Ghostbusters I had almost given up.. and then.. it came.. To any true Ghostbusters fan: this is just an amazing franchise comeback with a hilarious female cast. The audience laughed hysterically as I did and clapped their hands when one of the old characters showed up. I had my doubts however after seeing it tonight I really don't know if they could have done it better. Some critics will get swallowed up in the details but they are just doing their job. The outcome was much more than I expected I loved the new spin-off and it definitely opens up the franchise for possibly another... which is what I was hoping for.. Very well done. MUST SEE!! I want to watch it again...,Ghostbusters
1939,emem-63289,Who You Gonna Call? Kate McKinnon.,8,14 July 2016,"I'm giving this movie an eight, because it promised to be exactly what it was. It was a funny, enjoyable movie. Was it Oscar worthy? No. Will I show it to my children with the same enthusiasm that I'll introduce them to the first one with? No. Did I like it? Yeah. I did. I really liked it. Seeing this movie did not ruin my childhood. I did not feel angry that women were Ghostbusters. I do not think any less of the first movie, because that's not how any of this works! This was a DECENT movie. There were some very funny jokes, and some very funny moments. It was fun. It was entertaining. Patty's character wasn't great, and yeah, some of the jokes fell flat. But seriously name me one movie where you like every single character and joke. Don't go see it if you knew you weren't going to like it in the first place, why waste your money like that, doofus? Also: Kate McKinnon is a GD babe, and I will have that written on my tombstone. Goodnight!",Ghostbusters
1940,tyleracorn,Great movie. Funny and brings the joy of Ghostbusters to a new generation,8,14 July 2016,"I don't usually like remakes but this one was great. It was funny and just the right amount of cheesy and quirky fun to bring Ghostbusters to a new generation! If you expect a serious factual scientific movie... Then why go to something named Ghostbusters? If you want a fun well done remake of an 80's film... Go see this one! I watched the old film first which might have been helpful. The four female leads feel smart, quirky, and played off each other the entire film. Kate McKinnon did a particularly great job. It felt like they gave her a general character profile, maybe a couple of actual lines and let her run with the rest of it using her SNL experience.",Ghostbusters
1941,gwenthehattress,Okay it wasn't bad,10,14 July 2016,"As someone who's a fan of the original Ghostbusters this movie was actually really good. It was surprisingly hilarious and the girls did really well. A lot of people are getting mad because the main male of the story is a stereotype and of course the protagonists are women. Most movies are the other way around. The girl is the stereotype and the guys get to save the world. Most girls don't have Role Models such as these very powerful actresses. The production with the best possible route it could have gone with Chris Hemsworth. You often see movies go the complete opposite. For once a man was hired because of his looks and not a woman. Men seem to get so upset when roles are switched. How do you think women feel on a daily basis? It must be so hard to only have one stereotyped character for your gender. Now you know exactly how women everywhere feel. Now the casting of this movie was genius. There were four completely different women all very powerful actresses and they completely rocked it. Not to mention the different body types of each woman. It's a dream come true for a girl who has only seen over-sexualized women in the role of the hero. Why is everyone getting so upset that women are doing great things? And don't even bring up that mostly men watch stuff like this because there are plenty of girls out there that got over excited to finally see something to represent us. This movie is really wonderful. Is it perfect? No, but it's one of the best movies to come out in a long time. If you don't believe me go look at some of the professional reviews of people who actually watched this movie because some of these reviews looked like some dude pulled stuff from the previews and judged the movie before even watching it. This movie is full of role model worthy women and awesome action so do yourself a favor and watch it!",Ghostbusters
1942,princessitzel-46414,"I don't know about you, but I loved it!",8,14 July 2016,"I don't typically do reviews here on IMDb, but from the way this film is being treated I felt that it was time I did. This is of course a matter of pure opinions, so not everyone is going to agree or be right. However, I really don't understand the hate this movie is getting at all. Right now, it seems people are trying to spam the boards with negative reviews of this film so I know my opinion here will quickly be refuted and dissected. Therefore, I'm going to say what I think needs to be said. I love the originals, they're great cult classics. However, let's be honest, we're allowed to attempt to rekindle and improve on past works. We're not stuck to history only happening one way. And thus I'm glad this is one movie that was rebooted and done. Yes, part of me had mixed feelings about this as most anyone will because change isn't always for the better. But I kept an open-mind and frankly, it was pretty damn hard not to as when women finally got to be Ghostbusters too.I don't know what happened, but clearly I am different from half the others who went to see this movie because I left the movie with the same tingly feelings the originals left me with, that thrilling feeling of ""man I wish I could be a ghostbuster too!"" They kicked butt, they told jokes, and they made it look good. In fact, in my opinion I felt that they improved quite a lot in these films, via the pacing, the jokes, the characters (growth and inclusion), and more. I especially liked the cameos and I also felt the effects did justice to the campy originals without making the ghosts look too surreal (Having recently re-watched them, I really liked the throwbacks to the realistic then cartoon-like throwbacks).One thing I would like to bring up and agree with is that Patty's character was pretty much a mix of racially stereotyped black women, but I have high hopes they will listen and fix that in the second one. Yes, I know, I am hoping here, but I believe it deserves it. To anyone who truly has an open-mind and excitement for a continuation of these classics, I ask you to try to give it a chance, you may love it like I did.",Ghostbusters

I don't think man can realize how strong it is for a nerd woman who love action movies and super powers to see this kind of films. Also I loved how they use the nostalgia wisely and give a lot of great moments for the fans. I saw it on IMAX and the FX and colors were amazing. It is fast, fun, feminist, smart, old and new at same time. Much more than what I was expected. And Kate McKinnon's character is just amazing, unique, smart, fun, weird, and even kind of hot: the whole package. I really enjoy it and I am looking forward for the sequel ;)",Ghostbusters

It's not very plot heavy, but it's a lot of fun. Everyone looks like they enjoyed making the movie as well, the cast had a good chemistry. The pacing of the plot could be a bit better, but the pacing of the jokes makes up for it and helps carry it along. I can't compare it to the original, but if you like stuff like Parks & Rec then you will probably like it. The technobabble got kind of tiring after the first scene. I also really enjoyed the prop and set design. I've started paying a lot of attention to that kind of thing in films and I thought everything looked very fitting.",Ghostbusters

I'm delighted to say, my childhood has not been ruined. Most of these reviews were written before the film was released, therefore, they are admitting piracy or are just making reviews up......the 1000's of user scores entered before the release date are telling as well.

1946,paige-metcalfe,"Absolutely fantastic, don't listen to the whiny men *slight spoilers",9,19 July 2016,"I honestly don't want to believe the amount of c**p this movie has received for the simple fact that it stars women, including a woman of colour, and treats men the same way women have been treated in film for decades. You can't pretend it's anything else. We all saw the same movie. The CGI was on par with films made these days, the acting was well-done, the chemistry between the actors was there and fantastic, the characters were developed to the point they needed to be. Yes, there were faults. A couple plot holes, and there was racist stereotyping of Patty which was unpleasant. That's why I'm not giving it 10/10. But the jokes were fantastic and well-played, and there weren't any of the fat jokes I expected, or anything mocking or playing on the sexuality of the lesbian character. Chris Hemsworth. It often comes down to him on these reviews. His character was dense, idiotic, and there for the eye candy (except not, because he actually plays somewhat of a role later on in the film). If you're going to hate the film for the 'sexism' of his character, just remember that it's the same way women have seen themselves on screen for decades. It's a comedy - a parody in some respects. And his character is also sweet, kind, enthusiastic, and honest. Hemsworth played him perfectly.I can't praise this film enough. After coming out of another recently released film in which I was disgusted at the portrayal of the female characters, this was a breath of fresh air, hilarious, great fun, and an all-round enjoyable film.",Ghostbusters
1947,jtn-95513,Bad or Good?,10,15 July 2016,"OK, I don't leave feed back on movies because I find it stupid to sit at a computer and express my opinion on great art as movies because movies are an art form that is created for entertainment value. So I don't get on message boards and say if I love a movie or if I hate it, I just watch them because I love movies. but now that that's out of the way, I'm going to talk about the new Ghostbusters reboot. Sense I was a little kid I've loved comics and grew up loving comics, one of the huge things I was into as a child was Ghostbusters. Saw both original films and loved them, collected all the toys (still have them) also have the old cartoon on VHS and I still love the Ghostbusters to this day. When I heard this movie was getting made and saw what was being put into it I was upset. I didn't want to see this movie based off of what I was seeing in the trailers and I wanted to boycott it. Well last night my brother & I got tickets after he asked me if I wanted to go, I wasn't going to go at first because I was going to see it later on when it would go out of theaters or to the cheap theater but I went. At first we went to the 3D and it wasn't working at all the 3D format of it was all messed up and wouldn't focus, so my brother & I went to the 8:30pm showing and at this point seeing the first 5- 10min of the movie I was thinking maybe I shouldn't stay for an 8:30pm showing because I have work the next day. Well I stayed and boy am I happy I did. The movie was so funny I laughed out loud on every joke and the throwbacks to the original films were great. I was laughing so hard that I couldn't breath at one point. I had so much fun in this movie that it could possibly be the most fun I had all summer. There were some points that I was clapping and so excited to see the ghost on the screen that I forgot about the Ghostbusters being women. If you are just judging this movie based on the trailers, please don't it deserves a chance for sure and everyone bashing this movie hasn't even given it that chance yet. It's family friendly and it's a blast. I hope that everyone will give the reboot a chance because I did and it was worth it for sure.",Ghostbusters
1948,tarastreetman,Funny and exciting movie,10,15 July 2016,"I loved it. The characters were funny, clever, and well developed. I had fun while watching this movie. I Laughed, and squealed, and clapped. They did not recycle the old story, they paid respect to it while creating something different. And I fell in love with Holzman's character.My only real complaint is the design of the ghosts, the opaqueness and almost clay or fabric look of them didn't say ghost to me, and made the visuals less creepy than it could have been.It's a good movie, with an exciting plot, and the most amazing cast. I really enjoyed it.",Ghostbusters
1949,jessalverson,Best Comedy of the Summer!,9,15 July 2016,"A riotous movie from the very beginning. Supremely well cast and performed, supported by an engaging and HILARIOUS script. The editing does make some interesting choices in the 3rd act that I believe could have been tightened up a bit. I didn't entirely love all of the cameo moments, but the film does a great job of giving a nod to the originals without being anything close to a copycat. That being said, I walked away thoroughly entertained and cannot wait to see it again.For all of the previous Kate McKinnon fans- this movie will change your life.

All the leading ladies are funny and smart and an individual. And there is no competing for men, no catty insulting, no unnecessary romantic subplots. Chris Hemsworth's character is an excellent satire of the ridiculous gender stereotypes prevalent in movies today. The story is decent and well-paced, and the cameos never felt forced (okay maybe Ozzy's a bit weird). The effects are fun and campy, much like the original.

The effects were good, the chemistry of the cast was good, the jokes landed. I loved the movie! I don't think it deserves the thrashing people (mostly men) have been giving it.The only reason I gave it 9/10 instead of 10/10 was that the solution seemed a little too easy.

No. But is it a fun comedy that will make you laugh? YES.",Ghostbusters
1953,sirthinkalot,A bad bad remake,2,15 July 2016,"I have been skeptical of this film pretty much from the moment it was announced. And that the trailers/marketing, that god-awful cover of the theme song, and especially the way the cast and crew painted everybody who dared to say they were skeptical as sexist trolls, didn't do much to dissuade that. So needless to say, going in my expectations were about as low as as possible for a film. The good news is, its not AS terrible as I feared. The bad news is, its still pretty terrible. The biggest problem with Ghostbusters, is that pretty much everything about the movie feels forced. The jokes, the relationships between the four Ghostbusters, the winks and nods to the original, the characterization of the bad guy, the techno babble the big battle sequence at the end. None of it felt genuine. Pretty much everything in the film felt like 'this is a movie, and this is whats supposed to happen in this movie.' There's far too much reliance on zany/wacky humor. There's very few quotable lines. Certainly none that are as memorable as 'tell him about the Twinkie.' Or 'Dogs and cats living together.' I guess if like that style of humor(think Bridesmaids, but less crude), you might like the jokes in this film. But its not my thing. The winks and nods to the original just don't work. They're not subtle enough to be overlooked(like in say, Total Recall), and pull you out from the movie, forcing you to think about the far superior original. I'm not just talking about the cameos(which this film would be much better without), but also the way that certain scenes are almost shot-for-shot identical to scenes in the original. Its a bit of departure from a strict review, but I want to talk about the techno babble in this film. Part of what made the original film so great was that Dan Aykroyd is a true-blue believer in the paranormal, and based the story and script on actual pseudo- scientific theories. The result being that for a film about ghosts, it has a real feel of authenticity. When terms that have their origin in pseudo scientific circles are used in the film, feel like they are legitimate and being used in the proper way. In the remake though, it feels more like Paul Feig put a bunch of 'science-y' sounding words in a hat and drew them out randomly. You know how in Star Trek, the plots are always solved by a series of gibberish that sounds almost, though not quite like actual science? Yea that's pretty much what Ghostbusters sounds like too. It was annoying in Star Trek, but we put up with it for the otherwise interesting plots and characters, and this film is lacking in those departments. So there were good things about this film right? Well yes. Chris Hemsworth was pretty funny as the dopey secretary. Pretty much all of the laughs of the film came from him, and he clearly had a LOT of fun playing the bad guy when his character got possessed. In fact pretty much the entire cast really did seem to be enjoying shooting this film, although in Kate McKinnon 's her hi-jinks came across more annoying than endearing. But still its just a shame that this film wasn't better so you could enjoy it with them. TLDR: Don't see this film. I tried to warn you.",Ghostbusters
1954,MassHysteria10016,Utterly Delightful and Fiercely Charming,9,15 July 2016,"Look, I get it -- when you really love something, it becomes untouchably brilliant. You don't want anyone messing with it. I GET THAT. I grew up on Ghostbusters - loved the movies, the music, the cartoon. When someone stole my Real Ghostbusters lunchbox at school, I was gutted.Having said all that, the negative backlash surrounding the reboot was ridiculous and uncalled for - and as it turns out, all that crying and complaining and cowardly bullying looks sillier than ever now that the movie's out. Turns out that Ghostbusters 2016 is pretty darn good! Is it the 1984 original? No, and (other than a few callbacks and familiar tributes) it doesn't try to be.The premise is the same -- four quirky characters band together to save New York from supernatural mayhem. There are plenty of ghosts, sure, but the true focus of the movie is on the bond that grows between the main characters, and that's a theme that works for both gals and guys. These women watch out for another; they'd do anything for each other, and that friendship is fiercely charming (and surprisingly realistic in a movie about the paranormal!).One of the biggest steps forward from the original is how physically demanding Ghostbusting is in 2016. Remember when the guys puffed up all those stairs in Dana's apartment building? I'm not sure they could've kept up in some of the supernatural tussles the ladies get into.And how great was Holtzmann's effervescent, giddy joy over each new piece of equipment she invented? Actually, how great was Holtzmann herself? Kate McKinnon is the obvious standout in the cast, dancing and deadpanning her way through Holtzmann's droll, off- kilter dialogue. Leslie Jones was fantastic as well - I was relieved to realize her character is more well-rounded than she appeared to be in the trailers - and Melissa McCarthy's excitement about paranormal investigation as Abby was contagious. If I had to name a weak link, I'd go with Kristen Wiig, only because her character starts off as rather brittle and fussy, the straight (wo)man at whom the others fire one-liners. As the movie progresses, though, she has opportunities to show off the comedic talent she's known for.I've read so many claims of sexism, but the only obviously sexist element I spotted was the hiring of Kevin (Chris Hemsworth) as the ladies' derpy, vapid secretary. Hemsworth plays the role with such over-the-top loopiness that the questionable premise (mostly) works, and the whole thing is less a sexist move and more a commentary that turns the more traditional trope of the ditzy female secretary on its head.And the ghosts themselves look amazing for the most part. Most of them are computer- enhanced actors instead of pure CGI, and that distinction shows in their more realistic movement and appearance. I wish we'd gotten to see more of the fantastic effects during the climax (no spoilers, don't worry) - the concept was awesome, but a lot of it played out too quickly to be appreciated.Ghostbusters 2016 is so positive, so giddy, so fun - how ironic that it inspired so much unreasonable hate. Ignore the negative pre-release hype, view the trailers with a huge grain of salt (seriously, Sony - fire everyone involved in the early marketing for this movie!), and give the movie a chance to stand on its own.

When I heard that this movie was going to be made, I was super excited, not only because the movie industry is seriously lacking in female-led movies or because I love Ghostbusters, but because I knew the actors in it and knew they were funny already. Kate McKinnon is a comedic genius, and her abilities translate flawlessly into this movie. I love her character so much, I'm dying to get some merchandise with her on it! I laughed throughout the whole movie, and the special effects were wonderful. I seriously love anything with ghosts in it and I love Kate McKinnon so I love this movie. My dad, a huge fan of the original as well, laughed through the whole thing as well.",Ghostbusters
1958,hughjazz-80277,Terrible hate-filled movie!,1,15 July 2016,"I went to watch this movie with my life partner Dan. Dan is a trans persons and did not want to stay till the end of the movie, because we were so shocked at the blatant racism and misogyny in this movie. The actors and actresses all depicted very stereotypical tropes. I am African American and the way that the black ghostbuster was portrayed, as a dense brute, was disgusting. This is the last movie that I watch from Sony. All of the white female ghostbusters were depicted as having very high levels of intelligence. The only thing that the black ghostbuster was able to contribute was a knowledge of New York and that she had a car. Why not make the black ghostbuster a scientist also? You do know that we are capable of more than just manual labor, right?",Ghostbusters
1959,jbecker-40981,Gratifying for real fans.,8,15 July 2016,"I loved it but I may be biased, the franchise is my favorite of all time, Ghostbusters was the first movie I remember seeing, it was the #1 movie when I was born, had all the toys, the jumpsuit, proton pack etc... And I've been actively waiting since I was 5 for another movie. Not to mention seeing this one a day before release on my birthday in NYC around the corner from the firehouse in 4D. But aside from that and holding the originals in holy regard, I felt fully gratified. Honestly I never understood why that trailer was so hated. It was different and the same, I know that sounds weird but watch it and you'll know. It wasn't as dark or moody as the originals yet in ways it was creepier. It also had a bit of a Real Ghostbusters vibe and it was funny as hell. The casting was excellent. I can see some critics doing the same thing they did with Force Awakens and calling it a copy of the template of the original and it is but I don't find that as a negative, I feel like it would have been more awkward if they tried to shoehorn a direct sequel. For me I can see this being multi-watchable for years just like the first two.",Ghostbusters
1960,cult-88171,It made me feel like a little kid again!,9,15 July 2016,"I loved this film and it made me feel like a little kid again. It's one that needs to be watched in 3D to feel the full effect and the full effects are really something!Being brutally honest, the first time I watched it, I felt like it was a little slow paced to start with but once it got going, it really took off. I also felt like some of the jokes were a little too crude and basic but I was still grinning the whole way through the film. The cast has amazing chemistry and Kate McKinnon really stole the show. I've seen it twice so far since its been out and would go back a third time.This film is radical and revolutionary in so many ways, I almost couldn't believe what I was watching. I don't think this is a film you really want to miss out on seeing, whatever your preconceived notions may be!",Ghostbusters
1961,amidnightrose,I actually saw this movie,10,15 July 2016,"I actually watched this movie. It's obvious many of the reviewers here haven't- they are just hating on it. Many of the reviews were written before the film showed in theaters and that's a shame to hate on it before you even watch it. The Ghostbusters 2016 reboot is hilarious! These women and Chris Hemsworth are a great comedy team. *Spoilers ahead* . . . . .Erin Gilbert, played by Kristen Wiig, and Abby Yates, played by Melissa McCarthy are childhood friends who co-wrote a book about their scientific theories of ghost and the paranormal. Erin didn't want the book published as she was pursuing tenure in an academic career only to find out that Abby published it without her knowledge. The university is not thrilled about the publication and denies Erin tenure. Her confrontation of Abby about the book brings these two women back into each others lives. Along with Abby's coworker and engineer, Jillian Holtzmann played by Kate McKinnon, these three women encounter an actual ghost and through a series of events end up forming their Ghost Busting team. Eventually they are joined by Chris Hemsworth as their secretary named Kevin and by Leslie Jones who plays Patty Tolan. Together Erin, Abby, Jillian, and Patty hunt ghosts and try to figure out why they are appearing in greater frequency while Chris Hemsworth plays their hot but dumb secretary. Together they discover the person behind these apparitions and work together to thwart his plans. That's as much as I want to say without providing too many spoilers. Some people have accused the movie of being man hatting because Kevin is hot but dumb- are men not allowed to be both hot and dumb? They don' hate on this character- Erin has a huge crush on him. This is merely a reversal of a troupe in movies that have hot but dumb female eye candy. This movie has a solid plot. It is hilarious! My daughter and I were cracking up throughout the movie. Many members of the old cast appeared in this movie! It is well worth it to see this movie in 3D. Stay until the very end of the credits because there is an extra scene at the end!",Ghostbusters
1962,thebenjee,"Mildly interesting at times, otherwise terrible",2,15 July 2016,"The story was poorly written, and totally off the feeling of any Ghostbusters movie. Ghostbusters was meant to be a light comedic movie, but in this case it suddenly becomes dark, with a secret plot to purge the world.The scary scenes were terrible, and relied heavily on jump scares, and jump scares are the death of any good movie. Yates is also totally unlikable, being a jerk to the Chinese delivery person over matters of little consequence.The only redeeming qualities are the occasionally interesting action scenes, that kept me paying attention briefly.Overall I am ashamed that I gave $15 to the film's box office, and I would not want to inflict this movie on anyone else.",Ghostbusters
1963,emilyrwebb,A funny feel-good movie that left me ready for a sequel,8,15 July 2016,"I'm really sad that people despise this movie. I thought the characters were interesting, the story cohesive and engaging, and the script funny. I also don't think that the original Ghostbusters is as sacred as people are claiming it was. I laughed, the full theater laughed so much sometimes you couldn't hear the next line, my husband who went into the movie saying ""If I chuckle even five times I'll consider it a success"" laughed the whole time.

1964,zep_google,Glad I saw it; would softly recommend,7,15 July 2016,"Summary: this is not the best comedy I've ever seen, but it's decent. I don't regret spending the money on it and would consider watching a sequel. This is not an intellectual or cinematic masterpiece; it's goofy and knows it. Don't expect an immersive drama and you'll be fine.Pros:+ Good initial setup+ Holtzman (one of the main characters) is fantastic+ Decent humor sprinkled throughout the movie+ Kevin (the receptionist) is brilliantly executedCons:The character Patty is something of a racial stereotypeIndividual characters are relatively uninteresting (for those moments where the movie tries to be anything other than a comedy)A couple of the jokes are puerile rather than funnySpecial effects are okay, but not amazing (though I didn't much care)A note: there seem to be a lot of reviews with complaints about sexual discrimination against men in this movie. There really isn't any to speak of.One comic relief character is a moron, the government officials are inept, and the heroes turn out to have been right all along. I have no idea why anyone would expect anything else from a movie advertised to be light on plot and heavy on humor. There is a single joke with any hint of sexist hostility throughout the movie, and it's a one-liner in the movie's epilogue. As for the four Ghostbusters being women: that should, on balance, happen in one out of every 16 movies featuring four main characters. If anything, it needs to happen more often; we've got some catching up to do.Also, it doesn't matter but I'll mention it here for anyone who thinks it does: this review's author sports his fair share of Y chromosomes.",Ghostbusters
1965,meganjpoirier,An excellent retelling of a classic film for a modern audience,8,15 July 2016,"I loved this film! It was funny and silly, quirky and ridiculous in the best way! I thought it was an excellent retelling of a classic film for a modern audience. Every performance was phenomenal and all the actors' inherent comedy shined through brilliantly (Kate McKinnon's and Leslie Jones's in particular). I've read reviews that complain Kevin was the *ahem* Token Male Character. That he was stupid and stereotypical and that his portrayal was sexist. To that, I ask: would you have said the same thing if the roles were reversed? If the character had been named Kiera and been played by a woman, would you think it was sexist? Would you be upset over the poor and inaccurate representation? Would you be arguing the same points on a woman's behalf? I know it's hard to see yourself represented in such a flat, boring and unflattering way. I know it's a fairly new experience for you, but please, consider for a moment that women see themselves portrayed the same way Kevin is in almost every film they watch, and that this character was meant to point out just how upsetting it is for the sole female lead to be portrayed as a shallow, one- dimensional sex object. That was the point.",Ghostbusters
1966,sblarney-70127,Easily one of the Worst movies in the past 50 years,1,15 July 2016,"My girlfriend wanted to see this, as she likes McCarthy. We both fell asleep somewhere around the midway mark - only to wake up shortly afterward to about another hour of pure torture. The 5 minutes or so I was asleep were easily the best part of the film.I will not give out spoilers, basic story, or any details of the cast. Suffice to say, none of that is worth either my time or your time. If you enjoy taking a roll of cash out of your pocket, then flushing it down the toilet - this is your movie - as that is what you will be doing.Hollywood has been on the downslide for a good decade or more. This certainly puts up no blockade to that momentum. Talentless people top the town, and it's been showing in the product for a long time now.Save your time, save your money.

1967,jellemusoke,Entertaining and Funny,8,15 July 2016,"I really enjoyed this film, however the experience might be different for someone who has seen the original Ghostbusters. It is definitely more of a ""fun"" film than one that stimulates your mind. The story line was engaging and I thought Leslie Jones and Melissa McCarthy were hilarious. This film could encourage younger generations to check out the original Ghostbusters films. On a more political note, I do not think it's possible to consider this film man-hating or sexist towards men without considering most films woman-hating or sexist towards women. Comparing reviews from other films, it seems that some folks are more sensitive to the former than the latter.",Ghostbusters
1968,kbouderdaben,Such an amazing and family-friendly movie,9,15 July 2016,"I went to this movie with only cursory knowledge of the original movies, since my sister and mother were really interested in seeing it. It blew my expectations away - the plot wasn't cheesy and the characters, while a little stereotypical/pigeon-holed, had great chemistry with one another. The secretary (Chris Hemsworth) was certainly easy on the eyes, but he was more than that, and wasn't treated badly by the movie at all.This is something that I feel new fans can definitely love (I'd say old fans, too, because my mother was gushing over cameos, but honestly I can't speak for them - I think it would be fine, but as someone not super-invested in the original movies, I don't speak for old fans). The few adult-themed jokes were light/delicate enough to not be too in-your-face for children, and while there were a few jump scares and the like I think kids would really enjoy the movie.All in all, I do give this a 9/10 because for all that one or two characters were stereotypical, it was a great story and a really funny movie.",Ghostbusters
1969,hilaryadams-02042,A solidly good time for everyone,10,17 July 2016,"I saw this movie the day it came out, and I, my boyfriend, and all hundred or so people in the movie theater laughed our asses off for the whole movie, credit bonuses and all. Kate McKinnon is a treasure, and the entire cast was phenomenal. There wasn't a single dud joke in the entire film. This movie is a wickedly good time, and I fully intend to see it again in theaters. To the men (and it is almost entirely men) who have been complaining about this movie for one reason or another for months before its release, I'd just like to say: the franchise isn't ruined. Women can be comedy action stars, and be them insanely well. Don't believe me? WATCH THE DAMN MOVIE. And seriously, if you think one movie with an all-female primary cast is a death knell for the genre, you should know that for us women, this is the most refreshing change of scenery we've had in decades, with 85% of top-grossing movies featuring male protagonists. So go ahead: buy an absurdly large pickup truck. Carry boulders up a mountain. Drink 30 beers at once, whatever it takes to piece back together your fragile masculinity, because guess what? This is a thing now. Women make up 51% of the world's population and 52% of the movie-going audience. We contributed a full 50% of the total box office revenue in 2014. And we like stuff other than rom-coms (no disrespect to rom-coms).Deal with it.",Ghostbusters
1970,cameronhyattperry,A movie only a child could enjoy.,1,15 July 2016,"*Spoiler alert* The humor was set with the first fart joke and ended with the big bad getting a crotch injury. This is the type of humor for five year old little girls. Not to mention the ""leading"" male is nothing but mentally challenged or lobotomized eye candy, so I'm going to throw in sexist as well. It was just not funny and most certainly not witty.It completely lacks the occult authenticity of the original ghost- busters, instead this new one feels extremely cheap and trick or treat. In all, this is a political film with a agenda, not actual entertainment. You can have a all female cast without being utterly hateful about it or reducing the women to anything, but Sony hasn't figured that out yet.",Ghostbusters

Almost all the original actors make cameos. As critics have said, Kate McKinnon steals the show. You can tell the all the actors are having a blast. It's a little crude but nothing worse than what you see in most comedies. Not sure what all the negative reviews are about. It makes me thinks there's some women hating group organizing their members to flood the comments. Hopefully people aren't that awful, but I guess not surprising.Really though, the movie is fun and well done. It's not Oscar worthy, but totally a great summer flick.",Ghostbusters

It had nods, cameos and parallels which were awesome for fans of the original but it wasn't all inside jokes new viewers wouldn't get.The CGI was a little over the top, but Kate McKinnon was a rock star. Melissa McCarthy's ability to act with her entire body never ceases to amaze me. My roommate and I laughed ourselves to tears and we left the theater in the best mood after a really bad week.

Slap stick humor, bad jokes, ridiculous characters, over the top ghosts and lots, and lots of slime! There are fun nods to the original, cameos that will make you giggle with delight, and even Ozzy makes an appearance. Looking forward to seeing kids dressed up as ghosts and ghost busters this Halloween, so cool a new film is made for the next generation. Brings back great memories for me and will create some fun new ones for the kiddies! All the bad reviews I've seen seem to be from folks who want to take this movie seriously.

Kristen Wiig and Melissa McCarthy a comic gold. I could watch them paint a house. I'm really looking forward to Ghostbusters 2: Man Tears, which I believe is slated to be released in 2018. Gonna be so great. But seriously though, the whole theater was laughing, and while this is a ridiculous premise of a movie, it still entertained and made me laugh. The best part about this movie is that it's going to make a crap load of money and mostly because of the MRM cry babies who drummed up press for it. Once again, their childish behavior has laid the ground work for this movie to become so popular that there will now be a sequel. Nicely done, ya dumb puppets. Haha",Ghostbusters

The movie is sexist as all get out male characters are all portrayed as idiots and a lot of ghosts are killed by shooting them in the balls....The first joke is a vaginal fart joke and that pretty much sets the bar for the rest of the film. The bad guy turns into a cartoon character for crying out loud.The original Ghostbusters was a classic it had great writing chemistry and comedy.

Great cast, well written, impressive cinematography and a brilliant sound track. Even my partner who went in hating the film (from YouTube reviews) found it hilarious and quite enjoyed it. The adult jokes are a nice touch, and not too evident so young children will not pick up on them. There was definitely a sense of girl power so perhaps some of the more negative views may not have enjoyed that. Only reason I can explain them. There is plenty if reference to the past films, so look out for the references!Go watch this film with an open mind. Forget what the internet has brainwashed you to think about it.",Ghostbusters
1978,queenofhaiku,Super fun movie!,10,15 July 2016,"I watched Ghostbusters with my husband on the first day it came out - and we both loved it. It really captured the quirky humor of the original Ghostbusters movie, from 1984 (that I was also able to see in the theater). This new version of Ghostbusters had me laughing the whole time and I would love to watch it again.Those who are familiar with the original version of the movie will be able to pick out several cameos from the original film. It's clear that the original cast approves of this new version.I love that this movie had four fantastic female lead characters who get to use science to catch ghosts and save the world. I would have loved to seen that back in 1984 when it seemed (at least to me) that there weren't any action movies with female characters not only taking the lead roles, but also doing things that are typically reserved for male characters. It makes me smile to know that little girls today will get to watch a version of Ghostbusters that they can see themselves in and relate to in a way that little boys got to back in 1984.",Ghostbusters

It's a modern take on the original with dream-come-true visuals, hardcore action, and lots of fun references to the original movie. It's not perfect, and it's not excellent, but it's fun and refreshing, as long as you watch it with an open mind. What does that mean? Well, if you're a man, in particular, you just have to accept that this movie was not meant for you. It will not, in any way, try to please you or appeal to you, aside from visuals and action. It's very outright about being for women and trying to review this movie with the mindset of simply comparing it to what the original did for you as a movie targeted toward men will ruin the movie for you. It's an open-minded movie that you need to be open-minded to as well. Otherwise, while some parts are a bit awkward, the villain is plain and stock (though is interestingly the only outright sexist character in the movie), it's a fun, cool movie that does a good enough job of taking the universe to the modern age.",Ghostbusters
1980,game_tuck,Gives Cancer Cancer,1,16 July 2016,"Made me want to puke. I love a movie with a strong leading female roles (thinking of Aliens or Kill Bill) but this is absolute crap. This movie has the worst script writing since Trolls 2!!! CGI equally as bad as the newest Scooby Doo movies. No explanation for anything that happens in the movie. Just a dumbed down version of one of the greatest nerd classic movies of the 80's.The biggest kicker was Sony and the director of this movie blamed fans that were being critical of it sexists. Their is sexism all over this movie but not towards women, towards men. Every man portrayed in this movie is ether evil or an idiot. I dare you to find a single example of anything different. You won't find it and I lost count of how many men got shot in the balls in this movie. As if it wasn't funny the first 5 times, they just keep running with it. I want to see another Ghostbusters movie that takes off from the first 2 but this movie is not that and then some! Waste of time and to be honest, was so bad that now I look at Sony in bad light for allowing this garbage to pass for a movie. This Ghostbusters movie couldn't pass as a successful straight to DVD title. A fan made movie done with a 10th of the budget I know would have been far better.",Ghostbusters

Overall though I loved it, I am a huge fan of Melissa so I was a bit biased before hand, but she didn't disappoint!I suspect a large number of the 1 reviews are from people who disliked the film before it even came to cinema, whether because of love for the original or because they are simply sexist, so I wouldn't pay attention to them.

1982,daniel-warburton,Better than Everyone Expected,4,16 July 2016,"Like everyone else I watched the trailer and instantly took a dislike to it. Ghostbusters is one of the most iconic films in the business and it annoyed me slightly that Sony felt they needed a remake of it. So when the went to watch the film, I went in with a fairly closed mind thinking I would really dislike it - however the film was great. Sure there are some very bad cameos from the previous cast but overall I think this is a real gem. I think the overall relationships and dynamics between the characters work remarkably well and the visuals are just as good. Maybe one of its downfalls is that some of the jokes are relatively cheap, and slightly predictable, but there is still enough there to make you laugh. I think this movie will always have negative press because of the instant dislike to the trailer, but it almost seems the worst parts of the movie were included in the trailer! Honestly I cannot recommend that you at least give this movie a try - you might even surprise yourself.",Ghostbusters

I didn't care that the movie had flipped the sexes of the main characters, I honestly don't care, I enjoy movies, specially funny movies. Just shocked by the sexism and how poorly scripted the movie was. So much potential for greatness and they ruined it. The casting was really bad, script bad, effects bad. What was the point of the sexism? Look how sexist the world used to be in the 1940's, how do you like it? Grow up you moron.I couldn't have walked out on the film, watching it with missus, she'd have cracked me one if I asked to leave (even if she thought it was average too), but I couldn't sit through the entire thing on DVD...KEEP WIIG AND MCKINNON, SHITCAN THE OTHER TWO WOMEN FOR FUNNY MEN.",Ghostbusters
1984,jbellingham,A mixed but pleasant summer surprise.,7,16 July 2016,"Ghostbusters begins with a strong start, a tour of Aldridge Mansion leads to a tense and interesting introduction with familiar beats to the library sequence of the original. This sums up the majority of the films pro's and cons. for every great and fun idea the film has, it's held back by it's need to remind us of the previous films.The main cast hold the film up and each come into there own as the new Ghostbusters but out of all of them Kate Mckinnon stands out. Mickinnon plays the role of Jillian Holtzmann, the teams tech expert and weapon quartermaster. She steals every scene with her impressive range of body-language and subtle visual jokes. The best part of the film is a battle sequence near the end of the film where the camera is squarely focused on Holtzmann with the classic Ghostbuster theme playing as if cheering for her.But for every strong moment from the main cast it can't save it from it's villain of the film, Rowan. Compared to more grand villains of the franchise; Gozer and Vigo. Rowan comes off as small scale and lacking in character, even his master-plan lacks originality and intelligence. But while the film falls on it's antagonist, it gains strengths from it's cast, colour and effects. With special mention of Gertrude Aldridge and her wonderful appearance from the basement during the intro sequence.In the end, Ghostbusters builds an OK foundation for a future possible franchise, with a stellar cast, great visuals and some nice jokes.",Ghostbusters
1985,jwilsonfojo,Amazing movie! Go see it now!,10,16 July 2016,"This movie is AMAZING and nothing negative anyone else is saying about it is accurate nor should it dissuade anyone from seeing this movie. I grew up a giant fan of the original movies and the cartoon. I spent many hours of my childhood pretending to be a ghostbuster with neighborhood boys and it always ended the same way, I would ""fail"" somehow to be a good ghostbuster because I was a girl and they would have to capture my ghost while I was forced out of the game. This movie means the world to me. There are things that can be improved certainly, but it is incredible to see an action film where women are heroic, strong, intelligent, and empowered without the help of any men that need to come save them when their ""inherent feminine deficiencies"" manifest. Go see it, see it two or three times, women take your daughters, sons, husbands, parents, cousins, siblings, and buddies. It is fun for everyone I would say 7 yrs old and up. All I found myself thinking was ""This is how boys and men must feel when watching every other action movie that exists, this sense of identity, pride and accomplishment.""

I have been waiting for a 3rd Ghostbusters for over 20 years. I did wonder how the writers were going to pull off women as Ghostbusters, but I went in with an open mind and I must say, they definitely pulled it off. The 4 leading cast were a great combination and they countered each others personality well. It was extremely funny and I enjoyed every minute of the movie. The lead in was great and it just got better from there. Having Chris Hemsworth in it was a good combination. The effects were spectacular and I loved the story line. I will go back and see this again, probably in 3D this time. Recommendation- Stay until the very end of the credits and don't listen to what all these close minded people have said. These people made up their minds before they even saw the movie. Have an open mind and enjoy yourself and you will see the movie for how it really is. Great!",Ghostbusters

This movie has scarred me for life.The producers of this movie are clearly anti-LGBT and against the trans-community. It's 2016. Are you kidding me?

I enjoyed every second watching the movie and the jokes were very funny. The acting was on point and the graphics were awesome! I loved to see women as a heroic character. I felt very proud to be a woman after watching this movie. I felt like this is how a man feels after watching a super hero movie or something.I didn't see any anti-male thingy in it, I really think that those who are nagging about are just butt hurt sexists who can only accept a man to be the super hero. I mean, how many times were a woman portrayed as the dumb one in movies? I'm sorry but Kevin (the male character) did great and this was totally not sexist or anti-male. I mean, there are a lot of hot guys who are a bit dumb, am i right? Although the trailer is a bit less than the movie, I would really recommend this movie. You won't regret it! And as The New York Times said, ""Girls rule. Woman are funny. Get over it!""",Ghostbusters
1989,ajcrowle,A Worthy Companion To The Parent Franchise,8,16 July 2016,"I'd heard rumblings of a potential remake/third Ghostbusters film for a while. Seth Rogen and some of the other usual Apatow suspects were involved. Which I thought was fine, but why bother remaking the film if nothing changes all that much. Personally, I think the video game that came out a few years ago was an equitable solution: you get the original cast and there's a passing of the torch.Flash forward to roughly two years ago when it's announced that Paul Feig would be directing the remake and that the four leads would be women. I've enjoyed Feig's work since Freaks & Geeks and after reading his two memoirs, know he has a deep love and affection for the work of Harold Ramis & Co. Plus there are a lot of hilarious women, many of them are probably in your life if you're lucky enough. I was initially lukewarm on the film after the first trailer came out. But that's typical for Feig's films, they play much better than the trailer's indicate. And as it turns out, the same holds true for Ghostbusters.The film's cast is a murderer's row of hilarious actors and actresses. I was sold from the beginning. Zach Woods has a knack for selling ridiculous lines with a completely straight face.One criticism I've seen is that the film hews too closely to the story beats of the original. It's fair to point out, but I don't think it hurts the film. The Force Awakens roughly did the same thing and more overtly with A New Hope.Feig's films find humor in relationships between characters along with visual gags and slapstick material. There's a lot of joy in watching McKinnon, McCarthy, Wiig, and Stone together. And speaking of McKinnon, this is a star turn for her. Holtzman is a force of nature and steals nearly every scene featuring her. With her shock of wild, curly blonde hair, visually she recalls Egon in The Real Ghostbusters.Chris Hemsworth is great as the Ghostbuster's deeply weird and incompetent secretary, Kevin. And speaking of related parts of the franchise, the film is full of nods and fan service to the original films, from the cameos of the original four in various ways. Even Harold Ramis makes an appearance, as a bust outside of Dr. Erin Gilbert's office. Some of the cameos feel a little forced, but it's nice to see the original cast on screen and passing the torch to a new generation of Ghostbusters. There's a bit of inside baseball in the film when it comes to acknowledging the backlash to it from whiny man-babies who got so in their feelings they made the first trailer the most disliked video on YouTube ever.The film's villain could easily be one of the horde crying, ""Actually, it's about ethics in paranormal investigation.""One criticism I have is pacing, but that's par for the course with Feig/Apatow films. But it doesn't hurt the film overall. It's a deeply funny film with substantive characters and it's a pure joy seeing funny and talented women comedians get to have a swing at sci-fi comedy.Near the end of the film I hoped we might get a sequel even though Ghostbusters II was middling in comparison with the original.The post-credit scene involving the mention of a familiar foe from the franchise made me giddy with anticipation.It will likely be difficult to walk into the theater with an uninformed opinion, given the conversation surround the film, but you'll be in for one of the funniest films of the year and one of the best films this summer.",Ghostbusters
1990,danajunkmail,Low Raters are Allergic to Fun,9,16 July 2016,"In order to appreciate this movie you have to first accept that it is not attempting dry humor, it is not a competition with the original, and it refuses to take itself too seriously. That's the fun and uniqueness of it. The whole tone is light and fun and the costumes, sets, and bright CGI are designed to fit that atmosphere to perfection. I think people are also ignoring that this movie is partially targeted to a young teen audience. There was no swearing, no dirty jokes. Just a really well rounded well designed movie. Kate Mckinnon's comedic timing was incredible. I'm a fan of dark crass humor but it was refreshing to watch a movie with such a pure and unpretentious comedic strategy. I was smiling the whole time.",Ghostbusters
1991,kewimo,The FRESH version has done the FRANCHISE RIGHT!!!,10,16 July 2016,It plays homage to the nostalgia of the original movies. It Also gives a fresh look on the franchise as a movie that actually stands on its own. Some of the original actors make cameos throughout the movie and they all are nicely placed throughout the movie. The HATERS POV are not valid until they actually go see the movie. I SAW it last night and I was reluctant to all the negative fan base reviews. The movie is actually REALLY REALLY GOOD they did the movie and franchise right. It now makes those haters now look like complete idiots. It's actually what you expect out of a summer fun popcorn flick. I like a to go into a summer movie to escape reality for a few hours this movie does exactly what I expect out of a summer movie. Leaving feeling good. The story is well written and the comedy fits well for the movie a lot of sarcastic smart dialogue. So like myself don't go on the negative reviews that were posted before the movie was released to the public. Follow the more current reviews from people who actually went and saw the movie with their own eyes. I highly recommend this movie if you want that fun summer flick to enjoy with your family and friends.,Ghostbusters
1992,diamondminx,I haven't been this giddy after a movie since I was a teenager.,10,16 July 2016,"Disclaimer, I put a vote of 10 on here to combat the one star votes this movie is unfairly getting. Is it a perfect movie? No, but it's damn good.I agree with most of the newspaper reviews I've read, the cast is fantastic, the jokes are hilarious, the action sequence at the end is a little too long and for the last quarter of the movie it felt like they sacrificed comedy in order to have action - but I'm guessing that's a result of studio interference. There was obviously a big comedy bit cut from the film itself when the bad guy makes all the cops and military guys strike a disco pose ... and then nothing happens. Big set up, no follow through at all. (The subsequent scene appears in the credits. Hopefully the directors cut will put it back in)I was not familiar with Kate McKinnon before watching this film, and am now a huge fan. She is by far the breakout star, and I can't wait to see all sorts of little girls dressed up as Holtzmann for Halloween. I left this movie giddy and literally jumping up and down with glee. That doesn't happen very often!",Ghostbusters
1993,jasonryaneightythree,Impressed !!,8,16 July 2016,"Now that I have finally SEEN the movie (unlike most of you wanna be critics) ... it is very good and it is funnier than the original. The original has a more serious approach with comedy sprinkled in, this one is a comedy with serious parts sprinkled in. It was great to see SPOILER ALERT cameos by most of the original casts. RIP 'Egon'. And respect to Rick Moranis which lost his passion to act after losing his wife. Everything you loved about the original, is LITERALLY somewhere in this movie. Make sure you stay through some of the credits. Another cameo, some hilarious dancing, great music. I know it will probably never get a sequel because of the unnecessary hate for it, but I would sure like to see one. I thought each character played their parts very well. My only negatives would be that the 3D was not really worth it except for the ghost vomiting near the beginning. And MORE SLIMER !!",Ghostbusters
1994,pennystarrjr,This carnival ride rocks! Ignore those sad fan boy reviews and see this movie!,9,16 July 2016,"Like any good carnival ride, the minute this was over, I wanted to jump right back on and see it again!The chemistry between the all-female cast is sheer gold—their delivery and ad libs are hilarious. Did it revamp some parts of the original— no more or less so than any remake. It was fun to see the echoes of the original and see a modern spin on them (I am still laughing at the in-joke about renting a former firehouse and the real estate prices in Manhattan!) Special shout out to Kate McKinnon who steals every scene she's in—a mix of Egon AND Tank Girl. And you know what? It made me feel like a kid again, a kid that didn't have smart ass-kicking non-hypersexualized women to make me say ""I wanna be like them!"" But in this movie I was a 10 year old girl who wants to dye and cut and perm her hair like Kate McKinnon and take up electrical engineering.Now, imagine all those little girls who are gonna feel that way.One last note: the villain is a troll who tries to use the excuse HE was bullied for his antisocial behavior. And the nerd-girl Ghostbusters are like ""yeah, so were we"", but they didn't become trolls. And that, kiddos, is some serious sexual politics right there.",Ghostbusters
1995,samurai_foxguy,Ghostbusters ruined my childhood,10,16 July 2016,"But no, seriously. I saw this opening night and had a great time with it. The movie drops references to show love for the originals, with one showing up within the first, like, ten minutes. At the same time, though, this movie is thematically and tonally different. At first, I wasn't sure I liked that, but after thinking about it I've decided I actually really liked that about the movie. The fact is, if Feig had tried to ape Ramis' style, I think it would have come off feeling like a Chinese knock-off. Honestly, it has the director's personal style, and it shines for it.Nothing will ever replace the original for me, but I wouldn't let that stop myself from trying to experience this movie for what it is. Try to release your preconceptions and see how you ultimately feel about it for yourself. You may find that it's a fun movie with surprising turns and familiar feelings. You may find yourself laughing at things you wouldn't have thought to laugh at in the movie. You might just find yourself enjoying it.",Ghostbusters

Turns out - nope. Avoid Arclight Theatres, FYI. I had decent expectations and have never done this before.The comedy is REALLY broad and obvious - kinda like how SNL is now a days. So maybe if that's your thing, you'd be OK. I was literally groaning out loud (one of the reasons I decided it would be better to go). So many of the jokes don't work or are completely obvious. Other elements are beat to death! The Chris Hemsworth dumb secretary bit got to be excruciating. If this was a female character, women's groups would be up in arms.Really not well done. Avoid...",Ghostbusters
1997,hannahlward,Great Captivating Film!,8,16 July 2016,"When i saw that this was ghostbusters i thought of a cheesy remake of the original story line, which, to be honest, is dreadful.However this film is the exact opposite as it gives us a modern and contemporary story line with plenty of humour injected into it. I particularly loved the use of the assistant which really added to the charm of the film. The film only hinted to the outdated originals through the music, car and outfits and still managed to come across as an entirely new and fresh concept. I think it is very creative as they switched the male and female characters of the original and in my opinion made them even more badass! Overall i highly recommend it, especially in cinema or surround sound as it can really make you jump!",Ghostbusters
1998,angelgriffinrs,I can't believe I wasted money to watch this,1,16 July 2016,"I think it would have been more entertaining to set the money on fire.It's my fault though, I went to watch it based solely on the fact that the cast was almost entirely women and thought that maybe there might be a character that I could identify with.The only good character in the whole movie was Kevin Beckham a.k.a. Christ Hemsworth. The character of Patty borders on all-out stereotypical (and rather racist) caricature of African Americans.Please save your money and watch in when it hits Netflix or Hulu or Amazon next year if you just /have/ to watch it as a completing sort of thing.",Ghostbusters
1999,otpos,Ghostbusters Review,9,16 July 2016,"Ghostbusters is a truly hilarious movie that completely lives up to the original, even (heresy) surpassing it. Wiig, McCarthy, McKinnon, and Jones completely sell their characters, and you can tell that they improvised many of their lines of dialogue. In addition, the special effects are wonderful, bringing an updated look at these ghosts while (intentionally) not rendering them truly scary as if in a horror movie. A strong benefit to the film's success is that it is not a carbon copy of the original film- the ghostbusting team is formed in a different way, and the threat they face is different and unique- in fact, the plot is actually better handled this time, with the ghosts actually showing up at this specific time for a reason instead of just random coincidence, and Leslie Jones is not just thrown into the plot for no reason, like Ernie Hudson. McKinnon and Hemsworth (playing a satirical counterpoint to the tokenism of many modern movies) are true standouts in the cast because their characters are so wholly original, but there are many hilarious supporting actors- Charles Dance, Steve Higgins, and Andy Garcia are great as two very different university deans (""You're only here because the last dean went to jail."") and the mayor of New York (""never compare me to the Jaws mayor. NEVER!""). There are some scenes that build a lot of tension and thrilling action scenes, but the best moments are small sequences of dialogue (which the dire trailer did not capitalize on, as in all the other Feig/Dippold projects like ""Spy"" and ""Parks and Recreation"". The cameos from the original stars are humorous as well, with Ernie Hudson and Sigourney Weaver playing brief but bizarre characters. However, no movie is perfect, and a few problems include a few dumb, broad jokes (mostly in the beginning of the film), the underuse of Cecily Strong, and the new theme song (although it is only in the film for a minute, and Ray Parker Jr. dominates both the opening and ending credits). Speaking of these credits, they are jam-packed with bonus scenes and ridiculous bloopers, and make sure you stay until the very end of the movie for an extra surprise. Overall, Ghostbusters rates a solid 9/10 for its cast, dialogue, effects, and original plot line, making sure this is not a childhood-ruining disaster.",Ghostbusters
2000,blumancunian,chill out,8,16 July 2016,"firstly, people just need to chill out. after reading a few of these reviews before i went to watch it, i thought i was going to watch the worst film ever made. i was led to believe that this was unfunny, a rip off, visually poor including the 3D, no chemistry between the actors, man hating etc etc etc. in my opinion, i found none of this to be true. i laughed hard in many parts of the film. i thought Chris Hemsworth was really funny. McCarthy and Wiig were great as always. I genuinely ducked a couple of times at the frame breaking 3D. they gave homage to the original with cameos popping up and a nod to characters from the first one. don't get me wrong, I'm not saying its better than the first one, but i don't think people should be comparing it, they should just enjoy this film as a stand alone piece and enjoy it as its a good film. haters gonna hate, but there's far worse things going on in the world to be getting irate over a film. get over yourselves!!",Ghostbusters
2001,yetreply,An Excellent Surprise,10,16 July 2016,"After hearing nothing but that the movie had bad reviews, I decided to look up these reviews I was hearing so much about. I surprised to note that almost every bad review included something about gender (which really shouldn't be a factor in movie-going experience). So, I decided to go see the movie, ready for it to suck. I was astonished to find myself laughing throughout the movie! Not only were each of the leads well thought out and well rounded, they were all genuinely delightful. This may not be the best comedy of all time, but it is certainly the best movie I've seen in recent years. I highly suggest going to see this movie. Not only to prove our society has moved past the 1940s, but also because it is truly hilarious and action packed.Admittedly, two or three jokes are woman specific, but it is much friendlier to both genders than the original Ghostbusters movies. The male characters in the movie are also well rounded and genuinely funny as well. Seriously, go see this movie. You'll be gasping in fright moments before you are rolling out of your seat in laughter. It was honestly excellent.",Ghostbusters
2002,sparklyflyingpigs,Funny Movie. Butthurt Man-Babies,10,16 July 2016,"I saw this movie today because I watched the trailer and thought it looked so cool. I really didn't understand why people were hating on it, I didn't notice anything looking too bad. I honestly think this movie is getting so much hate due to the overzealous fanboys of the original. Like, hate to break it to y'all but franchises get remade and rebooted all the time and no matter how much whining you all do in YouTube comments it won't stop people from enjoying a funny movie. This movie doesn't try to recreate the original frame-by-frame, instead it gives a new modern twist to the franchise while still paying homage to the original Ghostbusters. The cast was super funny and all had good chemistry. Chris Hemsworth's character was such a clueless little puppy dog--which apparently makes some people mad for portraying a man as stupid and clueless as if they haven't been doing that to women for years.The final fight scenes throughout New York were totally awesome and showed women as friends kicking ghost ass. Totally a fun and enjoyable movie and I hope all the stupid hate won't stop you from watching it.",Ghostbusters
2003,purplepiper-98408,Please have several seats,10,16 July 2016,"Look. I understand that this movie has legitimate criticism, but I am not going to focus on that in my review, as there is something much more important I need to discuss.I understand all the pain Chris Hemsworth's character is causing everyone on this review site. After all, no one deserves to see the only person of their gender represented as a vapid, idiotic, useless piece of eye candy. No one deserves to sit and watch as they are told that they are only good as a sexy side character in an action movie.Oh. Wait. Hmmmm... Hey has anyone seen how the female characters are treated in the original ghost busters? And, uh... almost every other sci-fi action movie? No?Anyway, here's what I wanted to say. Please, please, please, let us have Ghostbusters. I'm already aware that some dudes are giving this movie negative reviews without actually seeing the movie out of spite. We NEED more movies like this that positively depict women as characters that get stuff done without having to look attractive. These are the characters our daughters need to watch. No matter how conscious of social issues you think you are, most white men will not understand how important it is to see yourselves represented in the media. So I ask you to not scream and cry about one of your favorite movies being rebooted for a different audience. All due respect, your childhood is over. You can go back and watch the ""ruined"" old ghost busters any time. What you're forgetting is that there are childhoods still happening right now. (I KNOW shocking, right?) I find it important that our girls and our boys grow up seeing that girls can get it done. I WISH this was around when I was younger to show me that YES, I can do whatever I want to do. And this is important because most of the time, the media is already telling this to the boys. If you can't recognize this, please look up ""privilege""My 11-year-old brother and my father both adored this movie, and both of them are big fans of the original. And guess what? They both had legitimate criticism, as did I. But they understood that Chris Hemsworth's character was poking fun at the way women are typically treated in film. If an 11-year-old can get the joke and understands why it was in the movie, and you can't, please have several seats.PS look at this picture at the premiere and tell me again that this movie was a waste of time. https://www.buzzfeed.com/davidmack/kristen- wiig-ghostbusters",Ghostbusters
2004,eduardopmolina,Horrible Movie,2,16 July 2016,I thought this movie was horrible. I am a huge fan of the original movie and this was pure manure! Kids that enjoy special effects might like it but what a POS movie. Very disappointed in how they could have ruined a franchise like this. You have to be an idiot to not have taken advantage of this. Also why all women for this??? Does not make sense. The move starts out OK and then had a few surprises but I was waiting for it to get better. It did not happen and much of the effects really nothing revolutionary. The story-line is not good. The humor had some good lines and really not ha ha funny. Just try to avoid paying for this and wait until it comes out on video.,Ghostbusters

And we really enjoyed it lots of laughs some good scares and awesome cameos. The actors were all fun with Chris really hamming it up, Kate Mckinnon is brilliant as the crazy but brilliant scientist she gave me some great laughs. The others all did a likewise good job each one created a quirky and likable character. I definitely recommend this movie as fun light entertainment and a bit of a nostalgia fest, do stay through the credits too if you want to see some more cute Chris Hemsworth.

I know people are trying to say this film is awful but that simply isn't true--or those people have terrible taste. Definitely see this movie and take your kids to see this movie! It is amazing fun and promotes women as heroes, a stance we sorely need. If you're looking for a fun summer movie that has enough energy to hold your attention for a few hours, and make you feel exhilarated afterwards, you've come to the right place.

Hypocrisy is an ugly thing.I'll take my films without a dose of gender politics, thanks. I'd like to be positive and say that I was pleasantly surprised by this, but I just cannot bring myself to do it. The jokes were pretty much stolen from other films, the story line was both a rip off from the first and also laden with internal contradictions. For example, do the proton beams just capture ghosts or ""kill"" them? The male comedy relief was a mix of stereotypes that so called progressives have been fighting against for years.

2009,pureheartbear,The New Ghostbusters is a Gutbuster!,10,16 July 2016,"Please don't listen to the fanboy hate about this movie. The only thing that it will do is keep you from seeing such a wonderful, funny movie. The new Ghostbusters was everything and more of what I expected and come to love of the Ghostbusters. First off, it was hilarious like to the point I had to stop myself from laughing and it wasn't easy. I laughed so much that my eye's started to blur from the tearing up. There were so many gut busting moments that I couldn't help but crack up. Leslie for me stole the show with her bold personality. I kept wanting to see more scenes were her in it. Kate was also hilarious. All four of the ladies were strong in their own ways and they worked very well together. There was a lot of chemistry.The graphics and ghosts were amazing. I definitely recommend seeing it in IMAX 3D if you can. I really felt fully submerged into the Ghostbuster world. There were times that I was actually scared by the ghosts and jumped out of my seat. I don't ever remember getting scared in the first two. There were a lot of fun references to the first two and really did a great job of honoring the legacy. I loved all the cameos by the original cast. Sigourney Weaver was my favorite by far! Dan Aykroyd was pretty funny as well.I loved this version so much that I'm going back to the theater to see it again this week. Like I left the theater wanting more. Also stay until the end of the credits, trust me on that one. I really hope they make more as I love a world where all four leads are four intelligent, strong, bad-ass women!!! It will open the doors for so many girls and women alike, who might not have normally been brought in. Who am I going to call? Kristen, Melissa, Kate and Leslie!!! That's for sure!!! I give it five ghosts out of five!!! I really hope that it does well enough to make more with these four fantastic ladies!!!",Ghostbusters
2010,briannacsheldon,Loved it!,10,16 July 2016,"First off: I straight up loved this movie. I enjoyed it so much that I cried starting in the last ten minutes and didn't stop until after the credits. That's how much I liked it. So be forewarned.I really enjoyed a lot of things about the movie: the effects were pretty good, the dialogue was pretty snappy in general, I laughed a lot (and yes, a lot of it is ""low brow"" humor, but whatever), and it was fun overall. There were a couple things that really stood out for me.I have never seen a movie with geeky, intelligent, conventionally attractive and ""not conventionally attractive,"" dorky women of so many different body types and personalities. I haven't. Maybe I'm missing something? But this movie has geeky women - about different things! Tech! Ghosts! History! - being both effective and able to fail, being dorky (oh, gosh, sometimes so awkward), being feminine AND somewhat masculine AND disregarding both, being straight and awkward about it, being very obviously queer (no, the lines stating that one of the characters is gay aren't in the movie, but it's demonstrated well in the film without interfering with the plot in a non-romance film, which I thought was great!), being kind of ambivalent in sexual context (possibly asexual!), being strong physically, being weak physically, being book smart, being street smart, being academic, being working class - they were REAL. HUMAN. WOMEN. I can't say that enough. I can't.This movie was a movie about women and about women's friendships. There were a couple of different friendships represented - one was a long-term teenage friendship with a falling out, one was a working relationship that was also a really strong friendship, one was a newer friendship that was very quickly a ""I'd die for you!"" friendship, and there were other arrangements within that. It was amazing and beautiful. I never saw Bridesmaids (not so much my crowd), and while I enjoyed Heat, it was a much simpler film in regards to relationships. This film had some conflict, but it wasn't that awful entertainment-ruining conflict for me, and it made the characters seem real, and seeing women's friendships in a non- ""women's film"" context was really cool.The women were unapologetic dorks and geeks. You know those like, ""cool tech techno babble"" moments that like, every sci-fi film or show has, where everyone crowds around a table to look at stuff? THIS. HAD. THAT. BUT. IT. WAS. WOMEN. and I just couldn't stop squealing and being so freaking excited. And like, the women used jargon and confused people with their intelligence and knew things other people didn't know and were silly but still were SMART and GOOD AT THEIR JOBS and SHOWED ENTHUSIASM and YES. The villain was so appropriate. I won't go into details here. They were just so perfect for the context of the film internally and externally, and it really just felt so right. A+ on the film writers and creators. Just, yes.Men were secondary. I love men, I really do. But men have a lot of their own films! A LOT. So I was like, oh, we'll have more men heroes. But wow, the men came out on the rough end here. Men were shown for the superficial issues we often see, but some of the toxic parts of masculinity and men's behavior was highlighted, too. That was really cool to me, because it felt like a reversal of the norm. And even though the guys were kind of idiots, the women didn't treat them awful the whole time. They may not have respected them and been frustrated with them, but they didn't dehumanize them. Which, you know, was kind of a deviation from that reversal.Callbacks were cool, but weren't needed. The film had a number of callbacks to the original films, which were great! I've seen the originals, but I'm not a huge fan. The callbacks were cute, and I recognized them, but they also served a GREAT role in explaining why this movie was good, approved by its predecessors, and how the movie didn't really need validation at all because it was just a great movie. I felt like I was a part of it. Ghostbusters was such a boy's club when I was growing up. I watched the films young, and even then I had issues with the content and was pretty unenthusiastic about it. I mean, I saw them before I was 10 and the main characters were like, 40 year old sexist men. Like... not my thing. But this? This movie was made for people like me. Not to the exclusion of others, no, but it made me feel so welcome. Finally, something I had grown up alienated from was for me and I could know that.There are some moments that made my heart swell. There were plenty of silly things, plenty of goofy things, laughs, groans, cheering for cool action bits (Seriously, Holtzmann's scene near the end HOLY MAN)... but there were a few lines that were about like, friendship, and acceptance, and it was so good. I really loved it. I will probably see it again in the theater, & I'm definitely buying it when it's out. I won't ""recommend"" because I know there will always be people who come back complaining that I didn't warn them it was ""stupid"" or ""immature"" because it had some toilet humor (cuz it's okay if Puck does it but not a woman) or because it had slapstick or something. I can't get hung up on that right now, so I'm just gonna say: I loved it, it made me happy, it made me feel welcome and included, and it made me laugh so hard I cried. ﻿",Ghostbusters

2012,poke_k,Better than many are claiming,8,16 July 2016,"Personally, I loved the movie. Female characters were hard to come by in action movies, and usually take a role resembling the role of Kevin, the receptionist- a dumb blond that exists as eye-candy- and it was refreshing to see four female comedians as the protagonists in the movie. While I would love an original movie like this, the reboot was still awesome.One of the biggest complaints I see is that this movie is 'sexist', mostly posted by men, which is honestly laughable. As someone who has studied systems of oppression and societal power dynamics, hearing men call a movie sexist towards them because there were few male characters is just funny. While I'm a feminist, I'm not a radical feminist, as the naysayers are saying most people who support the film are.When I went to see Ghostbusters, almost every seat was filled, and about half the audience clapped when it was over. Despite claims of poorly executed humor, most of the audience at my showing clearly enjoyed it and the theater was filled with laughter.As a woman, watching four strong, intelligent women being the heroes of the movie was so refreshing. While I do love action and superhero movies, I've been longing for one with female leads and Ghostbusters finally gave that to me and others who've been hoping for the same.",Ghostbusters
2013,ajodasso,Stellar (or: Don't Listen to the Butt-Hurt Dudebros),10,16 July 2016,"This is the most refreshingly original, yet lovingly-referential-to-its-predecessor reboot of a cult classic that I've ever seen. It has enough verve and fresh humor to stand on its own merit, yet just enough original-cast cameos and satisfyingly clever nods to the 1984 version to ensure that it's on point.If the almost complete lack of male gaze in this film is what's gotten almost every previous reviewer's panties in a twist, then I'm laughing all the way to the end of this write-up. They've all proved just how successfully this film has achieved its aims. When your four female protagonists are, in no particular order, a queer neuroatypical scientist-slash-engineer, a confidently nerdy local-history buff of color, and a pair of academics who, in addition to having faced bullies together in their teenage years, also continue to face workplace bullying for both gender and research-interest reasons, the bottom line is that it's stellar representation. When you add to this the fact that their character development and interactions with each other are not only cleverly and sensitively written, but also downright hilarious, I absolutely fail to see how this film could be counted as a failure.There's been a real dearth of truly fun, worthwhile, and socially relevant summer blockbusters in recent years. This remake is a breath of fresh air and (as the majority of the user reviews on this page amply demonstrate) a rollicking, status-quo-challenging kick in the pants for those who indisputably need it.",Ghostbusters
2014,dark_bard,Wow. Lots of haters up in here.,7,16 July 2016,"Look, it's pretty simple. This is a stupid comedy remake of a stupid comedy from the 80s. Anybody trying to uphold the original Ghostbusters as some sort of untouchable masterpiece is trolling. That was a movie that had a female ghost sucking off Bill Murray, FFS. Anyone who goes into this film expecting Shakespeare or Schindler's List is going to be disappointed. Were there issues? Absolutely. And I can sit here and list them all, I'm sure. But here's the deal. At the end of the movie, when I walked out of that theater, I walked out with a grin on my face. I spent $10 and two hours of my time, and I was smiling at the end of it. And that's really what a summer comedy is about. People in my theater--which was about half full on a Saturday night around 8pm start time--laughed at the jokes, and there were a lot of people walking out saying, ""man, I'm surprised at how fun that was.""All the cameos were great, and it was apparent that EVERYONE involved had a great time making this movie (especially Chris Hemsworth, man he was obviously hamming it up every chance he could, and loving it). It was meant to be light-hearted fun, and that's what it was. I thought the four main actresses killed it together. There were enough hat-tips to the original to satisfy all of us 80s kids, but not enough to get old. The villain could have been better fleshed out, if anything I thought he was the weakest link in the movie. Predictable as all get-out. If they do another one, I hope Feig & Co. feel they can take more chances with the next one. My husband, who was originally quite MEH about the prospect of going to see this because he doesn't care for the SNL actresses, said, and I quote, ""This is how you remake an 80s classic."" He walked out of the theater grinning as well, and very pleased. I can't give this movie a 10 because it wasn't perfection. But it was a solid 7. Solid comedy outing from Feig & Co. Would see again.",Ghostbusters
2015,lord_jigg,A Whole Lot Better Than People Are Making it Out to Be!,8,16 July 2016,"This movie was well done, and had great cameos throughout it. The only real complain I had was that the ghosts looked ""too pretty"" due to the cgi. Other than that, I really enjoyed the movie. You have to stay through all of the credits to take everything in (hope that's not a spoiler!). I know people complained about the lack of chemistry between characters, and I think that that was intentional as there were tensions and not everyone truly knowing each other. I think we will see them more cohesive as a group in the second movie.Did it have its silly moments? Sure! Where they THAT bad? Not at all! Nothing will ever beat the original, but this is a solid modern Ghostbusters.",Ghostbusters

I was so surprised that movie has nothing to complain.Casts are well chosen, script is fun. My son 8 years old love it so bad, I hope they do the 2nd one. Such a shame when people judge thing before they watch. Good family movie, not too scary and also not rude.sorry for my English, English is my second language.I expect that movie will be not well made but surprise me, it was fun. Thank you for made this movie. I love all those girls and I think Kevin is cute character. My family is absolutely love it!",Ghostbusters
2017,ozma-14959,"A lot of fun, it felt like the Ghostbusters to me.",8,17 July 2016,"I really like the Ghostbusters franchise. And I don't mean that like some people, who mean they loved it when they were little and still love the movie now as they look back on it through the rosy tint of nostalgia. I cannot be like that; I didn't see Ghostbusters until I was a teenager, and I did not love the film until I was a young adult. However, once I click with a story, I never let it go and tend to pursue it beyond its most famous and mainstream component. In this case that involved watching ""Ghostbusters 2,"" playing ""Ghostbusters: The Video Game,"" watching all of ""The Real Ghostbusters"" and ""Extreme Ghostbusters,"" and reading every single one of the IDW comics from ""The Other Side"" all the way to the most recent issue of ""Ghostbusters International."" Oh, and I also have a pair of Ecto Goggles which I clip onto my pistol belt and wear with a Ghostbuster zip-up shirt I made with a name badge, no-ghost patch on the right sleeve, pocket on the left sleeve, and velcro fasteners on the cuffs. Those are my credentials, that's the kind of person I am. So the big question is, ""What did I think of this reboot?"" This remake of Ghostbusters made me laugh a lot, and I liked the characters. While one of the main characters is clearly drawn to Chris Hemsworth's character Kevin, she is not persistently/creepily perusing him in the same way that Venkman does to Dana in the 1984 film. In fact, she actually keeps enough possession of her sanity to not be mindlessly blown away by his muscles and good looks and instead suggests they not hire him because he would clearly be a horrible secretary. Setting her attraction aside, the movie did not have a romantic subplot, and I think that is fantastic. We got a bit of backstory for a few of the characters, which is more than we can say for the original Ghostbusters film. And despite the trailers' best efforts to convince everyone that Patty was a certain overused character type, I was able to enjoy the character as she actually is in the movie, where she is quite the history buff and actually seems pretty laid-back a lot of the time. The ghosts felt much more dangerous than they did in the original two Ghostbusters films. For the first time I really felt like this was a potentially lethal line of work *before* we got to the the main enemy at the end of the movie. Some of the ghostbusting sequences were very cool, maybe too cool if you want this movie to be just like the one from 1984, but I think the sillier moments help to balance that out. (There are some situations only Ghostbuster type action heroes find themselves in because all the uber-cool heroes like James Bond somehow manage to avoid being smushed by gigantic parade balloons and the like.) There were new weapons for the Ghostbusters to use against the ghosts in this film, but I was surprised to find I was okay with that. I suspect this is because I have become accustomed to similar versions of several of them in the fantastic IDW comics continuing the adventures of the original Ghostbusters. (In the comics, Egon invents similar grenades and modifies several of the proton packs to include pistol-style firing mechanisms.) If I have one complaint, it is that I do not think the technobabble was as good in this film as it was in the 80's movies.This movie may contain the most entertaining credits I've ever seen, and there was an easter egg waiting for fans of the original movie at the very end. When the lights came on, my first thought was, ""I hope they make a sequel,"" which may make me a terrible person in the eyes of some, but I don't get my opinions secondhand from the ""cool"" people, I try to think for myself.",Ghostbusters
2018,zetakappasocialmedia,All the boys are mad and the movie rocked it.,10,17 July 2016,"Seriously all of these man babies are having breakdowns about what a man hating mess this was. And yet there was not a moment of man hating in the entire movie. If you are saying that the only reason this was man hating is because all of the main stars were female and one male actor brought on because they are attractive then the reverse must be true. Making over 90% of all block buster hits women hating. Yet these activists who are crying out for equality don't care when it is the women being overly sexualized. This movie was hilarious and had perfect timing with all of the jokes. It kept the same styling with the modern cgi twist and the star cameos were the cherry on top. Don't listen to all of these men throwing fits, give this phenomenal movie a shot and you won't regret it.",Ghostbusters
2019,richkirtland,Definitely worth watching!,8,17 July 2016,"Let's start off by saying that I'm one of the original GB generation and so was surprised that the reboot of this classic would have 4 women replacing the all-male cast. I believe that a number of men of a similar vintage across the globe were not only surprised but also angered by this, which it seems has fueled a surge of hate-posting on various forums and movie review websites. Clearly, this is nothing more than misogynistic madness aimed at discrediting the movie before it even hit the screens. Considering that this movie is produced by Dan Akroyd and stars a number of the original cast in support, it is rather paradoxical that in attempting to keep the original version sacrosanct these haters have probably offended the very men who brought them this movie in the first place!Anyhow, I am pleased to report that this movie is GREAT -- go and see it!

If there was a personification of this movie it would be a large amount of fecal matter. Truly, society as a whole has sunken to a new low with this one. Somewhere on the line of making this atrocity, someone somewhere should have put a stop to this unforgivable sin against all mankind. If there is truly any justice in the world this movie will be a flop and it will be a warning to never make such an unwarranted reboot ever again. Help the souls of the men and women who helped make this movie as they will probably burn for all eternity for their transgressions against mankind.

This is a very fun movie and totally worth the money and time to see it. In fact, when I saw the IMDb score on Friday, that was intimidating. Some haters just gave the lowest score for whatever reasons. Many of them I bet they did not even go to see the movie! Yesterday, I read a very positive comment and it mentioned on a famous website some people were irritated by Ghostbusters and call others to bully the movie. Unfortunately, it worked and reflected the very low score on IMDb. That was why I missed this movie until today I decided to find out on my own rather than the comments on the internet. And it turned out a very nice movie. Thanks to more and more people actually went to see this movie and gave positive feedback, and that is why Ghostbusters' IMDb score is slowly but steadily rising now(from 3.6 to 4.8 now). All I can give is that Ghostbusters is tons of fun. The story might be a bit flat but it surely is hilarious. Don't let haters influence your judgment.

2022,kitty-07902,A Fun Summer Movie Worthy of the Franchise,10,17 July 2016,"Amazing movie, absolutely hilarious, I was crying by the end of it. Plot wise, I found it much more interesting than the old one. The characters were amazing and the villain an interesting take in the world of cut-and- paste villains. Jillian Holtzmann was amazing, stealing the show with everything she did. Erin, Patty, Abby, and Kevin were all hilarious and all the characters were given area to grow. The pacing was slightly off, though that was due to the original cut being 4 hours, many crucial scenes for pacing were cut because of the time limit. Thats the only real concern I have for the movie except for one scene of cgi, though the cgi throughout was very good. The cameos and nods to the original were fun and thought out, with Annie Potts being my favourite. Pay no attention to the hate its getting. Yes, it has some problems, but this is still a fun movie for the summer worthy of the franchise.",Ghostbusters
2023,jstrauss-34407,"One of the Most Original, Successful Reboots of All Time. Yes, really.",9,17 July 2016,"I have been a Ghostbusters fan since I was 4. I just threw an elaborate themed party, spending exorbitant amounts of money acquiring Ecto Cooler, Limited Edition Twinkies, and even a sticker book never printed in America. I am a lifer, and I went into my showing VERY cautiously optimistic after several bad trailers and TV spots did the film no justice. But you know the pain of having seen all a movie's best moments in the trailer? GB 2016 is the exact opposite of this all too common problem. It is original enough to justify revisiting the franchise, but so jam-packed with reverence and references to the original, it almost feels less like a reboot and more like a tribute. Exciting, visually dazzling, and comedically sly, this film is almost perfect, and QUITE possibly the strongest film in the series, as blasphemous as that may sound. Go see for yourself. Yes, really.",Ghostbusters
2024,lilyford,Why the low ratings?,8,17 July 2016,"I'm going to be seriously honest: part of the reason for low ratings on this film is almost certainly modern day sexism. 'Man-hating'? Why are you trying to excuse the male- dominance of lead characters in films by making these women take the blame for a film 'dead on arrival'?My advice, to anyone who wishes to watch this film with with an open mind, would be to watch 'Ghostbusters' as a standalone film. Don't compare it to the previous Ghostbuster movies and don't think of it as a sequel: it's a reboot! A funny, modern and awesomely feel-good reboot.Anyone who wants to give this movie a rating of 1 or 2 must be so boring. It's just a bit of fun and entertainment and cameos from Bill Murray, Ernie Hudson and Sigoruney Weaver pay humorous yet subtle homage to the original franchise.Kristen Wiig, Melissa McCarthy, Kate McKinnon, Leslie Jones and Chris Hemsworth all have brilliant comedic timing.

For one thing, this is a campy movie and comedy, and for another thing, GO WATCH THE ORIGINAL. Tell me how that looks, then come talk to me. I loved the pacing for the most part, though emotional moments did kind of fall flat. The movie was too funny to let that drag it down, though. I actually don't think that Chris Hemsworth was just eye candy, his part as Kevin was very entertaining.

2026,lukafoster,i've seen this film twice and i would see it again it's that good,10,17 July 2016,"honestly, this is one of the best remakes i've seen! though considering jurassic world that's not a difficult list to top. irregardless, this film was so much better than i expected! the characters all have wonderful chemistry and friendships, the jokes are genuinely hilarious and just as character-driven as the original ghostbusters. the effects look great and man, those visuals... such great cinematography! and not to mention the soundtrack! i would recommend this film just for the soundtrack, to be quite honest.the film definitely holds up just as well the second time; i laughed just as much at the jokes. however, there were a few scenes and lines that probably weren't really needed and could have been switched with one of the deleted scenes. but aside from that, i really have no complaints.so feel free to take this review from a person who actually watched the film multiple times, rather than most of the reviews of this film that have been written by sad misogynistic MRAs who haven't even seen the film and are offended that for once men aren't front and centre, as an indication that this is a fantastic film you should DEFINITELY add to your watch list.an overall enjoyable experience!! i totally recommend this film to everyone",Ghostbusters

The four leads (yes, they're all women - oh, no!) are phenomenal, especially Kate McKinnon, who is just so lovably weird.

2028,jpalmetto,Disappointed as a woman viewer,2,17 July 2016,"I'd like to start out by saying that this is my first review of a movie EVER on IMDb because I felt strongly enough to review this movie. I went into this very open-minded and hoping for a female-led movie that I'd really love. Unfortunately, I walked away feeling disgusted - seriously! I have grown quite tired of what Hollywood views as the ""perfect equation"" for making movies like this. They really should have more faith in the intelligence of their viewers and not depend on so much exposition. The writing was poor, the jokes fell flat (I think I laughed 3 times total) and the only thing that carried it was the CGI effects for the apparitions. Otherwise, every single man in the film was hated and portrayed as either dumb, a villain, or sexist, the women were portrayed as clumsy, stupid, and ""typical"" in the way they drooled over Chris Hemsworth, and the reality they were asking the viewer to suspend was not even a reality at all! I mean seriously...you're in NYC and you're eating Papa John's pizza? Are you nuts? How many times do we have to hear about the won-ton issue with the soup? You get a hearse for the Ecto and one scene later, it is completely painted with a nuclear reactor on the top and Homeland Security cares about ghosts but not that? Also disturbing was how the ""villain"" was portrayed and it started with the line ""it's always the pale, sad ones."" How are we truly supposed to respond to that? For a movie that was so clearly meant for all audiences, there were many lines that had me scratching my head due to their offensiveness and blatant insensitivity to current events/issues in our country. I know, I know - I should not be reading into a movie like this so much. I really didn't want to, but a day later, I'm still sitting here bothered by these things. I could have held my comments off if I felt like this would be a good movie for our daughter, and I thought about writing this review within the context of ""maybe children under 10 could enjoy this,"" and that may very well be true - but when I really thought about it, I would not want my daughter to view these women scientists the way they are portrayed in this movie. They weren't strong, smart, humble, independent characters - they were portrayed as sexist, clumsy, incapable, and uneducated. Sony decided to fight the damaging comments they received early on by packaging this as an empowering set of roles for these four leading women. When you set the expectation for that and then it is so obviously NOT that, it is hard to disregard. This movie has a serious identity crisis - and by trying to include stereotypes of everyone, it ended up alienating everyone.",Ghostbusters

2030,elliekraw,"Enjoy it for what it is, not what you unrealistically expect it to be!",8,17 July 2016,"Ghostbusters was never going to be a cinematic masterpiece. It's a comedy about people who catch ghosts, which isn't exactly profound material. However, it seems as though everyone expects far too much from the movie. Male-driven comedies are taken as they are and enjoyed because all people are looking for is a good laugh and maybe some fun special effects, so why is it that a female-driven comedy has to 'prove itself' and be more than it is? The film is hilarious, with really great leading female characters (bonus points because they aren't sexualised in ANY WAY!), plus great cameos from the previous cast, as well as the funny dumb-blonde trope reversal with Chris Hemsworth. The special effects are great and I definitely recommend watching in 3D to get the full effect, seeing women working together to kick ghost ass is 100% better on the big screen. Obviously, the movie had flaws; little plot holes and a few jokes that were cringey and awkward, but if you were expecting perfection then you clearly don't understand what the movie is about. Also, it isn't going to 'ruin your childhood'. if you go into the movie expecting to hate it then you will, but if that's the case then this film wasn't made with you in mind. I say give it a chance, don't expect too much, but equally don't go in adamant that you'll hate it. I had the most fun watching Ghostbusters than I've had watching anything so far this year; you'll have such a good time if you let yourself really enjoy the movie for what it is.

In saying that, more of the old cast should have been mixed in with the This new cast to give it more of a sense of being a continuation of the original two movies. Ghostbusters (2016)seemed to be an unorganized un- funny mess. The biggest disappointment was the ugly car they called ecto with the big ugly yellow light on the roof.....

It was funny and had the right amount of nostalgia for the fans of the old movies, while still being its own movie. There were a few jokes that fell flat for me, but not every joke is going to be a hit with every viewer. Overall it was fun, silly, and I am definitely looking forward to the sequel they teased at in the very end.

The special effects are NOT done in a bad way. You can see where they took extra time with the actors and enhancing their images on screen.

2035,multiplexhistory-23648,"Hard to love, but equally hard to hate",6,17 July 2016,"It's hard, throughout Paul Feig's reboot of beloved 80s classic Ghostbusters, to work out whether you're enjoying it or actually just enjoying remembering the original.It's also impossible to watch it without being aware of the ridiculous outrage from certain sections of the internet community at the simple fact that four women could be Ghostbusters. This sort of misogyny apparently still goes on, in 2016.The fury started as soon as the project was announced, in 2014, and hasn't let up since – often intensifying with every new piece of news about it.But amongst the crap there was, quite fairly, the same genuine concerns that accompany any potential franchise reboot. Could the fun of the originals be recaptured? Could a Ghostbusters movie be a Ghostbusters movie without Bill Murray?The problems were surely supposed to be hidden within those two questions. That the movie wouldn't be funny enough, with Paul Feig directing and Kristen Weig and Melissa McCarthy starting, seemed the least of its potential problems.It's odd, then, that the actual issue with this reboot – which stars Weig, McCarthy, Kate McKinnon and Leslie Jones as a band of Ghostbusters who come together after Manhattan is invaded by ghosts – is a lack of laughs. All of the fun of the originals is here and a painstaking attention to detail means this looks, feels and romps along like a Ghostbusters movie should. Although Kate McKinnon's wacky Jillian appears to be in a totally different film to everyone else, the four main leads strike up enough chemistry.But there are barren periods where the jokes consistently fail to land or, in the case of Chris Hemsworth's Kevin, are pretty much dead on arrival. There's definitely a problem with the character work, too. Erin and Abby have very little to distinguish between them – a problem the film never resolves and strangely leaves Melissa McCarthy with less to do than the other three Ghostbusters.",Ghostbusters

2037,stargazer-88719,Fun summer flick! Nods to the original while creating its own story,8,17 July 2016,"I have very fond memories of the first ghostbusters. The original movie, with its cast and story, was amazing! I could, and have, literally watched it countless times. The new movie is an excellent re-boot. It has nods to the original movie while creating its own solid, funny story. It has great action sequences while still always moving the movie forward. Having said that, the original ghostbusters is iconic and anyone who is expecting this movie to do the same is going to be disappointed. If you truly love the original, no remake, male or female cast, will ever compare (if you want proof, even the original cast could not make another movie as good as the original- look at ghostbusters 2). Just because it isn't as amazing as the original (remakes rarely are), that doesn't mean that this movie isn't worth seeing. The whole cast is solid with Kate McKinnon's character being especially hilarious. As for the male bashing that some IMDb reviewers have commented on (many of which were put up 5 days before it was released), I'm not entirely sure where that is coming from. It seems to be based on the fact that the only male characters are either villains or are limited to the ditzy role of secretary. There are very few (if any) gender specific references or jokes at all in this movie.If you want to see a funny, entertaining comedy, see this movie! It was a fun summer flick!",Ghostbusters
2038,riellis,Awesome Movie!,9,17 July 2016,"Love, love this movie. This movie was very entertaining. I do not believe that the reviewers that gave this movie a 1or a 2 star even attempted to actually watch the movie. This movie definitely didn't deserve a bad review, it's people like that, that ruin it for the people that actually enjoy good movies. I guess these type of people are unhappy with themselves that they think they have the right to say these things. For those that read these reviews, please do not believe in what they say, this movie deserves a chance because it was actually very good. I hope they continue with a part 2 because I would definitely go see it.",Ghostbusters
2039,tessmorganhwife,An incredible movie for all ages unless you hate women,10,17 July 2016,"This movie was excellent, the graphics, casting, jokes and sets were all amazingly perfect for this movie. It has amazing representation for queer women and people of colour. The geeky male didn't get the girl like so many movies have them do, none of the women were sexualized for the sake of getting sexualized, the only person that was was the dumb blond role, which was played by a man for once. It's so nice to see that a movie has catered towards women with out making us feel dumb or like we should only like rom-coms, this movie has something for everyone and everyone should go see it, the only problem is how Patty, the black woman, was portrayed as the only ghost-buster that isn't intelligent, the others all work at a university or college and Patty works in a subway. It plays on the stereotypes that black women are trying to break out of and prove wrong, they could have easily just made her a history professor that grew up in NYC, she would still know all there is to know about getting around on the subway. They could have even thrown in a cameo and have that person be the one to show them onto the subway tracks for finding the ghost. Patty had a lot of wasted potential and if there is a sequel I hope that it gets explained. Other than that this movie was incredible and worth the watch.",Ghostbusters
2040,sarahbrown-49664,Better than the original!,10,17 July 2016,"I am in disbelief that this movie could receive such horrible reviews before it was even released! The new Ghostbusters had me laughing until I was crying and in my honest opinion, it was better the original movie. I did not have high expectations from this movie. I really thought it was going to be a bunch of politically correct crap but I was so wrong.In fact, the actresses were portrayed as smart and strong but I never once got the sense that movie was just some men hating propaganda. I certainly hope to see more movies feature strong female leads. It's about time! Please go see the movie yourself before taking the negative reviews to heart!",Ghostbusters
2041,aoifejward,A Lot of Fun,9,17 July 2016,"So I usually don't have as much time to write reviews as the dudes living in their parents basements, but with a film like this I had to make an exception because my god did I love it, like really.Is it the funniest film I've ever seen? Probably not (though it really does have its moments).Is it one of the happiest films I've ever seen? Without a doubt.This film just really, really made me smile. I couldn't stop. It was honestly one of the few films I've ever seen that really truly brought me joy and that I urged people to go see afterwards. I mean there were some really nice throwbacks to the original films (like the scene with Holtzmann licking her guns then going to battle was just perfect) but it was still a great stand alone film. It's part of the reason I really don't get all the angst surrounding this film because the originals are still out there; if you really have such an issue with this reboot and with the idea of 4 really funny people who - spoiler alert - happen to be women being funny, then don't watch it? I mean, yea sure, is it going to get an Oscar? No. Is it going to make people happy, and make people laugh, and give young people a new generation of heroes to look up to? Definitely.They're not shitting all over the original. They're paying a really cool tribute to it and making something new, and cool, and fresh for this generation as well. I mean it's a really cool film about friendship and hunting ghosts. What's not to love about that? Honestly, it's the most fun I've had watching a movie in years.",Ghostbusters

I went to see this movie because I wanted to give it a fair chance, there are plenty, an I mean PLENTY of movies that have empowered, three-dimensional main characters (such as Alien, Kill Bill and Pulp Fiction, just to name a few), but I left with a awful taste in my mouth. This wasn't a good movie, it wasn't an empowering movie, it wasn't worth being called a direct-to-television sequel. It was simply a pallet-swap of the main characters on a gutted and toned- down version of a thirty-year-old classic comedy, with sexist and racist undertones. Just go to the dollar bin at Wal-Mart and buy the first two movies, thanks for reading and hopefully I saved you time and money for something worth spending it on.",Ghostbusters
2043,aloalba,"Wonderful, One of the Best Movies of the Summer",9,17 July 2016,"The only reason I didn't vote 10/10 is because there's always room for improvement! However, this movie was so wonderful. I've watched the originals before but I never became a super fan like those who seem to be complaining about this one. The cast is great, the jokes are funny, the plot is wonderful and interesting. Many are complaining about the way the receptionists is portrayed but there isn't a problem at all. Most of the complains are from men who hate the ""Dumb Blond"" trope when its pointed at them, but when it's a woman it just happens to be okay. But Kevin as a character was okay as comedic relief. The CGI was a little cartoony, but honestly, that to me was just a nod to the originals. Patty honestly was so relatable and funny. Holtz was wonderful and had such great facial expressions. An the relationship between Abby and Erin was so good and pure, I loved how all the Ghostbusters and Kevin worked well together.I've seen a lot of the new movies that came out this summer, and this one is honestly one of the greatest. I recommend everyone to see this movie, especially those who keep giving this movie such a bad score without even seeing it first. If you see a score here that is 3/10 stars and below its from people who have not seen this movie. Honestly, there is no reason for this film to be rated so low.",Ghostbusters
2044,inspectorallie,"A Solid, Fun Movie",7,17 July 2016,"I wasn't sure what to expect of this movie, as I am of all remakes, but I was pleasantly surprised. The film was well composed, with pithy writing and excellent CGI. It matched the feeling of the earlier films, but with a modern refresh to the humor. It's definitely comparable to the first Ghostbusters, and outshines the second. Overall, the female representation was excellent. To see four badass women in non-sexualized outfits being *people* and having deep dynamics and kicking butt without a romantic subplot or skintight catsuits was a thing of beauty.My husband, son, and daughter were all absolutely enraptured by this film. It was fun. The heroes were vibrant and full of energy and personality. The whole dang movie theater was on its feet at the end, whooping and cheering.This movie felt good. The mad science mayhem felt good. The special effects felt good. And the look on my kid's faces as they watched the heroes win the day felt amazing.There need to be more movies like this. I would watch every last one. Nicely done.",Ghostbusters

2046,kyoto-87095,"Hilarious, fun, and good hearted",6,17 July 2016,"This was a fun, funny playful movie. The characters meshed well together, and there were ways that the movie challenges viewers to think in an edgy but kind way. I can't wait to watch it again, to catch many of the more subtle jokes that I likely missed. It's clear a lot of thought went into the many layers of references and nerdy jokes throughout. I suspect that in the background, there will be revenues to science, the prior movie, or other jokes that will be overlooked the first time around. The way academic sconce depart,nets were spoofed was particularly enjoyable to me, as someone who has suffered in academia for decades. Loved it!!!",Ghostbusters
2047,contactme-13203,"Everything I could have wanted, and more.",10,17 July 2016,"I expected this movie to be fun, maybe like Ivan Reitman's Evolution (a movie often compared to the male version of Ghostbusters he directed in the 1980s). A good enough popcorn movie. I was looking forward to it more as an event (a new Ghostbusters movie!) than I was looking forward to the movie itself, which I expected to enjoy, but not, you know, love.But when it came out on Thursday night and people actually started seeing it? And talking about it? Oh my gosh, did my excitement grow. I saw women talking about the relationships among the characters, I saw queer kids talking about how amazing Kate McKinnon's performance is, I saw a lot of things that I don't often see when people are talking about blockbuster summer fare.And lest the usual crowd of malcontents pop up to say that women and queer people aren't a reason to see a movie? No one said they were the *only* reason, and decent representation makes for a heck of a tiebreaker, let me tell you that. I didn't have a chance to see it until Sunday, but by that point things had reached a fever pitch. I can't remember the last time I was looking forward to a movie as much as I was looking forward to this one.I saw it in a packed theater, and I was not disappointed. It blew me away.It's not going to be as iconic to me as the original was, because I saw the original when I was five and grew up with it. But boy, do I envy the kids for whom this is THE Ghostbusters movie. They're in for a heck of a ride. This is a better action movie than the male version was (though in fairness, it wasn't trying to be). It's funnier. It's scarier. The characters are deeper and better written, and they're also kind of better people? Even the deeply flawed (and utterly amazing) Jillian Holtzmann is still fundamentally a nicer person than Peter Venkman. I wouldn't necessarily want to be stuck in an elevator with either one of them, but I know which one I'd rather be at a party with.Well, I take that back. Holtz would probably be able to get the elevator moving.",Ghostbusters
2048,chrisromer-26206,Best of the Ghostbusters franchise,9,17 July 2016,"This was a great movie. Having recently watched the original, for the thirteenth time since I saw it originally, I can tell you that this adaptation is better. It's funny, because people will overlook how horribly bad the original was at points. Like the the original Star Wars. In both, the acting is painful.The original GB feels like actors playing at acting. The newer version feels so less often. Granted, neither version has a director that can bring out the talent. At least the latter knows they have work to do.Go see it. Ignore the white males going crazy about it being remade. Have fun!",Ghostbusters
2049,reidpippy,You people must be joking!,10,17 July 2016,"When I first heard there would be a Ghostbusters reboot with an all female cast, I was extremely happy. I hate to sound like a 'feminazi' but having a classic movie remade with all the main characters as females made me overjoyed. Keep in mind these characters are flawed, they aren't the typical 'Marie Sue', and it's different to have females in a popular well-known movie who aren't extremely sexualized. I was expecting bad reviews but after reading said bad reviews I was stunned at the completely idiotic reasons for hating such a fun, light, and all around pretty enjoyable film. People say it was 'not needed' to have a sequel, but are they aware that this film franchise took no time to pump out Ghostbusters 2? Newsflash, the reason films are created is to make money, they don't care how. Also a very common complaint is the movie is 'man hating', this is by far the less intelligent complaint of all. How is the film man hating? Is it because there is a ditsy male main character? I am not sure how long these reviewers have been on this planet, but if you have been watching movies, i'de say it's pretty damn common to find an airhead female character. People are so quick to insult a movie with a dominantly female cast, it's insane. All in all, the movie was very funny, had lovable characters, and had nice cgi.",Ghostbusters
2050,davidmhow-04255,Surprisingly Entertaining!,8,17 July 2016,"SPOILER ALERT: may contain information that may shed light on certain elements of the story. This was done unintentionally and I tried to be very vague. But I apologized if it gives anything away. Please do not read further if you have not seen this film yet.I like most was not pleased a classic from my childhood was being re imagined. As Hollywood in my opinion has failed drastically in the last decade with this re imagining of many films from the same time period. Red Dawn (awful which Chris Hemsworth was in as well), Poltergeist are examples that jump to mind. Heck they are remaking, Flatliners and The Lost Boys supposedly.(awful is too good a word). There are more I sure I am forgetting. But you get my point hopefully.The originals were classics that in my opinion still hold up to this day and do not need to be remade as they were relevant in there era and just do not work necessarily outside it. Not all remakes have been bad. For example, The Mummy and The Mummy Returns, The Fly. They were remakes of the originals.I did find some jokes that fell flat but I found some in the original as well. However, many jokes did make me laugh so not all the jokes fell flat. Film is art and is meant to be interpreted and not everyone is going to get every joke. I saw similarities to the plot points from the original but the film had its own story to tell. It just used the beats that every screenplay uses. It was not just rehashing the story. However, the plot points thing you'll find that in many films. It like screen writing one oh one.The visuals were simply superb. And the actor for Silicon Valley was the right casting choice and I really enjoyed the opening sequence he was in. It brought me back to the kid I was when I watched the original. I also liked how characters were introduced. The interactions felt to me legit and believable.I thought the ladies did very well in their roles. I found Leslie Jones delightful. I think she broke the stereotype and evolved. Which every character needs to do for a story to work. I think all the ladies played off each other well. Andy Garcia's scenes could have been better. Feel like he phoned this one in. Chris Hemsworth, let it all hang out and it worked for me. He really owned the character and I found that made him identifiable. You see what I mean when you sit down and watch.The cameos were amusing, as well as, the various Easter eggs throughout. Keep your eyes open people. Stay all the way through the credits. IMAX 3-D is the only way to go. This is a must for this type of visual film.As it is starting to do well financially I like to see the sequel setup take fruition. I think they learn from any mistakes the made and the sequel will be that much better for it.I would suggest everyone give it a chance. I was certainly entertained. I tried to be vague in my opinion and not give anything away. I saw it this afternoon and liked what I saw.David How 7/17/2016",Ghostbusters

It was awesome! Melissa Mc Carthy plays a smart scientist without the usual gross-out lines she's been having to utter in recent films. Kate McKinnon is pure comic genius, and Leslie Jones is great in an understated role as a transit worker who's under-appreciated for her brains. Kristin Wiig, always a talented actress, doesn't have as much personality here as the others, but plays her part well. Plot was better than the original version (with great riffs on the original) and the special effects can't be beat. IMAX and 3-D made it the most exciting movie I've seen in years. Some of the dialogue could have been smarter or wittier, but all in all, great fun. I plan to see it again, and not just for the scenes of Chris Hemsworth dancing. This is the first time I've been to a movie when NO ONE LEFT THE THEATER UNTIL THE SCREEN WENT DARK. How many films can you say that about? Bravo, Ghostbusters!",Ghostbusters

So like with everything else I decided to see for myself (which I urge you to do!) So we went as a group, my mom, my cousin and her three friends, and from the jump we were hooked. I laughed so hard during that movie, honestly there was never a dull moment. Honestly that's all I can say without spoilers, so go and see it! Four women ghostbusters?? And Kevin!!!

An awesome female cast depicting smart, funny women. Some say this movie is ""man hating"" but all it does is reverse gender roles. How many movies out there are full of men with one woman (who happens to be a secretary?) Girl power and a delight, and who couldn't love Chris's character!!!! Honestly any fan of the original who keeps an open mind (and open to the concept of a female cast) will love this movie. I say it's a total hit, and any girl could agree. Whatever, trump. The ladies from Satetday Night live are fantastic, and Mcarthy and Wiig do it again. The characters are well rounded and impossible not to love. The plot is fast and full of humor.

The writing is smart and the jokes are funny. The best part about it in my opinion was its self awareness regarding the controversy surrounding its existence. Kristen Wiig and Melissa McCarthy make an excellent pair and Leslie Jones truly makes the ensemble feel complete. All four women do an outstanding job, but the shining star is without a doubt Kate McKinnon as Jillian Holtzmann. Chris Hemsworth is hilarious as the role reversed cute but not so smart secretary, and the cameos by Bill Murray, Dan Akroyd, Ernie Hudson, Annie Potts and Sigourney Weaver are pure gold.

2055,multiartist,A Lovingly Crafted Reboot--This Is How It Is Done,10,17 July 2016,"Loved it! A great reboot of a franchise and most decidedly NOT a remake. The original spirit (ha, spirit) of the 80s films was there along with several tasteful nods/cameos. I laughed a LOT. The performances were nuanced and each character had their own meter and timing. The four leads are not rehashes of the four originals. For example, the engineer's similarities to Egon began and ended at her glasses. She is not ""the Egon character."" There are no direct substitutes for Venkmann, Ray, or Winston, either. Some folks have made some racist assumptions that because Patty is black, she is the ""Winston."" True, she started the film as the non-scientist, but she is also well-read, believes in the mission of the team, and has a near encyclopedic knowledge of New York--a far cry from the original Winston who would believe in anything if there was a paycheck in it for him.This isn't ruining anyone's childhood anymore than 15 different Batman re-starts have. Forget what you've heard--mostly from people who are giving it a bad review based on what they think it is and without having seen it, i.e. a giant chunk of the IMDb negative reviews--and give it a chance on its own merits. This is a movie that stands on its own.",Ghostbusters

The jokes were lame and adolescent with utterly no effort shown by the cast to deliver anything in the way of entertainment. Everyone should be embarrassed on this one. This movie is godawful. I can only imagine what the studio budget was for shill reviews on RT or metacritic. Don't believe the hype, this one sucks. So much potential wasted.

I've heard nothing but ""It's hilarious"" and ""It's the perfect nod to the movies"" from friends - and I was not disappointed. The chemistry between the four leads - and Chris Hemsworth - is fantastic. Their comedic styles are all different but it WORKS. We were loudly laughing with the whole theater to the point that our stomachs hurt. And on the flip side, the research and conviction towards the paranormal and science was what you hope for with the franchise. We laughed, gasped and clapped for every cameo. It doesn't try to be the originals - it doesn't need to. New universe - new story. But the nods to the originals - and NY - were perfect.I will be seeing this multiple times.

Some guys don't understand I guess, it's their loss. It's a rare movie that we get to see women doing the ass kicking, all while not wearing booty shorts! Mad Max (well, Charlize Theron's part), The Force Awakens...and I can't name any others recently.Saw it with my 5 year old daughter who I made watch the original movies but who then told me ""Mommy I want to see the one with the girls.""

Fun to see all the old- timey references to the original Ghostbusters and funny all the way thru. Wiig and McCarthy have tons of jokes of course; Jones is very funny and personable and keeps the whole crew grounded; MacKinnon is just plain funny with every move she makes. The sets and special effects are really gorgeous. We saw it in 3-D which I highly recommend. Jones' character should not be called ""subway worker.""

Erin and Abby had the broken friendship between them, but they got through that and Erin even saved Abby's life. The special effects during that was really cool. Kind of a muffled, not quite on this plane sound and neat lighting. I was so relieved to see them pass from the green part of the vortex to the red. And Holtzmann! She is flirty, brilliant and funny! She's definitely one of the movie's highlights. All of her scenes were fantastic. All of them. Patty injects a sense of, well, sense into the group. Considering Erin jumped into a swirling portal of death the group is really, really going to need that. She's also kind of relatable, a grounding point in the science crazy that the others take for granted. Also, I like how the group is protective of Kevin, dumdum that he is. He tries!

The music is great, the acting is very good, the cameos made by some of the cast of the original Ghostbusters were fantastic and paid homage to the original without over doing it. I cannot say enough about how great this movie was. I would go back to see it a third time! So so so good! worth every penny. It is a really fun movie to watch. The humor is really great. The jokes are extremely funny. The whole theater was belly laughing for most of the movie. I love the four main characters so much. I cannot choose who I loved more. All four of the lead actresses were hilarious and kept me laughing. This is a wonderful movie, I give it 10 out of 10 I would recommend this to anyone looking to have a great time at the theaters.

Having a non-sexualized, all female group with a diverse bunch of personalities, strengths and weaknesses, and a story that's doesn't rely on romance (the most important relationship being the friendship between the girls) was truly a breath of fresh air. Chris Hemsworth's twist on the 'token dumb blonde female secretary' trope was hilarious and i loved every second he was on screen. I only wish that there were more movies like this when i was younger, seeing girls who were weird and were totally OK with being weird would have certainly helped with some self-acceptance issues i know i (as well as many other girls) had. Also, the fact that, despite not being a genius like the rest of the group, patty was extremely knowledgeable about the city and all of its hotspots was awesome! and you have to admit, fighting off a ghost-possessed friend with one arm while trying to prevent your other friend from falling to their death (or at least some serious damage) with the other is pretty badass.",Ghostbusters
2064,nwebb-45171,An entertaining homage to a classic,9,18 July 2016,"As a believer in the saying ""don't fix what ain't broke"", I was skeptical when I heard they were remaking Ghostbusters. It's a timeless, classic piece of cinema that will continue to be loved for decades more to come. When the news broke of a remake, I was horrified, sure that any reboot would be nothing but insulting to the original.However, I gave into the temptation and before I knew it found myself sitting in the cinema. To my sheer delight, I was blown away by how hilarious and entertaining the movie truly was. The delivery and comedic timing from each of the leading ladies had me laughing out loud throughout the entire film, and each nod to the original gave me the warm fuzzies. Smiling like an idiot throughout the entire film, I fell in love with each of the new characters and found myself once again enthralled and invested in the adventures of the Ghostbusters team. Whilst the original Ghostbusters could never and will never be replaced, the 2016 Ghostbusters is a brilliant rendition of a classic story, featuring some of the most brilliant and talented women currently working in comedy.The film is not perfect, and I still question whether or not Sony should have made a sequel rather than starting from scratch with a complete reboot. But nonetheless, Ghostbusters is a feel-good comedy that kept me entertained throughout and left me giddy with excitement afterwards.",Ghostbusters

For all these folks whining and crying about the first Ghostbusters movie, which I loved so much as a teen that my brother and I would quote it and I would dream about being a ghost buster not a receptionist or damsel in distress, please get a hold of yourselves. I watched the first one after the reboot and honestly, for all those lavishing praise on it, I saw things about it that aren't so great, like Venkmann's smarmy, lecherous professor at the beginning trying to convince a young co-ed she has powers...the sort of tasteless and completely pointless scene of Ray having a specter visit him in the night for a little pleasure. I find it humorous so many folks think the new movie lacks plot and substance, it wasn't like the first didn't have some stupid parts and tasteless bits (and I say that while still loving it). I personally found this movie fun, exciting and hilarious and refreshing in that it didn't try to stick in some romance bit and focused instead on the friendship factors of the team. It made me laugh way more than I expected to and I found the special effects to be pretty awesome, especially in 3D. I have rarely jumped into cyberspace to defend a film so vehemently, but this is the movie I would have loved to see as a 13 year old but I'm just as glad that I got a chance to see it now, and that my young daughter got to see female characters that weren't princesses or romantic leads being funny and smart and strong. She loved it too and I certainly hope there will be a second!!!",Ghostbusters
2066,spinmearound,Definitely worth the watch,9,18 July 2016,"I have the (probably rare) viewpoint of someone who has never seen the original(s) but honestly despite this, I'm not sure what some people are talking about. I absolutely adored this movie! The comedy was on point, the four leading ladies absolutely compelling and hilarious. Major props to Kate McKinnon in her portrayal of Jillian Holtzmann who was a standout character for me. I saw this movie twice and both times the cinema was full of laughter. Melissa McCarthy is always a hit and miss actress for me but boy was this a 'hit' movie for her. Not sure what the fuss is about regarding 'man-hating' because neither my boyfriend or I got any vibes of the sort from the movie. Regardless, it was a great movie that didn't rely too heavily on nostalgia and managed to stand on its own two feet.",Ghostbusters
2067,rustedmail,The new Ghostbusters is fun and you should see it,9,18 July 2016,"Pretty sure a significant number of reviewers haven't seen the movie, and I can't help but wonder if the ones complaining about sexism have seen the original. I'd like to avoid spoilers, so I'll just say the gendered jokes in this version come nowhere close to the sketchiness in the original (which I loved despite its flaws).This movie is genuinely funny. The cast did a great job, the plot was fun, and the effects were good. The theater was moderately full, and by the end, the entire audience was laughing practically nonstop. Sadly, this is probably destined to become a sleeper hit. When the over-saturation of remakes has died down, and the noise from people screaming that this is the sign of the Feminist Apocalypse has quieted, hopefully the movie will get the credit it deserves.",Ghostbusters
2068,vulgarisest,Instant Favorite,10,18 July 2016,"I absolutely fell in love with this movie!!! I can not get over how cool and awesome the characters were. The Ghostbusters are all smart, funny and as complex as you get in a comedy. That's right, it's a comedy, a fun, lighthearted, sometimes cheesy much like the original. I was entertained the entire time, I didn't find any of the moments slow and I loved all the cameos! I loved the Abby/Erin relationship- it speaks true to the friendships I have. Even when you've fallen out and having spoken in a while, once you get back together it's like nothing has changed. I was glad they had that comrade throughout. McCarthy and Wiig have great chemistry and it shows! I loved Leslie Jones as Patty, she was so sweet and funny. I think she balanced the cast very well and kept me laughing the entire movie. My favorite character had to be Holtzmann, hands down. She was so funny, so smart, and I loved her style. All of the weapons were so cool! It honestly made me wish I was more mechanically inclined so I could make props of those weapons. I've always been a huge fan of McKinnon on SNL but she shinned in this movie more than she gets to on SNL. I legit wish I could be Holtzmann, or at least work on being a person who let's their freak flag fly and doesn't care what anyone thinks. I already bought tickets to see it again this weekend and I'm on the lookout for more merch. I can't wait for more!",Ghostbusters

Comedy is extremely subjective, but if you like Paul Feig movies I think you'll enjoy this one.It's a remake where women are the Ghostbusters (shocking!). If that puts you off seeing this movie than that is very sad.Nostalgia is very delusional in my opinion. Remember Ghostbusters 2? it sucked.",Ghostbusters
2070,parmajeanne,Wait until it comes out on DVD,5,18 July 2016,"This is my first review - sorry, a bit poorly written:A little background about me: I'm a woman, I have a daughter, and I went to see this movie on ""principle"". I like the idea of my daughter having strong women to look up to on screen, and I wanted to support this. I very rarely go to movie theaters, unless it's something that I feel MUST be seen in theaters (i.e. Star Wars).All that said, the movie was okay. Probably will not watch it again, but I didn't hate it. It had some laughs (less than I was expecting, maybe some jokes flew over my head). My 7 year old, who was terrified at some scenes and wanted to walk out at one point - eventually got used to it and actually enjoyed the climax, ending - which in her words , were ""even scarier"". I had high hopes because of Wiig/McCarthy - and I did find that McCarthy was much more tolerable in this film compared to previous. (I like her, but sometimes she can be a bit over the top). That said, the movie was a bit ""meh"" in the comedy department for me.I can't even remember the characters names, I realized afterward, which is odd. My daughter and I both enjoyed ""the one with the goggles"" - she was pretty funny.I did not enjoy what they did with the dumb receptionist. That was over-the-top. I think they would have made more of a point with making him competent and doing his job, but I realize they would have lost some cheap jokes that way (which I didn't find very funny). They were also pushing the, these women are super smart scientists, while throwing around huge non-nonsensical words, but it felt a bit manufactured to me. My daughter did leave the theatre saying she wanted to be a scientist like the one with the goggles, which is a win, but she was already interested in science so I can't attribute all of that to the movie.So - I wasn't totally thrilled that I forked over a small fortune to see this in 3D (I was expecting better), but my daughter enjoyed it so all is not lost.",Ghostbusters
2071,mizujada,Great Comedy,9,18 July 2016,"Really enjoyed this comedy. I laughed through most of the movie. Kate McKinnon and Leslie Jones in particular were hilarious. The four Ghostbuster characters had great chemistry and played off each other really well. I thought it might just be a remake of the original, but while they showed a lot of love for the 1984 film, they took the time to make their own plot. All of the cameos and references are really enjoyable - it's great to see the original cast in their new roles.Everyone in this movie clearly had a blast making it. Chris Hemsworth especially seemed happy to be doing something different and seemed to have a lot of fun in his role. I would love to know how much of what he does is improv and how much was scripted.Great ghosts, great action scenes, great jokes. This movie is a great addition to the franchise. Definitely recommend it! I hope there is a sequel to this one, too.",Ghostbusters
2072,kreno-45899,Ignore the angry reviewers and give this movie a chance!,10,18 July 2016,"I knew going into the theater that this was going to be full of cheesy humor and hefty laughs, and I wasn't disappointed. If you were a fan of Bridesmaids, the humor is similar and has just as many laugh-out-loud moments. If your brand of humor is no where near Bridesmaids, you might not like this movie (no harm, no foul). What I ask is that you at least give it a chance with an open mind instead of either: reviewing the movie without even seeing it, or going into the movie with your mind made up that this cannot be good since they are remaking such a national treasure (let alone with all women)! Is this a 10/10? Of course not. I wouldn't rank the original as 10/10, either. That being said, I would seriously consider watching this movie a couple more times while in theater because I found it that funny/entertaining. It simply might not be your cup of tea humor-wise, but I definitely got a kick out of it. So I ask you to give it a chance!",Ghostbusters
2073,wlturland,Pathetic,1,18 July 2016,"Let's be clear: the reason this movie sucks has ZERO to do with gender and everything to do with terrible writing and direction. The whole thing falls incredibly flat and tinny thanks to a never ending parade of tired tropes, recycled visual gags poorly executed, and insipid self-nods. Worst of all, there is no saving grace here, nothing to redeem this horrid pile of D List shlock. The only thing even remotely entertaining about this film is watching all of the neckbeards cry about casting while trying to claim sexism. Awww, your representation was reduced to vapid eye candy? How awful that must feel!",Ghostbusters

They love the original and they LOVED this one. I expected to love Melissa McCarthy but I'm not really a fan of Kristin Wiig. I did, but Kate McKinnon and Leslie Jones really stole the show. I even enjoyed Kristin Wiig in it.So many laughs! There were plenty of jokes for the adults as well as the kids.The entire theater was laughing through most of it. There are plenty of nods to the original without just being a reboot. And so many cameos!I can't say enough that all of the predictions that it would be terrible were totally wrong.",Ghostbusters
2075,rainforest-05578,"Unfunny, Unnecessary and Unworthy of the franchise it leeches off of",1,18 July 2016,"This film was, to put it bluntly, a mistake. After the originally planned Ghostbusters III project died following the sad passing of Harold Ramis in 2014, the franchise should've been left as it was, left to enjoy the legacy it left upon Hollywood. Why it was felt necessary to then re-sculpt this perfect concept is beyond me, even more so considering it's chosen re-designer was Paul Feig. PAUL FEIG. But this was just the first of many bad decisions. They opted to completely reboot the franchise, rejecting any of the original plot devices. They gave the original cast pointless cameos, teasing at the many opportunities that were wasted. They made the characters two-dimensional caricatures with no substance or interesting qualities. And all this before the film was even released, but I decided to give it a chance - I was greatly (but not unexpectedly) disappointed. This film was, quite frankly, as much of a mess as it was a re-hash. It simply rides off of the legacy of the original films, but brings nothing new to the table - The plot very closely resembles that of the original film; all that's new is an incompetent script and some new CGI effects (that are somehow less believable than those used in the original two films from the '80s). So asides from using the power of nostalgia to fool people into watching this film, what does it bring to the table? It brings together a group of four actresses (two of whom I know to bevery talented after seeing them in other films) and completely wastes them on a script so cringe worthy it sounds like it was written by a 14 year old. The characters, as I mentioned, are badly written, none less so then Chris Hemsworth's character, whom is so stupid that it's almost painful to watch. This act is supposed to, somehow, be funny; however, most people over the age of 12 will probably feel otherwise. And it's very noticeable that basically every male character in this film is portrayed as being idiotic, cowardly or an arsehole. This film does focus a lot on gender. We get it. The film has been gender swapped. Very clever. It doesn't mean you have to constantly remind us. We know, just focus on making the movie funny instead of forcing the main cast to spend half the time gawping at Hemsworth. I have no problem with their being a mainly female cast, most of them are very talented actresses; my issue is with the writing and the way they had to make such a point about the fact it's been gender swapped. The script was immature, and simply just tried to hard - It failed to deliver. Another issue is the gadgets and action sequences; this film focuses far too much on these things - It just ends up becoming noisy and unbelievable, the plot gets very little attention. Another thing that gets very little attention is the direction. This films relies heavily on jump cuts and just isn't shot very smoothly - It becomes almost a little jarring to watch at times. In fact, I'm hard pressed to find any real merits at all with this movie. I only laughed once throughout the whole film, this came thanks to a certain screaming man (you'll know what I'm referring to if you've seen it). But asides this, there really is nothing worth seeing in this movie. The original cast cameos, that many people were excited for, were all boring and pointless (they made Bill Murray unfunny...how?!). And the entire film is a boring, unfunny mess with a CGI heavy finale that is sure to disappoint. So on the whole, if I were you, I'd save your money for a different film...any other film. And if you want a proper Ghostbusters sequel, play Ghostbusters: The Video Game (on Xbox 360 or PS3); this game has all the original writers and cast; it's practically the third film that never was...and you get to be a part of it. Basically, don't bother.",Ghostbusters
2076,voronale,"Laugh out loud funny, loved it, will see it again",10,18 July 2016,"I am going to see this movie again. I loved it. Was laughing out loud often and towards the end I realized I had this massive grin on my face that stayed for the rest of the day. It's funny, feel good comedy.McKinnon as Holtzman was my personal favorite but the four Ghostbusters were all great and had good chemistry together. Helmsworth as their secretary was a gem. It's quirky, silly, and was amazing to watch a movie with four women where not one of them was a love interest. (Well, actually I'm pretty sure Holtzman was interested in Wiig's character) Give me more please.

Engaging, entertaining, laugh out loud funny and yet with enough emotional moments to anchor it for the audience and the characters. The breakout star of this movie is undoubtedly Kate McKinnon - here's to hoping Ghostbuster is for her what Bridesmaid was for Melissa McCarthy. An energetic and captivating performance, McKinnon makes a banquet of what she's given and you simply cannot take your eyes off her. The cameos amp the nostalgia up to 11, Hemsworth is delightfully dim, and the entire cast's chemistry is off the chart.

Love the original quartet. My thinking was, and is with other franchises, these two movies are greatRegardless, I wanted to see the Ghostbuster ""reboot"" (I feel that's a problematic term. This is more of a reimagining of the story. I've heard the term ""DNA sequel"", so let's go with that.)As a mid-30s male, I'll address the demographic that I suspect is tearing this movie apart: to you 30-40something males who grew up with the original franchise, give it a rest. No one is stealing your childhood memories. Nor is your sexist vitriol helping matters. And to the few people who didn't like the movie and presented legitimate reasons: thank you for at least building your case -- though even if you don't like the sum total that is the movie, how can you not like Kate McKinnon and Chris Hemsworth? They stole the show!Still, you're entitled to your opinion. It's those that shoot invective directly at the female cast (simply for the movie HAVING a female cast) that make me facepalm and feel ashamed of my gender. Bill Murray got over himself; why can't you?Now that I have that out of my system...I would suggest that you ignore the hype (negative and otherwise), see the movie for yourself, and make up your own mind. It'll no doubt attract new/young fans, and that's okay. That, in my mind, doesn't take away from the legacy of the originals. Moreover, the new movie pays affectionate homage to those very movies (the resurfacing of the original lab and the cameos alone...so worth it). Beyond that, the story keeps the spirit (har har) of the originals alive. Not to deep, just the right amount of cheesy, good banter amongst the leading cast (and the lesser known cast, IMO, like Kate McKinnon and Leslie Jones really shine). Even the ghost effects...the special effects people could've gone full CGI but they preserve the look and feel of the originals nicely. The result is a movie that is simultaneously fresh but also comfortably familiar.I was also impressed with Neil Casey as Rowan -- the epitome of genius gone bad. Nice touch that he used the very methods and beliefs that Erin and Abby eschewed in their book.And again...Chris Hemsworth. Nuff said. So, I liked it over all. I really liked it. I suggest giving the movie a try; even if you are a die hard and are wary of reboots, I feel there's value in this movie and a laugh or two, to boot. If you're just taking the negative hype at wholesale value, at least go see the movie so you know what you're avoiding.",Ghostbusters
2079,alyspryde,Practically perfect in every way,10,18 July 2016,"This is the movie I desperately wanted when I saw the original in 1984, but I had to grin and bear the unending sexist one-liners back then. This is a gift to teenage me, who wanted women who honestly liked each other, flirted with each other, risked their lives for each other, rescued each other, and barely noticed men except as impediments to be worked around, and wanted it in an SF&F world.Every woman in the cast really just SHONE with how much fun she was having at all times, though especially Kate McKinnon and Leslie Jones. Still, I love Melissa McCarthy and Kristin Wiig -- they were the heart of the story, even as McKinnon and Jones ran away with the scenes.I want to see Patty get some shinier writing in the sequel. i want to see more of Holtzmann's mentor.

It certainly isn't a cinematic masterpiece, but then again neither were the original Ghostbusters films. It seems as if suddenly, thousands are heralding the Ghostbusters franchise as the greatest in existence, when in reality they've always just been good comedic romps that are seldom dwelled upon afterwards. However, this film is something that I, and many others, can't get enough of. It's more than refreshing to see a group of women kicking ass and taking names while forming meaningful relationships with each other, all without any romantic subplot developing in the wings. The women and their relationship with each other is perhaps the most enjoyable part of this film, each incredibly talented actress bringing something unique to the table.

But after watching it in the cinema, I have to say, it surely left me much more than just satisfied at the results. The main cast was well chosen and spot on, a very clever reversion of roles from the original movie while still giving the new cast their own quirks and personalities. I couldn't contain my excitement at times during the action scenes, which were packed with emotion and hilarious gags. Speaking of such gags, the comedy in the movie was simply fantastic to my tastes, I couldn't stop laughing while watching it, and that says something, since it's somewhat hard to make me laugh so much in a movie. The story line diverges from the one in the original movie, turning this reboot into something that stands alone from the originals, making it it's own original creation. The special effects were pretty great, not as marvelous as the ones in other recent movies, but it fits into the comical and lively aesthetic of the story. In general, this was an amazing movie, I highly recommend it to those who seek a fun and action packed sci-fi movie to watch.",Ghostbusters
2082,shelbyharper,So much better than I thought it would be!,10,18 July 2016,"Despite what all these nasty reviews may say, I went into the movie expecting the worst and coming out realizing it was better then the original by a long shot. I grew up watching the originals and seeing an all female reboot idea at first scared me: I thought it would stray from the original and make it a disaster. To my absolute pleasure there was no complaining from me at all. The cast was perfect: it was a close enough replicate of the original (I particularly was fond of Kate Mckinnons character Jillian Holtzmann) the jokes were funny and the CGI wasn't terrible at all, (If you can have the opportunity to watch it in 3D is it particularly good, slime everywhere!) The two boys I went with enjoyed it just as much as me, and they were fanatics of the original as well. The cameos were incredible, and I thought the villain was interesting and very realistic. It was incredible to see the two sides of neglect: those who make the most of it and those who let it cloud them. The heroes and the villain were excellent examples of both. It helped me realize that maybe my favorite childhood movie wasn't as good as I thought, and these talented women definitely stole the show. It was by far the best movie I have seen this year! I would definitely recommend the movie to anyone not clouded by what some random idiot fanboy on Reddit says: go into it with an unbiased opinion and it won't fail you!

2085,mbenkars,An Honest Review of the new Ghostbusters by someone whose childhood wasn't ruined just by the trailer.,8,19 July 2016,"I saw the original Ghostbusters when I was 18 as someone who adored the SNL days of Murray and Aykroyd... And to be honest my mind was not melted by the sheer genius of it. I thought it was a fine comedy, pretty original with a good cast, but I was not going to go out and get the Busters logo tattooed on my ass and spend the rest of my days walking the streets, holding crumpled Ghostbusters fan fiction and praising the writers like a raving lunatic. So now it's 2016 and we have a new Ghostbusting crew, and after seeing it with my friend and talking with her about it, we came to the conclusion there's a lot of sad and angry people over a movie that plays about as well as The Force Awakens plays as a sequel to the original Star Wars trilogy. The new cast mirrors the old cast in a lot of ways. Homage is paid abundantly through out the film. And all the old characters get a chance to smile and wink at the camera as if to say ""Remember when we were huge stars and you drooling nerds would come running up to me, screaming catch phrases and demands for autographs, when all I wanted was to have a coffee outside my house in peace? That's these people's problems now, I'm getting the Hell out of here."" Most of the complaints I saw on here are about how this is a rip off of a masterpiece that's full of man hating. If you watched the original ""masterpiece"" you would (or maybe you didn't, you were too enamored with Bill Murray's dry wit!) notice the only mentionable female character is Sigourney Weaver who is basically turned into a sexualized and possessed piece of meat for all the boys. And the only black buster is a janitor (for all those complaining that the new black lead was just a stereotypical, loud mouthed, streetwise black lady.) All in all I enjoyed the movie because it was fun and if given a sequel I would think could be about as good or probably even better than Ghostbusters 2. For all you reviewers who are sobbing for their lost Ghosbusters, now relegated to cameos in this new ""atrocity"" I leave you with this thought. Ever heard of an alternate earth or multiverse? This is the Earth where our Busters instead of chasing ghosts decided to debunk them, drive taxis, and be a funeral director while some ""strong willed young strumpets"" took up the mantle. On the other world the boys are still in town and kicking all sorts of ectoplasmic ass, frozen in time, without having to think about really scary thoughts like giving women and minorities meaningful roles, or what will become of poor Rick Moranis's career after the 2nd Buster flick. I guess this could all be summarized as this: ""The film was better than fine, and maybe don't invest all your happiness in whether your childhood classics remain untouched as this is Hollywood, where we've seen three Peter Parker Spidermen in 16 years and two Fantastic Four teams in 10. They want your ass in a seat so maybe this one isn't for you. But is it so terrible that they included the girls on this run through? The theater I was in had plenty of laughter and a lot of young women who left it full of energy and wanting to bust some ghosts which is awesome. And if you can't be selfless about your childhood memories, be selfish and think of all the new men and women now interested in your favorite franchise, people that might want to seek out the original and talk with you about it and the series in general.""",Ghostbusters
2086,instantapathy,"It entertained me, and that's all I ask of a movie.",8,19 July 2016,"So a friend and I went to see Ghostbusters last night. TL;DR version, it was fine and not a waste of money (that popcorn though... such a delicious salty ripoff). There was the standard geeky techno-babble explanations of things, a lot of action, very good CGI, and while I felt the villain was a little weak the overall plot seemed solid enough.I will preface the rest of this by saying... comedies aren't really my thing. I'm weird that way. Also, I will try to not spoil anything really, but there is probably some thematic spoiling going on in this. I'm bad with spoilers because I totally don't care about them, so I can miss them in my own comments... be warned.As anyone who is on the internet and as seen anything about this movie knows there has been a lot of bad press. I'm willing to bet that a large majority of that bad press comes from people who haven't seen the movie, and are just going on their gut reaction to the fact that women are being cast in a reboot of the franchise. The humor seemed solid to me. There was some physical stuff, which is totally in line for the original, and I can only think of a single fart joke as far as ""gross out"" type humor is concerned. I suppose the sliming that happens could fall in that category, but I put it more into the physical side... your millage may vary.There were numerous little call backs to the previous movies which were all subtle enough that if you hadn't seen the old movies they just seemed like regular dialog, as opposed to weird inside jokes you won't get. Most of the old cast had cameos in the movie, Bill Murray as a debunker, Dan Aykroyd as a cab driver, Annie Potts as a hotel desk employee, Ernie Hudson as the uncle of Patty, Sigourny Weaver as Holtzmann's mentor, and the late Harold Ramis even makes an appearance as a bust that is outside Erin's office when the dean comes to talk to her about her tenure. Rick Moranis does not appear, but he's pretty much kept out of Hollywood since his wife died so that's no surprise.Character wise Holtzman totally steals the show. To me it felt like the ""main"" characters were intended to be Kristen Wiig's Erin Gilbert and Melissa McCarthy's Abby Yates but Kate McKinnon as Jillian Holtzmann gets a ton of great lines, gets to be the total tech geek spilling out techno-babble like a Star Trek engineer, and her big action scene in the later third of the movie was extremely well done and fun to watch. Also I'd like to not that while Patty isn't a scientist she is shown as smart and is the group's history geek, so she's not a one dimensional character. Oh and Thor's, I mean Chris Hemsworth's, Kevin is a total send up of the ""pretty but dumb secretary"" trope. And that is fine.The villain, to me, was just.... I don't know how to describe it. He reminded me of the 3 geniuses from Buffy. He was creepy, and surely up to no good, but he didn't seem... scary, really. It wasn't a bad villain, exactly, but he felt a bit weak as an antagonist. Like, he would have been fine as an underling to a big bad, but as the main guy... shrugSo all in all, I thought it was a decent film. It entertained me, and that's all I ask of a movie.﻿",Ghostbusters

The only major issue was the plot, as it was kind of choppy, but the comedy and the characters made up for it. I think it was more geared towards the teenagers rather than adults, judging by the comedy and the way the movie played out. As for somebody who grew up watching the original Ghostbusters (and whose parents are die-hard fans of the series), my whole family enjoyed it. I'd definitely suggest watching it in 3D if available, though. It felt like the 3D gave more effect and more immersion than the standard version. Most people have issues with the Ghostbusters team being female. Personally, I don't see what gender of character should have to do with any review writing at all. A review is meant to be posted or written after seeing the movie, and focused more on the movies aspects, plot line, and graphics, and the personality OF the characters, rather than what gender the characters are.",Ghostbusters
2090,mgbrewer-87651,Don't Listen To Men,10,19 July 2016,"First off I'd like to start out by saying anyone who gives this movie a bad revue probably owns a fedora and has never pleasured a woman. This movie was by far one of the best remakes I have ever had the pleasure of seeing. The women in this movie were all strong, beautiful, and hilarious. The way Paul directed this movie was brilliant and visually stunning. He made a really funny movie without relying on bad language and sex jokes, which is hard to do especially in 2016. It gives me hope that one day females can have strong roles like men and it was refreshing to see a man in the secretary position, which Chris Hemsworth killed by the way. I think all mothers should take their daughters to see this movie to let them know they don't have to be stick thin, or gorgeous, or dumb to be a total bad ass. So for everyone saying that it's a bad rip off the OG obviously is sexist and probably shouldn't be allowed to have a daughter. Who you gonna call? Four amazingly talented women who can kick ass.",Ghostbusters

Seems to me with the uniforms and appearances, two or three of the actors might have been men - but who cares what bathroom they visit.I'm not sure what a reboot means in this concept. Make it like the original but without humor or cast chemistry?It was like your neighbor going to Vegas, watching a magic show and coming home to reenact it for you. Painful. Or your son's second grade class acting out La Cage aux Folles = just dreadful.Anyway, this might be palatable if you have a carload of kids to keep busy and there is a dollar matinée nearby.",Ghostbusters
2092,pdesousa,Busting makes you feel good! (2D),7,19 July 2016,"Ghostbusters (2016): Seriously guys (and I'm picking on the males in particular because they've been the main abusers online and elsewhere), give it a go, it's an absolute blast!There's copious amounts of nostalgia for the aforementioned naysayers and over-righteous fans of the original 1984 version to keep them more than enticed. This includes major and minor cameos from all of the original cast apart from Rick Moranis (retired). Even Harold Ramis (dead) appears twice along with the Manhattan fire station, Slimer and the now famous StayPuft Marsh-Mallow Man, who has spent the last few days trying to climb out of the concourse at London Waterloo Station. He is starting to look a bit frustrated now so I'm assuming he's just trying to avoid Southern Rail.The film itself follows the basic lines of the original but deviates slightly, primarily because of the gender-reversal of having women as GB's instead of men (OOH...Scary! See what they did there?). Melissa McCarthy's Abby (Ray Stantz), Kirsten Wiig's Erin (Peter Venkman), Kate McKinnon's Jillian (Egon Spengler) and Leslie Jones' Patty (Winston Zeddemore) are almost perfect and there's also the bonus of having the ridiculously handsome Chris Hemsworth (he of Thor fame) as Kevin, a bespectacled, mentally malnourished exec PA instead of... well, we all know a few of those.The opening scene is somewhat scarier than the original library scenario and there are a few more jumps when you least expect them but overall, the comedy value more than lives up to the original when the characters are interacting. The CGI ghosts and ghouls have been upped a few levels due to advanced tech and look extremely good, especially towards the final showdown with the upgraded weapons.My one small complaint is that, unlike most of his previous films (Bridesmaids, The Heat, Spy), director Paul Feig was restricted on the use of McCarthy's and Wiig's proper foul mouths (no hysterical C- bombs this time around) and full on toilet humour (there are still some more subtle ones in there though), due to the film itself having to be 'kid friendly' to grab the next generations' attention. However, the line ""Let's loosen his grip!"" and it's follow on made me grab myself in a funny, not-so- good way. That said, if Feig had said, ""Screw the kids!"" while signing the initial contract, the BBC would've probably come along and offered to double his salary...I look forward to finding an extremely unrated version on the DVD/Blu Ray.I spent the best part of two and a half hours at Cineworld, Wandsworth watching the 2D version, laughing my moobs off and gave it a solid 7/10. Having had a day or two to think about it, I may well go back and watch the 3D version simply because I want to feel that I have been properly 'lubed' so I can up that score.Also, make sure you stay to the very end of the credits.",Ghostbusters

So why did this movie kill it for me well....the jokes are not funny they almost seem forced and the acting is even bad its like they really don't want to be playing the part in the movie but their doing it any ways. its just bad! and not much to it for a reboot it felt rushed. now the CGI and graphics are awesome but that dose not make a movie. I really did want to love this movie even though they did a lot to it as a reboot i went in to it with an open mind wanting to enjoy a new version of a childhood favorite but nope...Well that is how i felt about the movie i sure some will love it and some will hate it.

2095,annatar-94070,A Horrendous movie and a dismal sequel,1,20 July 2016,"This film was low quality in every sense of the word, the acting, dialogue and plot-line was all sadly, extremely lacking. This film is far inferior to the original one and I was thoroughly disappointing upon seeing it. I would not recommend this film to any movie watchers, for the fans of the franchise though, I feel great pity, it is a massive letdown to them, one of whom is my friend. For those of us who are not fans, the disappointment will not be as big but the movie certainly fell far short of what it was parroted as being. Overall, I gave the film a 1/10 owing to not only its extremely bad story-line and dialogue, but because of how much of a deterioration it represented compared to the original, the filmmakers took a great franchise and trashed it utterly.",Ghostbusters
2096,benstrickland-35371,About as entertaining as a dog turd.,1,20 July 2016,"This was an absolute nightmare. As the crowd remained dead silent during most of the movie, with only a couple of legitimately funny moments, I wondered if this was more of a spoof than a reboot. The comedy was not fluid or natural, but rather forced upon the audience like one of the Naked Gun flicks. The girl power, all men are evil premise is crammed down our throats for the entire film. The mysterious power looking to take over the world in '84 has been replaced with the old worn-out ""evil rich white man"" that can only be stopped by struggling brilliant women. The ghosts are not original or scary. The jokes are tired, poorly constructed, and predictable. Mr. Feig and Sony should be ashamed.",Ghostbusters
2097,thandie_r,"Funny as hell, a must see. Please ignore the trolls.",8,20 July 2016,"I went to see Ghostbusters with relatively high expectations after hearing the reviews. So so AWESOME!!!!!!!!! And I mean that in every way. They used a nice mix of effects. The humour ranged from slapstick and fart jokes to the heights of subtlety and sarcasm. They played appropriate homage to the original. I also thoroughly appreciated that there was no attempt to hammer home that the leads were women. They spent most of the time trying to point out that they were scientists. They may as well have all been redheads pointing out that they were scientists. It was not an integral part of the plot, they just happened to be female. They called out a lot of the misery women put up with via offhand comments, such as the joys of high heels, but they were not critical plot points. The all female lead cast in this movie is a seismic shift in entertainment politics. But, inside the script and on the screen they were simply awesome in those roles. Bravo and thanks! And okay the exquisitely flipped script of the receptionist was a glorious vindication.... Those who are trashing this movie seem to be falling into a limited number of categories: 1: racists. 2: misogynists or 3: entitled ""I can't believe they dared to alter any part of my sacred childhood anythings"" people. A glance at the demographics of those posters says a few things. The movie was funny as hell and well worth the in theatre ticket.",Ghostbusters
2098,mdmcquaig,Exciting and Delightful!,9,20 July 2016,"I was a little worried about the film after I saw the trailers. It had that Adam Sandler feel - too much slapstick, too much suspension of disbelief, and it seemed to lack the seriousness the first film's characters had in themselves.The film unfolded and I was pleasantly surprised how well how original it was on it's own and how true it was to the original film. It's funny without being forced or obnoxious, it unfolds at a healthy pace, the ""wacky"" aspects aren't overwrought. The ""science"" is mentioned a lot, but just enough to entertain, not make it seem too real.McCarthy is always hilarious. Wiig is understated and makes a great place for the audience to start. McKinnon could easily steal the movie with every smile and off-the-wall comment. And the beautiful Leslie Jones adds much needed every-man flavor with down-to-earth wonder. I especially loved the ways the film makes fun of the ""meninist"" man-babies who decried and all female cast. It pointed out their idiotic ideals without being preachy and it really added a lot of comedy foil. Chris Hemsworth playing the role of the man-baby and seeing the reactions of the cast to him was perfect.I am looking forward to the sequel!",Ghostbusters

Apparently I wasn't the only one who loved it because the theater was super crowded for a Tuesday, the audience actually broke out in applause and cheers during some parts, and of course lots and lots of laughter!I am glad that I decided to give the movie a chance and not listen to these people's reviews.

I was soon disappointed. Not nearly as creative as the first, was looking for a refreshed and updated version. But there was ZERO chemistry between the actresses, jokes were like 'ah, yeah'. I don't know who did the casting for this movie but not a good job in the selection of the actresses. There are so many funny gals out there who would have rocked in these rolls, but they chose some nobodies and some sorta funny talent like Kristin Wiig. What about Silverstone, what about Amy Poehler...etc Instead they looked under the comedy rug and swept out the cheapest talent they could throw together. WTF! Please try this again and get it right!

I don't want to give away any spoilers so I can't go into as much detail as I want to, but I will say the ending was probably the most obvious one I've seen to date. The cinematography wasn't as bad as some of my family members say. The people filming clearly new what they were doing and didn't put a million lense flares in the movie. The pretty good cinematography is what earned this film 1 star. The story wasn't new, and they didn't even try and revamp it besides the female characters.",Ghostbusters
2102,eridener,"A very entertaining ride, and a worthy successor to the original",8,20 July 2016,"Based on all the hate, I wasn't sure what to expect. When my partner and I went to see it, we were thoroughly enthralled. The characters are re-imaginings of the originals. The constant hitting on Kevin? Much like Venkman hitting on Dana, though less creepy, considering she wasn't packing a ton of Thorazine. The jokes for the most part landed well, though there were a few that didn't quite gel. I did wonder why, they trapped the one ghost, but later they just go on a straight up ghost murder spree. (compared to the original where they shove everything in a containment unit, kind of like ghost prison) The homages to the original were well done. The cameos were all pretty good. (Murray doing the same entrance/exit as he did in Zombieland) I would have loved the late Harold Ramis, or the retired Rick Moranis would have been great. Aykroyd's appearance in particular made us laugh. We joked he wasn't even acting there, since he is a huge paranormal buff.Anyways, it wasn't perfect, but it was very fun. Much better than Ghostbusters 2, and pretty close to the original.",Ghostbusters
2103,jingoro,Outstanding,9,20 July 2016,"Upon watching the trailer, I was skeptical. If not for a friend who is a big fan of the franchise, I might have skipped it until it was available via streaming.I'm very glad I went.The film is extraordinarily well done, each of the main roles delightfully rendered by an outstanding cast.I grew up with the original movies, iconic and quotable pieces of the pop culture of my childhood. I expected a ham-fisted attempt to shoehorn what we loved about the original in to a modern franchise reboot; a shameless money-grab.What I saw was not that at all. I saw a cast that was as in love with their characters and the premise of the film as the original cast was. I saw a story carefully crafted. Yes, the pacing is different, and no, it's not the same story, but there would have been no fun in a repeat of the past. This film picks a direction and revels in it. It takes the mantle of the original and rather than just trotting around in it, it makes it its own.If you're a fan of the originals, they're still out there for you to watch. This is the movie that will bring in new fans. New fans curious about the older films who will seek them out and compare and contrast not just the movies, but the cultures that created both.My only complaint was the soft target of the villain in this outing, but after a discussion with others, I find that another interesting point... they've detached the origin story and presented it on its own, and then hinted at taking on the original plot line in the next outing... an outing which will have its entire run time devoted to that plot line without having to stop for the origin story along the way.Let's just say I'm eagerly awaiting the sequel.Thank you to the cast and crew of Ghostbusters (2016), you surprised and delighted me.",Ghostbusters

Every single member of the cast was perfect and the chemistry among the core team was a delight to watch. Very impressed by Paul Feig and his team for creating a perfect summer blockbuster film. Funny without being convoluted and managed to ride that difficult line of ""feeling"" like the throwback without being the throwback.

The characters were nicely fleshed out, and the action was well paced. I loved the moments where my nostalgia was stroked, and all of the new bits were amazing as well. One of the friends who went with me, was concerned that the movie would be too much like Haunted Masion, he was very pleasantly surprised to find that it was not, and was in fact a great film. We also took my five year old daughter with us and she has decided to give up her dream of becoming a mermaid and instead would like to become an engineer who builds tools for fighting ghosts...since we saw it two days ago she has asked more than ten times if we can go see it again.

2106,orionblastar-82162,"Bad plot, bad acting, bad story, bad jokes, and empty seats",1,20 July 2016,"I don't like this movie due to other factors that are not that the Ghostbusters all had a gender flip, I think they could have made a good movie with all females in the lead rolls if they made it better.Instead the jokes had no punchlines and made no sense, there was some bad acting, the story was a 1984 Ghostbusters ripoff (sorry for that spoiler), the plot was bad because of the changes they made it to that made no sense. Like for example they get kicked out of that college and it doesn't show how they got an idea to do a business. Scenes that tell the story are missing apparently.There are a lot of empty seats as people refuse to go back and see the movie again. I'll give the movie 1 star because I can't give it 0 stars, but at least there wasn't enough people to have someone talking during the movie or taking their children to see it and the children scream when the ghosts show up etc. If you are a loaner who want to see a movie based on SJW and feminist propaganda then this is the movie for you.

2107,howes-56454,"Bland, Tasteless Mush",2,21 July 2016,"There are few, if any, redeeming qualities about this movie.The comedy is sub-par and relies heavily on toilet humor. The first recognizable joke in this movie is based off of two of the scientists (yes, they're supposed to be scientists) queefing into an EVP recorder and tricking Kristen Wiig into listening to it. I couldn't make this up if I tried.The only character I genuinely laughed at was Chris Hemsworth, who played the dim secretary hired by the Ghostbusters. Even then, all of the scripted dialogue he had was uncomfortably stiff and awkward, trying too hard to be funny. The few lines and things he clearly ad- libbed actually made me giggle, like putting his finger through the frame of his glasses to scratch his eye, revealing he didn't actually have any lenses.The story is generally messy and unappealing. Wiig, McCarthy and McKinnon all play scientists who team up to study the paranormal phenomena plaguing New York City. They travel to different locations and fight ghosts, slowly upgrading their tech, but plot points fall into their laps conveniently when needed and turn me off as a viewer. The big reveal of the twist occurs because the main villain was stupid enough to write down his plans and illustrate them in a copy he had of Wiig's character's book. Few of the characters were likable or even made sense. Jones' character joins the team because ??? reasons. She's good at navigating the city or something because she reads a lot of nonfiction and works in the subway. Her characters yells a lot. McCarthy and Wiig phone in their performances, and a lot of their laughs come from them being sprayed with vomit or being thrown around by an out-of-control proton pack. McKinnon's character has no personality beyond the stereotypical ""wacky scientist!1!"" and she seems like a cardboard cutout rather than a real character that we should feel emotion for. There is one brief scene at the end of the movie that tries to hint at the social awkwardness of her cinematographic predecessor (Egon played by the late Harold Ramis, R.I.P.), but there is no hinting at this up until this point in the film. She seems to be a zany, kooky weirdo until she gives a stunted, awkward toast at the end of the film that is supposed to...what? Imply awkwardness? Reveal a deep emotional core of a formerly strange and bizarre character? Show a sudden deeply felt friendship? I have no idea. It felt completely out of place in the movie.The actresses didn't mesh or work well with each other at all. Every scene felt awkward and yelly or like everyone was imitating everyone else's style of comedy, leaving a bland mush of a movie in its place.Overall, just a mediocre movie. And not fun-mediocre, like The Room or Twilight, where you can at least laugh at it enough to enjoy the badness.

I was so disappointed afterwards. The best parts were the cameos... which I wish had lasted longer because they were done by the only talented actors in the entire flick.

Most of the hate comments are coming from die- hard ghostbusters fans who expected something extremely spectacular. This is NOT a sequel, and it is not a REMAKE. It is a REBOOT. To be honest, it was way better than I expected. With all the hate it was getting, I was almost sure it wasn't going to be very good. I actually enjoyed it! I saw it three times! It wasn't overpowered by humor, although there was indeed a lot of it. There were some serious and suspenseful moments as well. Everything was balanced fairly well in my opinion, not to mention the incredible actresses who are in it too. It wasn't the BEST movie I have ever seen, but it definitely was far from being the worst. This isn't a sequel or a remake of any of the original movies. It has a totally different plot. There are many nostalgic moments and Easter eggs from the originals. The original cast is also in it too as cameos. The trailers make it look bad, but the trailers don't do it justice.

But my teenage daughter saw it last week and liked it so much she insisted we all see it tonight, so we went. For the first 15 minutes or so, my mind was having that interior conversation comparing and contrasting this model with the originals, then something odd happened... I was pulled in so completely that the critique stopped and I just enjoyed the show. The leading ladies were all appealing and worked well together. Who cares about the gender flip, really? Get over it folks. The nods to the original films were great with cameos from Aykroyd, Murray, Hudson, Weaver & Potts-- a shame Moranis passed on the offer -- not to mention Slimer. (I also see there's an actor named Ramis in the credits; Harold's son, I hope.) And while I'm not exactly the biggest rap aficionado, I did enjoy how the soundtrack often riffed off the original themes. For the whole last 90 minutes or so, I just smiled as I felt this reboot had done a splendid job of capturing the fun, rollicking spirit of the original.

My dad, who has encouraged me to pursue engineering all my life (lots of opportunities being a Hispanic woman), loves this idea. I will be taking my younger sister to see the film soon. I love Holtzman. She's weird and awkward and genuine. Another thing, this movie celebrates friendship. A friend mentioned to me that in group movies like this the group breaks up. Although at times you suspect this is going to inevitably happen, it doesn't. When things get rough, the girls stay together and work through things. This movie is a testament to how far Hollywood has advanced, though they still have a lot to work on. I know the world is kind of a mess right now.

2118,finalfantasymysticquest,It's Ghostbusters,9,23 July 2016,"This was such a fantastic movie! I can't put into words how much it means to me. That sequence where Kate McKinnon kills all those ghosts in slow-motion feels like how being 8 years old felt. How being 8 years old should've felt, would've felt if I ever had the chance to see someone like me on screen! Chris Hemsworth's character was a little bit useless and unnecessary in my opinion. They should've just taken him out of it entirely. But it was really funny to see the role reversal — in most movies, the girls are the incompetent eye candy while the men do all the work. And, as we all know, women do the hardest work in the world! Long story short, it was a great movie.",Ghostbusters

It made me so happy for a whole day and it was fresh, and new as much as a sequel can be. People complain about reusing the original material, but have you seen how many spiderman movies have been made?? From the same Peter Parker storyline? When there's plenty of alternative spider men and women to tell their stories. But about the film, I loved how different each of the characters were. Erin and her respectable ""real science"" arc, the backstory with the neighbour, how desperate she was to make people see the truth. Fell in love with Holtzmann. She's crazy and practical and chill, and incredibly clever. Patty was so different to the others, she brought the practical street level knowledge with her love of reading and human interaction. Abby and her passion for something no one credited for years. Chris Hemsworth proved he can do comedy here. He's the first male dumb blonde I've ever seen, which means there's no negative impact on blonde guys in the real world. It's not like he will become a common stereotype, holding back men from pursuing scientific careers...",Ghostbusters

He is by far the best character in the movie.Don't go see this, it's just a boring waste of money.Shame.The plot was rushed, and half of it either didn't make sense or was useless.They could've made a decent movie out of this and instead they rushed it, used poor jokes and churned out a mess.I was actually scared for a second in the start, the ghosts looked kind of scary.But it just didn't carry through, and therefore flopped Next movie should be a spin off with just Hemsworths character.Meh. Don't expect much of this movie.",Ghostbusters
2121,caitredding,Fun and funny - don't listen to the haters!,8,23 July 2016,"I honestly made an account purely so I could review this movie. I loved it. Was it a deep, complex plot? No. Was it fun and enjoyable to watch? Yes. All four women were hilarious to me in different ways, but Kate McKinnon should probably be in every movie - any time she was on screen I knew I'd be laughing. The movie had a simple plot, yes, but I was thoroughly entertained, and for a summer movie, it's exactly what I was looking for. What hurts me is all of the 1 star reviews. This didn't have to be your favorite movie by any means, but only 1 star?? Give it a little credit, don't just try to be dramatic. It seems like some people have a really hard time backing a movie with a mostly female cast and felt that the males were cast as ""dumb"" objects only there for their looks. If that doesn't feel right to you, perhaps you should look again how women are often portrayed as objects or dumb in media. It happens all. the. time.As for how it compares to the original, I find it best to not compare reboots like this to the first. I really enjoy the original, but this movie has it's own take on things while still being in the same ""universe"". It's like the new Planet of the Apes movies, the idea is there, but they are not trying to be a copy of the original, and both remain good movies in their different ways.The good thing about movie reviews is that they are all just someone else's opinion. Form an opinion for yourself - if the movie seems appealing to you, go see it. Be your own person with your own opinions. Mine is that I loved this movie and plan on seeing it again. Loved the cast, fun summer movie!",Ghostbusters
2122,klmkumquat,"Sweet, Fun, and Better Than Expected",8,23 July 2016,"Ghostbusters is a fun new take on the original, with a talented cast that play well of off each other. After reading bad reviews, I expected it to be flat, boring, and slapstick, but the movie is actually quite charming, and a refreshing action movie that takes women seriously. I grinned through the entire thing, and am seeing it again in theaters. Kate McKinnon steals the show, kicks ass, and is an inspiration to nerdy, off beat, awkward girls. I expected Leslie Jones' character to be a stereotypical mess of a sidekick, but was pleased to realize that her character was smart, sweet, and (spoiler) ends up saving the day. that being said, I think that her character should have been developed more, and that she wasn't the token woman of color. I wish that there was more development of the 4 women's friendship, as the relationship that they form feels genuine, but underdeveloped. The cameos from the original cast was super fun, and a subtle, but respectful nod at the source material. I don't ever write movie reviews, but I think that this is a sweet, fun, and empowering movie that's getting an undeserved amount of hatred.",Ghostbusters

Hope to see a GB2 as well :) and pay no attention to the so-called ghostheads that are posting those horrible messages... they're not true fans of the franchise (I don't believe that they're even fan of the original movie!).Thank you :) especially for the lovely hidden tribute to Harold Ramis, which really moved me :)",Ghostbusters
2124,suzbeaupre,Excellent film,10,23 July 2016,"Have been a fan of the originals for ages but actually enjoyed this reboot more! The jokes were constant and very funny, and the leads were excellent. Kate Mckinnon's character Jillian Holtzmann was a personal favourite There was an excellent balance between the scary/suspenseful elements and the comic, which kept up the tension. The slower moments provided useful backstory for the lead characters which I am hoping will be used in sequels. Chris Hemsworth obviously enjoyed his role, and it is lovely to watch someone enjoying themselves so much. I was not fully convinced by the trailer but they had saved all the best moments for the film, making it a very worth while cinema trip. There were the expected cameos - Bill Murray with a larger role, but a very nice one from Dan Ackroyd, showing that the original cast obviously had fun with this reboot as well. I am very much looking forward to repeat viewings.",Ghostbusters
2125,drmzander,Super cute,8,23 July 2016,"Super cute movie! Much better than the 2nd original ghostbusters. Loved the chemistry among the cast and all of the throwbacks to the original movie and cast. Also, I appreciated the gender role switches, which shed light on a long history of stereotyped female/male roles. I also liked that there were no lame love stories that detract from the plot. I thought the first ghostbusters movies were a little stilted in that department. I thought the cameos of the original cast were well timed and thoughtful. The music was very fun. There were some random dancing scenes, which were a little bizarre. Overall, I would definitely like to watch the movie again! Great addition to my traditional Halloween film selections.",Ghostbusters

So much better than the pets or dory movie I had also had to sit through this summer. we will be seeing this again with the nieces next weekend and I am looking forward to it this time. The theatre was packed with a healthy mix of adults and older kids, everybody seemed to really enjoy it, so it gets an easy recommendation as having general age appeal for a group movie. Special mention: It was nice to see Bill Murray, he never gets old, as the saying goes. Same for the other original cast member cameos. and fans of the original will have fun with the abundance of Easter eggs sprinkled throughout the movie- surprising how many the kids picked up!",Ghostbusters
2127,saraalb,Genuinely funnier than the original,9,24 July 2016,"Like a lot of people, I chose to ignore the (mostly negative) hype surrounding this movie and draw my own judgments once it came out. I can honestly say that I found this movie much funnier (and better in pretty much every way) than the original. Kate McKinnon and Leslie Jones steal the show, with some of the best lines in the film. There are a ton of cameos and Easter eggs for people who have seen the original movies to appreciate. The movie is cheesy and silly in the way the 1984 version was, with CGI that mimics the 80s special effects (worth noting here because I keep seeing other reviewers complaining about how ""bad"" the CGI was. If you'd actually seen the original which you claim to uphold like the bible itself then you'd recognize that it's done on purpose). As for those calling this movie ""man-hating,"" that comment literally has no merit whatsoever. Yes, the main villain is a man, but plenty of other movies have male villains, so... And yes, Chris Hemsworth's character is the embodiment of the ""dumb blonde"" trope (a trope, you'll notice, that is typically reserved for women), but it is expressed throughout the movie how much the women genuinely care about him and appreciate him as part of the team, despite his incompetence as their receptionist.All in all, it's a great movie. I saw it twice. Everyone I went with loved it. Don't believe the negative reviews. Go see it for yourself and draw your own conclusions.",Ghostbusters
2128,dmmagius,Why so much misogynistic hate ???,7,25 July 2016,"Why has there been so much misogynistic hate lately, and for this movie in particular? I saw how the trailers for this movie were brutally slammed and, like I do most of the time, decided to form my own opinion after seeing the movie. I went with my father and my wife this past weekend and found it quite enjoyable. All three of us were laughing wholeheartedly throughout most of the movie. I enjoyed the fact that it wasn't a straight redo of the original 1984 classic and tend to think of it as an alternate universe version of the Ghostbusters. Loved the cameo appearances by almost all of the major characters from the original. Found most of the movie to be quite humorous. About the only thing that I didn't enjoy was just how idiotic they decided to make Chris Hemsworth's character Kevin. So far, I have to say that Holtzmann has got to be my favorite character - there's just something about her over-the- top insane genius mad scientist that I love.Is it as good as the original? In my humble opinion - no but pretty close. A good part of the humor of this movie relies on callbacks to the original movie itself and without the original, it would fall a little flat. A remake like this needs to pander a little to the fans of the original. Does that make it a bad movie? No, it doesn't.Long story short - don't listen to the hate. Go see this movie and form your own opinions. I did so and found it quite enjoyable and amusing.",Ghostbusters

It inspired actual applause from basically the entire theater. The characters are well developed, with clear and compelling motivations. The jokes are genuinely funny and don't ever punch down -- no cheap fat jokes or racist jokes. The women behave like actual people instead of like stick figures with guns.

Leslie Jones was funny, Kate McKinnon was hilarious, Melissa McCarthy was terrific, Kristen Wiig was hysterical, but more importantly the rest of the cast was awesome! It wasn't all about them, it was about the villain, it was about Kevin, even Andy Garcia had a great screaming match with a Jaws reference was had us adults cracking up.

The jokes are cute, the spooky parts are spooky, the human side of the characters glints through, and it's just overall a great movie. I wasn't sure what to expect for the jokes as I'm not a big fan of the current trend of the humour in comedies with female leads, but I truly loved this movie.While watching it, my heart was breaking a bit thinking about all of the trash that had been thrown at it, just because it was a girl movie. These ladies did an amazing job, the writing was right where I would want it, the characters and their development was fresh... I can't complain. It was nice to see women portrayed as women and not caricatures or where their sexuality plays the lead role, not the personality.

2132,evfitl,Who are you going to telephone?... Mike Hat!,8,24 July 2016,"I shall preface this with a few points. I loved the original Ghostbusters, and like many people here it was a huge part of my childhood. I grew up with it as well as the cartoons. If people where to ask me what my favourite movie of all time was it would be Ghostbusters. Here we are in 2016 and the moment that all Ghostheads have been waiting for has arrived a new 21st century Ghostbusters, after many years of speculation it has finally happened. But by god the nerd rage is strong in this one and i've lived through Star Wars prequels, and Star Trek reboots. The movie brought a smile to my angry jaded face. I went in with the lowest possible expectations like I always do, especially with reboots. and here is something that all you haters going to hate. The movie was really really good. Please if you're reading this review ignore the small minded idiots who believe that Paul Feig invented the time machine and single-handedly violated their childhoods. It's all pure and unadulterated butt hurt from people angry they never got to see a proper Ghostbusters 3 with the original cast. Now I have that aside (and without spoilers) I will attempt to tell you why it is good. Ignore all the comments of racism, feminism, bad CGI, Bad Acting, bad characters (infact I think most of the top bad reviews slate everything). All of this is irrelevant, its again simply very angry fans of the original film who want to pull everything and anything apart that they possibly can.The film is an enjoyable romp, that treats the franchise with respect whilst bringing it up to date. The story is a more fleshed out variation on the original film. The characters work well together and the effects are spot on . Acting is a little stilted in places, but overall well done. There are even a few little scary creepy bits in it for good measure. It caters for the fans by having the little nods and cameos here and there, to make the fan smile. Overall it is a job well done and a thumbs up from the most jaded moviegoer out there who usually hates most reboots/rehashing of old IP. I for one am looking forward to what this updated franchise is going to come up with over the coming years. I write this review simply to try and redress the balance, ignore the naysayers and the rage, you're right, you're a Ghosthead and your beloved franchise is back in town. Who are you going to telephone?... Mike Hat!NB: Nobody paid me for this review.",Ghostbusters
2133,zarkul,Light comedy with breakout Hemsworth role,4,24 July 2016,"This film isn't awful, it's just a mediocre light comedy reboot of what was a male-dominated franchise refashioned as a wannabe female-dominated one. The ending credits definitely set things up for a potential sequel. Hemsworth steals the show from the ladies and is hilarious in what is for him a breakout role. To the film powers that be: please do Hemsworth and film goers a favor and cast him in more comedies. He has the acting chops to be a great success in them. This is a another miss for the great Melissa McCarthy. Let's hope she has more success finding vehicles worthy of her talents in the future. The rest of the leading ladies were 'meh.' Kristen Wiig continues to disappoint, despite being attractive, quirkily funny, and with so much potential. The lady has limited range and depth and yet again, doesn't deliver.",Ghostbusters

Loved the cameos from the original cast too. Its a movie about Ghostsbusting, not a Shakespearean tragedy.I went with my family, we all laughed...I do think the first half of the movie was the best. Its a silly movie and we had fun. I checked my preconceived notions at the ticket window and went in hoping for the best, and it was better than I expected.Sure the original movie is a classic and can't be beat, but I teared up as the credits rolled and the movie was dedicated to Harold Ramis...he would be proud I think.

There were cameos from former Ghostbusters cast members, but they weren't overdone. The 'science' of the story line is fake, and was fake in the first movie-- I don't know why anyone would expect to walk into a movie ABOUT GHOSTS and not think there will be some suspension of disbelief required, but whatever.

The cameos by the original cast were great, the effects were AMAZING, the comedy was excellent, the story was solid (even more so than the first 2 actually) and the prospect of sequels is wide open! Even the credits and musical score were really good! Give it a chance, and ignore the worthless trolls.

2138,chrsmith-95912,Fun filled but not perfect,8,25 July 2016,"Sadly i feel like i must first address the elephant in the room. This movie has been heavily slandered before it was even made due to the inclusion of an all female main cast. This is by far one of the dumbest things to hate about a movie i have ever heard, but whats even worse is that its part of this at all. It should not matter what the gender of the characters are (TO ANYONE,including some of the advocates), what matters most is the content of the film and the context in which it is presented. That being said my only real worry was that the shift from the original would could possibly lead the filmmakers to change the overall dynamic of the movie. To that end i am relieved to say that they did not. While standing very well as its own movie it managed to stay very true to the feel of the original. The strong bond of shared purpose resonated just as strongly with the new cast as much as it did the old. Aside from the main cast the comedy was very well written, although it did stumble (sometimes hard) in a few places. Sometimes the tone slipped into being a little too cartoonish and probably wont sit well with some of the more grown up viewers. When all is said and done my best advice to people is to go into this movie with all bias left at the door and i believe they will be surprised with what they find.P.S. To all of you woman hating men out there, JUST STOP TALKING! You're giving the rest of us a bad name!",Ghostbusters

Kate McKinnon should star in an action movie and Chris Hemsworth another comedy. It was a fun, action packed, goofy, scary, entertaining movie; much like the original.

The switching of gender roles didn't ruin the film in anyway, it provided funny and smart role models to young girls. It follows almost the exact same story line as the original and there are many subtle references that are subtle enough so that people who haven't watched the originals will still understand and not miss out. It was a hilarious adaption from the original movie and it was honestly incredible. People who are opposed to this movie are generally people who are relatively sexist and ones who are annoyed about the dumb male secretary are now experiencing how girls feel when the usually sexualised receptionist is what they are shown. It provides bad-ass role models and it shows that you don't have to be a guy in order to be awesome.",Ghostbusters

I loved this movie, I saw it at a drive in, which compounded the feelings of nostalgia mixed with something new and fresh. The gender role reversal was brilliant, the jokes were funny for the most part, with Holtzmann stealing the show. The dumb guy was also a brilliant touch, we don't usually see that, and it was so refreshing to see the trope turned on its head. So, sorry man-babies, sorry that a movie hurt you in your nostalgia feels, but we are going to get movies aimed towards us and you don't have to like it, but you are going to have to learn to deal with it.",Ghostbusters

Where the original felt like a serious film with comedy driven by the character of the Ghostbusters and the cool, wisecracking way they dealt with the threat, this feels like a random set of jokes have been thrown together which don't advance the narrative. Whereas the original was loved by adults and children alike, I feel much of this humour misses the mark for adults and from the response of other movie goers at the screening I attended it appears they had the same reaction.I would have given this a 3, but for the tack Sony marketing has taken by repeatedly accusing anyone who criticised the material aired in the trailers.1/10, shame I couldn't make it a 0.",Ghostbusters
2143,joellindberg-36448,A Giant Mess,2,25 July 2016,"Earlier today I survived 18 years of confusion and stress to celebrate this special day, my 18th birthday. The day of surprise and maturity that every teenager looks forward to. As I go on throughout this day I decide to use my new privilege to purchase a lottery ticket. My expectations were low but I am full of hope and confidence. I put in dollar after dollar to get a lottery ticket and slowly scratch off the numbers until I find a barren wasteland of unmatched numbers. I sit there with disappointment as I wasted $5 on false hope. But this feeling doesn't compare at all to the agony I was about to experience as I watch the new Ghostbusters. The story involves 4 smart but quirky women with mutual interest in science and the paranormal. Also starring the dumb but hunky receptionist Chris Hemsworth to show how gender stereotypes play into our modern culture and cinema. But much like a sex ed class, their point couldn't get across without uncomfortable humor and many awkward silences. The lead characters make up for this by being loud and dominant rather than expressing genuine humor or having insightful dialogue.It was also ironic how the movie showed how women can look at men for their attractiveness and disregard their intellect and personality.Although this was meant to be a feminist movie, it was very ironic that the entire movie was based another film but poorly done. This movie was about as beneficial to the feminist movement as communism was to Russia. Sure there were good intentions, but the end result was a disaster. Executed so poorly that it puts a middle school Willy Wonka play to shame. After finishing this movie, the disappointment I experiences scratching my lottery ticket turned into relief. Relief that although I lost $5 to a scratch ticket with low expectations, it is nothing compared to the $8 I wasted on Ghostbusters. A disappointment so bad that it makes Jaden Smith seem like an idol.",Ghostbusters

I had fun watching it, I didn't think it was 'a sexist man-hating mess that only appeals to radical feminists'. Let me guess, you're also the same kind of person as the ones that are harassing the actresses on twitter right??Like any movie there were jokes that I found funny and ones that just flopped, but I didn't go in there expecting to laugh at every joke. But I still had a fun time seeing it, because A) I didn't go into the theater expecting a movie on the same level of terrible as the Last Airbender live action movie. B) I wasn't being a pissy baby about how 'wahh wahh they made all the ghostbusters ladies wahh wahh feminist garbage'The movie wasn't amazing, of course. I liked the actresses and their performances but the movie's script obviously wasn't perfect and there were quite a few things that had me thinking 'deus ex machina'. The CG was a bit over the top at times, I do wish they would have followed in the footsteps of the old Ghostbusters in using some more practical affects. They didn't really attempt much new things, besides the obvious casting differences, which is a bit disappointing but not overall unexpected. I haven't known any movie remake to try anything that hasn't already succeeded, so I can still commend this movie for doing something different with the cast at least.",Ghostbusters
2145,parryavril,A refreshing comedy,10,26 July 2016,"This movie does not deserve all the hate it's been getting. It was genuinely funny and refreshing. I see a lot of people getting butt hurt about how the jokes aren't funny, but they are to the audience that this movie is pertaining to: women. Not only do we see all the main roles of the movie filled by women, but we get to see a refreshing flip of the blond, bimbo stereotype filled by Chris Hemsworth. I don't see this movie as sexist at all. Actually, there is a certain fondness for the blonde bimbo (Kevin) typically seen towards overly sexualized women in other movies. I don't see this movie doing anything more sexist in other comedies where women are just lusted after and don't have a real purpose. Actually, the main reason this movie is so refreshing is we get to see women whose purpose is greater than getting over a breakup, finding a man, finding love, etc. We see women as real people, not just as minor characters or objects of lust and that is what I really love about this reboot.",Ghostbusters

I did not mind the idea of an all female cast, I honestly thought ""Hell yeah, I would love to see some women kick some butt"". All I got was a a group of women that had no chemistry together, a few one liners (not funny ones either) and bad graphics. Do not waste your time. Just go watch the old ones and pretend this one didn't happen. I made this account just to review this movie. That should say something, so should all the one star reviews on here as well. I cant believe I have to say 10 lines about this awful movie, this movie isn't even worth talking about in one line let alone 10 of them. Just stay away, far away and if it gets close to you, kill it with fire.",Ghostbusters
2147,brianc-39630,Really Enjoyed It!,10,29 July 2016,"I think this movie was great. The little ""Easter Eggs"" hidden throughout and cameos are pretty awesome too. I think when you really have an open-mind you go into a movie with a fresh pallet ready to soak in cinematic awesomeness. Ghostbusters delivered on all levels and the relationship you see them build is so wonderful. I am a big fan of films with leading women and these four have such great energy. I think some reviewers are just douche guys and are mad that there are women. Really great story line and I wish there would be a second. It was action packed and the humor was spot on. So nice to see seniors Kristen and Melissa with Kate and Leslie. Can't describe how awesome the chemistry is.",Ghostbusters
2148,rainhall,This movie's fine.,7,27 July 2016,"Ghostbusters is an action-comedy. The plot exists as a vehicle for jokes and explosions, just as in the original. We didn't go see the original to be enlightened about the our place in the universe. I had a good time and got my money's worth. If you want something light and fun, you should go see it.Some of the criticisms I've seen in other reviews don't hold up. Some say it just ripped off the original. Um, didja SEE The Force Awakens? Did you give that one star too?Some of my fellow dudes say Chris Hemsworth's character is insulting to men. It didn't insult me, but hey, I'm pretty good at answering a phone. Maybe you have some telecommunications insecurities?Some say the CG was bad. I never noticed it once. Are you just looking for parts of the movie you haven't complained about yet?So a bunch of people rated this movie one star. You, my friends, never paid full price to see Richard Moll in The Dungeon Master. If someone doesn't like this movie because it's action fluff without much gravity, I would get that, but it's not competing with the worst movies ever made.",Ghostbusters
2149,katalinseiner,"Its not that bad, if you understand the sarcasm...",7,27 July 2016,"I finally get to see this movie. I read a lot of reviews here, and other places and, just like some, I have no idea why people are dissing this movie so much. I grew up on Ghostbusters and the comedy genius that was the 80s in general. I think a lot of people feel like that you cannot redo a classic. Well, that is wrong. Besides, this is not a remake, this is a reboot. And as far as I can see, it's a decent reboot at that. The acting was completely fine, although I did wish that Kate McKinnon had made a less quirky approach to the character, and I felt that perhaps Kevin was slightly overdone. That said, I think many miss the obvious jab at stereotyping in general. Many have commented that Patty (Leslie Jones) is a stereotyped African-American character with her street smarts. Personally, I think, yes, you are right (if you don't know Leslie Jones from other performances), but she was not really in any disadvantage because of it as a character. If you haves seen Leslie Jones in Saturday Night Live, then you know that her characterization is always loud and aggressive. That's her style, and she brought her style to the character. Besides, you could say, that Erin was also stereotyped as an academic with her slightly repressed personality and librarian outfit. When it comes to the characters of Erin (Kristen Wiig) and Abby (Melissa McCarthy), I think they were pretty mellow, which brought balance into the team as a whole. Returning to the jab at stereotyping. Kevin's character was made just for that. The 80s were full of blond bimbos, and I think remaking that as a male character was right on the money. It is blunt sarcasm. The same thing reflects on the four women vs the four men team. I mean we could rightly ask, why there were four men in the original casting of the Ghostbusters? Perhaps there was no back thought for that at all back then, but none the less, it is, inadvertently a reflection of the chauvinism that we should have left behind in the beginning of the 90s. The CGI was perfectly fine, even though I thought the action choreography could have used some work, and personally I had no love for the ""Final Ghost"" (Not going to say more because SPOILERS!). But well, I did watch it for the comedy and the story, not the CGI.Finally, I think the Paul Feigh - Melissa McCarthy duo has done what they always have since Bridesmaids, comedy for this decades humor, and in that sense, they did not disappoint. After all, this is exactly what Ivan Reitman did in the 80s.",Ghostbusters
2150,feid-03967,Awful movie,1,27 July 2016,"I had to create an account to review this movie. It's a horrible movie. I didn't expect a Dumb&Dumber style, at all for this kind of movie. Especially when you consider how many dozen millions of dollars were put into it's making. It's bad on many point.Plot: A bunch of girls assemble to fight a dude that makes ghosts materialize in real world thanks to the knowledge inside a book 2 these girls wrote a while back.The characters are all clichés: -The funny fat lady, incapable of anything by herself. She takes nothing seriously and does too many idiotic things (that proton pack testing?), say too much useless jokes that are not even smart jokes. I can't even remember them. She's very annoying. -The ""good girl"" scientist, unsure of everything. So empty that there is nothing to say. -The ""Black street-smart girl"" cliché... Why??????? I mean, they could have brought a black girl into the crew without keeping her at that kind of lame-ass cliché. I'm angry about this one. -The ""steampunk"" girl cliché. Over-confident and so on. The less annoying character IMO but she over-did it anyway. -and the ""low IQ good looking guy"" secretary with a plot use. I can't begin to think to a justification to that almost full retard character but more useless jokes ?On themselves these characters are bad clichés already. But you have to consider it as a re-shake of the old characters. Which makes it worse the longer you think about it. The way the team assembles is also really really bad. For one, it'd never had assembled if the ""villain"" had not existed. This movies suffers from too much quantumic-mumbo-jumbo-unnecessary explanations that don't serve any purpose in the story. Probably for selling toys on Christmas. Very very bad characters. Not one of them seems ""real"" enough to dive into the movie. Too much dull jokes. I mean, really, too much. More than 1 joke a minute. I could even say that almost 90% of dialogues are bad jokes. Too cartoonish CGIs. Very very bad plot.This movie is a succession of flat jokes sprinkled with bad CGIs that no ""plot"" or acting could make interesting. It's just a fact. If there had not been so much jokes and useless explanations on things that don't matter maybe the story would have been better. They tried to remake 2 GB in one, but without the substance... And more. I don't see any reason why any person older than 12 would enjoy that crap. GB 2016 is not at all the same kind of genre than original GB and that's probably what grinds it all.I'd rather watch Dragon Ball Evolution again than watch GB 2016 one more time.",Ghostbusters
2151,snailnslug,Are you serious??,1,27 July 2016,"My date picked this movie. She decided we needed to leave mid way. She loved the old classic Ghost busters and it was totally awful! Nothing more needs to be said. We Watch all the old classic Sci fi flix, including all the new releases. A plus note on this awful movie, is 1. We were able to talk about it at length (Laughing more like it). 2. We went home and watched the original Aliens ""Director's cut"". She has never seen the scene where the auto Turrets plow through the aliens and start running out of ammo. 3. The movie ended when we left the theater. Its so bad I logged on IMDb which I don't think I have in 10 or more years?? Also I believe the industry or at least the commercials were lying to everyone. They must be forcing their ideas on man kind. I don't take to those types of lies kindly. I will watch the Superman vs. Batman next and a few other sci fi flix. I wouldn't even rent this via Amazon prime or whatever you use.",Ghostbusters
2152,scisna,Anybody who says this is a good movie is either a shill or has never seen the original,2,27 July 2016,"This was really pretty bad. There's just no other way to put it.I will say, though, that when I saw it in the theater, everybody else seemed to like it. And not just a little bit. They were cracking up.But, then, the people in the theater where I saw it cheered at stupid things like Dan Aykroyd's cameo, where he said ""I ain't afraid of no ghosts!"".I mean, how do you respond to that? Some people are really easily impressed. There are lots of dumb people in the world, and it's nice that there are things out there for them to enjoy. So, in a way, I kind of feel bad for picking on this movie. But screw it. I grew up with Ghostbusters. I still have it basically memorized from watching it so much when I was a kid. I even have the ""edited for television"" version I taped off of TV, where they replaced the swear words with other bits of dialog memorized. So criticize I shall!Some of the jokes were funny, I guess. Most of them really weren't. A lot of them just went on and on, long past the point at which they were funny. Like the whole ""cat out of the bag"" discussion.You know that thing in movies people do sometimes? Where they plan to do something in unison, but they screw it up, and then look confused and point at each other and say ""Oh, were you...?"" ""No, I guess we...?"" ""So now we're gonna...?"" for a few seconds? They did that at least THREE TIMES in the movie.Do you think that's funny? Do you think it's funny to see it three times in one movie? If so, Ghostbusters 2016 is the movie for you.I see professional reviewers who say that this captures the spirit of the original Ghostbusters. This is a lie. A flat-out, bald- faced lie. I don't know if Sony Pictures paid them to say that, or they were just too jazzed up about the whole ""grrl power"" thing or what, but it's a lie.Here's the problem. The original Ghostbusters wasn't really a comedy. Sure, there were funny parts in it, but it was really just an action fantasy movie. There are whole stretches of the film where nobody says anything that's even intended to be funny.This was just a cartoon show. It was more cartoonish than the actual Ghostbusters cartoon.Couple of examples. Chris Helmsworth, the secretary. He's dumb. You know how you know he's dumb? Because every second he spends on camera is a reminder that he's dumb.But I don't mean dumb the way that, say, a dumb person is dumb. Oh no. This guy is dumber than that.At one point, he hears a loud noise, and covers up his eyes. That's how dumb his character is supposed to be. Babies know that you hear with your ears, but not this character! That's how dumb he is!At one point, he tries to reach into an aquarium to try to get at a phone that's in there. Hand hits glass. He tries again. Hand hits glass again. He tries again.Another time, he shows a picture of him ""listening to a saxophone"", by which, he means holding a saxophone up to his ear, with nobody playing it. So, he learned how his ears work, but not saxophones.Why does this matter? Because NONE of this movie seemed real. I just didn't CARE if the apocalypse happened, because this didn't bear any resemblance to the real world. I didn't feel like there was anything at stake.The original Ghostbusters movie was about a supernatural event that happened to realistic characters, and they responded in realistic ways. They were eccentric, but still recognizable as human. The exception would be Lewis, but if there's just one guy acting like that, you can believe that he's just sort of odd.By contrast, in this movie, someone has to explain to the mayor of New York City that a woman didn't really get sawed in half during a magic show.Do you see the difference?Oh, and there's a really dumb scene at a heavy metal concert, with a fake band that isn't very good, and a crowd of people behaving in a way no crowd of people have ever acted!And then Ozzy Osbourne comes out and breaks the fourth wall! Someone, somewhere must have found that funny! I can't imagine who, but then, who am I? Just someone who spent money on this thing.So, in conclusion. You might like this. You might not. I have to admit, I went into it thinking it looked pretty bad. I TRY not to be negative, though, and I TRY to give things a chance, but... I don't know. I don't see how I could ever have liked this movie. I don't know who could. A lot of people seem to, though. So maybe I'm just getting cranky in my old age. Maybe everyone else is just stupid. It's hard to say.That blonde woman was really annoying too. There was a scene of her dancing around to that song ""Rhythm Of The Night"" setting things on fire with a couple of gas torches. Not for any reason, mind you. Just to show the audience that she's ""wacky"". She spends the entire movie being ""wacky"". The kind of ""wacky"" that gets old really fast.",Ghostbusters
2153,rottt,"My entire family enjoyed this, my teenage boys loved it",10,28 July 2016,"I was very hesitant to go to the theater to see this based on all the bad reviews. I grew up with Ghostbusters and the original movies hold a special place in my heart and always will. I love Egon, always. I base a lot of my decisions on user reviews and it's always been close to my own opinions. This is the first movie I can remember going to see with incredibly low expectations and really being shocked. I loved the movie, laughed through the entire movie. I have seen so many movies that people put political correctness and all kinds of stuff into opinions. Tons of movies with men in the lead get torn apart for insensitivity or too many penis jokes or having dumb women around. I enjoy those movies and don't take that stuff too seriously. Let guys be guys, leave them alone. They are having fun have fun with them. I feel the same here, the girls are being girls, have fun with them and don't be so serious. This movie didn't replace our beloved characters, thank God. It gave us new ones to love right along with the old ones. The movie was very respectful to the original in many ways. It didn't try to be a remake, it rebooted the movie for a new generation. I think it did it very well considering how loved the franchise is by so many people. I thought the story was easy to follow and stayed true to its roots. The humor flowed through the entire movie and the trailers didn't do the movie justice. It was funnier then I would have expected. I even enjoyed the CGI, it was done with a fun cartoony way that added to the lighthearted vibe the movie was trying to project. My boys and husband giggled through the entire movie, busted out laughing at times. We went to be entertained and we were. We are not easily offended types and we don't look at movies to represent reality. If you are tired of being spoon fed by Internet trolls telling you what you should and should not enjoy, give this movie a try, have fun with it. It's Ghostbusters on the big screen again! Thank you Paul Feig and your cast and crew for giving us a new Ghostbusters movie, I for one have been waiting for years to see it. I wasn't disappointed and I want to support you so I get to see more. This movie had a lot of pressure on it and you made me reminisce and laugh, and that's pretty darn cool.",Ghostbusters
2154,davidaspinall,"Loved the original. Second time around, same but different.",7,28 July 2016,"In 1984, I was the last of my group of friends to see Ghostbusters. Against a backdrop of critical comments, I found it to be probably my favourite movie experience ever. The new Ghostbusters movie was heralded by many as a reboot of the same story-line, I find that hard to agree with as the basic story-line (don't think this is a spoiler) ie catching ghosts is the same, the manner in which the story builds up to that is not. A darker scarier film, but to counteract that more 'laugh out loud' moments. Hilarious performances especially 'Abby', 'Holtzmann' super tech. Kristen Wiig as 'Erin' a straight to Abby's zany passion, not sure her character fully worked for me. That and the fact it was a rebooted concept prevents me awarding any higher. However they have achieved a new story-line in 'old wrapping'. PS Stay to the very end of the titles, it is worth it.",Ghostbusters
2155,jeremyhicks-90558,Loads of fun!,8,28 July 2016,"Short version: SO much better than I expected. Went in a skeptic, came out converted. Encouraging everyone I know to see it. Dying for a sequel. Long version: Everything you could want from a Ghostbusters reboot is here (REBOOT, not sequel, is the operative word)- funny banter, cool new gadgets, creative ghost designs that toe the horror/comedy line nicely, awesome action scenes, a well-paced story that DOESN'T completely retread the original (looking at you, Ghostbusters 2), and most importantly, four bada** ghost-hunting characters that are hilarious and even a little compelling when combined. After thirty years of waiting, I ate it up from start to finish.That said, I can admit it was deeply flawed. While most of the jokes hit, the ones that miss REALLY die. Also, every scene with Kevin made me cringe- I get the feeling they were trying to use him to make a point but he was SO over the top I can't begin to tell you what it was. Finally, I loved most of the OG GB cameos, but a couple of them did feel a little forced. Still, taken as a whole, it was a solid, above-average piece of entertainment. After this summer's generally morose superhero offerings, a campy, action-packed foray into the land of the undead is just what I needed. Give it a chance, you'll be glad you did.",Ghostbusters

Because metal songs and ghosts and fire are ridiculously awesome to mix.Then the characters. They're incredible women with their differences. But they're loyal, adaptable, funny and strong. Patty's work in the train station might be boring, but she's still cheerful about it. Erin is ambitious, but she loves her friendship and she does things to prove people that she can do things much better. Jillian is crazy (and hot). While Abby is strongwilled woman. They're such amazing characters with their quirks and flaws. They're the kind of women for little girls to look up to.Chris Hemsworth as eyecandy though. That, is how women usually treated in movies. But now we get the reverse. Thanks so much for Chris Hemsworth for doing this (and the dance, of course).This movie is glorious.However I understand why some boys don't like this movie, they're butthurt about it (which is another plus in my dictionary).",Ghostbusters

This remake of Ghostbusters made me laugh a lot, and I liked the all the characters. The ghosts felt much more dangerous than they did in the original two Ghostbusters films, with the help of great updated special effects in comparison to the original. The new weapons are also a great addition really expending the possibilities for new merchandising for the franchise. The credits are really entertaining, and there was an Easter egg waiting for fans of the original movie at the very end. Can't wait for the sequel! =)",Ghostbusters
2158,belleholder,"Badass, needs better editing",9,28 July 2016,"The new Ghostbusters movie is different, bad-ass, and hysterical. The script needed more editing, and Melissa McCarthy plays another two dimensional character, but the backstory behind Kristin Wiig's character and everything Kate McKinnon does make up for it. The comedy is a bit drawn out, as that is the existing dynamic between the four comedians(so those who love their work on SNL will find it familiar and have no issue), but still funny. Plus, everything that Leslie Jones says is perfection.If you are looking for a clone of Ghostbusters with women, you won't find it. If you are looking for a fun and empowering movie featuring fight scenes with ghosts involving proton whips and one liners, this is it. Dialogue- 7/10 for excessive conversations and bursts of bad writing Fighting- 10/10 for proton whip Humor- 9/10 because I hate fart jokes Length- 8/10 for the irrelevance of Wiig's entire tenure plot line Legacy- 10/10 for being a different film from the old Ghostbusters series, and for having perfect cameos of the old cast. Overall- 9/10 I think the sequel will be better- I almost feel as though much of the writing for this film was stunted by writers afraid of the Ghostbusters mob coming after them, but their decision to change things up while still being true to what Ghostbusters original is about gives them a good foundation. Since my major issue was with the writing and editing (something they can fix by firing whoever was responsible for the entire scene with the mayor) I have high hopes.",Ghostbusters

I can't call it a remake because the plot, while similar, was different and enjoyably so. I really had a fun time with this movie.Maybe it is because I am the type of person who can watch a movie at face value and not place an over-emphatic amount of weight on ""social commentary"" in a movie or see hidden meaning behind casting choices, but I prefer to think of the reason for my enjoyment being that the movie, as a whole, is enjoyable.The cast consists of four very funny women who, while more backstory or chemistry could have been built between them, work well together and it's honestly refreshing to see Chris Hemsworth in a comedic role instead of just a muscle-bound action hero. A very enjoyable change of pace for him.I wonder about the people who say the CGI was bad because I think they must all be from another plane of existence where Pokemon run about the world in reality or something. The CGI was more than acceptable and while maybe not groundbreaking, was certainly not poor.Following there may be some spoilers, but if so they are gentle, and I don't think it'll ruin anything, however if you prefer to walk into it blind, then maybe stop reading now.Cameo appearances in the movie were all very good. I enjoyed seeing every one of them, though I did wonder where Rick Moranis was. Even the Stay-Puft cameo is done well and with a lot of hilarity, in my opinion.The final action sequence is just that - action. They stepped out of the comedy role long enough to put in a bit of real ""busting"" and it worked at that point of the movie.Yes, I know as well that the ""crotch shot"" on the ""big baddie"" was maybe cheap humor, but I found it funny - not emasculating - as I did the all-female-lead cast.Despite what others have said in their reviews, the four women aren't pinned as frauds but in fact recognized for their work, albeit secretly.I don't know what other reviewers have against this movie. As I said, I was at first reserved, but only because when you are rebooting a classic franchise, you must be careful. The reboot works and works well.I recently heard somewhere that for some reason, people think when something is rebooted, it ""damages"" the original product or ruins it. I don't know where this culture came from either, but I will say this about Ghostbusters 2016 to round out this review. It isn't a perfect movie, but it is entertaining, funny, well-acted, and worth seeing on a big screen - not necessarily 3D, but just the big screen.I hope you see it and enjoy it for what it is and stop trying to make it what it isn't.",Ghostbusters

And even though I deeply love both Mell M & Kristen W. remakes are becoming the 3rd American Pie the Wedding, which of course was terrible. This Ghostbusters was highly anticipated by me as I LOVE all the originals and I like most of the casts past movies.Unfortunately the best parts for me were the guest appearances from the original cast - like Bill M, Ernie H & Annie P.This movie is a decent watch, out of the Cinema or if you're in your 20's and never seen the original.Ghostbusters in 1984, however poor in technical and visual appearance, will always be a fave of mine.But I do plead that NO-ONE and I mean NO-ONE, EVER, EVER try and do a remake of The Goonies as you will fail.

Now he would be listed as a stalker and probably have several sexual misconduct suits on file. That always made me highly uncomfortable in the old movie and it really distracted from the plot. This movie.... It really was mostly all action. The iffy part was the use of the ""pretty but dumb as a bag of bricks"" receptionist was a bit groan worthy. It was great to see some of the original cast in their cameo spots. The CGI... was okay but probably not award winning but in no way distracts from the fun of this movie. As I saw the original when it came out and being an adult at the time, it always seemed slow passed and the sleeze factor always set me off. With this cast it was refreshingly funny.

There is no talk about clothes (other than the jumpsuits), and there is no freak-out about how a main character needs to make herself over for a guy, or anger that a friend dated a guy someone likes, or anything like that.

2167,mrlorenzosnow,Shouldve never been made,1,30 July 2016,"Messed up a great film series. Shouldve just did it right with the remaining alive members of the film. Not funny. Corny. A waste of time. Bad acting Not enough details This can not be a reboot This is not the film the Ghostbuster loyal fans wanted I wish Hollywood would freaking listen to the fans. we Make Hollywood sell. Not them I will definitely boycott this films series until they get it right. Mad at Dan Akroyd. He co created the Ghostbuster series and he let this mess hit the theaters.I was,like many, against this film being made from the get go.One of these days they will learn you cant reboot and flop movie roles and types.the original way always work.Not this new age give women the same role stuff.Please do not waste your time on this horrible movie.",Ghostbusters
2168,edwardthomassutton,Extremely good movie,10,30 July 2016,"I never watched Ghostbusters (1984) as a child, and so I went into Ghostbusters (2016) having never seen the original. However, the day after I saw the new one, I watched the original; the day after that, I went and re-watched the new one. Even on the first viewing, this was a very good movie, which is why I went and saw it a second time, and am planning on going again. Now, I will admit, I don't particularly like Kristen Wiig and Melissa McCarthy -- I've seen them in other things, and simply not found them funny. However, in Ghostbusters, they really changed my opinion of them. The chemistry between them, and with Leslie Jones and Kate McKinnon, is sharp, witty, and had me laughing out loud many times. Jillian Holtzmann and Patty Tolan (portrayed by Kate McKinnon and Leslie Jones respectively, two actresses I had not heard of until this film) were, in my opinion, the best characters in this film, offering the most laugh-out-loud lines and, frankly, being the most interesting. Everyone's acting was superb, including Chris Hemsworth, whose character was ridiculous and cartoonish without ever overstepping the line into annoyance. The only character who I would say was lacking was the villain -- he was intimidating, and offered some extremely good content, but he felt a bit empty. Audience were never really given a backstory, and his motives were very vague. Other than that, he was very well executed. SPOILERS AHEAD.There was even more for me to notice on my second viewing, after I had watched the original 1984 movie, crucially all of the callbacks to the original. The firehouse, for example, or Ecto-1, or the subtle nod to Aykroyd's ""Listen, can you smell that?"" line in the original. And, of course, Slimer. These things are all included without ever feeling shoehorned or forced, and offer a nice bit of homage to the source material. The fact that almost every original character makes a cameo in the new movie was also very refreshing. (Harold Ramis, of course, did not appear in the movie, although there was a reference to him in the form of a statue, something audiences can only appreciate having seen the original. Rick Moranis, too, makes no appearance.) Rather than reprising their 1980s roles, they took on new characters, and despite having very little screen time, delivered their lines with the same top notch acting quality as in the original. It also never once felt like the movie was simply using the original's popularity to make people like the new one more -- it simply felt like they were acknowledging the source material in an interactive and fun way. This also adds a level of enjoyment to the movie which cannot be appreciated by people who have not seen the original -- it's fun to look out for easter eggs, references, and cameos, and can be turned into a game of sorts. Then we come to the plot. The origin story of the Ghostbusters, and how they come together, is very much similar to the original. Additionally, the way they defeat the enemy at the end of the movie is practically the same. However, despite those things, the rest of the plot is very different and very original, very differently paced, and overall its own entity. The idea that this movie is somehow a remake of the original has some grounding, but is ultimately wrong; it is simply a reboot which takes a lot of inspiration from the original, but adds a new and interesting spin to it.This movie will not appeal to everyone, as is noticeable simply by scrolling through the reviews section. The target audience of this movie is very different to that of the 1984 version. However, those who like it are likely to love it, and the scathing critical response it has been met with is largely unfair. I was very happy to pay full price to see it twice, and will be very happy to pay full price to see it at least twice more.",Ghostbusters
2169,amandaraeosborn-17705,Loved This! I'm not understanding the bad reviews on here!,10,31 July 2016,"I just saw this movie tonight. I am a child of the 80's and enjoyed the original movies. This movie was every bit as good as the original. In fact, I liked it more. I loved Chris Hemsworth's character and was surprised at his comedic skills. The ladies were wonderful together and possess undeniable chemistry. Kate McKinnon, Leslie Jones, and Melissa McCarthy were a dream team of Ghostbusters! I loved the all female vibe and thought they were even better together than the all male cast of the original. You really should watch for yourself and form your own opinion. It had very good reviews on Rotten Tomatoes, so I decided to give it a try. I'm glad I did. In fact, my whole family enjoyed it!",Ghostbusters
2170,biancafransen,Four women respond tot sightings of ghosts all over the city.,8,31 July 2016,"What I love about this movie is that it does not take itself too seriously. It takes the concept of battling ghosts and has fun with it. It is seriously well- made though. From the jokes, to the plot and including the cool music - everything is there for an entertaining couple of hours. And I love the fact that 4 female geeks and nerds in this movie never look out of place. They rock the look :-). I think they did a good job balancing nostalgia and modern progress. For instance: they use 3D as it is supposed to. I am not entirely sure, but if memory serves me right the plot is more fleshed out in terms of the potential threat than the original. And the gadgets are cool :-).",Ghostbusters
2171,hermionejeangrangerda,"Beautiful, hilarious, excellently done.",10,31 July 2016,"I very rarely rate something 10/10 but this movie was not only thrilling and hilarious, it was visually stunning. The 3D effects used to bring the spirits to life have beautiful vivid colours and particle effects that give them a distinctly 90s stylization, but a haunting and beautiful presence on screen. The sound is pretty awesome, and the new Fall Out Boy Ghostbusters song effectively brings this classic tune into the new Ghostbusters look and feel. The cast is hilarious and their dynamic is beautiful, honestly. A diverse cast of women scientists, both professional and whimsical. This movie is 100% better than the original ghostbusters, I recommend that absolutely everyone and their grandmothers go see it. Love, Love, LOVE",Ghostbusters
2172,xerokane,"trailer sucked yes, but....",8,31 July 2016,"The trailer sucked, and in truth made me not want to watch the movie. Then I heard the original cast was involved. Thought if they were giving it a chance so could I. The film had a few minor issues but overall provided an entertaining night.Please ignore the Xbox youth that are hating on the film. They are really showing their childish behavior with what's been written so far. It actually astounds me with how vile some of the reviews have been.If you liked the old films you should like this one and love seeing the old cast show up.

2173,chryssa-91886,"Excellent, funny and well paced",10,6 August 2016,"Great fun, silly and funny in the spirit of the original, but with funnier, more engaging lead characters. Well paced and very watchable. Thoroughly enjoyed it. The film received a lot of negative comments, because it featured women as ghostbusters. It is OK to do this, this is not the 80s any more. The actors are very funny, the script well written and the appearances of the original actors in the remake are a nice touch. Overall it was an excellent remake; sufficiently different to make it fresh and new. I re-watched the original two ghostbusters for good measure. They were great fun and a bit of a blast from the past, but the new film is much funnier. Go see it!",Ghostbusters
2174,retreatpk,Perfect summer popcorn movie!,8,1 August 2016,"I generally hate remakes and thought using an all female cast was a gimmick. The trailer was terrible and doesn't work, maybe because some of the funniest moments are clearly improvised. But I thought I should at least see the movie before judging (unlike many ""reviewers"" on here). I was sooooo pleasantly surprised!!! This movie is FUN and laugh out loud funny, my main criticism is it tried too hard to service fans of the older movie, but really it's full of quotable lines and improv. It will undoubtedly become a classic and is the first movie this year I want to go see again!!! I would consider this as good but quite different from the original.",Ghostbusters
2175,schnano,Definitely see this Movie!,10,1 August 2016,"I don't really understand why this film has so few stars. The plot was pretty solid, with one or two small holes that can really be overlooked. The effects were great. The humor was on point-the jokes were witty plays on words and situations. The cinematography was brilliant. Taking socio-political aspects out of the equation, this Ghostbusters is a well-crafted addition to/reboot of the 1984 film.The only issue some might have is the receptionist, Kevin (Chris Hemsworth). He is stupid, going beyond even the normal 'hot dumb blonde' trope. He regularly messes up the most menial tasks, and the women only keep him around for his looks. This role reversal (that's what it is, mind you) is complete satire of Hollywood's representation of women. Kevin is a lovable dope and even his over-the-top stupidity adds witty humor akin to that of the late Gracie Allen.As for the Ghostbusters, they are represented as human beings, rather than objects for male affection-they're scientists (except for Patty) doing their jobs, like in the first two movies. Unlike the first two, there isn't any sex implied at all.Maybe there are those who can't handle witnessing these kinds of things in film. Maybe that's why it only has 5.4/10 stars. Because overall Ghostbusters is a great movie. 10/10 will see again.",Ghostbusters
2176,kiorck,Seen it 4 times so far!!,9,1 August 2016,"Excluding the racial stereotyping which, in fairness, is unnecessary and doesn't add to Leslie Jones' otherwise really funny and lovable character, this movie was excellent. The Ghostbusters themselves were awesome, from Kate McKinnon's off-the-wall wackiness to Kristen Wig's awkward but endearing nerdy-ness, each of them had something awesome to bring to the casting, and it made the movie fun. I was worried due to Melissa McCarthy's past comedies that there would be rampant fat jokes, but there weren't! It was a wholesome, fun time, with good jokes, a great atmosphere, and a positive attitude. I also love the role-reversal of the secretary (played by Chris Hemsworth) being a ditsy, stunningly handsome man, who is only good for his looks. Too often in movies are women put into roles where their most important feature is their attractiveness, and how attractive the men around them find them. But in this movie it was the man who did nothing but be attractive, and I found that very refreshing and funny! He was an over-the-top commentary on the sexism in film, and I thought it was well done and hilarious. Mostly, though, I love the new Ghostbusters team, and I think this made for an awesome remake with plenty of Easter-eggs and cameos for fans to enjoy.",Ghostbusters
2177,fauxjuggernaut,Keep crying man babies,10,2 August 2016,"I'm going to see this movie nine more times to spite all of the men on this site who are heralding it as an awful film. This movie was anything but terrible. It is now officially one of my favorite movies and I'm recommending it to every single person I meet. People are so upset about the ""reverse sexism"", newsflash, ""reverse sexism"" does not exist. You cannot oppress a group (men) that historically and societally has been seen as inferior. Stop trying so hard to feel oppressed. It's not going to work. You sound like idiots. The characterization of Kevin served to highlight the way women have been treated in cinema from day one. He serves as ""the lamplight character"", the character who is solely present because of their good looks. He was unintelligent and did not help in any conceivable way but he was attractive. This has always been the case with women in film, they exist to adhere to the male gaze. It was refreshing to see a man play this part. Obviously, your sense of humor sucks if you think this film isn't funny. I laughed throughout this entire movie. I laughed so hard I almost peed myself. I saw it with my uncle and after we exited the theater, he said, ""That was absolutely hysterical."" I have so many good things to say about this movie. There was no fat shaming whatsoever. This movie, for the first time, showed women sitting around, eating pizza and just talking. We never see that. This movie showed heavier women running. There were no comments made about them ""being out of breath"" or needing to stop running. This movie showed women moving in slow mo action shots. It did so many things right. I'm sorry that all of the crying man babies hated it so much. Masculinity is fragile. I'm sorry that you're suffering because for once you're not in the spotlight. Go watch the thousands of other movies made to inflate your manhood. Let women enjoy something for once, Jesus Christ. You have countless movies that you can watch.

We don't see much of this anymore, and although I didn't enjoy the first one that much (I saw it only a couple of years ago, out of a sense of duty because it is a classic), this one made me laugh. I'm not so much of a first degree humour usually, and this is mostly what Ghostbusters is about - although there are second degree jokes thrown in - but I genuinely liked this.honestly people come here claiming they kept ""an open mind"" but really, it's amazing how many of them critique things that were actually the SAME as in the original.I'm talking to you girls now: don't let the haters discourage you: the feeling I got walking out of the cinema was really cool.

But it wasn't. it was a terrible, unfunny waste of my time and every other poor soul who had the painful misfortune of having to sit and bear witness to this god awful, inane, inept and pathetic excuse for entertainment. Not a single moment did this wretched movie give me the tiniest iota of anything that would resemble pleasure. Not a single joke made me laugh, not for any second could this film make me muster up a single emotion other than pure anger and disgust, I didn't care about any of the main characters and was so detached from them that if all 4 characters died horribly in the film I would have less of an emotion than I do when I flush my excrement down the toilet. Further-more just to give you an idea of how comprehensively bored i was, I found myself looking at my watch at a point in the film hoping it would be nearing it's end only to find that the film was only 30 minutes into it's running time. I abhor, despise, loathe and resent this movie and plea to anyone reading this to avoid this movie like the plague that it is. In fact I retract that statement as frankly comparing this film to the plague would be an insult to the plague as it has far more reason to exist than this film does.",Ghostbusters

""A"" because the original Ghostbusters is a classic in my family, but I never really cared for it or found it funny, and ""B"" because I don't think Kristen Wiig is particularly funny either. I'm glad my sister talked me into it though because this might be favorite movie of the summer! It's absolutely hysterical and Chris Hemsworth is a total babe in glasses. The four main characters were all love-able, and each had their own distinct personality. The plot was intelligent and able to stand apart from the original two, even though being a remake there were a lot of similarities. I also thought that the throwbacks to the originals were creative and well-placed throughout the movie. I would recommend this movie to everyone, whether they've seen the original or not, or they're like me and think the original is stupid.

Those who watch this movie with negativity from the start and try to compare it with the first Ghostbusters, will truly miss out on a great movie and the fun to be had from it! BTW,this is a positive review that is REAL from a not so young person. I definitely recommend watching this movie! The people in the theater both times we went seemed to laugh a lot and really enjoyed this movie too. Therefore,those of you negative-type people, please just don't go to the theater at all!

The beloved franchise from our childhood was completely gutted by the feminist, social justice warriors, PC Crowd.The big problem with 2016 Ghostbusters is the uninspired, boring script. The script lacks intelligence compared to the the original movie. The original movie focused on the bumbling government bureaucrats not the ghosts.The new version paints men as the enemy and is pro big brother. The movie makes all men seem useless and stupid.The plot is incoherent. The movie completely is incapable of laughing at itself. The special effects are horrifically lazy and ugly.",Ghostbusters
2185,bbfigueras,Great Watch,10,3 August 2016,"This movie was actually really good. It was filled with nostalgia but also with a fresh twist. The cast was amazing (also, queer representation from Holtzmann). It doesn't carry the exact same feel as the old one mind you but, I don't think that's what this movie was meant to do. Yes the original was great, but this one holds its own as well. There wasn't a boring second in this movie. The cast is strong and humorous, and I love the overall portrayal of women. These women were portrayed as intelligent, yet not stuck up, and their costumes were practically made (aka not for eye candy). This movie is great, especially for the new generation. My nieces are all looking up to their new heroes, the Ghostbusters. I 10 out of 10 recommend it",Ghostbusters

If women are in a movie does that justify calling it a 'man-hating mess?'. This movie was funny, witty, had a great cast, high-tech special effects that the original was missing and never a dull moment. I am a man and I would definitely go to see this movie again, it wasn't targeted primarily at women it was targeted at people that simply want a good movie to watch. When Itunes releases this for Pre-Order i will be sure to purchase it, please if anything don't believe in the stigma associated with this gem of a film. Just go and see it :)",Ghostbusters
2187,emileigh-32049,Out with old and in with the new,10,4 August 2016,"Listen, I get that people feel the need to be protective of a beloved movie and defend it with their life. Heres the thing, the old Ghostbusters movie still exists. Its still just as good. You're defending something that has no reason to be defended. Both movies stand on their own and are meant for different generations. I, having grown up with a father who found it necessary for me to experience classic movies, honestly love this Ghostbusters more enjoyable than the original. I wish I had this movie as a kid. This movie is so important to have for the current generation. For those who have a proton pack shoved up their butt, back off a movie you don't need to defend and movie you don't need to ruin. Reasons why this movie is important to this generation is women in science! The science field is lacking in women who are interested in it. Most girls at a young age like science and math class, but once they get to that age where they realize that society wants to see them a certain way their interests shift. This movie will help in showing young girls its cool and awesome to love science. Also over throwing the stereotype that men are the main heroes. Though their are movies where women are heroes, most are sexualized. Ghostbusters breaks how we should see women heroes in movies. Strong a determined on the goal at hand, not always following what people want them to be or do. And they address that many times in the movie. Overall I can easily say this is now one of my favorite movies and I plan on seeing it many time as I can to help it be successful.",Ghostbusters
2188,whitedr-18025,The NIckelback of Movies,2,4 August 2016,"Before trashing this movie completely, I'd like to say I respect these actors and fault the era that this movie was made in. This movie flopped due to the predictability of its writing and over the top attempts to be politically correct. It felt like a social experiment disguised as a crappy remake of the great original ""ghostbusters"" (1984). It was cheesy, and there was not good chemistry between the cast. All in all it felt forced, and I believe this movie best serves to document the negative aspects of 2010's culture. There was no bad intentions making in this film and it is an interesting thought experiment by having an exclusively female led cast, plus the role reversal of a male secretary who is sexual harassed but it wasn't good at all.",Ghostbusters
2189,marie-88012,Theater rocking with laughter!,9,6 August 2016,Do not fall for the other reviews. The movie was great if you're looking for a good laugh. It brought back awesome memories from its predecessor with a new spin. The chemistry between Wiig and McCarthy and the other leads was excellent. The plot had some nice elements - including how the ghost hunting quest began - but do not expect the latest and greatest CGI. It really was a parody of the older version and the goofy ghosts were kid friendly while still being unpredictable. You will see some wonderful surprises as well. Kids were laughing out loud and adults enjoyed it too. Walk into the movie expecting a good time and entertaining comedy and you will not be disappointed. This was great family fun! Loved it.,Ghostbusters
2190,lfrancisjr,Worse that Master of Disguise (and that is saying a lot!),3,6 August 2016,"There's an old saying: If it's broken, don't fix it. This reboot of Ghostbusters, doesn't just break it, It smashes it with a hammer, pushes everything into the wrong pegs, and then shoves it into a garbage disposal. In my years as a movie-goer, I have never seen a worst attempt at a movie, and I have seen stinkers in my almost forty years. This ""reboot"" (And I use the term loosely) is Sony's attempt at Happy' Madison's ""Master Of Disguise"" as far as I'm concerned. It was little more than male bashing, failed attempts at comedy and the writing was...just horrendous. The special effects were something out of a damn Disney Movie, instead of the scares that the original had. Indeed, Harold Ramis must be gyro-spinning in his bleeding grave. To the actors and actress's credit, they are all very talented, but this, essentially took a rather large steaming crap on a great franchise while attempting, blatantly, to push a feminist agenda. If this is an attempt at being inclusive, It succeeded, in the form of this steaming turd of a movie. I want my near two hours back.",Ghostbusters
2191,xanimebabyx,You know you're going to watch it so be prepared...,5,6 August 2016,"I've been excitedly anticipating this movie and did not watch the previews or read any articles so no story lines would be spoiled so I had no idea of the controversy surrounding this when I finally saw it.If you are a fan of the original you know you're going to want to see this, my suggestion would be if you can wait try to hold off until you can rent it. Also you might want to invite some friends over when you do, watching it solo you might not find it funny but sometimes group mentality can change affect your movie enjoyment.The first 5 to 10 minutes the movie I was very excited, it started off with a little bit of a scary scene that had me excited for tone of the rest of the movie. I thought we might get some chills and some laughs, but regrettably the comedy fell flat. We have to face facts that the type of comedy that is popular now is a lot different (and maybe not the right kind of Comedy for Ghostbusters) than what it was before. There was a lot of stream of consciousness dialog where the actresses sort of ramble and mumble what's on their mind and we in the audience are supposed to find that funny. It almost felt like the actors had not rehearsed before they filmed because they seem to just be chatting with one another and there was no feel of camaraderie. To befair I did laugh maybe 3 to 4 times in the course of the whole movie, and I did think while I was watching it that at least it held my interest but I guess I was hoping for a movie that made me laugh all the way through. There are a lot of slime jokes and a couple crude jokes that fell flat. The one real chance for comedy with Chris Helmsworth as a dumb blonde bombed. He could have been hilarious but his terrible stupidity eclipsed any believability. There's a scene where he keeps trying to grab something through the glass of a fish tank as though he's never seen one before. I actually thought he was supposed to be crazy rather than then dumb during the first part of the movie until the other actors kept commenting on his stupidity.I really didn't know any of the characters except for a nodding acquaintance with Melissa McCarthy. After reading a lot of the trivia on IMDb it appears that there were a lot of nods to the Animal House movies and SNL characters more than the Ghostbusters movie which is a bit confusing but may explain some of the attempts at humor a little more. Not only were the actors unfamiliar but the characters didn't endear themselves to me with the exception of the black actress who at least had some heart. In reading some of the reviews though I can see some of the stereotypes others commented on. The villain was lackluster and it might have been nicer if we were able to sympathize with him a little as I felt the director was trying to do but we didn't get much exposure to the bad guy before he was off doing his villain thing. He wasn't even a terribly good bad guy, I got the impression he was more of a vessel for something else though I never clearly saw what. And I was disappointed with Chris Hemsworth not only for his lame comedy but his portrayal of a villain as well. His character shows no interest in Ghostbusters and is only mildly interested in his coworkers yet suddenly mid movie he appears wearing a jumpsuit and claiming he wants to be part of the gang and a Ghostbusters as well. Apparently that's how it's done because the fourth lady Ghostbuster simply inserted herself into the group by ""joining the club"" and then later it is revealed she quit her job to become a Ghostbuster which was a weird way to incorporate a member and rather unbelievable at that.There's a lot of techno-babble thrown around in this movie and I swear had I played a drinking game where every time they said ""let's go save our city"" I would have been drunk right there in the theater. There are one or two semi chiller moments that did add to the fun, the mannequin part had me ready to cover my eyes and peek through my fingers but the scene does pan out in a non scary way. Having said that you may want to be cautious allowing children under 13 to see the movie, it might be a little scary for them (not to mention there's a scene towards the beginning of the movie where a man gives the ladies the middle finger about seven or eight different ways, though some may find that funny I guess). Also, I did have fun looking for the cameos from the original and I thought I missed Sigourney Weaver's so be sure and stick it out to the credits because she is in there.Bottom line you know you are going to see this movie,try not to read any of the extreme high or extreme low reviews, this flick is probably somewhere in the middle and you shouldn't feel guilty if you do like it nor should you feel bad if you realize this did not live up to your expectations but I think for a lot of true fans it simply will not. Take it with a grain of salt and just enjoy it as a mild summer blockbuster, don't think about it too hard (don't expect to laugh though) and I think you might enjoy this one.",Ghostbusters
2192,samitoivonen,"Entertaining, not at all deserving all the hate it seems to be getting",8,9 August 2016,"The reboot of the Ghostbusters has generated a lot of resentment from the die-hard fans of the two original Ghostbusters films. I also loved the originals, but I also acknowledge that we are talking about two pretty juvenile films that depict the adventures of a group of ghost-hunters. With the reboot everybody's acting like the basis of their religion was offended. What's the big deal? The new ghostbusters is a decent piece of popular entertainment. Characters are likable and fun, jokes made me and the rest of the viewers laugh and the effects are as good as in any other modern piece of cinema. In the end the new film will most likely generate new audiences for the classic Ghostbusters -films, so lighten up and let all flowers grow!",Ghostbusters
2193,buehlererin,Everything It Should Be,10,11 August 2016,"This film has received an overwhelming amount of negative attention, but it's unjustified. I'm going to skip over the tirade on misogyny and just talk about the movie.It's amazing.I loved the original Ghostbusters film and mostly loved its sequel. Somewhere in my closet there's a photo album with a picture of me in the single digits wearing my proton pack, complete with the bright yellow foam noodle masquerading as a charged particle stream. But I'm going to ask you, for a moment, to really think about those original two films. They are not untouchable cinematic masterpieces beyond the grasp of our mortal minds. They are goofy, paranormal comedies with SNL veterans and some seriously bad claymation dog demons. Things you may have forgotten: there is a suggestive ghost blowjob scene, a reference to physical intimacy with ectoplasm, and a flying ghost nanny with Peter MacNicol's face. But you overlooked that because 1) you were probably a kid when you first saw them, and 2) Bill Murray can make almost anything funny (except Garfield). I strongly encourage you to re-watch the originals before seeing the reboot. It will give you the right mindset and frame of reference for evaluating and enjoying this 2016 romp.The new Ghostbusters is everything the originals were and more. The cast includes more SNL veterans, the script offers up the same style of questionable humor, and there are plenty of winks and nods for old fans. The special effects looks great, not because I genuinely think that's what paranormal activity looks like, but because they are well coordinated with their live-action shots and the ghosts are the perfect mix of ethereal and silly. The plot is the same as before: a group of rogue scientists and paranormal enthusiasts team up to save New York from a supernatural threat. Kate McKinnon shines as Hotlzmann, flamboyant (and literally flaming) engineer extraordinaire. As a kid, Bill Murray was my comedy hero and I looked up to him like a second dad. In the contemporary film, Kate's character represents someone I can identify with myself. She's hilarious, she's science, and she's perfect. McKinnon is definitely the break out star in this film.Something else you might recall from the original Ghostbusters movies is that they are, for lack of a better phrase, socially problematic. The depiction (and often times lack of depiction) of Winston and some of the portrayals of women are not awesome. They are actually pretty horrible. The new film is not perfect, but it comes a long way. Obviously, there is the contentious issue of gender swapping the team. Why this is so heartily upsetting for people, I can't really say. These women nail it. As a young researcher in STEM myself, I can say the humor and struggle of academia and research science in the movie is pitch perfect. Chris Hemsworth presenting as a dumb blonde trope is not exactly amazing social commentary, but his character is genuinely funny and a delight to watch. (Pro tip: Stay for the credits to see him dance like an unabashed fool for the music video scene.) Leslie Jones' character Patty has earned some ire in the media. After watching the trailer, I was worried about this, but upon seeing the film I feel slightly better. Jones, like the rest of the players, creates a larger than life character who is a blast to watch. She's accessible and hilarious. From the trailer, the audience gets the impression she's a stereotypical ""street smart"" POC, but Patty is not just a sad remix on the abuse of Winston. She's a municipal historian, self-selects to join the ghostbusting team based on her own experiences, has equal screen time with her peers, and is never characterized as unintelligent or useless. Representation for POC could and should be better, but Patty Tolan is not as much of a systematically racist nightmare as clickbait headlines would have you believe.If you're a fan of Feig, McCarthy, and/or Wiig, then this movie definitely satisfies. Fart jokes, projectile vomiting, uncomfortable dancing, and wild action sequences abound. It's beautiful. McCarthy plays it (mostly) cool for a change with her character Abby. Less screaming and fighting than usual (The Heat, Spy, etc.), Abby is a die-hard but unconventional scientist who just wants a reasonable ratio of wontons to broth and to prove the existence of ghosts to the world. Erin Gilbert, played by Wiig, is the awkward and adorkable feuding colleague. With her shoulder roll and tiny bow tie, Wiig makes an excellent, nervous complement to McCarthy's straight man.To sum up, Ghostbusters 2016 is a great movie, in the same way that its predecessors were. It's goofy fun, crude humor, physical comedy, and a touch (or perhaps a heaping slap) of nostalgia. Go watch this movie and relive your childhood. If you have kids—take your daughters, take your sons—let them experience that same spine tingling, infectious magic that we all felt when we first heard the phrase, ""Who you gonna call?""",Ghostbusters
2194,terriekostiw,Better than expected,7,11 August 2016,"First, I never write reviews. I am only doing this so people may actually give this poorly rated movie a chance. We decided to see this movie when nothing else in theater really peaked our interest (so many children's movies are out!). I went in without high hopes since I LOVED the O.G. movies. It started off slow, I couldn't stand Kate McKinnon's character and thought.. this will be a lonnnnggg 2 hours. Once things got heated up and they did their first trek the movie took off. I found it funny, entertaining and really not that bad. I found Kate McKinnon's character entertaining, Wiig and McCarthy OK, but Chris Hemsworth, absolutely sold the movie to me. Not only was he amazing eye candy but his character hilarious! Leslie Jones annoyed me a bit but it was her character that read ""token black person"". They could've done without her the same as Ernie Hudson, only difference is they really stereotyped her I thought. The cameos were also pretty amazing. In the end, wasn't worth my $16 3D experience, plus $20 in snacks but I would recommend someone to check it out when available on Netflix.",Ghostbusters
2195,alexvindason,Great with minor flaws,10,12 August 2016,"This was the best damn movie I've seen in a long while. I didn't watch the original Ghostbusters movies, mostly because I'm tired of seeing mostly white men blow up cool stuff, and I admit I just watched this one because I didn't have to pay for the ticket. So let's start with the things I didn't like: 1. The antagonist was so flat and boring. Sorry, not buying this. 2. You know, I appreciated Kevin and his endearingly dumb escapades. And the revengeful part of me enjoyed seeing the roles reversed. But for future notice, I want my eye candy to be three-dimensional, not a reversed sexist trope. 3. I loved Patty but she was a stereotype. Apart from that? It was absolute gold. Funny and entertaining and badass. There was no romantic subplot, which was a relief, no sexist jokes, and guessing from my partner's comments (who's seen the original movies) there were enough cameos and references to the first two movies to please the first generation fans.I'd definitely watch a sequel.",Ghostbusters
2196,aqballerina,HILARIOUS Movie. Worth the watch. (I'm tempted to go see it again.),10,12 August 2016,"After watching Ghostbusters when I was younger, I had high expectations. I watched this movie with some friends and we all loved it! After, I went to check out the reviews and was surprised to see how negatively it was received.A lot of the negativity is coming from there being an all-female leading cast, with the male receptionist being portrayed as stupid. I've read a lot of complaints about all the men being either evil or stupid. First let me tackle the dumb and vain receptionist, Kevin. I think Kevin's purpose was for satire. To turn around the role traditionally played by women and then put a man in it to make a statement. This is the first movie I've ever seen that uses a male as the stupid character. Usually its always a female who's stupid... Why are some men taking such offense? Why is it OK when it's a female occupying the stupid role and not a male? Now as to answer the question ""Why are all the men evil?"" The mayor in this movie is male, which is reasonable because most political positions are occupied by males. The other antagonist is the mayor's female accomplice. Him and his female accomplice publicly shame the Ghostbusters, even denying that ghosts exist after the huge outbreak in the movie. I do not think it is unreasonable to have a male/female evil duo here. (Why do people think that's unreasonable?) The main villain who causes the mass outbreak is also a male, but he could have easily been a female. I think one of the reasons they may have cast a male is to give some variety, since all the leads are female (which was done in order to give a little flip to the all-male Ghostbusters. Cause why not?).I also don't see the issue with the female leads. They were all hilarious. (And apparently the audience agreed with me cause all I heard PLENTY of laughter in the movie theater I was in.)The actor who REALLY made me laugh was Kate McKinnon as Holtzmann. She was just so funny...one of my favorite scenes is where she was dancing with a fire going off and then danced to extinguish it as Erin freaked out. I also loved her solo fight scene where she pulls out two mini guns. Her licking the gun, her reaction to Abby being weird when she leaves the restroom, her general disregard to dangers, her toast at the end...all great acting. She was just phenomenal in this movie. Kristen Wiig as Erwin was a gem, and I think it was a great choice to open up the movie with her. She gets fired from her job, but then doesn't let that get her down in the dumps. She is a strong, intelligent, determined character. The type that would jump in after her friend into a strange portal without a moment's hesitation. Definitely a character to look up to.Leslie Jones as Patty was on point. Patty is one of the bravest and most confident characters, quitting her job at the MTA because she was not gonna accept a no for joining the Ghostbusters team after the crazy ghost activity she witnessed. She puts herself at risk by allowing the team to use her Uncle's hearse, and she helps them out with her extensive knowledge on the history of the city, constantly coming up with ideas. Although her character is stereotypical in speech and attitude, it is not a full stereotype like many claim because we can clearly see how smart she is. She is obviously a valuable member of the team. Some of her funniest scenes were her reaction to the moving plastic dummy and her trying to get the ghost out of Abby.Finally there's Melissa McCarthy as Abby. She is the glue that holds the team together; and she remains confident even when everyone is talking on the news about how crazy the Ghostbusters are. She reminds the team not to take heart to what the media is saying and focus on what is important. I like to think of her as the ""mother"" of the team. So there you have it. I think the four leads were casted perfectly.Loved the appearances from the old cast and references to the old movies.There are some plot holes. Where does all the money for extra equipment come from? How so they fix their packs so quick after Abby destroys them when she's possessed? And some other details. However I can easily overlook these because of how damn funny the movie was.The credits were awesome too; my friends and I ended up staying until the end because of the never ending clips and scenes behind the credits. They were quite entertaining. I really hope there will be a sequel to this version of Ghostbusters.",Ghostbusters
2197,sixshotmark,Pointless Remake.,3,13 August 2016,"Today I finally went and watched Ghostbusters...Spoiler Alert!To be fair it is a lot better than the awful trailer made it out to be.It starts very good.The four characters are interesting and quite likable.Kevin is quite funny in the movie.The writers really, well and truly missed the perfect opportunity to introduce these characters better. Instead of having Holtzman's character have Weaver as her mentor and have it in the end credit scenes...why not have her as Egon, Ray or Peter's protegee. or relative Hudson is Patty's Uncle...fair enough...but why not have Hudson's Winston character be her Uncle?More to the point, when they did not want to be compared to the original or be a sequel why bother with the original cast cameos...just utterly pointless. I am not to sure what to make of this movie.The characters were likable and there was some really good parts in the movie but the humour and overall story line just wasn't that great. In some instances it did feel a bit like a parody movie.The villain was really boring and uninteresting. Is it great? No. Is it as bad as I thought it would be? No. Could it better? Yes.The concert scene is a really wasted opportunity. A cringe worthy scene of the band playing followed by a brief cameo appearance from Ozzy Osbourne saying he is having a flash back. Why not just have Ozzy and his band on stage? That would have been far better.Having every male character and even some other females be stupid really did the film no favors.After the final battle the ending really, really drags on.How could this movie have been better? Maybe not have an all female cast. Have a bit of diversity. Not rely so much on humour, such type as it is. Remember the original movies were sci-fi movies with comedy, not a comedy with sci-fi movie. Base it after the events in Ghostbusters 2 instead of wasting so much screen time with them investigating making the equipment etc. Consider how unrelated it is to the originals just don't waste time with original cast cameos.Believe it or not I will say I enjoyed this movie A LOT more than Batman v Superman!This movie had some good parts but quite a lot of silly faults that hold it back. I don't love it, I don't hate it, it's a fun enough okay movie. But it is frustrating at what a wasted opportunity this movie. Strange humour, to much reliance on jokes, a needlessly long introduction and boring villain really hold it back.The portrayal of every male and even some other females as being really stupid also does the film no favors.These faults are nothing to do with the cast or the female cast, just a problem of the writing and directing.3.5/10",Ghostbusters

A movie that can entertain audiences from different ages, for those who love comedy, action and ghosts! The cast is simply awesome!

Also he liked the cameos (who I didn't really understand because I haven't seen the original).I'm not a movie fan so I usually go to the movies once and that's it... so I think this is the first time I've seen the same movie in the theatre five times already. This may not be so special to movie fans... but it is for me!!I just loved this movie so much. I like animations and computer graphics, so I liked how the ghosts were made of that... sure, some people might think they look cheap, but hey, it's a comedy, not Paranormal Activity.Everyone in the theatre was laughing out loud, and I was glad I went to see it on the busy time of the day so I can enjoy laughing out loud with others.I try not to spoil so much... but I just want to say that the characters are awesome. Friendship is a big part of this film. Please, just give it a try once, and if you don't like it that's OK... but I just loved it, and if there's anyone who's planning not to watch it, PLEASE WATCH IT!!! It's a great film.",Ghostbusters

My motivation was, only and exclusively, all the men-hate towards this movie. Guys, I get you, I really do. You are not used to be represented by the stupid one, are you? You are used to be the hero. I bet that the sexist jokes made you really angry. But guess what? We, women, have been dealing with this jokes since the first movies of the history of cinema. ""The girl that needs a man"" or ""the hot girl that is almost too stupid to function"" (yeah, I kinda quoted Mean Girls there). This movie really turned the roles, right? And you did not like that. I think that this movie is funny for the genre. If you were waiting for an Oscar nomination... Well, you had extremely high hype. All the jokes were supposed to be stupid. Don't you get that? It's the type of movie that makes you facepalm a lot but be able to laugh. About the script: I saw a lot of comments saying that is basically the ""copy paste"" of the first film and other that say that it's the worst script they have ever read/listen to, so... Yeah, I wouldn't say that as the best script ever, be again, it's not an Oscar film. If you wanna read a nice review, read The New York Times.",Ghostbusters
2201,tidmanclassic,An all round awful film with no redeeming qualities,1,15 August 2016,"I didn't want to see this film with all the negative reviews about it firstly from Youtube as hearing the film would be a reboot my expectations sank even further and further as I watched the film unfold in my eyes, the film in itself has no redeeming qualities in the terms of good acting with a decent script the film falls right flat right away as with a lot of boring pointless unfunny dialogue which the original film hooked you right from the start. this film just failed without having anything interesting in it was just based on recycled ideas from other film not just from the original classic but it felt like to be honest a Scooby Doo film with all the daftness and poor special effects.What was really awful was the incoherent plot lines if it had a plot that I could follow without feeling the needs to turn my head away in a lot of scenes it was bad to watch to say it the most cringiest about it was the fact that every male in the film was an idiot the manager at the concert screamed like a girl!!, everything in the film is a mess it's just a train wreck with everything that was in the original just trashed upon everything that fans loved about the original is mocked in this parody.I don't like the film but it could have been so much better if it was not a ripoff of the original the actresses were fine but I think badly miss cast with poorly thought out ideas, the new car Ecto 1 was a joke also the costumes it looked like a cosplay on Ghostbusters rather than a film you could take seriously.1/10",Ghostbusters

It was perfectly cheesy and funny, and it kept my attention the entire time which is rare for me. Every character reminded me of people in my life, especially Holtzman who reminded me of one of my best friends. As a fan of the original Ghostbusters, I have to say that this movie surpassed my expectations while keeping with the heart of the original.

I've seen the reboot in theatres twice now (once in 3D and once not), and I can honestly say that it's an amazing film, and an important one - not just for kids (both boys and girls) but for women like me who grew up just wishing she could create amazing toys and tools to hunt ghosts with like Ray and Egon (I had the biggest crush on him) in a wicked (and functional) jumpsuit (distinctly different from the usual catsuit female heroines get stuck wearing). Middle-aged guys who watched the original as children and adolescents - you already got your film - don't begrudge us ours.

2204,robertcassidy,Not The Movie for Women Empowerment,1,16 October 2016,"Remaking movies is risky, but remaking a classic like Ghostbusters with horrible acting, horrible story line, horrible attempts at humor, horrible special affects and horrible uniforms is an insult to the Real Ghostbusters of 1984. This movie was about women empowerment, plain and simple. It was designed to lure the feminists in to the theater and give the movie ten stars, like most of the feminists on this site have done. Lets face it, most women don't appreciate good movies. Most American women especially, don't care about movies like this but as soon as they advertised a Ghostbusters version with 4 women, feminists all across America got excited. The men bashing in this movie probably sent them over the edge. I'm not against female empowerment movies. There are tons of movies out nowadays that are designed to use and get the feminists dollars. If it's a new movie and I'll enjoy it as much as the next person but when you use a classic like the Ghostbusters to do it I draw the line. Ghostbusters 1984 was an awesome movie, 4 great actors put together, the uniforms looked better, the acting was WAY better, the story line was good and the movie was enjoyable. This movie had no story line and it's only purpose was to bash men. If we made a prisoner in Guantanamo watch it the Red Cross would cry a humanity foul and get the prisoner begging to be water boarded instead. I highly encourage everyone to skip this movie. You'd be better off going the rest of your life without watching and be perfectly happy. You wouldn't miss a thing. If you're an insecure woman looking for some sort of empowerment this is probably a good movie for you. I'm not against woman empowerment, I'm against using a classic like the Ghostbusters to do it. Absolutely terrible movie. Skip it.",Ghostbusters
2205,florianposch,"Don't believe the buzz... just turn your brains off and relax,",7,22 August 2016,"Admittedly, as 80's or 90's child, after watching the trailer and following the social buzz around it, you could instantly hate this as another franchise which was sacrificed for creating a modern rip-off that even breaks with original (male) cast and characters.For some reason, I still gave it a chance, maybe because there's not too much must-see movies around in summer months and I thought it could be funny if I just see it as a standalone- movie not having to care with all that Ghostbusters legacy.And surprisingly, it did a pretty, pretty good job in entertaining me, nothing more, nothing less...The female cast in general did a pretty good job in playing their quite diverse characters, their performances ranging from okay-ish to insanely funny - I really fell with in love with Kate McKinnon and her playing the bats**t crazy Jillian Holtzmann.Despite of what you've heard or read before, its clearly not a feminist version of the original - way too many stereotype jokes pulled off, some even trying too hard (""That stuff went everywhere...""). In general, Ghostbusters goes for every potential joke, goof and stereotype, but most of the time, it just scores. Maybe too much, but not for me... sometime I appreciate a high pace of stupidity and can deal with a simple plot and several inconsistencies. I really had to laugh quite hard and absolutely think it was worth the money - I'd watch it anytime again, at least on Free-TV.Regardless of the character overhaul, it still picks up most of the traditional elements of the original movie in terms of equipment, locations and even ghost characters, maybe it even tries too hard with lots of references and many original cast appearances. Could be an excuse for the female cast thing, though....Some also complained about the cheap CGI but I think they were clearly above average, in ghost detail animations as well as on New York City total shots when hell finally breaks loose.To sum it up: Get rid of expectations, anger about the remake and any feminist prejudice and just enjoy a 'good clean fun' summer blockbuster - there's still more love and detail in it than in the new Die Hard movies.",Ghostbusters
2206,dragonforcegaming-65273,Overall a good movie.,8,24 August 2016,"I went to see this with my wife. I normally do not go to a lot of movies at the theater. However, growing up with GB and GB2, I really wanted to see this version of it.I thoroughly enjoyed the little Easter eggs throughout and the cameos from the original cast were a great addition. My favorite installment to this day is still GB but I will say, GB2016 rates on par with GB2 for me. I enjoyed the comedy, the action, and music.I will say, without getting too specific, that there were a few parts I did not enjoy. Some of the very cartoonish CGI for one(you know which part I am talking about), the incredibly ditsy (more so than Janine by far)Hemsworth and I truly did not enjoyed the design of slimmer or his ""girl ghost"". Slimette? ^.^ Both GB2 and GB2016 had their slow moments. For me, GB2 is very slow going up until the courtroom scene, then it really takes off and grabs attention. I always look forward to the Scoleri Brothers! GB2016's slow moments happen towards the middle but I think over all keeps a good pace. I am very glad the movie was kept under two hours and the pace of the movie, for the most part, made it feel less.Overall, my wife and I were satisfied with the movie, I had a good time with my wife and we both had some good honest laughs. I rate this movie an 8 out of 10 as I would do the same for GB2.As a side note: My review tries to come simply, from my straight forward and honest viewing of it, without a predetermined bias.Thanks for reading my first review!",Ghostbusters

It's awesome to see smart women who aren't the basic beautiful romantic love interest. Zach Woods and Chris Hemsworth were pretty good in their roles, even if they were briefly on screen. It had a great opening and an interesting plot, but did have a lull in the second half. There was a part of the movie that didn't make sense until I saw the end credits sequence, so editing did chop some detail. There was a lot of brightly colored CGI, but that is to be expected.

It's extremely funny and full of lots of different kinds of humour - sitting in the theatre hearing little kids and seniors and everyone in between laughing at the same jokes as well as different ones was really nice. I found the pacing really engaging, effectively getting the audience invested in the plot and the characters and making the build up irresistible. The special effects were really vivid and just right for the tone of the movie. The characters are amazing, multifaceted and compelling, and very relatable.

Normally, I'd say to each their own, but to each and all, I say avoid this film!I gave it a few years before watching it to let the hype and controversy calm down, so I could go in with an open and fresh mind, interested in seeing how this would play out.Unfortunately, this film was a waste of the nearly two hours of my life. Had this been more of a ""passing of the torch"" film, I'd have been happy, but this screams nothing but ""men are stupid evil pigs, and women are the superior gender!"". Characters and their chemistry are blasé if not utterly void of any camaraderie. Story: lacklustre. Special Effects: dismal and an eyesore. Harold Ramis would be spinning in his grave to see this pathetic excuse of a comedy-horror film.This movie has done nothing to change my opinion about reboots and remakes. All they seem to be is nothing more than a kick right in the childhood and extort your lunch money like the big blundering idiotic bullies of yesteryears.

I sometimes find it hard to enjoy some of the characters she plays when in SNL. However, I was pleasantly surprised! She's absolute GOLD and deserves a whole heap of praise! If you are intelligent with a sense of humor and like to get entertained by an awesome cast and cool special effects, well, go see this movie.It's a good one. Lots of humor, excitement and momentum! On several occasions the audience shouted straight out. You know what kind of scream I mean, the ""tickle in the stomach 'cause it's both scary and wonderful"" -scream.

The stupid receptionist in the new movie doesn't really contribute to much until the end of the film but I do understand why he is there. Anyway. I recommend seeing the film. In 3D. It is nicely made, has humor and warmth, and the story holds up all the way to the end. I laughed out loud, twisted in my chair when it got a little too exciting and well, I really enjoyed myself.Now I just keep my fingers crossed that there'll be a sequel to this movie.",Ghostbusters
2215,tylee-59654,worst movie of 2016,2,21 September 2016,it was good to see some of the original cast but I don't think they should have made the movie with these new characters. It totally wreck the movie and it seemed they just didn't fit the roles. I also think the roles should have been from the old cast coming back from retirement for one more show making ghost busters 3. I don't see any new ghost buster movies coming out with the low ratings the movie got so it was waste even bringing it back. I would also say there are some old movies out there that they have brought back but others they haven't and this is one that shouldn't have came back. one of the worst movies of 2016. long live the ghost busters 1&2 movie they were the best movies and I still watch them all the time same as everyone else.,Ghostbusters
2216,zelgadisfan,This movie was so cool,10,22 September 2016,"What's so great about this movie ? Women characters who are not sexualized and who get the right to be badass. Funny lines everywhere. Action packed movie. I went to see a movie to entertain me, not looking for something groundbreaking, and i got so MUCH MORE ! Don't trust the negative reviews. While not everyone might find it as good as i think it is, you still can have a good time while watching it. I'm giving it the highest note because i tend to think that this movie is panned by misogynistic and racist guys and it deserves so much more.See it ! You won't regret it ! (Bonus points for excellent cameo, really, it was awesome).",Ghostbusters
2217,vatiildal-31380,Ghostbust,1,22 September 2016,"To sum it up perfectly, if the professional reviews are great stay away. I read rave reviews for this and waited till the end of the credits for them to be right. Didn't happen. I will say I feel sorry for the actresses for getting drawn into such a horrible movie. I mean you can only do so much with a lousy script, but it is the stars who will be paying for this one with their careers. The studios that decided to go on rather than either getting the old crew back years ago, at least using Harold Ramis's script for ghostbusters three. At least it made such dismal money at the box office we won't be subjected to a second one unless it's a straight to DVD effort.",Ghostbusters
2218,pinkpostcard,I want to play a tiny little violin for all the whiners reviewing saying this movie 'ruins' the Ghostbusters franchise.,10,25 September 2016,"Did this movie re-invent the wheel? No. But neither are 90% of the other movies coming out this year.Ghostbusters managed to pay homage to the original movie while creating something fresh and exciting. Kristin Wiig, Leslie Jones, Kate McKinnon, and Melissa McCarthy do an absolutely fantastic job picking up the mantle of Ghostbusters. The entire cast of characters are well developed beings, and I mean, Zach Woods anyone? How can you rail against a movie with Zach Woods opening it like that?I'm thrilled that I was able to see this movie in theatres, and I'll be buying it when it comes out. At least give it the benefit of the doubt before outright dismissing it.",Ghostbusters

2220,roselutten,True to the originals! Loved it!!!,10,24 September 2016,"I loved the original movies. They were so funny and quirky! When I saw the cast for the new version of Ghostbusters I had BIG expectations, because these are some funny people, and I was not disappointed! The movie has the same feel as the original ones, but with an updated story and with lots of cameos! And it's so funny, I laughed out loud a lot! The characters are amazing, especially Holtzmann. Holtzmann is my new hero! And also, the secretary character brought some good comic relief. Not like the ""we need to have something funny here"" comic relief, but it really adds to the story and plot.The CGI is not what most people are used to now a days, but it's good. It has stayed true to the original visuals, which i love! It's so retro, just with much better CGI.To sum up: If you loved the original movies, you're going to love this one too! I really hope they make a sequel! And also, what's up with all these men crying wolf? And when I say wolf, I mean feminism. Don't like the way men are portrayed in this movie? Don't like an all female cast? Welcome to our world, and when I say our I mean the world of women. It's about time that girls get some awesome female characters to look up too! You know, the smart, strong, weird, nerdy, quirky, funny, fearless, kind, selfless type that we need more of! So don't say the movie was crap just because you can't handle all those awesome women, and men for that matter. The movie is just full of awesome characters regardless of gender.",Ghostbusters
2221,ellierivera,Seriously not that bad,6,28 September 2016,"One thing I will say is that a mass majority of the people complaining and reviewing the movie here are men. The tables were turned and now every guy is offended. The movie was not bad at all, truly, with all the negative things I was hearing before, I was expecting a disaster, however after watching it I realized that the movie was okay. It wasn't the best movie I've ever seen but it also didn't make me want to kill myself (I've seen worse movies) Everyone complaining about this and how the original is better, GOOD FOR YOU! You still payed your ticket to see and judge this movie and it still earned them all money. It's a freaking movie, the 80s Ghostbusters and 2016 one, it's just a movie. If an all female cast or a remake is affecting your life this much, you need to reevaluate yourself. Get over it and move on there are far more things to worry about in life than complaining and whining about a movie.",Ghostbusters
2222,TheFlameTV,"Stick to the original, avoid this garbage.",1,29 September 2016,"I ask - Is Hollywood trying to push an agenda in this film? This movie was awful from the very start. The humor was crass, the cast was lacking, and the execution terrible. Even if it was a parody, they failed.Make your own conclusions based on the casting, but avoiding casting any male figures in prominent roles is a bit transparent, Hollywood.Better to not subject children to this piece of trash. Stick to the original. Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramus have to be embarrassed to be associated with this re-make, even if they do not admit it publicly. Even Sigourney Weaver must be ashamed of this one.",Ghostbusters

I say 'borders' on offensive because I'm not particularly sensitive to feminist propaganda but I don't like double standards. You can be sure that if the genders were reversed, and woman were depicted like men were. Every single media outlet would be condemning the movie instead of championing it.All the sexism aside. The movie is crap. How on earth so many people gave it 10 stars is beyond my comprehension.

Despite all these negative reviews I watched this keeping my expectations to minimum. This so called Ghostbusters sequel (it's obviously not, just a no brain remake..) was purely aimed on promoting feminism. It's filled with pure stupid/ no brainier stuff with awkward jokes. I'm NOT going to refer this as a comedy even. It's an insult to all the real comedies out there.If you are a true fan of Ghostbusters avoid it at all cost. Otherwise, it'll give you nightmares.",Ghostbusters

The ""Comedians"" in this movie have no idea what funny is unless you are a developmentally challenged 8 year old. (Very funny... a fart from the front girls.. clever) The Feig guy who managed to ruin expectations that were already subterranean should never ever be allowed near a camera again. I don't know what else to say other than it was so incredibly bad. I made it through 15 minutes and I am so angry to have been cheated like that. I would rather watch midday commercials from a failing local TV station for 15 minutes than this.",Ghostbusters

If I worked for the marketing department at Clorox bleach, and I'd have to promote this terrible movie with free tickets for like every 3rd bottle you buy, I'd give you an extra gallon for free. YOU'RE GOING TO NEED IT! I downloaded this movie for free and I still want my money back. You have almost 5 times the budget as the original movie and you can't even double that number in earnings?

2227,kokoda-24015,Very bad movie. Big betrayal in the name of feminism,1,5 October 2016,"Honestly; this movie isn't even worth a minute of your time. the Blue-ray disc I got as a gift was never finished watching and went directly to the trash. A boring, impossible to relate to dialogues, story, actors and filming. And worse they made it a reboot -_- really! if it was a sequel that doesn't deny the originals I would have gave it two starts out of ten instead of the minimum one. To be honest I registered to IMDb to rate this movie because that's how bad it is. The movie have great and funny talents but not in this one. they are great when they have a movie made for them, but not when a feminist guerrilla fool tries to disregard everything that makes Ghostbusters and remove all colors that made the movie great to force his one color view to satisfy his flawed ego. well Id say thanks for investing money on him, money he burned, money he destroyed Ghostbusters legend with, money he made us fan dislike everyone in the decision process from the publisher to the movie director. shame, shame, shame on you for making this movie the mess it is. And I am sorry my friend spent money to offer it to me as a gift :-(",Ghostbusters
2228,bezzinatrevor,Tall Order as expected but did the girls pull it off ?,5,6 October 2016,"I think every Ghostbusters fan has long awaited for a reboot/continuation or anything which related to this epic franchise. This in itself created years of expectations which not even the original cast might have managed to pull off easily. I had to watch it. I think that deep down every avid fan will do eventually, but after watching the movie I can say that my decision was purely to tick the box and move on. Overall it wasn't bad, acting was good and some ideas where great, it's perhaps the overall amalgamation of things which lacked the kick. I would have preferred not to see too much of the original ideas. It was not a continuation, there was no link to the previous Ghostbusters legacy in the movie. So they should have gone with totally new ideas and avoid repeating similar scenarios or silly cameo appearances which by the end of it became a bit boring. The all female group might have worked better. Perhaps it was a gamble but I disliked Abbey's character as sometimes the comedy aspect was forced into the audience. An easier dose could have done it. The movie shows that there where a lot of ideas thrown around and the concept and story line wasn't bad. It really had potential but perhaps it is inevitable that we are all left unsatisfied with this movie. After all, masterpieces like the first 2 movies cannot be replicated or forged, they can simply be appreciated as copies. After this movie I am now more open to understand why great movies of the likes of back to the future etc should not be continued. We should be left with the excellent original experience as it should have been the case with Ghostbusters.",Ghostbusters
2229,egodwyll,A great funny movie. Just cant figure out what the criticism is about.,7,6 October 2016,"I enjoyed this movie for what it is, without any comparison to its predecessor. The ghosts looked great and each of the characters are funny in their own unique way. There was some great ghost-fighting tech too!!!. I think most people are comparing too much too the original. Hope there is a sequel. Liked the story of a scientist who used to believe in ghosts and is made to believe again. Great cameo appearances from the old cast. And Leslie Jones and Julia McKinnon are particularly funny. The character of the villain was also more straight-forward than the original. The movie as a whole had great funny moments and dialogue, even before the ghost problems set in and the movie is a great introduction to the franchise for anyone who has not seen the original.",Ghostbusters
2230,brianmayer-81958,"so stupid, it was great",8,9 October 2016,"The plot was thin, the characters were silly, but I loved it. You have to go into a movie like this with low expectations. If you're looking for something thought provoking and challenging, this isn't the movie for you. In my case, I just wanted a ""no-brainer"" movie to watch, and this was perfect. I was having the kind of day where I just needed to laugh and not think about the problems of the world, and this really hit the mark. I found the characters to be hilarious, and I wouldn't mind watching again in the future. There was a ""battle"" scene that ran a little long for my taste, but I think that 8 out of 10 stars is fair as long as your expectations are in alignment with reality.",Ghostbusters

What I wasn't prepared for was how brilliant and slick this version was! It was a wonderful tribute to the original, but so so so much better in terms of story, character building, special effects, jokes, music - everything. I had very good memories of the original but having watched them close together, it's impressive to see how far cinema has come in 30 years. And Boo-hoo to all the men out there who didn't like seeing women in the leading roles and to had to find out how it feels to be the butt of a joke for a change - turns out you also get dumb male secretaries and sleazy female bosses too!

The script was brilliant and creative. I never find myself thinking about what I would do when after the finish the movie. This movie always wanted me to keep watching 'til the credits were over, to see that rare clip at the end of some credits!People are hating on this movie for Feminism and that the movie is making it seem like women are better than men when the movie isn't trying to.

2235,jmcollins-32540,"Have to see what happens going forward, but solid reboot for GB fans.",7,15 October 2016,"So I am a huge fan of the original Ghostbusters movies. First off, to say I was disappointed when they announced that 1. This new movie wouldn't be a sequel and 2. It would have an all female cast, would be an absolute understatement. And no, I wasn't disappointed because I didn't think that women could be Ghostbusters, but because this franchise was way too big to screw with in order to attempt to prove some political/social point. But fortunately the four actresses they picked were great and funny choices judging by their previous work. I went into this movie with low expectations and I walked out a satisfied Ghostbusters fan. Plenty of nods to the original, superb performances by the female leads, action-packed, good story, and they throw in the biggest curveball of all with hilarious stupidly of Kevin (Chris Hemsworth). The entire movie felt like an original GB movie throughout and that alone was hard to accomplish. The entire production team should be commended for that.HOWEVER, here's where it gets complicated. The last scene after the credits ultimately sets up what will make or break this movie. The line ""What's Zuul"" gives Sony a tremendous opportunity going forward. I've read a great number of theories online that consist of a parallel universe which could connect the original to the new and Zuul could be the connecting factor. Obviously the cameos by the original cast kinda make this more difficult, but maybe they could explain it as a ""past-life"" kinda thing. How they do this I will leave up to the writers. But I believe they have to somehow connect the new to the original for this franchise to survive, that's what the fans want. So can everyone please accept the fact that the new GBs are women and be thankful that they had great performances. I mean regardless of this fact and no matter what they did, was this movie gonna be as good as the original? No. But it was solid and enjoyable. So we have to accept the path that Sony has taken and hope they continue this franchise with the right steps.SOLID MOVIE, BUT Sequel WILL ULTIMATELY DETERMINE HOW GOOD THIS MOVIE ACTUALLY IS.",Ghostbusters

However after 45 minutes of senseless farce and Melisa McCarthys' non stop talking I have to give this film one star. Crude humor was everywhere for no reason. I like Kristin Wiig but not in this movie. I mean, who wrote this script? McCarthys mother? McCarthy never shut up! I'm surprised Murray, Ackroyd, Weaver and others agreed to put in a few minutes. I think the story could have been good had Harold Ramis been around to direct it. God Rest his soul. The movie did not flow well and any child could tell it was cut apart to shorten it.

I'm still laughing. The movie had all the nostalgia of the original with some fresh gags, funny as hell slimming's, an interesting origins story, truly iconic characters (Holtzmann is a household name in many places, that's a damn fact) women in STEM, and a riot of a good time. It was hokey in the best ways, running with slapstick unique to the comedians playing the lead roles. Those who cried and kicked their feet don't have a leg to stand on in my book. True GhostHeads dig the material, and the nods made to the founding cast was equally delightful. Don't think of this as a rebirth or a reforging of the founding 1984 giant. This is a fresh universe with fresh faces that gives a lot of hope to girls and boys everywhere while being hysterical and more than a little crass when the mood hits. Definitely something I will watch many times to come",Ghostbusters

I love the song after the movie is over, love the jokes, the cameos, and the 4 main actresses. People act like this is that Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie, man that was terrible. Even the last James Bond film put me to sleep. This held my attention and I always love watching it.

The ""comedy"" in this flick is so bad that if I didn't know better I would have thought the Wayans brothers were behind it. It really feels more like a spoof at times. It was so bad that not even a cameo by the legendary Bill Murray helped. This is Santa with Muscles bad, in fact I would go as far as to say its the single worst movie (with a budget) that I have ever seen. The writers should be really ashamed of themselves for this one.

I was a little sad it was a remake in place of a continuation of the originals. Has some good laughs and mostly clean for younger kids. I like that the original cast took part in the movie. Slimer and his lady friend was well done. I think they picked a pretty good cast on this one it was cool to have a girl remake for my daughter who loved it. Kids will appreciate this movie probably not all adults. Special effects were pretty cool and my kids loved that they did the state puff man in this movie like in the originals.

This movie will seem best if you expect a terrible movie. Because the first time I saw this movie that's what I expected and I loved it. Expecting a masterpiece like the original Ghostbusters is not the way to go. Ghostbusters is my all time favorite film, and believe you me I watch a lot of movies. The second time I saw this movie I was expecting the high level joyride I got the first time. To me it seemed like a poo pile. If you want the most honest experience, you have to watch this movie when you just want background noise. The third time I saw this movie I had given up and figured I would just see A movie. That's what I got. Paul Fieg said that with the humor in this movie he didn't want comedy that offended people. And while that's commendable I don't think he knows how to do that. He could have gone with the body humor he's famous for in films like Bridesmaids but I don't think that's the best for a Ghostbusters caliber film. I absolutely love Paul Fieg but I think the job of this movie should have gone to someone who appreciated this series more. Also why wasn't it a sequel? All in all, I don't hate it.

It'd have been unjust of me to have set my expectations as high as Deadpool or some other slurry of that sort. This movie just blew my mind by hitting the newest lows. After having watched the trailer, I thought I should have listened to my gut feeling. CGI was the worst ever. Both the main leads have had made some great movies but this was like bitch slap on the face of the rapport they had of theirs. And the use of uncanny catchy phrases trying to make it look like something scientifically funny, I am surprised I did not vomit. This was rumored to make a feminist statement. If it was, it was a pathetic and a sorry attempt. All I can say about that was, This is what you have got in all.",Ghostbusters

The acting is pretty good, having said that, the writing never tested this theory. The over used special effects do look impressive. However, this doesn't excuse the lack of writing to make the viewer feel anything for the characters. In the original, we experience the love story between Peter and Dana, the battle to legitimise the research of the paranormal by Ray and the ongoing battle for Egon to understand normal life. This is all in the back drop of the increasing paranormal activity in New York. In this movie, three women decide to trap a ghost, another woman joins them in an obvious nod to Ernie Hudson's character and they get in a conflict with someone who wants to free the ghosts just because he was bullied at school?? There's just no effort in the character development at all. I would expect better from a film produced by Ivan Reitman. As for the cameos, Bill Murray's was good and Ernie Hudson's was weird but Dan Ackroyd?! Shameless!! Then the credits scene - obvious attempt to try and force a sequel.

I think a lot of the ratings on this movie have been unfair. It was entertaining, silly, and a fun film to watch with the family. There were some corny moments, but those are the ones that the kids in the room seemed to be most enjoying... But there was definitely some great adult-oriented joked layered in. If you go into the movie looking for a laugh and to be entertained, kid or adult, you won't be disappointed. If you're looking for something comparable to Shindler's List in its cinematic excellence, as many here seem to be, then you will be disappointed. It's definitely worth a watch, especially if you liked the original (which I watched again right after watching the remake); it's fun to see how they reinvented some of the tropes, jokes, and shots from its predecessor. 👍",Ghostbusters
2251,chrisjsweis,Worst film ever and painful acting that was forced comedy at best,1,26 August 2016,This remake was the worst forced cast of bad actors that had ZERO chemistry whatsoever together... Clearly going for some half arsed social statement that made people sick... Glad I did not have to pay for this movie and got my money back for this utter garbage... Never waste your money on this Do not watch it It was a waste of time you will never get back You will wish they burned this film and deleted every digital copy ever...It will be a modern miracle if any of these actors ever work together again or even on their own...Leslie Jones was horrible and painful trying to force her jokes at every stage...Bad acting and worse casting makes this a waste of money and time...,Ghostbusters
2252,jacycrowe,Glad I Didn't Spend Money On This,3,16 December 2016,"To start this off I will mention SPOILERS incoming. I repeat SPOILERS INCOMING.I shall treat this like a story I'm reviewing. Good stuff first.Personally I liked Patty best, and the gizmo-gadget lady second. Patty's about the only one who made me smile in this. I liked the opening scene, nice job there. Chris Hemsworth, good choice. I liked some of the special effects too, not all but some. Oh, and I like that the slime-dude went on a joy ride and found a slime-lady for himself. That made me laugh too. One last bit, I also liked Patty pimp- slapping that one woman. Now for what I did not like about this. I'm working from memory since I watched it a while ago and it's just not very memorable in my humble opinion.I found most of the acting to be boring and stiff. As for characters dang near all were quite blah. Didn't like that creepy lady creepin' on the secretary Kevin, and I didn't like the blond scientist lady for the longest time because I found her irritating. Over all I did not come to care for the characters - hell, if Patty or that blond woman had gotten killed I would have found it weird but I wouldn't have been bothered at all. Might have made the movie more interesting with a twist.That one scene where slightly funny squat woman is pulled into the vortex and where slender creeper lady dives in to save her?I felt nothing. Usually I LOVE moments like that because I'm a silly mushy goof at heart and I always tear up at scenes like this. Here I felt nothing but some relief that the movie was ending (note: I watched to the end so I could say I did).What else... ah, yes. Men. The males in this film, to my recollection were portrayed so... silly, useless, and A-hole-ish, it bothered me. It's the reason why I even watched it, to see if I saw what others did. Kevin bothered the crap out of me because his character was one more twig on top of the pile of reasons and irritations making this movie a fail on the amuse-me-i'm-easily- pleased scale bad end. I also did not derive any amusement from the bad guy getting shot in the crotch. Ain't funny, people. Well, not to me. Not after an entire movie where the men are all idiots to make the women look better.In short I don't feel as though I wasted too much of my time watching this precisely because I was also drawing something at the time.",Ghostbusters

2254,dockatecook,Absolutely superb fun.,10,27 December 2016,"There appear to be a lot of men on here moaning about this film. Do feel free to ignore them. It seems that some men simply cannot cope with any level of feminism. Clearly this film is simply fun, rather than polemic, but it does seem sad that it is attracting such poor reviews. In my view, the plot is great, the cast is excellent and, in all, it is just really good fun. There are still so very few films with women in heroic roles. Here they are stylish, witty and independent. They carry on the work of the original cart with gr at aplomb. The cameo appearances by the original stars, including the ghosts, are worth looking out for too. The effects are generally stunning, especially on the big screen.",Ghostbusters

Witty, funny, smart, well written, well acted and well directed. It seems as though most of the negative comments were made by people who had not taken the time to go see the movie. The best performance was Kate McKinnon who perfectly embodied a kind of punk Egon role and of course Chris Hemsworth who played the vacant beefcake with absolute glee. The whole movie was a fun ride, the 3D was worth the extra cost and you absolutely have to stay through the credits as there are just continuous Easter eggs until the very end of the credit roll. The amount of negativity is disproportionate to have very funny and well done this movie is. Would definitely recommend it!!!",Ghostbusters

If you are able to view this for the comedic performance in the goofy style of the cult classic then this reboot will crack you up. There are not funnier comedians out there that could embrace the goofiness of the original actors while managing ridiculous ghostly special effects. The bad guy could have been a bit weirder, but Zach (Veep) was the usual dude you love to hate. Could do without the super tacky ""flying"" hug toward the end. 7 thumbs up, laughed out loud several times as I do watching Kristen Wig, Leslie Jones and Kate Mckinnon on SNL. and McCarthy is just the best.",Ghostbusters

The whole movie has a made for TV vibe. Cameos were terrible.The villain was so bad with zero motivations.There is also zero character development in this. Writers should be fired. I can't find one positive thing to say, it's that bad.This isn't a sexist comment by the way, I watched this movie with the greatest mood and intentions and it just disappointed me and ruined my night.",Ghostbusters

I work for a telephone telecommunication company and I am hip to modern times and technology but don't tell me this is modernity.And the all new bad ghosts/same old bad ghosts wannabe whose name I don't even feel worthy of mentioning, is like a what? spoiled fat liberal who just smashes up everything around when he can't get what he wants... gosh... and this kind of character is a leader material? is a bad guy that people fear? *spit spit spit* Donald Trump save us from lamestream PC trash and the immigration that Hollywood want",Ghostbusters

There are so few ghosts in the whole film and we have a farting woman and unquestionable bad hygiene. The jokes are forced and the propaganda for dyke support is clear.Also the instruments were completely unimaginative. Could they not come up with some interesting instruments? If not why make this film since there are no interesting jokes or women or even ghosts?Yes we wasted time watching this but reading the reviews on this online websites tells me there won't be a sequel so at least they won't waste our time again but hey that was my Sunday I won't get back I am sure the feminists don't care right?,Ghostbusters
2264,neonate-47407,How does something like this get funded?,1,12 February 2017,"I've read conflicting reviews about this film and decided to watch it to gain my own perspective. I have no option but to say I'm disappointed to a furious degree. This could have been an amazing reboot, but is the antithesis thereof. The female cast was a great idea, but in the first movies the guys came across as comedic, goofy at most, yet mildly serious. I don't understand why the ladies were painted a shade away from moronic cartoon characters? Honestly, there are young writers and filmmakers out there with real talent and amazing stories to tell that are dying to get their work taken seriously and yet this kind of rubbish gets approved and funded? Nothing about the cast or visuals bother me, it could have all worked but the script and direction is loutish at best. I don't even understand what age group this was aimed at as I don't feel it works for any. Everything in this film could have been better with better writing and better direction, I feel it was robbed of both. The amount of time wasted on pointless dialogue and cheesy banter nearly made me stop the film and watch something else. I'm not being nasty or spiteful here, I unapologetically call this a waste of time and money for the people who made it, were a part of it or watched it. The only positive of this film for me and I mean this kindly, is that it offered employment to those involved. This is possibly the worst film I've watched 2016 to present.",Ghostbusters

Sure, it was juvenile and a lot like an SNL skit, but there are 1000s of movies with dumb blonde bimbos and equally sexist stereotypical characters that don't get this heat. Is it silly, sure. Did they rely on the original, sure. Will it end civilization as we know it? No. Was it a great movie, probably not.

It also had a stupid pretty boy played by Chris Hemsworth, but anyone in their right minds would not take a job with ghost-busters. It does have some adult raunchy jokes, but its a Melissa McCarthy and Kristen Wiig movie so you have to expect to see their humor. It is not as sexually orientated as the originals as it did not have a possessed Sigorney Weaver having a floating orgasm.

I had no issue with having a new female cast, but I didn't see why they couldn't have been the new generation of Ghostbusters instead of throwing out the previous two movies.I thought the actors did a great job with what they had, but it was a pretty so-so movie overall. I'm writing this review in 2021. All of the controversies are over. Who remembers this fondly? Who's streaming it? Who's getting together with friends to watch this? It just wasn't that good.

Its clean humour every scene is funny and unfortunately they put the best movie on blue ray.

The humour was constant and in the same vein as that of the original: witty, silly, irreverent, and light-hearted. I laughed throughout the movie and was smiling throughout! I love the new characters and the natural chemistry they share. The creators of this film also got the ambiance spot on! It really felt like the world of the original Ghostbusters, with a subtle twist, paying homage to the original, while expressing a fresh voice. In fact, I found this new Ghostbusters to be a good deal more entertaining than Ghostbusters 2. I get that people are getting sick of remakes; to be honest, so am I, and yes, there were moments my inner cynic groaned. Those moments were not, however, enough to ruin the entire film for me; there were 2 of them in the midst of a great many laughs. The negativity in many (most?) of the reviews of this film seems overly hostile and baseless, giving rise in me to suspicion that there is something more going on. If you do not like remakes, then why did you watch this, and why are you putting so much energy into denigrating it? If you did not watch it, then you have no right to be posting a review (and I question whether all these negative Nancies actually even watched the film). I understand writing a constructive, critical review, but most of what I have read have been thoughtless and unhelpful.",Ghostbusters

The opening works, but the second it jumps to the characters it begins to fall apart. Not quickly, Erin as a character works, but once they introduce Abby and Holtzman it slowly begins to unravel as there is no good chemistry. Compounding this, The biggest detriment to the movie is the need for constant dialog that simply doesn't work. This would have been better suited as an hour long straight to DVD movie. The biggest compliment I can pay this movie is that it is not outright atrocious, but it is the kind of movie I had to force myself to watch the entire way through.",Ghostbusters

Lots of action, a few scary moments, cool special effects. A LOT of thought and research was put into the scientific equipment and settings used in the movie ... this thing wasn't just thrown together. Of course it's got its lackluster moments ... some cheesy dialogue, a really corny action scene with Wiig and McCarthy near the end, jokes that fell flat, gags that weren't as funny because they'd already been released in the trailers. But overall it was incredibly entertaining. Also, it's *incredibly* refreshing to see a movie with four female leads where their main concern isn't to get a boyfriend.

Younger kids will really enjoy it. Sure the plot is silly, and the humour is a bit mundane and forced at times, but despite all of this I enjoyed the movie and it was just a good bit of fun to watch, original movie sentiments aside.It was a big flop at the box office so only time will tell if any planned sequels come to light.

I mean, how come more Ghostbuster be something bad? And it was AWESOME! I laughed so hard all through the film. I watched it many times after that. The jokes are on point and the scares are there too. I loved the characters and I related to them even more than my beloved original ones. I loved Melissa McCarthy as the leader of the gang, she had hilarious one liners. Leslie Jones is a personal favorite. I relate to her character the most, because I'm not much into science, and I do study history a lot as a hobby. And she is so funny (the moment she enters the Mannequin room cracks me up EVERY TIME). Of course, Kate McKinnon steals the show. Her character is so kooky, it's impossible not to fall in love. I totally recommend watching this film if you like fun and laughing. I don't see how so many people are upset about such an entertaining and pleasant film. Please, don't be led by misconceptions and watch this film with an open mind.

One of the biggest issues with this movie is it's over use of CGI. Almost everything that can't be used as a prop was made as CGI, with the exception of ""one"" ghost that used a drone. of course this is a trend in modern day earth, where CG is widely accepted as ""the future of digital entertainment"".

2295,aimeemurraymail,So much hate for such an adequate remake,8,7 August 2018,"I just took it for what it was, a Ghostbuster movie. It was a fun throwback, with some interesting characters and electric visuals. It's a pity it was overshadowed by feminist and anti-feminist propaganda. I loved GB as a kid, and got the same feels this time around. I hope kids watching it today can do so without any influential bias. There's more to it than that. Get nerdy, bust the ghosts, have fun, be heroes!",Ghostbusters
2296,brokachino,Give it another chance...,7,16 November 2017,"Wow, the reviews on here are harsh!! I saw this in the theater when it came out and I will admit that I wasn't too impressed, however I decided to get it for my 11 year old because we have and love the original films. I enjoy the movie more and more every time we watch it!First off, aren't most films a tad misogynistic in general?? I actually found it quite refreshing to see a ""male bimbo"" as opposed to a ""female bimbo"" for once. And for those that had a problem with the ladies hitting the bad guy in the crotch at the end of the film, I would absolutely do the same thing in a battle to the death with a male. I mean, come on now. Not to mention it was a ghost and not a real man, so....As for the cast, I really enjoyed their performances. Chris Hemsworth was ADORABLE, and has since been on my top 5. ;) I am a bit confused as to what exactly people were wanting Leslie Jones' Patty to behave like?? She is a black woman, and apparently the leads were improvising most of their lines, so I am assuming she herself made up quite a bit of her own characters dialogue and general personality. I thought she was HILARIOUS and no more stereotypical than Kate Mckinnon's ""quirky white nerd girl"". I think the best thing to do is to go into it with an open mind and don't expect Oscar worthy performances from a somewhat slapstick comedy. My family and I really love watching this movie together because it kind of works for adults as well as older children, and there aren't a ton of choices out there that I feel comfortable showing my preteen because of all the overt sexuality in pretty much everything. So I say give it another shot!:) Just watch for the subtle facial expressions, God I frickin love those women!!! :D",Ghostbusters

2298,spogeo,Don't Blame The Cast,3,23 July 2018,"When I heard that this movie was coming out, I was confused. Why remake a movie that was so beloved by so many. The movie has a strike against it before it was was released.When I finally sat down to watch the movie, it met my low expectations. Kate McKinnon could read pages out of a phone book and be funny. Melissa McCarthy is at her best when she plays a character that isn't over the top, same with Kristen Wiig. Leslie Jones has to be over the top, that's her style.I can't complain at the performances, they did the best with what they had. I thought the story was lacking although there was some good laughs.I'm hoping that a sequel is not in the works. Women with this much talent can find something much more befitting to them. If it happens to be on a movie channel, go check it out, lots of cameos.",Ghostbusters
2299,margaretbetker,Loved it,10,27 November 2019,"Funny, light, great comedians. Kate McKinnon is freaking hilarious. It's not a remake of the original so don't expect the same. Just enjoy it for the silliness and lighthearted fun.",Ghostbusters
2300,dereklesterzeigfield,Solid movie,8,18 July 2016,"Spoilers ahead:I liked Ghostbusters a lot. There's an infectious silliness that is definitely of a different tone from the snarkiness filling in the lines of an action horror movie played straight of the first two films, Hemsworth even riffed on a classic Buster Keaton gag. As everyone else says, Kate McKinnon is hilarious in her gutsy and defiant nuttiness. Hers is a character that doesn't care what anyone thinks, yet is passionate about her work.A major difference between this one and the original is that the Ghostbusters have their name thrust upon them. They're not a commercial enterprise that flaunts EPA regulations as in the original, rather an independent team that skews closer to actual scientific methodology (within the rules of this world everything makes much more logical sense than even Ray's explanations in the previous films). When they stumble upon their terrifying discoveries, they're quickly contacted by the Department of Homeland Security and forced to conduct their activities covertly, at least officially. While the government condemns them publicly, they thank them privately. It's a more nuanced premise than the EPA being relentlessly reckless and for City Hall to be relentlessly cynical.The villain is played by Neil Casey, formerly a similarly creepy character Kent Woolworth in Feig's previous sci-fi comedy venture ""Other Space."" SPOILERS for Other Space: But where Woolworth was part of the most endearing couple on that show, here Rowan is a sociopath bent on reforming the world in his twisted image of a utopia. Where previous Ghostbusters films would use ancient gods and dictators as villains, this film uses a seemingly ordinary guy, but with similar pretensions.While I loved the movie, a couple of things slightly bothered me:But when the HQ is above a Chinese restaurant, it would have been nice to see one Chinese person. As is, Karan Soni is the only person from the restaurant, and like Leslie Jones, the two major POC from the film kind of get piled on more than others.Also, if Leslie Jones was supposed to be the historian, I figured she'd be a bit more the Ray type, being well-versed in Tobin's Spirit Guide or something. Maybe instead of the MTA, she should have been the tour guide from the beginning. The closing credits have her ask who Zuul is, but I feel like she should be the expert on that. Or she should at least be the person the others ask about it.But overall, I'm excited to see if they make more of these movies.",Ghostbusters
2301,thepiratef,this movie was freakin awesome!,10,20 December 2017,Ok for the people who hate this movie is either retarded or just ur average troll first of this movie did kick major ghost ass and is what iv always imagined the ghostbusters to be like this! when the movie was over I was in tears of joy because I felt like a kid again! but with all there weapons in this movie was spectacular it just made more sense to me in the movie because the ghostbusters were on a low budget money cost in the movie so they build most of there weapons or gadgets from scrap witch made this movie really interesting. plus with the fact they don't trap the ghosts they just zap them with the proton packs and they explode witch makes this movie all the more interesting. so if u hate this movie again u most be really high or not a true fan to ghostbusters. I truly recommend this movie to any true ghostbusters fan and not the so called ghostbusters fan trolls. all the movie reviews on this site is suspiciously wrong.,Ghostbusters

(And I'll admit, I went into it with high expectations.) Kate McKinnon did kinda steal the show, but no complaints.Most of the original cast (Harold Ramis and Rick Moranis excepted) make cameos, but I think it's engaging without trying to either overdo the campiness or the nostalgia factor. There's some delightfully well-timed action sequences where the Ghostbusters theme shows up, and the ""ghosts get loosed in New York"" theme gets used again, but it's still pretty fresh and new.This is up there in one of the best movies I've seen this year, and I think much of the vitriol being lobbed at the movie was saved up, sight unseen, without a lot of evidence. The movie is funny, well-produced, fast-paced and a great flick to see this summer.",Ghostbusters

How do I know this, my 6 year old absolutely loves this movie. Like always asks to watch it! He loves the song, knows all the words and can't wait to see the original. However I know he's not going to enjoy the original as much as they just don't have the cool effects like movies now. This folks is reality and that's the way it is.

This movie is fun, pure and simple.Ignore the tragic douchebros (advice for life, not just for IMDb!) who swarmed all over this with single star ratings and negative reviews before it even opened and make up your own mind.And as for all you douchebros, I have one word: really???",Ghostbusters

2320,VeroniqueCL,Lots of fun for families,8,2 June 2019,"I was amazed by the number of poor reviews that this movie received, it certainly doesn't deserve them, it's actually quite good.
We had a lot of fun watching this movie as a family but we did not approach it as a remake, nor a sequel, the original actors are well in their late 60s and would look a little out of place running in garbage suits. Of course, we laughed at the cameos and the references to the old movies. It's amusing to have ladies as the ghostbusters and it does give a different group dynamic, a little like the reverse image. OK, the baddy is a little bland, but the jokes are good, the machines are crazy and the actors are just right.
Cranky reviews are all referring to the fact that it's a remake, well that's nothing new to the creative industry. Hollywood has always made remakes think Dracula, Stepford wives, body snatchers, 3 godfathers and the list goes on.... and theatre has done the same too. Other reviews just talk about feminism, these are the nastiest and are plain scary as to how some men think.
So yes, if you have a daughter who aspires to something else than being a dumb pink sex object looking for a charming prince that will turn into a toad, this movie is perfect. As for my son and my hubby, they both know I wear high viz and steal cap boots.",Ghostbusters

The 13 year old appreciated it but he never asked to watch it again. This new film held my boys' attention, The characters were well-drawn and likable. The action was intense and at times unexpected. My youngest asked if we could go see it again this week. I think for their generation, the 1984 film will be a footnote.

The cameos were depressingly sad. The story was non-existent. The movie had some real good funny moments followed by a ton of ""meh"" in the middle. It was like a mediocre SNL skit. Mckinnon was good but by the middle she acts like something off of a 10 year old's Nickelodeon TV show and becomes annoying. Jones is good for a few lines at a time before you realize she can't act. Hemsworth is Hemsworth and his character is done so bad you can't figure out how he functions as a human being. This version is a very empty shell of the original. No depth in the story or characters and the talent is nothing compared to the original at all. And the movie is designed to set up this argument ""If you don't like this movie then you are a sexist"". Sorry it fails all on it's own without sexism.And it even fails on it's own not being compared to the original. Maybe they need to stop casting ""Buddies"" together and write better.

2330,waynepovey,Don't Believe The Haters!,10,13 July 2016,"Firstly let me preface this by saying I'm a massive Ghostbusters fan, I grew up watching the originals... Even the second one! I still watch them now, I went to see the original at the cinema a few years ago on its anniversary release. I have my own Proton Pack, I have my own Ghostbuster jumpsuit, and I've worn it in public! I'm a true, hardcore, die hard fan......Ever since it was announced a couple of years back this movie has faced so much negativity, been completely destroyed by people on the internet, the trailers have been slammed and I know that this movie will flop because of such negativity, it already has a score of 4/10 on IMDb and that is a massive shame because......... IT IS ACTUALLY GOOD!!!I had always said I would give it a chance, and I did and I'm not disappointed! Lets start with the story: It follows a similar path of the originals, scientists working on their theories about the paranormal come together and recruit a fourth member who is a bit more streetwise. They start doing their jobs as the Ghostbusters; honing their skills as they go and working on their tech, the mayor and his office get involved, bit of a smear campaign, but it all goes to hell in the end and they step up and earn their stripes.The new cast work well, they're all women who have proved themselves on the comedic stage in Hollywood and they gel really well together. Kirsten Wiig delivers her uncomfortable in her own skin act and I'm sure that's why she was cast, the real stand out is however is Kate McKinnon who I'm sure will come out as the fans favourite. Chris Hemsworth adds some silly humour but still has an important part to play in the story.Is the humour as sophisticated as the originals? Probably not being honest, but that's not to say it isn't funny, the humour is just different, drawn from modern pop culture and is slightly feminine in nature with a bit of the old ""kids will laugh but the adults will really get it"" thrown in. I'm not going to lie, there were a few moments where I kind of rolled my eyes and did a bit of a WTF, but so what!? The special effects are top notch, but haven't departed too far from the cartoonish feel of the originals anyone who says anything else is tripping!The movie kept me entertained for the full duration, there were even some moments that left me surprised by their brilliance and there is plenty of fan service to be enjoyed including some familiar faces thrown in to the mix as cameos, but enough said about that.I'm not going to go into things like cinematography or directorial stuff because I'm not going to be that guy who pretends to know what he's talking about, when actually I haven't got an effing clue.... we all know one. Suffice to say that the film looks amazing!I really enjoyed it, but I feel its such a shame for this movie as I think its destined to fail, its been a real victim of the internet and it shouldn't be. it may have been the film that no one wanted, it may have been the film we didn't need, but that's not to say it isn't a solid, enjoyable and entertaining piece of cinema. Haters are gonna hate! I urge people to see it, give it a chance, throw away your preconceived notions and hostility, and watch with an open mind, I don't think you'll be disappointed.... and stay after the credits!",Ghostbusters

2332,livingshadow,An actual review...,8,7 September 2016,"This is an actual, bona-fide review of the movie itself.The movie itself, as a stand-alone, was quite good. I found it to be humorous at times, the storyline was at least engaging and most of the music was great. The only reason it didn't receive 10 stars from me was because of the theme song remake. The biggest and most damaging error of the movie is that for reasons unknown, the producers of the movie decided to include both the original theme song and the remake in the same film.That said, this concludes the actual review of the movie itself. As a final note, I believe the biggest reason why this movie is getting low ratings is because people compare it to or expect it to connect in some way to the original movies and/or show, which it does not. I also think the hype against it is so much that people are allowing it to affect their own view on the movie.

2334,motherherb,Under Appreciated and fantastic effects,10,12 May 2019,"I went into this with an extra open mind because all the ""ruin my childhood already"" crap/hype really annoyed me, but the original was the very first movie I saw in a theater and is part of who I am as a person. Bill Murray is intimidating to follow let alone put on his shoes, but they did it wonderfully. It has a strong script with tons of room for the casts endless improv talents. I want to say that one stole the movie but everyone crushes their character, Thor comes close to stealing this film though. He was a HUGE surprise and enormous joy! Jones can be intense on SNL, which I appreciate and enjoy but isn't for everyone, she is terrific in this movie! Not not intense but unnoticeabley so, she's happy exuberant and I love her positive addition to the group and film. Everyone holds their own in this film and isn't afraid to break pace for a well timed joke, or a joke that breaks pace. I don't explain it well, but They can make fun of themselves, have an uncool moment, sacrifice no laughs. Also the effects are incredible! Really bright colors and plenty of spook! The toys are really fun and cleaver.
The ghosts are really scary, the balloon scene is extra spooky and realistic. The relationships are authentic and I'm going to be honest, the original movie didn't hit as many emotions as this movie does. When Wigg dives in to rescue her friend it is beautiful touching and oddly believable, in the way that you believe she'd really do that. The lack of music in this scene is extremely effective and made me cry a wee bit. I enjoyed this movie even more then I could hope, which I tried not to do but couldn't help it.",Ghostbusters
