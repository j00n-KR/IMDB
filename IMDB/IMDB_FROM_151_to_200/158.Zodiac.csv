0,MartinHafer,"Interesting and well made...but like the case, frustrating.",8,7 September 2021,"In the late 1960s and into the 70s, an unknown serial killer calling himself 'Zodiac' killed several people in the San Francisco area. How many exactly isn't certain, as the killed appears to have claimed credit for his crimes AND other crimes. In other words, he wanted credit for all sorts of murders...whether he committed them or not. What also makes him unusual is that the guy enjoyed taunting the police and newspapers....and he was also never caught. I mention this because it's all public record...and a search on Google will tell you the case was never solved. And, because of this, no matter how good the movie is (and it is very well made), it must end without the killer being caught.The story mostly is shown through the standpoint of a political cartoonist who worked for the San Francisco Chronical, Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal). However, it switches viewpoints several times....to other reporters as well as the police investigating the case. But it always comes back to Graysmith, as he's portrayed with being obsessed with the case...even more so than the police.I appreciated the film because it appears that the screenwriters did not take liberties with the story and they tried to get it right. This sort of thing is unusual as often films radically change the facts. But, because of this, I am sure many viewers felt cheated as there IS no solution to the case....and they really couldn't have one.",Zodiac
1,TheLittleSongbird,One of David Fincher's better movies,9,11 January 2011,"For me, it isn't his best, but it really is an impressive film. The best thing about Zodiac is its atmosphere, it is really quite chilling and affecting. Equally impressive is the story, it is a very intriguing one and told very cleverly as it probes the limits of knowledge and evidence with startling power. The script is very well written and really makes you think. And it isn't a David Fincher movie without great visuals and indeed Zodiac has that. The cinematography is really quite skillful and the scenery, locations and lighting match the brooding atmosphere wonderfully. Fincher also does a superb directing, in fact his direction is a primary factor in what makes Zodiac one of his better movies. This serial killer is also quite different, and this is in a good way. Fincher allows the brutality of the murders to take second place to how the investigation takes its toll on the protagonists, and I for one found that quite refreshing. The acting is equally good, Jake Gyllenhaal can be bland sometimes, but he has given some good performances too and his performance here is one of them. Mark Ruffalo is even better, and Robert Downey Jnr even more so. So overall, different but refreshing, clever and well made film and one of Fincher's better movies. 9/10 Bethany Cox",Zodiac
2,Leofwine_draca,Painstaking serial killer story might well be the director's best,9,7 December 2016,"David Fincher's laborious, incredibly detailed account of the infamous 'Zodiac' killings that shocked America in the late '60s is another feather in the hat of the auteur and ranks as one of his best films. The problem – if you can call it that – with Zodiac – is that it's incredibly long and you feel every second of the running time. It's a slow paced movie with little action, more of a police procedural as the viewer becomes enveloped in clues and mysterious over an incredibly long period. Fincher's aim is to recount every single little detail of what happens, and as usual for this director, not a second is wasted. He really gets across the lengthy, sometimes lethargic nature of the case and the boring minutiae of police work. I was entranced by all this but some might find it off-putting.In essence this film has two sides. The first is about the killer and the cops pursuing him. The opening hour focuses on shocking murder scenes and is pretty unnerving; the killer then slips into the background and we get involved in tons of theories and ideas about who he could be. The story brought new light to my understanding of the justice system and really envelops you – if you let it – in everything that's going on. The second side of the film is all about the leading character, Robert Graysmith, and his developing obsession with the crimes. It's one of the best portrayals of obsession I've seen on film, gruellingly realistic. Jake Gyllenhaal is pretty much wonderful in the movie and has his character just right.Fincher's attention to detail is second to none and the movie looks great, with top dollar cinematography. The script is full of fast and snappy dialogue and there's humour in surprising places to uplift some of the darker moments. The cast is also fine: Robert Downey Jr. continues his career redevelopment as the alcoholic reporter and Mark Ruffalo stands out as the dogged cop. Also look out for a show-stopping turn from Brian Cox, an ultra-creepy appearance from familiar character actor John Carroll Lynch, and an unrecognisable Anthony Edwards as Ruffalo's partner. As a whole the film has a sinister atmosphere with some truly unnerving moments (the phone calls and the visit to the basement spring to mind) and I enjoyed sitting through it. It's the kind of film you can quite happily lose yourself in, something Graysmith himself would readily identify with.",Zodiac
3,SnoopyStyle,immersive and detailed,8,18 January 2016,"On July 4, 1969, a killer shoots a couple on lovers' lane in Vallejo, California. The boy survives. The San Francisco Chronicle receives a letter from the Zodiac killer to print his letters with symbols. Reporter Paul Avery (Robert Downey, Jr) is on the case with the help of eager cartoonist Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal). The brutal murders continue moving to San Francisco. San Francisco police detectives Dave Toschi (Mark Ruffalo) and William Armstrong (Anthony Edwards) are given the case. Other police include Jack Mulanax (Elias Koteas) in Vallejo and Detective Ken Narlow (Donal Logue) in Napa. Defense lawyer Melvin Belli (Brian Cox) appearing on TV gets a call from the supposed killer.This starts off as an interesting serial killer mystery. The attacks are horrifically shown. The couple forced to be tied up and stabbed is probably the most memorable. However the movie turns into something deeper. This is not another serial killer movie like the endless TV shows that populate modern networks. It may not even be about the central characters. This is an immersive experience living with the serial killer always on the mind. The Zodiac killer is just out there in this world. It's fascinating in its dark undertones and the lack of flashiness.",Zodiac
4,Hitchcoc,The World Doesn't Work That Way!,8,16 November 2010,"This is a movie about process. It's about what happens when a case goes cold and simple answers don't suffice. It's a risk taken when one does a fictional presentation of an historical event from fairly recent times. You can stick tot he facts or simply make things up. I enjoyed this film because the three principle characters were real and human. All were in over their heads to some extent. Jake Gyllenhaal character makes that sometimes unfortunate serendipitous discovery and becomes obsessed. The police have done what they can, but without passion and this is what Gyllenhaal's character brings to the game. Unfortunately, so much time has passed and so much has gone cold. So everything is based on circumstance. We must content ourselves with what we find and give up on confessions or witnesses. I knew from the start what the case was about and I recommend that those sourpusses that complain about this film do a little reading (maybe one paragraph on Wikipedia which should handle your attention spans) and then decide whether you want to bother with this. Personally, I thought the acting was superb and it painted a picture of the frustration with trying to solve a case with only bits and pieces.",Zodiac
5,Prismark10,Mystery of the Zodiac killer,7,21 July 2014,"David Fincher manages to assemble some of the cast of The Avengers before Marvel Studios. Fincher again revisits the serial killer genre but this time based on true events of the Zodiac killer. The killings take place in the early part of the picture and although not graphic is still disturbing and eerie. The rest of the film deals with the police and press investigation in trying to unmask killer conveying the frustrating nature of the investigation that is still unsolved.The film gives us a narrative from the point of view of San Francisco Chronicle cartoonist Robert Graysmith who spent over 20 years obsessively trying to identify the killer and whose book the film takes inspiration from.The three leads Jake Gyllenhaal, Robert Downey Jr and Mark Ruffalo show zeal and frustration in equal measures as the exhaustive investigation over time places a burden on them all as they go round in circles with the evidence and suspects. The film believes that Robert Leigh Allen is the main suspect although the DNA case against him is unclear.The film is dense, thoughtful and at times seem slow. There is good photography and set design, showing San the Francisco of the late 1960s/early 1970s is not a simple task.",Zodiac
6,claudio_carvalho,Too Long and Boring,4,8 March 2008,"In the late 60's, a couple of teenagers is brutally murdered by a killer while dating nearby a lake in California. This is the beginning of a series of murders, with the criminal sending letters to the newspapers with riddles and promising more murders while the police force and journalists investigate the crimes trying to find suspects.I have recently seen Alexander Bulkley's ""The Zodiac"", which is based on the true events of the serial-killer Zodiac, and I found it a reasonable movie. Today I have just watched most of the 158 minutes running time version of David Fincher with my wife and when I did not sleep, I found it painfully long and boring (my wife agree with my opinion and she slept less than me). It is amazing that this overrated movie needs 158 minutes running time to tell the same story that ""The Zodiac"" tells in 97 minutes. If the viewer has insomnia problem, try to see this film instead of using sleeping pills because it will be more effective. My vote is four.Title (Brazil): ""Zodíaco"" (""Zodiac"")",Zodiac
7,nogodnomasters,THE MOST DANGEROUS GAME,6,26 June 2019,"This is a film about the infamous Zodiac killer. It starts in 1969 and spans over 2 1/2 hours to 1991, The film centers on Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhall) a cartoonist for the San Francisco Chronicle who is obsessed with solving the crime which involves a fellow reporter and numerous police officials. He accuses a number of suspects, each of which lacks for a hand writing or fingerprint match.The film shows a few murders, but is hardly gruesome. The exciting scenes consisted of opening letters from the zodiac and Jake scratching his head. It was a rather boring police drama.There is a cutout of ""Dirty Harry"" in one of the scenes, a man who got his ""zodiac style"" killer.Interesting as a history, but not as a crime drama.Parental Guide: no f-bombs, sex, or nudity.",Zodiac
8,kosmasp,Riddles and murders,9,26 October 2020,"A very tough movie to watch, that is based on real life incidents and crimes. So for those who know what went down or how this ended (or didn't), it may feel nice to see David Fincher staying as close to the facts as possible. Witness accounts sometimes varied - even with one and the same person changing their story or what they remembered happened. So Fincher had to decide how he'd go on about it and what he'd shoot.Now if you are not as aware of how it all went down, you may feel dissapointed of how this goes about it. Maybe not at the beginning but certainly towards the end. Although I reckon even those knowing how this ended might feel underwhelmed. Like how you know what happened with the Titanic, but then still be ""surprised"" by the Iceberg.Technically the movie is ace - the cast is superb, even in the smallest roles. Fincher is a master craftsman, even if some may feel sometimes (often?) his movies lack heart or whatever else they might want them to have. You can't fault him when it comes to filmmaking. That doesn't mean you will like this movie of course. It's very unique and very clinical. But still no matter what you know or don't, the suspense level is as high as it gets! Frustration may kick in - understandable! Imagine what the characters are going through - not just when the vivid murders happen, but generally speaking.A tough watch, that may not even be as ""rewarding"" in the usual sense as the viewer may wish it to be ... but that is why it's good and different ...",Zodiac
9,Sleepin_Dragon,Terrific movie.,9,4 September 2020,"Based on the wonderful novel, this film brilliantly tells the story of the unknown Zodiac killer, who operated in the late 60's and early 70's.You will easily lose a full night or afternoon with this movie, it's incredibly, it's engaging, dramatic, and captivating. I love how the time passes by on the film, everything changes accordingly, it's very well produced. At times it's very sinister, and creepy, but it's subtle, nothing is forced or heavy handed.The acting is terrific, Ruffalo and Downey are brilliant, a fresh faced Jake Gyllenhaal is arguably the one that steals the show.It really is a brilliant movie, I would recommend it highly. 9/10.",Zodiac
10,classicsoncall,"""This is the Zodiac speaking.""",8,24 December 2012,"Even living completely across the country in New York during the late Sixties/early Seventies, the Zodiac killer's crimes were front page headline stuff for a time. Quite honestly, I couldn't remember if the Zodiac was ever found, convicted, and sentenced for his murders. This film is a well paced if overlong study of the investigation into that string of murders, as well as one man's obsession with discovering the Zodiac's identity. The investigation turns up increasingly positive clues as well as frustrating dead ends on the part of police detectives working on the case, and if anything, one gains a certain appreciation for the kind of persistence and dedication they bring to their work. Because the legwork is so meticulous and exhaustive, it's frustrating to see how certain evidence winds up inadmissible, or how the input of a handwriting expert like Sherwood Morrill (Philip Baker Hall) is considered the final word on the subject to the exclusion of alternate considerations. As the picture progresses, Jake Gyllenhall takes center stage as the principal player obsessed with discovering the identity of the Zodiac, after months and years go by with leads exhausted and intermittent, circumstantial periods of time with no contact from the man claiming to be the killer. The viewers' own ideas about the case will either be hardened or rendered totally inconclusive once the picture is over, just as it was for the principal players in this daunting mystery which at this point will probably never be solved.",Zodiac
11,gavin6942,The First Real True Crime Epic... Truly Awesome,8,18 March 2007,"In 1969... a man started a crime spree that will forever haunt California and America. He called himself the Zodiac and taunted police officers and newspaper reporters. To this day (2007) he has never been caught and no one can prove his identity. This is the true story of one man's search for the Zodiac from the beginning until today.Unlike other serial killer stories, this one put the focus on the search rather than the killer. Yes, we have scenes with the Zodiac killing people. Yes, we have the police trying to catch Zodiac. And yes, we have the story of Paul Avery (Robert Downey Jr.) who became a potential target of the Zodiac after insinuating he was a ""latent homosexual"". But the story is most closely tied to Robert Graysmith, a cartoonist who picks up where Avery and the police left off, putting the puzzle together as his life falls apart. And that is a real human story underneath the murders and sensationalism.Director David Fincher, best known for ""Seven"" and ""Fight Club"", is back in top form here. He gets the right combination of the period piece (several decades are covered) and a hint of the film noir that makes this gritty story all the more dirty and suspenseful. Coming in at just under three hours, he knows how to grab the audience and hold them. How this will fare under repeated viewings I'm not sure (some of the mystery will be gone) but on the first take everything comes out close to perfection.Robert Downey, Jr. is a great actor. If you haven't seen ""The Singing Detective"", you should. But also, this film will give you a good sample of his ability to be both a loose cannon and a straight shooter. I actually wish he had been the lead, as I couldn't wait for each chance to see Downey perform. The lead, Jake Gyllenhaal, played a good Graysmith, but he seemed to me too young and fresh. Granted, the real story probably was very much like the way Gyllenhaal played it to be, but I found myself frustrated by having a hero who was so unsure of himself.Mark Ruffalo, like myself a Wisconsin native, was just as good as Downey. I freely admit I'm not familiar with his work, but here he was great as the animal cracker connoisseur and chief flatfoot. I cannot pinpoint for you what made him great, but I felt this character -- a man whose life was both consumed by the Zodiac while also trying in vain to run from the case.The supporting cast was wonderful. Elias Koteas (who you know best as Casey Jones from the ""Ninja Turtle"" films) was a great cop, Clea Duvall was an inmate (and didn't get nearly the screen time she deserves). Adam Goldberg is a reporter (and probably the wrong person to be cast in the role, despite his fine job). Chloe Sevigny was Graysmith's wife, and she really stands out as a great character and actress. I've long admired Sevigny since I first saw her, and as she's aged her choices of roles show she is a determined and focused actress. They are not glamorous parts (she is more plain here than ever before) but really important and strained roles fit only for professionals.The music here is great for setting the period (Donovan's ""Hurley-Gurly Man"" is the perfect choice for a theme) and it never seems to be sunny in San Francisco (this is that film noir feeling I mentioned). There is no aspect I can really say stands out as poor.My one concern, which is no fault of the film's, is how certain characters are strongly suggested to be the Zodiac. As these are real people, and there is no conclusive proof that they were or are the Zodiac, it seems in poor taste and disrespectful to the families to suggest such a thing. But I will not deny that some of the most tense and emotional scenes came when the police or Graysmith were face to face with people who might possibly have been a heartless killer.See this soon, because if you can it's one you'll want to see in the theater. Worth your time, worth your hard-earned funds, and an experience this epic should only be viewed with the best screen and the best sound. Most home systems simply will not do this one justice. As you can guess, I give this the highest possible recommendation.",Zodiac
12,lee_eisenberg,How could I have never heard of the Zodiac Killer until this came out?,10,5 August 2007,"Believe it or not, I had literally never heard of the Zodiac Killer until around the time that ""Zodiac"" got released in the theaters (cut me some slack; I was born many years after the killings took place). So, now I've seen the movie portraying everything surrounding the murders. I have to say that it's a really good movie. It focuses less on the murders themselves than on the investigations. The main character is actually Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal), a reporter for the San Francisco Chronicle. I, for one, was amazed at how he and the cops discovered the various patterns and clues. Therefore, maybe it helps if you nothing about the Zodiac Killer: everything in the movie is more of a surprise. As for the murderer's actual identity...well, in case you don't know the story, I won't spoil it.Aside from Gyllenhaal, there are other people doing great roles here. Robert Downey Jr. plays Graysmith's cohort Paul Avery. Avery sees his responsibility as a reporter, but personal problems impede his work; he's the type of wretch whom you can't help but admire. Mark Ruffalo plays cop Dave Toschi. Toschi is intent on solving the case and doesn't want the press interfering, but understands that he has to put up with the media. Also starring are Anthony Edwards, Brian Cox, Philip Baker Hall, Donal Logue, Chloe Sevigny, James LeGros and Candy Clark (I assume that she's the same Candy Clark who starred in ""American Graffiti"").All in all, I recommend this movie very much. I got the feeling that the tension between Graysmith and Toschi mirrored the tension that must have taken over San Francisco surrounding the murders. And as a side note, we get to hear some great music (e.g., Donovan's ""Hurdy-Gurdy Man""). A very good movie indeed.",Zodiac
13,jboothmillard,Zodiac,6,27 May 2011,"I heard about this film a reasonably high amount at the time of its release, mainly because of the cast and it being directed by David Fincher (Se7en, Fight Club, The Social Network), so I had to try it. Based on the true story, during the late 1960's and early 1970's there is a serial killer terrorising the San Francisco Bay Area, calling himself Zodiac, taunting the police with details of his victims and their bodies, and leaving cryptic messages at the scene of the crime. These letter are in a way clues as to his crime plans and his identity, and in this slightly fictionalised vision of events, we see the press and investigators trying to solve the case of this murderer. We see the investigations by crime reporter Paul Avery (Robert Downey Jr.) and police Inspector David Toschi (Mark Ruffalo), both not really getting anywhere, and then of course there is cartoonist San Francisco Chronicle worker Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal). He has a high interest in solving puzzles, e.g. crosswords, so with maybe a little help from the outside he sees it his mission to break the cryptic clues and catch the Zodiac killer, much to the annoyance of now alcohol drowning Paul. He obviously gains some support from David, and he also comes into contact with other people working on the case, such as handwriting expert Sherwood Morrill (Bruce Almighty's Philip Baker Hall), Linda del Buono (The Astronaut's Wife's Clea DuVall) who knew one of the Zodiac killer's victims, and key suspect Arthur Leigh Allen (Volcano's John Carroll Lynch). Of course the investigation becomes an obsession for Robert, so much so that he neglects and loses his wife Melanie (Chloë Sevigny) and family, as well as his job, but he continues nevertheless, the ending makes it unclear whether the investigation into the Zodiac is truly is over. Also starring Top Gun's Anthony Edwards as Inspector William Armstrong, Brian Cox as Melvin Belli, Who Framed Roger Rabbit's Charles Fleischer as Bob Vaughn, Zach Grenier as Mel Nicolai, Elias Koteas as Sgt. Jack Mulanax, Donal Logue as Captain Ken Narlow and My Best Friend's Wedding's Dermot Mulroney as Captain Marty Lee. I will admit I got lost slightly in a couple of places, and I think it could have been improved a little with more murders featured, but Gyllenhaal does well, Downey Jr. isn't bad, and Ruffalo gets his time, and of course the director does his best, it is in moments an engaging real life story, a watchable crime drama based on a true story. Good!",Zodiac
14,ccthemovieman-1,The All-Consuming Zodiac Killer,8,27 July 2007,"A couple of years ago, I read an article about how some people are still obsessed with the Zodiac serial killer case. Since the murderer was never apprehended, this case has fascinated a number of people for almost 40 years. There are websites and all kinds of people, apparently, who can't let go of this famous case. Lo and behold - here's a movie about that obsession. I, probably like a number of viewers, thought this was just another film about the murderer, and it looked that way for the first hour of the 157-minute movie. However, it turns out be just as much a story about one guy who has this obsession about finding the killer. That man is ""Robert Graysmith,"" a cartoonist for the San Francisco Chronicle. He is played by Jake Gyllenhaal. The movie is based on Graysmith's books on the Zodiac killer, so it's no surprise the story winds up revolving around him.For moviegoers looking for a hard-nosed, brutal serial-killer story, this must have been a disappointing film because it turns out to be a character study of ""Graysmith"" plus an in- depth behind-the-scenes look at police procedure which, as any cop could tell you, can be tedious work. However, there is still is enough violence and suspense, particularly early on, to satisfy some and there is a lot of information on the crimes itself, and a lot of suspects to entertain the ""whodunit"" mystery-solving viewer.I admit the story began to drag a bit after two hours but overall, I thought it was an intelligent, interesting profile of all concerned: most-likely killer, detectives, newsmen, witnesses, other suspects, Graysmith's wife - everyone who could possibly been involved with this long-standing unanswered crime case. In a way, this story reminded me of the CSI shows on TV where every five minutes we get a new can't-miss suspect who turns out to be a false lead. However, in this story, no one was ever tried and convicted. But, the movie does come to a conclusion on who the guilty party was, and makes a convincing case for it. Thus, at least according to the film, Mr. Graysmith's work was not in vain. (The real-life suspect died of a heart attack, so we may never know for sure.)The downside for Mr. Graysmith, and people we may not even know about, was that his life and others have been radically altered for the worse this obsession to find the Zodiac killer. It cost Mr. Graysmith his marriage.Overall, this is a bit long but it features excellent acting by everyone and offers diverse characters. I would like to have seen more with Arthur Allen. John Carroll Lynch is not a big- name actor but he's good and, for obvious reasons, a fascinating person in this story. Director David Fincher doesn't offer up the edge-of-your-seat thrillers as he did in ""Se7en"" and ""Panic Room,"" but this is still worth a look and recommended.",Zodiac
15,rmax304823,Unfinished Narrative.,5,23 August 2008,"The movie industry must be drawn to this story of the San Francisco Bay Area serial murderer like moths to a Klieg light and they always wind up irritated. The Zodiac narrative doesn't fit the required dramatic trajectory. Oh, the elements that have now become conventions are all there in the investigation -- the spooky killings, piecing the tesserae together into a mosaic with a pattern, the problem coordinating efforts between venues, the increasing number of incidents, the involvement of the press, the frustration of the police, the special investigative team, the obsessive pursuer, the red herrings, the ""good"" suspects who can't be pinned down -- but there is no climax! What is SUPPOSED to happen is that the killer is identified and finally captured, preferably after a chase, and preferably after a shoot out if possible, then brought to justice. The last shot of the movie ought to show either (1) the vicious murderer smiling behind bars or (2) the lead detective finally able to sleep peacefully, undisturbed by nightmares.Not here. Multiple characters weave their way in and out of the story, so many that some of us may lose track of who's who. Mainly we can identify Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal), his wife (Chloe Sevigny), reporter Paul Avery (Robert Downey, Jr.). and Inspector Toschi (Mark Ruffalo). We can identify them because they are familiar faces and because they show up on screen more often than others. And Jake Gyllenhaal is the especially perceptive cartoonist who is gradually swept up in the case, becomes possessed by it, and loses his family and his job in order to write the definitive book about it. I guess we remember Melvin Belli (Bryan Cox) too because he's so fluid. And we remember Arthur Leigh Allen (John Carroll Lynch) because he looks monumentally guilty.The story is all Gylenhaal's. He's the guy who cracks the code, does the leg work, amazes the police with his dedication, and virtually solves the case, though not to the satisfaction of the justice system. His chase, though ultimately fruitless, becomes frenzied. Well, it has to be the story of Graysmith and his sacrifices. He wrote the book the film is based on and he was technical adviser, along with his wife. If I were to be the adviser on a movie about MY life, my ex-wife would have had to leave because of my dedication to justice too, not because I kept a closet full of ladies' shoes or something. (No.) But then, why did the investigation become so fast and sweaty towards the end? The cops had long ago given up the case. Nothing was pending. There were no deadlines looming. The viewer senses chiefly that the pace must pick up speed because that's what the traditional narrative structure demands. The audience expects it. And, further, Graysmith must have found himself with a fascinating and commercial story that had no satisfactory ending, which is why Truman Capote was being driven nuts in the case of ""In Cold Blood,"" and delayed finishing the book until the killers were hanged.It isn't that there are no recurring treatments of unsolved murders. ""Lizzie Borden took an ax,"" etc. The Black Dahlia. And then there's Jack the Ripper. But the killers in these cases are safely dead, along with all the other real characters, and you can speculate about them as much as you like without fear of their taking legal redress. But with the Zodiac killer, who began his career in 1969 and, as far as we know, is still around, along with the victims and the agents of social control, conjecture has to be kept within the bounds of prudence. The result: an unfinished narrative, with everything left hanging in the air.It would have been nice if they'd caught the murderous, crowing lunatic. Not only would it have made a better book and better film, but he needs to suffer a little. As it stands, this movie provides us with all the details of the case we're likely to know. It's intelligently done. No exploding heads, no glitzy directorial displays, no lightning-fast editing. We're not likely to see a better description of the case on film.Yet the film leaves a sour taste. If the hero of the tale is Robert Graysmith (nee Robert Gray Smith), he's a flawed hero in real life and even in this screen portrayal. Or maybe it's just me. I'm chary of over achievers, especially reporters accused of plagiarism and suspected of forging one of Zodiac's letters, shopping his book around, looking so avidly for money and celebrity.",Zodiac
16,Tweekums,A cartoonist hunts for a serial killer,8,7 January 2017,"This films tells the story of the hunt for the infamous, who himself 'Zodiac', who has committed a series of murders in Northern California in the late sixties and early seventies. The crimes probably wouldn't have been linked if the killer hadn't contacted the police in each case then written to various newspapers listing his killings, which took place in different jurisdictions. His letter includes a code which he demands to be published. Both the police and the media work to identify the killer and as more letters arrive claiming responsibility for more murders and attempted murders as well as issuing a threat to target school children. As time passes various suspects emerge and are eliminated, largely due to handwriting evidence and there being no match for the fingerprint left at one of the crime scenes. Eventually the trail turns cold, the letters and killings stop and people gradually forget about the case except for Robert Graysmith of the San Francisco Chronicle; not as a reporter but as a cartoonist. Over the years he talks to witnesses and pours through police files until he finds a suspect he is convinced committed the killings.Director David Fincher did a fine job bringing this real life mystery to the screen It may have helped that all I knew about the case was that it inspired the film 'Dirty Harry' but I was gripped from the start. Thankfully the film doesn't dwell too much on the killings or even the killer; instead in concentrates on those investigating the case; how they go about trying to identify the killer and the effect their work has on their own lives. Jake Gyllenhaal does a fine job as protagonist Robert Graysmith making us believe in his obsession with the case. He is ably supported by Robert Downey Jr. who plays a colleague; Mark Ruffalo who plays the San Francisco detective leading the case and Chloë Sevigny who plays Graysmith's wife. Given that the original case is still officially unsolved there is no cast iron identification of the killer but those wanting resolution will be happy that by the end we are given a prime suspect and it is made clear that most of those involved are convinced of his guilt. There are a few shocking scenes early on and some tense moments later on but there is little that could be considered gratuitous and the film in no way glamourises the crimes or the chief suspect as some films in the genre do. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to people who enjoy a good mystery but don't demand that every loose end is wrapped up.",Zodiac
17,BA_Harrison,The J.F.K. of serial killer films.,5,5 August 2013,"For those deeply interested in the mystery of the Zodiac serial killer, this portrayal of one man's obsession with discovering the murderer's identity will no doubt qualify as essential viewing, dwelling as it does on the minutiae of the infamous unsolved case for a solid two and a half hours. Every possible avenue is examined in-depth; the script—based on the bestseller by Robert Graysmith—is exhaustive, charting the investigation of the killer's activity from the late 60s through to the early 90s. In its attention to detail, Zodiac is hard to fault.Unfortunately, in concentrating so hard on delivering the facts whilst avoiding sensationalism at all cost, director David Fincher neglects to engage those members of the audience who wish to be entertained as well as informed. With the exception of a brief moment of tension in a potential suspect's basement, the film never attempts to engage the viewer on an emotional level, and the result is a very dry watch—dare I say it, even boring at times. It's certainly nowhere near as memorable an experience as Fincher's other classic serial killer flick, Se7en (1995).",Zodiac
18,moonspinner55,A great crime puzzle...and one of Fincher's best films,7,5 November 2015,"A crackling good crime story from director David Fincher, who meticulously mounts this impeccable and brutal true-life mystery with aplomb. A serial killer self-nicknamed ""The Zodiac"" is terrorizing Northern California in the late-1960s. Jake Gyllenhaal is solid as Robert Graysmith, a divorced dad with two kids who's employed at the San Francisco Chronicle as the resident cartoonist; he becomes completely absorbed by the newspaper's reporting of (and the police department's concurrent investigation into) the series of grisly murders happening in and around the Bay Area. The film, based on Graysmith's non-fiction book by James Vanderbilt, is intense and unsettling, packing reams of detail and criminal minutiae into its running time--most of which dead-ends or winds up discarded (in a case that was never solved). Excellent performances by all, including Mark Ruffalo and Anthony Edwards as the two principle police inspectors on the case, also John Carroll Lynch as a factory worker and potential suspect. Not for every taste; however, as a portrait of hard-working people obsessed with solving a baffling case that dragged on for decades, it's quite riveting. Amazingly, no Oscar nominations. *** from ****",Zodiac
19,Quinoa1984,"not your typical serial killer movie; it's mystery about mystery, and with plot not as paramount as character and mood",10,4 March 2007,"David Fincher is back in action after a five year wait that is, at least for me, well worth the gap. Zodiac tests the boundaries of what can really be done in a genre that by now- and ironically by Fincher's own doing with Se7ven being such a huge success- has almost run its course. He reinvigorates it in a very deliberate, powerful manner by making this true story, like JFK, about what it is to investigate, and how investigating something like a murder (or in this case murders) has to be unraveled in a way to get one not even enveloped as to the end result but the process. It's epic length, or at least at 156 minutes really feels epic in scope, and it was the right decision not cut too much more out than Fincher did. But with this time given he is able to pay in many a suspenseful scene, and- to make another famous cinematic comparison- like Lang's M really becomes more fascinated by the process of how to make a criminal investigation a purely cinematic endeavor. It's also one of the year's best films.One of the things, for example, that had me impressed was the structure, of how plot itself was meant to be intricate and with all of the points of a case made to be important- hence all of the 'two days later' or 'twelve hours later' or 'a year and a half later'. We're getting the bulletin points, sure, but its a specific choice in how to follow the two sides, those at the San Francisco Chronicle (with the primary leads being Jake Gyllenhall's Robert Graysmith and Robert Downey Jr's Paul Avery) and with the police department (Mark Ruffalo's Detective Toschi), and how they interconnect and lead off into making this one big puzzle. It becomes a puzzle to which Graysmith, who ended up writing a book about the murders that never really got a person convicted for the crimes, becomes absorbed to the point of blocking everything else out of his life. This happens actually four years after the last main batch of letters were sent by the zodiac killer to the press, but this too adds to the intrigue and possible futility of Graysmith's personal investigation. He's not a reporter, but it's not about getting the main even exactly caught, but to, as he says, 'look him the guy in the eye'. It goes without saying that everything evidence-wise in the case, of course, is circumstantial.Aside from being top-notch in the realm of intelligent police procedurals, as well as a story of investigative journalism gone awry, Fincher puts on his a-game visually as well. It might not have the overload of visual tricks and inventive gags that Fight Club had, but within what Fincher needs he makes the picture as strong a directorial feat as he's ever done, maybe even his second best. The control of mis-en-scene is one aspect, and it's appropriate to note the usage of the opening studio logos like the 60s/70s logos, as it sometimes feels like watching one of those movies, while, of course, commenting on them as well (i.e. Dirty Harry movie scene). And also the little shots that stick in your mind, like the aerial view on top of the Golden Gate bridge, or those shots with the zodiac's handwriting super-imposed montage style over the scenes. His control is ever present, but not making it unbearable either; it's all about the story here, and character, and he keeps the darkness in close, precise check, and makes it maybe even more effectively ""moody"" as a noirish thriller than Se7en.Now, as for Graysmith, he's the one that ends up bringing out what is for Zodiac that center of making it about the ""journey instead of the destination"" as the saying goes. That cliché shouldn't be something to snort at, however, as it's a journey where since we already know what will come at the very end suspense has to come out of situations, and out of the finding, losing, and possibly attainable commodity of information. It's almost one big comment on those results-oriented police pictures, and I often felt more gripped and interested in individual scenes, moments. Two of my favorite are when Ruffalo's detective and Koetas's officer interrogate Leigh, where you think you know conventionally 'this is the killer, this is him', but it is not...or is it? Fincher keeps one guessing, as well as in another scene where Graysmith visits the former organ player at the silent theater Rick Marshall, who may or may not be the killer, was the projectionist (when they go into the basement especially is a classically charged scene).And there are other factors that make it sensational as well. It's another turn by Downey Jr where there's subtleties that only he can bring to a character like the flawed Avary. Gyllenhall's also a perfect choice for Graysmith, where naive ambition and interest get conveyed well early on, and then equally believable as the one-track-minded private investigator who pushes buttons but gets results. And the soundtrack is especially a keeper, with ""Hurdy Gurdy Man"" used to awesome effect for the opening July 4th scene and in the last scene (it might even send chills down some people's spines). It's never too slick but always an inviting trip, and it questions what it is that a serial killer mystery should be while giving it flair and a personal mark of distinction as a work in and of itself. Who is zodiac? A form of evil, perhaps, and a form of evil that one might just want a glimpse of, if only, as opposed to the whole found and captured result.",Zodiac
20,tavm,Zodiac was an excellent drama about the search for a real-life serial killer,10,1 September 2008,"When my dad decided to watch Zodiac, he asked if I wanted to join him. I agreed to even though the movie was 162 min. I was so enthralled I didn't care about the length after a while. Director David Fincher provides the most compelling drama of this real-life serial killer despite most of the scenes leading to several false leads and one man's complete obsession to get the right man. Jake Gyllenhaal is that obsessed man, a cartoonist named Robert Graysmith whose Eagle Scout demeanor leads to his determination of finding what makes this killer tick to the point of following reporter Paul Avery's (Robert Downey, Jr.) files and later browbeating police inspector David Toschi's (Mark Ruffalo) time. This then leads to a strained marriage with Melanie (Chloe Sevigny). Also of note are performances of Anthony Edwards (Inspector William Armstrong), John Caroll Lynch (suspect Arthur Leigh Allen), Brian Cox (lawyer Melvin Belli), Richmond Arquette, Bob Stephenson, and John Lacey (other Zodiac killer suspects). The whole thing just enthralled me from beginning to end and I especially was on the edge of my seat when Graysmith visited this man's house who used to work at a theatre where a Zodiac suspect was a projectionist. So on that note, I highly recommend David Fincher's Zodiac.",Zodiac

Highlight ""superbly crafted"" and ""outstanding ensemble."" Screenwriter James Vanderbilt does a great job scripting the original material from the true account books authored by ""San Francisco Chronicle"" cartoonist Robert Graysmith, who turned himself into a long-suffering chief investigator in the unsolved ""Zodiac"" case. Possibly, the film's one main weakness is that it hesitates in offering a satisfactory conclusion; the thesis points in one direction, with strong circumstantial evidence (many cases have nothing but), and re-opens the case with wordy end notes.The performances are uniformly excellent, with Mr. Gyllenhaal always clearly in the lead, playing the fresh-faced political cartoonist fascinated by the dark killer; it is his character's story, after all. The main supporting actors are police investigator Mark Ruffalo (as Dave Toschi) and newspaperman Robert Downey Jr. (as Paul Avery). These three men approach the ""Zodiac"" killer from different angles, and could be counted among his secondary victims; they lose (unequal) parts of their lives while questing the beast.Most valuable player is clearly versatile director David Fincher, who knows the precise style with which to deliver the otherwise unappealing narrative; with a perfect cast and crew, Mr. Fincher steadily builds interest. This is one of 2007's best productions, and Fincher most deserved some ""Best Director"" notice; in hindsight, his work will marked up.

24,sunwarrior13,It Is A Great Film,10,3 September 2012,"Zodiac is a mystery film directed by David Fincher and based on Robert Graysmith's non-fiction book of the same name. It stars Jake Gyllenhaal, Mark Ruffalo, and Robert Downey, Jr.Zodiac tells the story of the hunt for a notorious serial killer known as ""Zodiac"" who killed in and around the San Francisco Bay Area during the late 1960s and early 1970s, leaving several victims in his wake and taunting police with letters and ciphers mailed to newspapers.A relentless serial killer is stalking the streets of the San Francisco Bay Area, leaving citizens locked into a constant state of panic, and baffled authorities scrambling for clues. Though the killer sadistically mocks the detectives by leaving a series of perplexing ciphers and menacing letters at the crime scenes, the investigation quickly flatlines when none of the evidence yields any solid leads. As two detectives remain steadfast in their devotion to bringing the elusive killer to justice, they soon find that the madman has control not only over their careers, but their very lives as well. The case remains one of San Francisco's most infamous unsolved crimes.The true story behind the murders that many crime scholars believe to be the most perplexing series of unsolved crimes in modern history comes to the screen in chilling detail.A quiet, dialogue-driven thriller that delivers with scene after scene of gut-wrenching anxiety. David Fincher also spends more time illustrating nuances of his characters and recreating the mood of the 70s than he does on gory details of murder.Also,what makes Zodiac authentic is the way it avoids chases, shootouts, grandstanding and false climaxes, and just follows the methodical progress of police work.

26,hitchcockthelegend,Peerless precision from Fincher.,10,4 March 2008,"I have seen it written that this film shows that Fincher had grown up, and whilst I understand that train of thought, it simply isn't true. What Fincher has done is give a true story his meticulous care and standard deft precision by leaving no stone unturned. We get simply one of the (if not thee) best films to deal with the investigating process of a high profile serial killer, a film that as a character study is actually essential viewing in the pantheon of genre productions.The devilish greatness of this film is in the fact that it can't pay off with a pandering mainstream ending, the makers are telling a true story and any sort of research will lead viewers to the fact that there is no twist here, no joyous ticket selling round of applause at this ending, it is what it is, frustratingly brilliant. The case the film is about consumes all involved with it, and to see how it affects those involved is engrossing (yet sad) because if the viewer is so inclined to jump on board then it will consume you as well, the film and the actors within demand you see this for the affecting character piece it is.The acting here gives me hope that classic acting is alive and well in this generation, I was once not enamoured with Mark Ruffalo in his early days as an actor, but here he puts such heartfelt verve into the role of David Toschi I felt I need to send him a written apology!. Robert Downey Junior is joyous as Paul Avery, all 60s chic and swagger without tipping over the edge of the mountain caricature (both men to become future Avengers of course). Yet surprisingly to me I found that it is Jake Gyllenhaal as Robert Graysmith who is the film's key axis, the central heartbeat, with a performance that demands undivided attention, a performance brought about by Fincher's quest for perfection from everything to do with film making. Gyllenhaal hated working on the film, he hated Fincher's work ethic, but in time he must now look back and see that here the director coaxed out a performance that has in time been seen as not only great, but also beneficial to his career (hello Nightcrawler).This is not Se7en 2, and British film mags like Empire should have known better than to use that tag line to get the readers' attention, because fans of serial killer thrillers need not apply here, fans of outstanding cinema about the human psyche during the pursuit of a serial killer - Well get in line folks, for this is one of the best movies of the decade. 10/10",Zodiac
27,Hey_Sweden,A *very* long but extremely engrossing film.,9,18 May 2018,"The real-life Zodiac murders that plagued the Bay Area in the late 1960s make for great drama in this, one of David Finchers' finest achievements as a director. The ""Zodiac"", as he dubs himself, delights in taunting the cops and mailing letters to them, while obviously enjoying being one step ahead of them most of the time.However, the film doesn't really focus on him. Some of the murders are re-enacted, but this story focuses on the people who hunted the killer down, in particular Dave Toschi (Mark Ruffalo), who inspired the Steve McQueen performance in ""Bullitt"", and Bill Armstrong (Anthony Edwards). It's only in the last hour or so of ""Zodiac"" that it fully becomes the story of Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal), a cartoonist for the San Francisco Chronicle who becomes obsessed with playing amateur detective, and keeping the case alive when everybody else has seemingly given up.Although this would seem to be unwieldy at two hours and 37 minutes (two hours and 43 minutes if you're watching the directors' cut), it remains utterly absorbing throughout, making the most of the police-procedural aspect of the storytelling. The material IS rather fascinating, remaining one of the most fascinating unsolved cases of all time.Towards the end, the narrative does become awfully familiar, as Graysmith alienates his wife (Chloe Sevigny, who is unfortunately not given anything really interesting to do) and ropes his kids into helping him work the clues. It's no surprise when she takes the kids and hauls ass out of there.Yet, as portrayed by Gyllenhaal, a very fine actor indeed, the mans' earnestness does make him a reasonably likeable character. And ""Zodiac"" also offers impressive showcases for a rich variety of supporting actors: Robert Downey, Jr., Brian Cox, Elias Koteas, John Carroll Lynch (who plays the late Arthur Leigh Allen, the person who remained the prime suspect for a long time), John Getz, John Terry, Candy Clark, Dermot Mulroney, Donal Logue, Philip Baker Hall, Zach Grenier, John Mahon, Adam Goldberg, James Le Gros, Charles Fleischer, and Clea DuVall. The scene in Fleischers' basement late in the film is brilliantly creepy.Fincher and company took themselves very seriously in making this film, and it shows. They were supposedly real sticklers for detail, using Graysmiths' books and actual case files as their source material. They also refrain from making this all about Zodiac, not bothering to re-enact those murders which had no witnesses or survivors. The documentary-style approach ultimately works wonders; there's very little room for melodrama, or overstatement. Set largely in the 1970s, emulation of that era is well done, including a score by veteran composer David Shire and a vintage opening Paramount logo sequence.While this viewer would hesitate to come right out and call this ""perfect"", he will say that it does come pretty close, entertaining and informing its audience and never making the film seem as long as it is.Nine out of 10.",Zodiac
28,Doylenf,"Suspenseful thriller is based on true, unsolved case...excellent performances...",7,2 August 2007,"ZODIAC starts off with a bang, and then gets so bogged down in intense detective work that the thriller aspect is diluted by the time the first hour is over. Furthermore, since the case was never really solved, there's no real payoff at the end--just more speculation.Despite this, it manages to hold the attention for well over two hours with a tale that zig-zags back and forth between a newspaper (The San Francisco Chronicle), its crime reporter (ROBERT DOWNEY, JR.) and cartoonist (JAKE GYLLENHAAL), and the police force with MARK RUFFALO as the lead detective on the case and his partner (ANTHONY EDWARDS) both committed to finding the Zodiac killer.The clever murderer keeps the police at bay over a period of years and still they try to uncover each clue and spend a great deal of time working on the unsolved murders that eventually claim some thirteen lives. The first murders are staged brilliantly by director David Fincher, and the film becomes a gripping search for the sadistic killer. But after the murder of a taxicab driver, the film veers into detective work with a penchant for detail that soon becomes bogged down in too much exposition.JAKE GYLLENHAAL is excellent as the boyishly enthusiastic cartoonist who soon becomes obsessed by the case. He's the one who eventually wrote two books on the subject. His scariest moment comes toward the end of the film when he's invited to the home of an acquaintance of the killer hoping to glean some important information. His fear and horror that the man might be the killer himself almost makes up for the fact that the story has no real solution. It's a brilliantly staged scene with his panic attack never overplayed.The other performances are uniformly good, but it's Gyllenhaal who does the most convincing job in the central role. Sad to see DERMOT MULRONEY wasted in the small role of a police captain.Summing up: Suspenseful and well directed, but loses some momentum when it shifts from the horrific murders to the relentless detective work.",Zodiac
29,preppy-3,It was OK but has serious problems,6,11 March 2007,"Movie based on the unsolved Zodiac killings in California in the 1960s-1970s. A man was killing people with no rhyme or reason and sent notes to California newspapers daring them to figure out who he was. Reporter Paul Avery (Robert Downey Jr.) and cartoonist Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal) try to figure out who he is while police inspector Davod Toschi (Mark Ruffalo) and his partner (Anthony Edwards) try to catch him.This film has a lot of good things going for it--it's well directed (excellent use of wide screen), has some good acting (especially by Downey) and manages to wring some suspense out of the story despite the fact that you know how it ends. There's also good supporting performances by Chloe Sevigny and Dermot Mulroney. Still this film has three serious problems. One is Gyllenhaal. He is a good actor but appears totally out of his depth here. He wears one expression the entire movie and his acting quickly becomes annoying. The second is the length of this movie--it's way too long. It rambles on for 160 minutes and gets tedious more than once. I kept looking at my watch and more than once considered leaving. I stayed because I figured I had paid my $10.00 so--why not? Also the story keeps jumping around and, if something has nothing to do with the killer, it's tossed off casually.For example...Sevigny is introduced as a date of Gyllenhaal. We don't see her until about 30 minutes later and by this time she's his wife AND they have kids! No mention was made of them getting married or having kids. This is a little thing but it caught my attention and was distracting.So--it has good acting and direction but goes on far too long and was too disjointed. I give it a 6.",Zodiac

The fact that it takes its toll on anyone caught in this sprawling Case that has so many superfluous facts and figures that the Mind boggles and the Spirit wanes. One who does not wane is the obsessive/compulsive Cartoonist who in the end found that there was no end.

Disorienting only in that this is more or less a straight telling of how three men's lives were changed by the killings. The cast is a cross the board excellent with Robert Downey Jr a stand out as the reporter who sinks into alcoholism as the elusive case gets away. Following Robert Greysmith's book on the story fairly closely this is a gripping tale that will annoy some people since, and its not rally giving anything away, there is no definitive ending. The killer isn't caught, though a suspect is named. For me the problem is tied together in the fact that we are asked to give up three hours of our lives to a story that has no, and will probably never have, final solution. While the lack of an ending makes you feel much like the characters on the screen it also annoys you and makes wanting to return to the film again not something you'd look forward to. Don't get me wrong, I really like the film a great deal (I've read a lot on the killings) I just wish they had managed to find a more satisfying way to end the film so I'd have a reason to go back to it sooner rather than later.

32,CinemaSerf,Slow and steady serial killer investigation.,7,14 September 2020,"This is a curious film to watch - the pace is almost as slow as the fifteen year timespan in which it takes for cartoonist Jake Gyllenhaal. journalist Robert Downey Jnr and detective Mark Ruffalo to investigate the Californian ""Zodiac"" murders from the 1960/70s. The lack of pace is not a bad thing - indeed, what it does demonstrate quite clearly is the lack of co-ordination as the investigations are carried out methodically, but not cohesively, with contradicting evidence from the killer who had a penchant for writing coded letters to the police and the press but remaining steadfastly elusive being inconsistently appraised. In the end, the film isn't really about the murderer - it is about the impact he has on the three men trying to identify and apprehend him, and with a gentle blend of fiction added to the fact we share a genuine feeling of the exasperation and frustration each man (and their families) go through as their search borders on the obsessive. The narrative is a bit wobbly at times, but the characterisations make up for that in quite a satisfactory - if not mind blowing - manner and I did feel myself being drawn into the mystery in quite a compelling way, too. It is a long watch, and after the first rather brutal (though not graphically so) twenty minutes is takes on the guise of a delicate cat and mouse game that requires patience to enjoy - but I think it is worth it.",Zodiac
33,Bunuel1976,"ZODIAC (David Fincher, 2007) ***",7,10 July 2007,"David Fincher’s fifth feature film takes him back to the territory of his second film and greatest success, SEVEN (1995) – the serial killer theme. Here, however, he concerns himself with a real-life, unsolved case which shocked – and fascinated – America for the best part of 20 years. The film is quite long at 158 minutes, but the intriguing subject matter and the incredibly detailed scrutiny of the case makes for compulsive, if occasionally heavy-going, viewing.The film basically divides itself into three sections – the first part deals with Robert Downey Jr.’s troubled crime reporter (he actually became a target for the killer at one point and eventually self-destructs in a haze of boozing lethargy), the second with the police investigation itself – conducted by Mark Ruffalo and Anthony Edwards – and especially the effects it has on the former’s career (he is eventually taken off the case and transferred to another division for tampering with the evidence) and, finally, cartoonist Jake Gyllenhaal’s obsessive odyssey to decipher, track and eventually meet the Zodiac which takes its toll on his family life and costs him his job at the paper.Overall, the film is of a high quality on a technical level with any number of impressive scenes (the opening murder sequence to the strains of Donovan’s “Hurdy Gurdy Man” is a cracker) and a couple of good performances (particularly Downey’s and Brian Cox’s psychoanalyst) but it does have its undeniable flaws, too: the characters played by Gyllenhaal and Ruffalo come off as unsympathetic when contrasted with Downey’s effortless charisma, there is perhaps too many newspaper conferences and not enough depictions of the murders, there is certainly little or no attempt to identify the cause of Zodiac’s behavior and, after almost three hours and after all those years, the prime suspect is still the same one (although I can’t say I was completely convinced of it myself) despite the occasional, effective red herring (apparently being an old movie buff is a pre-requisite for serial killer suspects). In hindsight, it seems incredible now that it took the various investigating forces 22 years to track down the one surviving victim of the Zodiac killings but, by that time, the prime suspect would go on to die of a heart attack… Finally, one thing I especially liked was that the Zodiac was apparently inspired to commit his crimes by a classic horror movie, THE MOST DANGEROUS GAME (1932) – while his own exploits themselves inspired an iconic piece of cinema, DIRTY HARRY (1971)!",Zodiac

I have to say that I knew nothing about the real events which the film depicts except for reading a couple of reviews since it opened her on Friday and catching a screening on Sunday. There are elements of All The President's Men in the painstaking and often frustrating piecing together of information and unlike All The President's Men the issue here is never resolved satisfactorily. The thing that stands out is not so much how many people Zodiac killed as how many lives he impaired amongst his pursuers in the police force and media. The actors are excellent right across the board and it would be unfair to praise one or two at the expense of another half dozen or so.

37,Boba_Fett1138,In the search for truth and answers.,8,12 November 2007,"The movie is a realistic retelling of the events involving the Zodiac killer. Crimes that as of yet still haven't been solved. The movie is told from many different viewpoints, such as the reporters that receive his letters and the police. Because of the different approaches the movie always knows to grab your attention and interest, without having to ever fall back onto some Hollywood clichés. It of course helps that the writer of the novel Robert Graysmith worked himself on this movie project for years. The story at all times is kept realistic. Some people might find it odd and distracting that the movie focuses on so many different characters and the movie doesn't really have one main character who's solving the crimes.What I loved most about the movie was that it without problems crosses 4 different decades. The movie begins in the late '60's, then the '70's and for a small part even the '80's and '90's. The atmosphere, style of movie-making is all consistent with the decade the movie is set in at the moment. The movie knows to re-create a perfect '60's and '70's look, in a very detailed and realistic way. I think this mostly explains the movie its very high budget.The movie also shows how an interest for something can turn into an obsession. It does this subtle and non-forced. I also liked it that the movie never got too personal or close with any of the characters within the movie. This type of movie could had easily been turned into a over-dramatized one, but the movie deliberately focuses purely on the one main essence of the movie; Who is the Zodiac killer? A question that of course gets never answered within the movie but the search for the answer alone is already a tense and exciting long process.The movie is filled with some big-name actors, such as Robert Downey Jr. I like how he always seems to play a caricature of himself. And eccentric, free-spirit, drug/drink addict. He's great in his role in this movie! Jake Gyllenhaal has never convinced me before of being the right man- and have the capabilities of playing a main character and carry an entire movie but with this movie he comes close of showing he can do it. Other actors that give a nice performance in this movie are Mark Ruffalo and Elias Koteas, among others, while other big name actors play some very small parts in the movie, such as Brian Cox, Adam Goldberg and Clea DuVall.It's far from David Fincher's best work, but that says more something about the qualities of Fincher than about this actual movie.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Zodiac

But I just felt that some of the scenes could have been cut back on or taken out entirely. It moves too slow for my taste, especially in the first half.The movie almost seems split into two parts, the police trying to solve the murders, then jake gyllenhaals character trying to solve the murders. I found that the second half moved faster and was more intense and exciting. In the first half they focus too much on RDJs character.",Zodiac
39,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Had me watching closely,8,25 August 2009,"I didn't know anything about the Zodiac killer before watching this, though I understand that it is a meticulous recreation of the facts, slightly dramatized. Thus, I cannot provide any comparisons to neither what people remember from the actual case nor the novel, I'm afraid. The plot is interesting and the mystery compelling. While this moves at a deliberate pace, it genuinely does not stop being engaging. This took chances, for a mainstream film, all of them justified, and the majority of them working out. It's nice to see Fincher dialing his style back, and going for a traditional, and in no way fancy or dolled up, presentation, that allows the audience to focus on what is said and what clues are provided. The content, not the form, is the focus here. Dialog is nicely sharp and well-delivered, without being overly swift. The acting is strong, and you can tell that the cast consists almost entirely of big names. Most of the music is great. The cinematography and editing are well-done, and as already mentioned, kept relatively simple. This doesn't have as much suspense as one might expect, but what there is, is effective; the threat feels real. The DVD holds three trailers, one for the Director's Cut release of this, one for 300, and one for Blood Diamond, as well as a featurette I will review on its own page. I recommend this to anyone who likes viewing crime-solving fiction. Just know that this is about the process. 8/10",Zodiac

41,view_and_review,One of the More Popular Unsolved Mysteries,7,29 March 2021,"The case of the Zodiac killer, much like Jack the Ripper, is one of those very popular unsolved mysteries. ""Zodiac"" spans 22 years and covers just about every important figure in the case: Paul Avery (Robert Downey Jr.) and Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal) from the S. F. Chronicle, David Toschi (Mark Ruffalo) and William Armstrong (Anthony Edwards) from the SFPD, and others. The movie is not very suspenseful as you'd expect a movie to be about a serial killer. There's never a first person perspective from the killer, never a person in peril waiting to be saved, or a close encounter when the police just miss nabbing him. ""Zodiac"" is a two-and-a-half-hour puzzle that is slowly being solved. It's a bit frustrating because of how we've been conditioned when it comes to crime thrillers, but considering this is based upon real life you have to give it a little leeway.",Zodiac

But it is a constantly moving affair - its 2 hours and 40 minutes are never spent standing still.Although the killings are (shockingly) included as part of the narrative, the film is more concerned by the effect the seemingly endless efforts to identify the Zodiac killer have on those engaged in the search. These include Mark Ruffalo's detective, Robert Downey Jr's loose cannon reporter, and Jake Gyllenhaal's obsessed cartoonist.The performances are uniformly excellent and the story, told in chronological sequence right up to its apparent end, is never less than gripping.An absorbing 160 minutes' viewing.",Zodiac
43,evanston_dad,Not Your Average Serial Killer Movie (And That's a Good Thing),9,26 March 2007,"""Zodiac"" may frustrate viewers who come to David Fincher's latest film expecting a traditional serial killer thriller. The film begins with a couple of hair-raising and rather brutal recreations of murders carried out by the mysterious killer who terrorized the San Francisco Bay area in the late 1960s and early 1970s. These early scenes are shocking and, compared to the rest of the film, disorienting, because they offer the only time that we come close to seeing events from the killer's perspective. As the film progresses, the Zodiac killer himself fades into the background, and the movie turns into a meticulous and engrossing document of the investigation to track him down, an investigation that includes countless blind alleys and false clues and which to this day has not reached a conclusion. I would be more prone to label the somewhat rambling screenplay as sloppy storytelling if I did not feel that Fincher tells the story exactly as he wants to. The elusive narrative works, because the film is about an elusive villain.Jake Gyllenhaal plays Robert Graysmith, a cartoonist working for the ""San Francisco Chronicle"" at the time the Zodiac killer began his gruesome work. He becomes fascinated by the case, and takes it on as a sort of morbid personal hobby long after the police department has given it up as a lost cause. Graysmith eventually wrote the book on which this film is based, and according to his accounts, he discovered enough evidence about one of the suspects in the case to put the police back on his trail years after he'd been cleared for lack of evidence. Other characters come and go. Robert Downey, Jr. does characteristically terrific work as a reporter at the ""Chronicle"" who grabs his own portion of notoriety through his involvement in the case. Mark Ruffalo and Anthony Edwards play the two detectives in charge of the investigation. Chloe Sevigny plays Gyllenhaal's put-upon wife, who gradually loses her husband to his obsession. All of the actors deliver thrilling performances, many of them against the odds. Since this isn't a character driven movie, many of the characters remain undeveloped, but not, for once, to the detriment of the film. This story isn't about the people involved, but rather about their role in the Zodiac saga; once they've served their purpose, Fincher dispenses with them. Ironically, a film that clocks in at nearly 3 hours exhibits a great deal of narrative economy.Parts of ""Zodiac"" are intensely creepy. Fincher effectively uses the rainy San Francisco atmosphere to its maximum potential, and the grimy browns and grays of the production design call to mind Fincher's other well-known films, like ""Seven"" and ""Fight Club."" But ""Zodiac"" is much more grown up than those films, and for an audience to enjoy it, it has to have an attention span. Long scenes are given to analyzing handwriting samples, recreating the scenes of murders, digging through newspaper clippings and files. You can tell that Fincher is fascinated by police work in the pre-CSI era, when fax machines were still a novel invention. He delves into the investigative process with a nearly fetishistic attention to detail, but he makes all of it endlessly mesmerizing. He does his best to bring everything to some sort of conclusion, but the real-life end to the story makes a complete conclusion impossible. This film is more about the journey than the destination, and what a journey it is.Grade: A",Zodiac
44,ferguson-6,The Most Dangerous Game,8,3 March 2007,"Greetings again from the darkness. Based on the true story of the 25 year search for the Zodiac killer ... a serial killer who's multiple homicide's (somewhere between 13-51) remain unsolved. The source material for the film is the book ""Zodiac Unmasked"" by Robert Graysmith portrayed by Jake Gyllenhaal.Despite common knowledge that the case remains unsolved, director David Fincher (""Fight Club"", ""Seven"") creates a good deal of suspense and captures the frustration of those who spent years chasing this monster. The lead detectives are played by Anthony Edwards and Mark Ruffalo. Other key law enforcement officials are played by Donal Logue, Elias Koteas and Dermot Mulroney. Brian Cox and Philip Baker Hall have key support roles and the great Chloe Sevigny is cast as Gyllenhaal's wife. I must mention the single scene featuring Clea Duvall as an inmate with some insight. Always nice to see her work. In a very interesting selection, the main suspect (Arthur Lee Allen) is played by John Carroll Lynch, the gentle husband in ""Fargo"".The film has a couple of confusing moments or loose ends ... such as the entire sequence when Gyllenhaal interviews the former movie theatre manager. However, I would compare the film to ""All The President's Men"" in its structure of presenting the investigation of the mystery. Robert Downey, Jr. is once again remarkable, this time as the lead San Francisco Chronicle reporter who is threatened by Zodiac. Downey's subsequent breakdown is realistic and painful.Although not much humor exists in the film, I couldn't help but chuckle as Gyllenhaal and Ruffalo are trading ideas in a late night café. You couldn't find two actors with bigger puppy dog eyes than these two! Still, it doesn't ruin the intensity and Fincher does a great job at capturing the desperation of Ruffalo and Gyllenhaal throughout the film ... as each of their lives begin to crumble.Justice can be a very complicated manner, but I believe Graysmith feels that his final connection with the main suspect was all he needed to complete his story and put his mind at ease. The man was not locked up, but the mystery was now unlocked. For those who enjoy the investigative side of crime, this one is definitely worth seeing. Two interesting notes ... the soundtrack contains an almost overwhelming number of period songs, and don't miss the cameo from Ione Skye, who's father Donovan's ""Hurdy Gurdy Man"" has a key role on the soundtrack.",Zodiac

47,gradyharp,Obsession,8,26 July 2007,"David Fincher knows how to go straight to the bone, whether that be by grisly effects or wearing down the psyches of his audience. In ZODIAC he traces the very long investigation of the serial killer in the 1960s and 1970s in the San Francisco area who was never found and has managed to mimic that interminably long yet fascinating exploration by taking close to 3 hours to unravel the bits and pieces of evidence that were to confound the police and the press alike. Based on the book by Robert Graysmith (the SF Chronicle cartoonist who became obsessed with the conundrum of the murders) and adapted for the screen by James Vanderbilt, ZODIAC holds the viewers' attention by its smart, edge of the seat development of what could easily been a too-long-song of a docudrama.Much of the success of the film is due to Fincher's pacing and yet a great deal of the credibility of the story falls in the capable hands of a very fine cast. Jake Gyllenhaal portrays the obsessed Graysmith, a man whose life as a cartoonist for the newspaper and as a husband to Melanie (Chloë Sevigny) and father to three children is gradually broken by his preoccupation with finding the serial killer named Zodiac. He is well supported by Mark Ruffalo as Inspector David Toschi and Anthony Edwards as Inspector William Armstrong, Robert Downey as the alcoholic reporter James Avery, Brian Cox as Melvin Belli, and Elias Koteas, John Carroll Lynch and others in brief but very important cameo roles.For some the film may feel like a long frustrating bore, but magnify that by the real life situation the Zodiac killer created over extended years and the frustration of the forces who wouldn't let the case die will be realized. Obsession such as this takes patience. The payoff is well worth it. Grady Harp",Zodiac
48,The_Void,Well done true crime flick,9,30 September 2007,"David Fincher really made his mark 12 years ago with the excellent 'Seven'. Since then, however, he's been disappointing - Fight Club was massively overrated, while The Game and Panic Room were both merely decent thrillers - but it would seem that Fincher is (nearly) back to his best with Zodiac - a sprawling epic mystery/crime thriller based around a real life unsolved crime. This is no doubt a very ambitious film - it doesn't quite work as a rounded whole - for a start, the characters don't really get time to develop well - but all in all, Zodiac is certainly a very good film. The film is based on books by Robert Graysmith and follows the events surrounding the Zodiac, an anonymous killer who murdered several people in the late sixties and early seventies. The film follows reporters and police officers as they investigate the Zodiac killings and endeavour to find out the identity of the killer. Eventually, the protagonists end up becoming obsessed with this investigation and the Zodiac consumes them...The film is extremely well put together as you would expect, and Fincher has done an excellent job of recreating the time period in which the film is set. As the story spans over several years, the film does tend to make jumps from one time to another often, and this means that the characters and their personal situations have to take a backseat to the investigation, which is the backbone of the film. This is the way that the film has to be otherwise it would have ended up going on for several hours...but it does mean that the film doesn't feel like a complete whole. Zodiac is lead by three good central performances, Jake Gyllenhaal never really looked 'obsessed' to me, but at least he's an engaging lead. Mark Ruffalo was an odd choice for the police officer role, but it seems to be the right choice - and the film is topped off by Robert Downey Jnr, who gives yet another memorable performance. The mystery itself was enough to keep me interested, the ending was always going to be disappointing, but the film does manage closure in spite of the real life details of the case. Overall, Zodiac falls short of being a masterpiece; but it's certainly a very good thriller and it comes recommended.",Zodiac
49,zetes,Great flick. Can't wait for the special edition DVD!,9,26 August 2007,"Although I've pretty much despised every film David Fincher has made up to this point, I'd always readily admit that he was a pretty good director. If only he had decent material. Zodiac is a super-detailed account of the Zodiac murders that occurred in California in the late '60s through the mid '70s, one of the most famous unsolved cases in American history. One would expect, given the director's previous Se7en, that the film would be horrifyingly gory and unrelentingly nasty. The big surprise is that it isn't at all. We do witness several of the murders, but Fincher doesn't attempt to gross the audience out as he did in Se7en. This is all done in a matter-of-fact way, in the manner of a procedural. It's amazing the way that Fincher and screenwriter James Vanderbilt, as well as Robert Graysmith, who wrote a book on the subject and is one of the key participants in the story (played by Jake Gyllenhaal), construct the screenplay. They feed us just tons of details, but it doesn't at all feel like a dull list. The story also skips ahead in time constantly. Every few minutes, there's a new subtitle, telling us that this is ""4 months later"" or whatever. It's easy to lose the mood with such a fragmented structure, but Zodiac works perfectly. What's really amazing is how the details build. They're absorbed by the audience. There's so much there that, by the end of the film, everyone looks like they could be the Zodiac. It's a great film, one of the best procedural films ever done, and one of the best, so far, of 2007.btw, rent, don't buy, the first, bare bones edition of the DVD. The studio was desperate to release it, but Fincher has been working on a director's cut and tons of extras. The better DVD should be along sometime early in 2008.",Zodiac
50,Sylviastel,A Fine Adaptation of the Book!,8,15 March 2012,"Jake Gyllenhall does an admirable job in playing Robert Graysmith, a San Francisco cartoonist, for the San Francisco Chronicle as the Zodiac Killer becomes known in 1969 and through the 1970s. The Zodiac killer's identity has eluded police even those like Graysmith who become obsessed with the case even risking his marriage and his relationship with his young children. Robert Downey Jr. played Paul Avery, the reporter, in a suitable performance. The rest of the cast is first rate with Chloe Sevigny playing Melanie Graysmith;Dermot Mulroney as a cop; John Carroll Lynch as Lee; and others. The Zodiac story still has eluded police to this day but the story is a fascinating part of history. The victims aren't forgotten but the Zodiac's prime suspect has disappointing results. Despite it all, the Zodiac still eludes us to this day. Who was he and why did he do it? More important was his relationship with the press and the police. He seemed to enjoy toying with them. While I read Graysmith's book on Zodiac, this film does a decent job in recreating historic events in the Zodiac crimes to detail. Maybe I have forgotten some of Graysmith's details but I'll never forget that the Zodiac is still playing games even from beyond the grave.",Zodiac

52,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Zodiac,10,31 May 2007,"Serial killers make good villainous subjects for movies, especially notorious ones who never get caught, like Jack the Ripper, spinning off countless of movie adaptations, each with its own theories on who might be the real perpetrator, and responsible for the creation of a subculture devoted to their study and conspiracy theories as natural by products.While England had her own uncaught cult slasher, America's San Francisco Bay Area had its own serial killer to contend with, someone who calls himself the Zodiac, responsible for taking the lives of plenty in the late 60s. The hallmark of this killer is his terrorist tactics of fear and threats, and the constant taunts and demands made to both the press and the police, belittling and challenging them to come out one step ahead. His killings seem almost random, and employed various weapons from guns to knives, and those cryptic coded messages sent to the press that could have its root keys from anywhere.With a runtime of 158 minutes, you hardly notice the time whittle by as you become transfixed throughout the entire movie. David Fincher helmed this as a tight ship, firmly knowing its destination, while riding out the complexity of it all, spanning almost a timeline of a decade. Based on the books by Robert Graysmith, a cartoonist for the San Francisco Chronicles portrayed by Jake Gyllenhaal, this film doesn't end with a cop out, as it firmly hypothesizes, and supports its theories with whatever evidence it can get its hands on, circumstantial or otherwise. It doesn't flinch from pointing that accusatory finger.I thought it combined many of the best elements found in Fincher's earlier works, from the obvious stylistic feel of Se7en, also itself a serial killer movie, the effects of Fight Club and the mindgames that its characters play, and of course, the general feel of doom and gloom of Panic Room. Light and Shadows become so integral that we take their contribution to heighten senses of tension for granted, and the rain brought back the memories of that classic confrontational scene from Se7en, though here, it cleanses and erases plausible leads, as if to start all over again to untangle from the messy investigations that trailed off over time.Those expecting a lot of action in the recreation of the Zodiac killings might be disappointed, and I thought Fincher had steered clear of the obvious, where lesser directors might have played up on those gruesome murders, or photographs from the actual crime scene. Here, it's more of a presentation on what could have happened based on eyewitness and police reports, and it doesn't glorify. With the real life folks who were involved in the cases onboard as consultants, you know that this is as authentic as it can get.What makes Zodiac engaging is that the movie engages you right from the start, as you take on this investigative journey with the main leads in Robert Graysmith (Gyllenhaal), Paul Avery the Chronicle's senior crime report, played by Robert Downey Jr, and Inspector Dave Toshi of the San Francisco Police Department, portrayed by Mark Ruffalo. We see how the case develops into an obsession for each of these men, as we encounter countless of confusion, red tape, turf protection, dedication to due process, and hindrance. The various departments involved can't work together, and attempts at cooperation are mountains to climb. So it's no wonder that cases like these that span different boundaries, often come up to naught, or take ages to get cracked on.Zodiac is told in two seamless halves, with the first devoted to the killings and methodology of the killer, and the second giving Graysmith more screen time as he goes for a second helping at trying to piece the puzzles together right from the very beginning. After all, that's one way to do it when stuff turn out all over the place, and the trail gets cold. It's classic investigative journalism, and builds to a resounding crescendo, while you too get frustrated at what can, and cannot be done, what can be presented as evidence, and how circumstantial evidence, strong as they may seem, will always remain circumstantial despite it being possibly damning. There are genuine creepy moments that will get to you, even though there's nothing horrific, or ghoulish about those scenes. That's classic Fincher for you, making your hair stand with achieved subtlety.Despite its huge cast list and extras, the key leads all delivered strong performances, bringing the movie onto another level, more so with the film's excellent music from the era, and its art direction and sets recreating the 70s SF. And for film buffs, well, Dirty Harry was after all based on the killings and taunting tactics of Zodiac too.Possibly the best movie to hit our screens this week, surpassing those lacklustre trilogy blockbusters. A definite must watch, so it's well worth that effort to journey to those few screens with warped timings.",Zodiac
53,SimonJack,A serial killer who could have been stopped,8,10 November 2018,"The performances by all of the cast in ""Zodiac"" are very good. One can't know how well they reflect the personas of the real people they portrayed from the book and true story. But, the film gives a sense of reality in the roles of the investigating detectives and police, and of the lead character. Jake Gyllenhall plays the real Robert Graysmith, according to Graysmith's book. He was a normally shy and timid political cartoonist who became obsessed with finding the identify of the serial killer, Zodiac.Mark Ruffalo and Anthony Edwards play inspectors David Toschi and William Armstrong of the San Francisco police. And, Elias Koteas plays Sgt. Jack Mulanax of the Vallejo police.Graysmith wrote the novel about the Zodiac murders of northern California and the search for the killer who called himself Zodiac. The story takes place from 1969 into the 1990s. And the mystery has not yet been officially solved.I haven't read Graysmith's book of the same title. But I can recall the headlines and gist of the Zodiac killings from the news of that time. The movie does a good job of showing the intensity of the main people involved in trying to crack the case. It also shows an initial lack of cooperation among local police departments. No doubt, the Zodiac killings were a wake-up for law enforcement entities to eagerly cooperate to solve crimes in the future.In spite of the earnest efforts of the principal investigators, the movie (if not the book also) shows some weaknesses and mistakes that probably kept the law from solving the crimes. One weakness was in the heavy reliance at the time on handwriting analysis. The conclusion by the handwriting expert, Melvin Belli (played by Brian Cox) was taken flatly as proof that various suspects were not Zodiac. That included the most likely suspect, Arthur Leigh Allen. Although still used today, handwriting is highly disputed. If some people can fool a lie detector test, some surely could alter or modify their handwriting sufficiently to fool the analysts.The movie shows two glaring mistakes or oversights. When Toschi and Armstrong interviewed Arthur Leigh Allen at his work, they were highly suspicious of him. Why didn't they get an immediate search warrant for his residence? We learned later that in less than 48 hours, Allen moved a lot of stuff out of his residence. So, when the police finally did search the place, they found nothing incriminating. But the biggest error was in not pursuing Michael Mageau after he moved away. He survived the July 4, 1969 shooting that began the Zodiac's spree. And, he was the one and only person who saw the killer's face and could identify him.Indeed, the scene at the very end shows Mageau picking Arthur Allen's photo out of several shown him. Officer George Bawart had replaced the retired Jack Mulanax in the Vallejo police department. He met with Mageau in 1991, and Mageau was quick to identify Arthur Allen as the person who shot him 22 years earlier. Had the police tracked down Mageau in 1969 or 1970, they would have had Zodiac convicted on the basis of an eyewitness survivor, supported by much circumstantial evidence.Instead, the movie shows what happened 22 years after the start of Zodiac's killing spree. Before the police could charge Allen with the murders, after Mageau's 1991 ID of him, Allen died of a heart attack. So, that one big mistake by the police in 1969-70, led to years and years of searching, checking, and working by several people - all without a solution. The movie never explains why the police did not try to go after Mageau to have him look at photos of suspects.",Zodiac
54,christopher-underwood,"Thorough, authorative and workmanlike rather than stunning.",8,12 March 2021,"A fine summation of the Zodiac killer case that spans so many years. For a film of this length everything seems to scamper on with regular textural on screen updates as to when and where we are. interaction between the characters is good and we feel, perhaps as with All The Presidents Men, that we are in on the detective work ourselves. I was surprised that the killings depicted all seem to be at the start and I do feel that it should have been relatively simple to reduce the running time to something a little more acceptable. A length approaching three hours seems rather excessive and there was considerable repletion of meetings visits etc. My other gripe is the lack of style evident. I'm sure Fincher wanted this to be a respectful and serious portrayal of the saga and this must have been why he veered away from imposing any too striking a visual look. The amazing night time diner and hoardings with massed cars at the very start had me gasping but this is barely repeated in similar fashion more than a couple of times.

'Zodiac' Synopsis: A San Francisco cartoonist becomes an amateur detective obsessed with tracking down the Zodiac killer.'Zodiac' is engrossing, intense & disturbing.

He has handled each & every moment with dexterity. Cinematography is claustrophobic, while the Editing is mostly crisp. Art & Costume Design are mention-worthy.Performance-Wise: Jake Gyllenhaal as Robert Graysmith, delivers a paranoid, eerie performance. He's exceptional. Mark Ruffalo as SFPD Inspector David Toschi, is scene-stealing good. Robert Downey, Jr. as Paul Avery, is excellent, as ever. Anthony Edwards as SFPD Inspector William Armstrong, is remarkable. Chloë Sevigny as Melanie Graysmith, is very sincere. Brian Cox as Melvin Belli, is electrifying. John Carroll Lynch as Arthur Leigh Allen, is first-rate. On the whole, 'Zodiac' is Terrific!",Zodiac
56,JamesHitchcock,No Presumption of Innocence in Hollywood,5,25 June 2007,"""Zodiac"" deals with a series of unsolved murders which took place in the San Francisco area in the 1960s and early 1970s. (These killings were also the inspiration for the film ""Dirty Harry"", although in that film the murders committed by the fictional ""Scorpio"" were of course solved). It has never been established whether these murders were the work of one killer or several. It is generally believed that five murders and two attempted murders in 1968 and 1969 were all committed by the same person, who may or may not also have been responsible for several other crimes. A notable feature of the case was that the killer, or someone claiming to be the killer, wrote a series of taunting letters to the police and press, something which happens far less frequently in real life than it does in fiction. Although the film follows the police investigation into the crimes, and two detectives are featured, the main character is not a policeman but a journalist with the San Francisco Chronicle. Robert Graysmith (a real individual) was not, moreover, a crime reporter. He was the paper's cartoonist who gradually became obsessed with the case and continued researching into it in his spare time. One of the film's themes is the way in which the case took over the lives of those involved, not only Graysmith but also the two detectives, David Toschi and William Armstrong, and another reporter Paul Avery. (The name ""Graysmith"" is used throughout the film, even though at the time of the killings he was known as Robert Gray Smith and did not change his name to Graysmith until 1976). There is a problem with making films about real-life unsolved murders. For obvious reasons, they cannot be brought within any of the established categories of the crime drama- the ""whodunit?"", which concentrates on the police and the way in which they solve the crime, the ""whydunit?"", which concentrates on the criminal and the psychological and social factors which drove him to commit it, or the courtroom drama (or the ""didhedunit?"") which concentrates on the lawyers and proceedings in court. Each of these categories has a well-defined dramatic focus- the solution of the crime, the explanation of the criminal's motives, the jury's verdict- which must be lacking in any film about an unsolved crime.One way of overcoming this problem is to provide a sensational fictional solution to a real-life crime. Films about the Jack the Ripper case, the most famous unsolved serial killings in history, often centre upon the preposterous theory, which has no basis in historical fact, that the murders were committed by, or on behalf of, Queen Victoria's grandson the Duke of Clarence. (""Murder by Decree"" and ""From Hell"" are examples). This film takes a somewhat similar view of the Zodiac killings, although at least it does not go so far as to blame them on the British Royal Family. Instead, it takes the view that they were the work of one Arthur Leigh Allen, a real individual who died in 1992. He was investigated by the police as a suspect at the time of the killings, but no charges were ever brought against him. Although there was circumstantial evidence against him, no physical evidence was ever found to link him to the crimes, and neither his handwriting nor his fingerprints matched those on the purported Zodiac letters. Graysmith, however, became convinced that Allen was the murderer, and published a book setting out his thesis. It is this book on which the film is based. Like a number of David Fincher's other films, such as ""Fight Club"", ""Panic Room"" and ""Se7en"", ""Zodiac"" is both metaphorically and literally ""dark"", something which seems to be a trademark with this director. It is metaphorically dark in that it deals with the evil underside of human nature, and literally so in that much of the action takes place either at night or in darkened rooms. The predominant tones are blacks, browns, greys and dull yellows. Fincher is skilled at creating atmosphere, but to make a thriller work atmosphere in itself is not enough. Unlike, say, ""Panic Room"" there is no real sense of tension in Zodiac, a film which moves at a slow pace and, at over two and a half hours, is seriously overlong. I also found distasteful the attempt to brand a dead man the killer, even though he never stood trial for these offences. (Hollywood is the one part of America where there is no presumption of innocence until proved guilty). I am surprised this film has made your top 250. In my view it is just a rather dull police procedural about how the police spent many years in failing to solve a crime- even with the aid of a cartoonist. 5/10",Zodiac
57,Smells_Like_Cheese,A great thriller about the true story of the brutal Zodiac Killer,8,24 July 2007,"Just a few days ago, my mom and I watched a documentary on the famous Zodiac killer and his victims. It was incredibly interesting so it got me thinking about the film Zodiac that was released this year and lucky enough it was released on DVD today so I rented it. My friend and I just watched it a couple of hours ago and really liked it, especially on how it ended and was over all shot. I thought it was kinda cool how it started off like a documentary type of movie, but then was turning into a thriller that kept you going and guessing, even if you knew the whole story.In the small towns of California, there are several brutal murders, eventually going onto San Fransisco. These murders are extremely violent and very random, and every time it happens there is a message or sign that is left by the killer that calls himself the ""Zodiac"". He sends letters to the press on how and where he killed his victims and teases the police that they will never catch him. But Robert, one of the newspaper cartoonist starts to obsess about the killer, who he is and how they can capture him.With an all star cast, we had absolutely no problem with acting because it was terrific. Jake and Mark held their own very well. The whole story is very chilling and kept you going. The Zodiac Killer is a case that forever will remain a mystery and it was a great idea for a film, Fincher added a Se7en type of feel to this film. It's so funny how I knew the story and how it ended already, but I was actually just waiting to see what would happen in the next scene. I would highly recommend this film to any thriller fan, I'm sure you'll enjoy it, it's a great one for 2007.8/10",Zodiac
58,disdressed12,"the movie itself is pretty decent,but the disc is bare bones(2 disc special edition comes out in '08)",7,3 August 2007,"i didn't find too many problems with this movie.i mean,it is 157 minutes,but that doesn't really have a negative effect on the film.the acting is good all around,but no standout performances.the story is well written,and easy to follow.by the way,if you're not familiar with the story,Zodiac is a killer who terrorized the San Francisco Bay area in the late 60's early 70's.the case was never officially solved.a lot of the movie consists of quiet,dramatic moments,with a bit of subdued action here and there.the movie is compelling enough to maintain interest,but not outstanding.i did think,however,that the tone of the film was a bit too light for the subject matter.otherwise,though,it's pretty good.the DVD is bare bones,but there is a preview of a special 2 disc edition coming in 2008,which promises insights into the case with in depth interviews from those involved in the original case and much more.i actually think this stuff will be more compelling than the movie.my advice,rent the bare bones edition and wait for the special edition.",Zodiac
59,KineticSeoul,Intriguing and suspenseful,9,19 January 2016,"Fincher is one of those director's that seem to enjoy doing mystery murder movies and he does his job very well. Although this film is over 2 hours long, the way Fincher directed this and the material really intrigued me. And got me really interested in figuring out who the Zodiac killer really is. It's kind of sad to give a serial killer so much attention when the victims just dissipate. However this is a mystery film that revolve around a serial killer that called himself the Zodiac and the outcome of what can happen when a serial killer gets too much publicity and attention from the public. How sometimes certain crime can be a publicity stunt that can lead to others joining in. How assumptions can arise from dumb intuition to paranoia. Sure a lot of it has to do with the Zodiac, but it's mostly about the outcome and it's effect on people. Fincher really did put in a lot of detail in this film to the point, the investigation and interrogation process was interesting and their was suspense and tension during certain scenes to the point it has the capability to make the viewers paranoid. Most of the focus is on Robert Graysmith who is actually the author of the book this film is based on. Graysmith is a newspaper cartoonist who gets way too obsessed with the Zodiac killer. Like the Zodiac is a killer with grand plans, a methodical killer that is scheming something way more then he is showing, that there is some sort of in depth pattern to it all. The secondary character is The inspector, David Toschi who puts in a lot of effort into cracking the case and finding the killer. Overall this isn't a movie that is focused on the graphic killing spree although there is few. It's more about the attention to detail that really grabs the attention and interest which develops into suspense. Overall this is a very underrated Fincher film that I would highly recommend.9/10",Zodiac
60,sddavis63,A Well Done Account Of The Search For A Serial Killer,8,25 January 2008,"What we have here is a story based on the facts of the Zodiac murders in California in the late 60's/early 70's. Knowing that this was the background of it (although I wasn't actually familiar with the story of this particular serial killer) I found that this movie was a surprise in many ways. My first expectation was that it was going to be more explicitly about the Zodiac killings. In fact the killings themselves weren't really the centre of the story. Some of them were depicted, and there was some blood involved, but David Fincher, who directed this, avoided the temptation to make this a slasher-type thriller. This may sound strange, but the depictions of the murders - to the extent that they were depicted - I thought were rather tastefully done and avoided excessive gore. The movie then seemed to focus around the investigation into the killings, but even that turned out not to be the real point of the movie. Really, it became a movie about the obsession of various people to figure out who the killer was, and how it took over their lives.Jake Gyllenhaal was brilliant as Robert Graysmith, a cartoonist for the San Fransisco Chronicle who starts up a friendship with reporter Paul Avery (a nice performance from Robert Downey, Jr.) who is the lead reporter on the killings.Avery's obsession with the case leads to a series of problems which eventually leave him out of a job, while Graysmith becomes even more obsessed, sacrificing his job and his family to eventually write a book about the killings. On the police side of things, Mark Ruffalo as Inspector David Toschi also finds his life being taken over by this investigation, while the only one in the movie who eventually escapes from this and moves on with his life is Inspector Bill Armstrong (Anthony Edwards).As the movie progresses from killer thriller to crime drama to a study of obsession, I found myself becoming increasingly drawn into it. There's more than enough hints at the possibility of various rather creepy people who may have committed the murders, and in the end it all points to one suspect in particular, but the murders remain officially unsolved, and the prime suspect is now dead.I thought the movie might have been a little bit shorter than it was ( it clocks in at 2:37) but aside from that this is a very well done story that keeps you thinking and keeps you guessing. 8/10",Zodiac
61,Buddy-51,a thinking-man's thriller,8,12 March 2007,"With ""Zodiac,"" director David Fincher returns to the crime thriller territory he explored to such effectiveness in ""Seven"" a dozen odd years ago.For over a decade - from December 1968 to the late 1970's - a serial killer calling himself The Zodiac terrorized the San Francisco Bay Area, dispatching his victims seemingly at random while keeping up a cryptic, cat-and-mouse correspondence with several major newspapers in the area. Despite some impressive leads, the killer was never caught and the murders eventually stopped as quickly and mysteriously as they had started.At 160 minutes, ""Zodiac"" lacks the streamlining and telescoping we've come to expect from movies about serial killers, which are more often designed for sensationalism and exploitation than contemplation and reflection. Taking a novelistic approach to the subject, screenwriter James Vanderbilt gives the drama room to breathe, allowing detail to pile upon detail, and providing an array of characters who disappear from the drama for long periods of time only to return to center stage when called upon to do so by the facts of the case.The drawback in such a strategy is that the movie occasionally feels aimless and formless, as it ricochets back and forth between plot strands and characters that often seem at cross purposes to one another. But the distinct advantage of this approach is that the movie feels less contrived and artificial and more akin to real life, as it captures the sometimes decidedly unglamorous nature and frustratingly plodding pace of actual crime detection. And for those who might be hesitant to watch the film due strictly to its subject matter, it should be noted that, for a movie on such a grisly topic, ""Zodiac"" is surprisingly tame in the blood-and-guts department (thank goodness).Indeed, the movie gets its unnerving murder scenes out of the way right up front, so it can turn its full attention to its real areas of interest: chronicling the behind-the-scenes search for the killer and exploring the psychological impact this search has on three men who become, to varying degrees, obsessed with the case. Jake Gyllenhaal, who hit a career high water mark in 2005 with ""Proof,"" ""Jarhead"" and, of course, ""Brokeback Mountain,"" continues his journey into edgy roles playing Graysmith, the rather nerdy cartoonist for the San Francisco Chronicle, who managed to get closer to unveiling the true identity of the killer than anyone else, and who went on to write of his experiences in the book, ""Zodiac Unmasked: The Identity of America's Most Elusive Serial Killer Revealed,"" on which the film itself is based. Graysmith was able to scoop even the lead investigator, David Toschi (sharply played by the always interesting Mark Ruffalo), who finds his life becoming ever more overtaken by the case the longer it drags on without resolution. The third major actor in the drama is Paul Avery, the crime beat reporter who turned to drink, thereby torpedoing his own career, after the killer singled him out as a potential target. It is the lack of screen time allotted to Avery that offers one of the genuine disappointments of the movie, especially as he is embodied by the brilliant Robert Downey Jr., whose own life experiences make him the perfect choice for the role.With its meticulously mounted, pitch-perfect recreation of the details of the case as well as the times in which they took place, ""Zodiac"" is one of the few films of recent years that can truly be termed a thinking man's thriller.",Zodiac
62,cherold,Engrossing but overlong,7,10 March 2014,"Zodiac is often compelling, with solid performances, a good sense of place, some really disturbing and suspenseful moments and a great soundtrack. It is also much too long, as though made by someone so enamored with its story that they couldn't bear to cut a single moment from it.While this movie recreates in distressing detail the killings of the serial killer known as The Zodiac, for the most part it is an investigative movie along the lines of All the President's Men, one fascinated by evidence and research. The difference is this movie is also heavily focused on obsession.The acting is good, particularly Jake Gyllenhaal as a jittery cartoonist who becomes obsessed with the case. The investigation itself is involving, although at times it can be hard to keep up with the steady stream of clues that lead investigators running around.Still, it's too long, and it doesn't feel like it's a movie that *needs* to be this long to tell the story. In fact, while I really liked Robert Downey Jr.'s performance, his character wasn't especially necessary to the story being told; he should have been a fairly minor character. That could have cut a half hour off the running time without losing anything essential to the story.Even though it's too long, though, it's worth seeing.",Zodiac
63,bensonmum2,"""Before I kill you, I'm going to throw your baby out the window.""",8,7 September 2007,"Almost 40 years ago, the San Francisco area was terrorized by a crazed killer known only as Zodiac. He committed what seems to have been a series of cold-blooded, but random murders. He would follow-up the killings with letters sent to the police and newspapers that taunted them with clues and cryptograms that promised to reveal his identity. He claims to have killed a dozen or so people. But after years of activity, the Zodiac disappeared. Though some feel they know Zodiac's true identity, the case has never been officially solved. David Fincher's movie Zodiac is the story of this famous but dark period of American history and presents on possible solution to the mystery of the Zodiac.Having recently done some reading on the Zodiac killer, I decided it was high time I checked out Fincher's movie. I was well aware of some of Fincher's other work but I hadn't read much about Zodiac, so I wasn't sure exactly what to expect. Also, given the quality of some of the other movies made about real life serial killers, I tried not to get my hopes up too high. Overall, I'm very impressed. Zodiac is an intelligent, thrilling, well-written piece of cinema with some very good performances. If you're looking for a thrill-a-minute ride, you'll be disappointed. While some of the Zodiac's murders are shown in detail, they are not the focus of the movie. Instead, the investigation by the police and the reporters is central to Zodiac's plot. In a comment on IMDb, I read the comparison between Zodiac and All the President's Men and couldn't agree more. The obsession of Woodward and Bernstein to get to the bottom of Watergate is very similar to that of Robert Graysmith as he hunts for the elusive killer. Some may call it slow or even dull, but having an attention span longer than 30 seconds, I found it very exciting.While I've done a little research on the Zodiac case, I'm far from an expert. But from what little I do know, I appreciate how well the movie sticks with the facts of the case. I'm sure those more well versed in the subject would be more qualified to respond to this, but I noted very few instances of creative liberties being taken with the material. And most of those instances seem to come from Graysmith's novel and were not made by those responsible for the movie. And I'm impressed with the way Fincher was able to take these known facts and create such an entertaining movie. Even though I knew the outcome and what was going to happen next, Fincher puts so much style and atmosphere into the movie that it's predictability with me hardly mattered. I was literally on the edge of my seat. It's a well directed movie.Finally, I cannot end this without singling out some the acting as a real bright spot of Zodiac. Jake Gyllenhaal, Robert Downey, Jr., Anthony Edwards, and everyone else involved did a wonderful job. In fact, I cannot think of a single actor that I didn't enjoy. But as good as every performer was, I was most impressed with Mark Ruffalo as Inspector David Toschi. I bought his character completely. It's quite simply a brilliant performance.",Zodiac
64,sol-kay,Luna-tic fringe,7,20 August 2008,"****SPOILER ALERT**** The movie ""Zodiac"" chronicles some 40 years of the statewide hunt for the notorious Zodiac Killer. The man who terrorized the San Francisco Bay area in the late 1960's up until his last ""chiper"" or coded letter back in 1978 and even beyond that.Having become the 20th century US equivalent of 19th century's England Jack the Ripper the Zodiac killer, who may be dead by now, may very well go down in criminal history as one of the most prolific and unidentified killers of all time.The movie ""Zodiac"" tries very hard to stick to the facts which makes it very hard to follow at times. Since the facts, unlike a number of fictitious movies about the same subject, are as confusing as the mysterious killer himself. About a month after gunning down at a local Vallejo Calif lovers lane Darlene Ferrin, who died, and Mike Mageau, who survived, the San Francisco Chronicle, or Examiner in real life, received this cryptic letter by the person who claimed responsibility for the shootings.The paper's ace reporter Paul Avery was put on the case but the pressure of tracking down and identifying the killer was just too much for him. Avery later ended up becoming one of the people on the Zodiac's hit list in a Halloween card that the killer sent him. This has Avery go off the deep end and end up a helpless alcoholic quiting his job and living on a boat where he eventually drank himself to death.It was the combination of the Chronicle's political cartoonist Robert Graysmith and SFPD inspector David Toschi who ended up picking up the ball that Avery dropped and ran with it in trying to find the killer. That had Insp. Toschi almost drummed out of the department in being accused, unjustifiably, of faking one of the Zodiac's letters! This, SFDP's internal affairs suspected, was in order for Insp. Toschi to get his superiors on the police force to give him more manpower and money to do his job.As for Graysmith he did uncover a number of clues about the Zodiac's identity, that he later had published in his best selling book, but they all for the most part lead to a dead end ! With the suspected killer, after being completely cleared by the San Francisco Police, dying some ten years later at age 58 of a heart attack. That was after, as seen in the movie, he was positivity identified by one of his surviving victims Mike Mageau in early 1991! You wonder why it took the SFPD all this time, some 22 years after he was gunned down, to get Megeau to identify by pointing the so-called killer, after he was exonerated, out in a grainy mugshot! When he could have done it by facing him in person, or in a lineup, while he was still alive and a prime suspect in the Zodiac killings!The Zodiac went on to murder at least two more people and seriously wounding a third, in a murderous knife attack,in the movie until he just faded out of sight! With only his occasionally cryptic letters sent to local newspapers keeping him on the front pages. It's been speculated that the Zodiac killer had murdered some 30 to 50 people since his admitted rampage against society began back in 1963; Six years before the Ferrin/Mageau shooting on July 4, 1969. But the Zodiac is only credited in the movie, and by the SFPD, of only 5 killings that's one less then those of the his New York City rival, in serial murder, The Son of Sam! This must have really hurt his already, with all the free publicity he was getting, very inflated ego as him being one of the greatest, together with the likes of John Gacy & Theodore Bundy, serial killers of all time!You really couldn't expect that much from the movie ""Zodiac"" since it's universally known that the Zodiac Killer has never been as much as identified or, if he's in fact already dead, caught and made to face justice for his crimes. The film in its over two and one half hours running time did educate its audience in how difficult it is, even with the most up to date and state of the art crime fighting science, to capture an intelligent and murderous psycho when he, despite his enormous ego, doesn't slip up and, like in most cases, lead the police straight to his front door!",Zodiac

66,Robert_duder,"All the facts are laid out, a straight forward and such a little slow moving account of an infamous crime spree",7,6 March 2007,"Zodiac has some great pluses on it's side. As a pseudo-documentary the facts are laid out in plain terms, the storyline and time line are kept in tact and it would feel like nothing is added for dramatic element or to make the film more crowd pleasing and that is definitely okay!! For main stream audiences heading into Zodiac with the thought of this being some sort of action film or even a thriller might find themselves disappointed because this is a very real account of the horrific murders by the still at large Zodiac killer in Sanfrancisco, chronicling from his start in the late 60's right through to almost modern day but mostly ending in the early eighties and how the crimes effected three people in particular some to this day. The cast is well done but ultimately a film like this isn't about the cast and really doesn't give them anything to sink their teeth in because the film is about the killer...Zodiac...hence the name. One of the most beautiful things about the film is it doesn't leave the ending open like I thought it would but rather actually gives an opinion or possible and most likely suspect and how they track him. I mean of course because they are stating their opinion it's going to show the facts weighing in the direction of their suspect and I do encourage anyone after seeing this film to look at other books to see the weight of evidence against their suspect but none the less it made the film much easier to watch knowing there was going to be an outcome.Jake Gyllenhaal gets the most of the story by portraying cartoonist and eventual Zodiac obsessive researcher Robert Graysmith, the writer whose book the film is based on. My only thought about Gyllenhall is that he looked very young in the sixties and he looked very young in the eighties, they made little attempt if any to make him look older. However his gradual fall into obsession is well documented and intriguing to watch and when he really gets into investigating the case it really does move the film along and his discoveries are downright fascinating. Mark Ruffalo, who I often find a little bland, is actually not bad as Inspector David Toschi who is put in charge of the case. Toschi shows a softer side of obsession, hiding it better, but you can see his intense desire to uncover the truth and you see it more when he unwillingly helps Graysmith. Ruffalo and Gyllenhaal have good chemistry playing off each other and I still think Ruffalo is a little too laid back but he does an okay job. Robert Downey Jr. plays himself...well close anyways...he actually plays crime reporter for the Chronicle Paul Avery who eventually goes on a downward spiral of drugs and alcohol. I don't know if they intend his substance abuse to be a result of the investigation but I never got that. In fact for the most part I got the impression Avery didn't really care all that much about Zodiac but just getting drunk and high and making money. Downey Jr. just seemed like he was having a good time and I didn't think his performance or his role added much to the film. Chloë Sevigny is just kind of there for her role as Gyllenhaal's wife. She never shows all that much emotion or adds anything to the story. Anthony Edwards is decent enough in a small role as Ruffalo's partner Inspector William Armstrong. Cleverly the Zodiac during his murder scenes are actually portrayed by three different actors. This makes everything more interesting because they never look the same and it implies the difference in witness descriptions and that he always claimed he didn't look the same when committing his murders. John Carroll Lynch is quite good in his small role as their number one suspect Arthur Leigh Allen. He fits the profile and is believable as the killer but at the same time believable he might not be.I might say that part of the problem with Zodiac is the cast but I don't know if it is. I don't think casting anyone else in any other roles would have made any difference because the plot and story is just very analytical. It isn't really about the characters. David Fincher is no amateur to directing. In fact he was the genius behind one of the greatest crime films of all time ""Se7en"" and also directed the classic action film ""Alien."" But he left behind that element of science fiction or dark, gritty, fiction and went head over heels straight forward crime documentary and there is nothing wrong with that and I think it will come to be appreciated in the future. The thing was the film felt like it belonged on Television. There was nothing about it that made it Hollywood worth while. It could have aired on The History Channel, or America's Most Wanted as re-enactment or even been a great TV Series but for a movie it kinda misses the mark somewhere. Still worth seeing especially for fans of real crime or history buffs and despite it's huge running time most of it goes by quickly and keeps you interested. 7/10",Zodiac
67,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,Lengthy but worthwhile serial killer yarn from David Fincher,9,21 November 2007,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning The 'Zodiac killer' began his reign of terror in the San Francisco area in the late 1960s, killing young couples in isolated areas. He would continue his sick little game for another two decades and several detectives, including Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal), David Toschi (Mark Ruffalo) and Paul Avery (Robert Downey Jr.) would be driven round the bend in their desperate hunt for him.Despite the rave reviews, Zodiac was a film I still managed to miss when it showed in theatres. Maybe it had something to do with Se7en never being one of my favourite flicks, but more likely it was the length. I'm one of these people who loves the cinema but suffers from horrible bum-ache if I'm required to sit down in a cinema seat for too long.Towards the end of the film, it has started to drag on a little and the plot has begun to get a bit wavey and meandering, but generally Fincher has crafted a gripping tale that won me over more than Se7en. Whereas that film was relentlessly bleak and moody, here that tone is mixed with scenes with a bit more humour and light, as well as a funky, cool 70s soundtrack. Two scenes do stand out as especially unsettling, namely a scene where a couple are tied up and stabbed to death by a lake and a killing in a taxi cab where the camera slowly backs away as 'Ring a Ring of Roses' creepily plays over it.There would need to be some good performances to keep the boat floating, of course, and the cast all deliver, with Gyllenhaal showing his developing maturity as a serious actor in the lead role, along with good support from Ruffalo and a straight and sober Downey Jr., making his role all his own as the eccentric older detective.Too many people would disagree with me for it to have effect but personally I'd say Fincher has shown a better knack for real serial killer stories than made up ones. ****",Zodiac
68,Lejink,Overlong and winding road,6,19 August 2007,"Not sure what to make of this dog's breakfast of a movie. Part police procedural, part historical recreation, part murder mystery, part serial - killer docudrama, I think it falls between too many stools and loses its way through its way overlong playing time until the downbeat climax(if that's not too oxymoronic) when the Jake Gyllenhaal character gets to look the main Zodiac killer suspect in the eye. Bits of it I liked, the ensemble acting (the cops beat the reporters hands down), the musical soundtrack and the newsroom recreation straight out of ""Lou Grant"" but I kept looking at my watch in anguish each time Gyllenhall's character reaches yet another dead-end in his obsessive journey to the truth. Strange to criticise the director of ""Seven"" for a lack of suspense at key points (the murders and the confrontation between Gyllenhaal and Zodiac's creepy former - employer just before the end, just don't engage} but I was never brought to the edge of my seat. Still, I just about survived until the end but feel the movie could have benefited from a bit less meaningless characterisation and more tightly focused editing to deliver a more satisfying movie experience.",Zodiac
69,paul2001sw-1,Police reconstruction,7,14 April 2013,"'Zodiac' is David Fincher's film about a long-running police investigation into an uncaught serial killer. The film's central character is a newspaper cartoonist who (in real life, as in the movie) became obsessed with the case; but the film follows the full, convoluted investigative procedure. Fincher is certainly a skilled director, although sometimes the film appears to be presenting (in its background music and stories) a sketch-by-numbers account of recent history. More problematic is its lack of focus: most characters are only briefly in the spotlight, and the lack of both resolution (and continuing murders) eventually diffuses interest: another year, another clue, but the (instinctively realistic, and in fact accurate) lack of resolution reminds one why thrillers tend to go for implausible melodramatic conclusions. This isn't quite a detective film, a killer-thriller, or even a straightforward movie about obsession: credit should be given to Fincher for not staying within the straight-jacket of a single narrow convention, but at times, it feels more like police reconstruction than drama.",Zodiac

By the end of the first 30 minutes I was lost in the many details of the Zodiac serial killer case, and 30 minutes later I was on the verge of falling asleep, after all this is the maximum duration I can hold on similar themed TV series, and then I usually go to bed.It is not that it is not a well made film. I was amazed to read comments from viewers and critics about David Fincher having made a 'regular' movie. Maybe the subject seems to be so, but the cinema work is sophisticated - as we advance from the late 60s to the 80s the digital camera reconstitutes the light, the clarity, and the palette of colors of the films of that time. So subtle that it neighbors geniality.Yet the detective story is the weak part of the movie. Trying to be true to facts, it does not create enough tension, details accumulate and blur one another, and taking into account that most of the viewers know the story they are simply not enough interesting for more than half of the movie.An then something happens. You realize that the movie is no longer about the crime or the criminal, we know all that is worth knowing about those, but about the men trying to find the truth and about the obsession that brings them on the verge of the destruction of their families or even self destruction. Acting certainly helps, with Jake Gyllenhaal, Mark Ruffalo and Robert Downey Jr. each giving such a top performance that the next year Acadmy nominating committee will have a hard time choosing whom to bring to the big evening in L.A. Seeing Jake Gyllenhaal for example I had a flashback three decades back with Richard Dreyfuss building mountains in his living room to prepare the close encounter. One can say that this film is much too long, so long that it ends by being interesting.",Zodiac
71,MLDinTN,too long for me,5,14 August 2008,"This is one of several movies that have been made about the famous Zodiac killer. There's not a lot of action, mainly a character study. The movie focuses on 3 guys searching for clues about the Zodiac. One is a detective, one is an editorialist at the paper, and the other is a cartoonist at the paper, Robert Graysmith. The story centers around Graysmith as he seems to be obsessed more than any one and spends lots of time trying to decipher the Zodiac's codes. They come up with a prime suspect but are never able to get enough evidence to bring charges. The movie is based on a book Graysmith wrote.FINAL VERDICT: If you've seen another movie about the Zodiac, then you know what happens. This is nothing new. But, it is too long.",Zodiac
72,gbill-74877,Solid dramatization,8,16 March 2020,"A pretty compelling account of the Zodiac killer and ensuing investigation over decades. It's long, almost too long, but it matches just how drawn out the case was, and allows for all sorts of little details, the fleshing out of the people involved, and the eeriness of never really knowing to unfold. The names and places sometimes fly fast and furious, but the story is well told in many ways, starting with what the frustration does to the monomaniacal police and reporters looking into it. Mostly it feels like a mental thriller, but damn, that basement scene is truly scary. The circumstantial case against Arthur Leigh Allen is well laid out, and to me it was pretty surprising that he eluded more aggressive investigation and arrest, e.g. the amount of time between the testimony of Donald Cheney and the first search warrant, but of course, that's with the benefit of hindsight. Jake Gyllenhaal, Mark Ruffalo, Robert Downey Jr., and Anthony Edwards all do well here, and this a very solid dramatization.",Zodiac
73,g-bodyl,Crafty Thriller!,8,5 June 2013,"Zodiac is a well-made thriller that does what it's supposed to do: thrill people. What makes this David Fincher film a bit special compared to other thrillers is that it relies upon talk and emotions of the characters rather than action or gore. In that respect, this film reminds me of the baseball film, Moneyball which relied upon talk rather than action. Some people might find this boring, but it's well-acted and the crafty direction by Fincher makes this dark thriller work.This film is based off the true story of how a cartoon drawer becomes obsessed with a series of murders by the ""zodiac"" killer in California and how he tries to solve the case despite not receiving any credible help from anyone.As with most Fincher movies, this film is well-acted. Jake Gyllenhaal really absorbed me in as he tries to solve this case. He is an underrated actor. Mark Ruffalo who happens to be a great actor gives a great performance. Robert Downey Jr plays himself but can we really complain? Overall, this is a gripping, absorbing tale about the gruesome murders that took place over a span of many years with only letters giving hints about the murders. Fincher does a great job toying with our beliefs. I noticed as soon as I set one character as a suspect, a new one would appear. I like when thrillers play with our minds. This film is a little long and perhaps somewhat slow but it is dark and has some Fincher-like twists. I rate this film 8/10.",Zodiac

It tries to condense over 30 years of history with no definite ending into one cohesive movie. And, for the most part, it succeeds.

77,atlasmb,A Dramatization of the Zodiac Killer Case,7,27 April 2015,"""Zodiac"" is a fact-based film starring Jake Gyllenhaal as Robert Graysmith, a cartoonist for a San Francisco newspaper during the Zodiac killings of the seventies. The story is about Graysmith's obsession over many years with the unsolved case.Also central to the story are Robert Downey, Jr. as Paul Avery, a colleague who handles the crime beat while fighting his own destructive personality, and Mark Ruffalo as David Toschi, an inspector for the SFPD who tries to solve the case.This is a lengthy film, but it serves to match the protracted time that Graysmith dedicates to his investigation. The film is an interesting, chronological telling of the story, including the somewhat chimerical crime spree and the city-wide panic it inspired. The acting is good, and the main reason this film is enjoyable.",Zodiac
78,tabuno,Commendable Effort,7,21 January 2019,"5 March 2007. This lengthy crime mystery murder movie in a way reflects a more realistic scenario that crime investigations actually take, but unfortunately the expected dramatic path is strewn with such a slow pace unlike classic ""All The President's Men"" (1976) released only two years after Watergate occurred (of which that movie was about). The acting while revealing, particularly that of Jake Gyllenhaal, his character didn't translate into a substantive understanding about himself - his portrayal was more superficial than substantive, raised more questions than answers. Robert Downey Jr. and his performance was entertaining and more interesting wasn't a far stretch nor unique as a personality than his other on-screen personas. Perhaps the most memorable role was that played by Mark Ruffallo, as a dogged detective who must face the realism of his pursuit of this case in the end. Overall, this long movie itself represents the more gritty and routine side of crime, but without the needed cinematic magic that the best movies can offer. Seven out of Ten Stars.",Zodiac

The film moves in fits and starts as the detectives investigating the crime pursue one fruitless lead after another. Although fascinating initially, this approach becomes somewhat tiresome after a while, especially considering the running time of nearly three hours. This one could have benefited from tighter editing. There are good performances from Ruffalo and Edwards as detectives, Downey as an alcoholic reporter, and Gyllenhaal as the cartoonist, whose book is the basis for the rambling screenplay.",Zodiac

The cast, soundtrack, puzzles, editing, acting, and cinematography is all great! Also John Carroll Lynch is one of my favorite actors, cool how much I have seen with him in it lately and overall.",Zodiac
81,briancham1994,Ominous and gripping,8,4 June 2020,"This film reminded me of a less grimy Se7en (1995). David Fincher did another great job directing this dark and ominous thriller. Unlike Se7en, however, this film has a historical element that makes it more grounded. He works around the fact that the Zodiac Killer's identity was never actually established (Ted Cruz jokes notwithstanding). The cinematography, acting and suspense in this film were the best parts.",Zodiac
82,tomgillespie2002,Creates a sense of terror throughout,9,27 March 2014,"You would be forgiven if you went into David Fincher's Zodiac expecting a routine serial killer flick, as, although it opens with two memorably brutal murders, it puts aside character and plot to simply document the case of the Zodiac killer in the late 1960's and into the early 70's. The problem is, he was never caught, so Zodiac draws you into the jigsaw puzzle that was the search for the killer, only to be frequently met with dead ends and red herrings. The three lead characters come and go throughout the film, but this is not about them, it's ultimately about the fear that gripped San Francisco when the Zodiac was on the prowl.At the San Francisco Chronicle, a letter arrives from someone claiming to be the Zodiac killer, who has already shot a young couple in their car. The letter demands publication, and offers a puzzle involving strange symbols as a means of uncovering his identity. This draws in Chronicle cartoonist Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal), who, despite his interest, is not taken seriously by the staff, who include crime reporter Paul Avery (Robert Downey Jr.). The Zodiac strikes again, attacking a couple in a park and shooting a taxi driver in the back of the head. Police detectives David Toschi (Mark Ruffalo) and William Armstrong (Anthony Edwards) are brought in to investigate, and liaise with Avery and Graysmith, whose lives start to be consumed by the case.Fincher is obviously comfortable in this setting, having already brought to life the eternally drizzly and grim world of Se7en (1995) and the miserable confines of modern corporate life in Fight Club (1999). Zodiac is a mixture of both, here filmed digitally, and here combines a grimy brown colour palette with Fincher's recognisable eye for the stylish. It takes pride in its detail, grinding out excitement within the most mundane of activities. In Zodiac, a close-up of handwriting or the discovery of a previously ignored newspaper clipping become just as tense as any action scene. After all, this is a film about the case, so such close observation is as vital as it is entertaining.The acting is top class across the board, with Mark Ruffalo, a character actor who has gone underrated for far too long, standing out in the least showy role of the lead trio. Downey Jr. brings his natural charisma to the boozy, erratic Avery, and Gyllenhaal, given the most screen-time (his character wrote the book the film is based on) is a likable underdog. The characters aren't given much time to breathe between the fast-talk conversations and the digging for clues, but its the Zodiac himself that looms largest over the film. He is barely seen outside of the opening half hour, but his presence is never far away in Fincher's nervous San Francisco. And there lies the film's genius. Impeccably directed, brilliantly written, and utterly terrifying.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",Zodiac
83,Dr_Coulardeau,Frustrated unsolved case,9,22 July 2010,"A real criminal, a real serial killer and his ""adventures"". What makes this story interesting is the fact that the police never succeeded and never arrested the killer, in spite of the help of the media in San Francisco. It all amounted to circumstantial evidence and no indictment, not to mention conviction, was ever pronounced, hence no suspect declared and arrested. The case can come out today because all those who were suspected to have played a role in this sinister story are dead or out of the way. That will not change anything anyway because the case is now closed since the main yet undeclared suspect is dead. The real question is to know whether the police, the various police departments concerned did their job properly, if the inspectors did theirs and if their hierarchy supported them. It's always difficult to say especially with the role of the Attorney general or public prosecutor in the area. There are so many elements that may stop an investigation in the USA, particularly elections since the main characters in security forces are elected and local officials are the bosses of the Police. A lot can be said and a lot can be done, or undone or just not done. And that seems to be the case here. The film is slightly slow though and the attempt to dramatize it does not succeed entirely.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Créteil, CEGID",Zodiac
84,zkonedog,A Real-Life Mystery Of The Highest Order,10,4 March 2017,"Every year, thousands of mystery plots are created by film, television, and literature for our ""viewing pleasure"". Many (dare I say most) of them are conceived from a murder scenario. In the case of ""Zodiac"", however, it seems as if the biggest mystery of them all was right under our noses all the time.For a basic plot summary, ""Zodiac"" tells the story of the Zodiac killer in California from the late 1960s-early 1970s. In the early stages of the case, police investigator David Toschi (Mark Ruffalo) and SF Chronicle journalist Paul Avery (Robert Downey Jr.) struggle to catch the letter- writing, cypher-creating homicidal killer. In the end, however, it ends up being low-on-the- totem-poll Chronicle cartoonist Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhall) who puts all the pieces together...or does he?If you are a fan of action/adventure fare and like a lot of ""flash"" up on the big screen, please stay away from this movie. ""Zodiac"" is all about savoring the mystery, and thusly unfolds at pace that allows the thinking-viewing to do just that. Before seeing this movie, I had zero previous information about these murders (far, far before my time), so it was utterly fascinating to me to see the amount of time it took for everything to play out. At almost two and a half hours, viewers can't be looking at their watches or they will be missing the point.It would have been easy for ""Zodiac"" to come across as a B-movie cop drama, but I think that the presence of director David Fincher (""Se7en"", ""Fight Club"", ""The Social Network"", etc.) makes it into an all-time great. Fincher knows exactly how to walk the fine line of keeping a movie pretty much devoid of ""action"" (in the traditional blow/shoot-em-up Hollywood sense) from getting stale, and instead just continuing to build the tension with every scene.Thus, ""Zodiac"" is a film I can highly recommend to anyone who is a fan of mystery fare. The fact that it is based on real-life events makes it even more intriguing. Just make sure you go into the experience with the right mindset and with plenty of time to savor this kind of filmmaking. It truly is an underrated gem.",Zodiac
85,poe426,Exception to the rule...,10,22 March 2007,"Although movies about serial killers often have all the charm of a charnel house tour, this one proves the exception to the rule. That it's based on history is part of its power: seeing young lovers necking early on in the film becomes squirm-in-your-seat suspenseful when they realize that they are being cruised by... a mysterious stranger. Director Fincher manages to ratchet up the tension to an almost unbearable degree simply by allowing us to observe the mounting anxiety of the vulnerable victims. Like Hitchcock with PSYCHO, Fincher makes us- willing or unwilling (I'm sure there were some who covered their eyes at this point in the proceedings)- voyeurs. And it's this witness-to-the-scene-of-the-crime approach to storytelling that makes ZODIAC so riveting. We can watch, but we can't intervene. Now that's suspense.",Zodiac
86,eddie_baggins,Finchers' underrated gem,9,1 March 2016,"A movie that for David Fincher's lofty standards was met with a somewhat muted critical response and also a box office haul that didn't even scrap together enough to cover a $60 million dollar plus budget, Zodiac remains the directors true underrated gem and a film that deserves a place alongside some of cinemas best detective/murder procedural tales.Zodiac is a unique film, a based on real life account of the Zodiac killings that haunted the American populace in the late 60's and early 70's with a raft of public taunting's that often were followed with grizzly and seemingly random murders, it's a film that cares little for character development or the likes yet focus's its intentions and carefully crafted gaze on the investigation itself, throwing the audience into the time and into the thick of it to create tension and intrigue unlike many other such films.Working with the late D.O.P Harris Savides, Fincher delivered what could well be his most beautiful film yet made. Shooting in a striking visual palette, Fincher crafts his camera around the San Francisco cityscape and surrounding areas to striking effect. Building's form in front of our eyes, taxi's weave through the city at night and basements become more ominous than we could've ever imagined under his watchful eye and the script by James Vanderbilt (whose sadly not gone on with the promise shown here) does a great job at condensing the drawn out saga into a cohesive whole and his work on the film seems perfectly suited to a man of Fincher's powers.Zodiac's failings to initially make a mark upon release are hard to pinpoint, although there were lots of critics that hailed its slow paced stylings and dialogue heavy scenes, there were equal amounts of naysayers that seemed to prefer their Fincher more Fight Club than the procedural that takes place here, although the films sparring violence is haunting – a stabbing scene in particular is hard to forget – and the moments where Fincher takes us into the heart of suspect interrogation showcase a tension and unease that only the best of films can do.A great cast led by Jake Gyllenhaal, Mark Ruffalo and Robert Downey Jr do great work without ever taking over Zodiac and Fincher's film takes all its power and crafts all its magic through the use of its couldn't make it up if you tried narrative and an understanding of material that no doubt came from Fincher's renowned attention to detail.A long watch and a film not made for the average popcorn muncher that floods our cinema screen in this day and age in search of their next CGI spectacle, Zodiac is a meticulously crafted and tension riddled journey through a time in American history that to this day remains an intriguing and engaging subject matter, Zodiac is the hidden jewel of Fincher's filmography and a film well worth a repeat viewing for those that may've only watched once.4 ½ animal cracker boxes out of 5",Zodiac
87,johnnyboyz,Gripping and fascinating without having to bombard you with special effects or cheap gimmicks.,8,22 October 2007,"How pleasant it is to have a film like Zodiac be released during a time in which masses of computer generated imagery, sequels to films made years ago and out and out star power are the reasons to flock to see films. Releasing Zodiac in May, just before or perhaps right at the beginning of the summer rush for blockbuster supremacy was a very bold move and regardless of how it did, it will be one of the best films of the calendar year with possible Oscar nominations ready in waiting.Zodiac is a detective story that won't quit revolving around a non-detective who wont quit and also features a police detective who does sort of quit but then wants to help the non-detective for good measure. Zodiac's also a number of other things; it's someone's life story as they start out in a job at a newspaper, meet people, get married and have children; it's also a horror film of sorts with the murdering of teenage couples forming the basis of the shocks but it's a modern horror without the stupid teens basically sealing their fate since it's the killer who hunts them down rather than them putting themselves in venerable positions. The film is also an absolute lesson in cinematography amongst the acting, script and pacing since not only does it all look and sound good but you can look deeper into what we're seeing and hearing. An example of this is when a bloody rag is held up as evidence and the cheater exclaims that it's ""a window into his soul."" What's relevant here is that the rag is covered in black stripes making it look like a barred window you get in jails  it may be a window metaphorically but for the time being, it's a window that's cut off.We are spared any pleasantries involving Robert Graysmith (Gyllenhaal) who's a cartoonist at a San Francisco newspaper and instead get the gist of things of who he is through lighting and overall character. Gyllenhaal acts really well which is one thing but another is the fact that whenever Graysmith is on screen from the beginning, the 'introductory' phase, the light is very bright and revealing almost creating an angelic, innocent persona as opposed to everyone else's where the lighting is dark and grim; one such exempt time is when Graysmith is in the bar with the detective on the case: the lighting is bleak in the bar and yet the drink that arrives in front of Graysmith is light blue with umbrellas and a straw, keeping the theme running up to this point, at least. Of course; when Graysmith gets more involved, things change.Despite being called Zodiac and masquerading as a film revolving around San Francisco's notorious killer, the film dabs in and out of the killer's story and uses it as more of a backdrop than anything. This is nothing like Fincher's previous serial killer film Se7en in the sense it isn't two guys trying to crack a case of murder and confusion. The murder scenes are well done and the following phone calls add an eerie amount of realism, if the calls were real then all the more credit because it all works well when combined with the call to the television centre particularly standing out. Likewise, the demise of a certain character's overall life is embedded nicely into the story as we see everything from one man's point of view as we do with Graysmith's marriage and its tension.Interestingly, the final third of the film doesn't so much focus on the capturing of the killer as any other film would because this was based on real events and in the real world, it would seem that the good guys don't always win. Needless to say, Zodiac has never actually been caught but the film plays out like an aftermath of the infamous events that happened in the 1960s and 70s yet doesn't wander down familiar, cops and robbers territory like, say, Red Dragon (2002) did where loose ends are tied up and twists occur. Zodiac is gripping and involving in its own way and is a film that will surely have a better chance of withstanding the test of time than other films released these days.",Zodiac
88,filipemanuelneto,A very good suspense thriller.,8,14 March 2017,"This film deals with police investigations surrounding the crimes of Zodiac Assassin, a serial killer who plagued California without police officers having been able to discover him. It shows what police and the journalists did, and the letters the killer used to wrote, some of them containing codes that remain mostly undeciphered. The film is engaging, intense, and shows the link, sometimes difficult, between the media and the authorities, but the merit of the film is to give a broad view of what has happened over the years, being very faithful to the facts and keeping our attention when we already know the whole story.The pace is good, allowing us to see the details. It may seem a little slower than other thrillers, but I didn't feel I was wasting time on accessory things. The environment is tense enough to keep our interest without fear. Cinematography has been smartly for that purpose when required. Crimes are quite intense and give us some of the most dramatic scenes. I almost didn't noticed special effects, they knew how to be subtle. Jake Gyllenhaal, Robert Downey Jr., Anthony Edwards, Mark Ruffalo and John Carroll Lynch are the most notable actors in a vast and competent cast, but Gyllenhaal deserves a very special applause for the way he has built his character, a quiet individual who is interested in search the killer by his own means. It's undoubtedly a psychologically dense and strong character, and the actor was perfectly capable of dealing with that. Ruffalo, on the other hand, showed the dismay of the police, after years of wild-goose chase.I'm not sure, but I think Zodiac Case is still open in California. Anyway, this is a good thriller, true to the facts and with a strong, committed and capable cast. Even so, it's length, longer and slower than usual for this genre, can make some people lose their interest.",Zodiac
89,howard.schumann,An intelligent and involving film,8,26 March 2007,"Beginning in 1969 and continuing into the 70s, San Francisco papers were filled with stories about a mysterious serial killer who called himself the Zodiac. Taunting the police to discover his identity - letters, ciphers, puzzles, and clues filled the newspapers until the story became a daily media event. Based on two books, ""Zodiac"" and ""Zodiac Unmasked"" by Robert Graysmith, a former editorial cartoonist for the San Francisco Chronicle and on actual case files researched by the director, David Fincher's Zodiac dramatizes the search for the identity of the killer, focusing more on the lives of the reporters and police officers who investigate the case than on the killings and their victims. The case has never been solved and no arrests have ever been made, in spite of there being 2500 suspects including one very plausible possibility discussed in the film.Jake Gyllenhaal portrays Graysmith, an amateur detective who becomes interested in the case while working for the Chronicle. Though the killings stopped long ago, Graysmith continued to pursue leads long after the official investigation ceased. The world first heard about the Zodiac after two young people, Darlene Ferrin (Clara Hughes) and her friend Mike Mageau (Lee Norris) were shot in their parked car. Darlene was killed but Mike survived but was not asked to identify a suspect until many years later. Three weeks after the killing, a letter is received by the Chronicle that claims responsibility for the murder and an additional killing eight months prior.Calling himself the Zodiac, the letter includes a coded message that the killer claims will reveal his identity if decoded. The letter also says that unless the paper continues to print his letters, the killings will continue. Though his name is never revealed, the code is discovered by amateur sleuths to point to a 1932 film, The Most Dangerous Game, in which a killer enjoys hunting down and killing human victims. The Chronicle assigns their top crime reporter Paul Avery (Robert Downey Jr.) to cover the case. When cab driver Paul Stine is killed in San Francisco, two homicide detectives Inspector David Toschi (Mark Ruffalo) and his partner William Armstrong (Anthony Edwards) become involved and the focus of the film shifts to the police investigation.Fincher, like an episode of Dragnet, gives us just the facts and lets us draw our own conclusions while describing conversations, procedures, interviews, and searches of public and private records in minute detail. As the Zodiac keeps upping the ante, he holds the media hostage, threatening to attack a school bus filled with children if the paper does not cooperate in feeding his desire for publicity. Soon the Zodiac demands that Melvin Belli (Brian Cox), a popular Bay Area attorney, talk to him on television and when the program takes place, there is some reference to the killer's headaches but little comes of the conversation. Meanwhile Fincher details the growing strains that the investigation takes on the police and the reporters.Avery is taken off the case. Armstrong requests a transfer so that he can spend more time with his family, and Graysmith, who begins to investigate the case on his own, becomes so obsessed with finding the killer that his marriage to his wife Melanie (Chloe Sevigny) is put in jeopardy. Zodiac is an intelligent and involving film that holds our attention for the 158 minute running time but, perhaps because of the nature of the case, it is without key dramatic moments or even an overriding point of view, and is underplayed to the point that it doesn't fully convey the sense of fear and paranoia that gripped the Bay Area during that period. Yet Zodiac is as completely fascinating as All The President's Men in its roller coaster ride through tips, secret meetings, false leads, and hopes raised and then dashed. One only wishes that there could have been a Deep Throat to point investigators in the right direction.",Zodiac
90,TheMovieDiorama,"Zodiac, much like its cryptic codes, keeps you coming back for more.",9,4 March 2018,"I remember watching this for the first time a few years ago thinking it was an unmemorable slow drag. Revisiting this was an excellent idea. Why? Well my opinion has changed. Based on the Zodiac killings of California back in the late 60s, a journalist, cartoonist and homicide detective are entangled in a seemingly uncrackable case. With each murder, the killer leaves a cryptic message behind for the San Fransisco Chronicle to publish. On the surface this is a dark crime mystery, however underneath the authentic 60s production value is a story about obsession. How it can manifest and manipulate your mind, turning yourself into a determined individual but at the cost of losing your job, friends and family. These three employees became so fixated on publicising The Zodiac and attempting to uncover the suspect behind the codes, that actually it became a detriment to them. The lavish direction from renowned director David Fincher illustrated the case as if we, the viewers, were apart of the team. The evidence was meticulously presented so that we could attempt to work it out ourselves, which is where the thrills and emotional investment come into play. The slow paced story allowed the characters to truly interact with each other and become fully developed, thus conveying the concept of obsession enigmatically. Gyllenhaal, Ruffalo and Downey Jr had a fair share of screen time where each of the three acts focussed on one character in greater detail, whilst still progressing the case in a linear narrative. Not a easy task, but Fincher made it look effortless. The basement scene towards the end was heart pounding, Fincher did not need to conform to typical thriller traits to create suspense. The constant time hopping between scenes prevented a narrative flow, it felt disconnected occasionally. One day later, one year later, seven and a half years later...we get it, the case went on for a long time. Despite being a slow burner, this mystery will keep you glued to the screen.

As a movie it's almost perfect.,9,2 June 2007,"For those who can't accept it; this isn't David Fincher's best but still it's a class act addition to his rich filmography as director.As a fan of the Zodiac serial killer case , I am truly pleased by the movie overall. The events are treated in a way that people who study or simply enjoy Criminology or serial killers will be totally attached to the scenes and plot. There's room for suspense, claustrophoby, tension, and even good gore.Some may say that it is a boring movie but the slow pace inserted after the first half of the movie is just to make feel the audience what investigators and media overall felt : and that is the absence of the Zodiac. So with a series of scenes that didn't reach somewhere relevant we know that he may appear at any moment and there's a pleasant explanation for that towards the ending.The investigations, legal facts and proceedings are highly interest and will keep you hooked in. Excellent atmosphere in every scene and David Fincher is an expert in keeping attention at inserting minimal details that are important for the situation, historical moment, etc. For example, in the late 60's people could smoke in certain areas of airplanes.The acting is exceptional. Great performances by Gyllenhall and Downey Jr. Specially. Mark Ruffalo is an excellent actor and once again demonstrates his skills and that he deserves more important roles like this.The music is simply amazing. Every ""oldie"" song fits perfect in every scene. It set the atmosphere all the way. Excellent choises.The direction is masterful for being a movie that does not recquires dynamic or detailed cinematography or art direction. Still, Fincher manages to create an impressive visual looking movie that stands out of being called just a cop flick or something like that.I recommend this one for lovers of Criminology, for those who like the Zodiac case, or just for people who like good cinema.",Zodiac

The detectives' and journalists' wide-eyes slowly begin to sag as they seem to get further away from catching the infamous killer.

95,Movie_Muse_Reviews,Mind-wrapping murder mystery that goes beyond thrills,8,15 January 2009,"If books, movies and television have warped our minds in any way, one way is that we crave this cathartic clarity at the end of every mystery story we consume. We have to know who dunnit or we go berserk and these media have taken our natural instinct and turned it into our expectation. One would suppose that ""Zodiac,"" a murder mystery based on the real, infamous killings of the late 60s and 70s in the San Francisco area, is one of those films, and in many ways it is--but it's something more. ""Zodiac"" is not so much a film about solving a mystery as it is about the obsession that fuels it.David Fincher, who directed perhaps the greatest murder mystery of the 90s in ""Se7en,"" returns to the genre again to direct the more biographical and fact-based ""Zodiac."" With Fincher's expertise, Zodiac becomes a mystery that sucks in all your attention, building suspense and--more importantly--your mental and emotional investment. Like Fincher's previous work, the cinematography is strong, (he collaborates with Harris Savides once again from 1997's ""The Game"") the lighting and shadows helping to build the mystery shrouding your every thought.Basically, the story is so thoroughly told, with no detail in the case spared, that you become obsessed. Robert Graysmith (Gyllenhaal), the San Francisco Chronicle cartoonist that took it upon himself to pursue the case when the leads fizzled out, is a victim of that very obsession, and therein is why this is a very good film. The main character and the viewers are completely in sync--we identify so easily with him, feeling all his frustrations, watching his family life start to crumble away.Sometimes, this amped up perplexity for the purpose of creating the viewer's own obsession, does sacrifice the film's other elements. There's only so close we can get to the characters (all who are played very well), like Robert Downey Jr.'s Tim Avery, drug-abusing Chronicle reporter, or Mark Ruffalo as police detective David Toschi. With our brains so focused on the mystery, part of the human element of this film is lost. These were real people and the victims of these crimes were actually victims. But such is Hollywood, and the mystery elements are a precedent for marketing the film. At least Fincher doesn't let them completely dominate, awakening us to our dangerous obsession of mystery-solving.",Zodiac

May look like a simple who dunnit story, but this David Fincher classic is truly riveting!",10,21 February 2018,"Zodiac is a movie based on a true seventies story about the hunt for a serial killer. The true grit of this movie comes from the portraits of normal everyday people who are just losing it, bit by bit, while searching for clues who this mysterious serial killer could be.The suspense isnt found in violence being comitted but in violence being left in the shadows.It is always spookier when you dont know who is attacking you as is the case in this riveting movie that is based on a true story, depicted in several books by author Robert Graysmith.Director David Fincher (Seven) made a movie that creeps under my skin, but does so very slowly, clocking 2 and a half hours, without getting boring for a second. On the contrary, this movie keeps getting more and more intense towards the end.Besides the suspense there are simultaneously lots of really funny scenes in which the characters of Jake Gylenhaal and Robert Downey Jr, easily win you over with their unfortunate sink or swim charm. Well over 2 and a half hours long, this movie feels like it could have been even longer with still masses of suspense around each new plot turn.This movie gives me goosebumps writing about it, because it is performed, photographed, scored, and directed with such excellence that it can be watched over and over again and the suspense (and the jokes) are still as powerful as they were the first time around.

98,jzappa,Filmmakers Will Learn From This Film,9,4 March 2007,"The very first thing I will mention about Zodiac is its absolutely brilliant cinematography. The constantly dim lighting, the washing of scenes in tan and taupe, the overall grittiness, capture powerfully David Fincher's seamless attention to ardent period details. Every single spec of the screen is at all times ensured as a precise replica of the time in history that the film portrays. That includes perfect costumes, even when people are dressed shabbily and informally, hairstyles, and other visual touches in that field. The use of music of the times is very effective, executed in a similar style as Scorsese and Spike Lee would tend to place certain retro hits in scenes of violence and montages, meticulously and subtly manipulating the volume. The scenes wherein we are given glimpses of the Zodiac's cruel work have great dramatic effect. Overall, the atmosphere of this film is scrumptiously dark and eery, even though the majority of it follows the three men leading their own branches of investigation.This film, as wonderfully made as it sounds, spoils itself with its excessive length. I am usually one of those people in the audience who savors a film that runs two and a half or three hours, because I think longer movies tend to leave a deep impact, they're more passionate, and they have longer, more drawn-out stories and even single scenes. The problem with Zodiac is that its length is unneeded. There is a bit that can be cut. Because the movie runs longer than it should, the effect of the cinematography, the period details, and the dark atmosphere lose effect. Like most good things, too much can spoil your appetite. By the arrival of the last forty-five minutes, one is full. And by then, perhaps because the movie realizes it needs to cram the information it hasn't given yet, it becomes more of a seminar on the Zodiac killer than a story, the characters explaining and the closing texts that true stories often end with being too much and too long. The movie does not decrease to the point where it is bad. It simply tapers in impact.The cast is great. Mark Ruffalo, Anthony Edwards, and Jake Gyllenhaal create very realistic people. Robert Downey, Jr. plays himself, rivetingly and entertainingly, even if his end of the story could easily be a good deal of what could be cut. Chloe Sevigny delivers well, the timid element of her role being usual for her and the straight-laced maturity being the opposite. Brian Cox serves a bit of dry comic relief in his role as a laid back yet tightly wound doctor with a hint of snobbery.",Zodiac
99,Vartiainen,Lackluster and slow-paced,4,19 July 2012,"The problem with crime movies based on true events is that there's rarely any coherent story arc to be found in the real world. There's always a beginning, certainly, sometimes even a sensible progression from one elemental plot point to another, and if we're lucky, there's even an ending. The thing that bothers Zodiac and so many other films is the fact that the opposite also holds true. Quite often crimes go unpunished. Sometimes we are left hanging in empty air, with no paths left to search and investigate. And that hanging is extremely frustrating and, in my opinion, doesn't make for a good story. A story is all about fiction. It's about forming a whole story, one that has something to tell to its viewers/listeners/observers. A story without a satisfying ending is rarely worth telling.And yet I wouldn't call Zodiac a bad movie, even though its ending leaves something to be desired. David Fincher is a talented director and I see in this film many of the same elements that made Se7en such a great film. The same gritty film noir style, the same hopeless determination that drives the protagonists forward, the same brutality in showing the murder victims. Unfortunately this movie lacks the extraordinary qualities of Se7en. The Zodiac killer is a shocking figure to be sure, but the movie portrays him as a stumbling character with luck on his side. There's no tension, drama or fear-filled awe to be found in him.It's a shame really. This movie had the potential to be great. The actors work, the directing work, the filming and editing work. All these individual aspects of a movie work. It's just the real-life story and its limitations that keep the movie back. Now it's just slow and at times rather boring film that leaves its viewers unsatisfied and disappointed. If you can deal with its limitations, this movie is a great piece of crime drama. If you can't... need I say any more.",Zodiac
100,robert-temple-1,"It sprawls across time, across characters, and across victims",5,29 June 2011,"This is a vast, sprawling, and lengthy film directed by David Fincher, which gets nowhere in the end, and was probably a pointless exercise. It is the story of a search for a psychotic serial killer who calls himself 'Zodiac'. The story is based upon real case files from California, and covers several decades. Characters come and go, and it is difficult to keep focus on any of them, as they are so transient and lightly-sketched. The mysterious 'Zodiac', who was never found, drew his inspiration from a film of the 1930s, THE MOST DANGEROUS GAME, aka THE HOUNDS OF ZAROFF (1932), with Fay Wray and Joel McCrea. In that film, a man hunts humans as if they are animals, for sport. I have seen the earlier 1930s film, and it is rather mediocre, in addition to being distasteful, hence not worth reviewing, no matter how much one may like Fay Wray. There was a time when it was thought shocking enough to make films about killers. But those days are long gone. So jaded are the tastes of contemporary audiences that only serial killers will do, as one murder is no longer shocking at all. This is, of course, a sign of decadence, when murder no longer shocks, and only a series of ingenious murders by a brilliant clever psychopath any longer has the power to titillate (note that I say titillate rather than shock). I really don't believe movies like this should be made, as I have said before, and I shall say again.",Zodiac

As a docu-drama, it is surprisingly entertaining. If forensics, criminal histories, journalistic intrigues, or serial killers are of an interest to you, this movie will hold you in thrall.I thoroughly enjoyed this work, and can't wait to include it into my DVD collection.It rates an 8.6/10 from...the Fiend :.",Zodiac
102,Chris Knipp,"A dogged, frustrating film but a new approach for Fincher",8,10 March 2007,"David Fincher's Zodiac, like Billy Ray's Breach, approaches what's normally a sensational theme (finding a murderer; catching a spy) in a flat and realistic way. The critics prefer Zodiac; the public prefers Breach. Breach has a payoff. The spy gets caught, even if the process of getting him is more sweaty than flashy. Zodiac exhaustively explores a serial killer case that was never solved. Zodiac lacks any of the fulfillment of traditional drama and storytelling. Zodiac gives us police procedure, rather than a ""police procedural."" Therein lies Zodiac's strength. The case is exciting, lurid, but without a payoff. The pleasure of chasing clues for their own sake has never been shown in a movie. The excitement of such a story usually derives from a progression that here never happens.As Walter Chaw puts it, ""Zodiac deals in millennial anxieties: the un-'catchable' foe; the unknowable cipher; the futility of the best efforts of good and smart men."" In his admiring Village Voice review, Nathan Lee says, ""The result is an orgy of empiricism, a monumental geek fest of fact-checking, speculation, deduction, code breaking, note taking, forensics, graphology, fingerprint analysis, warrant wrangling, witness testimony, phone calls, news reports. 'I felt like I was stuck in a filing cabinet for three hours,' complained one viewer. Exactly!"" For Lee, that was intriguing and radical. For me it was simply demoralizing. Zodiac is, after all, a movie. And with its able cinematographer Harris Savides and its cast of well known actors, it declares itself to be a movie at every turn, despite its scrupulous adherence to the known.As Zodiac makes its way through its excruciating two and a half hours, the attention gradually, and necessarily, shifts from the elusive killer to a straight arrow named Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal), a newspaper cartoonist and former Eagle Scout whose obsession with the case is marginally intense enough to keep us going. At least it keeps him going. While traditional crime movies focus on cases that get solved, the payoff this time is that Graysmith writes a book. And his book is the main source of this film, whose screenplay he coauthored. What's Graysmith doing now? Nathan Lee tells us: he's writing a book called Shooting Zodiac, about the production of this film.This is a change for Fincher. His career high points are the flashy, cultish Se7en and Fight Club, with the less stellar The Game and Panic Room in between. Se7en, like Zodiac, concerns a serial killer, but the earlier film is shocking, thrilling, horrifying. Even though Zodiac shows gruesome killings and attempted killings, they feel ugly rather than exciting. They're necessary to understand what the staff of the San Francisco Chronicle (where Graysmith worked as a cartoonist at the time) and various law enforcement agencies are worked up about.The self-identified Zodiac killer kept Californians terrorized for ten months of 1968 and 1969. There were seven verified victims, of whom two survived. The Zodiac stayed in the news by writing taunting letters and cryptograms to the newspapers up until 1974. He spoke of man as the most dangerous prey of all and killing people as fun. He made many threats -- including a promise to kill all the kids on a school bus. He claimed many other victims, but none was verified. There were many suspects, only one seriously investigated, Arthur Leigh Allen (John Carroll Lynch), who's repeatedly questioned and searched. There was much circumstantial evidence against him but no physical evidence, and the police decided not to press charges. The file was closed, then reopened in 2004. No one was ever caught. The FBI, local and state police, and various press people and experts were drawn into the tangled case. Fincher draws on top people to tell this story, which is based largely on screenplay coauthor Graysmith's original book. When eccentric celebrity lawyer Melvin Belli gets drawn into the case, he has Brian Cox to play Belli (Cox is always good, but he's not as fussy or elegant as the real Belli was). When the director needs someone to play a substance-abusing San Francisco Chronicle writer who became identified with the case, he uses Robert Downey Jr, who surely knows this territory. For the straight-arrow Chronicle cartoonist Graysmith it's Jake Gyllenhaal. Because Gyllenhaal is appealing and righteous with a slight edge of excessive intensity, he's well cast. For the thankless role of Graysmith's date, then his wife, whose main importance is that she has to take a secondary role to Zodiac, the sympathetic Chloë Sevigny was called in. For David Toschi, a chief police inspector on the case -- like Avery, Graysmith, and his wife, one of its casualties -- we get Mark Ruffalo (using a light voice that's a little too artificial and attention-catching). For the handwriting expert who retires and turns to drink, Sherwood Morill (another casualty?) Fincher gives us Philip Baker Hall. There are also familiar incidental faces like those of Dermot Mulroney, James Le Gros, Anthony Edwards(as Toschi's parter William Armstrong, and another casualty), Elias Koteas, Clea DuVall, and many others. It's a good cast but maybe a too recognizable one for what purports to be something like vérité. This is without mentioning the darker shadow world of incidental informers and suspects, who while (perhaps fortunately) are less recognizable, seem equally well chosen.Probably because of the Zodiac's taunting letters and the way the case was publicized, he's been a great influence on popular fiction and film and the public mind. Eight movies relate to him, including Dirty Harry, and at least five novels and several graphic novels as well as numerous pop songs. But does this make a great movie? Fincher's epic, in some ways impressive, version is engrossing but ultimately frustrating.",Zodiac

104,freemantle_uk,Zodiac - the Directors Cut review,9,26 June 2009,"David Fincher has made a good career for himself making thrillers, Se7en and Fight Club both excellent films. Zodiac is another fine addition to Fincher's filmography.Zodiac tells the story of the infamous Zodiac killer who terrorised the San Francisco area in the late 60s and early 70s. He played mind tricks with the media and the police, sending letters to newspapers, including the San Francisco Chronicle. The focus of the film is on Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal), a political cartoonist for the Chronicle and a single parent. He is good at puzzles and takes an interest in the Zodiac case. Other major characters are Paul Avery (Robert Downey Jr.), the crime reporter for the newspaper and San Francisco police detectives Dave Toschi (Mark Ruffalo) and Bill Armstrong (Anthony Edwards) who were all investigating the case. The media and the police have to work together in the case, especially because the killer makes violence threats. After more murders the police do find a prime suspect and the media get involved in the investigation, but are unable to press charges because some of the evidence doesn't fit.Years later, Robert Graysmith is still interested in the Zodiac case, even though he is married and has more children. He ends up investigating the case himself, started to write a book. He ends up being obsessed, his wife Melanie (Chloë Sevigny) becomes worried for the family's safety.Zodiac has an excellent cast, Robert Downey Jr. had done really well recently with Iron Man and Tropic Thunder. Mark Ruffalo was a good as the determined police officer. There are even good supporting actors such as Brian Cox, an amazing actor. Jake Gyllenhaal seemed a little too young for his role, but he is very talented actor and I ended up believing in his performance.Fincher is a talented director, know exactly when to add to the tension and has a very stylist type of directing. The beginning is shot in the style of a 60s film and the rest, in a modern thriller. It has a similar feel to All the President's Men. A smart move by Fincher is never showing the killer's face.James Vanderbilt also writes a good script for the film, looking at the police investigation, the media and the way the 60s and 70s were. I am looking for to see his work with Spiderman 4.Zodiac was a excellent thriller and it was a shame that it was nominated for Oscars such at Best Picture, Best Director and Best Actor, even if it couldn't win.",Zodiac
105,dfranzen70,Look for crime thrillers - betcha pinch a Finch,9,22 August 2007,"The true-crime thriller is one of the toughest kind of movies to make, because so many of the viewing audience will already be familiar with the storyline and can more easily anticipate what happens next. And the toughest true-crime thriller to make is probably one in which the culprit, in real life, was never caught. Then what do you do, hotshot? What do you do? If you're director David Fincher, you focus the plot not on the killings or on the resolution of the case but rather on the massive manhunt and intrepid detective work turned in by Inspectors David Toschi (Mark Ruffalo) and William Armstrong (Anthony Edwards) as well as the unofficial sleuthing by newspapermen Paul Avery (Robert Downey, Jr.) and Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal). Thus humanizing the forces attempting to bring the Zodiac to justice, Fincher is able to not only tell the tale straightforwardly but also scare the bejezus out of his audience, as is his wont. By identifying with the four leads, the audience has no choice but to hope against hope - knowing what it knows of the real story - that somehow good will persevere.Of the four leads, the weak spot might be assumed to be the callow Gyllenhaal, but as it turns out he's easily the strongest link in a tough chain of thespians. Graysmith, on whose book the movie is based, doggedly pursued the case as the paper's cartoonist, much to the chagrin of those around him - his employers, his colleagues, and his wife (Chloe Sevigny) and kids. Graysmith MUST KNOW what happened. He wants to look Zodiac in the eye and somehow determine his culpability. Gyllenhaal - who should change his name to an easier to spell surname - is absolutely aces, which is a phrase I never thought I'd type regarding Jake Gyllenhaal. He's never impressed me, looking to have exactly one emotion - moroseness - and I've always thought he was far too highly rated, But here, young Jake has won me over, just as Josh Hartnett did with Lucky Number Slevin and Kate Winslet did with any number of films after the awful Titanic. Gyllenhaal is superb, believable, and sincere in a commanding performance.The others aren't slouches, of course. Downey, Jr., aping Al Pacino from Serpico - except not playing a burned-out cop, just a burned-out reporter - is appreciatively scuzzy as Avery, a man never too far from a dangling cigarette or a murky drop of alcohol. Ruffalo and Edwards (where's he been?) are a perfect match as two cops as desperate as Graysmith to find out the killer's identity, all the while trying to coordinate with other jurisdictions, the press, and the public. Ruffalo in particular is a treat to watch, and I'm not going on a limb when I say that someday that young man will have an Oscar nom to his credit.Fincher creates a edgy atmosphere throughout - you honestly believe Zodiac will leap out from any corner's shadows to knife or gun you down. He also achieves the tough task of showing the passage of time efficiently - by showing the construction of a San Francisco skyscraper in stop-motion. Nice touches like that can make a film. And of course, Fincher is no stranger to descending to the depths of ourselves, what with movies like Seven, Panic Room, and Fight Club to his credit. With Zodiac, he's managed to take a riveting story and make it even more compelling - even without a compelling ending in real life.",Zodiac

107,ackstasis,"""I need to stand there, I need to look him in the eye and I need to know that it's him.""",9,12 June 2007,"Between December 1968 and October 1969, a serial killer, who had dubbed himself the Zodiac, operated in Northern California, murdering a confirmed five people, though other potential victims have been proposed. Up until 1974, the killer continued to taunt police and the media with a series of gloating and threatening handwritten letters, in one of which he threatened to execute an entire bus-load of school children. The Zodiac seemingly derived his name from a brand of wristwatch, and his incentive to kill  suggested by a cryptogram he sent along with one letter  was taken from 'The Most Dangerous Game,' a famous short story from Richard Connell, in which a game hunter turns to hunting humans because they are the only quarry worthy of his skill. Despite the best efforts of the San Francisco Police Department, and others investigators such as author Robert Graysmith, the true identity of the elusive Zodiac remains, to this day, a mystery.After the success of such films as 'Se7en,' 'Fight Club' and 'Panic Room,' director David Fincher has turned his sights away from straight thrillers and fallen upon Robert Graysmith's true-crime novel, 'Zodiac.' Adapted by James Vanderbilt, the film opens on July 4 1969, with the shooting of Michael Mageau (Lee Norris) and Darlene Ferrin (Ciara Hughes) by a perpetrator who remains hidden in the shadows. After the killer sends a taunting letter to the 'San Francisco Chronicle', crime reporter Paul Avery (Robert Downey Jr.) is assigned to follow the case, whilst newspaper cartoonist Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal) takes an active interest in the killer. After the Zodiac's fifth confirmed murder, of taxi driver Paul Lee Stine on October 11 1969, Inspector David Toschi (Mark Ruffalo) of the SFPD attempts to trace the serial killer, his desire becoming an obsession that will later threaten to destroy his life.It is possible that some viewers, expecting a slick and stylish Hollywood serial killer film, will be disappointed with 'Zodiac,' since Fincher has chosen to focus largely on how the hunt for the killer has destroyed the lives of those trying to bring him to justice. We linger on the victims themselves only briefly, and the homicides themselves are all orchestrated well before the mid-point of the film. By constantly reminding us that this is a true story, and by keeping the attention to detail as accurate as possible, Fincher has masterminded an entirely engrossing police procedural, in which the obsessive but futile search for the murderer is more absorbing than the murders themselves. With the real-life case being an unsolved mystery, the ending does not reach any solid conclusions on the identity of the killer, though, by laying out the evidence as it is, the film does manage to convey a certain sense of resolution, effectively avoiding the anti-climax that seemed almost inevitable. A meticulous recreation of the crime investigation, consisting largely of characters' personal and phone conversations, the film-making style of 'Zodiac' draws obvious parallels with such films as Alan J. Pakula's 'All the President's Men (1976),' of which Fincher confesses to being a fan.The acting from everybody involved in 'Zodiac' proves a real asset. Downey Jr. is excellent as the sarcastic and darkly humorous reporter Paul Avery, who would later descend into worrying bouts of alcoholism. Mark Ruffalo, delivering perhaps the finest performance in the film, is perfect as David Toschi, who tried for many years, in vain, to bring the Zodiac to justice, the case threatening to consume his life. Jake Gyllenhaal, though perhaps lacking the presence of his co-stars, is notable as Robert Graysmith, whose fixation with the serial killer would lead him to write two best-selling non-fiction books on the subject, upon which this film was based.John Carroll Lynch is disturbingly unsettling as Arthur Leigh Allen, the number one suspect for the murders, and the only person to have been seriously investigated by detectives. Despite being faced with seemingly damning amounts of circumstantial evidence, Allen vehemently denied being the Zodiac killer, and handwriting comparisons (and, more recently, DNA testing) yielded negative results. Graysmith, however, was convinced that Allen must be the killer, and the scene in which he tracks him down to ""look him in the eye to know that it's him"" is extremely effective; it is the moment in which Graysmith frees himself from the grasp of the Zodiac's enigma, allowing him to recapture his life. In order to keep the identity of the killer in doubt, Fincher employed the use of three different actors to portray the Zodiac for the various murder scenes (Richmond Arquette, Bob Stephenson, John Lacy), based on witness descriptions from each of the incidents. Notably, John Carroll Lynch is not used in any of these sequences.Excellent cinematography by Harris Savides beautifully captures the mood and style of the late 1960s and early 1970s in America. Interestingly, to shoot the film, Savides made use of the digital Thomson Viper Filmstream camera, which has previously been employed by Michael Mann in such films as 'Collateral' and 'Miami Vice,' though 'Zodiac' is the first feature-length Hollywood film to be shot entirely in the Viper's uncompressed digital data format. Though I would have expected digital cinematography to detract from the nostalgic atmosphere of the film, I really didn't even notice the difference. A mixture of popular songs from the era, and original music by David Shire, also complement the film well.I'll stop short of referring to David Fincher's 'Zodiac' as a masterpiece, but, needless to say, it is truly a remarkable film that will, no doubt, continue to hold firm for many years. In one of his chilling letters, the Zodiac killer gloated that he was still waiting for a good movie to be made about him. Assuming that this mysterious serial killer is still about somewhere (Arthur Leigh Allen died from a fatal heart attack on August 26 1992), his wait is now officially over.",Zodiac

It will be a tiny risk if you spend two hours and a half of your time watching the sensational Fincher ""Zodiac"". You will be transcended by Fincher's genial depiction of the still unsolved Zodiac mystery and the obsession brought upon it by law enforcement, journalists, and even amateur sleuths. And I am not feeding you no Taurus bull either! Gemini: Yesterday's unhelpful influences are likely to ease only a little: communications will be tricky, with silly misunderstandings escalating tensions. Don't be afraid to take a breather or suggest a little time out if a mini-row develops. A good mood can be restored if you offer the olive branch! A good mood can also be restored by locking in to the splendid subtle-comedic performance of Robert Downey Jr. as gabby San Francisco Chronicle reporter Paul Avery in ""Zodiac"". It does have my support as one of the ""gems"" in supporting acting this year! The Zodiac hounded Avery with death threats so much that many San Franciscans started wearing ""I Am Not Avery"" buttons! Cancer: Romance will offer some nice surprises today, but there's a danger that you'll be a little too absorbed in how great things are for you to notice someone's, possibly a friend's slumping mood. Be altruistic today: pay attention to the person who needs you, even if it means putting romance on hold for a little while! You can be altruistic by treating someone you love to a nice surprise and buying them the next Two-Disc Zodiac DVD with a plethora of special features! Leo- Leos, with their love of fun and extravagance, have been known to make grand, over-the-top gestures from time to time, and today is one of those days where you are likely to do just that, especially when it comes to romance! Rein it in a little: you don't need to break the bank to impress someone! A nice gesture from the Academy would of have been to nominate James Vanderbilt's insightful ""Zodiac"" screenplay for a Best Adapted Screenplay Oscar. I guess most of the Academy members are not Leos! Virgo- You are likely to wake up feeling like you just want to avoid the whole rigmarole of the day, but the planets suggest that you'll be pleasantly surprised by the end of the day. A dip in your confidence levels is what's bringing you down: believe it or not, you'll attract a lot of positive attention! Lots of positive attention is what should have been received by critics for Jake Gyllenhaal's neurotically obsessed performance as Robert Graysmith, the former San Francisco Chronicler cartoonist who took a profound vested interest in the Zodiac investigation and actually started one up himself years after Zodiac signs were obsolete. Graysmith ended up authoring the best seller Zodiac books which the film is based on.Libra- You might have the day all worked out: what to do; when to do it; where; how and even why, but their might be one little detail you've overlooked, and that is: who! Whether you celebrate the day according to tradition or not you will need to be inclusive; you will need to consider others! And that is what I will do! I will consider other actors besides Gyllenhaal and Downey who were wondrous with their performances including: Mark Ruffalo as lead investigator David Toschi; I should do my own investigation why it was not nominated for a Best Actor Oscar. Brian Cox as defense attorney/radio show host Melvin Belli, Anthony Edwards as Toschi's partner William Armstrong, and Chloe Sevigny as Graysmith's second wife Melanie round out the stellar acting signs of ""Zodiac"". I must single out John Carroll Lynch's scene stealing performance as Zodiac main suspect Arthur Leigh Allen as freakishly as they come. And too think that this Allen frenzied was in the Libra for so long is quite scary! Scorpio- You're likely to have a fabulous day in terms of romance, and an excellent aspect from the moon suggests that you'll be the center of attention, because someone is going to sit up and take notice of you today! There will also be the chance to get something off your chest once and for all! Unfortunately, director extraordinary David Fincher was not the center of attention during Oscar time by being snubbed for a Best Director nomination. I just wanted to get that off my chest.Can this review be any longer????? So I am skipping the rest of the signs! Anyway, I think I covered my viewpoints of ""Zodiac"" from Horoscope A to Z! ***** Excellent",Zodiac
109,kevin_robbins,"I remember when this came out and all of the bad press it received; watching it again, I really don't understand why.",9,17 June 2021,"Zodiac (2007) is a movie I recently watched on a Delta flight. The storyline follows a serial killing in California who evades the police for almost 20 years and depicts both the police strategy for catching him and the various suspects who they uncovered. This movie is directed by David Fincher (Se7en) and stars Jake Gyllenhaal (Donnie Darko), Robert Downey Jr. (Iron Man), Mark Ruffalo (The Avengers), Brian Cox (Troy) and John Carroll Lynch (Fargo). The storyline and detail in this is excellent and very well portrayed. I remember when this came out and all of the bad press it received; watching it again, I really don't understand why. Maybe because it doesn't conclude how people hoped. The acting, details about the case, various theories, plots and subplots were all very entertaining. For someone who doesn't know this case this is good movie to watch. Overall I'd score this a 8.5-9/10 and strongly recommend this.",Zodiac
110,FilmCriticLalitRao,Zodiac is a true suspense film directed by master film maker David Fincher,10,7 January 2009,"American film maker David Fincher has directed ""Zodiac"" with his usual style which consists of keeping the viewers guessed about the fate of the film that they are watching.One sure thing that can be said about ""Zodiac"" is that it is not so loud as other films directed by David Fincher such as ""Fight Club"" and ""Seven"".Zodiac is a brilliant suspense film which retains viewers' attention as it concentrates on the roles played by all sides who are involved in the nabbing of a serial killer who terrorized USA in 1960s.This is the primary reason why journalists,police and suspects receive equal and undivided attention from the director. Zodiac scores heavily due to the acting prowess of its leading players. Jake Gyllenhaal is absolutely charming as cartoonist Robert Graysmith who decides to track down the elusive serial killer using his own ingenuous methods.Watching him play this role,one might wonder why a simple minded cartoonist is interested in unraveling the truth behind some of the most obscure killings in the state of California. Mark Ruffalo appears nice too as Inspector David Toschi who puts all his energy to bring the serial killer to justice but in vain.One can sympathize with the character of a determined police officer played by Mark Ruffalo as he gets frustrated due to the fact that many years of his hard work have resulted in nothing but humiliation and hopelessness as the serial killer has not been caught by the police.Robert Downey Jr does ample justice to his role of a boring crime journalist Paul Avery who loses all interest in the case.As far as feminine presence is concerned,kudos to Chloë Sevigny for her role as Robert Graysmith's girl friend and life partner Melanie. She plays a vital role in his life by looking after his children and also by being besides him whenever he his in trouble.Zodiac is a film for those who are prepared to understand why senseless killings are perpetrated by people who seem to have lost their mental balance.",Zodiac
111,st-shot,Well crafted Zodiac a suspenseful search.,8,2 August 2008,"Films based in fact often play fast and loose with the truth. Witness the semi slanderous history lessons of Oliver Stone. The story of the Zodiac, a serial killer who terrorized San Francisco and other California counties in the 60s and 70s has sensationalism written all over it since he was never officially caught. A filmmaker undertaking the project would have a myriad of options to fictionalize the fact that the Zodiac existed. Judging from his previous blood and guts works (7even, Fight Club) I expected another lengthy gore fest from director David Fincher. I was thankfully mistaken. While there are some brutal and violent moments, Zodiac spends most of it's time battering its characters psychologically in their frustrating decades long search for the killer. It's a gripping portrait from end to end.Over two and a half hours in length Zodiac steadily maintains suspense throughout as the investigation veers in all directions with false leads,wrong suspects and police departments failing to coordinate. Fincher uses his three major characters almost as a relay team to run the course of the film. Editorial cartoonist Robert Graysmith (Jake Gylenhal)police inspector David Toschi (Mark Ruffalo) and reporter Paul Avery(Robert Downey Jr.) doggedly pursue leads but over the years fatigue and burn out set in. Erratic behavior leads to discord and suspicion as we watch each character stumble.Fincher ably captures the times and the city of San Francisco living in a state of fear which includes a clip from a film made during that time about the Zodiac called Dirty Harry. He eschews the pro-vigilante theatrics of this classic in favor of presenting the truth and adding depth without diluting the suspense making Zodiac a draining but engrossing experience.",Zodiac
112,MaxBorg89,"Paced, suspenseful, gripping - the first real must-see of 2007!",10,27 May 2007,"It is about a serial killer. And it is directed by David Fincher. Se7en 2? Absolutely not. Fincher has never repeated himself, and there is no way he will start now. Se7en was a terrifying, unflinching thriller that offered no hope or comfort; Zodiac is equally bleak, but at the same time unlike any other serial killer movie made before.For the first time, Fincher handles a true story, and a pretty dark one for that matter: with five confirmed murders and another thirty-two he claimed responsibility for, the Zodiac was the American version of Jack the Ripper. Like the English psychopath, Zodiac was never captured (the police interrogated several suspects, with no results), and the two also shared a fascination for sending letters to the authorities, making fun of people's foolish attempts to uncover their identities. It is this aspect that interests the director: the killer's relationship with law enforcement and media. There is no room for the actual murderer or his grand plan (not that he has one), like in Se7en; Zodiac is a tale of obsession, of how one man indelibly affected four people who spent most of their lives trying to solve one of the USA's greatest mysteries.The film begins on the fourth of July, 1969: a young couple making out in a car is brutally attacked by an unknown assailant. The girl dies, the boy lives and leaves San Francisco, and the killer sends a letter to the S.F. Chronicle, taking credit for the crime and inviting the reporters to identify with a cypher he has enclosed to the message. Chronicle cartoonist Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal) immediately asserts the cypher is bogus, and is indeed proved right, but at the same time he develops an unusual interest for the Zodiac, and joins the booze-addicted Paul Avery (Robert Downey Jr., who gives the film's most affecting, painfully real performance) on a quest to solve the puzzle. As they keep seeking the truth, their paths cross with those of David Toschi (Mark Ruffalo, the other standout in a mesmerizing ensemble) and Bill Armstrong (Anthony Edwards, in his first relevant role since he left E.R.), two SFPD detectives whose only thought is to find the elusive psycho and lock him up forever.The case goes on for several years (the final scene's caption reads ""1991""), and in order to accurately depict those years Fincher didn't just use Graysmith's books Zodiac and Zodiac Unmasked as basis for the screenplay, he also reread old files and even talked to anyone who was personally involved in the events (which is why not all the murders are shown on screen: the director omitted those for which he could not find a surviving victim or witness), which explains why it took so long to complete the film (Fincher's last effort, Panic Room, was released in 2002). This attention to detail pays off, as we are offered as complete a recollection as there can be of the facts, spread over 160 minutes that never feel stretched or boring: the story hooks the viewer right from the beginning and never lets go, its content being too unsettling and important to be ignored. Unlike From Hell, which upset a lot of people for its theories regarding the Ripper's real name and motive, Fincher does not try to make the audience believe anything, but simply tells what has been verified, although it is obvious he shares the characters'feelings towards the prime suspect (Arthur Leigh Allen, played with nerve-cracking conviction by John Carroll Lynch). He does not even show off with his usual camera trickery (the only exception being a scene where the accelerated construction of the Transamerica building indicates that a year has passed), not because, as some might claim, he has ""matured"", but because he felt that was right for the kind of story he is telling. Zodiac is more similar to All The President's Men than Se7en, and like Alan J. Pakula's masterpiece it is all about time, place and character, not action or blood.At one point, Paul Avery says: ""He offed a few citizens, wrote a few notes and faded into a footnote"". Therein lies the movie's true nature: it is not interested in telling the story of a killer, partly because this particular criminal has already been used by Hollywood (Dirty Harry's Scorpio was based on the Zodiac), but that of a group of ordinary people so desperate to give a face to the name that haunted them they spent decades working on a case they knew from the start would not be solved.Fincher considers his sixth film ""the definitive serial killer film"". He has got a point: by giving no real answers or glimpses of optimism he sets Zodiac apart from traditional thrillers, which will all seem like fairy tales in comparison. The real thing is much more complex and painful, but also, in the end, far more compelling than the usual mainstream product. An astonishing achievement, and the year's first truly unmissable movie.9,5/10",Zodiac
113,Chris_Docker,A constellation of clues that may leave you bored with the puzzle,6,2 June 2007,"The movie covers a period of over 30 years and the difficult quest to identify Zodiac, a serial killer. Early on in the film, the Lynchian (Blue Velvet) device of contrasting violence with gentle music erupts with Donovan's hippie ballad, Hurdy Gurdy Man. Only this Hurdy Gurdy man isn't singing songs of love. He is shooting, stabbing, playing catch-me-if-you can, and generally wearing the police down.The lack of a logical progression towards solving the crimes evokes a reality that the cinematography is also aiming at, sepia hues suggesting noir of an indeterminate era. It's claim to be based on actual case files rings reasonably true. There are echoes of Director David Fincher's earlier work, Seven, but without the luridness. The central character, Robert Graysmith, is based on a real person who wrote a number of books about the real serial killer.Graysmith (played by Jake Gyllenhaal) is a cartoonist at the San Francisco Chronicle. His hobby is solving puzzles. Zodiac, who sends cryptic clues to the newspapers, is his dream come true. Following the trail over more years than the police have patience for, Graysmith labours unrelentingly to find the identity of the killer.Gyllenhall is a strength and weakness. He has screen charisma, but maybe not enough to carry the whole movie. His character lacks the depth or maturity displayed by Mark Ruffalo as the weary Colombo-esquire cop or the top lawyer played by Brian Cox. The realism of the film is questioned by his home-boy appeal, even if we warm to it.Occasional special effects (such as a speeded up construction of a building) also jar. The symbolism seems too weak. Fans of double meanings may work many psychological references into the interplay of terrorizer and terrorized, but the film is overly long. I found myself eventually not really caring who the killer was. Only two or three scenes (a murder, a woman driving with her baby, and Graysmith coming out of the rain into a uncannily threatening house to dig up clues) have any tension. The rest left me less than gripped. Endless details, false leads, tenuous clues and waffling plot.¨Nobody has more Zodiac crap than you do,¨ exclaims Graysmith's long-suffering partner. And it seems the producers spared no expense cramming every drop of it into the film.",Zodiac
114,Lechuguilla,"""This Is The Zodiac Speaking""",7,2 March 2007,"With those five words and with countless threats and baffling cryptograms, a serial killer terrorized the San Francisco Bay Area in the late 60s and early 70s. In the thirty-five years since the attacks, the only suspect ever officially named in the case was Arthur Leigh Allen. Yet, recent DNA analysis seems to have eliminated Allen as a suspect. Like Jack the Ripper, the Zodiac's identity remains, to this day ... unknown.There have been a couple of other films about the Zodiac. But Director David Fincher's thriller is by far the most ambitious and high profile. Based on two books by researcher Robert Graysmith, the film starts off with reenactments of some of the killer's attacks. Most of the film, however, follows three men who were involved in the original investigation: Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal), Inspector Toschi (Mark Ruffalo), and reporter Paul Avery (Robert Downey, Jr.).Procedural in style, the film reminds me of ""All The President's Men"", with its dogged and maddening investigation by unofficial individuals. Here, Graysmith's obsession with the case matches the obsession of Woodward and Bernstein. ""Zodiac"" has a big problem with pacing. Suspense is sporadic at best. Too much dialogue, and unnecessary sequences, especially in the film's middle Act, render considerable boredom. Given the film's length, these talky sequences could easily have been edited out.The film's production design and overall acting quality are good. I could have wished for more late 60's era music. ""The Hurdy Gurdy Man"" was good, but not enough. Authentic location shots add credibility to the story as non-fiction. The film's cinematography makes use of the new digital ""Viper"" camera. As such, ""Zodiac"" is significant in that it becomes the first major movie to be filmed without conventional videotape or film.A flabby screenplay interferes with what should have been a riveting thriller. Still, if you are interested in this true life crime case, Fincher's ""Zodiac"" records the lengthy, and futile, search for the infamous killer who still fascinates us, even after all these years. Unless this case is solved quickly, it will soon become a crime legend of historic proportions, every bit as haunting as the legend of Jack the Ripper.",Zodiac
115,sauravjoshi85,And the case still remains unsolved,8,30 March 2020,"Zodiac is a mystery thriller movie directed by David Fincher and stars Jack Gyllenhaal, Mark Ruffalo, Robert Downey Jr., Anthony Edwards, Chloë Sevigny, Brian Cox and John Carroll Lynch in the leads.The movie is based on a book by Robert Graysmith played by Jack Gyllenhaal about an unsolved serial murder in late 60s and early 70s.The best part of the movie is it's accuracy about the murder, it's depiction and creating the real locations.The acting is good specially by Jack Gyllenhaal and Mark Ruffalo. Robert Downey Jr. could've been utilised much better.Screenplay is slow but somewhat the same is required to take out the authenticity of the subject. David Fincher is known for murder mysteries and he again proves with this movie.As mentioned earlier that some section of viewers can dislike the movie due to it's pace as murder mysteries are generally fast paced but slow screenplay was required.Overall a slow but nice movie.",Zodiac
116,NateWatchesCoolMovies,An unnerving masterpiece,10,18 July 2016,"David Fincher's Zodiac is the finest film he has ever brought us, and one of the most gut churning documentations of a serial killer's crimes ever put on celluloid. Fincher has no interest in fitting his narrative into the Hollywood box or sifting through the details of the real life crimes to remove anything that doesn't follow established formula. He plumbs the vast case files and sticks rigidly to detail, clinging to ambiguity the whole way through and welcoming the eerie lack of resolution we arrive at with open arms. That kind of diligence to true life events is far more scary than any generic, assembly line plot turns twisted into stale shape by the writer (and studio breathing down their neck, no doubt). No, Fincher sticks to the chilling details religiously, starkly recreating every revelation in the Zodiac killer case with the kind of patience and second nature style of direction that leads to huge atmospheric payoff and a hovering sense of unease that continues to make the film as effective today as the day it was released. A massive troupe of actors are employed to portray the various cops, journalists, victims and pursuers involved with the killer during the 1970's in San Francisco, the film unfolding in episodic form and giving each performer their due, right down to the juicy cameos and bit parts. Jake Gyllenhaal plays Rob Graysmith, a news reporter who becomes intrigued and eventually obsessed with the cryptic puzzles which the Zodiac taunts the bay area with by sending them in to the paper. Mark Ruffalo is Charlie Toschi, dogged police investigator who is consumed by the hunt. The third leg of the acting tripod is Robert Downey Jr as Paul Avery, another journalist who takes the failure in capturing the killer a little harder than those around him. The film dances eerily along a true crime path populated by many people who veered in and out of the killers path including talk show host Melvin Belli (a sly Brian Cox) , another intrepid cop (Anthony Edwards), his superior officer (Dermot Mulroney) and so many more. For such an expansive and complicated story it's all rather easy to keep track if, mainly thanks to Fincher's hypnotic and very concise direction, grabbing you like a noose, tightening and then letting you go just when you feel like you have some answers. While most of the film examines the analytical nature of the investigation, there are a few scenes which focus on the killings themselves and let me tell you they are some of the most hair raising stuff you will ever see. The horror comes from the trapped animal look in the victims eyes as they try rationalize the inevitability, with Fincher forcing you to accept the reality of such acts. One sequence set near a riverbank veers into nightmare mode. Every stab is felt by the viewer, every bit of empathy directed to the victims and every ounce of fear felt alongside them. It can't quite be classified as horror outright, but there are scenes that dance circles around the best in the genre, and are the most disturbing things to climb from the crevice of Fincher's work. They're nestled in a patient bog of studious detective work, blind speculation and frustrating herrings, which make them scarier than hell when they do show up out of nowhere. Adding to the already epic cast are Jimmi Simpson, Chloe Sevigny, Elias Koteas, John Carroll Lynch, Donal Logue, Pell James, Philip Baker Hall, John Terry, Zach Grenier and a brief cameo from Clea Duvall. I think the reason the film works so well and stands way above the grasp of so many other thrillers like it is because of its steadfast resolve to tell you exactly what happened, urge you to wonder what the missing pieces might reveal should they ever come to light, and deeply unsettle you with the fear of the undiscovered, something which never fails to ignite both curiosity and dread in us human beings.",Zodiac
117,drownnnsoda,"Captivating, In-Depth Look At The Zodiac Investigation.",10,7 August 2007,"""Zodiac"", based on the book by Robert Graysmith (and also based on the real-life killing spree), centers around the city of San Francisco. Beginning on July 4th, 1969, a young couple are shot to death in their car, the man surviving. This series of random, brutal slayings continues throughout the 1970s, and the daunting killer sends letters and codes to local newspapers and police, calling himself the 'Zodiac'. As murders occur in both Northern and Southern California, the Zodiac has the entire state living in fear. A cartoonist, Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal), slowly becomes obsessed with the case, and devotes his entire life to catching the killer, while his colleagues, Inspector David Toschi (Mark Ruffalo), Paul Avery (Robert Downey Jr.), his wife Melanie (Chloe Sevigny), and others look on.Quite possibly the best crime-thriller I've encountered since ""The Silence of the Lambs"", ""Zodiac"" is a truly amazing motion picture. I was held captive in this film's spell from the grisly opening scene, and couldn't keep away from the screen for the following two and a half hours, so that tells me this movie did something right. Based on the real-life killings, this film is also based upon the book by Robert Graysmith, which chronicled his actual experiences in the Zodiac case, and the film is told through his eyes as well. My knowledge of the actual Zodiac case itself is rather sketchy, and I'm only familiar with some details, but from what I know, this is a very accurate telling of the murders and the investigation, and I was happy with that, because it seems most true-crime films twist, remove, and add things a bit for storytelling purposes. Luckily, this movie works well and is much scarier because it tells things closely to how they happened (and not to mention through the eyes of someone who was involved in the investigation).David Fincher (who is responsible for ""Fight Club"", a favorite of mine, among others) directs this film, and I can't say there is a better choice. His direction is stylish, and the cinematography, like in all his films, is stunning. Great angles, good editing, and some really nicely done insertions of code cipherings in a particular sequence really stand out. This isn't a horror movie, it's a dramatic crime thriller, but the suspense and tension is magnificently mounted and it builds and builds as the movie flows toward its conclusion. It's a rather lengthy film, spanning a little over two and a half hours, but I was surprised at how quickly everything seemed to go by. It felt more like your average hour and forty-five minute movie, so that also tells me that the script is tight and doesn't lose its audience's interest easily. Even the investigation work (which is what the majority of this film consists of) is interesting, which may come as a surprise, because one would probably think that it would be yawn-some, but it's not. I found myself thinking about this movie long after I'd watched it, and the mystique of the entire case and the particular storytelling here is all really intriguing. Not to mention those disturbing and realistic murder sequences featured in the film, which I found to be extremely chilling because of how real they felt. The killer is brought to the screen in a realistic manner in this movie, and he's not some silent, unstoppable force of evil, like some slasher film villain. He has a real, earthly quality about him in this film, and I think for that, his character is even scarier.The cast is amazing here, everyone in this film gave stunning performances. Jake Gyllenhaal leads the cast as our protagonist, and is excellent. He's followed by Mark Ruffalo and Robert Downey Jr., who both turn in solid performances as well (Ruffalo plays the police chief to a T, and Downey Jr. is good for a few laughs, but also seriousness). Chloe Sevigny plays Gyllenhaal's wife, Melanie, and is also very good here, even though she's not introduced until midway through the film. A few others you may recognize include Dermot Mulroney, Phillip Baker Hall (who starred in the 2005 film ""The Zodiac"", about the same topic), Clea DuVall, and James LeGros, all who do great jobs. The film's conclusion leans toward one plausible theory of the Zodiac's identity, but also has a good sense of ambiguity to keep things mysterious. To this day, the Zodiac killer has still never been caught. But, according to Graysmith, the identity of the killer is obvious, judging from his investigation. Overall, ""Zodiac"" is a suspenseful and unsettling crime-thriller that cannot be missed, especially by those who find interest in the Zodiac case, or anyone who has read Graysmith's novel. This is a captivating and shuddering look at the Zodiac killer and the investigation to reveal his identity. This is surely the best film that I have yet to see about these events, the others will simply pale in comparison. Throw in some top-notch direction & cinematography, solid suspense, and great acting, all fastened together by a wonderful script, and you've got what I consider one of the best true-crime suspense thrillers in years. 10/10.",Zodiac

Everyone who watched this film said it was ""amazing thriller"" and if you google best thrillers of all time you will probably get this movie as a result. Why is it called a thriller???

People have no idea what a thriller is they think that a detective/crime/mystery/thriller are one and the same... Even on IMDb page this movie is described as Crime, Drama, Mystery, see? No thriller...
Anyway because I was mislead, I was hoping to see a great thriller as everyone told me, but I was bored to death. To be honest I think this movie would've been much more entertaining as a documentary other than a live-action film. Anyway, giving it one star is obviously unfair, since it's a great mystery film, but as a thriller it's abysmal, so blame the fans for misleading me.

121,3xHCCH,Darkly comic tale of obsession,7,12 June 2007,"I saw Zodiac today. I was deciding between Bordertown and this one, but decided on Zodiac because of the director David Fincher, whose Seven is a classic. I was not disappointed. The atmosphere is really creepy. Just like what jess said, the murders were just the backdrop of the story. The main plot and 2/3's of the film revolves around the men investigating this case, whose lives were drawn into a tangled net by their obsession about solving the case.Jake Gyllenhaal was very good in his role, as a dorkish naive cartoonist, whose family life was rent apart by his obsession with Zodiac. My favorite sequence was when Jake's character visited the cinema owner's eerie house and basement. It was darkly comic, yet without losing its creepy edge and chilling atmosphere. Jake was so effective in that scene!Marc Ruffalo had to deal with a very difficult voice quality and accent, but he was believable. Chloe Sevigny was also quietly effective in her unexpectedly limited role, same with Dermot Mulroney (even dared to show his paunch!).Much praise had been heaped on the performance of Robert Downey, Jr. But honestly, I don't get the love. I felt he actually ruined my appreciation any scene which contained him in with his ambiguous alcoholic character, which he played in a very annoying and hammy manner.

All the actors do great jobs in this one, I'm especially fond of Brian Cox's and Anthony Edwards' performances. The cinematography is quite stunning, the dark, gritty city feels all too real to the audience.Yes, I understand many people's frustration with this movie: it is very long. But to me, this only adds to the experience. This Zodiac killer was loose for years, it is a long and complex story. The longevity of the movie helps us as an audience feel the frustration and confusion, the obsessiveness of Paul Avery and Robert Graysmith as they try to track down this man. It was a lengthy and bewildering time for the San Francisco area and this movie accurately reflects this.This is definitely not a movie I will be constantly revisiting, once a decade is probably good enough for me, but I'm very glad I watched this movie.",Zodiac

124,slokes,Here Comes The Roly-Poly Roly-Poly Man,7,17 October 2009,"An unsolved case doesn't stop director David Fincher from constructing an absorbing and clever puzzle picture around the investigation into the identity of one of northern California's most notorious serial killers, the Zodiac.I don't know who Zodiac was, and I don't think Robert Graysmith does, either, despite the latter's attempt to pin the blame on one suspect. Reading ""Zodiac"" the book was like listening to a potty uncle rant about FDR and Pearl Harbor. Though based on the book, the movie is quite different. Zodiac was known to have killed five people and injured two in 1968 and 1969. Most of the attacks are featured in the film, but despite Fincher's reputation for violent fare, his film is more interested in delivering context than bloodbaths, and the murders are depicted in a non-exploitative way.More time and energy is spent on the whirlpool of suspicion around the case, and how it comes to consume what might be called three other Zodiac victims: Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal), reporter Paul Avery (Robert Downey, Jr.) and investigator David Toschi (Mark Ruffalo).All three actors deliver fine performances, especially Ruffalo. His Toschi is a masterpiece of mellow intensity, as his focus narrows gradually to one suspect he refuses to rule out because of a handwriting sample. As the years go by, Toschi can't let go of Zodiac, even though he knows he should, his career suffering as a result.Downey's not nearly as subtle, but riveting all the same, his Avery a grandiloquent reporter who seems as addicted to the electricity around the case as he is to the various substances that keep him going. His scenes with Graysmith the Eagle Scout cartoonist give the film much of its emotional content, his cynicism (""What do you want out of this...This is good business for everyone but you"") contrasting starkly with Graysmith's gentle naiveté.The texture of ""Zodiac"" keeps me watching the film. It's like ""Mad Men"" meets ""CSI"" with a touch of ""Boogie Nights"" thrown in. Even when you see the film and know where the shocks are, the creepy vibe Fincher sustains is riveting. Also powerful is the soundtrack. I'll never hear Donovan's ""Hurdy Gurdy Man"" the same after how it plays over the opening scene, maybe one of the most intense openers since ""Jaws"".What doesn't keep me watching so much is the plot. Fincher does very well with what he has, to a point. But perhaps because he wants to tell the story in a factual-as-possible way, we get dealt a good deal of blind alleys and red herrings, especially with all of Zodiac's most notorious crimes out of the way less than 30 minutes in. To say ""Zodiac"" doesn't need to be 160 minutes long isn't to deny Fincher makes it interesting. It's just that a half-hour less would have given what's left a stronger focus.Still, it's good to have a film that puts as much attention on look as ""Zodiac"" does, and presents such a fine all-around cast in moments both suspenseful and funny. Anthony Edwards is still a wingman 20 years after ""Top Gun"", this time as Toschi's less emotional partner William Armstrong. Brian Cox is hilariously over-the-top as celebrity attorney Melvin Belli, whom Zodiac apparently phones at one point.""He didn't leave a number,"" Belli adds.""He's kind of crafty that way,"" Armstrong replies.I watched ""Zodiac"" the first time expecting Rob Zombie, and found something closer in spirit to Hitchcock. Pretty good Hitchcock at that. Consistently effective, often brilliant, ""Zodiac"" is a psycho killer film that does less to scare you than to make you care.",Zodiac
125,EUyeshima,Overlong But Still Involving Story of the Pursuit of the Elusive Zodiac Killer,7,5 August 2007,"Even though I was a child, I distinctly recall the news coverage of the Zodiac killer manhunt nearly forty years ago, which served as the inspiration for Clint Eastwood's epochal film, 1971's Dirty Harry. David Fincher's meticulous 2007 film, however, is not a standard action shoot-'em-up. In tone and pacing, it seems to have been inspired by Alan J. Pakula's All the President's Men (1976). Both movies take on the guise of a suspenseful, character-rich detective story that highlights the obsession that takes over the police and the press in uncovering high-profile crimes. Unlike Pakula, however, Fincher does not propel James Vanderbilt's time-spanning script (based on Robert Graysmith's 1986 book, Zodiac) as forcefully and lets the story go on far too long to be consistently compelling, especially as he is forced by facts to leave the resolution open-ended.The story traces three main protagonists over several years - San Francisco police detective Dave Toschi and two of the staff at the San Francisco Chronicle, veteran crime beat reporter Paul Avery and young cartoonist-turned-writer Graysmith. It is ironically Graysmith who is the most tenacious in finding the murderer as the encrypted letters sent to the newspaper offices feed into his natural interest in puzzles. As one would expect from the maker of Se7en and Fight Club, Fincher does not shy away from the details of the graphic killings, but the movie is far more about the frustrating pursuit by the three men separately and together. The cat-and-mouse tension works best albeit most predictably when Toschi and his fellow law enforcement officers are involved. The journalistic pursuit is comparatively less interesting because Avery's self-destructive tendencies and Graysmith's mounting preoccupation do not measure up dramatically to the palpable idea of the killer being caught and punished by the law.Typical of this genre, the performances for the most part are workmanlike. Playing a character that inspired not only Eastwood but Steve Mc Queen's Bullitt, Mark Ruffalo lends his familiar ramshackle persona to the sardonic character of Toschi - more like Columbo than Callahan. As the alcoholic, drug-addled Avery, Robert Downey Jr. shows an obvious affinity to his character, and he makes the most of it, even if it all feels a little too familiar. Jake Gyllenhaal grabs the most screen time and provides an effective portrait of Graysmith as he evolves from naïve and impressionable to haunted and indiscriminately desperate. Smaller roles are filled by Anthony Edwards as Toschi's upstanding partner, Chloë Sevigny as Graysmith's increasingly alienated wife, Brian Cox in a ham-fisted turn as attorney Melvin Belli, and best of all, John Carroll Lynch in a subtle performance as prime suspect Arthur Leigh Allen with only a hint of malevolence.The marathon 156-minute running time helps create an almost mini-series feel to the whole venture, but Fincher's dark, supple film-making style compensates to a great degree. The period detail is evocative without resorting to kitsch or heavy nostalgia, for example, the primitive state of telecommunications is conveyed perfectly in a scene where the various city police departments try to coordinate the sharing of evidence. I happened upon the filming at the San Francisco Chronicle building on the way to work last year since I live just a few blocks away and was able to witness first-hand the meticulous attention to historical detail in the vehicles and the characters' wardrobe. The 2007 DVD is bereft of extras apparently in preparation for a two-disc Special Edition DVD set that will include the commentary tracks and featurettes one would have expected here.",Zodiac
126,fertilecelluloid,"Feels surprisingly like Lustig's ""Maniac"" at times",8,8 March 2007,"""Zodiac"", though an $80 million studio pic, feels a lot like Lustig's ""Maniac"" at times. Even the score echoes Jay Chataway's from that film. The Zodiac Killer is loose in San Francisco and he's boasting about his exploits in the media. A cartoonist, played by Jake Gylenhaal, finds a way to decipher some of the coded communications the killer sends to the media and begins his own investigation into the fiend's identity. There is a suspect, but there's nothing conclusive connecting him to the crimes. Mostly a police procedural, it is also a chilling thriller that manages to build a great deal of suspense and unease. Two stand-out sequences where Zodiac stalks and kills romantic couples are pretty amazing and violent. Almost three hours long and twenty minutes overlong, the director of ""Seven"" and ""Fight Club"" has crafted a solid, unconventional thriller that brilliantly recreates the two decades the Zodiac Killer remained anonymous (to most) and incognito. Well worth catching.",Zodiac
127,MarieGabrielle,A fresh take on the elusive serial killer....,9,3 March 2007,"After having read other critiques, I will concede to the fact it is difficult to find a film encompassing serial killers and their motivations, and come up with a winner. This one is a winner, thanks in part to David Fincher's directorial style, and a stellar cast.Robert Downey Jr., as journalist Avery does steal the show in parts. He becomes entwined in the case. Mark Ruffalo as detective Dave Toschi is excellent. Chloe Sevigny is believable as Graysmith's beleaguered wife, worried for her family and Graysmith's involvement.Jake Gyllenhall does quite well as Robert Graysmith, SF Chronicle cartoonist who eventually becomes intrigued, then obsessed with the case.We do see the reality of police investigation. The gritty, hardly glamorous world of the 70's is perfectly visualized by Fincher. We may remember ""Se7en"", in which Fincher so brilliantly portrayed serial killings in NYC. The visuals convey as much as the dialog. He is a truly gifted director.Overall, there is no gratuitous blood; I felt the scenes were accurate, and reflect the humanity and tragedy, without unnecessary gore. Fincher relies more on visual moods and scene settings; the suspenseful scene in the basement, as Gyllenhall suspects he is in the presence of the killer, is unique and reminiscent of Hitchcock. The dread and suspense is palpable. We do not often see this in this genre of film.Anyone intrigued by this story may also want to read Robert Graysmith's book. Highly recommended. 9/10.",Zodiac
128,aharmas,What a crime!,10,4 March 2007,"Sometimes it's not the end result that is thrilling, but the road there, and through the skillful eye of David Fincher, the investigation of the Zodiac murders is indeed a very twisted and challenging one. Through the obsessive perspective of our main character, the only way to solve this mystery is to dive in, without any concern for personal safety.Little by little, he discovers that there are too many loose ends, and that inexplicably, the police officers are not able to pin down the main suspect. By the end of the film, we still don't quite understand what happened. There is enough tension to expose a few people to danger, particularly our cartoonist/investigator, and to realize that there is more than one party to blame.The film is intriguing because it is an expose of an investigation that didn't work and led to a series of murders that could have been prevented. It is also fascinating because it shows how police departments and newspapers ethics worked in a not so distant era. There are many implications that are touched upon but not developed, and much of the appeal of the film is that it takes us back to Hollywood's golden age in the 70's, a time when directors took their times developing a character, creating an atmosphere, and presenting terrific acting. The cast is excellent, with Raffalo, Gyllenthal, and Soveigny doing superb work, and Downey, Jr. once again shining, with his portrayal of another lost soul.It is hard not to go back and look at the production here, and I certainly hope that the careful work by the entire team is recognized later in the year. This film is remarkable because it proves that anything done with care will result in a quality production. A lot of care went into the cinematography, art direction, costume design, and music score, to bring back an era, and to be as truthful as possible to its source material.Last, but not in anyway least important, is the storyline of this series of murders that terrified a nation, and how smoothly it blends with our contemporary fascination with unnecessary violence in films. The film pulls this off because it has simmered slowly to the point that we really care about what happens to the protagonists. It never relies on cheap jolts and unnecessary bloodshed, but the effect is still a bit voyeuristic, except that this time we really ""know"" how we got to this point. There are a couple of scenes that recall moments in ""Silence of the Lambs"", when the sense of doom becomes oppressive and we can't help wondering if it was all for nothing. We all want a happy ending, and this time, in a very ironic way, we got a real one that leaves with a satisfied look in our faces.",Zodiac
129,Enchorde,Good reality based thriller,7,15 August 2009,"Recap: Based on a true story about a serial killer, calling himself the Zodiac, who played hide and seek with both the police and the newspapers. After an attack where a girl is left dead and a boy critically wounded the murderer reports the attack himself. What's more, he sends three separate cryptos to three different newspapers. He claims that it will reveal his identity, and that he will attack again if it is not published. The newspapers comply but the killings go on, with the police unable to catch him. Eventually the killings stop and the police's interest wane. Only a cartoonist risk everything, obsessed with revealing the identity of the Zodiac.Comments: Based on a true story the flow of the story is a little odd. The killer supposedly vanished for years occasionally and then the move skips time with him. However, that's not really a problem as it is till easy to follow the story and the single events, although maybe months or years apart, feels connected. The story is solid, without major holes to fill in.But, maybe the movie is a little too focused about following the real events. Because when the end comes, it turns out to be a real anti-climax. Maybe this should have been the point to be creative, but that's not the real point of the movie. The movie intends to be true to the story, and it seem to be (I'm not that familiar with the real story). So OK, the ending is not good, I felt a little robbed after the ending, and that's not a good feeling to leave a movie with. But what's really bugging me after, and what should have been either corrected or left out, are a few ideas, or hints, in the movie that is never picked up and explained to satisfaction. One is that Graysmith at one point believes the Zodiac to be two people. Some evidence supports this but that track is left out. Also the main problem with the Zodiac is his identity. But a woman who barely escaped his clutches isn't even questioned by police. Or this incident wasn't really the Zodiac, he claims it wasn't, but if the producers/directors/police doesn't believe it is, why is it in the movie? Either cut it or follow it up.Well, those weak points aside, it is a good thriller. There is suspense in the hidden identity, but is got strong support in the sub plots. The personal life of Graysmith or Avery. Or Toschi's struggles to solve the crime, alone against the stream. They do really add up nicely together. It's a good detective story all the way, well right up to the end.Also it pays to look out for known actors and actresses. Some in really small roles, some in bigger.All in all, I quite enjoyed it, despite it being long.7/10",Zodiac
130,Boyo-2,Wow,9,12 March 2007,"The friend I went to see this with remembers when this case was in the news. I don't remember it at all but I was not much of a news junkie back then. With that in mind, the only thing that kind of spoiled this for me was that after reading all the reviews, I was told that the movie has no closure for the viewer, that the killer was never caught so you might leave it feeling a bit cheated. If the real killer was never caught and the movie is faithful to the actual events, why is this even mentioned? I liked the other David Fincher movies I've seen and this is probably better than all of them, in many ways. Its a careful, detailed telling of this serial killer that terrorized various communities in California for years. He's up to the task and did not glorify the acts or the criminal.After cops David Toschi (Mark Ruffalo) and William Armstrong (Anthony Edwards) investigate this case for years, it goes cold, as it would. Then the cartoonist Jake plays sets his sights on picking up the pieces. He's always been interested in it, but as a cartoonist (not even a reporter!), he's been very limited on what evidence he was privy to. He dedicates himself to it and unearths things that the cops missed. The movie makes the point several times that the police on the case, from a number of different precincts, do not always have their efforts coordinated.Two scenes are very memorable. The first when Toschi, Armstrong and another cop named Jack Mulanax (played by Elias Koteas) interview a man named Arthur Leigh Allen (he is played by John Carroll Lynch, who I enjoyed in ""Fargo"" and ""Volcano"" and ""Bubble Boy"" which starred Jake) at his place of work. The cops 'like' him for the crime and the scene is very well done at creating tension from all the points of view.That's nothing compared to the other great scene. Its near the end and Robert (Jake) is going at the evidence with a vengeance. He interviews a man named Bob Vaughn (played by Charles Fleisher) at this home. This scene is straight out of Alfred Hitchcock..just terrific.Really great movie..don't get turned off by the length of it. It needs that much time because its complex. You will not get bored by the details either. 9/10.",Zodiac
131,Jonny_Numb,"Definitely worth another look, especially if you didn't like it the first time around",8,27 July 2007,"When Canadian Industrial band Skinny Puppy came out with their first album in 8 years, many fans embraced the music, but just as many seasoned veteran listeners greeted it with scorn. The overall complaint was that the band was merely cashing in on the anti-Bush bandwagon (circa 2004); others posited that it did not sound like the band they'd grown up listening to (circa the '80s and '90s). In other words, the group didn't meet expectations because they did something DIFFERENT, as opposed to what was EXPECTED. My conclusion, which also applies to David Fincher's sweeping epic ""Zodiac,"" is: change is inevitable with the passage of timeif you want ""the same old thing,"" go back and listen to it, or watch it, or whatever.That being said, my first viewing of ""Zodiac"" (during its theatrical run) left me feeling almost remarkably disappointed. I had been anticipating the film since I first heard about it (circa 2005), as it was based on one of my favorite true-crime cases, and directed by David Fincher, who had created some of my favorite films. If ever there was an ideal pairing (and Fincher had shown his skill with serial-killer thrillers in the classic ""Se7en""), this would be it. Yet as I sat in the theater, I was almost disappointed in Fincher's own self-administered stylistic restraint as the film went off in the direction of a character study mixed with police procedural. I liked it up until about 90 minutes in, and found the remainder of its 158-minute run time to be labored and unengagingright at the point where the tension should have been rebuilding. That, and I found that Mark Ruffalo and Jake Gyllenhaal, two up-and-comers, didn't possess the necessary chops to see the remainder of ""Zodiac"" through. After a 5 year gap, I was left somewhat bitter at what Fincher had (or hadn't) delivered.And now that I'm typing up a review, fresh off my second viewing (ah, the wonders of DVD!), I have to say my initial impressions have changed radically. (Of course, part of this is me confessing my own pro-Fincher slant.) There is an interesting generational dynamic at work in the ""Zodiac"" reviewsmany of the elder critics who rejected Fincher's previous films have showered the heaviest praise on this one. And it is highly likely to alienate the teens and twentysomethings (myself included) who watched ""Se7en"" at an impressionable age, and celebrate ""Fight Club"" with near-religious fervor. For Fincher, who has built his career on unusual and unsettling projects, ""Zodiac"" is really the closest he has come to ""normality,"" despite the subject matter.I kept thinking that the film would play better on the small screen, and sure enough, it does. Without the distractions often associated with theaters, home viewing becomes ""Zodiac""'s most fitting arena, a safe haven to soak up the volumes of detail present within this lengthy mystery. In addition to the near-relaxed style and sepia tones present, the other audience-limiting factor is the convoluted nature of the caseyes, ""Zodiac"" is a film that demands total concentration on the viewer's part, loaded with dates, places, and characters who pop up sporadically throughout the narrative. Fincher successfully condenses James Vanderbilt's screenplay (based on the book by Robert Graysmith, portrayed by Jake Gyllenhaal in the film) into something coherent, but only if you stay on your toes. ""Zodiac"" is admirably challenging in its effort to turn a mainstream film into a thinking (wo)man's piece.Fully engaged in the story, it's interesting to see Fincher's stylistic touches channeled in a manner contrary to the visual dazzle he's known for. First is the cast: comprised not of marquee names but real faces, actors like Ruffalo and Gyllenhaal (both usually associated with lighter fare) actually leave fitting impressions in remarkably human roles; ditto Anthony Edwards, Elias Koteas, and Donal Logue as policemen from three different jurisdictions. This lack of bankable names is quite daring, and the performances sell the film. Second: the subtle depiction of obsession present is cleverly displayedin any other film, Graysmith's relationship with his wife (Chloe Sevigny) would have been padded out into a subplot, but Fincher makes it a side note to the Zodiac hunt, thus eliminating potentially melodramatic filler. Similarly, Robert Downey Jr. (as SF Chronicle reporter Paul Avery) has an excellent scene (among many excellent scenes), wherein he tells the invigorated Graysmith to forget about the dormant case, something the audience may be agreeing with at that point. Gyllenhaal, who gives the material his best shot, ultimately keeps us anchored in his Everyman pursuit of truth, to a substantial, satisfying payoff (the film's final scene gave me chills).Is ""Zodiac"" the jewel in Fincher's celluloid crown? No. It is, for my taste, a very well-made film that will probably make its way onto my ""Best of 2007"" list and alienate a lot of the director's cult following. But I'll be the first to admit that stepping back and viewing the film as the logical progression of Fincher's diverse career will make it more satisfying and rewarding. If you were left cold by it before, give it another lookit might just surprise you the second time around.7.5 out of 10",Zodiac
132,aidanratesmovies,One of the best Thriller's ever made,10,6 December 2019,"Immensely thrilling, engaging, and by far entertaining, Zodiac makes use of its 2 and a half hour runtime in the best way possible. The film is incredibly gripping, with a sense of direction that makes the audience feel like its not only on edge but that these things are truly happening right in front of you. The script may seem a bit choppy at times, but mainly, it's only because there is simply so much information in the lifetime of a case like this. The performances are brilliant, with Jake Gyllenhaal being the best of the leads, but with the other two leads (Downey and Ruffalo), also making more than a mark. John Carroll Lynch also provides for a good supporting performance, as well as pretty much the denture supporting cast. In the end, David Fincher's Zodiac is not only a one of a kind thriller masterpiece, it's also a film that is bound to stand the test of time.

133,valleyjohn,Fincher plays games with his audience again,9,1 July 2020,"There is no doubting David Fincher is one of the greatest directors of the last 30 years . His attention to detail is astonishing and you almost have to watch his films several times to take everything in .Zodiac is no different .Set in the late 1960s and 1970 , San Francisco is in fear as a serial killer called Zodiac stalks its residents. Investigators and reporters become obsessed with learning the killer's identity and bringing him to justice.Fincher loves to lead the audience down the garden path. Just when you think you know what's happening and who's the culprit is , he throws in a curve ball .Zodiac really makes it's audience work. You feel as frustrated as the detectives and reporters looking for the killer and as Fincher likes to do , the ending isn't all sweetness and light . who can forget Se7en!There are some great performances from Jake Gyllenhaal and Mark Ruffalo but you can't help but think that inspector David Toschi should have had his man locked up if he's have really done his job properly.If you like this , I recommend the Netflix series Manhunter .

136,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of Zodiac,10,17 May 2014,"In the wake of Jake Gyllenhaal's latest crime drama Prisoners (slated for a late September release), I thought I'd revisit one of his best films containing for my money, his best overall performance. Now Gyllenhaal, in anything good or bad, puts his heart and soul into many a role. His performance, much like the movie I'm now reviewing, is a tour de force. Zodiac, also a crime drama, portrays him as political cartoonist turned novelist and would be detective Robert Graysmith. While watching Gyllenhaal on screen, you can see many faceted layers to his acting persona. He dives into the proceedings with a feeling of anxiousness, fear (fear of failure that is), disciplined intensity, and earnestness. The members of the cast that fully accompany him are Mark Ruffalo (plays David Toschi, a proficient police detective with a noticeably high metabolism) and Robert Downey, Jr. (playing a burned out crime reporter who resorts to drugs and alcohol). They also are excellent in their roles and never miss a beat. Other members of the cast that filter in and out include Anthony Edwards, Elias Koteas, and Brian Cox.Being a highly dialogue driven movie, Zodiac brings together a lot of reputable actors to keep the film from being boring and repetitive. Its director, David Fincher, excels at dealing with flicks that involve what I like to call, ""the violence of the mind."" Like in his 1995 hit Se7en, he'd rather show the aftermath and have you think about what you might have saw instead of having actually seen it. Zodiac is similar to Se7en for a portion of the way. However, it does show some murders (only about three with much less gore), doesn't concentrate as much on the killer (leans more toward telling the story of the killer's pursuer, especially in the second half), and it provides a lot more detail/insight contained in its script by James Vanderbilt (he wrote The Rundown and Darkness Falls to name a few). Taking in its absorbing 2 and a half hour running time, you can tell that everyone involved wanted to get every last detail just right. As I have stated in previous reviews, putting a true story out on film means honoring the material as much as possible. After reading the background information about Zodiac and viewing it multiple times, I applaud Fincher and company for churning out this highly detailed, rather exhausting masterpiece.Playing like two different films in one (the first half is 1969 to 1972 and the obviously noted second half is 1976 to 1991) and showcasing a sort of underwhelmingly drab sense of time and place (this is actually very effective), Zodiac depicts true events revolving around the San Francisco Bay Area serial murderer known as well, the ""Zodiac"" killer. From 1969 to 1972, this person is pursued extensively (partly by newspaper reporters and police inspectors) and eventually never brought to justice. Only a few years later does a nobody cartoonist (who is unbelievably infatuated with the case) reopen things on his own. He thereby threatens to wreck his marriage, fracture his health, worsen his family values, and even expose himself to the mysterious killer by going on TV. The reasoning for all this: he just wants to see the ""Zodiac,"" look at him in the face, and know that he found the right person. Another reason: he feels that no one else cares or wants to capture the vigilant (it might make sense because too much time has passed, this person only killed a few people, and in the last 5 years, San Francisco had over 200 murders).As I said earlier, Zodiac is all about detail. The time lines that are shown in small captions at the bottom of the screen state the date, the place, and even the exact time. Then there is the feel of this exercise. It's no doubt Fincher's vision but I was somehow reminded of 1976's All The Presidents Men. It's obvious that both films rely heavily on dialogue. And I guess they both sometimes take place in a newsroom. Are they similar in plot? Not really. But the sense of urgency in both pictures accompanied by the eerie musical score (coming in at rare intervals), made me believe that Finch might have been a little influenced (subconsciously I suppose) by that 1976 Best Picture nominee.Anyway, Zodiac was released in early March of 2007. And although it didn't garner one single Academy Award nomination, I still consider it one of the 5 best films of said year. With keen, meticulous direction and dynamic acting from the leads, this vehicle sweeps you into its superior, linear narrative. It really puts the ""true"" into true story. Next to the similar, yet more gruesome Se7en and his other dialogue driven masterpiece being The Social Network, this is David Fincher's finest hour. Overall, Zodiac is a treasure and a sure ""sign"" of movie greatness.",Zodiac

The movie seems like 2 dull movies wrapped into one movie - (spoiler) first one being the cops trying desperately to adapt to the crazed media-loving killer, and the second one with the Gyllanthal character going on his own sleuth trail. Neither storyline builds any kind of suspense. It's more of a poor docudrama. This was what was happening at the time let's recreate the mystery....and the production seems to do a fair enough job at it. The director may have put in a painstaking amount of time on research, but nothing pulls you in - it's looking at events like reading a Encyclopedia - there's no shades of emotion or interesting character development. The actors all do a satisfactory job, but nothing above average.... So not really recommended at all. Only interesting thing was coincidentally that the settings were all identifiable to my hometown areas.",Zodiac
139,lewiskendell,"Could be a bit shorter, but no other real complaints.",7,15 May 2010,"Out of the countless serial killer thrillers, Zodiac is fairly unique. Both because it's based on a true story, and because one of the primary characters is a civilian. It's not too often that you see a cartoonist doggedly chasing down leads and sleuthing like a hardcore gumshoe.What we have seen before, is a story of obsession over catching a criminal, and the impact it has families and careers. That's Zodiac in a nutshell. And as the actual crime is still an open case, in a lot of ways the film lives and dies by how well it portrays those relationships. Thankfully, I found all that interesting. If I have to nitpick, I'll say that the running time could have been a bit shorter, and Jake Gyllenhal may not have been a perfect fit or his role. He grew on me as the movie went on, but I can think of five people off the top of my head who would have really nailed that character.Anyway, this is a pretty good movie. Don't expect anything like Se7en or The Silence of the Lambs, but it is thrilling and involving in its own way.",Zodiac
140,yoggwork,Strict and professional crime reasoning film,7,23 February 2019,"Strict and professional crime reasoning film, the whole film logic is not obvious omission, the plot loopholes I can only recall one, is the film at the beginning of the deathless juvenile, in the final identification, but when the police caught Leigh, where was he? The result is so realistic and cruel. If there are shortcomings, it should be rhythm and clues. The film is slow and lacks ups and downs. Especially in the first half, the events progressed slowly, the characters were numerous, the clues displayed were complex, and the narrative perspective switched back and forth. After the failure of Leigh's arrest, the plot grew rapidly. The cartoonist was locked in the main view, but he could not fill every pit. Especially if the case has not been solved, it has left too many clues.",Zodiac
141,moviewizguy,Engaging and Intriguing,10,13 October 2007,"A serial killer in the San Francisco Bay Area taunts police with his letters and cryptic messages. We follow the investigators and reporters in this lightly fictionalized account of the true 1970's case as they search for the murderer, becoming obsessed with the case. Based on Robert Graysmith's book, the movie's focus is the lives and careers of the detectives and newspaper people.When there's a movie that is 158 minutes long shown to be a slasher film rather than a detective mystery, people are most likely not going to see it. The trailer looks like it's setting a movie for 16 year olds, who are expecting a slasher but end up hating it because it was something different and the people who loved to see these movies don't watch it because they'll think (when they are watching the trailer), ""Oh, not another slasher movie,"" which is why, I think, Zodiac didn't make a lot of money in the box office.Well, I liked ""Se7en"" a lot and I like David Fincher movies (who doesn't?). It wasn't a surprise that I loved this movie and I will call this one of the best movies of this year, beating Fincher's other detective movie. It's no doubt that this is Fincher's most mature and best work he has conceived, so far.Being a 158 minute movie, I was surprised I didn't find this movie boring. I thought at least one point in the movie, it was going to be slow and a bit too long but it wasn't. Well, maybe it is a bit too long but I was still engaged and intrigued. This thriller isn't very out there with its storytelling but it works by the dialog and tense and suspenseful scenes, which had no music to play in the background.The killing scenes are great, but there aren't many. Like I said, it's not a slasher film. When watching this movie, you'll get pulled inside, like you're, yourself, a detective on this case and that you are trying to solve it, too. I also love the look of the film, being as the movie takes place around 1969-1976, if I remember.No, this film doesn't have car chases. This movie doesn't have shootouts. This movie doesn't trick the audience with the usual ""twist"" ending. This makes the film authentic and not like other movies. The performances in here are subtle, and not really fantastic, which I really do not mind.Zodiac is frightening and suspenseful at times, but the best thing about it is that it alludes and intrigues, the viewer. It doesn't cheat them nor will makes them disappointed. Fans of ""Se7en"", or David Fincher, must see this.",Zodiac

The pace is nice first 30 minutes, but then, all other 2 hours, the film becomes a terrible drag, so moody and so boring. Neither Jake nor Robert save this bore of a film. I lost all interest after the first hour and was only waiting till the end just to know if Zodiac killed anybody else and was he ever caught or not.

Not just the action or thrilling episodes, but also the patient work done by the police and an amateur investigator.You don't smile at the early 70s here. You get involved instead in a non-ironic way, not at least due to the great acting performed by almost everyone. It's reality as a myth, which mostly is more scaring than any fantasy.

145,valadas,Not particularly brilliant,6,24 April 2011,"This was a veridical case so they say. It's more the story of the investigation of several murders done by a psychopath serial killer than a thriller about the murders themselves. After police having given up the investigation and closed the case without getting any solid evidence that would allow them to get to the murderer, a newspaper cartoonist becomes obsessed with the case and starts an investigation on his own account. This is the main feature of the movie sometimes a bit thrilling but most of the time rather dull and monotonous like a not very exciting investigation documentary report.

149,sme_no_densetsu,Above average serial killer movie,8,6 May 2008,"This is the story of the infamous Zodiac serial killer who terrorized California in the late 60's and early 70's. Obviously, since the story is based on real occurrences you may already know how it turns out. Then again, ""Dirty Harry"" was also based on these same events (albeit loosely).Unlike ""Dirty Harry"", though, this is not a one-dimensional cops and robbers (or rather cops and serial killers) flick where the good guys match wits with a dangerous criminal on their way to a decisive outcome. This film is more about criminal elusiveness. Mark Ruffalo's character Dave Toschi is no Harry Callahan clone. He may not like being constrained by due process but we see that in the real world the bad guys aren't always so easily identified.This film is mostly about pursuit rather than confrontation. It drags a little at times in the latter stages of the 158 minute running time but that's not a major detraction. I do think that the script could have used a little tightening, though.The acting is uniformly fine all around, with Gyllenhaal & Ruffalo giving perhaps the best performances. David Fincher's direction is ideally suited to the subject matter and creates an eerie sense of foreboding throughout. Another thing worth noting is the deft use of period-specific music, most notably Donovan's ""Hurdy Gurdy Man"".Overall, the film isn't perfect but it's a definitely better than the run of the mill movies of this type.",Zodiac

Jake Gyllenhal plays the nerdy assistant-type, and he keeps the movie going along.There's nothing too great to report here, but it's one joy ride that will keep you enthralled all the way through.

151,Screen_Blitz,"Expertly crafted and electrified with scorching narrative complexity, Zodiac is a daring examination at the hunt for one of the most notorious serial killers",9,8 October 2017,"The hunt for one of America's most infamous serial killers known as the Zodiac Killer is on, and David Fincher is the man to take the director's chair to bring this true story to sparkling colors. Zodiac is not a film that engages any typical serial killer conventions, it is part-police-procedural, part-mystery; both of which are blend together to generate an electrifying examination at the story following the San Francisco police department and their attempts at hunting down the criminal in a case that was sadly remained unsolved. If you know Fincher, you should expect that he doesn't believe in playing things straightforward. He, along with writer James Vanderbilt who adapts the script from the real-life detective involved Robert Graysmith, crafts the story with frequent narrative conundrums and shocking twists to leave the audience no more or no less puzzled than the lead character and the police detectives involved with the infamous case. With the story sprawling through the 1960s and 1970s, the film follows Robert Graysmith (played by Jake Gyllenhaal), a cartoonist for the San Francisco Chronicle who comes involved with a string of murders perpetrated by an anonymous being known as the Zodiac Killer. With the San Francisco police department in pursuit, Graysmith along his fellow reporter Paul Avery (played by Robert Downey Jr.) cross paths with Detective David Toschi (played by Mark Ruffalo) and William Armstrong (played by Anthony Edwards) as they pitted in a game of cat-and- mouse as the killer ignites an increasing body count and taunts them with encrypted messages that hold secrets the criminal's identity. David Fincher has a thoughtful eye for visual detail, and this powerfully demonstrated by his capture of 1960s (and eventually the 70s) San Francisco. From the vintage automobiles, to the production design, Fincher keeps things realistic as possible. But that is just the beginning of how the director puts his filmmaking pastiche on display, his methodology on taking the true crime story from pages of Robert Graysmith's memoir and bringing it to life is the real deal. Fincher tackles the mystery crime case with wild complexity that defies against conventional storytelling. The former half focuses on the steadily progressive bloodbath woven by the killer's twisted schemes before diving into the anxiety of the lead character and the police department as they are constantly played as puppets of the criminal's cryptic plan, and Fincher never lets his opportunities to breathing sheer suspense into the picture go to waste. With a solid barrage of hair-raising contorts, the man spins the plot into an enigmatic tale that requires us to question everything and drive use to point of throbbing our heads of with bold conspiracies. At the same time, he also builds upon an absorbing character study of the lead character as his increasing obsession with unmasking the killer not only puts a strain on his family but leaves with spun into a conspiracy- thumping craze. And Jake Gyllenhaal puts on a strong performance to weave energy in his role. Robert Downey Jr. and Mark Ruffalo remain solid throughout, but perhaps nothing particularly grand in their cases. The best thing to say about the cast is most of everyone sustains throughout the picture. Zodiac is an expertly crafted mystery picture electrified with scorching narrative complexity and gripping suspense that dares to you guessing at very turn. For a best estimated target demographic, the film will most likely to please viewers who have the patience to withstand David Fincher's trickery for capturing the energy of the plot, especially with a lengthy runtime. For those who lack the patience, they certainly do not know what they are missing.",Zodiac
152,KUAlum26,A Serial-killer movie with no easy answers. Imagine that!,10,6 February 2008,"Re-watching this movie,I was moved to write a review. I'm not sure why I didn't the first time that I saw this,but maybe I was in such awe and disbelief of the product on the first viewing that I felt like I needed a RE-viewing to take it all in again. I'm glad I did.Director David Fincher(""Se7en"",""Fight Club"",""Panic Room"",all VERY good movies IMO)may not seem to be the best choice to helm this true-story accounting of the Zodiac killings,set around the San Francisco Bay Area in the late,late 1960s and early early 1970s,but Fincher's ever-sharp eye for moody,eerie detail is perfect here! Based on the 1981 BEst-seller by SF Chroncile CArtoonist Robert Graysmith(off a script penned by James Vanderbilt),the story picks up off of the SECOND pair of murders that occurred,this time during fourth of JUly weekend 1969 and follows with great attention to detail both the police investigation of the crimes and the press' involvement in coverage,particularly the offices of the San Francicsco Examiner. The central characters sort out to be the Examiner's Crime reporter Paul Avery(Robert Downey Jr.,possessing arguably some of the best lines in the movie),SFPD inspectors David Toschi(Mark Ruffalo,hard-working and sympathetic as ever)and Bill Armstrong(Anthony Edwards,who should be working more) and,of course,Graysmith(JAke Gyllenhaal,perfecting the ""likable social retard"" role he's probably better known for),who proves to have a very sharp eye for solving codes,puzzles,riddles and ciphers. Over the progression of almost two-and-a-half hours of movie time,the investigation shifts focus and the details,minutiae and personalities begin to accumulate,both creating pieces to slowly(try roughly twenty-two years in sum)fit the puzzle,yet always leaving some doubts as to who,how(also how many),why and--in the beginning--when,as the eponymous killer goes from being a taunting sociopath to a desperate attention-grabber. Naturally,as the process becomes bogged in details and due process,the investigation grows colder,where it births as a media sensation as well as a police problem,until it ends up being part of a low-profile,single agenda obsession for the cartoonist Graysmith. By the end of the movie,the facts presented--and I choose to be INTENTIONALLY vague here--make this as potentially frustrating for the viewer as it was for those,police and otherwise who tried to solve it.Editing,lighting(EXCELLENT use of color schemes to show the sort of dingy,kitchy look of the early seventies),score(by David Shire),pacing,as well as fine performances by the principles(and some lower-billed roles too,notably Chloe Sevigny as Graysmith's patience-exhausted girlfriend/wife,Dermont Mulroney as Toschi and Armstrong's superior,John Carroll Lynch as the chief suspect and Charles Fleischer as a potential ""person of interest"")make this movie one of the more quiet gems to pas through theaters in 2007. If I understand correctly--and I haven't COMPLETELY pored over the Oscar noms yet--this show didn't get ANY nods,which is a true head-scratcher. In the movies,just about all serial killer flicks have some sort of visceral release or denouement(heck,""Dirty HArry""for which was mostly inspired BY the actual Zodiac case,practically is made as a surrogate for the real-life case,and does just that--provides the closure!),but leave it to a detail-driven film based on a real baffler to provide something unique and well-worth the film-viewer's time and money.",Zodiac
153,pyrocitor,Anatomy of an investigation,7,4 June 2007,"Given the fact that the story of the Zodiac killer, who left taunting notes in codes and cyphers bragging about his recent kills to the local papers, seemed already like a movie plot brought to life, (several existing films, most famously 1971's Dirty Harry already took inspiration from the real life events) a film adaptation of the tale seemed inevitable. Audiences can be thankful then, that the story was snapped up by the more than capable director David Fincher, himself no stranger to serial killer films after 1995's brilliant Se7en, who blissfully resists the temptation to morph the story into an uninspired, turgid teen slasher film, and instead present the tale as it actually transpired - as an engrossing crime drama. Zodiac looks and feels like a throwback to such 70s political detective stories as All the President's Men, and it is unquestionably refreshing to see a movie detailing a serial killer which is not afraid to allow its audience to think for a change. There is no question that director Fincher has done an abundance of research on his chosen topic, it's Fincher's reverence to his subject matter is both what makes the film a triumph, and yet proves its downfall all at the same time. While the details of the case are admittably fascinating, (though the supposedly objective portrayal of the case does feel rather biased at times, and it's clear who Graysmith, the author of the novel the film adapts, fingered as the real killer) and the film kicks off at a brisk pace, ensnaring the audience's attention right off the bat, it appears Fincher and screenwriter James Vanderbilt have worked perhaps too hard to incorporate every last trace of information regarding the case. While for the first half of the film, it becomes increasingly difficult to pry one's eyes from the screen, once the case moves to the point when the killing spree was long finished, the question is posed as to whether it was essential to the storyline to show every last potential lead to the case. From this point on, the film starts to drag, losing both its momentum and the audience's interest. In the end, for however much energy and factual interest Fincher can squeeze out of his film, it is still a 158 minute movie which the audience knows is going to end in an anti-climax, (anyone following the case in the news knows that the killer's real identity was never discovered) which after a while makes the audience wonder if every ominous piece of foreshadowing is really necessary. A bit of judicious editing, whittling down the talky bits, would make the film feel more streamlined, tense and far more effective. The fact that Fincher's project feels a touch fact bloated at times, especially in the middle section is a shame indeed, for when the film is good, it is a rousing success. The dramatic confrontation scenes crackle with sheer intensity, and the criminal investigation for the most part (especially during the film's beginning and end) is tense and engaging. Fincher also perfectly captures the feel for the period; the 1970s clothing, bustling newspaper offices complete with typewriters and liberal facial hair on most of the male cast members seem to throw the viewer back thirty years flawlessly. The film's score by David Shire also proves highly effective, both at amplifying the tension and dramatic punch of the confrontations with the killer, and helping bring the slower scenes to life more. Overall, the film's strong points still stand out fiercely over the slower bits, and it just feels like a shame whenever the film drags and starts to become uninteresting, since the stronger sections were so intensely engaging it feels almost unjust to begin to lose interest. The film's cast also helps the material rise from a more standard ""based on a true story"" serial killer drama to a more realistic and captivating take. Jake Gyllenhaal certainly fits the profile of the earnest young cartoonist who finds himself drawn in by the elusive killer's case, and overall he gives a strong performance though at times his character comes across as a poorly written device to advance the plot, which is irritating to say the least. Mark Ruffalo solidly inhabits the role of the weary inspector Toschi; his laid back charisma perfectly complimenting the character while avoiding the stereotype of the burnt out cop. The perfectly cast Robert Downey Jr. walks away with the show with an energetic and poignant performance as Paul Avery, the charismatic journalist whose life is slowly consumed by the unsolved case. Character actor Brian Cox also makes a welcome appearance as specialist Melvin Belli, and he shines in his brief scenes. Overall, Zodiac succeeds to such a great degree in so many aspects, it is unfortunate to see the more engaging elements of the plot weighed down by so many plot points which feel repetitive and unnecessary. The period feel is immaculate, and Fincher proves his mastery at creating tension more successfully than almost any other director still making films, but overall Zodiac feels like a far greater film struggling to emerge from a padded out simply acceptable film. The film still merits watching for its many successes, but be prepared to invest enough time, thought and interest to fully appreciate the film as a whole.-7/10",Zodiac

To compare this movie to David Fincger's previous work! I am not going to! A director doesn't have to be limited on working on the same genre over and over again! To be absolutely clear ""Zodiac"" isn't a thriller! It is much like an American take on a English crime drama! And if you just look a bit further than you will see that it is about obsession! It is not about finding out who the Zodiac killer is but it is about the people who are involved that try to do so! That doesn't mean that this movie is not thrilling! It is to a certain degree! You get sucked in by the main characters. We want them to be successful! But in the end it just points out what can happen to (for the most part) ordinary people who get obsessed for some reason! Overall ""Zodiac"" is quite intriguing and interesting! But it won't be for everyone!

155,Maciste_Brother,Not a single memorable moment in the whole thing!,4,28 January 2008,"ZODIAC has achieved what few films of its stature have ever achieved: during its long 158 minutes running time, there isn't one single memorable scene that comes to mind. Not one! I honestly cannot understand how this could be possible. The film has an excellent cast and a more than competent director so how come I cannot remember anything from it after just seeing it last week? It's not bad per se but still, how was it possible for such a big production to have not a single great moment? It's mind boggling.The only thing I remember is the blah color scheme, the inaccurate wardrobe and the awful digital photography and FX. Because of the digital photography and lighting, some scenes where so processed or slick that they ended up looking like they were created with a computer. And speaking of CGI, practically all of the scenes taking place inside cars where obviously shot in a studio, with the background being keyed-in badly. This usually wouldn't be a big problem with most films but ZODIAC has several scenes which take place inside a car and the bad FX were extremely distracting. I've seen less fake looking car background shots in a Doris Day/Rock Hudson film than this.The film's quasi-obsessive (read: anal retentive) attention to details about the Zodiac case should not be mistaken as greatness.

158,bobsgrock,Contains the spirit of Graysmith's obsession.,10,28 February 2008,"Some might say David Fincher is an obsessive film director. He is notorious for doing dozens of takes for specific scenes, often frustrating actors and crew. He is also one of the most innovative and methodically successful directors in recent memory. Following similar material used in his previous sinister masterpiece Seven, Fincher takes his skills to the mostly real world by portraying the infamous Zodiac Killer of the late 1960s and early 1970s that paralyzed the San Francisco area and eventually the United States.There are many theories and myths surrounding the Zodiac Killer and especially the author who has given perhaps the most detailed and complete account of the multiple incidents. The character of Robert Graysmith, played with charming angst by the remarkably chirpy Jake Gyllenhaal, is the main focus of the investigation team as he went on to write two books on the killings. However, Fincher wisely spreads his net wider, also including the head investigator (Mark Ruffalo) and a key journalist who was contacted by the Zodiac (an incredible Robert Downey Jr.) All the acting is quite wonderful, especially Downey as a drunken and paranoid man driven to loss by the case. All of them succeed best in portraying obsession, the main theme of this film.Obsession has been a trademark of David Fincher films, be it attempting to kill a terrifying alien, a serial killer using the seven deadly sins as his MO or trying to revolutionize humanity through revitalized masculinity. Never is this more fully realized or better handled than in this film, which makes a strong case of being Fincher's best. It is so methodical, so professionally paced that despite its long running time it is never boring; every scene is necessary to create a plethora of characters that are individuals as well. It is remarkable to see Fincher subvert his own genre clichés here as we never get the various scenes you would expect in a serial killer film. Thus, you are constantly guessing.With obsession being the main target, we witness its consequences on the investigators and their personal lives. Often it is unpleasant and yet refuses to go away. The film ends best it can: ambiguously. Zodiac remains a mystery, one that will continue to boggle minds and challenge notions. Yet, despite whatever flaws Graysmith's research may have, he has done an incredible sacrifice of willingly giving up a huge portion of his life to better understand this horrific incident. For unknown reasons, he persevered at remarkable costs. Never have I seen a film that embraces its protagonist's spirit so well. Fincher does so here.",Zodiac
159,areatw,Fascinating and successfully chilling,8,9 December 2017,"'Zodiac' is a compelling and very well-made film focusing on an amateur detective's investigation into the infamous Zodiac killer, whose identity remains a mystery to this day. It is rare for a factual crime film to go into such detail about events that took place in real life, but 'Zodiac' ensures that all of the key points of this case are covered. As a result, the film is nearly three hours long, but every scene serves a purpose and the running time is never felt.The graphic scenes of murder at the very start of the film do a good job at setting the scene, throwing the audience right into the case and creating a tense atmosphere from the get go. The tension rarely lets up, with the pacing of the film ensuring that there's always a new plot development around the corner. The acting is also very good, with Jake Gyllenhaal delivering the stand out performance and probably a career best from him. An excellent film all round, highly recommended for those who enjoy true crime stories.",Zodiac
160,Philby-3,"Smart Killer, dumb cops",8,14 June 2007,"In this part of the world ""Zodiac"" conjures up memories of the old Ford model Dad drove in the 1950s, but in the Bay area of San Francisco, it is still a name to send a shiver down your spine. The Zodiac was a serial killer of the 1960s and 1970s who specialised in attacking courting couples and sending cryptic (and not so cryptic) notes to the local newspapers. He was never caught, despite two of his victims surviving to identify suspects and despite a mountain of circumstantial evidence against one particular suspect, Arthur Leigh Allen.This film, based on Robert Graysmith's books, is a combination of the police procedural with newsroom drama a la ""All the President's Men"". The police efforts to find the killer, led by Detective Toschi (an excellent Mark Ruffalo) are complemented firstly by the San Francisco Chronicle's Paul Meyer (Robert Downey, cast yet again as a talented drunk) and then by the paper's cartoonist, Robert Graysmith, who becomes more and more obsessed by the case. Graysmith, also excellently played by Jake Gyllenhaal, eventually persuades Toschi to re-examine the evidence. As the tagline rightly has it, the film is about the effect the Zodiac had on his pursuers as well as on the crimes and the investigation. Chasing the Zodiac was not a great career move for Toschi, Meyer and Graysmith. Nor was it good for Meyer's health or Graysmith's personal life. But the main focus is on the hunt, and it's a long and tangled tale. The police were almost unbelievably incompetent, though this is rather soft-pedalled in the film. For further reading on this see the chapter ""This is the Zodiac Speaking"" in Richard Belfield's ""Can You Crack the Enigma Code"" (2006).However it is made clear in the film that the several police forces involved routinely kept pertinent information to themselves instead of sharing it. Graysmith comes up with a prime suspect, Allen (spookily played by John Carroll Lynch), From the little I know about this case, the director has exercised some dramatic licence  this is drama rather than documentary. Thus, while it's true that a suburban couple were able to crack the Zodiac's cryptogram where the FBI and CIA failed, some of the Zodiac's later coded messages were never cracked. Graysmith's visit to the hardware store to confront Allen didn't occur. What did happen, according to Belfield, was that an FBI agent in the mid-1970s brought one of the surviving victims, Bryan Hartnell, to surreptitiously identify Allen as the killer at the hardware store he worked at. Another survivor, Mike Mageau, identified Allen from photographs in 1992, but as you will see from the text at the film's end the police had run out of time.This film is well acted and nicely photographed, but, like the real investigation, long and meandering, with several story lines becoming dead ends. If I were Governor Schwarzenegger I'd have an enquiry into the California police forces  there's clearly a major public administration problem there. I sometimes despair of the proficiency of the large and fairly professional NSW police force, but having a whole lot of little bailiwicks which don't talk to each other is ridiculous.",Zodiac
161,vithiet,Great detective story based on true facts,7,17 February 2019,"The regular movie is already long and I just watched the extended Director's Cut... that's definitely not for everybody. For a serial killer themed movie, the murders are not at the center; rather, everything revolves around the investigation from cops and journalists. It is slow-paced and feels closer to real life so some people might find it boring. But Fincher once again manages to make it interesting from beginning to end.",Zodiac
162,gedikreverdi,A bunch of racially biased and incompetent cops cannot see what's already in plain sight,8,5 March 2021,"The cinematography was excellent. I felt like I went back in time to those years. I just wished Roberts was the detective responsible for the zodiac case because he, as a cartoonist at the San Francisco Chronicle, is a lot more competent than all of the cops combined. He went after all the evidence that leads directly to the zodiac killer even if it means to sacrifice his marriage. The moment when he went down into the basement with the cinema guy in his house was the creepiest moment throughout the film. He said he wrote those on the posters not his coworker at the cinema. He visited the woman whose sister was murdered by the zodiac told it was Leigh the name of the creepy guy who showed up at his sister's painting party while he'd live in his mother's basement two blocks away from her house. The only guy who saw the zodiac and managed to survive the multiple gunshots unlike his girlfriend spotted Arthur Leigh among the other guys on a paper saying it was him who shot her on that day in the car. After that the police after decades felt like doing something but it was too late because this serial killer had already died of a heart attack. His boots, his height and weight, his watch and the zodiac symbol on his watch and calling himself by that nickname already as one of his friends testified and a child molester but the police needed more evidence against him because a drunk specialist said his handwriting isn't the same as the zodiac's.",Zodiac
163,ElijahCSkuggs,The Main Maniac: The Zodiac,8,3 March 2007,"Going into Zodiac I was somewhat aware of who the Zodiac killer was, but I knew nothing about what type of investigation was put forth. I knew that the Zodiac killer was never caught, but I didn't know the killer teased the media and police with notes and phone calls. Actually, I thought the Zodiac killer was never even close to being captured. This movie also sheds a new light on this. The movie brings you deep into the world of investigating and brings you back to the days where you were afraid to go outside, or even let your kids go to school on the bus. Led by Fincher's directing and followed by the professional acting of probably a dozen known actors, the movie's runtime of two and a half hours barely feels like it....unless, you have achey knees or no butt muscles. :) I just need to give a shout to John Carroll Lynch from The Drew Carey Show, he plays his role incredibly well, 100% believable and inspired. If you're into crime/mystery/serial killer movies, or if you're looking for some more information on the Zodiac Killer and the investigation, look no further. 8 outta 10",Zodiac
164,jaredmobarak,I am not AveryZodiac,8,29 March 2007,"As much a real life story film as one can be, Zodiac goes through the years chronicling the hunt for the serial killer that got away. There isn't the graphic gore quality we've become accustomed to with Seven and Fight Club, but instead a taut thriller that keeps the viewer on edge, not knowing what bit of history would be coming at them next. Usually this type of film bores me, especially being one I know going in that the killer is never caught, yet Fincher really has control of the pacing and delivers one of the fastest three hour movies I've seen in awhile.Our main entry point into the story lies with cartoonist Robert Graysmith, the man whose books the film was based on, played perfectly by Jake Gyllenhaal. No one plays shy, boyish charm, naïveté like he does. What would seem strange casting for a man who ends up devoting his life to finding out who the Zodiac was, Gyllenhaal ends up being the only choice you can think of once we find that Graysmith's nickname, behind his back, is ""retard."" He truly portrays the socially awkward, outcast Boy Scout we need to follow. Only a guy with his likability and lack of ego could get as many people involved in the case to help him find the material he needed.Besides Gyllenhaal though, we have a stellar supporting cast. Every frame that passes brings us another cameo from a known actor. Sure comedies of late have been cameo vehicles, but this one seems to have had Hollywood knocking on Fincher's door to be included. From non- existent parts by Adam Goldberg, and recognizable faces Tom Verica and Jimmi Simpson, to small roles from Dermot Mulroney, Elias Koteas, and Brian Cox, we have a non-stop who's who of acting talent. Fincher must have been a big ""24"" fan as well casting Paul Schulze in a real bad wig as a witness for the cops' main suspect in the case, Arthur Leigh Allen, (played with scene-stealing ability by John Carroll Lynch). There are a couple nice meaty roles to go with the cameos led by the always fantastic Robert Downey Jr. It has been stated the Downey and Fincher butted heads a bit during filmingI mean this is Mr. Unpredictable Ad-lib working for Mr. Perfectionist shooting 25 takes of a one minute scenebut the result is great. Downey brings a comic relief that is needed amongst the violence and drama, yet also plays his descent into drugs and unreliability to perfection. In the end, the real star of the film, in my opinion, becomes Mark Ruffalo. He plays Inspector David Toschi who truly becomes embedded into the case and never able to break free of it. Ruffalo can always play the regular guy in irregular situations without making it seem like acting. His reactions to Downey's character's misstep in info leaking are real, as is his passion and emotion during the course of secretly working with Graysmith during the last act of the film. Toschi is the man that I feel the audience can relate to most during the manhunt and I wish he had been given more of a central role to the movie. Although the film is successful at telling the story of forty years of the Zodiac, the plethora of characters cause it to be a bit sprawling and unfocused. Graysmith wrote the story, and he is our lead, yet we lose him for a good hour of the film to follow the police/newspaper's efforts at finding the killer's identity. Sure Gyllenhaal is in the background often, but sometimes you wonder where he went and once you get comfortable with Ruffalo being in charge, back comes Jake to take the lead again. It almost feels like two films cut together as a whole. Not to say the editing is bad because in actuality the film is real smooth transitionally. We are given snippets that are pertinent to the eventually findings by Graysmith and Toschi, and never more than necessary. When it comes to movies on a strict timeline, this is one of the best.I feel that Fincher could have had another masterpiece, but just couldn't commit to one viewpoint. He definitely did his research into the case and jam packed details wherever he could. However, the tagline for the film is ""There's more than one way to lose your life to a killer"" and yet it was never really taken to the next level. Sure we see the strain the case has on Ruffalo, Gyllenhaal, and Anthony Edward's family life, but on second thought, do we really? Edward's family is never shown and he eventually quits the case, Ruffalo's wife is supporting to the fullest and he remains balanced for perpetuity; even Gyllenhaal's Graysmith, so deep into his research that his family leaves him, never seems too upset about it. He is more, ""I'll take care of our problems once this is done,"" and doesn't really seem to care that he has been left. So, basically in effect, rather than a character piece on how the case effects those involved, we get a strict thriller on the hunt for a killer. Yes, it is not Fincher's best, but as a film it is effective. We get some nice flourishes with the camera (the opening pan with stationary camera through car window, overhead/bird's eye following of cars, and a gorgeous sequence traveling over the fog engulfed bridge of the poster) and some great acting, just nothing really special, screaming out at us to see its importance. Also, where was the Fincher-staple creative credit sequence? All in all Zodiac ends up being an enjoyable ride, that, if nothing else, whets your appetite for more darkness to come from his singular mind.",Zodiac
165,classicalsteve,The Stranger Urban Americans Fear: A Killer Playing the Most Dangerous Game,10,3 April 2007,"The era in which Zodiac takes place bridges two eras in urban America. The Zodiac appeared on the tail end of a crime-spree that rampaged across the US in the late 1960's. His settling in the SF Bay Area may be one of a number of social phenomenons that pushed America's view of itself out of an innocent 1950's sensibility and into a harder and darker view that became more prevalent starting in the 1970's and into the 1980's. People, even in urban areas, used to be far more trusting of one another, friendly, and civil. Many of the events of the 1960's gave urban Americans a much more cynical and cautious attitude toward people they didn't know. Don't trust or talk to strangers. Better to sacrifice helpfulness than to wind up dead. People are out to take advantage. At least in urban areas nowadays, it seems, people are much less willing to take the risk to meeting someone they don't know, largely out of fear.The film Zodiac chronicles the strange unknowable and faceless figure that emerged as a serial killer in Northern California in the late 1960's and early 1970's. He sent letters to the San Francisco Chronicle and other newspapers, outlining his last and future kills, and he revealed he was inspired by the 1930's cult classic ""The Most Dangerous Game"". The point of view is largely from the side of the press with a character from SF Homicide that is also tracking the case. One character, Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal) is an SF Chronicle cartoonist who at first takes an amateur's interest in the case, often bothering fellow beat journalist Paul Avery, played brilliantly by Robert Downey Jr. Only later does the cartoonist engage on his own investigation to reveal the identity of the Zodiac. When Graysmith begins receiving anonymous phone calls with nothing but heavy breathing, you can't help but wonder if he's also playing the same game, and if he may also become one of the hunted.One of the most brilliant aspects of the film is its pacing. It never lets up and the suspense is always there, which becomes unsettling when you realize that these events actually took place instead of purely in the imagination of a modern suspense novelist. There is an eeriness which pervades the entire film. A car stopping unexpectedly in a nearly-deserted area is more frightening than most scenes in your average low-budget slasher flicks.I do have a couple of shortcomings to this film. There are a couple of scenes where the cruelty and brutality of the violence is such that not all viewers will be able to handle this movie. I found I did have to turn away at a couple of scenes. Also, there are a couple of moments when the state of the investigation is not made clear. However, even given these shortcoming, Zodiac is a brilliant movie that tackles a subject-matter that probably could not have been brought to the screen during the period it depicts.The Zodiac came to personify one of the constant fears of living in urban America: a faceless, emotionless killer that comes out of the shadows of a dark alley to commit heinous violence. In the end, we fear strangers because of this, but we end up sacrificing love. It is an ironic aspect of human nature that people can do to strangers what would be almost unthinkable to do to people that we know. In addition to the poor innocent people that were brutally murdered, the Zodiac committed another crime against humanity. He compromised our sense of trust, civility, and in many ways, love for our fellow human beings even when we might not know them.",Zodiac
166,hall895,"Great cast, great drama, great movie",8,4 May 2009,"One of the most famous serial killer mysteries of all time gets the big-budget Hollywood treatment. And director David Fincher does a magnificent job in bringing this fascinating story to the screen. From its shocking, bloody beginning all the way to its conclusion more than two and a half hours later this film has an energy to it which never wanes. There are a few genuine frights sprinkled throughout but this is no typical serial killer slasher flick. The Zodiac killer does all of his bloody work very early on in the film. From there the tension and drama comes from the chase, as a wide array of characters become involved in the quest to uncover this killer's identity. The killer himself remains in the shadows, the film is really about those who pursued him. But it is not only the police who are on the hunt. A newspaper reporter and, of all things, a political cartoonist find themselves swept up in the unfolding drama.Robert Graysmith is the San Francisco Chronicle cartoonist and the story unfolds mostly from his perspective. Young and initially rather naive nobody takes Graysmith particularly seriously at first. But his dogged determination, which segues into complete obsession, pays off as he is able to piece together key parts of the Zodiac puzzle. Along for the journey is Chronicle reporter Paul Avery, a man who has his own personal demons. His efforts to solve the case will eventually be undermined by his inability to remain sober but for much of the film Graysmith and Avery make an unusual but reasonably effective investigative team. Of course there are a great many characters on the police end of the investigation as well. Chief among them are San Francisco police detectives David Toschi and William Armstrong. The toll the Zodiac investigation takes on these men will be obvious. Unlike the newspapermen, for Toschi and Armstrong this case was their responsibility, their life. And the frustrations are understandably sometimes too much to bear.There are so many important characters here and a marvelous casting job is what, more than anything else, allows the film to really come together. Every actor, in roles large and small, falls into their roles perfectly. The central role of Graysmith goes to Jake Gyllenhaal and he does a wonderful job in portraying this character's evolution from a young, inexperienced nobody to a strong, confident, determined figure. If you could not take this character seriously, the movie inevitably would fail. Gyllenhaal ensures that will not be a concern. Robert Downey Jr. portrays Avery and in a film which sometimes needs a lighter touch he provides that until his character begins his decline. As the lead investigators, Toschi and Armstrong, Mark Ruffalo and Anthony Edwards are both excellent. The case obviously had a profound effect on the lives of these two men and Ruffalo and Edwards do great work in showing the impact the Zodiac had on the men who pursued him. The four actors mentioned here had the largest roles but there are so many other fine performances throughout. Cops, reporters, victims, family members and even a suspect or two...so many roles to play and everyone in the cast performed beautifully.As the director, Fincher does a magnificent job guiding his terrific cast through the film's long journey. It is a story with many twists and turns. Leads are pursued, suspects come and go, it's a maze of information but you never feel lost while watching the film. And Fincher has created a tremendous atmosphere in which to tell his story. Locations, music, wardrobe...everything about the film has the perfect feel of late 1960s/early 1970s San Francisco. This story unfolds in a very specific and very unique time and place in history and Fincher has done a magnificent job of capturing that. Even at over two and a half hours long the film never drags. There is great drama and tension throughout and some truly chilling moments along the way. Having an undeniably fascinating story to work with Fincher crafted a truly fascinating film.",Zodiac
167,sharky_55,I am not the Zodiac.,9,10 November 2015,"The basement scene is the most talked about of the entire film, and rightfully. At first viewing I was entranced, and yet a little disappointed when it eventuated for nothing, because then it feels like a cheap way to drum up tension for the sake of it. But as I revisited it it made more sense - the overarching theme of Zodiac is not about the killer so much as it is about Graysmith losing his mind over the case, and here he is creating his own red herring out of his paranoia and fears. Which creates a few other problems. It is a fine scene of course; like the lake stabbings, there is zero non-diegetic sound so the tension is carried predominately by Gyllenhaal's heavy breathing and the sinister whistle of the kettle upstairs, suggesting an accomplice. Upon re-watching it is almost too cinematic to be true compared to the rest of the film; when the supposed Zodiac pulls the string to drown out the only light-bulb and usher in complete darkness, it veers into something a script would stress and a movie be built around. But it works. The problem is that is creates an entirely new subplot where Graysmith's mind goes and this is not entirely justified. We have to be told that his marriage is collapsing, that the shallow relationship with Sevigny is at it's breaking point. Gyllenhaal's performance is very straight forward.This is an entirely minor issue because Zodiac is by all means fantastic. Fincher heavily leans on the reality of the Zodiac case, consulting at length with real life victims, police files and other sources in order to capture exactly how it happened. This isn't seductive or decadent or grimy like Se7en; there are no crisp shallow focus guns pointing right at us within a rainy back alley. There is no high speed chase through the crumbling buildings. The soundtrack is period accurate and ushers in the passing of time, yet the most potent moments are without that backing track. The aforementioned basement scene, and of course the stabbings at the lake. Fincher shot on the exact same day and made sure of every detail in his replica, although the grass and trees are withered yellow (like so many of the other scenes that are applied a tint) as the masked man slithers into view, and death and decay races through my mind. There is nothing to mask the brutal sounds of knife entering skin again and again. A story about Mila Pfefferberg, a Holocaust survivor shivering at the sigh of Ralph Fiennes as Amon Goeth comes to mind. I am sure that Bryan Hartnell feels the same way when he watches this scene. It is predominately shot on digital, but looks every bit from the late 60s. As a man in a yellow-cab taxi is killed, a guitar riff strikes in as the Zodiac killer stalks away. There is a great series of scenes, cross-cut, where numerous police departments attempt to find headway on the case but run into several technical difficulties and barriers that would be unheard of today. We are immersed from the get-go. A camera is placed atop a letter trolley, and we visit every room in the aged yellow newspaper offices accompanied by a Santana psychedelic instrumental made famous at the 1969 Woodstock. Marvin Gaye's soulful Inner City Blues serenades a period of years as the Transamerica is constructed. Montages are plentiful; flurries of inserts as Graysmith photographs the puzzle for his own memento, extreme close-ups that rapidly scan case files that are then chucked into an irrelevant pile, superimposed newspaper titles and TV broadcasts indicating that time has passed, but the Zodiac is still at large, and Graysmith's frustration grows. A cartoonist makes it his lifelong purpose, while Avery (playing impeccably by Downey Jr.) sees the scoop in it, drumming up publicity and questioning the killer's sexuality. A third investigator, Ruffalo's Toschi, is also consumed, although even he does not pursue it as diligently as our main character.Fincher goes a step further by focusing on one suspect, Arthur Leigh Allen. He breaks his supposed objectiveness in his shooting in one interrogation scene as three detectives visit Allen at work. We observe impartially at first, as they go through the usual pleasantries and questions, until Allen makes the mistake of crossing his legs, and we get a low angle shot that distinctly highlights the size of the boots and the detective's brief glance of this. At the mention of bloody knives (oh so perfectly casual from Lynch), the shot-reverse-shot becomes scarily intimate, and from Allen's POV the detectives are suddenly intrigued, staring right down his eyes, and when we cut, they are not looking at Allen, but at a close-up of the Zodiac watch he absent-mindedly thumbs. And in the penultimate scene, a tense climatic confrontation that in another film would be an action chase sequence, Allen stares down Graysmith, knowing what he knows, but also taking comfort in the fact that he cannot do anything about it. This film is more about a cartoonist's obsession with a serial killer than the serial killer himself, but it is nevertheless exciting. There is occasional indulgence from Fincher (think the bird's eye tracking of the taxi) but all in all it is not so hard to be lured in much like Graysmith becomes lured by the Zodiac killer.",Zodiac
168,MrGKB,Not quite as strong as I had heard....,7,14 February 2008,"...""Zodiac"" nonetheless serves as an interesting examination of the effects of obsession on individuals, most particularly upon the man from whose book James ""Spider-Man 4"" Vanderbilt's screenplay was adapted. That man, Robert Graysmith, a newspaper cartoonist with a peripheral interest in the case (rubbing shoulders as he did with journalists directly involved), eventually became preoccupied with identifying the notorious ""Zodiac killer,"" a California nutjob who killed seemingly at random and then tormented the populace with confessional braggadocio via letters to various newspapers, and to law enforcement officials as well.All in all, David ""Alien 3"" Fincher's decidedly unstylish film strikes me as a big-screen Movie of the Week, packing little of the emotional punch of ""Se7en"" or ""Fight Club"" or ""Panic Room,"" his three most accomplished works to date. Whatever cat-and-mouse tension is generated in Act One while the killer is going about his dark business is soon dissipated when his rampage peters out and the story zeroes in on Graysmith's obsessive pursuit and its effect on his personal life. When Graysmith finally confronts his boogeyman, it comes as only mild satisfaction; the viewer is left wondering, ""Okay, now what?"" Unfortunately, that question is rendered moot; the man fingered by the film as the killer died before the law could bring him to justice.Still, ""Zodiac"" is quite watchable. The acting features competent portrayals by the likes of Jake ""Brokeback Mountain"" Gyllenhaal as the determined cartoonist/investigator, Robert ""Chaplin"" Downey, Jr. as a journalist laid low by the events, Mark ""Just Like Heaven"" Ruffalo as one of the lead police investigators stymied by the case, and John Carroll ""Fargo"" Lynch as a wonderfully creepy suspect in the case. Numerous other ""name"" actors fill out the cast, but ""Zodiac"" really isn't about the acting. In fact, in some ways, I found the profusion of identifiable faces to be somewhat distracting; the film may well have played better without them, ala ""United 93."" A perfect example would be Chloë ""Trees Lounge"" Sevigny as Graysmith's wife, a thankless role at best, and hardly one that stretched her acting chops one iota.Regardless, everyone acquits themselves well, and the production vales are top notch, including Harris ""American Gangster"" Savides' digital cinematography, Angus ""Panic Room"" Wall's careful editing, and composer David ""Norma Rae"" Shire's relatively unmanipulative score. The soundtrack of pop songs is evocative and appropriate without being too cutesy.Unfortunately, the sum of the parts is somehow less than the whole, and ""Zodiac"" offers little in the way of repeat viewability, which is why I can only give it a ""7."" Its attention to detail may be of interest to fans of crime procedurals, but even the intricacies of the journey cannot mask the disappointment of the arrival at journey's end.",Zodiac
169,one9eighty,There's more than one way to lose your life to a killer,6,14 September 2020,"This 2007 David Fincher film is based on Robert Graysmith's book which was adapted for screen by James Vanderbilt. Graysmith was a cartoonist working for the San Francisco Chronicle Newspaper at the time of the Zodiac murders in the late 1960's, early 1970's. Officially the Zodiac killer was never identified and caught by Police and to this day remains a mystery. While working at the Chronicle, Graysmith became fascinated with the case, and even after the Police gave up trying to find out who the serial killer was, he was hooked in the hunt. Graysmith eventually went on to write a book about the subject, detailing his experience and the evidence he found. The book is the subject for this film.Starring Jake Gyllenhaal stars as Robert Graysmith. There are quite a few other big names in the film; Mark Ruffalo and Anthony Edwards play two of the main police inspectors, Robert Downey Jr. and Brian Cox work at the newspaper, with Downey Jr. playing Paul Avery who took the lead on writing about Zodiac. Also, in the cast are actors like John Terry, Chloe Sevigny, Donal Logue, and John Carroll Lynch - all of whom give great turns in their roles.This is not your average Hollywood serial killer/ cop film. With it being based on fact Fincher tries to concentrate on what is known rather than what makes an exciting scene for the audience. So, you will not find typical high intensity action; no car chases scenes using typical San Francisco roads, no shoot outs between good guy and bad guy. There are only really two, maybe three scenes in the movie which show events from the killer's point of view. Usually this is a standard trope of such films so the audience can create a connection to the characters, even if it to recognise that the audience are watching the 'bad guy'. This film does not do that, when the killer is present you do not see their face. The closest you get it when potential suspects are shown later in the film. The film is more a character driven film, showing how people who were involved (particularly Downey Jr, - the reporter, Gyllenhaal - a cartoonist/ obsessive, and Ruffalo - the lead investigator) in the story handle it. The events and investigation wore some people down, some turned to drink and drugs, some people became highly motivated, some frustrated - everyone who was touched by the happenings surrounding Zodiac were affected in some way or another, even none central players who just happened to be living in the city lived a life of fear for a period of time, which came across in the film. For this reason, the movie tag line gets it spot on, suggesting ""There's more than one way to lose your life to a killer.""With a runtime of 157 minutes this is a very long film. Bearing in mind that its a character driven and development film there are times where those 157 minutes seem to be dragging on a bit with lots of dialogue. This could perhaps have been cut down a little, but from what I have read, Fincher already cut parts out and was not happy about doing that. This was rated 15 on it is UK release, but short of a small bit of bloodshed and death, its mainly the suggestion of violence that serves to give it that rating. The acting is superb, and with great cinematography and a gritty score this is a good film. Do not expect a happy ending because of course this is a film based on fact, and the killer was never identified. What you can expect is a very long but well-polished, tense, and thrilling character driven film which remains engaging enough to entertain and covers some of the key facts unearthed throughout the investigation.",Zodiac
170,educallejero,"Probably ""too realistic"" for its own good",6,19 September 2019,"The characters are all ""too mundane"". Even the obsessed character (often overacted) is quite bland (not Jake Gyllenhaal's fault, because he's awesome), let alone the incredible amount of police officers and detectives that we came across through the movie.All the performers look bored except Mark Ruffalo (clearly the heart and soul of the film). And even he gets axed for the conclusion in the third act (almost all Jake). I don't understand why Robert Downey Jr. was cast for this. He was pathetic. I didn't believe for a second he was a journalist. Not even a bad one. And he barely matters anyway.In the end, the movie is sterile. Almost like a mediocre documentary that can't create a narrative, this movie jumps so much trough time without giving the characters screentime to reflect and suffer the consequences of an unresolved case, that (probably intentionally) doesn't allow the viewer to feel anything for anybody. The movie wants you to focus on the minutia of the police work and that gets old.",Zodiac
171,tim-764-291856,Excellent - as a straightforward crime drama,8,25 January 2013,"For those who like their complex crime dramas, then David Fincher's 'Zodiac' is hard to beat. If you're after a dazzingly stylised Fincher flick along the lines of Fight Club, you are going to be SO disappointed.Whilst Spike Lee's 'Summer Of Sam', which uses the backdrop of the real- life case of the 'Zodiac's murderous spree in 1970's San Francisco, to concentrate on various characters and is therefore a drama, Fincher goes for straightforward but extremely detailed and painstaking good old police work.The trump card is the solid casting, necessary as the 150 mins duration might have become less than riveting otherwise, with a central triangle involving excellent performances from Robert Downey Jnr, Jake Gyllenhaal and Mark Ruffalo. Downey is an interestingly flamboyant reporter and Gyllenhaal a cartoonist at a newspaper that first receives cryptic messages, from the killer, whilst Ruffalo plays the police inspector involved in the case.The disturbed letters taunt and confuse and the cartoonist thinks he sees a way of decoding them. You could say that the meat to the mostly veg of the film are the brief but very violent actual murders - nothing that shocking or different, at least these days but do give an indication that this was a brutal and disturbed sociopathic serial killer at work.You might feel cheated that even at the end, the case remains unsolved - this is no 'spoiler', it's fact and instead of leaving one unsatisfied, it almost adds to the intrigue and a eerie sense of unease.The period feel is spot-on and some of the music's good and whilst it certainly won't sit with everybody, anyone who enjoys a psychological profile, this is superb, safe in the knowledge that at least this one had not been made up and whilst Zodiac was released some 12 years after Fincher's own ground-breaking and classic 'Se7en', you can see the same mind expertly working both scenarios.",Zodiac
172,Stampsfightclub,Good performances in good but not great crime thriller,7,3 June 2008,"Jake Gyllenhaal (Donnie Darko) stars as cartoonist Robert Graysmith, a man who gets himself wrapped up, along with many others, in the horrendous happenings of a serial killer, a killer who calls himself Zodiac.Based on a true story in the late 60's and 70's, David Fincher (Fight Club) delivers a tense and intriguing plot revolving around a cartoonist, a journalist and many police offices, in which lies an interesting and sentimental ideology.Gyllenhaal's cartoonist is quiet and sophisticated, Downey's journalist is clever and aware and Ruffalo's detective is demanding and hurting, and these characters and different personalities give the plot depth and a good foundation.From the first excellent opening sequence involving the first murder I knew it was going to be an intense watch. The first half of the film is excellent in justifying the mystery and crime genre with the killer being kept well in the shadows and no one not knowing much about it.Having never actually heard about the real killer in real life, I found it interesting to see how this film went about portraying a real life murderer and was very gripping. However, as the film carries on the intensity wears away and instead focuses more upon the lives of the cartoonist, the journalist and the detective, which is fair enough, but I would have personally liked to see a more intense and gripping second half.I found the ending quite poor. I know it is based on a true story and everything but still perhaps the ending could have been shot differently to give the film that extra edge.The performances are excellent. Gyllenhaal was a bit quieter than his better roles in Brokeback Mountain and Donnie Darko but Downey and Ruffalo are on top form in their respective roles.The direction and settings are great as is the first half of the film. However as the film hits the half way point the interest and intensity die away as the film becomes less realistic and almost irrelevant but regardless, it is still a good crime drama.",Zodiac
173,rockman182,Zodiac,9,16 October 2014,"People will point to Se7en or Panic Room as David Fincher's best work, but I like to think Zodiac is his magnum opus. I'm fascinated with the Zodiac killer, and the string of terror he brought in his time. Its riveting, and I think the film portrays many of the real life events very accurately. Fincher's other films are great, but none encompass the spectrum that Zodiac does. Zodiac works as a period piece, police drama, a newspaper drama (if that's even a subdivision), and a thriller. I need to get around to reading Robert Graymsith's book. Feel like the film kind of flew under the radar in 2007, it unfortunately bombed in the box office and I think it deserved at least a Best Picture/Director nod at the Oscars. Its a long film but completely engrossing, which can't be said for every lengthy film these days.",Zodiac

175,Holt344,"Zodiac Director's Cut is a masterpiece, beautifully shot and a must watch for true crime fans",10,12 February 2021,"Zodiac is directed by David Fincher and written by James Vanderbilt, the screenplay is based on the 1986 non-fiction book of the same name by Robert Graysmith.
The film tells the story of the manhunt for the Zodiac Killer, a serial killer who terrorized the San Francisco Bay Area during the late 1960s and early 1970s, taunting police with letters and ciphers mailed to newspapers. The case remains one of the United States' most infamous unsolved crimes. The producers spent 18 months conducting their own investigation and research into the Zodiac murders, which made the film authentic and more realistic as it should be with a topic like this one.
Phenomenal direction from David Fincher, his need for perfection was needed for this film as every single detail is there and it's realistic, rewarding as you appreciate the professional way they went into making this film.The main cast is three well known and acclaimed actors. Jake Gyllenhaal as Robert Graysmith, Mark Ruffalo as Dave Toschi and Robert Downey Jr as Paul Avery. The characters is real and are portrayed perfectly, Mark Ruffalo spoke with the real Dave Toschi and brought justice to his life story, getting the mannerism and behavior right. Jake Gyllenhaal did the same amount of work, interviewed Robert Graysmith to get all the mannerism and behavior down to do a perfect portrayal. This is probably one of Jake Gyllenhaal's best performances, he really does a great job and goes full into character.
The supporting cast has the likes of Anthony Edwards as Bill Armstrong and Brian Cox as Melvin Belli, there's a ton of other actors who each gives fantastic performances.Last time I watched Zodiac was with the theatrical cut, now years later I'm watching the director's cut and it was worth buying the blu-ray for that reason and all the special features that came with it. The changes only minor but it's how the director wanted it to be watched, you could easily watch the theatrical cut and find it as enjoyable, even calling it a masterpiece. The director's cut is only 5 minutes longer but those scenes will make you love the film even more. I strongly believe it is David Fincher's Magnum Opus, every single part of the film is superb, a mesmerizing cinematic experience. I know his passion project was Mank but Zodiac is better in every aspect, that's my opinion.The editing was perfect, Angus Wall did a remarkable job. The film's pacing fits well with the genre and to the movie, to be honest I would say this story would be better told as a TV Series as there's so much to cover but David Fincher succeeds with this 180 minute movie, nicely done to him and the team he worked with. They picked the most important parts of the investigation, a large amount of screen time is the investigation, but there's also character development throughout the film, some of the development is subtle.Harris Savides served as the cinematographer for the film, and the movie looks incredible, beautifully shot.
They captured the 60's and 70's perfectly with its sets, hair/makeup and costume department. Everything looks amazing, hugely thanks to its spectacular production design.This is possibly one of the best true crime films out there. It isn't about Zodiac, but about the people who investigated him. Journalists, detectives and the person who wrote the book that the film is based upon Robert Graysmith.
This film is a must watch, Zodiac is a masterpiece, and a movie I will continue going back to.",Zodiac
176,jluis1984,Haunting,8,12 June 2007,"Among the many cases of serial killers that have become part of popular culture over the years, the case of the Zodiac killer is probably the most intriguing and fascinating of the modern era due to fact that, like the infamous British killer, Jack the Ripper, the Zodiac was never caught and his identity remains a mystery to this day. Operating in Northern California, the Zodiac Killer terrorized the region in the late 60s and early 70s, murdering at least 5 people (although he claimed there were more) during the decade. However, what made the Zodiac so intriguing was the fact that he began to send a series of taunting letters to the press and the police, challenging them and including cryptograms with hidden messages. Almost 40 years later, the case caught the interest of scriptwriter James Vanderbilt and director David Fincher, who fascinated by Robert Graysmith's book about the case, decided to adapt it to the big screen.""Zodiac"" is a careful reconstruction of the Zodiac killer case, following the members of the press and the police whom got involved through course of the investigation. After attacking Darlene Ferrin ( Ciara Hughes) and Mike Mageau (Lee Norris) at Vallejo, the Zodiac sends his first letter to the local police and three newspapers where he claims responsibility over the crime. At the San Francisco Chronicle, journalist Paul Avery (Robert Downey Jr.) becomes the top crime reporter on the case, while at the same time cartoonist Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal) takes an interest on the cryptograms sent by the killer. Graysmith's interest will take him from aiding Avery in his work to actively investigating the case on his own by following Inspector Dave Toschi (Mark Ruffalo). However, his work on the Zodiac killer will begin to take its toll on his own homely life. And the crimes continue.Written by James Vanderbilt, the movie follows very closely the detailed accounts of the case as they appear in Robert Graysmith's book and police reports. Due to this extreme care for realism, ""Zodiac"" is more a police procedural film than a typical movie about serial killers, as in this film the story focuses on those who are following the criminal instead of on the victims or the criminal himself. As the crime never had a proper ""conclusion"", Vanderbilt wisely makes his story not only about the puzzle itself, but also adds touches about the dramatic consequences of obsessing over an impossible to solve mystery. While long and intricate, the development of the story is remarkably good in its narrative, as the slow way clues are unveiled helps to keep the suspense rising and makes the plot captivating and never boring.While Vanderbilt is truly responsible for a lot of the film's narrative structure, it was Fincher who decided to take a realistic approach in their conception of the film, and this can also be seen in the visual aspect of the movie. With extreme and meticulous care and Harris Savides' excellent cinematography, Fincher recreates not only the look of early 70s California, but also the tense atmosphere of paranoia and distrust that the Zodiac killer created among the population during his reign of terror. As written above, the storyline moves slowly, but Fincher successfully manages to keep a good pace while also presenting all the facts of the case. Finally, while this is not an action packed movie, Fincher creates a series of extremely effective scenes of suspense, where thanks to a subtle use of atmosphere and mood, he brings back the real horrors of the Zodiac killer.The acting is another of the film's strong points, as even when there wasn't a serious exploration of the characters (the film was more about how the case affected them), the cast was simply outstanding in their roles. The always effective Robert Downey Jr. makes an excellent job as reporter Paul Avery, and even adds touches of dark humor that makes Avery look more human. However, the highlight of the film is Mark Ruffalo, who as Inspector David Toschi, delivers his best performance so far and proves his worth as an actor. While at times overshadowed by both Downey and Ruffalo, Jake Gyllenhaal remains effective and makes a good job as cartoonist Robert Graysmith. ""Zodiac"" is also benefited by the excellent performances of the supporting cast, which includes Chloë Sevigny, Elias Koteas, Anthony Edwards, and John Carroll Lynch making a haunting performance as Arthur Leigh Allen.Probably the film's worst enemy will be the misconceptions created by its marketing team, as this is definitely not the typical movie about serial killers, ""Zodiac"" is a movie about the terror the Zodiac spawned and the consequences it had in a group of people. Audiences expecting a flashy horror movie like Fincher's previous film, ""Se7en"", will be sorely disappointed, ""Zodiac"" is definitely a different kind of beast. The long runtime and slow pace the movie has will definitely be another of the elements that may cause some discomfort; although as written above, Fincher managed to keep the movie moving with a good rhythm. Finally, some may also be disappointed by the way the plot reaches its conclusion, but given the fact that the case remains unsolved, it was truly the best way to do it without compromising historical accuracy.Perfectly crafted thanks to a solid work of writing and directing, ""Zodiac"" is definitely one of director David Fincher's best films. It is a movie that reveals him as a mature director and proves that the promise he showed in ""Se7en"" and ""Fight Club"" wasn't a case of luck. It may be too early too tell by now, but in my opinion, ""Zodiac"" will go on history as one of the finest police procedural films ever made. 8/10",Zodiac
177,cchase,Chilling Account Of America's Ultimate Serial Killer/Stalker...And The Men Who Stalked HIM...,9,5 December 2008,"JULY 4th, 1969The late Sixties kicked off a time of tremendous social upheaval and cultural change, not to mention the political turmoil being fueled by our continuing involvement in Vietnam. For the most part, though, in the idyllic town of Vallejo, California, the people seemed mostly untouched by all the chaos swirling around in the rest of the country.Until this night.On a deserted lover's lane, a young couple is brutally gunned down, shot multiple times by an unknown assailant. The male half of the couple somehow manages to survive the ordeal. His girlfriend is not so fortunate.And that's how the story of ZODIAC begins.Having seen an earlier, low-budget version of the story that clocked in at just under ninety minutes, I couldn't figure out how in the hell director David Fincher was going to hold my attention for TWO AND A HALF HOURS. Without a new and different way of telling the story, I pretty much anticipated ditching this one early, regardless of who was in it. And this rendition brings out the big guns: Jake Gyllenhaal, Robert Downey Jr., Mark Ruffalo, Chloe Sevigny, Elias Koteas, Brian Cox, Philip Baker Hallthe list is impressive.Well, as it turns out, so is the movie. Told with that matter-of-factness that we've come to expect and enjoy from police procedurals like CSI and LAW AND ORDER on the small screen, ZODIAC goes a whole lot deeper than those shows, to give us better insight into both the kind of man who would commit such ghastly, murderous acts, and more importantly, the kind of men obsessed enough to want to catch him at literally any cost. Based on the book by author Robert Graysmith, it's Gyllenhaal who actually plays him in the movie; a squeaky-clean editorial cartoonist working for the San Francisco 'Chronicle' in 1969 when the story breaks. He's like a kid with his nose pressed to the window of a neighborhood bar, where all the grown-ups go; he wants to be as important and respected and hip as the guys who write the ""big"" stories, but he can never gain the access to that world he craves. That's only until he meets crime reporter Paul Avery (Downey Jr.), who is as perplexed and intrigued by the Zodiac Killer's taunting letters and weird, cryptic ciphers which he demands the local papers publish to avoid more deaths on the streets. He's not quite as taken with the socially inept and naïve Graysmithuntil he finds out that Robert is a puzzle aficionado whose infatuation with them gives him the aptitude to help crack Zodiac's messagesand maybe provide some badly needed insight into the killer himself.Unwittingly intertwined with the destinies of the two newspaper flacks is the investigating officer, Inspector David Toschi (Ruffalo) and his partner, William Armstrong (ER's Anthony Edwards.) The animal-cracker addicted cop attacks the case much like an animal  a bloodhound  as he sniffs out every clue obsessively, probing, questioning, eventually winding up living, breathing and sleeping the case like someone who lost a family member to it. I can't recall the last time I saw a crime drama that so widely covers all angles of a true event  maybe Richard Brooks' masterpiece IN COLD BLOOD, the granddaddy of true crime thrillers, or Richard Fleischer's riveting THE BOSTON STRANGLER. Yes, the required reenactments of the crimes themselves are played out here, complete with the kind of gory detail that defies you to watch and dares you to look away. But like those other two movies, it makes the story of how the case energizes, engulfs and even destroys the lives of the men driven to find the answers to solve it, where ZODIAC distinguishes itself from any other film of its kind. It's also a great look at the low-tech procedures that the police were limited to compared to today - how sometimes, jurisdictional problems and bureaucratic red-tape (not to mention jealously guarded turf and other issues) sometimes prevented investigators from getting out of each other's way (or their own) long enough to do an effective job.Everyone here is in top form, from the principals right down to the cameos that only amount to a few minutes of time on-screen. But where Fincher really shines is in the scenes that will stand out in your mind forever when you think about the case or this movie. For me, one scene in the third act, which features a gripping performance by Charles Fleischer (A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET and WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT), is a chilling, nerve-jangling sequence that captures the creepy essence of the entire film. I won't say too much about it here, but I can guarantee that you'll be on the edge of the couch when you see it.Not really a horror film (but definitely not a horrible one), ZODIAC enriches David Fincher's past body of work, and makes a great companion piece to his other classic crime thriller, SE7EN.",Zodiac
178,agmoldham,Is this really worth of the Top 250?,5,13 June 2007,"I saw this film recently without seeing any critical reviews or any vibe on here. Bearing in mind some of Fincher's previous work I was a bit disappointed with the film. I was somewhat surprised therefore to see it sitting proudly in the Top 250.The film follows the real life case of the serial killer labelled Zodiac who terrorised the San Fancisco area with a series of murders in the age of flower power. The main focus on the film is the investigation of the murders and I found the thick end of 3 hours a bit on the long side. Anyway it's clearly the case that lots of people enjoyed the film, so you'll need to check it out yourselves. I'll be watching it again when it's on TV to see if there's more to the film than I saw on my first viewing.",Zodiac
179,Danusha_Goska,"Smart and Stylish, BUT All Trees, No Forest",7,4 March 2007,"""Zodiac"" is one of the smartest and best produced movies in theaters right now. ""Zodiac""'s stars are terrifically talented men at the top of their games.Bonus: The script is full of unexpected witticisms that will make you laugh out loud.For all that, ""Zodiac"" lacks a center, and it lacks a point, which is a shame, because the point was right there, shouting at the filmmaker, who maybe just didn't realize it. ""Zodiac"" is all trees, no forest. It could have been a great movie; as it is, it is very good.First, what ""Zodiac"" does right: The production values are sky high. The film painstakingly recreates late 60s early 70s San Francisco.Jake Gyllenhaal, Mark Ruffalo, and Robert Downey Jr. are the very excellent big names in a cast that is, from top to bottom, first rate. Everyone here is simply wonderful, wonderful. Brian Cox is delicious and unforgettable as Melvin Belli. Robert Downey Jr. is seductive and painful as a drug- and alcohol-addicted, showboating reporter. Mark Ruffalo is very sexy as a tough cop.Each is given his pithy scene, his signature idiosyncrasy. Ruffalo eats animal crackers; Gyllenhaal is an Eagle Scout who drinks ""aqua velva""s, Downey lives on a houseboat.Everyone is so darn good you'll wish at least *one* of these very excellent performers had been given enough screen time to develop a character of some depth, and to move a coherent plot and theme forward.And there's the rub. There is no main character here. It isn't Gyllenhaal, whose do-nothing presence is simply awkward in his early scenes. You think, ""Why is Jake Gyllenhaal even in this scene? He's doing absolutely nothing..."" and then, forty minutes before this long movie ends, Gyllenhaal suddenly becomes the protagonist of a movie that feels very different from the first portion.That there is no real main character highlights another problem with the film. It has no point.Each individual scene is excellent. Each individual performance is excellent. There is a suspense scene: ""Are you sure we are alone in the house?"" There is a slasher scene - knife, stabbing, blood. There is a ""clueless chick in a dangerous situation"" scene. There are newsroom scenes and police headquarters scenes and ""judge denies warrant"" scenes. None of this adds up to any main idea, though.And that's too bad. The main idea was shouting and waving at the filmmaker: Zodiac craved publicity. He demanded that his letters be published in the newspaper. He killed for publicity. Did the newspapers that published him, gaining circulation and profits thereby, cause innocent human beings to die? By extension, do filmmakers like David Fincher, in making films like this, that make serial killers out to be glamorous and powerful, play any role in the loss of human lives? Serial killers tend to be losers and schlubs. they get away with what they do, to the extent that they do, not because of any great intelligence they possess; they aren't smarter than those of us who don't kill. They get away with what they do because of blind chance. They don't deserve to be made out to be larger than life.Fincher could have used the heavy artillery at his disposal: fantastic stars, a terrific script, intriguing real life events, to have given this film some weight, some gravitas, some center, some trajectory, that it currently lacks, had he explored these questions, questions inherent in the material itself -- a killer who demands the front page, and who promises he will kill if he does not get it.",Zodiac

181,sjanders-86430,David Fincher directs with a unique touch,10,1 February 2021,"Jake Gyllenhaal plays the lead in this 2007 docu drama about the late 60's San Francisco serial murderer who called himself Zodiac. The film opens with a couple parked in a parking lot talking. A car pulls up, drives away, then returns and parks behind them so they can't escape. The man walks to the passenger side and shoots both of them with a 9 millimeter. The date is July 5th,1969. They are adjacent to Columbus Highway, Vallejo, California. Letters from Zodiac with long codes attached arrive at the San Francisco Chronicle where Robert Graysmith is a cartoonist. Paul Avery is lead reporter on the Chronicle staff played by Robert Downey Jr.
The lead cop on the case, Dave Toschi, is played by Mark Ruffalo.
The case has never been solved. The handwriting of Graysmith's choice of prime suspect never matched the letters. His book is such a waste of paper, because Lee Allyn is not the Zodiac. His evidence is unsubstantiated. True crime writers have undermined American justice for years. Dominick Dunne is another true crime writer who caused more harm than good. They should stay out of crime solving and the influencing of lay people.
At least Fincher captures Graysmith's obsessive behavior that ruined his marriage. If you read Graysmith's books, you will understand that he targets a fall guy and then works his books around that. Dunne did the same thing.
Gyllenhaal is perfectly cast as the cartoonist turned true crime writer. He plays Graysmith like the Eagle scout who is obsessed with earning his next most important badge: crime solver.
The best performance goes to Robert Downey Jr. as Paul Avery.
This film is worth watching so that true crime writers will be exposed as total frauds.",Zodiac
182,jpschapira,Personally...,8,20 August 2007,"I feel like my whole life had passed in front of my eyes in two hours and a half. Many movies cover many years of the lives of their characters (""The Shawshank redemption"" is a perfect example that comes to mind), but few do it so vividly as David Fincher's ""Zodiac""; the story of a serial killer who haunted the police and the press for thirty years. If you need to know, the case hasn't been solved yet.What happens in ""Zodiac"" is that: a lot of years. Some of the characters really seem like they've aged with the dates we see on screen and some look the same, but we stop caring at one point because we're completely involved in the story. I wouldn't say that the movie moves fast, but it definitely moves strong; it is, as ""Letters From Iwo Jima"", a piece of instant impact and a director's piece in every aspect.If you've seen a David Fincher film before, you can expect to be confused; so don't complain if ""Zodiac"" is a bit messy and hard to follow; but it's not ""The Game"" or ""Fight Club"". Those two films also shocked me just after watching them, but I don't totally recall them today. Maybe ""Zodiac"" is Fincher's movie that will stick with me the most; maybe it is his masterpiece, and if you haven't seen any of his films, it's a good place to start.It would be fair to say that it is the development of the case what is hard to keep up with, but fortunately that's just one thing of the diversity ""Zodiac"" has to offer. In fact, it's one of the beauties of the film that the 'investigation' is not everything. Fincher knows we've seen to many mystery movies where the case is the focus and where the viewer has to work hard to figure it out (""The Usual Suspects"" is a perfect example that comes to mind), so he speeds up the process giving a lot of changing but easy to understand resolutions.I know it's contradictoryIt's a disorganized process with simple answers, but it's the director's choice; and we forgive him because he provides so much more. ""Zodiac"" is not just the story of a murder being solved; it's a character piece of the most unusual nature. It's not just about cops and reporters doing their jobs; it's about working men bored with the routine, longing for excitement and about working men frustrated because they can't succeed at the only thing they do.The first of these explanations refers to two of the main characters: Paul Avery (a flawless Robert Downey Jr.); a reporter with a lot of guts and a fondness for alcohol, and Robert Graysmith (a not so convincing Jake Gyllenhaal, at least after having seen him in ""Jarhead""-if you like the guy you must see that film-); a cartoonist who wrote the best-selling book in which the film is based. The latter explanation applies to Bill Armstrong (Anthony Edwards) and Dave Toschi (the great Mark Ruffalo: phenomenal); two cops devoted to the case and unable to crack it.Talking Awards (I know Matias likes that), this is not the film of the year; but it's the kind of film that due to its nature, could get a Best Ensemble nomination for the SAG Award: besides the leads it has Chloe Sevigny, Brian Cox, Phillip Baker Hall, Dermot Mulroney, Donal Logue, Clea DuVall, Adam Goldberg...Not bad. And maybe Adapted Screenplay somewhere; don't know.Personally, I believe this is one of those pieces where the director is crucial; and I would be glad to see an Oscar nomination 'a la' David Lynch with ""Mulholland Dr.""; because I think David Fincher should have had one by now But that's just my opinion.",Zodiac
183,Maziun,Searching for killer,7,31 December 2013,"Searching for the killer is like searching for the meaning of live – hard job with uncertain resultsMany viewers complain about the length , but I think I understand what the writer and director were trying to accomplish . You see the search for Zodiac took years. The movie tries to capture that feeling of passing time and that's one of the reason for the movie being so long. The very detailed investigation is the most interesting aspect of the movie . It's hard not compare ""Zodiac"" to ""Se7en"" . The latter is obviously superior. In ""Se7en"" you can feel the presence of killer everywhere and he both scary and mysterious. Here we know that he is somewhere out there and that he is killing people , but he isn't even half fascinating like John Doe. ""Se7en"" also was happening in one town , which felt and looked ugly , was a character of it's own and had a very claustrophobic feel about it. Here the killer seems to be working in whole country , which makes the movie less scary. We have three heroes here – Jake Gyllenhal , Robert Downey Jr. and Mark Ruffalo. The movie keeps switching from them and it's hard to connect emotionally for the viewer with one of them . It also doesn't help that Gyllenhal (who probably has the most screen time of them all) is very bland , a true boy scout indeed . Downey Jr. is better , but he gives another ""I'm a blasé jester"" performance (which works for Iron man) . The best performance here comes from the underrated Ruffalo , who gives a subtle portrayal of mild mannered man tired of the constant chase.The movie has some thrilling moments , but it's more of a drama . It's a story about people who lived in the shadow of Zodiac, who by chasing him somehow gave a meaning to their life. ""Zodiac"" doesn't end like a movie , it ends like a real life – nothing is resolved for sure. I see this as a tribute to the people who are trying hard to catch a criminal , protect the people , work in the shadows and rarely (if at all) have any reward from the faith or society. Is it worth it ? Why do it ? You have to look for the answers yourself.I give it 7/10.",Zodiac

The plot is about the all investigation since it's beginning in the later 60's to our days; so there are too many time holes. If there's fiction (I don't know the real facts and I didn't even read the book, so I can't be sure), and I suppose there is, it's probably just some insignificant details, because the main elements ""seem"" to be true I don't know, I just didn't appreciate too much this ""documentary style"" in this movie.

Many years later I revisited the film.""Zodiac"" is an amazing film. I don't know of many(if any) films that span such a large time-frame, and do it so effectively as it's done here. THe film just feels so real. THe violence is shocking AND shockingly well-done. It comes in short, quick, realistic doses. THere are also some genuinely scary scenes, and despite the films length, it's paced evenly and stays engrossing throughout. It's like ""All the President's Men(8/10)"" met the original ""Maniac(6/10)"", only it's significantly better than both.One of my favorite things about the film is the effective misleads, and Gylenhaal's relentless but smart, shy lead.I'm seriously considering rating this as the 4rth 10/10 from '07(There WIll Be Blood, King of Kong, U23D), and the 49th out of 4600+ ratings. It's at least worthy of a 9/10 and I find it a little mind-boggling that it's under 8 on this site.

ZODIAC is a slow-burn, like a wave it leaps up and down into thrilling moments and slow, down-paced sequences focusing on the main character's personal issues. Gyllenhaal's character is thoughtful and greatly performed as his geekish behavior and dedication to the murder-case is the movie's cornerstone, but throughout we also get a close look at Ruffalo's Steve McQueen-ish detective and Downey Jr.'s burned out soul, all three having a heavy influence on the movie's dark character. And although most of the movie's lead on by rumors and talks around the killer, it is the moments were ""Zodiac"" is portrayed that is the most scary and exciting, whether its the brutal stabbings of a loving couple at the beach or Gyllenhaal discovering he is in a basement-trap. ZODIAC portraits its tide brilliantly and is a must-see as it reflects a true investigation going from a single murder to a burned out case nobody truly bothers about.",Zodiac
188,deatman9,Serial killer movie with a great plot.,7,21 November 2012,This is one of my favorite serial killer movies. Its not a slasher or anything like that more of a crime thriller. The actors all did a very good job and the plot was interesting exspecially seeing how it was based on a true story. They took the real life plot and turned it into a very interesting movie.This movie is the true story about the Zodiac killings that happened in San Fransisco in the 60s and 70s. Detectives struggle to find out who it is when victim after victim keep being discovered.This movie was really good I really think David Fincher did a great job as well as Jake Gyllenhall. If you like a good crime mystery story then this is definitely for you. Great movie.,Zodiac

In all seriousness, Zodiac is a 2007 horror film that focuses on the real-life story of the Zodiac killings. The plot is slow, payoff takes too long, and the story is predictable. Nothing makes this film stand out besides the story it tells.3/5. Average.",Zodiac
190,ofpsmith,The Tora! Tora! Tora! of true crime films.,9,13 September 2015,"The Zodiac killer operated in San Fransisco and Vallejo, California in the late 60s and early 70s. This movie is a portrayal of the press and police investigation with out three main characters being Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal) a political cartoonist who becomes a press detective to track down the Zodiac, Paul Avery (Robert Downey Jr.) a sarcastic crime journalist, and Inspector Dave Toschi (Mark Ruffalo) a seasoned SFPD homicide detective. These are all real people and although I don't know if they were as connected to each other in real life as they are in this movie it makes the film more enjoyable. Gyllenhaal and Ruffalo are great, but Downey I think steals the show. His Bill Murray style portrayal of Avery is just brilliant. Other actors I can commend are Brian Cox who plays lawyer Melvin Belli and John Carroll Lynch who plays suspect Arthur Leigh Allen. I've always been interested in the Zodiac case and if you're interested too then check this movie out. You don't even have to be interested in the case either. You just have to enjoy a good mystery thriller.",Zodiac
191,oneloveall,"Bogged down thriller misses out on atmosphere due to ""facts""",5,2 March 2007,"Disappointingly rote, a numbing excess to this strenuously factual crime drama, relaying mysterious events surrounding a decade-long search for California's Zodiac killer, proves opposite of the engaging, palpable thriller it aspires to. What could have been one of the more solid serial killer/police dramas to emerge in the past few years instead becomes a repetitious detective procedural, coming across like the non-fiction book it is based on, but without any of it's intended cinematic flair. Instead of seizing this moment to bring viewers back into the dangerously seductive cat-and-mouse direction that gave Se7en it's urgent heart, David Fincher opts to walk the straight and narrow here, rarely even taking much artistic license to tell the potentially engrossing story. Here moviegoers are walked through the entire epic investigation, portraying all sides involved in a mostly documented manner.Admirable in it's objective ambitions, Fincher largely misses the entire point of making a movie like this for the silver screen and instead bogs the viewer down with unnecessary minutia; information that is certainly relevant to the plot's hunt for this elusive killer, but nonetheless will become entirely formulaic, leaving many viewers apathetic way too quickly. Perhaps if the ultra-objective script had it's actors trying to dress up some of the boring details they would have kept interest longer, but impressions during this lengthy film will sadly veer from cold to dull way too quickly and rarely come back to anything else. Any nuance evoked from a decent cast is immediately swept aside in favor of another bureaucratic endeavor.Presenting the majority of developments in methodical, underwhelming snippets which belie any attempts at fluidity from the acting and directing department, the film begins to feel so detached, the irony of Zodiac becoming less involving the more information is revealed becomes prevalent. As an analysis of the legally inept cross-communications which plague law enforcement, a scope remains unfulfilled, making it difficult to justify much of the intent here. Certainly not a complete failure, Zodiac remains faithful to facts of this case to a fault, rarely touching upon the haunting period qualities the movie could have so effortlessly offered, seeing greater results.",Zodiac
192,jdkraus,It felt more like a made for T.V. special on PBS rather than a real film,7,5 August 2007,"When it comes to making a film based on an event like the ""Zodiac killer"", there comes a question in which most filmmakers ask themselves, ""Should the film be more factual or more fictional?"" Hand's down, this movie is by far more fact than fiction! David Fincher, best known for ""Seven"" and ""Panic Room"" brings to life the chain events, covering over a twenty year time frame, of the five vicious murders that happened in the four districts of Western California. The movie goes in-depth with police detectives who investigated the crimes, and the reporters who queried and tried to seek the actual killer. The ensemble cast of Mark Ruffalo, Jake Gyllenhall, Robert Downey Jr., and Anthony Edwards are excellent.The combination of the accurate stories and the cast members make a great film, but ""Zodiac"" needed more than that. It needed a thrilling pace like ""Panic Room"". The first hour of the film was steady, but after that, the film dragged and drifted from different scenes about prank callers, kooks on the street who claim their the ""Zodiac killer"", and far-fetched theories that both the police and the news reporters try to figure out with absolutely no luck.I grew very bored. For awhile, I felt like was watching a ""made for T.V. special on PBS"" rather than a movie. However, the last twenty minutes of the film followed into the suspense that Mr. Fincher is very well known for and he managed to tie a fair amount of the knots at the end, leaving some plot holes. I honestly felt there wasn't enough mysterious drama or suspense to make the movie a real good thriller.7/10",Zodiac
193,Superunknovvn,Possibly Fincher's best movie so far,8,9 June 2007,"""Zodiac"" is a great movie about a highly intriguing killing spree that took place in the U.S.A. in the late 60's. Some moviegoers may have been under the impression that this is a movie in the vein of Fincher's ""Se7en"", but that is not the case. ""Zodiac"" is mainly a character study of the men who hunted the ""Zodiac"" killer. That's not to say that ""Zodiac"" isn't thrilling, but it's not your typical ""cops hunt maniac""-movie.The story is apparently very faithful to actual events. This goes all the way to the brutal killings, which are among the most realistic ever put to screen. Every time Zodiac appears it's spine chilling, whether you see how he kills in detail or just hear his creepy voice and see his victim's reaction.The murders are not in the spotlight, of the movie, though. It's the investigation of the crimes as the years pass by. The movie has a certain vintage look about it with brownish-colors and little light. The music picked is also very appropriate for the periods of time the movie depicts.More original than the ""Silence Of The Lambs""-clone ""Se7en"", less preaching than ""Fight Club"" and simply better than ""Alien 3"", ""The Game"" and ""Panic Room"", ""Zodiac"" is probably David Fincher's best movie so far and one of the few highlights of this summer.",Zodiac
194,Carycomic,One word: whoa!,9,5 March 2007,"I was a class-room clown, in grammar school, when most of the events, in this highly suspenseful true story, took place. So, all I knew about the Zodiac Killer, before getting into see this movie, was that he had never officially been caught.And, now I know why.The first-third of the movie is undeniably the creepiest, as the actual murders occur, and you hear voiced over recordings of the killer anonymously phoning the cops to virtually brag about it! That's also where you're introduced to Robert Downey, Jr. as a cynical, semi-alcoholic, and apparently gay crime reporter; Jake Gyllenhaal as an editorial cartoonist with an obsessive-compulsive penchant for puzzles and cryptographs; and Mark Ruffalo as the SFPD detective who ultimately--and unfairly--bears the lion's share of responsibility for never bringing in the killer.How the murders, and the mocking letters that gradually outnumber them, affect each of the above-mentioned characters is what makes the final third of the movie less (inevitably) boring than the middle third. Gyllenhaal, especially, makes you want to scream out loud, at the movie screen: ""Get a life, you idiot! You're wife is right!"" Some of you are probably asking yourselves, right now, why I don't give this a perfect ten, if I liked it so much. Simple: the semi-fictionalized murder scene at the lake. The disclaimer at the start of the film said that the whole thing was based on actual case files. But, if neither the man nor the woman--so brutally stabbed at the lake--survived, how did Robert Graysmith get that part about the Zodiac Killer claiming to have escaped from a prison in Montana?",Zodiac
195,DarthVoorhees,Fincher's Finest,10,8 March 2007,"It's really too bad that David Fincher doesn't make movies on a more regular basis because Zodiac and his previous films are masterful work. I imagine Zodiac was a hard project for any director to tackle because they never caught the SOB, but for an artist like Fincher there would be no other way to do it. Fincher understands that the reason the Zodiac killings became so legendary is because this monster was a modern day Jack the Ripper, a creature in the shadows, and we all ways fear what we don't know.Fincher chose the right project, he is a modern day Hitchcock and he is able to surround the Zodiac with mystery as it should be. Rumors had it Gary Oldman was offered the role,I gotta thank Gary for turning it down because the Zodiac is supposed to be a devil in the shadows and Gary would just take too much attention from what is supposed to be a mystery For those concerned about Fincher's use of violence, the killings are all done relatively early in the movie. The movie is a brilliant psychological thriller above anything else, the story is about four men and how the Zodiac killer effected their lives. There is a great scene in the movie where our two police detectives Toschi and Armstrong investigate the scene of taxi driver Paul Stein's murder, the interaction between these great actors and the visuals are outstanding and they were composed by one of the masters of film. Fincher can do that, he has the ability to turn the ordinary into the extraordinary. Zodiac is a visually spectacular film. Fincher has a lot of fun with his camera work and set design. One is in awe over the tour of the San Francisco skyline, which if done by a regular director would be considered simple. Fincher has assembled an outstanding cast as well. Robert Downey Jr and Mark Ruffalo particularly stand out with outstanding performances. Downey Jr should receive an Oscar nomination for his portrayal of Paul Avery. This role was tailer made for him. Jake Gyllenthal is good as Graysmith but then again there wasn't much story to go with along with Graysmith's investigation into the killings. My only real complaint is that more of the movie should have been spent with Toschi and his investigation. Zodiac also works well as a period peace. Fincher spares no expense in bringing us back to the early 70's. Everything is picture perfect right down to the old static TV set. What works best with Zodiac is that Fincher doesn't try to solve the case himself, or present his ideas on who done it. He takes his source material in Graysmith's book and presents it in a thrilling movie. Yes Arthur Leigh Allen is Graysmith's favorite suspect but he has never been proved to be the killer and so Fincher provides an alternative with the investigation into Rick Marshall, another popular Zodiac suspect. The 2007 movie season has finally begun. Zodiac is thrilling and suspenseful and is by far the best movie of this new year.",Zodiac
196,tomimt,Good thriller,8,28 March 2009,"I don't know a thing about the Zodiac case and in fact I hadn't even heard of the Zodiac killer before this movie, mainly because I'm not from the U.S. So given that, I could watch Fincher's ""Zodiac"" without much of bias in one direction or another, and for what it is worth, I quite enjoyed this chase of a killer, whose real identity was never confirmed to an absolute fact.""Zodiac"" is more of a story about obsessions and what it can do to a person, than a study of a serial killer. This is mainly because the real killer was in reality left unproven, so the movie follows more of the investigators and Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal) than the prime subject of the case Arthur Leigh Allen (John Carroll Lynch).The story is mainly well written and Fincher's direction is always good, which helps to forgive some scenes, that don't seem to serve much of a purpose in the larger scale. All in all, a good, yet not superb, serial killer mystery.",Zodiac
197,Darkside-Reviewer,"""Please rush to editor""",8,28 May 2020,"There have been a lot of movies that attempt to tell the true stories of notorious serial killers from famous cases like Jack the Ripper, Ed Gein and in this case the Zodiac Killer case which is one of the most famous cases of a serial killer who was never caught and famously avoided capture and even taunted police and the press this movie is a modern day telling of the events that transpired throughout the 60s and early 70s.This isn't the first Zodiac inspired movie to be made there have been famous movies that took inspiration from the real life events one being the awsome and bad ass movie (Dirty Harry) which is now considered a classic but there have been many other movies and documentaries that tell the Zodiac killer case story and attempt to examine the history of the case and the massive impact it had on people and society at the time it happened.This movie I feel is probably the best Zodiac movie that could ever and will ever be made and that's not because it's a big Hollywood movie with a big budget and big name actors attached to it or anything like that it's because of two reasons the first being that the director of the movie is David Fincher who is a brilliant movie director and really brings the 60s and 70s to life in this movie from the set designs to even just the colours and patterns used for simple things like carpets, seats and blankets it feels like a step back in time.The second reason I think this movie is the best Zodiac movie is because of the amount of detail that went into the making of this movie both the storyline being as accurate as possible aswell as taking the real life experiences and stories from the actual survivor's of the Zodiac killer who they interviewed themselves and did their best to recreate the terrible events that took place not just the actions of what happened but also real life discussions that took place during the events even including the way they were sat in their cars or in one case lay down by a lakeside these unique details give the movie a terrifyingly real feel to it.I watched the Directors Cut special edition of the movie on Blu Ray including the extras that were on the disk which include real life interviews with the police officers, detective's, police dispatchers, that were there the night each murder took place which is very interesting and unique as the murders took place in different cities so there's different officers each time and they managed to get interviews with nearly everyone that was there on the nights of the murders each telling their own very unique feelings and experiences of the events that took place. There are even interviews with the survivors of the Zodiac killer and in one instance a survivor goes with the crew back to where it happened and describes the events that took place and is even quoted as saying that the scene's in the movie of the attack are very accurate to what happened on that day.The acting from all involved is top quality no amateur performances in this movie and you can see that this was a movie that was taken seriously by all involved.A funny side note after rewatching this movie recently in 2020 is that the movie stars (Jake Gyllenhaal) who played Mystero in Spiderman Far From Home recently in 2019 also in the movie is (Mark Ruffalo) who plays The Hulk in The Avengers MCU movies and the movie also stars (Robert Downey Jr) who plays Iron Man in the MCU movies this was obviously before the first movie in the MCU Iron Man in 2008 was released but it's funny to think that there's Avengers in this movie.I highly recommend watching this movie if your a fan of true crime thriller movies and enjoy movies that take their time telling you a interesting and thought provoking story on real life events.",Zodiac

199,DonFishies,"Meticulously detailed and authentic, but overly boring in some cases",8,9 March 2007,"Despite having borrowed it from my friend more than three years ago, I cannot fathom watching more than the first twenty-five minutes of Alien³. Fortunately enough, it is the only film directed by David Fincher that I have yet to watch. The rest of his films I have seen, and really like (other than the not so great Panic Room). So I waited for Zodiac with great anticipation. I held high hopes despite it being delayed, but after watching it, I think it should have been delayed a little longer.Starting with a hideous murder on July 4, 1969, the film chronicles the mass hysteria caused by a killer who only referred to himself as the Zodiac. He sends a letter to the San Francisco Chronicle listing off details only he would know about the murder. Crime reported Paul Avery (Robert Downey Jr.) begins to follow the case intently, while cartoonist Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal) slowly becomes more obsessed with finding out the truth. At the same time, Inspector Dave Toschi (Mark Ruffalo) and Inspector William Armstrong (Anthony Edwards) are following the case turn by turn.Fincher's long-awaited return is meticulous in its depiction of 1970's San Francisco. Every setting looks like it was recreated exactly to fit the time period. The newsroom looks like a near recreation of the one in All the President's Men, with all the smoking, lit up telephone lines and typewriters to boot. The attention to even the most minute details is just jarring, but only adds to how authentic the film feels. The film is also fairly homage filled, with one sequence involving a taxi cab looking exactly like the overhead tracking shots in Taxi Driver. The amount of material that Fincher covers in the film is just astonishing. The first hour or so covers almost a year of recreated details, and as the film goes on, it just trucks along with how much time goes by in the case. It was also very interesting to see how some days were covered in the film, frequently having moments spent dwindling on some days, and just blasting through others. It helped to have the little subtitles telling us the time of day and what day it actually was too.But it is the great attention to detail that also hurts the film. It feels like Fincher did not that with adding so many details, just makes the film's runtime extend out for quite awhile. I did not figure that the 158-minute runtime would be all that bad, but it just feels really stretched out after a while. I really liked all of the little details and quirks he added for all of the characters (including Toschi's adoration for animal crackers) and situations, but a lot of them just unneeded after awhile. It becomes downright boring in some places, and really begs the question of just how much material Fincher originally had covered in the film. It reminded me a lot of Robert De Niro's recent directorial effort The Good Shepherd in many places, with how much detail and material it covered. But at least here a lot of the material is interesting rather than in the former, but the film really struck me as being more like a documentary than like a regular film.All of the acting is thankfully wonderful. Downey Jr. is pitch perfect as the consistently drunk/high journalist. He brings a lot to the table, and even though he is not in the entire film, his presence is felt throughout. He is spot-on in his acting, and he also brings a much needed humour to the film. Ruffalo is also very good in his role. The slow obsession the character goes through and eventual realizations are all very well depicted, and only continue to show off his true acting chops. I have liked this guy from the start, and he only continues to impress me as he continues acting. Just watching his nervous demeanour during a screening of Dirty Harry is just marvelous in how well he conveys the character's feelings on screen.Gyllenhaal however, I was a bit on the fence with. I really like him as an actor, but here, his character just does not seem ""right"". His emotions are great, and so is his acting as per usual, but it just does not seem to be enough for his character. For some reason as the film shifts from focusing on Downey Jr. and Ruffalo to him, it just feels awkward, and is one of the reasons the film feels dragged out. He just does not seem to be able to hold all of the fabric together in a lot of scenes (despite the film being inspired by his real life counterparts books), and as the film spins out of control in how long it goes on for, so too does Gyllenhaal's character. He does great for the most part yes, but he just does hold up well against the other two main actors.The supporting cast, despite their small amount of time on screen, are all pretty good in their roles. I have not seen Edwards in a long time, but he really impressed me as Toschi's partner. He is clearly overshadowed by Ruffalo, but he does well for himself anyway. Phillip Baker Hall, Brian Cox and Elias Koteas also do very well for themselves. I was a little disappointed with Chloë Sevigny, but only because she is such a great actress, and is so underused here.On the whole, while it is so truthful and authentic in its depiction of the Zodiac case, it just feels overlong and becomes boring too soon. A little bit more editing and less focus on Gyllenhaal probably would have helped the film greatly. But as it stands, it is a good recreation of the events, and will probably be remembered for just how meticulously detailed it was.8/10.",Zodiac
200,msbreviews,Preparation for Mank: Zodiac successfully transmits its characters' obsession to the audience.,8,23 November 2020,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)If you've been following me closely for the past week, I'm currently (re)watching five of David Fincher's films in preparation for his next movie, Mank, which premieres on Netflix in a couple of weeks. I've already revisited Se7en and Fight Club, two iconic films that not only profoundly impacted filmmaking but also our culture. However, Zodiac isn't one of Fincher's most popular movies, and maybe that's one of the reasons why I'm watching it for the very first time. Based on a real story, Fincher's first non-fiction adaptation is also one of the longest films of his career. I didn't know anything about the true events before watching this movie, which leads me to the biggest compliment I can offer to this type of film.There are hundreds of characteristics that a viewer can observe, analyze, and through them, ultimately form an overall opinion about a movie. Nevertheless, when it comes to cinematic adaptations of a true story, there's always one aspect that I value tremendously, which is how much the film convinces me to research about its story after I finish watching it. Truth is, midway through Zodiac, I started to acknowledge its lengthy duration. Don't be mistaken. It's not what people call a ""slow movie"", much on the contrary. It's long, yes, but it's packed with non-stop, rapid-fire dialogues that Fincher himself asked the actors to speed up so that the runtime wouldn't stretch even more.Throughout the entire film, I feel the exact same manner as the main characters. For the first hour or so, the case is ramping up, the murders increase in quantity, new developments emerge, just like new suspects, letters, ciphers, and everything that comes with dealing with this serial killer. During this period, I feel extremely captivated, but then comes a phase where the characters themselves start to give up due to the lack of concrete evidence to finally convict a suspect. I feel the frustration, depression, and even the infuriating absence of a clear path to the killer. However, Robert Graysmith's (Jake Gyllenhaal) obsession with the case starts becoming my own, and the last thirty minutes are incredibly stressful, frightful, and enthusiastic.Zodiac possesses 157 minutes, mostly consisting of talking and only a couple of stylish, slow-motion murder scenes, so obviously, this is a dialogue-driven narrative. James Vanderbilt's screenplay is packed with detailed characterization, extensive conversations, and from what I could gather, an impressive historical accuracy. Fincher and Vanderbilt prove their unbelievable commitment with the mind-blowing preparation for this flick, which basically included an entirely unique investigation on the real case (interviewing the people who give life to the movie's protagonists, family members, police departments, witnesses, etc.). Yet another evidence that supports the importance of the pre-production phase in filmmaking.So, in case I forget to answer my own question, Zodiac achieved its primary mission. As soon as the film ended, I found myself googling everything about the real case, trying to find out new information, obsessed with the intriguing story. It doesn't even matter if the viewer loves the movie or not, its impact is undeniable since most people will feel the same urgency to understand more about the real case. Two other attributes deeply contribute to this result: the cast and the editing. The latter is performed by Angus Wall, and his work is some of the best film editing I've ever witnessed. It's the main reason why the huge runtime feels adequate and why the narrative moves so well. No wonder almost every job of his got so many award nominations.Finally, the actors are all extraordinary. Mark Ruffalo (Dave Toschi), Anthony Edwards (Bill Armstrong), Robert Downey Jr. (Paul Avery), and Jake Gyllenhaal portray distinct, well-developed characters who deal with the case in their own way. Obsession is definitely the fundamental social theme present in the movie, depicted differently with each character. Armstrong completely moves on and never looks back. Toschi tries to forget, but he can't accept that he failed to do his job. Avery develops a mental condition and/or addiction due to its inability to deal with the pressure, stress, and frustration of reporting the case. Graysmith lets his total obsession over Zodiac impact his personal life, affecting his family in the process.Fincher is able to represent each and every one of these behaviors in an astonishingly realistic fashion. The use of long uninterrupted takes helps the conversations flow better, and the simple, non-distracting camera work from Harry Savides lets the viewer focus on who they're listening to. It's one of those films which I can't really point out direct flaws. There's that period during the second act where I start to feel tired and worn out, and despite the irreprehensible dedication to providing every single bit of knowledge about the actual events, it's still an enormous amount of information to process, which made me feel a bit lost occasionally. Fortunately, the movie ends strongly, culminating in a simple yet powerful exchange of looks.All in all, Zodiac gains the most generous praise that a film based on a true story can ever receive from me. James Vanderbilt's screenplay convinced me to research everything about the real events as soon as the movie finished, which is undeniably an impactful effect of watching such a well-written, captivating narrative with well-developed, authentic characters. David Fincher's commitment to being as historically accurate as possible is visible on-screen, a remarkable result of a massive preparation that very few filmmakers would even think about performing. With some of the best editing work in the history of cinema, the lengthy runtime flows better than expected, but the amount of information to digest is overwhelming and tiresome, dropping the levels of entertainment, especially during a certain period of the second act. Nevertheless, a phenomenal third act, three outstanding performances from Mark Ruffalo, Robert Downey Jr., and Jake Gyllenhaal, and an emotionally compelling, realistic approach to extreme obsession turn the entire film into one of the best of its genre. Another massive recommendation from this side.Rating: A-",Zodiac

203,rajdoctor,Zodiac,8,11 June 2007,"I knew this movie was directed by David Fincher (Fight Club, Panic Room, Seven, Game, Alien), and that makes it irresistible for movie lovers like me. But I always read HATE reviews on IMDb before I go to see the movie, so that I would be more critical in my outlook and look at the movie in a more balanced way. This time too I read the utterly bad reviews of Zodiac, and with cross fingers entered the hall.The story is simple, based on true events, spans from 1963 - 1970 multiple murders by a person named Zodiac in Northern California. The case remains open, unsolved till date; with the closest suspect Arthur Leigh Allen dead in 1992, it only remains (and will always remain) a speculation of sorts  who the real Zodiac Killer was.Zodiac is one of the very popular American subject since 1960s - 9 movies, 5 TV serials, 4 graphic novels, 6 novels and numerous magazine articles  showcases this. Everyone knows the story. It has been told in so many types, ways and fashion  that the only interesting point as a spectator is to see how David Fincher tells the story differently. As all of you can imagine, the task was uphill from the very beginning, include the personal baggage of his good movies that he needs to prove his worth. I say, too much of a burden on David's shoulder.David Fincher could have taken a narrative style very functional to the commercial format, which has already been used time and again  serial killers  till we are bored to death seeing those movies. But David Fincher uses a totally classical style of directing this thriller. He takes his time (148 minutes in total), he keeps the storyline simple and straight forward (no flashbacks), he uses the novelistic style of narrative  that slowly unfolds and engages you; he uses not a big star-cast to blow the script and screenplay off its ground.I not only enjoyed the movie but loved it too. Fantastic is my verdict. One more feather on David's cap. There are several characters and actors (Jake Gyllenhaal, Mark Ruffalo, Anthony Edwards, Robert Downey, John Carroll etc.), but I won't spend time writing about any of them, because the movie solely belongs to David  the director's medium! Those who have written poor and hated reviews were expecting a Dirty Harry (one of the foremost Zodiac adaptation) style; or a Fight Club  and surely they are disappointed. I only say that their minds are one dimensional and David Fincher has risen above fan club's earthly expectations to do something daringly different and he succeeds in it.Hats off to David Fincher! Looking forward to seeing his next venture - The Curious case of Benjamin Button; where he comes with a huge star cast  Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett.(Stars 8 out of 10)",Zodiac
204,WriterDave,Effectively Creepy and Engrossing True Crime Tale,8,6 March 2007,"David Fincher has taken nearly five years off between films, and he has returned a more mature and accomplished director with his fascinating ""Zodiac."" It may not reach the cult status of his ""Seven"" or ""Fight Club"" or find the box office success of ""Panic Room,"" but by many measures it may be his most carefully crafted film. More in line with the crime epics of directors like Michael Mann than with the typical serial-killer thriller, ""Zodiac"" is propelled by inventive direction, a great cast, engaging attention to detail, and a killer soundtrack of classic songs from the late 1960's and 1970's.Based on the book by Robert Graysmith (played effectively here by Jake Gyllenhaal), ""Zodiac"" is meticulous in its details (both in dialogue and Fincher's finely painted visuals) and sprawling in plot and its parade of intriguing characters. Mark Ruffalo is especially compelling playing the lead detective who becomes obsessed with the case, and Robert Downey Jr. does his best macabre comic relief job as the boozing and drugging reporter Paul Avery who was targeted for a brief time by the infamous killer. There's also a fine supporting cast featuring Brian Cox, Chloe Sevigny, and John Caroll Lynch among many others, all doing top notch work.Fincher's digital VIPER camera lends itself surprising well to the period detail and look of the 1970's. Though some of the more brightly lit shots aren't as clear and in focus as you would like, this is the first movie I can think of shot on all digital where some of the cinematography could actually be called beautiful (check out any of the skyline shots and the great overhead of the Golden Gate Bridge). Fincher crafts some truly creepy moments using simple lighting techniques featuring characters hopping into strange cars on deserted highways, traipsing through dimly lit homes, or nervously making their way down a dark creaky staircase into a fathomless basement. There's also some nice freak-out moments in the classy and sharply filmed murder scenes and when characters receive eerie phone-calls from the so-called killer or his equally sick copycats. I didn't realize how effective Fincher's technique was until I went home alone to my dark apartment and felt a sudden lump in my throat when a friend made an unexpected late night call.There are times when the film becomes bogged down with police procedural aspects, and its epic runtime is apparent, though most of the slow parts still remain engrossing. Graysmith makes it clear who he thinks the killer was, though the case was officially unsolved. When all the pieces finally fit together, the audience feels the same sickening giddiness as Graysmith and the detectives long plagued by the cryptic case that held much of San Franciso hostage knowing that the prime suspect will never be convicted on so much circumstantial evidence. In the end, Fincher leaves you with some haunting feelings, and if anything is certain, it's that Donovan's ""Hurdy Gurdy Man"" will never be listened to the same again.",Zodiac
205,LoneWolfAndCub,"Great return for Fincher; an excellent, atmospheric thriller",8,24 November 2007,"Let's get this out of the way first, this is not Fincher's best movie, but it does not matter. ""Se7en"" and ""Fight Club"" are two amazing movies that Fincher will struggle to better but that does not mean he will never make a great movie again. Zodiac is a moody, captivating thriller from start to finish. All the actors were amazing, the soundtrack was perfect and Fincher's direction is flawless.Zodiac is based on Robert Graysmith's book about the Zodiac serial killer who murdered randomly in San Fransisco in the 1960's and 1970's. The movie follows a group of people investigating these murders. There is Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal), a cartoonist for a newspaper, Inspector David (Mark Ruffalo) and his partner Inspector William (Anthony Edwards) and Paul Avery (Robert Downey, Jr.), a columnist who specializes in crime.The movie can be split into two parts. The opening scene (which is brilliant, might I add) shows the Zodiac killing a young couple. We see a few more of his killings then the movie changes pace from this disturbing and dark murder mystery to a slower, more character driven investigation into the Zodiac.Both these parts are equally important to the whole story, which runs at about 158 minutes, a fairly lengthy time. This unfortunately is the only negative of the movie for me, in some places it does drag a little bit which detracts from the mood which is disappointing because a few cuts could have made this a perfect movie. Because everything else is.All the actors are really quite good, especially Gyllenhaal, who really plays a socially awkward nerd very well. The soundtrack is perfectly suited to the time when this movie was set, as are the costumes. And of course, like all of Fincher's movies, this has plenty of style.4/5",Zodiac
206,Antagonisten,Lacks something,6,23 October 2007,"It was hard for me to know what to expect when i sat down to watch ""Zodiac"". The word beforehand ranged from ""very good"" to ""unbelievably slow and boring"". As usual the truth was somewhere between the extremes.""Zodiac"" has one major flaw and one major advantage. We can start with the advantage: the actors. It was a long time since i saw a movie with this kind of ensemble. It seems almost every face is instantly recognizable from movies and TV, and all performances are top-notch. I especially liked Mark Ruffalos cop and John Carroll Lynch as an unusually creepy suspect. Brian Cox is as usual excellent in one of the best scenes of the movie (the TV-scene).The major flaw in my opinion was the pacing. I acknowledge that it's a fairly complicated movie (although not so much as many have tried to claim) and that it encompasses a lot of time. While that may be true, there are still ways to make time fly a bit faster for the audience. In the beginning of the movie the pace was pretty good and the tension was high. But as the movie went on that seemed to bleed off. There are a few moments when the nerve returns in the end, but i still looked at my watch number of times in the last hour.The pacing problem might suggest that i didn't like ""Zodiac"". But that's not true at all. Rather it's a good movie that has a few flaws that keep it from being great. The pacing being the worst of those. It has definite qualities though. The acting was the first one i mentioned. The second is the scope of the movie, it's an ambitious project to show decades of police work with the intense beginning and the dreary and long investigation, long after the media interest has died down.In the end this won't make it into my favorite movies because of something i can't really put my finger on. This movie lacks something. While it has an interesting story, great acting and ambition, there is still something missing. It would be pretentious to call it ""heart"", but somehow that's the way it feels. David Fincher has always been a very competent but sometimes emotionally detached director. Sometimes that spills over and makes you care less about the movie than you would like to. That's unfortunately the feeling i got with ""Zodiac"".",Zodiac
207,dfa120374,Nothing Fantastic But Still A Very Enjoyable Thriller,6,10 July 2015,"Zodiac ticks all the boxes for a very good mystery crime thriller...a great cast, nicely filmed, and well written. Unfortunately, the ""decent pace"" box cannot be checked as I found the film to be just a bit too slow, and I actually found myself struggling not to nod off about halfway through. Thankfully, the film maintained enough interest later on to alleviate all desire to fall asleep completely.The film start's off decently enough with a nice, steady developing story with an adequate pace that we're accustomed to seeing in a thriller of this type, but after about an hour or so, nothing much picks up and it felt as if it just trudged on for a good while until picking up again within the last 45 minutes.I must say that one thing that did impress me about the movie was the attention to detail Fincher put into trying to recreate an accurate telling of the Zodiac case. I mean yes there were fictionalised parts (the Graysmith/Avery friendship for one), but any director who spends 18 months researching the case, interviewing countless people including witnesses, family members, former detectives, and even suspects, and goes to the trouble of having trees flown in to make a particular landmark look the way it did 40 years prior deserves recognition for attempted accuracy. Films like this, Se7en, The Game, and Panic Room proved he was capable of being much more than just a music video director.The film's cast is fantastic with Gyllenhaal, Ruffalo, Edwards, and Downey Jr. all giving great performances, especially Downey Jr., who I'm not a fan of but was excellent here, and Gyllenhaal who continues to get better and better with the different roles he plays (check out Nighcrawler & Southpaw for more evidence of this).In saying all of that, is Zodiac a great film? No, but it IS a very good film and it's definitely worth a watch if you enjoy films of this type.",Zodiac
208,SquigglyCrunch,An Engaging Mystery Thriller Filled with Unexpected Twists and Genuine Tension,9,3 November 2016,"Zodiac follows a magazine company as a killer calling himself Zodiac contacts them. The police use the letters received to hunt down the killer, meanwhile the criminal writer in the company conducts his own search, and the cartoonist develops a sort of obsession with finding Zodiac. The performances are pretty much what I've come to expect from these actors. Jake Gyllenhaal, one of my favorite actors, pulls off a pretty great performance, and Robert Downey Jr. is pretty great too. The biggest surprise for me was from Mark Ruffalo. I haven't been horribly impressed by him in the past, not to say he's a bad actor by any means, but he's just not amazing. Until Zodiac, that is. He's pretty fantastic, and definitely someone I'll be looking forward to seeing in the future. The rest of the performances are noticeably better than one might expect. The whole story is just very interesting. It's presented in such a way so that every one of the three leads receives a pretty equal amount of screen time, and the story dedicates itself to wherever the most important stuff is happening. There will be plenty of times where certain characters aren't seen for long stretches of time, which isn't a bad thing, but rather keeps the movie going at a good pace, which is especially important for a movie with a run time like this one. It hits 2 hours and 37 minutes, and thankfully it wasn't at all boring. Not only is the pacing great, but the story is filled with twists and turns, bursts of tension and intrigue. It's just such a fascinating story, filled with all sorts of possible endings. Part of why the pacing is so good is because of these scenes. Tension rises, and you as the audience begins to believe that the movie may be wrapping up, but then it surprises you yet again and continues. There were multiple points where I thought the movie was getting close to ending, and that was never the case. I never checked how much time I had left, partly to better immerse myself into the movie and not worry about the time, but also because I just didn't want the movie to end. It never fakes the audience out of the ending, but it seems like it could be getting close a couple times, so the audience is prepared for it to continue, but not just end in a few minutes. The characters themselves are also just really interesting to watch. They play off of each other very well and are fleshed out when they need to be. Moreover, their relationships are well-developed over the course of the entire Zodiac case. The choice to only show scenes relating to the case itself is both a good thing and somewhat a bad thing, in that there is little to nothing shown about the characters interacting with anyone or doing anything that doesn't involve the Zodiac. The characters are still well-developed during the time it takes to find Zodiac, and I appreciate that it was able to pull this off without ever straying from the case. I think that if the movie tried to switch to the characters and their own family conflicts and all that it would have been out-of-place, but it also could have added something to the characters. Not including that aspect didn't take away from the movie, however, so it's hardly something to complain about. I'm glad that the movie chose not to add any non-Zodiac material because it makes the movie focused and stand out more, but if done right it could have added to the movie, maybe. It's more something I just thought I should address and less of an issue in the actual movie. Overall Zodiac is fantastic. It's got great performances all around, the pacing is fantastic, the characters are well-developed and interesting, the whole story is fascinating and tense, and the choices in presentation are smart. In the end I would definitely recommend this movie.",Zodiac
209,ronakkotian,Fincher's most underrated film,10,3 February 2021,"With Se7en, Fincher created one of the best fictional crime films to ever exist and with Zodiac, he created one of the best factual crime films to ever exist.Zodiac is about the mysterious Zodiac killings that took place during the late 60s to early 70s and shows us the investigation into the case.I think Zodiac might just be David Fincher's most underrated film. It's not one I hear about much compared to some of his other films in his filmography but I wish it was discussed more often because I think Zodiac is absolutely fantastic. The film takes a different approach to telling this story by focusing more on the investigators rather than the killer itself. It manages to tap into the minds of the people carrying out the investigation and showing the obsession and bewilderment they had trying to figure out who the Zodiac killer was. Fincher keeps this film grounded throughout and in a way that makes the story all the more scarier. Knowing that this really happened, Fincher's realistic execution of the events and situations bring out the eerieness required for a crime thriller without much exaggeration. The depiction of the murders are horrifying despite the lack of gore and that's due to the realism involved within those scenes. That being said, some people may be put off by the long 2 hour 30 minute runtime but I was so fascinated by the investigation that I didn't realise how quickly time went by. It's not easy making a long film engaging the whole time but editor Angus Wall did a great job maintaining the intrigue.Jake Gyllenhaal is truly fantastic here as the cartoonist, Robert Graysmith. I could sense the obsession and passion he had to solve this case. It's a subtle performance that communicates the character's thoughts and feelings brilliantly. Mark Ruffalo does a terrific job as Inspector David Toschi and Robert Downey Jr. gives one of his best performances here as Paul Avery.Zodiac is easily one of my favourite crime thrillers. The story is interesting all the way through and leads to a brilliant and suspenseful third act that had me tense. It's sad I don't hear about this film as much as Fincher's other ones but I'm so glad I saw it and I would highly recommend it.",Zodiac
210,AvionPrince16,A good fincher movie.,7,18 August 2021,This movie can contain some disturbing images but the investigation about who is the zodiac is very interesting and make us want to know who is it. Some of scenes can be scary and creepy that s make the movie more enjoyable and believable. Nice movie for sure. Worth to watch it!,Zodiac
211,MichaelMargetis,An Superb and Intricate Telling of One of the Most Intriguing Serial Killer Stories of All Time,8,19 November 2007,"Captain Marty Lee: You got any hard suspects? Dave Toschi: Uh, about 90 an hour. I'm up to about 500.Undoubtedly, one of the most underrated filmmakers working in the business today is David Fincher. His original and darkly grim vision as a director was responsible for four fantastic films (Se7en, The Game, Fight Club and Panic Room), and yet he hasn't gotten a single Oscar, Golden Globe or Critics Awards nomination. That's a real shame, but in Hollywood that's a harsh reality. It's easy to spot a Fincher film from watching it, it's pretty much always darkly shot and fast-paced. However, with 'Zodiac', the talented director's sixth feature film, Fincher takes a slightly different approach in his style. 'Zodiac' is still grim but instead of being fast-moving it's leisurely-paced at an unbelievably lengthy runtime of 160 minutes (2 hours and 40 minutes). This is not to say the film drags, because it doesn't. 'Zodiac' needs every second of those 160 minutes to tell it's complicated story of the real-life Zodiac killer.The films spans nearly thirty years, beginning with one of the Zodiac killer's first murders in mid-1969, and concludes sometime in the year 1991. The movie is based off Robert Graysmith's book, who to no surprise at all is the film's main character. Graysmith is played by Jake Gyllenhaal, and he's a young and clean-cut cartoonist for the San Francisco chronicle. When the Zodiac murders begin, the office receives encoded letters from the Zodiac killer which Graysmith helps crack. As the movie progresses, we meet the other main character, Inspector Dave Toschi played by Mark Ruffalo, who is heading the police investigation of the Zodiac killer. The third character which can't really be considered a ""lead"" is one of Graysmith's unstable colleagues at the San Francisco Chronicle, Paul Avery (Robert Downey, Jr.), who along with Graysmith and Toschi becomes obsessed with solving the case. That's about all I'll tell you about the plot.Although 'Zodiac' isn't as good as say 'Se7en' or 'Fight Club', it's a great film that will no doubt go unappreciated by most audience members. The biggest downfall of the movie is it's runtime, since most people these days have like extreme A.D.D. Most viewers will find it kind of boring and not suspenseful enough, but they'll forget to remember it's based on a REAL life story, and REAL life murder cases aren't like f_cking 'CSI' episodes where the thrills never stop and everything is so over-the-top it's implausible. During the entire two hours and forty minutes I was never bored and found the story intriguing. My only real complaint is that the film never becomes compelling or powerful. Maybe this was not the intention, but for a film surrounding a gruesome murder case and the frustration of solving it, there is little emotion within it.One of the best aspects of the movie without a doubt is the acting. Jake Gyllenhaal is very good in a semi-dry role, but he is playing the role he usually always plays. With the exception of his performances in 'Jarhead' and 'Brokeback Mountain', I've never really seen Gyllenhaal play a different character. This is not to say he's not decent, but just to say he's not impressive. However, on the other side of the spectrum, Mark Ruffalo is absolutely sensational in a subtle but effective performance as the irritated but determined police inspector. Ruffalo steals the film from Gyllenhaal without even trying. In another great but much smaller performance, Robert Downey, Jr. adds some much needed comic relief as the drug addict/alcoholic newspaper columnist who pisses the Zodiac off by describing him as a 'latent homosexual' in one of his articles. Perhaps Downey is so perfect in this role because he is the role. All the other supporting performances are spot-on for the most part, two to mention are John Carroll Lynch (Carnivale, The Drew Carrey Show) who is brilliantly unsettling and creepy and Brian Cox in a very small but very memorable performance as obnoxious real-life lawyer Melvin Belli. Fincher, of course, does another extraordinary job directing this, and Harris Savides' cinematography is marvelous.In conclusion, I highly recommend this for those who aren't expecting a fast-paced action-packed and awesomely gruesome suspense-thriller, but instead an intelligent, slow-paced and finely acted slice of history. It's probably the best offering of 2007 thus far. Grade: B+ (review written 3/2/07)",Zodiac
212,saadanathan,Terrifying and great at the same time 7/10,7,7 September 2020,"""Zodiac"" is a fantastic movie by who else then David Fincher? If there is a director that can make terrifying movies such as this one it's definitely Fincher. A movie that is both scary as hell and cinematic amazing. Based on a true story: Zodiac retells the story of the Zodiac killer from San Francisco back in the 60's and 70's. The movie depicts the whole investigation from the journalists and the police department, as well as showing a few murders that have happened involving the Zodiac killer. I loved the acting during the film: Jake Gyllenhaal, Robert Downey jr. and Mark Ruffalo are great actors who capture perfectly their characters and have good interactions between them. The movie is just really scary. If I was scared before from ""Sleepy Hollow"" then this movie tops it. But it was a fabulous experience. Fincher seems to always top everyone when it comes to movies and how to create a terrifying story.",Zodiac
213,andrewroy-04316,"Endlessly absorbing, technically impeccable, and intelligently told, Zodiac is a marvelous thriller",10,4 August 2020,"Both on a technical level and as a smart thriller, Zodiac absolutely blew me away. I see shades of its influence on another of my favorite movies, Villenueve's Prisoners, and Fincher's wonderful show on a similar subject matter, Mindhunter. Zodiac is a fair account of a true story, which only makes it that much more remarkable. At its heart, Zodiac is really a tale of the men who are trying to catch Zodiac and in particular Graysmith's obsession with finding him. Especially having read I'll Be Gone In The Dark, a true crime book of one woman's determination to catch another notorious California killer, I can appreciate the way these types of seemingly random and unprovoked murders uniquely strike fear into the hearts of citizens. The movie even explicitly mentions this - look at how many people get murdered every year in San Francisco; the Zodiac killer is a blip on the radar in the grand scheme of things. And yet, that looming threat is truly scary, which Fincher plays with brilliantly by ratcheting up the tension late in the movie when we aren't sure what the Zodiac killer will do or if he will appear. The film centers on four main characters who end up having their careers be consumed by the Zodiac case: one is exhausted and transfers, one loses reputation, one becomes a drunk, and one becomes so obsessed as to neglect his family and job. All of the acting is great, I really love Ruffalo as the cop, but Gyllenhaal once again steals the show for me and elevates this movie to even greater heights. We see his puzzling, obsessive nature from the very start, and it's at once inspiring and heartbreaking to see him pursue the case relentlessly when everyone else gave up on it and thinks he's crazy. The third act is superb, as the tension rises and we see the case from the perspective of Graysmith. The basement scene was the tension peak for me, but the entire ending is just spot on. The single long look Graysmith gives in the shop is the most cathartic ending we could get. It's a long movie but doesn't drag for a second. The direction and performances are excellent, and there is plenty to consider from all perspectives: police, journalism, serial killer psychology, and society. I'll be overjoyed if I watch a better movie this year (looking at you Tenet).",Zodiac
214,danielmanson,Fantastic film.,8,31 May 2020,"Just want to start by saying that I thought that the performances were fantastic, especially from Mark Ruffalo and Jake Gyllenhaal.
The film itself was really interesting. As someone who knew only the absolute basics of the Zodiac story, this was informative, as well as well written and interesting. It's also a really good take on how much effort and how much concrete evidence you actually need on someone.If you know nothing about the Zodiac, or if you know a lot I think this film is perfect for both, because of how well it's done.",Zodiac
215,bbickley13-921-58664,I Really liked this movie,8,21 June 2014,"Zodiak is perfect. It was Dark, and horrifying, and dramatic all role into one.The fictional tale of the real events of The Zodiak killer has the the bay area police and a local newspaper go on the hunt for this man.The scenes with the actual Zodiac killer seem almost like a slasher film ironically because it felt like such a real situation. He kind of preps his victims and what seems like so suddenly he violently kills them. Fincher does very little to exaggerate the violence he just keeps you on the subject as it happens. less is more.Some top notch acting going on in the movie. From Jake Gyllenhaal as Robert Graysmith, the character whose story we follow throughout the film. to Chloë Sevigny as Melanie Graysmith who played a small but memorable role as Robert's second wife who he met and develop a relationship with in the over 10 year span he spent obsessing with the killer.The art direction was really good. i love a good period piece that can take me back to that time and place so well. The cinematography also made it fun to look at.It was a well played out story the could have gone wrong because of all the time that passes in the film, Fincher shows his mastery over the craft and his ability to handle so much going on in the film with the large ensemble cast.Definitely glad I saw it.",Zodiac
216,CinematicInceptions,"Impressive, but not much of a story.",7,9 April 2018,"This ranks in the lower half of the Fincher movies, both in my personal opinion and on IMDb's rating scale. It lacks some of the incisive commentary on society and human nature that are present in some of Fincher's other movies, and is set up as a crime thriller mystery. While it kept my attention for most of the duration, the ending left me a little bit empty because there wasn't much of a point to it that I could see. Now, since the movie is based on facts and the Zodiac killer was never caught or officially identified, I can't really complain about this. In truth, I think that Fincher and James Vanderbilt did a very good job adapting these events into a movie, but the story itself is not one that easily fits into a traditional narrative. The events take place over a number of years with large gaps in between events, which means that the movie has to kind of reset itself every twenty minutes or so, which slows things down. The nature of the case also requires the audience to remember a lot of specific details, again nobody's fault but it is a detractor. There are also a lot of minor characters and names to keep track of, which is a challenge if you watch the movie in one sitting and even more of a challenge if you watch it in more than one sitting.I seriously admire the work that went into this, because it was interesting to watch and had a lot of engaging scenes in it. But at its core, this is not a story so much as it is a sequence of separate events. There's no real cause and effect to string them together. Our main characters are pretty good and easy enough to root for in their own ways. This is helped in no small part by the fact that they are played by three great actors.If you're a Fincher fan like me because of his other works like Gone Girl, Fight Club, Se7en, and The Social Network, just be warned that this is less of that type of Fincher. It certainly looks and feels like a Fincher movie, though his dark lighting trademark got a little too dark sometimes here and made it difficult to see what was happening. However, it lacks the thematic depth of his other works and is not as engaging to watch. It is definitely dark in tone, but nowhere near as violent as Se7en, so its a relatively safe movie for viewers who don't like blood and gore. I was invested enough while watching it, but at the moment, I'm not that inclined to watch it again. Overall Rating: 7.2/10.",Zodiac

219,buiger,Not nearly as good as they say...,5,9 April 2010,"I beg to respectfully disagree with Ebert on this one (and for once, I seem to be in agreement with the Academy, which didn't even give this movie a single nomination). I tend to agree with Berardinelli's review, but I think he rated the movie far too high... I found this movie to be nothing more than average, not gripping at all, and far, far too long. This coming from someone who normally likes very long movies (none of my favorite films are shorter than two hours), but in order to sustain a long duration, you need plot, dialog, etc. In other words, you need quality... Unfortunately this film doesn't have it, or better, doesn't have nearly enough.Having said that, the film also has one major disadvantage, and that is the topic itself, it is totally anticlimactic. By the time this movie was made, almost everybody already knew the story of the Zodiac killer and its ending (or lack thereof), which takes away a large portion (if not all) of the suspense. Under such circumstances it is very difficult to make a movie that will keep the viewers' attention for 160 minutes...",Zodiac
220,ethanbresnett,Spectacular,9,3 September 2020,"I'm not one of those people who loves true crime documentaries and obsesses over serial killers, so I had no knowledge at all of the Zodiac murderer. All of this made Zodiac one hell of an experience for me. What a story. What a mystery. It was hard not to get dragged into Jake Gyllenhaal's labyrinth of clues and fall into the mystery of the Zodiac killer.As you'd expect from David Fincher taking on a serial killer, the film is dark, moody and stylish. All of his directorial trademarks are here in all their glory, and it may be one of his best from a technical perspective (it certainly warrants a place at the table in that discussion).What I found the film did so well was transcend time effortlessly and effectively. Taking place over decades, but focusing mostly on the late 60s/early 70s, there was a mammoth task facing Fincher in weaving together the sometimes disparate and loose threads that converge to create the Zodiac mystery. Its a testament to his skill as a filmmaker that this story was executed on screen without a hitch. As well as this, he made a two hour forty film absolutely fly by, with something to extract from every scene. The narrative could easily have got out of hand and felt confused, rushed or drawn out, but Fincher nailed the balance here.The film benefited from a very intriguing and captivating set of characters who were tremendously brought to life by a main cast of Jake Gyllenhaal, Robert Downey Jr and Mark Ruffalo. Their performances were made all the more impressive by the fact that they played characters over an extended period, all of whom experienced changing attitudes and relationships with the case of the Zodiac. Jake Gyllenhaal in particular deserves a nod here for his performance, which tied the film together and was the unifying thread for the viewer throughout.Zodiac is a very technically brilliant film, and also delivers so much intrigue, suspense and mystery. Its hard to tear your eyes away and not to be absolutely grossed in this superb retelling of a tantalising manhunt.Yet another spectacular film from the brilliant David Fincher.",Zodiac

Gosh, the story is absorbing audience very powerfully with quick descriptions on each killing and actors' concentration on their characters. 'Zodiac' is very practical because every scene is meant to be there to recount the story. There is no single scene to throw away. It is very fast paced and does not give any time to look away. Most importantly, the movie not only describes the case itself but also examines how that case impacted people around it, making the movie more interesting than real event. Paul Avery lives in a boat with booze all around; Sherwood gets fired; Toschi feels dejection from time to time; and Graysmith is too obsessed with the case to hold the family together. The latter part of this movie revolves around how these characters deal with this unfished project with passion or obsession or disappointment, and that is what makes this movie stand out.The audience can feel the ambiance of 70s, but how the director approaches this era is very modern. Camera angles are creative and various, providing many points of views toward this one event. Great work from thriller master, David Fincher.",Zodiac

It's that sort of mystery-complex, endless, with countless players and procedures to dissect, and the film with its excellent technique, turns, and script (the time jumps feel natural; the third-act lens shift to Graysmith works well; Avery's arc feels like it's cut short though) captures it all with a remarkable sense of cohesion (a couple loose threads along the way) and momentum.",Zodiac
224,BrnzReviews,This Is The Reviewer Speaking...,8,30 June 2021,"I've always been fascinated with the zodiac killers true story, its so intriguing how they never caught him. This film is amazing, i think everyone in this played their part down to the very detail, so many phenomenal peformances from the likes of Jake Gyllenhaal, Robert Downey JR, Mark Ruffalo all whom appear to be involved in the marvel universe which i thibk is also quite interesting and could be a reason why the chemistry in this film is so greater than we know, if we hadnt seen the movies. Jake Gyllenhaal is quite extroadonary, I've seen many of his movies and think hes very talented and alaays keeps me glued to my screen, this is a must watch!Its important to pay attention to detail in this movie as alot of things dont appear what they seem when it comes to the killings, one moment he will just outright kill but other times he's intelligent with hlw he plans it out, hes an intriguing character who also happens to exist in real life which is crazy.I highly recommend this movie, its a veru accurate detail of events that actually happened, everything you see is fact and thats what makes it entertaining and excellent.",Zodiac
225,gsygsy,unresolved,5,14 June 2007,"This is a movie based on a book about a series of crimes for which the perpetrator was never brought to justice. A cartoonist on a regional newspaper becomes obsessed with the case, to the detriment of aspects of his domestic life. Nothing is resolved. No easy answers.This is an interesting attempt by Fincher and his team to do something a little different in terms of mainstream thriller fare. And, episode by episode, the story is well-told and superbly acted - some of the very best of Hollywood's character actors are on hand, led by the perpetually excellent Jake Gyllenhaal.The trouble is, if nothing is resolved for the story's characters, then nothing is going to be resolved for the audience. Whether you think it's a good thing to be left with the same feeling of frustration as the protagonists will determine your enjoyment. Personally, I'm not sympathetic to works of art that point out, however tactfully, that they are fiction while at the same time doing everything possible to present ""real life"" on screen - no one in ZODIAC looks at the camera and says ""Hey you out there, it's only a movie!"" I only wish they had. It might have lifted the air of portentousness that hovers over too much of this project.",Zodiac
226,avik-basu1889,There's a killer on the road !!!!,10,26 November 2014,"Zodiac is based on the novel written by Robert Graysmith about the notorious ""Zodiac"" killer who went on a killing spree in and around the San Francisco Bay Area during the late 1960s and the early 1970s. Unlike Seven or Fight Club, Fincher adopted a very non-showy approach to tell the story in the overall sense, but his characteristic style is still visible in the look of many scenes throughout the movie.The script and the screenplay is like a labyrinth or a maze of evidence, documents, leads, red herrings and dead ends. Fincher aggressively puts us in the middle of the investigation and refuses to provide any relief from this never ending saga of relentless evidence analysis and exploration. Due to this, when the film ends you feel like you have been a part of the proceedings too. The film doesn't have any chases or too much gory violence. The murder scenes take place very early within the first 30 minutes,throughout the remaining portion, emphasis is placed on the nitty-gritty aspects of the evidence exploration. We follow Robert Graysmith(Gyllenhaal), Dave Toschi(Ruffalo) and Paul Avery(Downey Jr.) on the continuous pursuit of the Zodiac killer. Along with the real aspects of the investigation, the theme of the film is to show how the lives of investigators can get hugely affected by the harrowing aspect of being a part of such a long winded case which never seems to reach a satisfactory conclusion. It is more about the journey than the destination. Chasing a serial killer can lead to an obsession which is not much different than the obsession which engulfed that very serial killer in the first place and it can lead to complete deterioration of personal and professional lives.For a movie which is 2 hours 45 minutes long, it feels extremely enjoyable and never boring. Fincher avoids clichés that have perennially plagued the crime mystery genre. He expects the viewer to keep up with the plot. He never compromises by inserting any unnecessary action scenes. The cinematography like all Fincher films is great. The production design expertly recreates a look of the film very appropriate for the era to which the story belongs. The colour yellow plays a huge role in the visual context to convey the themes in the plot. Above all this film masterfully shows how even in a cop investigation thriller like this, closure can be achieved through means other than the hero shooting the villain in the end.Zodiac is a long film and requires some effort from the viewer while watching, but with the required amount of focus, this is a rewarding experience. The film is supremely re-watchable and the plot always feels addictive no matter how many times you have watched it before.",Zodiac
227,david-meldrum,A Study In Methodical Detection Under Mounting Pressure And Anxiety,9,29 October 2021,"Like some of his other work - think Mindhunter, The Social Network for example - revisiting this reminds me that Fincher's more concerned with process than incident, method than solution. There is little of the now customary prurience displayed towards the killer's victims. This is a film determined not to let us be interested in the killer himself for any reason other than catching him. It's all muted, subtle and understated - with the notable exception of Downey Jr who seems to be acting in a much hammier, showier film than everyone else. Other than him, the cast is superb; the writing maybe doesn't carry the weight the film deserves and other than victims or supporting partners, women are scarcely visible. But it's still Fincher close to or at his best - a patient study in people engaging in methodical detection in the context of slowly rising pressure and ever-mounting anxiety.",Zodiac
228,daniel-mannouch,Very Clear About the Pitfalls of True Crime Culture,7,10 December 2020,"Underwhelming at the box office, David Fincher's Zodiac is by far his most underrated film and is a fascinating take on California's more myth than man Zodiac Killer. True to form for Fincher, the confirmed killings of the Zodiac are reconstructed here with fetishistic detail. This is the first act, recalling the key events involving the Zodiac Killer between 1969 and 1974, and as absurd as things got, remember that this is all true and did happen and Fincher portrays it with utmost reverence and choice moments of black comedy.After these events, the story then focuses on Robert Graysmith played by Jake Gyllenhall, who would go on to write one of the definitive books on the Zodiac Killer. This is where Zodiac really comes into its own and does something not many films like it have done. It focuses on what the lack of conclusion to a murder case can do to those who have become closely involved with it. Or to put it more bluntly, a solid commentary on the trauma of no closure. The results are apparently paranoia and an arc of intrigue slowly malforming into obsession and Gyllenhall pulls this one off really, really well. All the actors are good really apart from Robert Downey Jr who is just playing Robert Downey Jr and that was distracting.What else can i say about 2007's Zodiac, apart from that it's not 1971's The Zodiac Killer, as well as that it has fantastic cinematography, insane amounts of detail in the art direction and miraculously keeps your attention focused for all of it's near three hours of running time. It's a fantastic film and i highly recommend it.",Zodiac
229,skybrick736,Zodiac,9,12 May 2015,"One of the few extraordinary, gifted directors continuing to make quality films is David Fincher. The man knows how to piece a story together and make long periods of dialog interesting. Watching Zodiac, I was so drawn into it that I really felt like wanting to solve a murder mystery. I can understand why Robert Graysmith dedicated his life to searching out the truth of the Zodiac killings. The initial kills are horrific and hooks the audience immediately, which leads to the chase. Just watching the film I knew the story had to be historically accurate because it seemed like I was listening into private conversations that happened years ago. The trio of stars, Jake Gyllenhaal, Robert Downey Jr., and Mark Ruffalo were superb characters and likable. The film is very long but worth the watch if your patient enough to watch an amazing truthful story about a serial killer. Not enough do we get a high budget accurate representation of real-life killers. Zodiac (9/10) is a sleeping gym that I recommend to all.",Zodiac
230,Lebowskidoo,Intensity!,10,27 May 2019,"Very few movies have ever made me feel true horror, but this is one of them.Our world is a scary place sometimes, kids.

Just stupendous moviemaking. Not for the faint of heart.",Zodiac
231,dead47548,Fincher's best since Se7en.,8,9 January 2008,"Personally, I find David Fincher to be an overrated director who aims his films at every teenage boy trying to look totally awesome because he can quote Fight Club, but I all admit that I'm a pretty big fan of his wonderful thriller, Se7en. Since he created that unnerving, psychological journey in 1995 all I've seen from him has been one mediocre formulaic thriller after the other with the complete disgrace that was Fight Club in the middle. Zodiac is a much more adult film for Fincher, and it's easily his best since Se7en and the second entry to his resume that I can honestly say I admire. The story of the infamous serial killer has always been one of great interest to me; I first discovered it years ago and read Robert Graysmith's book that the film is based on a few years ago. Fincher does this disturbing, extremely mysterious story justice by creating an adult thriller that covers every big element of the still-open investigation that has spanned decades.In order to capture everything without making a ten hour production, he was forced to jump across extremely different amounts of time (from as little as ten hours to as long as four years). Surprisingly, he does this with great skill and the film never manages to drag or distract due to this gaps in time. It's a taut, unnerving tale that thoroughly studies the mystery of the Zodiac killer and shows the effect that this case takes on three very different men. A charismatic, witty reporter who eventually gets threats on his life (Robert Downey Jr.), a young cartoonist who takes the investigation under his wing once everyone else has all but given up (Jake Gyllenhaal) and the head detective who is destroyed by the case and even gets accused of forging letters from the Zodiac in order to boost his own fame (Mark Ruffalo). All three performances are excellent, but Downey and Ruffalo really amazed me. They are two of my favorite actors and they still manage to catch me off guard by how outstanding their portrayals are.",Zodiac
232,charchuk,Expertly directed,10,23 March 2007,"Incredibly stylish and fantastically directed, this is not Fincher's best only because Fight Club and Se7en are modern classics. It runs a bit long, but certainly doesn't feel two and a half hours, and is fully deserving of its length. It's basically two investigations in one, but it doesn't feel redundant because each character investigates different suspects and different aspects. The transition between the two halves stumbles a bit, but it soon regains form and leads into a great finish. The first half hour or so, basically just introducing the case, is terrific without much character development, but once the characters take over it's a whole other ballgame. As I said before, the only misstep is in the middle, but it's smooth sailing the rest of the way.The cast ensemble is terrific with Downey Jr. clearly standing out, but Ruffalo, Gyllenhaal and Anthony Edwards (with hair!) are great also. The supporting players, consisting of many character actors, are somewhat underused but just make the cast all the better. I'd love for Downey Jr. to get some Oscar attention - he should have more than just the one nomination - but I wonder if the film is too early in the year. Still, his performance is fantastic - hilarious yet depressing at the same time. He really drives the beginning of the film, and it's too bad that he just fades away in the last half.Fincher is rapidly becoming one of my favourite directors, with this, the aforementioned classics, and the underrated The Game all under his belt now. The way that pivotal scenes in this film are staged and shot only add to the brilliance of the flick, and make certain moments truly terrifying. From the opening shot, basically a tracking shot from within a car, the cinematography never falters, and scenes like the cab ride, the beach attack, and the time-elapse building are just highlights in a incredibly well-directed film.It's not a perfect film, but the style is so innovative and the story so involving that it's pretty close. Perhaps some of it could have been edited down, but I really felt like it needed the lengthy running time to completely tell the story of the Zodiac. A great start to the year and a film that's likely to be in my top five at year's end.",Zodiac
233,EthanBJones_03,Great true story; Worth a watch if you're willing to concentrate,8,17 December 2016,"Overall: The movie is actually very good and well done only if you're willing to concentrate for just under 3 hours.Good: The story is very interesting with immeasurable tension brought from a fascinating real life event. The music is very well done and beats with every emotion. Every single actor did a great job and drew me into the story making me forget who they were. The dialogue was great as was the phenomenal cinematography. I like the short bursts of humour which break up the tense moments.Bad: There were a few pacing issues and, in my opinion, too many characters. I understand they had to be accurate but there were at least 40-45 characters who were critical to the story. It was needlessly long and could have been cut down so it felt like less of a drag. You need to concentrate to understand it and that will lesser the viewing experience of some people. Best Part: The basement scene involving Jake Gyllenhaal.MVP: Robert Downey Jr as Paul Avery8/10",Zodiac
234,rooee,Machinations of a Mystery,4,8 September 2010,"Zodiac tells the story - and every wild goose chase in-between - of the hopeless, hapless search for a blundering killer in 1970s San Francisco. Jake Gyllenhaal plays the obsessive newspaper artist Robert Grayson, an internet geek for a pre-internet age. Once you're locked into the rhythm of Zodiac's short, dense scenes, throbbing like a steady heartbeat, you're kind of mesmerised. But ultimately it's an experience as maddening, detailed, demanding and repetitive as the obsession it depicts. 160 minutes is a long time to be locked in a labyrinth from which there may be no escape. Zodiac really is devoted to its story. However, its determination not to stray from the evidence means that the domestic and inter-cop conflicts come across as mechanised. Chloe Sevigny plays the wife to Gyllenhaal's hair-tearing sleuth - but she plays it with flat indifference, so one is never convinced that she truly wants to drag Graysmith away from his books, least of all Mr Fincher. Ruffalo delivers the film's (and his personal) best performance. As professionalism gives way to disillusionment, and then morphs into frustration and finally ambivalence, his detective inspector is the struggle at the centre of the mystery, while colleagues drop out and cartoonists plunge yet deeper. The film's aesthetic is largely handsome and static, occasionally interrupted by virtuoso aerial pans and tracks, as if Fincher wants to position the story as lost in a city of stories (a point made rather more concisely in Psycho's opening shot). A late scene in a shadowy basement stands apart from all that preceded it as an incongruous slice of horror melodrama. After a movie as cold and methodical as Zodiac, perhaps it's no surprise that director David Fincher followed it up with something as saccharine and fuzzy as Benjamin Button.",Zodiac
235,Marc_Israel_365,A stale magic trick,7,21 May 2014,"Whether or not you are familiar with the history and facts of Zodiac, you watch a movie for some sense of entertainment. Director David Fincher manages to squeeze some out of the mystery and bringing you through the different stages of what happens when an obsession become unfulfilled or mentally and physically harmful. It's shown to be a long process for those either charged with catching, reporting or simply solving a puzzle that no one else can. Living through a similar widespread panic as a set of snipers was on attack in my D.C. suburbia in 2002, I can attest that the trap catches many per news coverage and self preservation, while others are touched directly by the events. You collect every fact that you can to make sense of it all. That is the heart of the film. ""The Conversation"" holds a similar viewpoint and, I'd imagine, has a similar set of fans among them. The actors bring you into their characters, but nobody shines here, mostly due to the fact that their characters aren't built that way. Ruffalo takes on the task of starting an investigation way after other evidence has been disseminated and never can put it together, plagued by his desired obligation. Our SF Chronicle writer, played by Downey, Jr., makes it about himself as he falls into self absorbed alcoholism, while we follow our cartoonist turned puzzle solver, played by Gyllenhaal, who is as wide opened naive at times as he is smart and obsessed, but it never seems to come together for him. It's a long watch with a lot of attempts to make the time in between ""action"" entertaining and I'm not all aboard in that perspective. Based on true story movies start their magic trick with their hands tied and may escape the perceived peril, but will the crowd applaud in amazement of entertainment or out of an audiences' duty?",Zodiac

237,richard_sleboe,Catch him if you can,7,18 June 2007,"Zodiac starts out as a shimmering string of Gregory Crewdson style shots, set to the eerie harmonies of Donovan's Hurdy Gurdy Man. But it mutates twice: first into a strangely hands-off mystery with a clumsy cartoonist as the head investigator, and finally into a tale of obsession. As a result, it's barely short of three hours, but I guess that's what it takes to show the characters' development. Both star journalist Paul Avery (Robert Downey Jr.) and his faithful apprentice Robert (Jake Gyllenhall) go to pieces over the case, but in different ways: where Paul turns to the bottle, Robert's manic compulsion to find the killer gets him within two inches of doom. Think ""The Number 23"", but with less action, better acting and way more visual discipline. Very notable guest appearances by John C Lynch (Norm Gunderson in ""Fargo"") as the prime suspect, Adam Goldberg (don't miss him in ""2 Days in Paris"") as a gruffy editorial newcomer, and the amazing Clea DuVall (""Identity"") as a highly principled prison inmate.",Zodiac
238,dilbertsuperman,Fantastic film- great conspiracy theories- it feels like watching a 70s flick. great cars too.,9,17 October 2007,"What a welcome relief the style of this film is. No shaky cameras no sweep shots that give you epileptic seizures or stupid chase scenes- no big stupid club you over the head Danny Elfman themes screaming in your ear to try and give you drama and tension where there is none- this is a big long cerebral suspense thriller - a game of chess with California as the chessboard and the stakes are people's lives. Very fascinating but you have to like detective whodunnit kind of stuff. Lot's of beautiful old style cars in this film as well.THE PLOT: Based on a true story of a killer(s) that dumbfounded and taunted police through the newspaper in a quest for the natural born killer style of publicity for their heinous crimes. A man who calls himself the ZODIAC is going around killing people to appease some sort of sick compulsion. He sends letters that are completely encrypted in symbols and have to be decoded to be understood. Like most sociopathic killers he considers himself smarter than 90% of the population and wants to kill indiscrimnately until he meets a worthy opponent. The conspiracy theories run wild and a couple of men from the newspaper become obsessed with the story while a handful of cops do the same- this movie chronicles in great detail the steps to trying to track this man down.*****SPOILER ALERT*******Don't read any further unless you have seen this movie already........... SPOILER: It's my theory- based on the scene with Robert Graysmith interviewing the man who made the posters, and whose handwriting matched the zodiac letters, and who had a basement- that it was a team of two or more men, Lee AND the poster maker, who originally were working for a group of upper class elites(inspired by the most dangerous game) to capture people for a club of rich upper class sociopathic killers who enjoy killing the lower classes- all based on the movie the most dangerous game. When the muscle that kidnapped people for this club went rogue - Lee and his team mate then became the zodiac killer so that they could enjoy what they were taking all the risk for previously- for the club that same club eventually had the biggest link back to them - Lee, snuffed out before he could be taken in to custody with a very convenient heart attack.I would be shocked if the guy who made the movie posters has not met an untimely accident as well.There's several men involved with the Zodiac killings, and they were much smarter than any cop. once they went rogue and became public killers instead of just kidnappers - They covered their tracks by continuously and premeditatedly planting evidence that led in the wrong direction to the right man, for the wrong crime, and thus exonerating him from further investigation. For instance- Lee kills a person but then plants evidence pointing to someone else he is working with- who has also killed people in the zodiac style and is part of the zodiac team, but not for this particular homicide. The evidence doesn't match and they give up on that guy being the killer because they never stop to think- it's killers- plural- not one man. Remember- the zodiac has twelve gates- that number may not relate only to the victims- it may relate to the killer's club members as well. There could be a killer that is allowed to kill during a certain month if his chart reads favorably. The rest of the club covers his tracks with disinformation and planted evidence.I think the level of invincibility this team felt in their contracted kidnappings for this hunting club caused them to lose control and go rogue so that they could have the fun of killing the people too- and they then became the zodiac killer. I think police should investigate missing person reports that happened before the zodiac killings- but match the Zodiac MO minus the letters to the newspaper. Those killings would have been when they were working for the real killers- and who may still be at large and active.Clever. clever.",Zodiac
239,Mike_Devine,The quintessential Fincher crime thriller,7,20 October 2020,"David Fincher's signature filmmaking style is what sets 'Zodiac' apart from the average crime thriller. The journey back to the 60s to watch the cat-and-mouse chase between journalists, detectives and an evasive serial killer is one that is both unsettling and enthralling, as we see evidence slowly pieced together over the course of many years.Aside from the source material, which is rich, the acting performances are what make 'Zodiac' what it is. From Jake Gyllenhaal's San Francisco Chronicle cartoonist-turned-amateur detective to RDJ's eccentric beat reporter (a pre-Tony Stark RDJ, at that) and Mark Ruffalo's self-defeatist SFPD inspector, we get to follow the psychological impact of an incredibly difficult case, which plays mind tricks on each of our main characters in different ways.While top-tier acting is a crucial element of 'Zodiac,' a lot of its strength comes from the way it's filmed. Scenes that feature illuminating information that cause a shift in direction, or perspective, are plenty - some of which are enough to send chills down your spine. The soundtrack is also responsible for upping the chill factor.'Zodiac' is an example of a well-done take on a ripped-from-the-headlines story that still feels fresh and new.",Zodiac

There's moments of almost slapstick violence which are slightly world breaking but those are forgotten in moments of pure tension which occur in the later stages of the film, creating elements of total horror the film is an extremely satisfying watch that's well worth your time (even if it's well over 2 hours)",Zodiac
242,nobbytatoes,Fincher's craft maturing,8,17 May 2007,"The release of a David Fincher film is a time to celebrate. Fincher has staked out an impressive claim as a director, with only a handful of films in his cannon, a few already cemented in cult and contemporary classic status. Zodiac feels a long time coming, five years between Zodiac and Panic Room; his longest gap, yet a gap that shows Fincher has grown as a film maker. Returning to the detective/crime genre, a genre Fincher redefined with Seven over a decade ago, Zodiac is by no means another Seven, stripping off controversial, heavy subject matter or Seven or Fight Club, or the free roaming camera work of Panic Room, for Zodiac see's Fincher with his most restrained and mature piece of work.The Zodiac killings in San Fransico' is one of great unsolved cases, numerous suspects; namely Arthur Leigh Allen, with no conviction ever place upon anyone. Zodiac based upon Robert Graysmith's novel, follows Graysmith, a cartoonist for the San Fransico Chronicle newspaper, Inspector David Toschi and Paul Avery, a crime journalist for the Chronicle, three men who were the most affected by the Zodiac investigation. For an un-shut case, Fincher with James Vanderbilt's screenplay, wring every note of tension, with bated breathlessness, from the eerie opening scenes, to an ending that dwindles into thrilling nothingness. The dramatic exhale Fincher builds to never arrives, for credit to his craft as a film maker, makes Zodiac compelling viewing for a film that reaches no real conclusion. Set around the case and the investigation, Zodiac explores the obsession, turmoil and sheer pain caused from the investigation spanning decades. Harris Savides's cinematography is classically captured with still H-D cameras, bronzed out nights, information lined everywhere, capturing the time period with precession.The actual killer of the piece, is actually not the main story arc. After witnessing the murder of a young couple, with a few more to witness soon after, Zodiac focuses more on Graysmith, Toschi and Avery, who become entangled with this investigation; unwillingly or compelled to uncover the murderer. The most affected is Graysmith, his obsessive urge to solve the investigation, at times when no one else will. Constantly hitting dead ends, the audience along with Graysmith, sift the never ending clues and leads, heading to nowhere. To Zodiac's conclusion, you can feel Fincher is smiling over the fact that nothing is resolved in the end.Pushing nothing but perfection out of the cast, all actors deliver performances at the top of their game. Jake Gyllenhaal as Robert Graysmith, Robert Downey Jr. as Paul Avery and Mark Ruffalo as Inspector David Toschi are nothing short of brilliant. Surroundded by an impressive supporting cast, all give amazing performances; most notedly by Anthony Edwards as Inspector William Armstrong, Brian Cox cameo as Melvin Belli and John Carroll Lynch as suspect Arthur Leigh Allen.Zodiac is David Fincher's most muted and mature film, evolving in his craft. It may not be the controversial slice of cinema many might be expecting, though like Fincher's previous films, Zodiac is compulsory viewing.",Zodiac

244,eagandersongil,The instigating unknown,8,3 December 2017,"The mix of rhythm, script, acting and photography. ""Zodiáco"" is another film by David Fincher that is not perfect, but also does not sin, approaching the story of a curious serial Killer, the film mixes nuclei and points of view, with many details, tension and a good direction, all this makes ""Zodiáco"" one of the best films of the American director. With more than two hours and socks of duration the script can not be dropped into monotony, and even when the same is repeated in ideas, is saved by the great performances, telling the story of a serial Killer that ravaged California during the 1960s and 70, the film little develops the killer because, it was never discovered that it really was, so we have a concentration in a journalistic nucleus and a police officer, the latter to support the first, and running out, we have a nucleus with more poetic freedom, which in the case, is the murderer, the script, even if one repeats ideas at times, has a spectacular rhythm, in addition to telling an extremely instigating story in an even more instigating way, through speculation, all 4 characters that involve the two core cores are well developed, in terms of script the work is not perfect, but it is well above average. The film flees in talking about some social issues in the middle of the way, like racism for example, does not end up not going that way, which is not bad, since it is difficult to focus on something other than ""Zodiaco "", with a palette of gray but clear colors, the film transmits very well the 60s and 70s, in addition to centered camera angles, and always using plane against plane, the film direction is very good, the subjective camera is little used , but we have beautiful open plans, as well as a positioning in closed spaces that always goes through a ""Sinister"" climate. With a trio of actors that would come a few years later become synonymous of quality in the cinema, the performances are great and follow the whole.

I was a little skeptical because I usually get a little annoyed with movies that are over two hours but this one kept my attention the entire time.The director of Se7en, David Fincher, also directs this one and I would go as far as saying that it's just as good as Se7en. Jake Gyllenhaal, Mark Ruffalo, and Robert Downey Jr. are all astounding in their roles but I guess that's to be expected from these great actors. The story sticks very well to the original accounts and the murders are gruesome and brilliantly done.

The music, the way it's shot, the way that Fincher sets up every scene is breathtaking and entirely gripping and original. He sinks you into this experience and you just go along the whole way. He grabs you and makes you feel all of the sensations he wants you to feel. But one of the ways it's perfect is through all of it's imperfections. It skips years at a time, it never comes to a complete conclusion, it doesn't give it's audience a firm ending so they can go home and sleep properly at night.It's a thriller in the broadest of terms, but it moves so slowly and patiently. You slowly become obsessed and when the film is ended you are frustrated by the lack of a solid conclusion and the fact that you'll never know the solid truth, but that's the truth of life sometimes and Fincher boldly takes you to that place. David Fincher broke ground as a filmmaker with Seven, which is in my eyes the perfect American crime thriller, in the way that it plays almost everything in a standard way (until the final act, at least) but everything is done perfectly with a lot of great commentary on society. So when you come into another Fincher crime thriller (especially about another serial killer), you expect this feature that is immediately gripping and filled with blood and action the way that Seven was, but he defies expectation at every turn here.Zodiac is not this fast-paced action-drenched thriller, it's so patient and calculated. The way it requires the audience to just be involved in it and then leaves it hanging is so breathtakingly refreshing and completely sticks with you. The accuracy in the way it approaches the case and the time period (the art direction is miraculous) is marvelous if you stop and pay attention, but it's impossible to stop long enough when the plot pulls you in so well. This is a perfect movie, made even more so by all of the ways that it's not ""perfect"". As he has shown many times in films like The Curious Case of Benjamin Button and The Social Network, Fincher can make anything cinematic (even the most mundane moments, as he demonstrated in the latter) but here he scales back the tide.He could have done these murder scenes in the most cinematic ways but he plays them quiet and he could play almost any scene in a very standard cinematic way that we are used to in Hollywood, but he goes the totally opposite way. He plays them patiently and sly, keeping the audience on it's toes and constantly playing with their perception. This could have easily been a horror film with gore and a bunch of jumps, but instead he (and writer James Vanderbilt) makes it this calculated mystery and study of obsession and the true nature of crime in America.People use horror films to escape and get enjoyment out of watching people get cut apart, but Fincher doesn't let you enjoy anything here. You see these horrific sequences and they feel so real and you recognize that even though something like this will probably never happen to you, it could. Fincher has created something that will live on as one of the masterpieces of American cinema and for my money it's the best of his career to this point.",Zodiac
248,gary-444,Worthy But Turgid,4,28 May 2007,"Fincher is one of the best directors around at the moment. His credentials include Alien 3, Fight Club, Seven, Panic Room and the massively under rated The Game. Stylistically, and technically, the film is fine. But by his own high standards it is a dramatic failure.The opening third of a long 2 hour 49 min running time shows him at his best. The violence is shocking, malevolent and unsettling with the audience sharing the bewilderment of the time. Whio is the killer ? Why is he doing this? What are the links ? When is he going o strike next? Then the problems start.Essentally this is the story of Grayson the cartoonist turned author and his quest to unmask the Zodiac killer. But this takes over twenty years, the contact from Zodiac is episodic, and the genuine killings all take place at the front end of the picture.Grayson does have a complex story to tell - and Fincher tells it. But ultimately in so doing he kills the dramatic tension of the tale. A journalistic maxim is ""never let the facts get in the way of a good story"" and this applies here.The labyrinthine detective work begins to collapse under its own investigative weight leaving space really only for devoted ""Zodiacphiles"" but not the standard cinema goer.Surprisingly Fincher chooses to pass on two of the most dramatic moments of the story. The moment when two patrol car officers pass the Zodiac killer after he has slain the taxi driver is recounted but not portrayed, and the heart attack death of the prime suspect is told by post film postscript ! The soundtrack is wonderful ""Hurdy Gurdy Man"", Santana et al, as is the acting and dialogue.But ultimately an intriguing story does not necessarily make a great film, as is evidenced here.",Zodiac
249,bobbobwhite,I'll never buy another 3 cent stamp again!,8,6 March 2007,"Anyone who gets the relevance of the above statement to one of the characters in Zodiac can continue reading. All others please go away. Just kidding, but John Carroll Lynch, who played the hulking and probable Zodiac murderer here also played Norm, the barely-above-comatose husband of police chief Marge Gunderson(Frances McDormond) in the great movie Fargo, and in Fargo he played the winning artist of the federal 3 cent stamp competition. How much better does life get than winning that, I ask you? Anyway, he graduated to playing the ominous serial killer here, but that fact was unproved technically(but proved well enough for me). Lynch is a very good character actor seen often on film and TV in widely diverse roles, even cops.Good film, a little long in story development, and tedious in the obsessive Graysmith part(J. Gyllenhaal)from the midpoint on, as to me he was the least interesting one of the 3 main characters hunting or writing about Mr. Z. The main case cop Dave Toschi(Mark Ruffalo), and ace crime reporter Paul DeVry(the very terrific Robert Downey, Jr. here)were much more interesting, if not as zealous in their very long term pursuit of the Z as was the fanatical and never-say-die Graysmith, a cartoonist for the SF Chronicle(which of course made him imminently qualified to research and write a book on the Zodiac murders....Not!) I am not making this up, folks, as we all know that truth is stranger than fiction, and especially where the Zodiac was concerned all bets were off. I live in the SF Bay Area and know how off-the-wall the SFChron can be at times, so putting a cartoonist on the case may not be too unusual for the Chron.Well acted film overall in a good story, with Gyllenhaal seeming a bit of a weenie in his Graysmith role. He was portrayed as soft and sensitive but a real bulldog with a bone when it came to finding out who Z really was, and he never quit until the job was finished, for me, but again, not technically and legally. This horrible case ruined, or nearly ruined the careers and health of all 3 of these men, and the film showed that harsh deterioration well also.Great inside view of police work, OK, police work Hollywood style, but it was interesting to see the many official gears working to solve crimes even if it wasn't that scary/exciting, except when the Z was doing his dirty work.Great old '60's SF locations too; interesting to relive how our office workplaces used to look before high tech and computers took over everything.People loving good crime stories will like this film, but others wanting more action may be a bit bored as it is a very long film with lots of suspense but little action.",Zodiac

251,x_manicure_x,For cinephiles,6,14 August 2021,"""Zodiac"" is about how three people obsessed with hunting a killer ended up compromising their lives and careers. As the poster suggests, ""there's more than one way to lose your life to a killer."" The characters keep hitting dead ends as facts and evidence get blurred out by the flow of time, the interference of media and the obstructions of law procedures. It feels like a character development-centered thriller at first, but it slowly turns into a drawn-out, tediously verbose documentary the Zodiac killer investigation and the making of Robert Graysmith's book.Davi Toschi and Paul Avery fall out of scope halfway and, despite the demanding 2.5-hour running time, the film doesn't even bother to show you their aftermath. It's all abruptly resolved with some text before the credits.David Fincher shows high competence behind the camera, but we are far from anything entertaining here. I understand that you want to stick to facts with this kind of biopics, and that excessive dramatization can lead to embarrassing results. Still, this is not the kind of film I was looking for. As many mentioned, the basement scene was pretty cool though.",Zodiac
252,Quicksand,Fincher vs. the Police Procedural,9,3 March 2007,"Few directors have name recognition these days, and even fewer directed their first film in or after the Clinton administration. But David Fincher is a household name in some circles, his visual style in unmistakable and unequalled, and some might say, he can do no wrong.The biggest problem with ""Zodiac"" is that if it were a book (and it is), it would be in the True Crime section of you local bookstore. Books of this type sell very well, but I've never been a big fan. This film is essentially a police procedural, with not one protagonist but two-- Jake Gyllenhaal's Robert Graysmith disappears for huge stretches as the story focuses on Mark Ruffalo's Inspector Toschi, and his attempts (with Anthony Edwards' Inspector Armstrong) to track down the titular killer. Is it riveting to watch? Absolutely. Is Fincher's visual style evident in every frame? I think so, yes... you can't look away. Early in the film, Ruffalo looks out at late 1960's San Francisco, as a fire truck drives down the street toward him. Everything behind Ruffalo is 100% computer generated, and it's as gorgeous as anything to come out of that era of film-making. The attention to detail is mesmerizing.The question for the story is, would I watch it again? Probably not, but you can't have everything. ""Fight Club,"" ""The Game,"" ""Panic Room"" are films I own and can watch over and over. ""Alien3"" and ""Se7en"" every once in a while. ""Zodiac"" is a fictionalized story from a non-fiction book, and though the human element is what pulls you in throughout the film, and the characters are all people I was fascinated to hang out with for nearly 3 hours... the story is still what it is, and while well-told, doesn't reveal anything new. Bonus points for style and some outstanding casting, but as for rewatchability... I'm not so sure. Time will tell.",Zodiac
253,come2whereimfrom,Zodiac falls flat.,5,24 May 2007,"According to the poster this is 'Fincher's best film since Se7en' well they must have just forgotten a little known film called 'Fight Club' which in my opinion is a great movie and the last good film he made and after seeing Zodiac I haven't changed my mind. Long, too long and quite boring, there is no real story here, you never get the sense that they are after the killer hot on his heels like you did with Se7en and there is none of the visual flair that made 'Fight Club', 'Panic Room' and essentially Fincher a force to be reckoned with as a director. Instead you get Downey Jnr (Camping it up), Ruffalo (under-used) and Gyllenhaal (bumbling eye candy) all taking it in turns to get caught up in the muddling puzzle of the Zodiac killer. One of the troubles is the puzzles they are very exclusive to the cast, we as an audience are not really asked to do anything, solve anything or really even think, all we get to do is sit (for two and a half hours!) and watch these characters become obsessed and fall apart. Its not very exciting viewing I'm afraid, unless you're on of the many girls I've spoken to who liked it because they got to watch Gyllenhaal for that length of time then there's really nothing to it. The fact that it's a true story and they didn't catch the killer means there also no real ending either and the film just falls flat. The only glimmer of the old Fincher is in a scene where he overlays letters and puzzles from the killer over a montage of the films main players going about their business, its good but not enough. Don't get me wrong I wasn't expecting a 'Se7en' style film but I would have like to have had some characters I could care about and story that kept my interest especially at that length, but it just jumps from one place to another and at one point four years to when Gyllenhaal's character is married with three kids, frankly I'm surprised he had the time maybe his wife proposed in a cryptic note? Ultimately this is a bit of a let down from a director who showed so much early promise and vision only to go on to make straight forward and unchallenging movies. Here hoping his next project returns to former glories.",Zodiac
254,ExpendableMan,"I left my heart (and my sanity, marriage, career and social life) in San Francisco",8,1 January 2008,"Sometimes getting the best out of a film depends entirely on what setting you watch it in. Sit down on a Friday night with five of your mates after a paintball game, a fridge filled with beer and nine boxes of pizza on the coffee table and it's a dead cert that you will not enjoy Zodiac. It would seem too long, too talk-heavy and too dark and after less than an hour, the DVD would go sailing out of the machine and replaced with Blade 2. However, if you watch it alone at night with nobody else in the house, all the lights turned off and your phone switched off and you'll be in exactly the right place to appreciate it fully. And what an experience it is. Zodiac, while not the greatest film in director David Fincher's back catalogue (this is the man that directed Fight Club after all) is like a twenty-first century version of a classic film noir. The lighting is grim, the story slow paced, the male-centric cast obsessive and paranoid and by the time the deliberately ambiguous ending rolls around, your eyes will be gaping wide and you'll be lucky to sleep for a week.Based around the true life Zodiac case the film marks Fincher's return to the serial killer genre he previously did so memorably with Seven. No surprise then that there's a fair bit of expectation resting on it and your response to the movie inevitably depends on how familiar you are with his previous work. For one thing, the murders in this movie are not gory set pieces designed to get the blood hounds hot under the collar, but chillingly executed scenes of real-world horror. The pre-credits attack for instance is pure Fincher; awkward sexual tension hanging in the air as a young couple meet up for an illicit affair only to be stalked and set upon by a shadowy assailant who subsequently vanishes into thin air. Later this scene is echoed as a middle aged married couple are viciously slaughtered while lounging by a lake in broad daylight. Both sequences are tense and slow paced and the director's refusal to make them overly melodramatic adds to the sense of genuine brutality.Furthermore, Zodiac is one of the darkest films released last year and even scenes that take place in daylight have the oppressive feel of shadows moving in. While the investigation into the killer takes up a lot of the running time, the story is mainly focused on how three different lives are affected by the murders. Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhall) is a newspaper cartoonist whose natural skill at code breaking and problem solving suckers him in when Zodiac starts sending cryptic messages to the San Francisco Chronicle. Paul Avery (Robert Downey Jr.) is one of the paper's most respected journalists who takes a very intense interest in the case. David Toschi (Mark Ruffalo) is the chief police inspector hunting the killer. Each one becomes affected in their own way as the story unfolds and before long, their private obsessions see marriages destroyed and careers ended, their day to day actions haunted by a constant sensation of hooded eyes watching their every move.Naturally, as this is all based on a genuine story there is an added dimension to it and to his eternal credit, Fincher hasn't backed down from his vision in order to please the studios. However, it also means that the killer's identity is never fully revealed, a fact that some will find incredibly brave but others will be frustrated by, especially after the bladder-challenging three hour running time. Of course the director couldn't come out and say clearly who it was but he makes it clear who he believes was responsible and one of the final scenes where Graysmith confronts the suspect with neither man saying more than a few words or indeed, doing anything about it is a classic example of how a few minutes of silence can speak volumes.Zodiac therefore is a film that rewards patience. It stretches on and on but every second is infused with detail and depth. For anyone with a serious interest in cinema as an art form, this one isn't to be missed but even those of you who are rolling your eyes thinking ""pretentious sod"" will find much it a rewarding experience, just be sure to book an entire evening off first as this isn't the kind of film you can just put on on a whim.",Zodiac

1. The directing and framing of shots are incredibly impressive, and they're definitely the best I've seen from a David Fincher (Director) movie.
2. The dark lighting perfectly bathes the film in a brooding and gritty atmosphere.
3. The tension and suspense is masterfully built-up via the lighting, and the intermittent usage of the score mixed in with purposefully dense silences.
4. The score helps to ram home a nerve-wracking feel, which keeps you on edge through the entire experience.
5. The costume design is fantastic, and mirrors the time period, irrespective of whether it be the '60s, '70s, and even the short snippets of the '80s, and '90s.
6. The comedy is appropriately used sporadically, but is genuinely funny and it prevents the movie from becoming too depressive and heavy.
7. The inquiry scene between Bob Vaughn (Charles Fleischer) and Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal) is utterly captivating, and is one of the most nervy scenes in cinema that I have ever seen.
8. The flashing up of times and dates gives the film a strict structure, which is desperately needed due to the substance of the plot.
9. Charles Fleischer, Jake Gyllenhaal, Mark Ruffalo (Inspector David Toschi), and Robert Downey Jr. (Paul Avery) all deliver brilliant performances.Cons:
1. During the middle of the movie, the pacing slows down a little, especially as the Zodiac Killer becomes a secondary character.
2. Robert Graysmith has weak motivations for pursuing the identity of the Zodiac Killer, and when asked about his motivations, he just spurts out empty words, like: 'I just have to know who he is.'",Zodiac

The killer calls the police, saying that he killed them, and also confessing to the double murder of a young couple the Christmas before. This is only the beginning of a series of murders, coded messages and mysterious letters from a serial killer who calls himself 'Zodiac'. An odyssey that will bring top reporter Paul Avery (Robert Downey Jr.) to alcoholism and an early death at 60, detective Bill Armstrong (Anthony Edwards) to the decision of leaving the SFPD Homicide Unit, his partner Dave Toschi (Mark Ruffalo), assigned to the case with him to end up demoted and will become cartoonist Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal)'s obsession, making him neglect his wife (Chloe Sevigny), but ultimately leading to him finding out who the killer actually is (at least according to him); a man who was considered a suspect and then dismissed, Arthur Leigh Allen (John Carroll Lynch).Based on the autobiographic book by Robert Graysmith, David Fincher creates an intense and enjoyable (if a little sagging in some places) movie that manages to be a tense and scary thriller in the first part, and then suddenly shifting focus from the now-inoffensive (or is he?) Zodiac to Graysmith and his single-minded pursue.This is due not only to the appropriate direction by Mr. Fincher, but also by the fine thespians assembled, almost a who's who of the best male actors (and the lone female Sevigny) (Ruffalo, Gyllenhaal and especially Edwards stand out), the good writing by James Vanderbilt, the style, the cinematography and the accuracy in recreating everything faithfully, especially the murders.I also liked the idea of having the first victim, Mike Mageau, be both the first (played by Lee Norris) and the last (played by Jimmi Simpson) character to be seen in the movie.Zodiac: 8/10.",Zodiac

The screenplay is written by James Vanderbilt, based on the 1986 non-fiction book of the same name.Jake Gyllenhaal powerfully portrays Robert Graysmith, a mild-mannered political cartoonist whose life unravels as his paranoid quest to track down clues about the Zodiac killer. He uses his puzzle-solving abilities to get closer to revealing the identity of the killer.Zodiac is a film that really takes its time, but does a masterful job of showing how these killings didn't just destroy the lives of the victims and their families, but how the case became a burden to almost everyone involved. The picture is not just a masterclass in film-making and storytelling, it's proof that a horror movie does not have to be showy to be scary. The first half of the movie plays like a police procedural... It's a thrilling whirlwind of facts and dead ends and terrifying attacks that increasingly adds to the sense of helplessness with the case. It's a brilliantly written and darkly evocative re-creation of a time and a place that captures every feeling and nuance of an entire era. Downey Jr is perfect as the alcoholic wastrel of a crime reporter Paul Averi, as is Mark Raffalo as the dependable cop David. The film also has an ironic commentary on the complexity and inherent difficulties of old-fashioned, paper-heavy, analog detective work. Fincher's attention to detail makes Zodiac so remarkable as his most mature, rather than his most entertaining work. Zodiac is a great film that many true crime buffs would love due to the treatment given to the subject, and that many movie fans will admire thanks to David Fincher's direction and the performances of its cast.",Zodiac
260,Jay_Exiomo,Natural apprehension,8,30 May 2007,"""Zodiac"" is a whodunnit thriller but not in the sense of conventional Hollywood film-making. In fact, the film is more a study of the intricacies of the whole police procedure, as chronicled by newspaper cartoonist-turned-writer Robert Graysmith, than a straightforward cat-and-mouse game.Based from Graysmith's two non-fiction books that detail his investigation of the eponymous serial killer, director David Fincher (""Fight Club,"" ""Se7en"") pretty much sets the mood of the film early on. Henceforth, the atmosphere in the film is created and sustained mainly by dialog. After a couple of murders in the late 60s, a series of ominous letters - including ciphers - is sent to the press, claiming responsibility for the murders. The writer introduces himself as Zodiac and up to now, no arrest was ever made, nor a conclusive proof was ever acquired as to who really committed the crimes.James Vanderbilt's screenplay actually consists of two parts resulting to an overlong long movie (almost three hours) and the lack of a solid central character at times works to the film's disadvantage; but Fincher is able to deliver a constant sense of tension to the viewer especially during the first part, dealing with Zodiac's supposed killing spree and the police investigation. The performances of the actors in general are also efficient. Jake Gyllenhaal, who plays Graysmith, effectively brings out a nice transition of his character from the subdued to a passionate individual while Robert Downey, Jr. is impressive in a role that seems tailor-fit for him.However, the film somewhat lags when it shifts focus past halfway through and decides to ditch neutrality for faithfulness to the source material. That Zodiac remained inactive during those years may have something to do from a structural perspective, but ultimately that keeps the film from having a more intensity of effect.As a result, I won't go as far as saying ""Zodiac"" is Fincher's best work. But in that he delivers the requisite uneasiness and frustration amidst the dumbing down of most thrillers in general, the end effect is natural apprehension.",Zodiac

262,basrutten,You might as well watch a documentary,5,22 November 2007,"I'm a big David Fincher fan but I have to admit that he really messed up on this on. ""Zodiac"", a story about the hunt for the eponymous murderer who terrorized California for years, has high production values but falls completely flat.The movie is basically a series of loosely connected scenes that tell (part of) the story of the famous murderer and some people that try to hunt him down. There's nothing wrong with having so many plot lines in a movie but in Zodiac it's poorly done. The movie jumps around between so many characters and makes so many leaps in time that it feels very disjointed and unfocused. It's almost like watching a Discovery Channel documentary where you get to see reenactments of the most important parts from the plot.While it's true that the acting and the production values are of much higher quality than in such a documentary, that's just about everything that can be said in ""Zodiac""'s favour. The bottom line is: nothing what happens is really all that interesting. There are poorly worked out characters you don't care about, an investigation that goes nowhere, and a fairly unconvincing theory about who the Zodiac really was.While the movie does pack up a bit towards the end (once Graysmith becomes personally involved in tracking down Zodiac there is finally a bit of suspense), it's not nearly enough to make up for a seemingly endless series of scenes that ultimately go nowhere.In the end, I don't know what to do with ""Zodiac"". I can live with the fact that's it's not a standard thriller, but it doesn't do anything else very well. It's not a gripping tale with characters you care about, it's not a convincing investigation of who the Zodiac really was, and if you really want to know about the Zodiac you're much better off on Wikipedia or the Discovery Channel.**1/2 out of ***** (the acting is good and it looks very convincing; that should count for something)",Zodiac

It's long, but it does not feel that way because of its fluid storytelling and a long list of cast members. Everyone is great in it and Gyllenhall is great in his best role to date.

The ensemble cast is first-rate: Jake Gyllenhaal as San Francisco Chronicle cartoonist Robert Graysmith, who becomes obsessed with discovering Zodiac's identity as the killer mails one taunting letter after another to the newspaper's offices, Robert Downey Jr. as Paul Avery, the Chronicle columnist who is likewise drawn into the web and suffers mightily for it, Mark Ruffalo and Anthony Edwards as Dave Toschi and Bill Armstrong, the veteran cops on Zodiac's trail, Chloe Sevigny as Graysmith's long-suffering wife, and John Carroll Lynch as Arthur Leigh Allen, the eccentric, physically imposing man whom both Toschi and Graysmith come to believe is the murderer. 157 minutes go by in a breathless rush as events unfold on the screen; more than a decade passes and Zodiac remains maddeningly out of reach, but the viewer is intrigued and absorbed by the journey these real-life characters take. Having praised ""Zodiac"" as art, I don't mind pointing out what a mess it is factually. The most glaring of Fincher's deliberate errors is the relationship between Robert Graysmith and Paul Avery (a major feature of the film). The two men didn't know each other while working at the Chronicle; according to Avery they met only twice, years after they'd both left the newspaper. And while Arthur Leigh Allen (who died in 1992) looked like a great suspect for a while, authorities have never been able to connect him to the Zodiac murders. Not only did Allen's handwriting fail to match the killer's but, in 2002, DNA recovered from a stamp on one of Zodiac's letters did not match Allen's DNA profile. This point is conceded at the end of the film...but in painfully small type that does nothing to alter the impression repeatedly reinforced by Fincher: that Allen *was* Zodiac, and that all the circumstantial evidence makes this conclusion inescapable. It doesn't. No, ""Zodiac"" does not exactly tell the true story of those horrific murders at the close of the '60s and the long investigation that followed (how could it, being based as it is on Graysmith's stunningly inaccurate 1986 book?), but it's a sprawling epic that does precisely what a movie is supposed to do. It entertains, it fascinates, it makes you want to tell other people that they should see it, too. But because the source of this fascination is a series of real-life murders, advise your friends to seek out the facts of the case after seeing Fincher's film.",Zodiac

""Zodiac"" is as much about the murders as it is about the aftermath of the events and the toll it took on a handful of people who perhaps sacrificed more than their job called for in an effort to reveal the killer's identity.David Fincher brings the true life horror story to life with what is perhaps his most methodical and restrained effort to date. With as much attention to detail as possible (down to matching the wardrobes of the cast to that of the real-life victims) Fincher reels back his usual sense of style in favor for a more matter-of-fact, realistic tone, letting the story and the actors speak for themselves. There are moments such as the taxi-cab scene where his style is in full-effect, but unlike his previous film, ""Panic Room,"" the film doesn't hinge solely on good looks. At times, such as the murder by the lake, it's easy to forget that you're watching a movie.The film is host to a wealth of knock-out performances, the least of all being Robert Downey Jr. in a comeback role that surely should have earned him at least an Oscar nod. Surely, his turn in this movie was more effective than that in ""Tropic Thunder,"" but I digress. Downey is almost too natural and too perfect as the flamboyant and sensational journalist Paul Avery. Jake Gyllenhaal is given perhaps one of his juiciest roles to date as the cartoonist turned novelist Robert Graysmith who puts everything -- including his wife and kids -- on hold for the sake of his obsession. Also of note are Mark Ruffalo and Anthony Edwards as a pair of detectives hot on the Zodiac's trail.All in all, ""Zodiac"" is an in-depth account of real-life events and is certainly a lot to take in. The passage of time thankfully goes by fast, as you'll more than likely find yourself wrapped up in the story much like the people you're watching become. For Fincher, it marks a new standard and shows the director as more than just an MTV-bred cult film-maker. This is without a doubt one of the finest films from 2007 and one of the best of its kind. Not to be missed.",Zodiac
269,TheMovieMark,The fear of the real and the unknown...,9,2 March 2007,"Dark. Moody. Atmospheric. All words to describe a candlelight dinner with Johnny Betts. But these words can also be used to accurately describe David Fincher's latest foray into the serial killer genre.Zodiac has been on my ""most anticipated"" list for quite some time, but having watched many documentaries and read several articles on the subject, I couldn't help but wonder how the film could completely keep my interest when I already knew so much about the material. Plus, we're all aware that the case officially remains unresolved, so are we to resign ourselves to accept an unsatisfactory conclusion? It took no more than the film's chilling opening scene to cast my fears aside and glue me to the seat for 158 minutes. My familiarity with the source material actually heightened my enjoyment because I was surprised at how accurately the film depicted the events. I recognized names and details that I wouldn't have otherwise.I also feel that not definitively knowing the Zodiac's identity adds more suspense to the story. We're introduced to a number of suspects, and since this is, in part, one man's interpretation of circumstantial evidence, we're allowed to assume that any of the suspects could be the mysterious killer. It's a plot device that effectively keeps the viewer in a constant state of unease.I know there are multiple theories on the Zodiac's identity, so you can argue that the film ends on an anticlimactic note. But the movie does have focus, and it presents a compelling case against one of the suspects in such a way that it delivers as much closure as you can expect.The actors are great (especially Downey and his welcome comic relief), the atmosphere is foreboding, and the investigative process is engaging. It may run a little long for some, but I didn't mind the runtime at all. It's a fascinating case, and I wanted all the information the movie was willing to give me.Zodiac is the kind of film that sticks with you. I was at a friend's house late after the screening, and when I arrived home I saw a lone car's headlights appear from up the street. My heart began to race a little as I hastened to my door. I knew then and there that a new Zodiac killer was in the vicinity, and I had no time to tarry.It's been a while since a movie instilled that sort of realistic dread, and I don't know if that's a good thing, but it's certainly a sign (no pun intended) of the film's success in heightening our awareness of what kind of real-life monsters might be lurking in the shadows.THE GIST Zodiac gives viewers an excellent combination of nerve-racking suspense and desperately obsessed police procedural work. The majority of viewers with even the slightest interest in the case should be riveted. Those of you with a severely small attention span should probably stick to Norbit instead.",Zodiac
270,anthonyjlangford,Realism over Plot,8,19 April 2009,"David Fincher returns after the below par Panic Room to bring us the true story of the Zodiac killings; a series of murders in the San Francisco area in the late sixties. The story centers on Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal) a cartoonist for the Chronicle, who lays witness to the story unraveling around him as the murderer, who calls himself Zodiac, demands that his cryptic letters are published. Robert Downey Jnr is perfectly cast as the alcoholic reporter who gets in over his head, but it is Mark Ruffalo as the detective heading up the case who turns in the most solid performance. The film is laden with star studded parts, including but not limited to, Anthony Edwards, Chloė Sevigny and Elias Koteas. The film is based on Graysmith's own bestselling novels, Zodiac and Zodiac Unmasked which makes it unlike many Hollywood films based on true events; it's filled with factual incidents. This makes for a fascinating journey. The only factor which lets it down is its length. Fincher tries hard to inject it with fresh visuals, which he is renowned for and at times, the CGI enhanced shots of period San Francisco are impressive. But even he realizes the story is in his characters and their dialog which is why a mini series may have been a better format. Interestingly, Fincher fought at preserving the 158 page screenplay, though for once, the studios may have been right. At over two and half hours, its matter of fact pacing makes it never ending. However, having viewed it again on DVD, the duration is less of a problem.Zodiac highlights just how difficult a crime investigators task can be, when it comes to accumulating all the right pieces within the context of the law. Sometimes it doesn't go as we expect, or more importantly, hope. Movies and television have blinded us to the realities of real life crime. They must have a plot, development and a pay-off when we know in reality, life doesn't work that way. It's invigorating to see the realism that has crept into mainstream cinema over the past few years. While every story may have been told, we can look forward to telling them in different ways, where such remarks as 'That only happens in the movies,' may become a catch cry of the past.",Zodiac
271,heisenberg12,"Decent crime flick, but way too long and more of a ""run of the mill"" type",5,6 June 2017,"Fincher is among my favorite directors of today, and his craft is definitely one of the most redeemable qualities of Zodiac, but the movie is overly long and struggles to rise out of the ""run of the mill"" type labels for crime drama mystery films. While certainly decent and worth a view if you haven't gotten around to it, it never really separates itself from what you'd expect from the genre. One crucial element that I think makes it pale in comparison to Seven is the simple fact that it's based on a true story, whereas the fictional element of Seven made it original and different. I also wasn't impressed by any of the cast's performance, but Ruffalo stood out and was slightly above average. It was decent, but I wouldn't watch it again or highly recommend it, especially compared to Fincher""s more unique movies such as Seven, The Game, and Gone Girl. 5/10",Zodiac
272,jemps918,Only after enduring almost 3 hrs was I able to understand the necessary length,8,11 June 2007,"Only after enduring the 2 hrs and 40 odd minutes director David Fincher took to unravel Zodiac was I able to understand the necessary length. It shared with the audience the feelings of frustration, anticipation, helplessness, fear and need for closure, which does not always happen.Jake Gyllenhaal turns in another sparkling performance as Robert Graysmith, newspaper cartoonist and later obsessive author of the book on which the movie is based. Mark Ruffalo uglies up his mug to convincingly play David Toschi, one of the inspectors assigned to the case. Robert Downey Jr. is in his element as the charming rogue journalist Paul Avery, who covers the Zodiac killer's beat on the paper. John Carroll Lynch very eerily plays suspected Zodiac killer Arthur Leigh Allen.Things don't always make sense but that is the ugly, unedited truth of murder of this serial variety, especially seeing it in context, in this age of hi-tech CSI-type shows. This movie shows not only how the deaths affect the victims' families but also how dangerous obsessions on such cases, while not exactly original (Black Dahlia, etc.) can consume even bystanders and those not directly involved.",Zodiac
273,pinkliz41,David Fincher continues his trend of classic films.,10,9 October 2008,"A masterpiece? Deffinatley it is. David Fincher, director of classics like Fight Club and Se7en brings audiences one of the best films of all time and certainly one of the best of the decade. Zodiac brings together powerful performances with a complex but harrowing story and perfect directing. If ever having to decide what one of the best acted films were of all time, Zodiac would definitely be up there.The story is intriguing and gripping as is the searing acting capabilities of Downey Jr and Ghylenahall. Both unforgettable and classic.The narrative is dark but powerful and at most times creepy and thrilling. The most plausible though are the directing and acting. Fincher who has outdone himself weaves a timeless trail of gripping shots and angles that make you sit back and enjoy. OK despite being 2 hours 45 minutes running time and which is taken up by mostly talking, please just sit down and be patient with the films approach. Which leaks a hell of a lot of character as well as plot substance. But believe me the imagination of this master at work is both brilliant and compelling and you wont regret seeing this film.",Zodiac
274,freaky_dave,A good fact-based mystery,8,5 March 2007,"Based on Robert Graysmith's novel, this was a really good mystery involving detectives from different districts, a reporter, and a cartoonist. In fact is wasn't really about the killer at all, but more about the obsession of the four main characters as they took years to try an solve the mystery of the infamous Zodiac killer, only to never find enough evidence to ever capture him.In the late 1960s, a killer calling himself only the Zodiac went on a rampage killing from between six to a possible 100 people through the years. Four men, a cartoonist (Jake Gyllenhaal) a reporter (Robert Downey Junior) and two FBI agents (Mark Ruffalo and Anthony Edwards) took years to discover who the killer was, but he never was caught. There were suspects, but there was never enough evidence to prove anything.Jake Gyllenhaal played Robert Graysmith. At the beginning of the movie he is more like a secondary character as the story focuses mainly on the two detectives and the reporter as they try to solve the case in their own ways. After years of trying and never able to capture the Zodiac killer, they all let the case fade out. It is during the last half of the movie that Gyllenhaal's character suddenly takes center stage and the other three become secondary. It was a clever trick and one that worked beautifully.This movie is more about obsession than anything else. It shows how obsession can ruin lives and lead to eminent disaster for those involved. It also shows what some people will do to try and prove something that might not be worth the time anymore.Zodiac is not the perfect mystery though. It never did explain those calls that Gyllenhaal's character was getting when he was still working on the case in those later years. Were they calls from the Zodiac killer or not? Also I couldn't accept the somewhat upbeat ending which explained what the characters were doing presently after the movie ended. Otherwise, it was a good movie.",Zodiac
275,santiagocosme,What the hell happened?,7,25 May 2016,"Being a big fan of TV series such as Crime Mysteries, I was already aware of quite a few things about the story of Zodiac. In fact, if I am not wrong there have been several different ones over the course of the last 30 years. In this case, the police is trying to capture a suspect who is killing random people and then calling the Newspapers to admit his guilt. Even though, the police seems to get closer and closer to the person who did it, they never have enough ammunition to make anyone face justice. As time passes by, the police gets desperate, the newspapers lose interest, and only a guy who draws for a column continues to find the murderer. Did he ever get to him? Only by watching the movie will you find out. It is slow at times, and you don't really understand why they feel the need to tell that this scene or the other happened ""one day later"" or ""two days later"", but apart from this little details, Zodiac is a good movie to watch by my standards.",Zodiac

The ace director David Fincher tells the story with the help of supremely talented actors playing the lead characters and the done to death details of the investigation. At many points, you would like to pause, rewind and play back so that you do not miss the clues to catch the Zodiac. Just like the lead characters, you are bound to get obsessed to catch the Zodiac.

It wouldn't have been out of place if it had been released in the 1970's and helmed by somebody like Alan Pakula or Robert Altman. This should not put you off. Old fashioned craftsmanship is good and David Fincher has done a fine job. I think that ""Zodiac"" is a much better movie than ""Panic Room"".

And the stellar characterizations (Gyllenhall, Ruffalo & Downey JR sparkle!), who do take up space, but their private lives are expertly spun around the case focus as to not distract from it.

280,David_Frames,An open letter to IMDb readers from Zodiac,7,29 May 2007,"There I was, the most incisive, quotable, culturally literate review I'd ever written  just sitting there on my desktop, awaiting internet publication  a review so good it was almost a religious experience and what happens? I get a letter from my old friend the Zodiac killer whom having seen the David Fincher film based on his case, felt compelled (as he inevitably does) to write what he thought of it and would I mind posting the text of his letter instead? Normally I'd have told him to go and shoot some teenagers but he let me advertise for a room mate on his myspace once so An open letter to IMDb readers from Zodiac Hello David, this is the Zodiac.Did you see it? I suppose you must have by now. You better have made an attempt for your sake and not, as you threatened to do, go and see that Pirates of the Caribbean crap. Looks like I won our little wager but it's like I told you  if you want a movie made about you you'll either have do something important or do what I did and murder some young people (and one idiot cab driver, though to be fair they're sort of okay as they're always overcharging people anyway  I mean, $6 for a $3 fare? You know he deserved it).So last night, after what seemed like an eternity, I finally got time off to go to the Castro Theater and see Zodiac, the long overdue film about me. I mean what took them so long for Christ's sake? I don't want to hear about Dirty Harry, I mean, sure, good movie and I loved the girl in a hole stuff  wish I'd thought of it, but Andy Robinson was such a flake. Getting caught so easily and laughing like a pervert. That's supposed to be me? If murder wasn't a capital crime I'd have sued their asses clean off.So anyway, the Fincher movie isn't too bad. #$%****()  there you go, pick the bones out of that. Did I confound your analogue mind? I've got a books worth of these. So yeah, It was pretty good, took me right back to the glory days  lots of great period detail and that pig Toschi was just like I imagined him  absolutely clueless. Well I say clueless, he did interview me but you don't get arrested for sweating like a rapist and licking your lips every time a murder is mentioned. Incidentally that was a shock to me too.&&**((%^#. Any ideas? You don't have a clue do you? Its important to have a USP if you're planning on being a serial murderer, people forget that and that's why in the league of psychotic media folk legends I'm still in top five, though Jack the Ripper is always going to be no.1 and overrated for the same reason as the Beatles will always supersede the Stones  history never forgives you if you go on too long.Gore Verbinski take note.Even though I wasn't in Zodiac as much as I would of liked I still enjoyed the stuff about bird brain Avery and that geek Graysmith, to whom I'd have paid a visit if he didn't live on the other side of town and it wasn't two buses. It's certainly ironic that I killed several people and slept pretty well at night, sometimes better because of what I did and these guys fell apart and got all obsessive. And they didn't even shoot anyone! Merely slaves in my world. Watching Avery, as played by Downley Jnr, stuffing popcorn into my mouth was all I could not to laugh. I suppose you noticed (and would have droned on about) the recurring time motif in the movie? I named myself after a watch, time is always referenced, the search for me goes on across decades, etc Loved that 'time lapse' scene with the Transamerica pyramid  isn't it incredible what they can do these days? Yeah, my work certainly did burn up those pigs lives.Also, did you notice how Fincher took a celluloid swing at me by flouting thriller conventions? I'll bet you did you geeky freak. I love the movies, this is well known and the one I dreamt about, involving myself, had more gore and just focused on how good I was, particularly toward the end when the pigs gave up and I laughed at their embarrassment. You saw Seven, right? That was my movie in all but name. So having waited all these years I finally get the film of my life and it isn't about me at all, plus it doesn't even stick to the formula of these things. Why wasn't Graysmith psychologically connected to me in some way and where was the climax? John Doe got a head in a box and I get a photo I.D in an airport? Man, I couldn't have killed enough people.&*#$$%!^. See what I did there? Of course you didn't you servile camel jacker.By the way, are we still on for Wedding Daze?",Zodiac

282,datorsiers2,Believable,8,30 August 2015,"Although very slow paced and lenghty, it is an interesting, thought-provoking movie, that seems realistic. Not your typical serial killer thriller, at first we get presented with some homicides, but for the wast majority of the screen time it is just about police going through trial and error to find the Zodiac killer, after they relegate from the task, a cartoonist, who has become obsessed with the case tries to solve the case himself. At least i think, that Robert Graysmith got it right and he found the zodiac killer, all he said was - ''i just need to look him in the eyes and know that is him'', which he approved by meeting Leigh face to face.Sure, this may not be the most interesting and action packed movie you will see, characters come and go, since it is supposed to happen over the course of more than a decade. It's about showing how police can not do anything without genuine evidence leading to them dropping the case off. Also a great point was, when somebody mentioned it was great business for the newspaper, and that is very true, newspaper only cared for a brief moment about the Zodiac killer and they were more than happy for the extra publicity received.Believable, real, nothing too crazy, lenghty, if you are into movies about homicide investigations, you should check this out, since it brings something new to the table and i worth watching after all.

283,jdring2007,"a comprehensive, intelligent, and suspenseful account of the source material",8,14 June 2021,"Rather than glorifying the titular serial killer, as most movies ""like this"" do, the film focuses on the investigation side of the killings, and even after them (spanning over a decade), when the case shifts from the fervent detective work of police to the obsession of a newspaper cartoonist. All based on actual events, and the cartoonist's book on the matter, makes the movie even more compelling. The superb performances by Jake Gyllenhaal and Mark Ruffalo, and a repeatedly ensemble or at least recognizable cast, are what helps make the ridiculous length seem not that bad. In a movie about an actual serial killer who was never caught, you almost don't want there to be a lot of grisly action scenes; and there aren't. Two or three suffice to keep your blood pumping and your heart invested, which the rest of the movie does well enough on its own.",Zodiac

286,moutonbear25,David's Game,8,4 March 2007,"Who doesn't like to play games? You face the other players dead on and you struggle to retain control over the board, keeping everyone else guessing as to what your next move will be. In the 1960's and 70's, one such game player, who called himself the Zodiac, decided all by himself that he would start his own game. He would decide who the players would be and he would make up all the rules. The stakes in his game though were a slight bit higher than your average game of Risk. Drawing his inspiration from a 1932 film entitled ""The Most Dangerous Game"", where a man hunts other humans because he feels them to be the most dangerous animal of all, the Zodiac began a series of senseless killings that terrorized the people of San Francisco. And this was just the start for this game. The Zodiac sent letters to several prominent San Francisco media outlets, demanding that they print his confessions and their accompanying ciphers on their front page. Fearing that the Zodiac would make good on the threats his letters contained if they didn't, the messages ran and the public went into a state of mass paranoia and fear. As the killings and messages went on for years, the Zodiac baffled the police and the public with a mystery that remains inconclusively unsolved.Another man who clearly enjoys his game play is director David Fincher. In SE7EN, he toyed with our morals; in FIGHT CLUB, he split personalities and teased our collective subconscious; and in PANIC ROOM, he locked us in a tiny space and made us feel like we couldn't breathe. He even made a movie entitled THE GAME at one point. For his first film in five years, Fincher plays with our basic need to understand and to make sense of something. ZODIAC bounces back and forth between an exhausting police investigation that spreads across numerous jurisdictions, the frightening killings themselves and the life of a cartoonist who develops a fascination with the Zodiac that eventually becomes a crippling obsession. Jake Gyllenhaal plays Robert Graysmith, the real life man who went from drawing satirical cartoons for the San Francisco Chronicle to writing the definitive book on the Zodiac killings. Graysmith is a natural when it comes to solving puzzles so when he is exposed through his position at the SF Chronicle to private information regarding the killings, he needs to piece this one together too. It is the mother of all puzzles and there is no way he can let it go unsolved.Subsequently, we too need to figure this whole mess out. Fincher makes it so Graysmith's obsession becomes ours as well by allowing us to have only certain pieces of the puzzle at certain times. The sheer vastness of how far the Zodiac's murders were spread out meant that many clues went undeveloped because they needed others to be brought to light. Fittingly, ZODIAC is one of the darkest films I've seen. Yes, I meant that to suggest that it is twisted and sick like any serial killer film should be but I was referring more to Harris Savides's stark use of lighting throughout. Light tends more to showcase than fill which keeps the viewer just as in the dark as the police and the San Francisco public. Even the humour is dark. James Vanderbilt's script is dizzying as it travels back and forth between the vast number of lives affected by the Zodiac but he still manages to find laughs amidst a mass murder investigation. The laughs may feel awkward but ZODIAC is meant to be uncomfortable and, like any harrowing and consuming experience, it would be impossible to make it through it if we didn't laugh every once in a while.Captions constantly remind the viewer that time is passing by at a rapid rate yet at no point does the film feel long. While the passage of time reflects the reality of the events that took place, it also ensures the viewer knows how frustrating the entire investigation was. All involved went years without coming to any substantiated conclusions. With the central focus of their lives not making any sense, it became impossible to connect with the rest of their surroundings. ZODIAC is an intensely involving mystery that is both chilling and infuriating in all the right ways. It is itself its own puzzle remaining to be solved. Without understanding, there is no security or certainty. Just like a game of checkers or going out on a first date, success depends on figuring out the other player as much as it involves understanding yourself. The same applies to the investigation of the Zodiac killings. You will need to know how and why it happened but you will not really want to, considering to fully understand this mystery means staring into the eyes of a murderer who kills for sport. Good game, Mr. Fincher.",Zodiac

288,hemant_balz,The unsolved serial mystery,7,3 June 2010,Zodiac by David Fincher deserves a true applause.Based on a true incident a notorious killer takes to the streets of California nearly killing what approximates to 37 of as per stated by Zodiac killer letters.This movie is much like Seven in many ways but this absolutely is a true event.The cryptograms sent to the police by Zodiac are very puzzling.I even read that till now those cryptograms have not been deciphered.The star-cast in the movie is brilliant & the voice of Zodiac can be heard with his letters.Thats just so amazing.The prime suspected for the killings never looked like the one who could have been the Zodiac.This is thrilling stuff from David Fincher as people really fear the Zodiac.His threat calls really spread panic on the people faces & their souls.People become tensed for their children as many threats were made for the kidnapping of school kids.Police confirmed only 6 cases but i believe that he may have killed a lot more than that.The movie ends up with the Zodiac killer not been caught & the last letter by Zodiac himself speaks for everything.He mentions that they will make a movie starring him as a villain.And he would like to know who's gonna play his part.His wish came true.The executioner suit of Zodiac was really pretty scary.People & the press started to portray him as a legend who became a myth.This is a pretty cool unsolved mystery focusing basically on the prowess & the havoc created by the Zodiac.Still we are unsure whether he still lives or not.But some people in California are still not willing to walk out freely on the streets just due to the terror & the history behind that of the Zodiac killer.,Zodiac
289,tapio_hietamaki,My personal favorite David Fincher movie,10,23 March 2017,"Described as 'boring' and 'without a satisfying ending' by a friend of mine, 'Zodiac' is a brooding and bleak look into detective procedure. It's a bit like 'The Killing' in that way.'Zodiac' is a faithful retelling of an actual murder case, based on a book written on the case by a reporter who devoted much of his life to studying it. The movie presents the mass of clues, the plentiful evidence and the various people working on the case in a clear and easy-to-follow manner, a daunting task which deserves credit. The case invites you to dive deeper and deeper into the evidence and make up your theories, and it can get you really obsessed, which is what happens to the characters in the movie.Like the tagline says, 'there's more than one way to lose your life to a killer'. The characters are rarely in any actual danger - it's not an action movie. There's not any gunfights or car chases here. The danger is in getting your priorities in the wrong order, in trying to solve the unsolvable, following leads that take you nowhere, devoting you time to things that take you away from real life.David Fincher is one of the best directors working today. In 2007 he hadn't yet partnered up with Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross on the score department but 'Zodiac' still has that familiar Fincher thriller mood. Fincher soaks every scene in comfortable earth tones, making the movie very pleasant on the eyes, and sometimes there's good 60's pop music to listen to.Definitely my personal favorite David Fincher movie (though I haven't seen 'The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo' yet).",Zodiac
290,Ar_Pharazon_the_golden,Immaculate. Uninteresting.,5,23 July 2012,"First of all, let's admit that there is nothing wrong with the film. The acting is good, the direction is fine, and you can't really criticise the script - it's a real story and there's not so much they could do to make it more captivating. The only thing I can think of, is that it lasts way too long. And I mean way too long. There is a reason there have been several films with serial killers loosely based on the zodiac killer but this was the first (major anyway) one to deal with the actual case. It's not very good movie material. You have a murderer who commits a few crimes in a 2-3 year span, and then you're left with most of the film, where there is no participation of the killer, no new clues, just the (real story or not, it's the same) cliché of the guy who becomes so involved with the case that he loses touch with his family and blah blah. Fincher focuses on the zodiac investigators not out of choice, but because there is nothing else to do. You can make a fine story without ever revealing the killer, but when you don't reveal (since you don't know) anything about him, I think the reasonable reaction is quite similar to the one of the public towards the actual case: after a while, no one cares. You can appreciate certain parts of the film, there are a few memorable scenes, but it's not one I'd bother watching again.",Zodiac

It may be slow, but the story telling and story line is very well done and interesting, it kept me guessing and was pretty suspenseful.

I'm really looking forward to Gone Girl - I hope it's one of his 'A' game movies and not one of his 'B' game ones.Zodiac has a great cast:Robert Downey Jnr plays the same character he always plays - but we love him for it, he's a star not an actor. Mark Ruffalo is his classic Angryman, but it suits his cop role perfectly. But Jake G - the man delivers yet again, playing the autistic cartoonist lead perfectly.As I say in the subject, it just goes to show: take a good book or any good story, and then just try to tell it as well as you can (good direction upon a good cast), and lo and behold you end up with a good movie.And truth always trumps fiction!------",Zodiac

294,grnhair2001,"Fantastic cast, but...",5,17 October 2020,"Talk about some heavy-hitter actors! And they do well with what they are given. But the constant slamming us with pop music from the era grated on me quickly, by minute 12 (I always wanted to die to an ""appropriate"" Donovan song...not). That nearly made me turn it off, but I suffered through, never ending the wish that they'd hired a composer to write original music instead of doing what they did.I've seen lengthy documentaries on this case which are far more interesting and fact-filled than this was. The case is an odd one. The fact they put in tiny print at the end ""but DNA evidence revealed it couldn't have been who Graysmith thinks it was"" negates the meaning of the plot and the power of the movie. It's interesting how other lives can be ruined by such a case--newspaper reporters and detectives didn't fare well and probably died, in some cases, younger than they should've because of their connection with Zodiac. And the movie does a good job of showing that.Best scene was when they confronted the suspect, and they passed around the watch. Everyone in that scene nailed the subtleties of acting it. For a moment, I thought they were cops, not actors.. Robert Downey Jr gets to pretty much play himself.Louis Joseph Myers is probably a better candidate for Zodiac, but of course they bought the rights to this book, and so the movie had no reason to talk about that, not reality.",Zodiac

It started out OK, but after a while, it didn't really reach a substantial point and just went on and on and on (and on). I mean, honestly, did they actually need 3 hours to tell the story of a serial killer the police didn't even catch? Come on! Another low point was that once the plot shifted toward Jake Gyllenhall's character it turned out to be another film completely. This could've been nice somehow, but the trailer, you see, sold me a cinematic thriller, not the story of a geeky journalist on a vendetta of some sort. And what's that about his wife leaving him and saying their marriage was ""a date that lasted too long"" after they were married for more than a few years and even had children?!?

296,Barky44,"Wow, what a GREAT movie!",9,30 November 2010,"Phew, wow. Just finished watching Zodiac, and I have to say that it FAR exceeded my expectations!Frankly, I wasn't sure what to expect. ""Zodiac"" popped up on my Netflix ""recommended"" list for unknown reasons. I had heard good buzz about the film, although I don't remember it being out. So I said ""meh"" and rented it.This film has reminded me of what good, suspense drama is all about. It has literally renewed my faith in the genre.I don't want to over-analyze the film, because I think that might ruin it, but here's a quick list of what I found appealing about the film:-- Its pacing and tension is reminiscent of some of the dramatic elements of great 60's/70's crime dramas like Serpico and Bullitt.-- Yet it tells the story without any great car chases or shoot outs. This is a VERY good thing, for you find yourself absorbed into the story without being shocked out of it by noise.-- It is even filmed using 70's era lighting techniques. It looks like you're watching a classic, but it was filmed in 2007! This SO suits this film.-- The characters are gritty and real. No pretty boys or hot vixens. This helps absorb you into the story.-- The acting is top notch. These folks do what good acting is supposed to do: makes you forget these are actors, even though some of them have big names (one exception: Brian Cox does come on a bit strong as attorney Melvin Belli, but actually, he ROCKS this performance, because it's supposed to be over-the-top). The cast is quite stellar in this.-- It keeps you guessing all the way through, but it also doesn't lose you in vagaries. The writers aren't TRYING to lose you, they're just telling a complex story and asking you to keep up. Kudos to them.-- It does not overburden you with heavy detail like some murder mysteries. Instead it portrays the illusion that the CHARACTERS are overburdened with detail. This is a huge plot point and very well played. There are no deus ex machinas here, you can tell the characters earned every bit of their successes (and failures). -- There is enough creep, gore, and suspense to keep you adequately ""wierded out"".I tell ya: I really liked this flick. Makes me have hope for movies again.",Zodiac
297,film_riot,Zodiac,8,19 August 2007,"David Fincher is back in the serial killer genre. With ""Se7en"" he delivered one of the masterpieces of thrillers. So the expectations for another serial killer film of him are almost unattainable. But Fincher is a smart boy and knows that and so he went into a completely different direction, which was about the cleverest thing he could do. In ""Zodiac"" he plays with the expectations of the audience. He starts the film with multiple killings, but he didn't shoot these scenes the way you would see them in a thriller, he uses a very unexcited and more observing style. Often the film is called a thriller, but I don't really see where this is coming from. There are definitely frightening scenes (like the one in the house, where you hear footsteps above), but it is more a character drama, or as Fincher sometimes calls it in interviews, a press film. With ""Zodiac"", Fincher proves that he is really a director who can do anything (well, we haven't seen a Fincher-comedy). Before I forget it, great actors: Jake Gyllenhaal, Robert Downey Jr., Mark Ruffalo,",Zodiac
298,cdjh-81125,An Ambitious Serial Killer Movie Like No Other,8,21 October 2016,"David Fincher has truly proved to be a master and physiological thrillers and serial killer stories but before I watched this movie I was sceptical if it could work, because it spans so many years and different stories so it would be hard to bring this all together for a cohesive narrative. Another thing I was worried about was if this movie as a whole would be satisfying as the real Zodiac killer was never caught so I was wondering if it would really be a story worth telling. But it truly was this movie is fantastic and is truly one of Fincher best efforts. This movie does jump in time a lot but it's done in away so that you see the long lasting effects on the characters without ever feeling bored. Jake Gyllenhall is incredible in this movie he perfectly conveys his characters child like innocence and the toll that his obsessive investigation into the Zodiac has on him and in my opinion was snubbed an Oscar for this movie. Robert Downey Jr also really blew me away in this movie he's really able to come across as an arrogant character at first and then turns into a sympathetic and damaged one once you realise just how much the Zodiac has cost him. The investigation is always compelling your always engaged by it and are desperate to see the case solved so that the characters can feel some piece of mind. The final scene between Graysmith and Allan is truly incredible had this scene not been included I don't know if this movie would have been as satisfying it just makes you feel some piece for Graysmith and further proves how incredible Gyllenhall is. My biggest and really only problem with this movie is the fact that the last act wasn't nearly as interesting you start to feel the run time and needed to include the other supporting characters more. Zodiac is a great film despite its disappointing last act it's got amazing performances a compelling mystery and a surprisingly satisfying pay off. 87%-A-",Zodiac

301,teh_mode,"Stylish, compelling, gripping work",8,12 July 2007,"David Fincher attempted to comprehend the mindset of the serial killer in his 1995 hit serial killer movie Seven. Zodiac  his latest film  focuses much more intently on those obsessively attempting to hunt the killer down. Based on the true story of the ""Zodiac killer"" of the late 1960s, Zodiac stars Jake Gyllenhaal as cartoonist Robert Graysmith, who really worked for the San Francisco Chronical in the late 1960s, and throughout the 70s. After a teenage couple are brutally attacked and shot by an unknown assailant in the quiet outskirts of Vallejo, California, a coded letter is sent to both the San Francisco Chornical and the police. Unable to decrypt the enigmatic letter, top crime beat reporter, Paul Avery (Robert Downey Jr.), is helped by political cartoonist Graysmith who, despite not being directly involved in the Zodiac story, has a varied knowledge of puzzle solving, and manages to recognise the letter from old zodiac signs. Meanwhile, the Zodiac killer begins a year long murder spree, in which at least five people died at his hands, all the while taunting police and the media through his ciphered letters. The investigation is led by Dave Toschi (Mark Ruffalo), who engulfs himself knee-deep into the case, before realising he is following a cold trail. It is at this juncture, that Graysmith decides to follow his own in-depth investigation, much to the anguish of his wife and family.Although the movie starts by showing us the grizzly series of murders, Zodiac very quickly settles down to explore the lives of those who become obsessed with capturing the enigmatic serial killer. At times the movie focuses on the reporting side of the story, and then quickly shifts to the case itself, involving the detectives hunting him down personally. When the case becomes stagnant, and Avery loses his grip on the job, only Graysmith continues to fight for any semblance of a revelation. Day and night, he entraps himself in a world of clues and codes, turning his back on his family, his job and even his own sense of reality.David Fincher's film does an excellent job of asking the question of at what point does intrigue become obsession. Although it doesn't appear to be as flashy and stylised as Fincher's previous work, his clever use of CGI and editing techniques are every bit as nuanced as the likes of Seven and Fight Club. There is one terrific scene where we follow a cab through the streets of San Francisco, pre-murder - from the birdseye view. Fincher's use of music also contributes to both the atmosphere of the piece, and the cultural era we venture back to. Fincher moves tautfully from the late sixties, right through to the seventies, with verve and cultural awareness for the times we re-visit. But for all of Fincher's neo-auteuristic flourishes, the other major factor that sets Zodiac above any other crime film this year is its fantastic cast. Jake Gyllenhaal may be the future of Hollywood, but he has already conquered the here and now for intellectual, unorthodox leading men. Mark Ruffalo once again shows everyone just why he is so underrated as an actor. And a whole host of supporting players, including Brian Cox, Elias Coteas and Anthony Edwards ensure there are few gaps left to fill. The only damp spot would be Robert Downey Jr., whose showy performance as Paul Avery is far too often given the Downey Jr caricature treatment that effects so much of his work. But for the most part this is grade A stuff all round. At two and a half hours it is a long ride, but at no point did I feel the running time. Seven was his breakout, Zodiac is David Fincher's monolith.",Zodiac

303,Camoo,Fincher's maturation but ruined by Viper Camera,10,15 April 2007,"Years on I am editing this. I was turned off initially by my Zodiac theatrical experience. But I have come back to this film time and time again on DVD and find it to be really masterful, and one of the best things David Fincher has done. But I'll leave my old review below, for posterity. I will have to split this into two parts because I was conflicted. Honestly, I did love what Fincher was trying to do- make a narrative film that wasn't propelled by gore or special camera tricks, but by story. I loved the acting, particularly Robert Downey Jr, the subtle script developments, the mystery surrounding this case. I was first in line to see it. But I was also the first, I think, to walk out. I couldn't stand Fincher's use of the Thomson Viper cam, and the films I've seen with that camera in general, which include Michael Mann's last two films. I understand the advantages of shooting like this, much more flexibility in low light situations, the ability to basically have a hard drive replace the film reel, keep everything categorized digitally for direct digital transfer for editing, maintaining low costs and so on. But this is David Fincher. And Michael Mann. What on earth are these guys doing cutting costs by sacrificing image quality??? I could understand why someone like Woody Allen might want to make a talkie on the fly like this, but these guys have built careers out of moods defined by their cinematography. The film might have looked good in post, but was decidedly grainy on the big screen. I was sitting in the front row on opening night and I was literally squinting my eyes, simultaneously trying to make out details that would have been directly visible on film, and sheltering them from the oncoming headache created by watching miniature pixels float around in front of me.",Zodiac

305,samseescinema,A Fascinating Portrait of a Mystery by the Master of Loom,9,1 March 2007,"Zodiac reviewed by Samuel Osborn Consider the complications involved in making Zodiac. Fact: the Zodiac killer was never caught. Fact: Robert Graysmith, the main character, survived to write the books the film is based upon and is still alive today. These two very relevant, very essential facts are widely known. So how does a filmmaker go about making a thriller where any suspense surrounding the hero is moot, and where the audience already knows the ending? These aren't spoilers, they're circumstances. They force Zodiac into uncultivated territory, and it makes for the most beguiling mystery sincewell, since the last time David Fincher made a film about serial killers (Se7en).What first must be realized, I suppose, is that Zodiac is probably not what audiences expect. The film was meant for an Oscar slating. Planned for November 2006 release, complications in post-production and the final cut pushed it out to its present low-key March release (exact details are sketchy). Typical March fare is stuff like Ghost Rider and 300 (which, by the way, is a glorious piece of work); pulpy films without the earning power for a more lucrative summer release. What this all means for Zodiac is that audiences walk in expecting a lot of blood, a lot of violence, and a lot of hair-tearing insanity from the type of serial killer that gets a March release. Zodiac isn't that film. This isn't even what David Fincher, veteran of such cult favorites as Fight Club and Panic Room, is known for putting out. Zodiac is long (160 minutes), obsessed with tiny evidential details, and the humble owner of only three death sequences, all of which occur within the first hour. The film takes a very sober look at a serial killer, reminding us maybe of Silence of the Lambs. But let's not get too carried away. It is only March, after all.The film begins with the grim, giddy excitement of discovering an emerging serial murderer. Jake Gyllenhaal plays Robert Graysmith, a straight-laced cartoonist at the San Francisco Chronicle, one of the three Bay Area publications that, beginning in October of 1969, Zodiac sent his infamous letters to. Paul Avery, a drunken, goofily arrogant journalist played by Robert Downey Jr., covers the murders, putting himself in the way of Inspector Bill Armstrong (Anthony Edwards) and Inspector David Toschi (Mark Ruffalo), the detectives assigned to the case. After the initial popular craze of the Zodiac plays its course, Mr. Fincher locks the story on the Inspectors' investigation. When they run out of threads and put the case reluctantly down, Mr. Graysmith picks it up, volunteering his own bizarre obsession with the killer.Where Graysmith was meticulous with his evidence in the book, it seems Fincher here was meticulous with every element of this picture. There have been reports of him demanding, in true Kubrick style, seventy or more takes from his actors. The results, despite some disgruntled remarks from Gyllenhaal, are stunning performances from all the main players. Ruffalo, Downey Jr., Gyllenhaal, and Chloe Sevigny as Graysmith's second wife all put up careful, driven performances.Mr. Graysmith's book, also enigmatically titled Zodiac, is essentially a documentation of case files. It's dry and painstakingly thorough (read: a back-of-your-seat, have-to-put-down thriller). And when rumors trickled out that Fincher was going to ridiculous lengths to achieve the same level of accuracymurder sequences are supposedly accurate up to the centimeter in terms of the choreographyI admit to having some worries over the same true crime boredom of the book's adaptation.But thankfully, Screenwriter James Vanderbilt has done a laudable job. As much as Zodiac is about the investigation, it's also about the lives of those obligated and those willing to bring the killer's identity to light. Because of this the film doesn't move like most mystery thrillers do; its pacing is steady and quietly propulsive, allowing the true evidence and mesmerizing reality of the case turn the motor. The thrills swing like mean whispers and arise from the actions of its ultra-dimensional characters.And although Fincher might have chosen a slower, more thoughtful script, he approaches the text with the same urban Gothic loom he's famous for. The camera work tickles the dark, provocative underbelly of San Francisco at that time period, dynamically gliding through black and blue shadows and warm lamplight glow. His portrait of a mystery is wide and solemn and ponderous, but never to be mistaken with boring. Its barbs are sharp and cruelly disturbing at times. Like in The Game, Fight Club, and Se7en before it, Zodiac displays Fincher's enthrallment in our natural obsession with human destruction, be it mental or physical. And as usual, his dissection of this ironic fascination is utterly satisfying.Samuel Osborn",Zodiac

The murder scene at a public park was my favorite as it was so so real and riveting. The issue I had is the script doesn't properly connect Zodiac and the main characters psychologically and so felt boring at parts.

308,kclipper,A true crime masterpiece with impeccable attention to detail,9,7 September 2014,"Director, David Fincher who's dark visionary perspective and methodical storytelling brought us the chilling and gritty serial killer spin-off, ""Se7en"". This time, Fincher's brilliance shines through emphatically with this horrifyingly realistic adaptation of newspaper cartoonist's 1986 true crime novel, ""Zodiac"" that investigated Northern California serial murders during 60's and 70's that remain unsolved to this day. Based on the actual case files and studies, such careful and tedious research went into this underrated film, that every frame is a duplication of the story as it actually happened as far as the facts are concerned according to the author and police reports.The story begins in the Northern California area as an unidentified killer shoots and stabs young residents at random and then continues to taunt law enforcement and the public by sending coded messages to the San Fransisco Chronicle. A young, introverted cartoonist, Robert Graysmith, finely portrayed by Jake Gyllenhaal becomes obsessed with cracking the codes and the identity of the killer by pursuing detectives, primarily chief investigator David Toschi (Mark Ruffalo). Police and journalists continue to be puzzled and exasperated as the ""Zodiac"" killer is able to conceal his identity through various means including his handwriting and physical appearance while blending in undetected and lapsing for sometimes years at a time.This film is so well thought out by Fincher, writer, James Vanderbilt and their producers, that they sculpted the development of the film heavily from interviews with the original San Fransisco bay area detectives, officials and actual surviving victims. Fincher was so obsessed with the details everything down to the landscapes of the murder locations and the clothes that the victims were wearing at the time of the incidents. The cast is in top shape, including Gyllenhaal, Ruffalo, Anthony Edwards, Elias Koteas John Carroll Lynch as the prime suspect and Robert Downey Jr. delivering his witty sarcasm as journalist, Paul Avery. This is true crime film-making at its very best with a slow pace but stark atmosphere, lively soundtrack, and suspenseful and puzzling relationships with complex and engaging characters based on real people and events. Readers of books on true crime like ""Zodiac"" and ""Helter Skelter"" will find this especially interesting, but it should play out as a thought-provoking and entertaining character study for any inquiring mind of unsolved mysteries. Definitely a two thumbs up.",Zodiac

Sure, the serial killings in the California Bay Area was tragic and for all I know, the killer might still on the loose but to torture the movie goer with nothing but a million aimless characters popping up all over the place, running helter skelter from building to building, from block to block, from car to car and each trying to thwart the efforts of one another in trying to find the ID of the maniac, and for CLOSE TO THREE HOURS, was unbearable. The dialogue was dreadful and the astonished look on the puss of Jake ""Robert Graysmith"" Gyllenhaal which is his natural look anyway, adds insult to injury. A cartoonist who looked like a cartoon character.Add to this, a drunken Robert Downey who's speech is so slurred and confusing, I didn't know if he was a sleuth or playing ""Hamlet."" The film is one big ""MELOVAHESS."" Boring, tedious, and annoying. Imagine, a cartoonist having better sleuthing techniques than the entire detective squads of major California cities! The only person to whom I'd recommend this film would be my worst enemy! So heed my words and keep those sheckels for another movie. You'll thank me a million times over.",Zodiac
310,Rawal_Afzal,A very engaging film,9,22 November 2015,"I thought this was quite an intriguing and engaging thriller that very well manages to keep one on his toes.Best of all where some heart-stopping moments, such as the killings shown that the Zodiac killer conducted, and the scene where Robert Graysmith gets a scare in the basement of that man. That almost made my younger sister scream.The good thing about films based on true events is that you can't really point to too many plot-holes, since it is shown as it is in reality, and I suppose this is what makes this feel much more realistic than many of the other mystery killer films.One blot on the film though has to be its length. It is so long that somewhere around in the middle of it the film loses its pace for a while and all the chatter begins to cause headache. It should have been at least 25 minutes shorter than it was.Overall though, a seriously good film.",Zodiac
311,wisemantonofski,A Master-Class in Mystery,10,5 February 2019,"As serial killer based thrillers go, this is one of the more meticulous and thoughtful pieces available. It relies not on the gory reenactments of the killings but more on the work process of those trying to ensnare the killer, creating a crime thriller up to its knees in intrigue and subtlety. The weaving and frustrating course of the investigation, and thusly the plot of the film, works brilliantly to emulate the elusive nature of its subject matter, the killer who was never caught and makes this one of the best directed films of all time. Using an atmospherically dismal San Francisco backdrop to really drive home the suspense and diligent attention to detail in the investigation work, Zodiac truly earns its reputation as one of the greatest crime thrillers of all time",Zodiac
312,Darth_Voorhees,"""Zodiac""",10,3 May 2008,"Zodiac. David Fincher's thriller about the Zodiac Killer is the best film of 2007. The Hitchcockian thriller is alive and well here. Fincher is a master of generating suspense and he creates a dark world for our characters to inhabit. Zodiac tells the story of how the infamous Zodiac serial killer who terrorized the San Francisco area in the early 70's effected the lives of four men. Jake Gyllenthal plays Robert Graysmith a man who is deeply troubled and somewhat morbidly fascinated by the case. Graysmith is a political cartoonist for the San Francisco Chronicle who received letters threatening letters and ciphers which Zodiac claimed to have his identity concealed in. Graysmith takes an interest in the case and as time goes by he becomes obsessed with tracking down the killer to the point where his wife leaves him. The screenplay is smart, it doesn't try to make a Hannibal Lector out of Zodiac. Fincher doesn't try to solve the case he uses the fact that no arrests were made in the Zodiac case to his advantage. Here the pursuit is just as thrilling as coming face to face with the villain. Zodiac also shows how crime can affect the psyche of the people involved. We don't have an over the top CSI approach to police work, we see what really happens with real detectives. The movie has four Academy Award worthy performances . Mark Ruffalo gives an outstanding performance as Dave Toschi the homicide detective assigned to the case. We see how he becomes mentally exhausted by his inability to find the killer. Robert Downey Jr is Paul Avery an eccentric Chronicle reporter who attacks Zodiac in his editorials. The most crucial performance in the movie though comes from Jake Gyllenthal as Graysmith. Graysmith is a character who is foreign to crime scenes that Toschi sees on an everyday basis but he becomes drawn to the case because he feels that someone should bring Zodiac to justice even after the evidence disappears and the case becomes cold. Rarely do we get a thriller as exciting as this. Zodiac is easily one of the best films of the new millennium.",Zodiac
313,pangipingu,Captivating!,8,27 December 2020,"I was a teenager when I first watched Zodiac. I remember that I liked it back then, but not as much as I do now. At the time, I was unaware of many details behind the story and couldn't appreciate the meticulous way Fincher portrays them all.",Zodiac
314,blackburnj-1,The fruits of obsession,9,5 February 2008,"Do you want to see a film about a serial killer with no solid conclusion? David Fincher does, so he made it. That is a little unfair, but essentially that is the genesis of this film.David Fincher was a young boy in San Francisco when the Zodiac killer started to strike. He can distinctly recall the little articles of fear that floated throughout the city and when he wasn't allowed to go on the school bus because his mother was too afraid for his safety. It is something that Fincher has, to an extent, obsessed about. How apt then that this film should be such a detailed and effective study of obsession.Jake Gyllenhaal's Robert Graysmith is an awkward character, a good man but unusual. However, when his paper, the San Francisco Chronicle, receives teasing ciphers from the Zodiac killer, he, an outsider in the paper's hierarchy, becomes more and more interested and more and more obsessed. He descends from a man who likes solving crossword puzzles to a man utterly determined to solve one of the most complex and notorious unsolved crimes in US history. It is utterly compelling to watch.Fincher evokes the period of the late sixties and early seventies with ease. The film is perfectly designed and at many points ingeniously shot. He creates tension brilliantly. The fear that soaks into the city and the characters is almost tangible and the sheer horror of the few murders that are shown serves to enhance this. Some sequences are genuinely terrifying, and yet nothing happens in them. Examples like this show Fincher to be a master.He is supported in his efforts by an intelligent script delivered by a pitch perfect cast. James Vanderbilt's screenplay is responsible. It ends with a bit of speculation but all of the events that are crucial to the case happened and you get the sense that this is a fair representation. He provides detailed characters that the talented performers devour with ease. Mark Ruffalo delivers a truly fine performance. Robert Downey Jnr. does one of his usual mumbling but somehow gripping supporting roles (gripping mainly because you're straining to her what he's saying). However, Jake Gyllenhaal is, once again, the standout. He really has developed into one of the world's finest actors and has a rich and varied career ahead of him.This is one of the finest thrillers of 2007, a really interesting, entertaining and gripping work. It outshines the slightly surreal nature of ""Fight Club"" and is a masterclass in film-making from one of contemporary cinema's often unappreciated greats. But this is more than just a simple thriller. It is an exploration of one of humanity's most perplexing traits: obsession. And who better to do it than an obsessive.",Zodiac
315,CihanVercan,"A still Open Serial Killer Case at the end, a failure of Act of Justice",7,22 September 2008,"It's a two and a half an hour long movie, but this is not the thing that makes the Zodiac boring; it's the non-stopping phone ring rings! We, the viewers, kept yelling ""Somebody please answer the phone!"" all the time, since more than half of the movie took place at the newspaper agency. Instead of playing a cool mob music at the sound background, for some reason or other the sound crew keep ringing the office phones. Especially when you consider those phones are the 1960s' grandma phones with the most nerve-racking ringing melody.Collecting the whole factual news regarding the Zodiac killer, director Fincher serves us a still open serial killer case. Detectives and newspaper crew join hands together to solve the mystery which Zodiac left after. The detectives even caught the right killer once, though after his interrogation he was released for the deficiencies of evidence. Years passed by and only one detective remained involving with the case. Everyone else quit, everyone else gave in. He froze his research and let time go by. Then a cartoonist appears, who seemed like he was having fun from the game at the beginning. Yet the cartoonist took every detail seriously, collected and manipulated every useful information and combined each clue together. Finally, he resolved the Zodiac mystery; and found out the criminal. When he stated the name of whom he found, the detective begins helping him coming to the same culmination he came years ago: The criminal is distinct. He is known identically. However, there is still no sufficient evidence. At that point, act of justice fails.The ending connects with the reality: The Zodiac case is still open. The criminal is not yet caught because of the deficiencies of evidence. All we need to have is someone like Sherlock Holmes. This case needed Sherlock Holmes. Zodiac, the movie, needed a hero detective to detect the necessary evidence. Regrettably, Fincher didn't think the same way we thought. He took an empty pride in leaving a case open and a criminal uncaught, to show us a failure of Act of Justice.",Zodiac
316,edwardrevans,Much better than Summer of Sam..But could do better,7,11 July 2008,"As in my summary this movie is better than ""Summer of Sam"" which is completely disengaging and uninformative, historical works need to make sense which Zodiac does. Anyway the beauty of this movie is that it deals with the known facts about the Zodiac Killer and does not put its own interpretation or conclusions, it lets you decide.The movie is well shot and does a good job of capturing the time period covered, you can clearly see the strain of investigating the murders on the performance Jake Gyllenhaal, (""Robert Graysmith""), as it consumes him and has an effect on his personal life. On the Negative side the sound and dialogue is hard to follow at times and there are too many throw away remarks,especially from the Character ""Inspector David Toschi"", mumbling through the first 3/4's of the film, only speaking clearly at its conclusion, this in my opinion should have been addressed in post production. The supporting cast play there parts well, all giving a commendable performance without and wooden acting.Finally however this movie merits it 7/10..",Zodiac
317,MacAindrais,Who's the Hurdy Gurdy Man?,10,25 March 2007,"Zodiac (2007) ****Zodiac is a great procedural film that focuses not so much on the crimes of the infamous killer, but the meticulous and frustrating search for him. This is, I think, Fincher's best film. He's is back in the serial killer genre, and he one up's his other near masterpiece Seven. This is a long movie, clocking in at almost 3 hours, but it's never boring. Fincher doesn't overplay the violence, but he doesn't underplay it as well - the murders are brutal, made all the more so by the fact that Fincher manages to make them seem incredibly authentic. Essentially all of the violence is out of the way in the first hour, and then it turns head on into the frustrating process of trying to catch a killer who it turned out to be impossible to catch.. Gyllenhaal is listed as the main character, and he for the most part is, but the films narrative jumps around between Graysmith and the police, headed up by Mark Ruffalo in a career best performance as Dave Toschi. Robert Downy Jr and Anthony Edwards also give some great performances.Even though the big ""scares"" are out of the way early, Fincher finds ways to add tension to the small moments, which are very nice. Even though Gyllenhaal doesn't quite have the right look in my opinion, he does give a good performance that despite doubts was believable enough. The films huge strength is in its great story telling, and very solid direction from Fincher. He doesn't resort to the camera tricks of his past films, but he works some great cinematography in a more subtle and far more effective way. Not to mention a great soundtrack used the perfection.Zodiac is one of the best American films so far this year, and even though it's not making a big box office splash, looks for this one to garner a lasting reputation.4/4",Zodiac
318,Ajtlawyer,excellent,9,4 March 2007,"I'd read Graysmith's book a couple of times and therefore knew quite a bit about the investigation. ZODIAC didn't take any liberties with the story, as far I could tell. In fact, it went to great lengths to be realistic, to the point where the murders depicted in the movie were all filmed at the locations of the real murders---the murder at the lake was even filmed on the exact same day of the year. I believe the two surviving victims were consultants for the movie.Robert Downey, Jr. steals the movie and his take as reporter Paul Avery descending into alcoholism and drug use might have been too close to reality for Downey. It is way too early but Downey should be remembered when it comes time to bounce around actors worthy of Oscar consideration next year, he's that good in this movie.",Zodiac
319,emryse,I loved this Film :),8,8 February 2021,"A couple months ago I saw this article talking about one of the Zodiac's ciphers being solved 51 years after it was made. At the time I had never heard of the Zodiac Killer but I was intrigued and instantly went to Wikipedia to read about it. The story I read was fascinating but after I'd read the Wikipedia article I felt like I had learnt a bit but there wasn't much more to learn about, that is until now when, one day when scrolling through Netflix, I saw the film. I watched it and it did not let me down, it was far more interesting than the article I'd read but also so accurate to the information I'd seen. I loved Jake Gyllenhaal's character and how he was tortured by this puzzle, letting it envelop his life, I loved how gory the killing scenes were when, at times I'd have to look away, the suspense was amazing and all the actors were top notch. This movie, while definitely dark, was just a lot of fun to watch. One of my favourite elements of the movie was how everyone who was involved with the case, Mark Ruffalo, Robert Downey Jr, Jake Gyllenhaal were enveloped by it and you see that for years it impacts their life.I'm not sure how accurate this film was to real life but I whole heartedly recommend it.",Zodiac
320,frankwhat,"""Zodiac""  A Favorable Sign",8,3 March 2007,"I knew a good amount about this case going into the film as I always found the famous serial killer ones very interesting when I'd see a TV special about them on. It's also no secret that it's one of the few that went unsolvable to this day, so I really didn't know what to expect from a thriller that pretty much everyone already knows how it'll end. However ""Zodiac"" was made with a style that allowed the perspective to seem fresh, even if it ultimately wasn't. This is a must see for any true lover of real police work that gets down to the nitty-gritty of what detectives have to go through in actuality. No one's job is glamorized and in fact it's portrayed as the other way aroundpeople get fired, demoted, or simply go flat out crazy. What fascinated me so much about the 'Zodiac Killer' more than the other murderers I've heard about was how he kept changing his methods, which is the main reason why he was able to elude capture for so long. All in all this made for one excellent cinematic puzzle that remained that way.The biggest surprise of this movie was that David Fincher directed it. Even though he doesn't come out with many new filmswith the exception of maybe ""Panic Room"", those that he does direct are both highly innovative and entertaining. However this effort strayed away from the beaten path and was very different from the type of flick he usually churns out, which turned out to be a worthy venture. While I still prefer the likes of ""Seven"" and ""Fight Club"", this was close to them in overall quality. So much detail was taken into account when recreating the time period and crimes. Even though the film was shot digitally they edited it so the appearance had a grainy texture as it did back in the 70's. Also the costumes, settings, modes of transportation, and everything else was matched to a T.The acting was strictly topnotch here and the biggest kudos goes to Robert Downey Jr. He was absolutely amazing! It's sad that he's at his best when he's playing a character that gets lost in a world of drugs and alcohol as his life has imitated this art for quite some time. Nevertheless he was so amusing to watch and added a playful quirkiness to Paul Avery that I don't think it would've been possible to play him any better. While Robert easily stole the show, a very honorable mention was Mark Ruffalo. He did quite well too and while he usually does, this went above and beyond what he's normally capable of. It's evident that as decent as Mark always has been in the past, there's always room for improvement. Everyone else put in great turns too, and there wasn't a single performance that came close to being unbelievable.Potential viewers should also be warned, this film isn't for everybody. There are a few very disturbing sequences, that while they aren't even terribly graphicstill manage to be creepy beyond belief due to their realism pertaining to the sheer coldness in which they're displayed. Another factor is the 160-minute running time, which except for the first third when the actual killings are taking place, quickly starts dragging on following that. All the facts had to be included though, so it really couldn't have been much shorter without losing its potency. You also have to remain open-minded if you watch it and can't demand any kind of closure except for what you can conclude on your own; otherwise you'll leave awfully disappointed. Finally it can be argued that only one viewpoint is being showed here and that is the author's, this automatically leads to a bias. I personally think it's the most logical account of events, but if you want an impartial take on what went down, your best bet is to watch a documentary on the history of events that took place.It's very scary to think that such a gruesome individual could go about undetected for so long and that we'll never get to find out the real answer on who it was behind everything. Fincher's latest contribution is a compelling view for all those with strong stomachs and was eerily refreshing compared to what junk has been streaming out of Hollywood lately. There are many notable guest appearances and is quite simply a well-done movie, even if it did get hammed up a little bit. I personally am going to avoid secluded places for awhilejust in case my astrological sign reads anywhere near the same as it did for all the poor victims.",Zodiac
321,IamROCKAS,"Careers, marriages, even sanity fall victim to obsession in this manhunt thriller.",8,16 October 2020,"As an auteur, David Fincher's work is instantly recognizable as he is a meticulous director. He is known to put his actors through more than 100 takes to get the results he's after. His filmmaking process always begins with extensive research and preparation and it's evident as most of his movies are like a Swiss watch as all the pieces are so beautifully machined. Films that are directed by him distinctly dark, claustrophobic, innovative, and thought-provoking - with an aftertaste that lingers, or even scars (may I say - like a chemical burn. This one is for all the Fight Club fans here). One element of Fincher's visual style is the specific way in which he uses tilt, pan and track in the camera movements. The camera moves when the character moves and stops at exactly the moment they stop. This applies not just to sprints and strides, but also to the slightest changes in countenance. He also favors the use of wide-angle shots to showcase a character's environment. That kind of attention to details is evident in Se7en and Fight club, which are among my favourite films of all time but Zodiac doesn't fall far behind, so let's discuss Fincher's take on the Zodiac killer.The movie doesn't exaggerate or glamorize the real-life events - in fact, it fictionalizes and even dramatizes them. It doesn't offer the illusion of resolution, nor the structural organization that comes from us knowing how the story will inedibly end and what needs to be shown. The story of the unsolved series of murders that paralyzed the Bay Area in the late '60s and early '70s by the Zodiac killer is infamous and people outside the area have heard about these events that are talked about to this day. It mainly takes place in mundane world of the journalists and cops who try to crack this case open. We get a well-argued scenario on the possible identity of the Zodiac. As most of the killing take place early on in the movie, the greater part of the story was actually centered around the investigation by both the cops and the journalist, alongside an obsessed cartoonist. Though moments of suspense are relieved with humor at times, a sense of urgent tension floods Zodiac-a feeling purveyed by the filmmaking a strong case against a single suspect, yet how those involved can do nothing to detain him. The investigation starts hitting one dead-end after another and we can see how the morale of each party is slowly decreasing. One of my favorite moments probably was when the cartoonist visits Bob Vaughn and slowly begins to suspect that Bob is the killer. The sheer panic that consumes him is both stressful to witness and intense to experience. When ""Not many people have basements in California"" was uttered, I'm pretty sure me and most of the viewers gasped, realizing what conclusion the cartoonist has come to in his head. There's also a moment in the movie when the cartoonist comes face to face with the man he believes is the notorious serial, a man he has been hunting obsessively for years. He can do nothing but stare in horror at the unfathomable evil before him... and the actor makes it one of the most quietly spellbinding moments I've seen on film in ages. Fincher, the mad genius that he is, managed to create a lot of suspense early on and just when it started to fade, he brought the intensity back at the precise moment for me to not lose my interest.As he weaves a complex network of clues, case details, and uncertain feeling about suspects for his audience and investigators to ponder, Fincher implants an undercurrent of ambiguousness. There is no closure, no arrest, no return to our safe little world, as our protagonists find out. There are three actors that take turns in the spotlight, as the film shifts its emphasis over the course of its 158-minute running time: the journalist Paul Avery, who covered the story for San Francisco's Chronicle, played by the one and only Mr. Stark Robert Downey Jr.; the cartoonist Robert Graysmith, who became obsessed with the case and later wrote the book upon which the movie is based, played by the same guy who portrayed Donnie Darko in Donnie Darko (2001) - Jake Gyllenhaal; the detective, heading the investigation, who will come to portray Bruce Banner in the Marvel Cinematic Universe - Mark Ruffalo. Each man becomes, in some way, burned-out or driven mad by the pursuit of Zodiac. They are not noble heroes; they sacrifice their families and jobs for a burning desire to continue searching. Avery's sanity took a nose-dive and he quit the Chronicle. Toschi got kicked off homicide division after suspicions of forging a Zodiac letter. Graysmith's life is consumed by the case, he loses his job at the Chronicle, and his wife takes the kids and leaves as she fears the Zodiac may be targeting their family. All of them could be guilty of fishing for connection because the wanted one lead to be the killer. In the end, Zodiac's level of closure depends on what we feel to be true, as opposed to what we can prove.Like an infection that is aggregative and spreads faster than one can control it, Fincher's Zodiac is quite catchy and the ride is enjoyable. Pursuing this case further is a challenge even for modern forensics, which leaves the film leaving us with intentionally incomplete details but the movie never feels like a documentary or anything less than a well shot and acted motion picture. I feel like I'm infected with what I need to know about this notorious serial killer and I was left with a lingering sense of unsatisfied obsession that stayed with my long after the final shots.",Zodiac

323,simonparker1990,A Killer of a Movie,10,18 May 2007,"David Fincher is to date one of my favourite directors of all time. From his admittedly shaky, but not even remotely his fault, start with Alien 3, to the good, but not amazing Panic Room, I've always found him brilliant. Admiteddly his first, and the last movie I saw, Panic Room, were not his strongest movies. No, his strongest have to be Seven, and of course Fight Club, which is definitely in my top ten movies of all time. Yet I wasn't very excited over the movie Zodiac. I liked the fact Fincher was directing it, but my worry was the fact the trailer looked dull. And nothing really stood out to me whatsoever. Add to that the fact that Zodiac is pushing three hours, and I was actually at times dreading seeing it at the cinema. However, after being forced by a friend, I agreed to go see it today. And boy am I glad he convinced me to go with him, while Zodiac might not be able to stand tall amongst Seven and Fight Club, it is still the best movie I have seen all year, and it is a movie that will stay long in memory. It is not an easy going movie at all, and a lot of it is about talking, yet the talking is infectious and you just get sucked into the conversations, you begin seeing things differently, everyone is a suspect, and you try and piece everything together in your head. But it is the actual killings themselves that will haunt your nightmares for the longest, while they are not gory, they are shockingly horrific. The scene at the lake is horrific to watch, but its a later scene, involving a child and its mother, that will haunt me longest. I won't give it away, but the very idea of it just made me feel very ill. Zodiac however is not a movie about the killings, they are a subplot in reality, the actual movie follows the obsessions of the men who tried to catch the Zodiac killer. And it is this story that works the best.The performances of Zodiac are easily one of its best features. Jake Gylenhaal is an actor that I've always found to be very talented, however it wasn't until I saw him in this movie that I really came to appreciate just how very talented he is. His character is easily likable, and he goes through many changes throughout the movie. But his character and performance is still top notch. Robert Downey Jr easily steals every single scene that he is in. His character is also very likable, but he also gets the very best lines of the movie. But the surprise performance here comes from Mark Ruffalo, who I have never really appreciated all that much. Yet here, here I really think he should win an Oscar for his performance. He is simply brilliant, had it not have been for Robert Downey Jr he would have ran away with the movie. Its Ruffalo's later scenes that work the very best, and it makes his character very memorable. Brian Cox delivers a brilliant performance as a smaller character, and Chloë Sevigny delivers an honest and memorable performance as Melanie.The pacing of Zodiac, and running length, is going to be perhaps the biggest issue for a lot of people. Admiteddly my one fault for Zodiac is the fact that it does feel just that little bit too long. It never made me enjoy the movie less, but I did see an awful lot of people checking their mobiles for the time come the final half hour. The pacing of the movie also does not allow a lot of viewers to enjoy it as much as they might have done. The movie starts with a bang, and it continues to give a lot of big bangs for the next half hour. The trouble is, for the next hour and a bit it revolves entirely around the case, and not really the killings themselves. This is where a lot of people will get frustrated as this is where the movie requires patience. If you do have patience, and can sit and happily watch the cases and different suspects, then you will find Zodiac a complete masterpiece as I did, but if you get uptight over a lot of talking then you will get frustrated as my friend did. The ending manages to bring in more morph to it, but by that stage I was already content with the movie.The atmosphere of Zodiac is possibly the biggest success of the movie. There are scenes that are executed with such skill and precision that you will sit there and your heart will thump like crazy. Any scene with a car in a deserted area is bound to terrify you. The opening sequence is initially creepy, later sequences, especially one in a basement, is really nail bitingly tense. The look and feel of the movie also makes the movie work to its full extent. It does feel like a period movie, and the score really gives it that extra feel as well.Overall Zodiac is a truly masterful piece of cinema, as I've said not everyone will get it, many I suspect will find it boring. But for those of you willing to give it a try, and willing to have patience with it, then you will be vastly rewarded. Its a movie that deserves to be seen multiple times, as you will never truly appreciate how good this movie is until you've seen it quite a few times.",Zodiac

325,Monotreme02,"A taught thriller, fantastic story and brilliantly crafted by Fincher",10,3 August 2007,"After a 5-year hiatus during which he returned to his television roots directing commercials, David Fincher is back and it looks like his past few years of experimentation with digital photography have paid off  with Zodiac, Fincher delivers what is easily his most satisfying work since Fight Club, and what is definitely one of the finest and most unique films of his career.In Zodiac, Fincher does something that he hasn't yet achieved in any of his other works: he engages himself in the story. And what a fantastic story it is. Viewing this, one has no problem seeing where Fincher and screenwriter Andrew Kevin Walker drew from to make Se7en. But the clear and present difference between the two films is that, as sleek, engaging and entertaining as Se7en is, it's nothing more than entertainment. We all know that in the real world a criminal investigation never lasts for such a short period of time as a week. Se7en also engages itself in your usual run-of-the-mill Hollywood storytelling techniques  young rookie detective teams up with old, edge-of-retirement detective for one last case and the whole story ends in a dramatic showdown. Quite on the contrary, Zodiac takes the far more realistic angle. One could even say that it is the quintessential crime investigation film  an epic story spanning over 3 decades and still not meeting a completely final resolution. There is no dramatic peak. The move constantly jumps weeks, months and even years forward in time. The justice system is a slow, bureaucratic process. Not everyone gets to do what he or she wants and how he or she wants to do it. And within all the facts and suspects and leads and investigations, Fincher even has time to find the root and heart of his main characters. He chooses wisely not to indulge in any exposition for the characters  we learn about them, about their lives, their mannerisms and their clockwork as the movie progresses.The acting is absolutely superb all around. Jake Gyllenhaal, who has already sealed his place as one of the most promising young actors with Brokeback Mountain and Jarhead, delivers a restrained and un-showy performance. The same goes for Mark Ruffalo, Chloe Sevigny and many of the other principal cast members. They all achieve what is most difficult for an actor to achieve: they disappear into their characters, just as Fincher disappears into the film's plot and story. The one real standout, as usual, is Robert Downey, Jr. His role in this film is added to a series of recent film roles of his that just further and further fuel my adoration towards him. He is quick, witty, hilarious and irresistible to watch, while also managing to take these characteristics so easily identifiable with him and applying them to his character. It's no wonder he's one of my favourite actors.In terms of style, although Fincher directs this with restraint that's not to say that the film completely lacks it. Fincher and cinematographer Harris Savides utilize natural but highly stylized lighting. Fincher's camera still manages to capture beautiful shots, and the use of digital video allows the night sequences to show up better and crisper than they possibly could on film, considering the use of natural lighting and deep focus Fincher employs. But the real achievement in the film is Fincher's restraint; his ability to give the film a stylish and sleek look without ever letting the cinematography to become so showy that it just completely takes over.In all the film has very high production value on all the technical planes. Fincher utilizes the very best set and costume design work to accurately recreate the time periods, and his perfectionist nature makes sure to see to every last detail. A soundtrack of pop songs is also utilized fantastically to recreate the periods, and in all Fincher's relentless attention to detail pays off well. Of course his direction is greater than ever and perhaps more dominant here than in any of his films  the recreations of the Zodiac murders are ominous and chilling to the bone while Fincher avoids using any cheap tricks.I have thought about it extensively and I just can't see why this film performed so poorly at the box office. Perhaps it was the bad choice of a release date  in a time slot usually reserved for the studios' shameful failures and holdovers from the previous year's Oscar hopefuls, perhaps the movie going audience wasn't ready for an unprecedented movie such as this one. Taking notes directly from Alan J. Pakula's All the President's Men, Fincher manages to create with Zodiac a long and epic film based extensively on exposition, dialogue and phone conversations, featuring a murder case so puzzling it still leaves you asking questions and trying to follow leads after the movie is over, that despite all that remains relentlessly entertaining. A taught thriller, a fantastic story and script and brilliant execution from Fincher, this is the best work he has brought us in a long time, and so far probably the best movie of the first half of the year",Zodiac

327,TheSeaLion,A roller coaster of suspense,10,31 July 2013,"Based around a string of actual murders in the years of 1968-1969, ""Zodiac"" follows the journey of Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal) and David Toschi (Mark Ruffalo) as they try to discover the identity of the elusive serial killer who has begun sending letters to the police department with embedded information. The film succeeds as the reincarnation of an actual event on film and as an original idea for a film. If the Zodiac murders never took place, this would be an exceptional and ingenious mystery drama, but since they did happen, it still does well as the reincarnation of the events of film.The performances given by Gyllenhaal, Ruffalo, and Robert Downey Jr. (Paul Avery) are superb and they give it their all. Other honorable mentions include Anthony Edwards (William Armstrong), and John Carroll Lynch (Arthur Leigh Allen).Using the elements of visuals, the suspense skyrockets by using elements from a gloomy day to a sudden noise to a plain creepy setting to build suspense up in the audience. They use every trick in the book except not showing us who the killer is and if he is lurking nearby to get us fearful that the killer might have his next victim.",Zodiac
328,The-Social-Introvert,Quickie Review: Zodiac,8,21 January 2016,"I can understand why Zodiac could be frustrating to some viewers, as it doesn't really follow the usual structure of murder mystery cop thrillers, and it's pretty different from Fincher's previous thrillers. But this is the film that I believe is the director's best work so far. The film has a kind of creepy and unsettling atmosphere made all the more eerie by the fact that knowing what you're seeing actually happened. There is a dark and moody vibe throughout. The opening murders were fascinatingly recreated and it was very interesting watching the police work that went on throughout the film. Sidney Lumet would be proud. The actors shine: Jake Gyllenhaal as the inquisitive cartoonish, Robert Downey Jr. before he became Tony Stark, and Mark Ruffalo and Philip Baker Hall give good turns also. I thought the digital cinematography was ugly at times, especially in the opening scenes, though I got used to it eventually. I'm a great believer in period movies being shot on films, otherwise it usually looks really weird and documentary-like (see Public Enemies). It must be tricky making films that are based on true stories. You have to stick close to what happened in real life whilst making your movie entertaining for the viewer. Fincher managed to do this, I believe. A lot of research has clearly gone into this, and the filmmakers clearly tell you who they believe the Zodiac killer was whilst leaving the question open. The lengthy runtime allows for periods of the film to be dedicated to smaller, quieter moments which are often used to build atmosphere or to showcase police work. Overall this was a thoroughly satisfying thriller.Best Scene: ""This is the Zodiac speaking""",Zodiac

This was finally the time to meet the unwanted reference face-to-face, especially that the picture has such a powerful cast.""Based on a true story"" is a label that instantly tries to catch your attention, make the things livelier and creeps into the consciousness as something very possible hiding just out the window. Here we follow the trail of a killer that intrigues the police with an unusual manner, communicating his intentions to the whole nation to be in the spotlight. His criminal activity is not totally horrifying, the shivers come from the twisty delivery and a unique performance of a sickly evil mind.The first half of the movie is dragging slowly not unraveling the full potential of the characters and this is the reason that gets you down, although the story is sticky as honey for the flies. As soon as the peen hits the locked and loaded detective line, the picture shoots loudly and potently, stirring up the viewer and swallows the attention immediately. The curiosity of the characters transmits to you and the wish to know the truth poisons your blood as the venom of a cobra, leaving no choice other than give in to the process.The most engaging part of the movie was the plot; the acting didn't upset but it wasn't enticing. Sometimes the editing gave chills and pushed that real-life terror sharpening your senses to the edge of panic.Closing the case, I would say that 'Zodiac' is a quite appealing representative of a crime thriller but doesn't have that particular charm to stay with you after turning it off.",Zodiac
330,commandercool88,Subtle Darkness,9,30 March 2007,"More than a decade after 'Seven' put David Fincher's name on the big stage, the visionary director returns to the same subject that brought such success. Serial killers. 'Zodiac', a mature and brooding film, reaccounts one of our country's most tantalizing unsolved mysteries. Who was the Zodiac killer? Fincher sets out to answer that very question, and in doing so, creates a masterpiece of epic proportions.It's 1969, and the country will soon be captivated by the actions of one, villainous man. The Zodiac killer. Over the period of several years, this mysterious figure will terrorize San Francisco and surrounding areas. Brutally, yet flawlessly, taking the lives of his victims, he will repeatedly elude investigators. It's lowly cartoonist Robert Graysmith, who works at the San Fransisco Chronicle to which the Zodiac has been writing letters to, who will become obsessed with the case and the unknown face behind it all. With the help of Paul Avery, a newspaper editor who becomes 'blacklisted' by the Zodiac, and David Toschi, a local investigator looking into possible leads in the case, Graysmith will embark on a more than decade long effort to unmask the uncatchable killer.For David Fincher, whose resume includes 'Seven', 'Fight Club', and 'Panic Room', 'Zodiac' marks a new step in Fincher's already terrific career. While 'Zodiac' may not be Fincher's best piece of work, it's certainly his most mature and accomplished effort to date. Subtle and low-key, it's a film that doesn't offer many answers, yet leaves you unnerved and disturbed because of its own murkiness. Topping 160 minutes, 'Zodiac' remains a taut and steady-paced film that rarely stumbles. It could have been edited down to a more economical length, but being the precise man that he is, Fincher does what he does for a reason. And I sure as hell won't question his motives. Because at its best, 'Zodiac' works as a suspense-ridden and edge-of-your-seat thriller. And at other times, a smart sharp-witted drama. It perfectly conveys its atmosphere of fear and unease, and don't doubt that you'll cast a glance or two over your shoulder coming out of the theater. 'Zodiac' is a sweeping masterpiece. Beautifully shot, the cinematography manages spectacular shots of San Francisco that captures the look and feel of the time.'Zodiac' catches much of its cast at the height of their respectable careers. With Jake Gyllenhaal, Mark Ruffalo, and Robert Downey Jr., it's hard to distinguish who is superior. Gyllenhaal can add 'Zodiac' to his already impressive list of films that includes 'Donnie Darko', 'Brokeback Mountain', and 'October Sky'. Gyllenhaal's take as a man obsessed with a case seemingly out of his hands allows the audience, who is on the same page as Gyllenhaal despite possibly knowing the outcome, to connect the dots alongside Robert Graysmith. 'Zodiac' also finds Ruffalo at the top of his game, who is slick and sharp in his performance as an investigator who is slowly watching the baffling case slip beneath the cracks. And it's great to see Robert Downey continue his rebound. After an impressive performance in 'Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang', Downey plays the amusing newspaper editor who descends down a slipper slope when he gets the attention of the Zodiac himself. A terrific ensemble, each of the film's players disappear into their characters who are but pawns in the Zodiac's villainous scheme.A faithful interpretation of a frustrating crime, 'Zodiac' is made all the more frustrating for those who know its unsettling conclusion. David Fincher continues to be a breath of fresh air, a meticulous storyteller who mixes style and substance with compelling results. It's Fincher the way we like him, fine-tuned and creating a subtly haunting film. 'Zodiac' may not have in store for us a grand and explosive finale, but the end result is a rewarding payoff for those who take the journey.",Zodiac
331,Michael Kenmore,Best movie of 2007 at the earliest. David Fincher's masterpiece of tense mystery suspense drama,10,20 March 2007,"Prefacing the review, here is an anecdote of David Fincher's complaint about his experience working on the film set of Alien 3: ""There's no one who hated Alien3 more than I did... I got hired for a personal vision and was railroaded into something else. I had never been devalued or lied to or treated so badly. I wasn't used to adults lying to me. I didn't read a script for a year and a half after that. I thought I'd rather die of colon cancer than do another movie."" (Excerpt from ""The Allure of Decay"" by Amy Taubin Sight and Sound, January 1996)16 years later, David had a similar battle with the studio trying to keep the film running at the uncompromised theatrical cut length he felt would be right. The previous cut ran 3 hours and ten minutes. And the result is the studio's poor treatment of the film ""Zodiac"" with lackluster marketing (including deceptive trailer that sent the ignorant young people to the movies expecting a blood-splashing slasher horror-thriller, much to their chagrin and disgust) and withdrawn Oscar campaign.In spite of this, David have finally made a masterpiece that is so unique and completely otherworldly that it's a mind-bendingly absorbing movie-going experience.I didn't like Fincher's other films, including the nauseatingly disturbing Seven (I can never forget how vitriol my father was in expressing his loathing of the movie and warned me not to see it because he said it made him feel genuinely ill when I was a teenager; I concurred with him although the film had its merits despite black ending) and self-consciously smug & perversely indulgent Fight Club. The Game was meant to be seen only once. Panic Room didn't hold up well -- his weakest film so far, with a trademark lousy ending. Alien 3 is the most fascinating movie in the Alien franchise for its bizarre, unconventional, depressingly pessimistic storytelling and troubled production that is eventually redeemed by the assembly cut edition. Alien 3 theatrical cut opened my eyes to David Fincher as the truly promising new director (despite the studio's butchery in editing room) whose demonstrable proof of his prodigious film-making talent was mind-blowing, to say the least.This time Mr. Fincher tried his hand at directing a true crime drama and he have proved himself to be an absolutely adept and astonishingly talented filmmaker with the eyes for the mood and creepily disturbing atmosphere in masterful cinematography utilizing drab brown-orange-black color hues to full effect and ears for the music and sound effects that get under the unsuspecting viewers' skin to scare the crap out of them.I will not say a word about the plot, because the less the viewer know when he/she go in, the better. But it is about facing the true banality of evil from the viewer's perspective which have a strange effect on the viewer that make it a weirdly tense, intoxicatedly gripping and at times frighteningly creepy experience. This is why we go to the movies to experience the riveting drama and emotions, folks.If the viewer do not expect a flashy movie and can actually appreciate the merits of an intricate murder mystery drama heavy on dialogues as the pivot of suspense & character development (anyone who enjoyed taut suspense thrillers i.e. The Day of the Jackal, All the President's Men and The Insider), all the better. This is not a typical movie that have the camera shots flying all over with rapid cuts and loud music effects. Quite the contrary despite the semi-misleading movie trailer.The actual movie subliminally request the viewers to pay attention and have some patience -- it's not slow-moving with filler moments, but the very essence of the story politely demand the viewers to surrender their selfish pretension upon start of the movie's beginning and let the vision roll over them in the course of over two hours and a half.I'm taken aback that given Mr. Fincher's background in music video directing, he's restrained in the pretentiously cool visual effects and power cut flashes that other film directors of similar background (and yes, Tony Scott included) love to throw at the audience. Instead, Fincher let the story unfold itself through mood, dialogue, linear plot and editing, stellar acting by the leads & supports and subtlety of extraordinary cinematography and stunning visual effects.The story is so dense I had to watch the movie two times within two days to absorb. It was unbelievably (although only a few slow spots that are thankfully brief) riveting for its storytelling power coupled with top-notch production values, which obviously cost high sums of money.Zodiac is tragically under-appreciated as a commercial flop due to the majority of the audience's disdain out of short-attention-span impatience, dissatisfaction and ignorance. Almost every great film suffer audience lashing (including 2001: A Space Odyssey -- recollect Rock Hudson's grumble as he walks out on the aisle at the premiere screening ""Will someone tell me what the hell this is about?!?"").Mark my word, Zodiac will stand the test of time as viewer appreciation grow and it will be seen as a great movie. The same screening where I saw this film twice was nearly empty, with only a middle-aged couple and an unaccompanied elderly lady in her 70's the first time, and elderly couple in their 70's or 80's (they look really old) the second time. All of them liked the film.I am only a 28 years old man. I felt humbled by their patient & enjoyable presence -- Zodiac the movie receiving the respect through appreciation for the conveyance of top quality film art as entertainment that also rivet & educate.Major kudos to the visual effects artists for the jaw-dropping shots of the overhead camera shot of a yellow taxi cruising through the streets and the meticulously laid time-lapse construction of Transamerica tower.**** out of four",Zodiac
332,das417,A Story of Murder and Obsession,8,26 July 2007,"The Zodiac killer is one of the most perplexing mysteries in American History. The Zodiac left a trail of fear and death for over two years from 1968 to 1970 with at least five killed and perhaps more though police were never able to link other deaths to the Zodiac. Just as he suddenly appeared he disappeared without a trace and left a scared and confused state behind. It was his name, the Zodiac, which stood for the mysterious killer who was known for sending in codes to various San Francisco papers which contained threats and promises of further murder. It was that combination that made the Zodiac standout as a particularly violent and dangerous murderer. Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a young, single father who works as a cartoonist with the San Francisco Chronicle. When the murders begin he is one of many who is drawn to the mysterious codes being since to the Chronicle and other papers in San Francisco. Along with crime reporter Paul Avery (Ropert Downey Jr.), Robert begins a personal quest of his own to discover the identity of the Zodiac while Inspector David Toschi(Mark Ruffalo) along with his partner Inspector William Armstrong (Anthony Edwards) investigate directly with the SFPD. Robert, Paul, and David will especially find their lives turned upside down as the search for the Zodiac lasts not just months but years. Turning into an obsession for each of them that affects their lives in unexpected ways.And that is what makes Zodiac standout in the field of crime movies. Instead of focusing just on the murders themselves, Zodiac pays more attention to the personal lives and feelings of those trying to find the answer to one of the most important murder investigations in US History. Robert, who remarries within the years of the investigation, finds his second marriage troubled after his wife fears for their family safety after his public pursuit of the Zodiac, Paul loses himself in drugs and alcohol (a trend he was already starting on earlier), while David is demoted after a possible scandal within the SFPD and his investigation. Even during these troubles Robert is the only one who continues the search in an all consuming quest to find the answer that has now become a haunting obsession.The Zodiac to this day remains a mystery even though one suspect, a former teacher named Arthur Leigh Allen (John Carroll Lynch), becomes particularly important subject for Robert and David. Arthur, both in reality and in the movie, was cleared by the police from any link to the murders but is Robert and Paul's belief, and thus the movies conclusion, that Arthur was indeed the Zodiac.What is the price of obsession and what price is worth losing everything that you value? Zodiac asks these questions and, much as it does by not telling who the real killer was, doesn't give a direct answer.",Zodiac
333,nixskits,David Fincher's best is challenging and not for everybody,10,23 November 2009,"""Zodiac"" is a perfect match of visionary director and hard to condense material. James Vanderbilt did an admirable job of taking a larger than one life story and somehow adapted all these people and events (chronicled in Robert Graysmith's two thorough books on the subject) into a script that works. He should have received an Oscar nomination, along with Fincher, supporting actor Mark Ruffalo (portraying Inspector Dave Toschi) and of course, ""Zodiac"" itself for best picture. But the silly academy doesn't reward films like this often and I'll bet less than 20% of them even saw it! As author James Ellroy says on a commentary track, this film is respectful of the victims. The intensity of a murder investigation has rarely been recreated more impressively than here. To compare modern (21st century) technology with what these folks had to work with in the late 60's/70's is to realize ""Zodiac"", whoever he was, had to be one of the dumb luckiest criminals of all time. His ideas were not original to put it politely and the fact he probably was a child molester really makes him a predator that treated society in general like a little innocent he abused for his own perverse reasons.

334,lucyrf,My kind of movie,9,29 November 2020,"I thought they didn't make them any more. Compelling story, LOTS of forensic detail, loads of atmosphere, great performances.Standout points: complete lack of women among the police or the newspaper staff - apart from the editor's secretary. An investigation into a serial killer ""run"" by different local police squads who can't tread on each other's toes or share information. Taking two days to send a picture of a suspect because the Vallejo squad doesn't have a ""telefax"" yet. Golfball typewriters. Telephones. Downmarket but adequate restaurants with formica tables (probably all now over-priced coffee shops furnished with old school chairs and kitchen tables). Fingerprints and handwriting treated as science, when they've been shown up as having more in common with tealeaf reading.I found the first third of the film hard to follow as it was filmed in documentary style, with actors speaking very fast, in the middle distance, and often turned away from the camera. Robert Downey Jr wore a muffling moustache and beard and spoke without moving his lips. Jake Gyllenhaal (who aged from nerd to haunted man) at least speaks clearly.

I guess that was the problem because once you know what happened the movie doesn't really add anything to make it suspenseful. And I guess I'm not really a fan of Fincher either. I don't like the way he uses that color enhancing effect in his movies. Must everything be greenish or brownish? I know that sounds like a lazy comment but it just gets aggravating after a while.The actors all do a fine job. The story is true so what can I say about that? The choice of two of my favorite songs from the era, ""Hurdy Gurdy Man"" and ""Bernadette"" made me a little happy, but the way the former was used was weird which I supposed was meant to be ironic. It really reads like I'm complaining but I guess I was just expecting something spectacular after reading all the reviews and it's just a good movie. As far as movies about serial killers go, I may be a bad judge because my favorite is Summer of Sam which is hardly about David Berkowitz.

342,moimoichan6,In Cold Blood.,8,17 June 2007,"Five years have gone since ""Panic Room"", and the least I can say is that I was a little worry about Fincher's ability to overcome what might be the most representative and brilliant movie of the end of the last millennium : ""Fight Club"". All the fears and doubts of an entire generation were sum up in this movie, roll up in a brilliant and provocative package, that barely hide the sadness and depression tone of the movie. It was the apogee of Fincher's thematic since ""Alien3"", with its characters so obsessed by what they fight, that they lost their identity and become the evil they stand against. The impossibility of living after that and the suicidal part of the characters was link to a certain form of teenage angst, that leads to the impossibility to live in a real world. ""Zodiac"" stands now like the adult pendant of ""Fight Club"", where the anger and revolted spirit of the movie leaves to a mature reflection on evil, obsession and media. And it's most impressive.It all starts with a murder. Others will fallow, but the first one gives the tone : everything is true, all the details stick to the reality, but something always seems unreal. We're in California, in the late 60, were a serial killer called the Zodiac will terrorized San Franscisco for years, and drove some character at the edge of madness, trying to find him. The movie focuses on three of this character : Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal), a cartoonist who's book is adapted by Fincher, the inspector in charge of the case (Mark Ruffalo) and a crazy journalist (Robert Dowley Jr., of course). The movie details their quest in vain, focusing on their strange obsession for the case. The fact that it's a fictive reconstitution of a book that tells real events give that surrealistic (in the proper meaning of the word : over-realistic) tone to this movie. The events are all real and true, but we only watch them through minds so obsessed by their goal, that the reality and objectivity of their vision sometimes disappears. ""Fight Club"" was the prototype of the modern subjective movie, and despite all the realism of ""Zodiac"", the latest Fincher fallow its path. The greatest scenes of the movie are when Graysmith slowly falls into paranoia, thinking the killer is everywhere, and even try to force another character to say a name that sticks to his theories. Reality slowly disappears when it becomes to hard for a mind to understand it all.To those personal quests, Fincher adds a more general point of view about our modern society and its relationship to the media. And that's also one of the great achievement of the movie to use a well known serial killer like a metaphor of all the fear of a time. And if fear is mind created by the ones that try to fight it, the role of the media is in the movie very similar : it's only because the news creates the killer by giving him a visibility that he exists. That's two aspects the movie brilliantly develops : the personal fears and the collective madness that the newspapers and the quest both nourishes. All if this thematic is really strong in other Fincher's movie, it also reminds me, thanks to the use of fiction to recreate a mind reality, Capote's ""In Cold Blood"", witch whom ""Zodiac"" shares the same precision, exactitude, sharpness, but also strangeness in its weird relation to reality.",Zodiac

I expected an ordinary thriller with a lot of killings and many twists and turns, but this one is a lot different, which is something to be expected from a brilliant director like David Fincher. This movie is a piece of real life; it shows that not all cops are geniuses, not all criminals are stupid psycho maniacs, not all what the lead characters think are true, not all crimes are solvable... simply, nothing's certain! I like also how Fincher presented a based-on-true-story thriller without maiming facts and adding the well-known ""comicy"" style of nowadays thrillers. Everything in that movie seems morbidly true. Despite that, it's not boring at all; the take-it-easy gripping style of Fincher will keep you tied up to your chair throughout the almost-three-hour picture, leave alone watching Gyllenhaal, Ruffalo and Downey Together.",Zodiac
344,TheCasualReviewer,The only Zodiac I pay attention to,9,16 September 2020,"SYNOPSIS:
Based on the true story of the infamous ""Zodiac"" killer, Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a cartoonist for a San Francisco newspaper who gets obsessed with finding out who the Zodiac is.REVIEW:
If you don't know who the ""Zodiac"" is, he is an infamous serial killer who killed multiple people in and around the San Francisco area from 1968-1974. He's most famous for sending the police and the newspaper letters bragging about how many people he's killed and never having been caught.This film is absolutely fascinating. It might possibly be my favorite suspense film of all time, true story or not. You have one of the top directors in David Fincher pulls through again with his dark and tension-filled style that truly gives an eerie aura to a story. As far as I know this story is almost 100% accurate in accordance to anyone who was involved around the time. That makes this all the more interesting to watch. If it wasn't already amazing to see Jake Gyllenhaal play a cartoonist heavily invested into a serial killer case, Robert Downey Jr. as an arrogant and alcoholic reporter, Mark Ruffalo as an always annoyed detective and John Carroll Lynch casted perfectly as the creepy lead suspect. The acting in this is stellar and the writing is damn near perfect with every line. As a viewer, this film sucks you in with Robert and his investigation to find out who the Zodiac is. Then the way this film ends is possibly the most subtly perfect endings there have ever been in a film. You get closure. Even when we don't know who committed these murders the evidence is quite damning and so it ends in a way that I imagine didn't actually happen, but didn't completely flip the essence of what actually took place.If you are a fan of suspense, thriller or any sort of interesting true stories around crime I recommend you go see this film right now! When I post this it's currently on Netflix and has been in the most popular category for quite some time. 9.8/10.",Zodiac
345,xavrush89,A mixed bag of good and tedious scenes.,6,27 July 2007,"If they wanted to give moviegoers a sense of how painstaking and tedious soving a serial killer case can be, they succeeded. I really felt for the detectives (and civilians) wanting so badly to catch the murderer. But as an audience member, I had to sit through a lot of banter back and forth involving methodology, code-cracking, and leg work.Maybe that is why films based entirely on fiction are more thrilling, they don't have to go out of their way to do justice to the lives of real living people who worked so hard. I can understand them wanting to show these men's lives outside of the work, but this made for a very long viewing experience without enough suspense or fleshed-out drama to make it top notch.One thing for which I must praise Fincher is that he kept the violence to a minimum, as this movie was more about the investigation than the crimes themselves, and rightfully so--hence the higher grade than I might normally give.

So how is Zodiac different from all of these. For starters, this movie is based on real facts taken from real Police Case files. A killer named as Zodiac was rampant in California during the late 60's. Secondly, such thrillers are usually fast-paced and keep the viewer on their heels (Example - Se7en, Red Dragon, Silence of the Lambs etc).But Zodiac is laid-back, slow and takes it's time. It is a movie which grows on you. Thriller Fans may even get bored and watch it in two sittings (Or even more) Story revolves around three people, A drunkard reporter who has talent but has lost his aim due to excessive drinking (Robert Downey Jr), A cartoonist who is extremely hard working and focused (Jake Gyllenhaal) and a SFPD Detective who is very determined and does not give up easily (Mark Ruffalo). All these three people use their different techniques to get hold of the Zodiac killer .Are they successful in their conquest is what the movie is all about.I am a fan of David Fincher and I like his style very much. He has tried his best to create a good movie with limited information and ensuring that facts are not altered. It is because of him that Zodiac still manages to impress after 2 and a half hours. Jake Gyllenhall had nothing special to do than run here and there and give his 2-3 expressions of surprise, fear and excitement. Ruffalo was good. But Robert Downey Jr was impressive in his short but important role. I want to see more of him for sure. Overall, Watch it on a Sunday Afternoon with lots of time in hand and nothing to do, but watch it for sure.Rating - 7/10",Zodiac
347,tenthousandtattoos,"Effective, creepy, and tantalising...",8,3 December 2007,"""...it's then when the Hurdy-Gurdy Man comes singin songs of love...""Two teenagers shot in a car at an isolated ""lover's lane"", Southern California, 1969. No witnesses. No motives. No suspects.So begins Robert Graysmith's account of the infamous unsolved Zodiac case that gripped America in the late 60's, early 70's, and indeed still fascinates many today. I count myself among those ""many"". And so begins David Fincher's remarkable adaptation of Graysmith's titular novel. The film will haunt you long after the end credits have rolled off the screen and the room fades to black.Immersive, atmospheric, and documentary-real, Zodiac is an achievement and a half for Fincher. Although the point can be argued, I believe this is his masterpiece. The first viewing blew me away. It's amazing how well you, as an audience member, are suffused into this world. You can almost reach out and touch things on screen, it feels that real.Fincher and his various casting directors have an uncanny knack for picking the perfect people for certain roles, and in Zodiac this talent is on fine display. The three leads are amazing, Mark Ruffalo as the bull-dog Detective Dave Toschi, Jake Gyllenhaal as the nerdy cartoonist turned amateur-sleuth Robert Graysmith, and Robert Downey Jr as the hard-drinking, cynical crime reporter Paul Avery.The film dives straight in - beginning with the second ""official"" Zodiac attack on Darlene Ferrin and Michael Mageau (the one just before the first infamous ""Zodiac letter"" claiming credit for it) which left Darlene dead but miraculously Michael survived several gunshots wounds, though strangely was never shown any suspect photos until years after the investigation was deemed ""unsolved"", and relegated to the ""cold case"" files. In a scene fraught with tension and mystery, we watch the doomed teenagers park their car, we wonder does she really know the guy in that other car? We plead silently with them as the car seems to speed away, but then with a screech of tyres starts back toward them... ""Start the car and just go! Get out of there, now!"" But of course, it plays out just like the frighteningly matter-of-fact police report: ""the suspect exited his vehicle, walked to the passenger side window of the parked car, and without a word, began firing..."" The case captures Graysmith's attention immediately, however it's not until another murder on Dave Toschi's beat (cabbie Paul Stine) that the dogged detective and his partner, played by Anthony Edwards, get involved.The film plays out much to the tune of Graysmith's novel of the same name, ie it leaves out a LOT of stuff about the case, and focuses very closely on prime suspect Arthur Leigh Allen, a man both contemporary and modern criminal investigators and profilers, not to mention DNA evidence, seem to rule out as the real killer.However, that's not to say they're not wrong. Who knows? The real Allen died shortly before the cops could speak with him after he was identified by Magaeu as ""the man who shot me"", so I guess we really will never know.That's the dividing line of this film, I think. Fincher has done a marvellous job of capturing the immense frustration people felt (especially the investigating cops) when, time and again, the Zodiac evaded capture after brazen and brutal crimes, not to mention the taunting and insulting letters he constantly bombarded the police and media with. Nowhere is this more painfully rendered than in the scene where Dave Toschi sits in his car at the intersection where Paul Stine was murdered YEARS earlier, just waiting there. We get the feeling he does it a lot, just sits in his car there, and waits, and hopes with that steady sinking feeling growing in his stomach. He sighs, starts the car, and drives away, but we know he'll be back.So you'll either relish that feeling of frustration, or you'll hate the movie for it. Personally, I enjoyed it very much, and was very inspired to go and find out more about the case. I challenge you not to want to know more, as the film opens a few doors it never quite closes, and I was excited to ""fill in the blanks"" so to speak, by delving into a bit of amateur-sleuthing of my own.Like the infamous British Jack the Ripper case, this is a whodunit with endless avenues to pursue, and literally hundreds of theories as to who committed the murders, and why. Some are laughable, though most are really interesting and some are quite plausible.I've watched this film 3 times now, and each time I've noticed subtle things I missed on previous viewings. Very watchable, though slow paced and does require a level of concentration.Highly recommended. The ""thinking person's"" thriller. Enjoy.Footnote: One reviewer commented that it was ""distasteful"" of the film to try and pin the crimes on a dead man (ie Arthur Leigh Allen). Um...come again? It should be remembered the ""dead man"" in question was a convicted child molester. Regardless of whether he was also the Zodiac, IMO he deserves no sympathy, even in death.",Zodiac
348,nqure,Memories of Murder - Squirrels in the Fridge,7,22 May 2007,"Brave attempt - great opening sequence - to depict the fruitless search for an apparent serial killer, detailing the frustration and loose ends faced by the policemen leading the case and the two very different men, from a city newspaper who also pursue the case; a dogged cartoonist who nobody takes seriously at first, the other a maverick journalist whose originality takes him tantalizingly close to finding the killer before he succumbs to alcoholism.Relentlessly downbeat, I think the film does suffer occasionally from too much story in the sense so that you feel detached from the drama of the investigation with information given rather than revealed as part of the journey. The final act does inject more urgency as Graysmith (Gyllenhaal) assumes the search.The film shows that murder investigations are often hampered by simple errors, not by an evil warped genius (Hannibal Lector). For instance, the police interrogate the main suspect but this possibly allowed him time to dispose of any incriminating evidence before a search of his home - as Toschi & Graysmith later surmise.It also deserves plaudits for how the story changes the focus from one main character to another, from Toschi (Ruffalo) in the second Act to Graysmith's pursuit of the truth in the final Act.It also captures a particular period well as well as highlighting how the case did not benefit from police bureaucracy (each police dept possesses evidence that it's reluctant to pass on to the other). With technical developments such as use of computer databases as well as scientific ones such as DNA, modern policemen are better equipped to solve such bizarre, challenging cases as the Zodiac.It would certainly reward a second viewing but it's interesting how Fincher has been regarded as making a 'serial killer' film very much against type (sensationalist 'Silence of the Lambs') and I can't help thinking he was influenced by 'Memories of Murder' a terrific Korean film based on another unsolved true-life series of murders but which is a much more dramatic film, varying in tone from the black to the depressing as well as about two different approaches to solving crime.",Zodiac

350,Dandy_Desmond,Masterful film making,10,4 September 2010,"David Fincher's Zodiac will perhaps not be remembered as his best work. It certainly is not his showboat piece as that is Fight Club. its not his most shocking film which is probably Seven. In the hands of a less than superior film maker Zodiac could have been an exploitation film. Fincher does not dwell on the murders, sure they need to be seen as part of telling the story but he does not use this as an excuse to feed the gore hounds. Instead he chooses to focus on three people who lost something to the Zodiac other than their lives. Robert Downey Jr plays Paul Avery, a newspaper reporter who was threatened by Zodiac. Paul, who may have been heading down this path anyway, became lost in drink and drugs. Jake Gyllenhaal plays Robert Graysmith, a cartoonist for the SF Chronicle, who becomes obsessed with solving the case and eventually alienates his family. The most powerful performance comes from Mark Ruffalo as Dave Toschi. Subtle and measured he is outstanding in the role. Toschi was a legendary cop who Bullit was based on -but didn't solve this case. The real star is David Fincher who puts together a complicated story, makes it understandable and keeps your interest for quite a long film. Also the scene by the Lake is one of the most disturbing I have ever seen. I watch lots of horror films but this scene I find difficult to watch, maybe because it was based on a real poor girl but also as it is directed in such a way to stay with you. Zodiac at heart is a sober character study. There is no deviation away from telling the story just to appease a target audience. Fincher made this movie to tell the story of Zodiac and the people involved. It does its best to solve the murders but as in real life there is no closure. Some may find this unsatisfactory but thats how it is. Zodiac is not Finchers most remembered film, but for me it remains his best to date.",Zodiac
351,garyvanhorn,"A very well done ""true crime"" movie that gets most of the facts straight for once.",8,10 January 2011,"Zodiac (2007) should not be confused with The Zodiac (2005), one is a good movie the other is in the IMDb bottom 100 list. Zodiac chronicles the 22 year investigation into the Zodiac killings. The story begins in 1969 with the shooting of two teenagers in Vallejo, California, one survives and becomes the only witness to ever see the killer's face. What follows is a cryptic trail of bodies, letters, phone calls, and other clues left by the killer to taunt police even as Zodiac continued to kill. The movie does an excellent job of following the investigation as players come and go, leads are uncovered and investigated then dismissed, files closed and reopened, in short the entire 22 year history of the case is condensed into a little over 2 1/2 hours.The movie is engrossing and I was constantly waiting for the next clue, the next lead, the next anything, to lead the investigators to the killer. Players come and go, as is only natural over a 22 year period, some come back to be important, others simply fade away, their parts played in the endless drama surrounding the case. You never know if a lead is solid and the clues valid, the suspects all seem guilty, yet none seem to be taken into custody. Zodiac highlights the immense difficulty involved in police work. There is no ""smoking gun"", no big break in the case, no star witness, just the sporadic pursuit of justice which ends in a decidedly non-Hollywood fashion.Zodiac is slow but relentless it just keeps coming at you, drawing you deeper and deeper into the story. All told this movie is a fascinating look into one of the most mysterious and long-running serial killers in U.S. history.",Zodiac
352,cleary-joshua,"A stylish, well acted and particularly grisly thriller...",8,28 January 2015,"There are two crucial details which set ""Zodiac"" apart from any other serial-killer film (like Fincher's own ""Se7en"", for example) – it's based on a true story, and that true story still doesn't have an ending. To this day, much like Jack the Ripper, the identity of the ""Zodiac"" killer still hasn't been confirmed, which leaves an interesting dilemma for any filmmaker attempting to adapt the story. Do you leave the film without a resolution, or sway against the truth and invent an ending? Neither of those two options is perfect, but thankfully the process of the film is thrilling enough that a complete conclusion is never particularly necessary. It's a stylish, well acted and particularly grisly thriller which skilfully tackles ideas about obsession and the need for an answer despite never actually getting one itself.Starring Jake Gyllenhaal as a cartoonist who becomes fascinated by the murders, the film follows his attempts to solve the case with the help of a journalist at his newspaper, played by Robert Downey Jr, and local detective, played by Mark Ruffalo. The case gets increasingly complex as more murders (which are shown in extremely graphic detail) take place and the unknown murderer continues to taunt the police through his cryptic letters. At its very best, it is an exercise in creating tension in its audience, especially when the Zodiac killer is on the phone live on TV, or when Gyllenhaal's character is searching a suspect's house.At its infrequent worst, however, the film drags as a result of its methods – while the first half of the film is relatively close together in time, it begins to jump later and ends up spanning nearly 20 years. There are slow passages where little new information is learned, and you long for either another murder scene or something crucial to happen. Thankfully it is held up most of the time by brilliant performances from all three leads (Downey Jr is probably at his least annoying here), who work together very well and convey the constant mystery of their situation very well. Gyllenhaal deserves particular praise for his excellent portrayal of an obsessive, who cannot stop until the case is closed.If anything, this feels like a classic Fincher film, with its moody cinematography and 'keeps you guessing' plot-line. The music adds both suspense and a large amount of nostalgia through its referencing of period classics, and the film's desire to transport you back entirely to the 70s is very commendable. It's an entertaining if sometimes slow-going thriller, and certain to give you your own theories about this ongoing real-life murder case.",Zodiac

354,kaaber-2,Wonderfully semi-documentary HEAVY SPOILER ALERT,7,15 October 2007,"When, somewhere in mid-movie, Inspector Armstrong announces to long-time partner Toschi that he plans to leave Homicide and devote his time to Fraud and Family WITHOUT getting gunned down on the proverbial verge of near-retirement or having Toschi running out of the car in slow motion, yelling ""NO-O-O-O!"" (one cliché I find it still harder to brook) it suddenly dawned on me how far this movie is from one of the great disappointments of last year, ""Black Dahlia"", with its ""you'll-never-guess-this"" absurdities and its nonsense solution of plot. ""Zodiac"" does not contain any surprises (apart from the fact that it doesn't have any surprises, which seems to have taken a lot of film-goers by surprise, regardless of the fact that it's about one of the great UNsolved cases in the 20th century); actually, it leans heavily on the documentary genre. Personally, I love mystery movies, I love detective stories, I'm a sucker for Poirot, Miss Marple, Chief Inspector Tennyson and even Morse, but I sort of like reality too, and ""Zodiac"" serves it in spades. What a relief, in a strange way, not to be told whodunit, but only who the respective detective characters in the movie think dunit, and leave it at that. The hapless trio of Toschi (Ruffalo), Graysmith (Gyllenhaal) and Avery (Downey Jr.) would be worth watching in this movie, even without the murders. The acting is great.",Zodiac

More like Zzzzzzodiac,5,28 September 2007,"I honestly don't understand film critics at all.Films they tend to rave about generally leave me cold and a few films they have rubbished have been OK,at least to my tastes.When this film was released the critics were universal in their praise.'Brilliant','tense','gripping','superbly acted throughout'.These are just some of the phrases I remember being said about 'Zodiac'.I wonder why I found it so boring then?Firstly,it moved at a snails pace and how it can be described as gripping is beyond me.It is also way too long by at least 20 minutes.The acting?Pretty good really especially from Robert Downey Jr.The rest of the cast are alright although Chloe Sevigny looked half asleep and Anthony Edwards was fair but no better than that.He looked a bit lost at times to me.I just wanted the movie to get going and it just didn't seem to go anywhere.It is not a patch on David Fincher's other works,especially the excellent 'Seven'.This film was a major disappointment to me and I'm just glad that I didn't go to the cinema to watch it.I really don't think I would have lasted till the end credits.",Zodiac
356,adeckofcards,A police account,10,23 June 2020,"As a time-honored director and with a significant number of good films behind him, David Fincher ventures once again into treating an assassin, this time the Zodiac in a film of the same name.
It is inevitable to resort to comparison with another similar work on his part, 'Seven'. The difference is evident, the first being an almost horror film, while 'Zodiac' focuses on the police thriller.
It is outstanding how David Fincher manages to create an atmosphere throughout the film. An atmosphere of uncertainty and above all constant tension. It is a merit how he manages to maintain tension and suspense for such a long time or how sequences in full light can be disturbing. Fincher achieves this through the dialogues, which are absolutely well thought out to develop the narrative of the film.
In retrospect it could be said that 'Zodiac' is one of David Fincher's best works because of the way he treats a murderer in a different way than usual, with a slow narrative and dialogues that only cause a feeling of increasing tension during the more than two hours of film.",Zodiac
357,bgsmall,Fascinating (albeit dramatisation) real life investigation into a Serial Killer,8,12 December 2020,"I had previously watched this some years ago, but added to my Netflix watchlist as I thought it was worth watching again.Zodiac was a serial killer, active sometime between 1969 and the early 1970's within Southern California. His identity as the movie portrays was unknown to the SFPD many years after the murders attributed to him stopped. However, the movie (IMHO) comes down in favour of one of the particular suspects, in its conclusion.Both Jake Glyenhall and Mark Ruffalo's characters are gripped by the case and indeed do the bulk of the investigative work. What I particularly like about the film, is what I presume is it's 'true to life' portrayal of a complex investigation, where certainty is in short supply, but tenuous evidence is not. The murders are particularly gory, and not for the feint hearted. The real investigation is still open, and as was reported today, investigators have deciphered a letter Zodiac wrote in a complex cipher over 50 years ago. Still fascinating now.",Zodiac
358,Jackblyth8,The Film that had no Ending,8,8 February 2021,"The mystery that still hasn't been answered today is created on screen terrifically. Emulating the dark and creepy side to the masked killer and the uproar it caused amongst the people of America. Jake Gyllenhaal stars as relentless cartoonist Robert Graysmith who dedicates the best part of 20 years to the ongoing case. Robert Downey Jr features as a relaxed and jokey reporter sharing screen time with Mark Ruffalo's excellent performance as a frustrated inspector. Presenting the difficulty of the case, the film jumps forward weeks and sometimes years to emphasise the exasperating case. Beginning on July 4 1969, Darlene Ferrin and Mike Mageau are situated in Vallejo, California before both are brutally shot multiple times by a man hiding his face. Mike Survives. One month later the San Francisco Chronicle receive a letter from a mysterious man self-proclaimed the 'Zodiac' who threatens that unless his letter containing his identity is published, he will go on a mass killing spree. Political cartoonist Robert Graysmith, intrigued by the enigma correctly guesses that his real identity isn't in the letter despite being ridiculed by reporter Paul Avery and other editors, and consequently excluded from details involving the killings. When the cryptogram is published a married couple decipher it, translating an unnerving message. In September, the Zodiac kills law student Bryan Hartnell and Cecelia Shepard by tying them up and stabbing them repeatedly by Lake Berryessa in Napa County. At a bar Avery again mocks Graysmith for his eagerness towards the case, then, Robert interprets the coded letter from the Zodiac stating ""man is the most dangerous animal of them all"" a direct reference to the film 'The Most Dangerous Game' featuring the villainous Count Zaroff who hunts human prey. Two weeks on, San Francisco taxi driver Paul Stone is shot and killed. As a statement of intent, Zodiac mails pieces of Stine's bloodstained shirt and a taunting letter to the Chronicle. San Francisco Police inspector's Dave Toschi and Bill Armstrong are assigned to the case by their Captain, working closely with Jack Mulanax and Captain Ken Narlow in Napa. On a live television show hosted by Jim Dunbar, lawyer Melvin Belli receives a phone call by a man appearing to be the Zodiac - it is later concluded that it wasn't to be. In 1971, Toschi, Armstrong and Mulanax question Arthur Leigh Allen, who is a suspect in the Vallejo case, and spot that he wears a watch containing a Zodiac logo - the same used by the killer. A handwriting expert reveals he didn't write the letter, despite Allen is said to be ambidextrous. Avery receives a letter directly threatening his life - causing him to turn to alcohol and drugs. The reporter shares his news with Toschi and Armstrong. With weight mounting on Toschi's shoulders, we see him irritated and annoyed, exemplified through his inability to sit through a Hollywood movie loosely based on Zodiac. 1978, Avery moves to Sacramento Bee where Graysmith visits him to discuss the Zodiac. Bitterly, Robert Downey Jr's character forces Robert away, envious of his impressive knowledge. The cartoonist then contacts Toschi about the case and excites the at-first reluctant inspector with his insight. Although Toschi can't give Graysmith direct evidence, he does hint to links of the Zodiac's killings. Bill Armstrong transfers from the San Francisco homicide division and Toschi is demoted for forging a Zodiac message. Robert continues his own investigation that is profiled in the Chronicle and leads to the introverted individual being interviewed over the book he is writing about the Zodiac case and how the murders are linked. Playing a pivotal role in the instance, he receives calls of heavy breathing, in which he hangs up immediately. As his obsession deepens, Graysmith loses his job, his wife leaves him and takes his two children. Fixated, the protagonist learns that Allen lived close to Ferrin and and probably knew her and that his birthday matches the Zodiac's that he told to one of Belli's maids over the phone. Despite circumstantial evidence indicating Allen's guilt, fingerprints and handwriting samples don't implicate him. In 1983, Graysmith tracks Allen to a Vallejo Ace Store where he is employed. They engage in a stare together before Robert leaves. 8 years later, the Zodiac book is a bestseller. In an empty room, Mike Mageau, the only Zodiac victim who is still alive and seen the killer's face, identifies Allen from a mugshot as the attempted killer. Final text indicates Allen died before he could be questioned and the case still remains open today. Regarded as the movie that never ended. Jake Gyllenhaal masters the role of a man so dedicated on something, that he forgets what is important in life, showing that the Zodiac had the ability to literally kill lives, but also metaphorically. The dark and intense visual explains the incredibly frustrating mystery, that may never be solved.",Zodiac

For instance, that scene with the young mother. Robert Downey Jr's character going to meet an anonymous source. That just real creepy basement scene.Basically, Zodiac is a story of obsession. One which is a searing and singularly haunting examination of twin obsessions: The obsession of the three men, whose lives are built and destroyed by a series of endless clues, and the obsession of one's man's desire to kill.The acting is is just top notch, with Jake Gyllenhaal, Mark Ruffalo (though he is playing another cop) and Robert Downey Jr. (amazing.

361,DesiBaba,Disappointing snoozer.,5,19 July 2009,"The movie is set in 1970s for the most part and chronicles the events surrounding the Zodiac serial-killer in the Bay area. It is an okay movie that appears to be highly over-rated at 8/10 IMDb rating. No way this should be more than 6-6.5 or so. Fincher has had some good ones in the past so I was generous in giving it 5/10 but his last two offerings (this and TCCOBB have been rather ordinary). The movie might be more interesting for people who lived through the ordeal back in the days but for the rest of us it is just an open ended story that might be fictional based on all we know. There might be more than one person doing this stuff as there is no conclusive evidence to identify the Zodiac or to link Zodiac to ALL of the incidents shown in the movie. It presents a view point which may or may not be accurate in comparison with what might have really happened so to me it was a fictional account of what might have been the case (regarding Lee being Zodiac). Police is shown to be rather incompetent and quite bureaucratic when it comes to dealing with jurisdiction. Average citizens are more creative at decoding the cipher or identifying/following up on leads based on the police reports. It is hard to swallow a lot of what was shown as real or likely, more like the writer (Graysmith) exaggerating his own version for whatever reason, seemed disingenuous to me. Movies in this genre generally build up well in the last quarter but that did not happen here.

363,robertconnor,To Catch A Killer,6,6 February 2008,"In the late sixties, California is rocked by a serial killer who apparently embarked on an elaborate process of communication, using codes and cyphers to tease and taunt all those involved in either investigating or reporting the killer's alleged crimes. As time passes, the Zodiac case has a profound impact on a detective, a journalist and a newspaper cartoonist.Based on an allegedly true story, Fincher chooses to offer up a sprawling and episodic 'reconstruction-style' account of the case over a number of years, switching emphasis from one character to the next as all attempts to crack the case and reveal the truth are thwarted again and again. With harrowing depictions of the serial killer's crimes, and a meticulous attention to period detail, 'Zodiac' often reminds of Richard Fleischer's 'The Boston Strangler' (1968), and certainly the obsessive determination of police and journalists alike, and the challenges of investigating a crime across state and county jurisdictions are brilliantly realised.However, at over 158 minutes, Fincher's narrative, and the performances of his lead actors frequently fail to keep the viewer engaged - Ruffalo is a challenging actor to watch, and pairing him with Edwards as the two primary detectives assigned to the case brings this into stark relief. Edwards is a natural and unassuming performer, whilst Ruffalo 'acts' at all times, delivering his lines in the same, soft, mumbling and frequently unintelligible voice he uses in most of his films. This style works brilliantly in, say, Kenneth Lonergan's 'You Can Count On Me' (2000), but here, as so much verbal information being given to the viewer is key, we are often left wondering what was said. The same applies (although to a lesser extent) to Downey Jnr, whose investigative journalist is usually speaking from behind a cigarette clamped between his teeth. All very realistic, given all are playing 'real people', but pointless if the script cannot be heard or understood, especially as every actor seems to be battling against intrusive incidental sound effects such as type-writers, telephones or traffic. Gyllenhaal fares better as the geekish, and apparently not very good newspaper cartoonist who is gradually drawn into the investigation to the point of obsession, while Sevigny is quite captivating in the minor role of Gyllenhaal's girlfriend/wife. In the end, whilst 'Zodiac' is a fascinating and clever exploration of a real crime and its consequences in 60s and 70s America, it's hardly the gripping thriller it was marketed as, and given that we are being asked to follow and digest over two and a half hours of information relating to the investigation, holding the viewer at the mercy of actors who 'method mumble' whilst imparting this information is unforgivable.",Zodiac
364,joanacatbagan,No weak spots.,9,30 March 2019,"As far I can remember, my first viewing of this film was in late 2007 (I was 16) with my dad and older sister (21)- we bought a DVD copy of this along with other couple of movies available at our favorite video store. One movie DVD per person, commanded by my father. Prisoner of Azkaban for me, Chasing Liberty for my sister, and Zodiac was my dad's choice. He is a big Fincher fan since the 90s and Zodiac is where it all started for me and my sister- we later watched other Fincher films, and to my dad's surprised, he never thought his daughters would appreciate Fincher as much as he did. History aside, I really thought of Zodiac that time as one of my favorite ""Killer-Thriller"" movies. It didn't bore me at all, but I was little frustrated at the ending because I wanted more. I wanted the characters to confirm something.Revisiting this film after 12 years at age 28, I had to say that Zodiac is more than just a movie about the several-decade long hunt for the infamous ""Zodiac"". It is actually a very effective thriller (not just ""Killer-Thriller"") because it didn't attempt to compress 5-7 years of story into one in order to keep viewers interested- yes it is dialogue-heavy but it relied heavily on the facts and used all of its 158 minutes to present us a credible story that portrays how stress, tension, frustration and fascination play upon the lives of Robert Graysmith, Paul Avery, and Dave Toschi. In other words, you'll barely breathe while watching this.Zodiac is a well-crafted movie on all fronts- David Fincher directs this film brilliantly showing the killings in a very effective and chilling fashion that even the screenplay makes sure you are fully invested in this investigation. The performances are great from everybody- Mark Ruffalo, Robert Downey Jr., Jake Gyllenhaal.The ""Bob Vaughn"" scene is my favorite- it's literal perfection, a pure insight into the high-wire act Fincher is doing (very astonishing). And unlike 12 years ago, I wasn't frustrated anymore at the ending. It is what is- it didn't (attempt to) dazzle me, but it does please.To conclude, there are no weak spots in this film.

366,cwarne_uk,Fincher's Best Film Yet,8,26 July 2008,"I had my doubts about this one. Robert Graysmith's book is a disjointed mess that focuses in on a suspect who quite clearly was not the Zodiac. Fincher himself is a director whose most praised works have left me cold - Fight Club was a one-trick movie as bad as Haute Tension, the ludicrously named se7en a tacky torture porn piece with big name stars and none of the genuine frisson that proper horror movies give (artistically on a level with Hostel). The only reason I watched this was because I liked his underrated The Game a few years back. I won't delve into the plot, not that it is that important - always a sign of a good film. Fincher has obviously made this with one eye on All The President's Men, a very 70's New Hollywood feel permeates the film. The film is coolly shot on digital cameras which really show there worth here. Performances are generally good and Downey Jr is outstanding, as is the soundtracks use of contemporary music. Fincher's previous films have shown that he knew how to make movies, hopefully he has now cast of the juvenile impulses that spoiled them.",Zodiac
367,MplusA92,Is there any better place to get continuous thrill for almost 160 minutes ?!,8,12 July 2018,"This is a movie about a real serial killer, and it's not like any other serial killer movie, the geniality mainly comes from its multiple plots and its endless questions and suspense.You will be well entertained with the acting, the 60s and 70s scenes with the pale colors of photography which will make you feel its reality, and the great group of actors which did a great acting that was suitable for the atmosphere of the movie.Finally, it's one of the best drama/thriller movie you will ever see, it's about 160 minutes in length so you may want to cancel any important appointments you have before starting it, and you will definitely not feel bored any any second.",Zodiac
368,gufi-04429,not your regular criminal drama but is that a good thing?,6,5 May 2019,"When I saw there's a movie about this killer I was very surprised. I couldn't imagine how there's going to be a film about Zodiac because I knew the police still hasn't caught the killer. But I was not only surprised, I was very intrigued too. I was curious because usually movies like this have an ending where the killer is caught, like a closing where finally everything is revealed. But I knew that here this can't happen for obvious reasons that I already stated. But is the movie good even though the ending is open? Well, it started pretty successful. The murders caught my attention from the begging and then when the investigation began, I was immediately intrigued. But as the movie processed, the Zodiac killer himself faded into the background, and the film started to be a little boring. There were so many facts, so much information but in the end I knew they won't catch anybody. So with time passing, I started to lose interest and I just wanted to everything to end. I think the main problem is that this particular serial killer isn't found and that's why he's not a good material for a movie. Because we, the viewers, get a very good amount of knowledge about Zodiac's investigation but then what? We don't get our conclusion so in the end these three hours were a waste of time.",Zodiac

370,Diablo1616,David Fincher's Excellent Movie,8,19 March 2020,"Zodiac is a brilliant descent into one of the most infamous unsolved murder cases in history. To all the people who've got their brains sunken into their skulls, this is a TRUE story, and as I've said the case is currently unsolved, meaning this is a story where the heroes DON'T get closure, WHICH might be the dumb reason why some people might be so salty why the killer is'int revealed in the end, do your homework kids.Okay, to get that out of the way the movie itself is one the best TRUE murder crime stories ever told. The acting alone is the biggest thing that makes this move shine. The accuracy is an other big one to, if you watch the special features you could tell that David Fincher, who yet again does a great job at directing, wanted to painstakingly recreate the murder scenes as correct as possible. An other great thing about the movie is the pacing which is crazy because of the movie's length, I've seen this movie about 5 times, and it gets better for me each time, in fact Fincher asked the actors to read their lines faster than usual to make the movie not as long as it already is.
For the people who are still not listening and don't want to listen, go watch the pretty terrible ""Awakening the Zodiac"" movie, its shorter and it ""reveals"" the killer in the end.",Zodiac

372,Supachewy,A Killer Good Film,8,3 October 2010,"The crime thriller Zodiac is directed by David Fincher and stars Jake Gyllenhaal, Mark Ruffalo, and Robert Downey Jr. The film takes place in San Francisco in the 70s for the most part.The film starts off with a brutal murder scene of a young married woman and what looks like a teenage boy by a man that we are not able to see. The man then calls in the murder to the police describing how he did it, but the young teenage boy was left alive. Then at the San Francisco Chronicle, and other locations a coded message was sent from the killer stating how if his letter was not published he would kill more people. After some other similar messages the killer starts to identify himself as Zodiac. Robert Graysmith (Gyllenhaal) is a cartoonist at the San Francisco Chronicle and becomes obsessed with the Zodiac and tries to discover the true identity of the Zodiac along with the police.The screenplay for this film by James Vanderbilt is quite intriguing. I love the way it chronicles the events of the Zodiac murders throughout the 70s and also the intensity of the film. At some points it is a violent murder scene at others it is characters telling little jokes to each other. All of the characters seemed very realistic, I cannot even think of any sort of stock character in the film at all. The film is quite long but the writing keeps it interesting the whole way through.David Fincher's direction is great as always. I think the scenes he shines the most in are the murder scenes. He really knows how to build up the suspense to the murder that the audience knows is going to happen. The two best violent scenes are the ones with the couple in the park and the woman and her baby on the highway. Another fantastic scene was when Zodiac calls up Melvin Belli. The heavy breathing and his scream just built up the creepiness of his character to a new level. Fincher gets great performances from all his leads as well for the most part. Compared to his past films I would say this is not as good as Se7en or Fight Club but it is a much smarter film.The acting in this film was good not great. Gyllenhaal was Robert Graysmith and I would have to say he gave the best performance of the film being very likable and yet I understand how he is flawed by his obsession of the Zodiac. It is not as good as many of his past performances like his in Brokeback Mountain or even really Donnie Darko but it was still a fine performance. Mark Ruffalo gives my favorite performance of his to date in this film. Now personally I do not think Ruffalo is the greatest actor in the world but he is always relatable and the average guy which he is also in this film. Robert Downey Jr.'s performance I thought was pretty weak as Paul Avery. It is basically him just spewing witty dialogue for the whole film and I never really care for his character. Maybe you are supposed to dislike his character but I really did not feel anything for him at all. The rest of the supporting cast gave solid performances, especially those involved in violent scenes.Overall I give this film an 8/10. I would recommend it to anyone who likes dark and historical films.",Zodiac

375,Baldrick44,A truly informative and enjoyable film. The best of the year so far.,10,18 May 2007,"David Fincher, better known for the blood fests Se7en as well as Fight Club ( both great movies ) has shown considerable restraint in his newest film Zodiac. Not that this takes away from the drama when the killings do happen; in a way they are more confronting than in the above two movies because of the knowledge that this actually happened. So while Se7en may be about 7 different ways to kill a person, this is about four men attempting to crack an impossible case- a case without precedent.The movie starts with the shooting of the teenagers on Lake Valleho, which then leads to the San Fransico Chronicle. Crime writer Paul Avery ( Robert Downey Jr. ) and cartoonist Robert Graysmith ( Jake Gyllanhall ) become embroiled in the case as they attempt to delve deeper into the crimes. Meanwhile, at the SFPD, Inspectors Toschi and Armstrong ( Mark Ruffolo and Anthony Edwards respectively ) are attempting to wade through a ton of red tape in order to collaborate the pattern of Zodiac's killings, which have occurred in all sorts of jurisdictions. It seems to be a case without answers, as every time a lead comes, there is an expert to tell them to move on. One of the best scenes of the movie is Toschi walking out of a Dirty Harry film as the movie shows a similar letter from the 'Scorpio' killer.Zodiac is a movie that never seems to drag, despite the fact that there is little blood and gore for a Fincher film. What there is, however, is a wonderful true story about how catching a killer is never easy as it seems; no matter what you try to throw at him.",Zodiac
376,editor-299,'Zodiac' a meticulous diary of unsolved murder mysteries,7,28 February 2007,"Between 1966 and 1974, the so-called Zodiac Killer terrified residents of San Francisco (even the villain in the film Dirty Harry was a version of this individual). And while many theories abound as to the killer's identity, so far (like the Black Dahlia, Jack the Ripper and the Jimmy Hoffa case) remains unsolved to this very day. Based on the actual case files of one of the most intriguing unsolved crimes in the nation's history, ""Zodiac"" is a thriller from David Fincher, who cut his teeth on the genre. As a serial killer terrifies the San Francisco Bay Area and taunts police with his ciphers and letters, investigators in four jurisdictions search for the murderer. The case will become an obsession for four men as their lives and careers are built and destroyed by the endless trail of clues.These clues include letters to the ""Los Angeles Times,"" like the following, written in 1974:""Like I have always (sic) said, I am crack proof. If the Blue Meannies are ever going to catch me, they had best get off their fat asses and do something. Because the longer they fiddle and fart around, the more slaves I will collect for my afterlife. I do have to give them credit for stumbling across my Riverside activity, but they are only finding the easy ones. There are a hell of a lot more down there. The reason I'm writing to the Times is this: They don't bury me on the back pages like some of the others.""Film stars Anthony Edwards (""ER"") and Mark Ruffalo (""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,"" ""All the King's Men"") as police inspectors trying to solve the case; while Jake Gyllenhaal (""Jarhead,"" ""Brokeback Mountain"") plays author Robert Graysmith, and Robert Downey, Jr. (""Chaplin,"" ""A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints"") is newspaper reporter Paul Avery, with whom the murderer seems to have a special connection to.At two hours and 40 minutes, one could easily be bored to distraction, but under the direction of Fincher (""Fight Club,"" ""Se7en"") the film moves along at a nice click. Sure, a few minutes here and there could have been shaved a bit, but for those who have followed this case, or know something about California serial killings, the deliberate and meticulous development is well worth it.And while Gyllenhaal is the big name of the cast, actually his role is very much secondary; as Ruffalo and especially Downey, Jr. stand out on all fronts. Be prepared for some shockingly realistic murder scenes, along with painstaking period detail (one of my pet peeves is to see a film that's supposed to take place in 1972 and the clothing and hairstyles are from a later date). ""Zodiac,"" like the recent ""We Are Marshall"" certainly does not cheat in this department.",Zodiac
377,realalexrice,gone on quite a journey with this film,7,8 June 2021,"Different actor for each killing, brilliant stuff.Also Fincher's best use of soundtrack music in my opinion.Correctly, Fincher interjects moments of pure horror, like any of the killings, the phone call with Sam and his scream, Paul receiving a piece of a victim's shirt, Leigh Allen's interview, and obviously the climactic basement scene. Heck, even the final line delivered followed by a fade to black with those gut-punching facts necessary to put the last pieces in place.Graysmith's hunt in the final act is one I cannot praise enough as it is so seamless in the way it ramps up to it's thrilling final seconds.Fincher is one of the best directors for creating moments and I was surprised upon rewatch about the script and it's overall depth and maturity. Of course, he's a director whose made a career off an attention to detail and besides Social Network, this has his greatest attention to it. And in a nice change of pace, he even throws in some handheld camerawork to flavor up his usual bag of tricks consisting of precise and grounded movements.It's truly a terrifying piece of our American history that is surprisingly recent and it still makes for a compelling and extremely fascinating movie, even nearly seven or eight years after I first watched it.",Zodiac
378,dean2900,Well made but lacks suspense,7,10 July 2007,"The movie is well made and has very good acting. I did give the movie 7 out of 10. However, the movie lacks any suspense at all. I felt like this movie could have been much better if they incorporated more suspense and add some fear to the movie.The movie honestly plays out like a Discovery channel documentary as the cartoonist gets more involved with the Zodiac case which leads to him discovering clues and things the cops missed out on during their investigation.The story is semi-interesting but not nearly as good as Fight Club or Seven by the same director.The movie only grossed 35 million at this time and had a budget of 85 million. Other than 2 early scenes, this movie could have easily been PG (not pg-13). It just didn't feel like a movie about a serial killer.

380,salinaqvi,Slightly Too Long,7,13 May 2020,"Zodiac follows the real life killings for which it is named after. The film did a good job of condensing the true crime story into a 3 hour movie as it seeks to answer who the Zodiac actually was, with the leads all giving good performances to back it up especially Jake who portrays his character quite well. However, due to its long runtime, this is a movie that you should only watch if you are interested in the Zodiac Killings as it doesn't really go beyond the case and doesn't do much other than tell the story. If you are interested however in true crime movies, and especially if you are interested by the Zodiac, then you should watch this. If you're not, then this movie might not be for you.",Zodiac
381,treadwaywrites,Movie Is Just Creepy Enough,7,13 January 2009,"An often overlooked movie from the 2007 season is Zodiac. Directed by David Fincher, he directed Se7en, right off the bat we know that we are gonna have the creeps. Fincher had to be careful with this subject matter. He didn't have to finesse the treatment of violence or ratings board but rather the fact that there are so many Zodiac experts and fanatics. There are tons of books and loads of information in the marketplace about the real life 1970s killer in San Francisco. The movie examines a series of murders that started in July 1969 and letters to local newspapers in San Francisco that followed. The letter writer included a separate cryptic cipher to each of the three newspapers and told them to print the letters or he would go on a killing spree. Director David Fincher also focuses on the lives of San Francisco Chronicle crime columnist Paul Avery (Robert Downey Jr.), political cartoonist Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal), and police inspectors David Toschi (Mark Ruffalo) and Bill Armstrong (Anthony Edwards). Based on the book by Robert Graysmith himself, the film focuses primarily on Graysmith, but also involves the others who became too involved for their own good: Avery, Toschi, and even Graysmith himself. I liked Zodiac a lot but I understand why it did not make too many best of the year lists. The film is a little tedious and runs long. Now if you're a Zodiac nut the film may not be long enough and if you're just a peripheral nut, like me, then it's just right.  As for the poster, there are two good versions of maybe the 4 offered. The one with the taxi and the one with the fog covered Golden Gate Bridge are both creepy enough to capture just the right feeling for the film.",Zodiac
382,RyanEberhart,Pretty Damn Good!,9,1 January 2014,"I like crime dramas that make you think and Zodiac certainly does just that. For those readers of this blog Zodiac is based on a real life crime in which a serial killer in California in the late 1960's and early 1970's killed at least 7 people and wounded 2, those were confirmed. Another five victims are suspected of being committed by Zodiac. The reason this is such an interesting story is because of the mystery and that the crime has never been solved.The movie, made in 2007, follows pretty much all of the actual events. Some of the victims were switched around. There is a lot of the story that pertains to the personal lives of the newspapermen and detectives.Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal) catches the amateur detective bug when he sees the first cipher the Zodiac killer sent to The San Francisco Chronicle in 1969. Graysmith was a political cartoonist turned true crime author. Because of the Zodiac case Graysmith changed careers; in the movie it almost became an obsession to the point that it cost him his marriage, or so it seemed.In the movie, Inspector David Toschi (Mark Ruffalo) and Inspector William Armstrong (Anthony Edwards) catch the case of the attack in San Francisco. They consolidate all of the other attacks and pretty much take over the investigations. Eventually Inspector Armstrong leaves the investigation because the investigation has gone cold. Inspector Toschi is eventually removed from the case because he was accused of writing one of the several letters The Zodiac sent to one of the newspapers.One of the prime suspects, Arthur Leigh Allen (John Carroll Lynch), is investigated several times. All the evidence pointed to Allen, especially after Graysmith began his investigation and started piecing everything together. One of the clues was a phone call that Melvin Belli (Brian Cox) received, or rather his housekeeper, the caller, presumably The Zodiac, mentioned it was his birthday. Graysmith figures out that the date The Zodiac called was December 18th, which so happens to be Allen's birthday. However, before Allen could be brought in Allen died of a fatal heart attack.I actually liked this movie. All the actors played their roles pretty well. I give this 9 stars out of 10.",Zodiac

384,hchais,I expected JFK. I got a dramedy.,8,23 April 2007,"This movie was bad and good at the same time. I was expecting a movie like JFK that was a great political mystery/thriller directed by the great Oliver Stone that was based on a true story and was still able to give you thrills. But what I got was a surprisingly funny crime drama directed by the relatively known/unknown David fincher who brought us se7en. One of the greatest mysterious cop thrillers of all time. But none of the thrills that were in that were in this. I got a 3 hour-long dramedy that was based on a true story that could not provide you with any mystery or thrills. There was absolutely no mystery and barely any thrills as a matter of fact. It could not deliver the goods of a thriller because it already happened and people of the San Francisco Bay Area, like me, already know what happened and did not feel any thrills. But it was still good. A little long, but still good. I don't know what the point of it was, but it was still good.",Zodiac
385,hypersonic8999,Good film but unnecessary long,6,2 May 2012,"If you are expecting a good thriller with intensity like Se7en (from same director) then lose the expectations and you will probably enjoy this. This IS a good film, I would just not classify it as a thriller, but rather as a mystery case where people are trying to follow the complex and sometimes misleading clues. The film follows a cartoonist working at a newspaper who has a knack for puzzles and tries to find out who the legendary Zodiac killer is. Most of the killings happen at the beginning, with a couple more occurring in the middle of the film, and indeed there are some ""thriller"" moments, when the protagonist goes off by himself to search for clues in places he thinks the killer might be hiding or was there. However, I did find it unnecessary long. Maybe it was because of my expectations that I was going in to see a completely different film. On a second watching I did enjoy following through the protagonist's logic path and the portrayal of the suspect murderer is excellent. The plot is quite rigid, and you can't find a fault there. The only fault of this film was its length. When you watch something that doesn't really offer that much in sentiments (be it fear, adrenaline, happiness or anything else) you will probably be bored after the first 90 minutes pass. When that happens you stop following the plot and that damages the overall experience, because this film is solely relying on following through the plot and thinking along the protagonist.So evaluating this film: good plot, good characters and portrayal of characters, excellent acting, but unnecessary long which makes me inclined to give it a 6/10. Granted some of the plot would suffer if the length was less, but the damage done to the viewer's attention span is much more of a serious issue for me.My advice: relax and if you enjoy good detective stories and/or follow famous murder cases in history, you will probably enjoy this.",Zodiac
386,IRateFilms,Zodiac Film Review,7,1 March 2007,"People expecting to see another Seven will be disappointed, but that does not mean in any way that David Finchers newest thriller is not a success. Preoccupied with the bureaucracy's and failures of communication Zodiac deals not with the mind of the killer himself, nor the characters pursuing him, but instead focuses on the procedural department of this three decade spanning investigation. Instead of consuming their lives with the serial killer himself, the three main pursuers are engulfed in a battle with paper work and attempted county to county cooperation. What the film deals with is not the nail biting, stomach churning murders that Seven drew upon so well, but the actual procedures the Zodiac took in his killings. Unfortunately it seems Fincher chose to direct this epic crime drama of over two and a half hours without any of his visual style. With the exception of a handful of memorable shots including a shot of a letter inside a mail box being walked through a building until it reaches its receiver, and a brilliantly engaging shot that follows a taxi cab from a helicopter view, Zodiac seems very lackluster especially considering this is coming from the man who brought us the visually stunning Fight Club.Despite this visual setback, Zodiac never feels boring or contrived, and I cannot be sure yet if this was because of my interest in the case itself or due to Fincher's smooth direction. Either way the film must be praised for telling a story with no resolution and never getting lost in its own path. Trying to tell a story like this, of an unsolved murder case, is a perceptive look into the minds of the obsessed. It exemplifies how one man can psychologically blind people from the outside world concentrating all attention on himself. Again, many people looking for the suspense and blood shed they enjoyed in Se7en will be introduced to a new form of torture, which in this case is psychological.Jake Gyllenhaal plays Graysmith, a cartoon artist who becomes obsessed with the Zodiac case during his employment at the San Fransisco Chronicle. Gyllenhaal plays more of a supporting role in this, even though the trailers would like us to think otherwise. Mark Ruffallo, playing a detective out of Vallero county takes most of the screen time with his purposely low key voice, which seems to distract more than sooth as its striving intentions might want us to believe. Zodiac is more of collective cast adding Chloe Sevigny, Graysmith's wife dealing with his obsession and Robert Downey Jr. playing Paul Avery a reporter whose addiction to cocaine and alcohol must be a throwback to the actor himself. Obviously this powerful cast helps keep this film together as it follows its three act structure, making each character more important as one act ends and another begins. The first act deals with the media and their reactions to what appeared as legitimate threats. THe second act pushes into a bout with several detectives all dealing with same problem of miscommunication. And the third act introduces us to Graysmith's ongoing obsession with the unsolved murder mystery.Audiences falling in line for Zodiac expecting another Se7en are likely to be bored and disappointed overall. This movie is low-key and tasteful, avoiding any embellishments, and sticking to the facts of this case. Zodiac is not trying to scare people or even pull them into the world of a serial killer the way Se7en did so well. Instead this is a film about procedural's and communication, which might be a very distracting set of issues for someone to deal with, when going into a supposed thriller.",Zodiac

388,thomasmitilis1995,NOT MANY PEOPLE HAVE BASEMENTS IN CALIFORNIA...,9,30 May 2020,"PROS:
~Jake Gyllenhal gives one of the best performances of his career. He plays an antisocial cartoonist, Robert Greysmith who likes solving puzzles but suddenly is drawn into the detection of the case. He becomes so obsessed with the murders and doesn't realize how harm he causes himself and his family. In his attempt to follow all the clues and find the identity of the killer, he eventually breaks up with his wife (Cloe Sevigny) and is involved in horrific situations (the basement scene is so stressful).
~The rest of the cast is excellent too. Mark Rufallo as detective David Toschi and Robert Downey Jr. as Paul Avery make a respectable job. Both those characters are obsessed as well, something that costs them their career. The first one is accused of something he doesn't do and the second one end ups being alcoholic and miserable. The film points that the fascination and obsession can lead to a dangerous path if you don't know when to stop (like the character of Antony Edwards).
~John Caroll Lynch is fantastic as Zodiac and the emptiness on his face makes him intimidating. His killings are unhesitating and specifically the first murder on the car and the one in the lake keep you on the edge of your seat. In addition, the scene with the woman that is stopped by a stranger is horrifying, especially when there is a baby along with her.
~The mystery of the film is engaging and makes you feel that you are a part of the investigation. In other words, you want to connect the dots like the protagonist and solve the case before any of the characters does. The introduction of various suspects and clues adds to the complexity of the case.
~ The ending leaves you with absolutely no justice and makes you understand that not everything has a happy closure. The film prefers staying close to the actual events rather than giving a typical hollywood ending.
~The movie underlines significant problems of the society. The bureaucracy and the lack of coordination are in fact the reason why this case isn't closed for about 40 years. Another important aspect is the the way the media present social problems that have an effect on the safety of the civilians.
~The direction by David Fincher is masterful once again and the narrative structure and the tight editing help the pacing so you don't feel the lengthy running time of the film.
~The cinematography is beautiful and the depiction of San Fransisco is realistic. The decade of 1960s and 1970s is perfectly illustrated and the cars, the clothing and the haircuts are precise of that era. Moreover, the music score creates a gritty atmosphere.CONS:
~The storyline of Paul Avery could be explored better in the third act. He is actually out of the game very early in the movie although it seems that he will play a bigger role in the end.",Zodiac
389,mrrockey,"A Fascinating, Disturbing Look into the Men Who Lost Their Lives Looking for the Zodiac",8,25 October 2013,"NOTE: this a review of the director's cut, not the theatrical cutZodiac is an interesting film. It's about the infamous real-life, San Francisco serial killer, the Zodiac. The film goes through his murders and investigations in detail from 1969 to 1991. But instead of diverting from fact and making the story more ""cinematic"", they keep it very faithful to what happened in real-life, making this a very plot-driven movie. But does it work? Let's find out!First of all, I'm gonna talk about the storytelling in the film. The film has a LOT of plot as it covers an entire murder investigation from 1969 to 1991 and it goes through very quickly. It starts off quickly with the murder of two teenagers in a car and from then on, it never slows down and it actually works quite well like this. Often, movies are long because of bad, unnecessarily slow pacing but here, it's appropriate because this IS a very long story. However, it does make the film somewhat hard to sit through because of how long it is. By the last 40 minutes or so, you'll be checking your watch and yawning a bit so this film certainly isn't a light, breezy watch.The film also has a dark, chilling atmosphere to it and the cinematography, like all of David Fincher's productions, is very dark and stylized. This was actually pretty surprising for me since this is a true story, I expected them to use as realistic cinematography as possible but instead, they went for a slicker, more stylish direction which is actually quite a positive because to me, realistic cinematography is boring.The film is also very disturbing as it features realistic, brutal murders that isn't the least bit glamorized. The murders here are raw and brutal, not the fun, over-the-top violence you see in a Friday the 13th flick. But not only is the violence disturbing, but also the story. It features these obsessed, workaholic men who do very little beyond trying to find the Zodiac. When you think about it, this film isn't really about the Zodiac. It's about the men looking for the Zodiac. It's about how these men lost their lives looking for something they never found. It's a sad story about how sometimes your job, or interest can become an obsession that will ruin your life. Towards the end of the film, our protagonist, Robert, becomes so obsessed with finding the Zodiac to the point where he starts abandoning his family and getting creepy phone calls from an anonymous caller. It's a very thought- provoking statement about jobs and interests and it's beautifully expressed by Fincher's direction.The cast here is perfect. Jake Gyllenhaal is the everyman in this story. He's a cartoonist who finds the Zodiac letters in his workplace and gradually becomes more and more obsessed with him and we believe it. Mark Ruffalo is a detective who's been assigned to find the Zodiac. He plays it very soft-spoken and polite but throughout the story, we see him get more and more frustrated with the way things are going on and Ruffalo sells all these emotions really well. Robert Downey Jr. is playing... well, Robert Downey, Jr. But you know what, he's GREAT at playing Robert Downey Jr. so no complaints here. Everyone else was great too but these were definitely the ""big boys"".Overall, it's a fascinating, disturbing look into the lives of men who lost their lives looking for a serial killer. 8/10.",Zodiac
390,tvspace,"Disappointing, uneven",5,17 April 2019,"Zodiac was surprisingly poorly done given the pedigree of all involved. This very long movie is pretty horrible until we jump forward in time to the late 70's, when it finally finds its stride and becomes quite engaging. Overall it is paced and edited almost like a comedy -- late cuts into scenes to get a few lines of zippy dialog, then quick cuts out to rush on to the next plot point. It completely doesn't work as a creepy, suspenseful serial killer movie, which requires long slow takes full of dread and anticipation.There basically is very little interest by Fincher is the actual crimes (the original Zodiac killing doesn't even make the cut, as we start halfway through his spree 6 months later). Instead he is focused on a kind of shifting buddy movie (first between Jake Gyllenhaal and Robert Downey Jr. as co-workers at the San Francisco Chronicle, then later between Gyllenhaal and Mark Ruffalo as detective David Toschi). This is a weirdly Hollywood move to me -- let's make the movie about the all-American (if flawed) good guys, not about the killer or the victims or the dread in the city at large.Downey, Jr. is awful -- straight up. It's a scenery-chewing performance you'd expect to find at a community theatre. Anthony Edwards -- as Ruffalo's partner -- is pretty bad too. Brian Cox's portrayal of Melvin Belli is ridiculous and doesn't ring true. There's just a LOT of bad acting in this movie.My sense after watching it, and seeing how immensely the movie improved once it got to the late 70's and turns into a kind of Richard-Dreyfuss-Close-Encounters movie about a man destroying his family life with a weird obsession, is that it should have started in the late 70's then flashed back to the original story in the late 60's as needed (which might have been very little indeed, given all the bad performances in that part of the footage).A small detail but one that somehow captures the weird, unpoetic and uncomfortable relationship this movie has with its own narrative: as we zip around from location to location we are constantly being given subtitles telling us where we are. I.e., ""The Corner of Washington and Cherry"" -- and every time we go back there we get that title again -- as if we can't recognize the location on our own. Well, we CAN'T recognize it, because Fincher failed to associate an iconic image with the intersection that he could cut to at the start of the scene to place us, without using subtitles. The movie is just klutzy throughout in hundreds of little ways like that, distracting you from the story with its graceless style. By the end I felt like it was made by people just clocking in to earn a paycheck.In a way I think the best movie about the VIBE of the Zodiac (without being about him at all) is Phillip Kaufman's very creepy Invasion of the Body Snatchers, released in 1978 and set in the same San Francisco -- it could be seen as a metaphor for the breaking down of the social contract (as most viciously embodied by someone like the Zodiac) in late 70's America.",Zodiac
391,fire-58,Movies like this don't come along very much,10,29 December 2011,"I get tired of movies trying to keep your interest with something that is borderline interesting. THIS MOVIE WAS FREAKIN GREAT Im sitting there on the edge of my seat just driving my self crazy wanting to know what is about to happen. The movie had it all, great acting, great story great plot.I don't like movies that do the whole ""3 years later"" bit, but i have excused it in this case because it was part of the real story and not just an excuse for bad writing. I had heard of the story a lot when i was a kid but never knew that it was what it was, The case is still open to that makes it even better. I was a little worried this movie might suck, i mean look at what they did with the last helter skelter, it was alright i guess but not as good as it should have been.This movie was a total home run out of the park flick!

392,lekgolah,One of Fincher's best!,10,23 October 2010,"Sometimes it's the best films that may slip past you upon their release and for me, Zodiac is a film that falls into that category. The content is dark and unpleasant and the surprising lack of any attention from the Academy or from any other major awards certainly didn't help this films popularity but I urge you know to seek this film out. Based on a true story of the San Francisco murders by the mysterious individual known only as the Zodiac and is directed by David Fincher (Fight Club, The Social Network). The film follows Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal) who is a cartoonist for a newspaper but soon becomes obsessed with helping the police find the person responsible. Some of you will know that the case was never solved but how does this make for a satisfying film I hear you cry. Well that would spoil the film. Today we are so used to seeing crime films where you already have a good idea as to who the culprit is that it often results in becoming clichéd. Here we know as much as the detectives do and by that I mean not a lot. This adds to the suspense when the detectives are speaking to various suspects who may or may not be the killer. The acting, directing, lighting, sound, camera angles and editing is all fantastic and this is all evident in one of the films more disturbing scenes where we witness two murders. Everything about the way it starts to how it ends is tense. We know that there is no one around as a man from behind a tree approaches a couple enjoying a quiet afternoon at the lake and because of this we feel their fear. Supporting cast members include Mark Ruffalo and Robert Downey Jr. who are both brilliant. Each actor plays to their strengths well and are able deliver each line perfectly, which makes it such a shame that the film was not recognised by the Academy when The Curious Case of Benjamin Button was. Both are fantastic films yet it is this film that leaves a lasting impression. For those who like films that are suspenseful then you will find a lot to like here. The dark story will deter some from seeing this film but for anyone interested in the crime genre or are a fan of David Fincher's previous films, this is a film I strongly recommend.",Zodiac
393,benoyum111,Aside Fight Club !,1,10 July 2021,"David Fincher's Fight Club was a very good inspiration when it came out. I really liked that movie and I am thankful to David Fincher about it...But besides Fight Club, all his movies, including Zodiac has some dark tone, some wacko/psycho issue, some greyish nice palette and some good acting... but nothing more!They give no inspiration to me, besides that I learn that there are some maniac people in our society and then there are some people(mostly cops) to stop them (and mostly they are not able to succeed because the maniac out smarts them.)
So???This is why he does movies? To show us that there are serious and clever maniacs that do bad things and that there are people to stop them?Is this the feeling he tries to give us: Stay away from strangers, lock your door, be suspicious!Or maybe he always wanted to be a detective police officer and solve murder cases, but he couldn't, so he is making this kind of movies!?David Fincher could also be a painter, and paint some grotesque greyish paintings with a bit of blood in them. No need for 3 hour long empty movies.Anyhow I am done with David Fincher movies, and will remember him with Fight Club only...",Zodiac

It's early in Savid Finchers career but his brilliance is present throughout. The story is engaging and the cast is just about perfect with fabulous performances from Gyllenhahl and Ruffalo - not to mention the comeback of RDJ post rehab and pre Marvel movie superstardom. The plot peels the layers of the pursuit of the Zodiak serial killer away like an onion. We dive in with them as they follow the clues and leads for more than a decade. Highly recommended.,Zodiac

No amount of reviews will be able to sway your opinions. Over two and a half hours??? What was gained from that, other than making it dreadful to watch in one sitting? Hence, I broke it up into three nights at about 45 minutes a pop. It's really hard for it to hold your interest at all. Here's a helpful hint - watch it with subtitles on. The dialogue is also way too San Francisco local and the names of too many cities, lakes, streets, counties, and buildings are mentioned too fast and too often that it will make your head spin. Some cool fashions and set design to recreate the late 60's and 70's, that about the only merit this film had.

It shuns the temptation to be sensationalistic and sticks pretty much to the known facts. The acting is excellent. On more than one occasion I forgot I was watching actors that I'd seen in other movies. The actors blended into the movie without becoming a distraction to the story. You get it all in this...mystery, intrigue, suspense. Unlike movies like Black Dahlia and Hollywoodland, your time is not wasted on fictional back story that pulls you away from the true events.

402,benm-41751,An enjoyable and well-crafted movie that gets a little mired in the facts,8,31 December 2018,"Zodiac is a suspenseful and entertaining account of one cartoonist-turned-writer's attempt to identify the Zodiac Killer after investigators have given up.The movie clocks in at 2.5 hours, even in the pared-down theatrical release, but it's one of those films that manages to go by in a flash. This is thanks in part to the excellent technical work on the cinematography, sound, and editing - which in my eyes were done perfectly. The early part of the film builds up an incredible suspense plus an investment in the efforts of all the characters to solve the mystery of the Zodiac Killer. This makes for a really entertaining and enjoyable movie. On top of this, the 1970's aesthetic is well done too.Part of what makes the movie so engaging is that it is based on thorough research of the real facts of the Zodiac Killer. But this also contributes to the movie's slight unraveling towards the end. As much as I admire their commitment to portraying the real case, the filmmakers didn't fully capitalize on the incredible suspense and dread they created in the few action scenes. Instead, the movie begins to flash a dizzying array of facts from all kinds of talking heads, to the point that I lost track of what they were talking about. Gyllenhaal's character doesn't really seem like the lead until you slowly realize that the story centers on him and that he takes most of the screen time. While the movie is based on this real-life person's account, it may have been wise to instead balance the story on a few of the characters including the Zodiac Killer himself, who constantly looms over the watcher at the beginning but eventually seems absent in his own film. Movies can take some liberties, otherwise they become documentaries.Those flaws prevent Zodiac from reaching its full potential, but it is nonetheless a great movie worth watching.",Zodiac
403,stairways,Plodding and ponderous with abrupt ending,7,9 October 2020,"The late, great (usually) film critic Roger Ebert got it badly wrong when he said this tale of newspaper man turned detective was without all the cliches usual to the form. In fact the writing is so clearly on the wall from the first few scenes that we don't even need to wait for Jake Gyllenhaal to start his code breaking and sleuthing to know that he'll eventually get his man where three Police forces and half a dozen top journalists fail.Movies like this, based on a true story, need more than a linear adherence to the facts (such as they are) to make them involving and rewarding, on which two counts Zodiac barely limps across the finishing line.In fact the ending is so abrupt and unsatisfactory that you'll think someone switched off your internet connection by accident, possibly when they were reaching for the fast forward button on your remote.Obsessive junior newspaper man comes good and saves the day (but loses his beautiful family in the process)? Check.Brilliant senior investigative reporter drowns in a bottle of JD? Check.Smart sympathetic cop has the desire to finish this, even after more than a decade, but what do you know, his hands are tied? Check.Even if these were once real people, in this movie they're reduced to caricatures.

It wasn't bad or anything but apart from seeing some of the killings and the messages the zodiac sent, it basically a 1,5 hour setup of the premise the way I see it. That's too long. Then, suddenly it goes from 0 to 100. I get a boatload of information all at once in quick succession with characters talking really fast. That's the part where I'm not smart enough.

405,carljessieson,Another Work of Art by Fincher,10,6 September 2010,"I love David Fincher, I really do. I have never been disappointed by a film he made.I only heard a negative review about this movie, so in watching it I was a little skeptical. The bad review basically criticized its length, but I only believe that could be a problem if the viewer is not lending their full attention to the film. Yes, it's long-but yes, it's high quality stuff, so it doesn't matter. It's genuinely interesting. Not only does it show the legitimate processes of detectives in pursuit of a serial killer, but it shows the lives behind the pursuit. It shows the children of, the marriages of the police officers and the reporters. It gives insight to an aspect of crime that you can't find in real life unless you're a police officer or a reporter yourself. The characters, based upon real people, are just that: real. It's refreshing. There was not one actor that I was disappointed in, not one person presenting amateur acting to disrupt the illusion.The plot was interesting, of course, as all films searching for a serial killer are. It was frustrating at the same time, not knowing who it was, but that's characteristic of all films in this genre. Not a complaint, just an observation. It wasn't tiring, it didn't drag on. Although there were frequent disappointments in the story (not in the telling, just the actual happening), but I didn't feel them because Fincher is so good. The way that he told this story was brilliant. This is not a waste of 2+ hours, this is full of information regarding a true and unsolved crime. It's actually educational.Visually, it was beautiful. Fincher got beautiful shots, beautiful angles, beautiful colors, as always. Even if you don't like the actors, the story, the dialogue, you can still like the movie because it's just really nice to look at. Fincher also controls which emotions he wants to evoke, which is great. He's successful in it. If he wants to get you scared, he will. If he wants you to laugh, be disappointed, frustrated, he will. He is excellent.I was very satisfied with this film. It was informative, interesting, disturbing, and the conclusion wasn't awful or anything. It was a good ending, honestly. I want to buy this movie.",Zodiac

So as you may have guessed, I (like some of the police in this film) was pretty clueless as to what to expect.Boy was I happy to watch a film that delivered above and beyond my limited expectations. The pacing is brilliant, the acting is Oscar worthy (particularly from Mark Ruffalo), and the entire movie is a nail biting experience from start to finish. The first half of the film is good but it's as the cops and journalists carry on with their investigation (years) after the killer has stopped murdering folk that the film really gets going. There are some great scenes in the second half of the movie that add real tension and suspense to the picture. This suspense gradually builds and builds until the final reel when the person we and the police suspect is the killer is almost confirmed to be the killer...and this of course amounts to a very satisfactory finale, for us-the viewer, as up to this final point we have been on the edge of our seats guessing Graysmith's (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Inspector Toschi's (Mark Ruffallo) next move.Anyway a great movie and one I would have given 5* had the first half been as good as the second.",Zodiac

I like that Arthur Leigh Allen is shown as likely being the killer which I believe. I have never read Graysmith's book but I knew the theory very well. However, I think this movie fails not with the storytelling, but with who is telling it. Jake Gyllenhaal is fine but nothing special. Downey Jr also gave a surprisingly flat performance. Ruffalo was fine but I'm not sure why his partner was played by Anthony Edwards. John Carol Lynch does a decent job though.

Mark Ruffalo and Anthony Edwards portray the homicide detectives assigned to the case.

But as long as this film had to be that is where some will feel it dragging on - and despite the lengthiness of it all, I never found it boring. One cannot brand this as a standard ""whodunnit"" either because some clues are dropped overtly and blatantly, and when confusion manifests, it becomes a story device to keep you guessing. While some may find this inferior to his perturbing 95 masterpiece SE7EN, it is definitely lighter in tone, and consequently DOES offer much for those who want to have a good time at the movies.It ends with you having to decide, it even includes a rather bland but tension-coated moment where Gyllenhaal comes face to face with the (supposed) killer.

416,andy-933-696608,Zodiac movie review,10,30 December 2010,"Its both provoking in the mystery that has truly plagued America for over 40 years, driving the many brave men who sought to uncover it either to quitting, drinking, or even just enough madness to call it quits. Director David Fincher travels back in time to show audiences the very case of the Zodiac killer. The Zodiac killer ran on a mind wrenching killing spree, sending letters to various Newspapers, including the San Francisco chronicle, Vallejo Times Herald, and the San Francisco Examiner. Each of these letters would be mailed in a enveloped form containing both a letter to the editor to the editor, as well as a cipher encrypted in various forms of codes as messages to further explain his nature as the Zodiac Killer, his intentions, and even his own state of mind. He would kill people on and on, starting with various groups of young lovers, preying on them in the most predatorial of circum stances, leaving patterns of murder at first, thus later shattering them to throw off investigations. The first message, deciphered by the editors, including the chronicles very own Paul Avery (Downey Jr.), intrigued me mainly out of its hidden message, showing the Zodiac's possible motivation for murder. A not very well respected, but kind hearted cartoonist at the Chronicle, Robert Graysmith (Gyllenhaal) deciphers unsolved parts of the code leading him to the film ""The Most Dangerous Game"" which serves as the basis for Zodiacs love to kill man because he considers him to be the most dangerous animal there is to hunt. His general motivation of sport hunting humans as targets serves as enough of a clue of just how crazy he is, but in the very few calls he made with his on voice, he sounded both calm and premeditated in his react ional responses to the moments he had performed the murders, inciting every speculative detail of both the victims, the murder weapons, and the location of the event. The lead cast was very impressive in their performances, Gyllenhall as Graysmith, Downey as Avery, and Ruffalo as Detective Toschi. Each of them brought something unique to their characters, as well as their own contribution to solving the mystery of the Zodiac. As the young boy scout of a cartoonist, Gylleenhaal portrays his character with an unbelievable sense of innocence and determination, that viewers will be surprised at his very drive to find the murderer. Downey brings his usual quirky sense of humor to the drug abusing Paul Avery, using his tone of cynicism to make this tortured soul into an at least amusing character to the investigation. Mark Ruffalo himself as the detective who had the very first absolute clue of the who Zodiac was, plays his role with the very same determination as Graysmith, following more and more leads, using every detail possible to pin the possible evidence to their primary suspect, Arthur Leigh Allen, the man with the highest probability of being the Zodiac. The factors mainly essential to the accusation of Allen as the killer, were the very fact that he could not only write with both hands, but furthermore his own handwriting itself proved to be a perfect match to the mailed Zodiac letters. It was unfortunate that these factors alone did not prove enough to charge him. The only true lead came with his identification in 1991, by Matthew Mague, the Zodiac's first surviving victim. In an the films conclusion we viewers are shown brief but clear messages about the polices stance on the investigation, only to be disappointed at the fact that Allen lucked out through his own demise of a heart attack, before charges could be made. Despite that little inconvenience, the film was excellent, using both very specific details on every factor that revolved around the Zodiac investigation, such as his murders, his messages, the dates of these simultaneous occurrences, and further more the very concluding piece of valid evidence for conviction. The direction of the film and how it just goes at a hourly, weekly, monthly, and yearly forward change of pace, while still having it lead characters all use the significance of their supporting roles to further contribute to another fast forwarded stage of the investigation. The respected Director of ""Seven"" and ""The Game"" has shown viewers his talent as a director capable of exploiting such pure thrill and charismata in both the matter of the film's subject, and even the characters. The film ""Zodiac"", itself leaves it audiences with a sense of curiosity, out of the main fact that the case has been reopen for a few years, since the Zodiac killers murders have left some traces of reoccurrence. Sure anyone can assume that Allen wasn't the Zodiac, or could it mean that his work started a legacy of murder for others to follow. We'll probably never know.",Zodiac

418,piksplanet,Brilliant film-making. CANNOT believe they didn't recognize this at the Oscars!!,10,9 May 2008,"David Fincher, in my opinion is a movie-making genius. He hasn't made, what one would call, a LOT of movies, but each and every one he has made has stood out. I've seen all his full-length features to date. From Se7en to Fight Club. Now, I know many people will disagree with what I'm saying, but, in my opinion, Zodiac is his best. And for more reasons than one, if I made a list of my Top 20 Hollywood movies, Zodiac would be one of them.In the late 1960's through till the late 1970's a notorious serial killer who called himself The Zodiac haunted the San Francisco Bay Area. It is not known exactly how many murders he committed. For the purpose of publicity, he used to mail letters and zodiac codes to famous newspapers in the city giving them information which only he could know, taunting the Police to carry out a mass investigation. Till date, the case remains one of the greatest unsolved crimes of San Francisco. The movie is based on actual case files, and adapted from Robert Graysmith's Zodiac account books.I saw Zodiac on a sultry afternoon, in the dark confines of my room. It is a two hour thirty seven minute movie. It felt no more than ninety minutes. By now, those who have read my takes on movies will know that I hold the background music as, perhaps, the most important factor in getting the viewers into the basic feel of the movie. Zodiac has got a blend of 60's Jazz, Pop and Rock music. Even the closing credits have got music enough to make you remain seated and hear it out. It has a gripping background score. The film starts, and ends, with the same song. The song : Hurdy Gurdy Man. It is stylized, almost scary, along with a nod-ya-head vibe to it.The movie has an ensemble cast. With the likes of Jake Gyllenhaal, Robert Downey Jr., Mark Ruffalo, and Brian Cox, the acting is stellar. Ruffalo's portrayal of Inspector David Toschi is the pick of the lot. Gyllenhaal, playing the role of Robert Graysmith, a cartoonist for the San Francisco Chronicle whose obsession with The Zodiac leads to the most striking amount of evidence in the case, carries on the express that he started with Brokeback Mountain. I have never seen Chloe Sevigny's other avatar, but her coldness shines in every scene we see her. The whole 1960's/70's setting merely adds to the excellent screenplay. The film has a black imagery. The only clear amount of brightness we get is in the first five minutes, coming from a flashlight.The dialogue is gripping. The delivery is perfect. The screenplay, sublime. Everything is just right. The cinematography, the setting, the direction. It just fits right in. There was not a moment during its length that I looked at my watch or thought that it was long. It is edge of the seat stuff. The movie is perfect. I didn't know much about the Zodiac killings till I saw this movie. It interested me enough to spend a day reading whatever I could find on the net. When a movie gets you to do that, it says something. For all that its worth, I cannot find a single reason why this movie was overlooked at the Oscars. If this isn't Oscar material, I'm not sure what is.By the time the movie ended, Zodiac left me stranded with a million random thoughts jumping in my head. It's a thriller of amazing proportions. It just gets you. Whether it is Downey Jr's stylized portrayal of an engaged reporter, shifting to a drunkard who doesn't really give a damn, or the very voice of the Zodiac over the phone. The opening sequence, 5 minutes long, only sets you up for a treat of a movie. This is vintage cinema.Brilliant. Absolutely brilliant. Watch out for the opening sequence. It rocked me to my core. Highly recommended to anyone who loves watching movies. Straight 10!",Zodiac
419,alexart-1,Chilling. Thrilling. Well Done!,10,1 September 2008,"""This is the Zodiac speaking"" says the Zodiac killer (also known as Sam) in a truly chilling scene where he has a conversation with a news reporter. Fincher has definitely done a great job with the film ""Zodiac"".As you can already tell, the film is about the true story of the Zodiac killer. A cartoonist for the San Francisco Chronicle (Jake Gylenhaal) hears about the case and begins to do his own investigation of it along with the help of a writer (Robert Downey Jr.) and an inspector (Mark Ruffalo).Among the highlights of the film are the three murder scenes. The scene that is probably most memorable is the one with the mother and the child. The scene feels so realistic as we see the mother in the road crying and explaining how she threw her baby out of the truck to save him. This goes without saying that the acting is truly fantastic.Zodiac is a film that probably will not be appreciated by some, but when you have the patience to sit through all 158 minutes of it (or even 162 if you have the director's cut), it is a rewarding experience. Fincher and the cast have clearly been snubbed of Oscars for this film.",Zodiac
420,AW_McGOWAN,A True-Crime Story Made For Fincher,8,8 January 2021,"After his masterful work directing the serial killer suspense-drama ""Se7en,"" David Fincher seems like the obvious pick to helm a feature film about the Zodiac killer. According to history, the elusive Zodiac killer committed several murders in the San Francisco Bay Area during the late sixties and early seventies. The killer shrewdly delivered encrypted messages to the local newspapers, providing hints about his motives and sending waves of hysteria up the west coast. Despite investigative journalism, extensive police work, and numerous suspects, no one ever caught the Zodiac and the story remains open ended.As Fincher's film makes note of, the Zodiac case has already inspired several movies before this one, most recognizably 1971's ""Dirty Harry,"" which came out in the thick of the crimes. As morbid as the story is, it feels made for Hollywood, fit with a mysterious antagonist, colorful characters, and bouts of rapid intensity over a slow-burn narrative.If developed today, ""Zodiac"" would likely be outfitted for a comprehensive miniseries. However, back in 2007-before the rise of streaming services-miniseries were not as widely embraced. Therefore, Fincher had to fit the Zodiac's long, complex story into a two hour and thirty-seven minute runtime, and make crucial choices about where to direct his focus.Primarily, Fincher tells the story through the eyes of Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal), a cartoonist for the San Francisco Chronicle who becomes obsessed with finding the Zodiac killer from the moment the paper receives the villain's first coded message. Graysmith does not emerge as the primary protagonist until the third act, though. For the first half of the movie, he stands alongside Chronicle journalist Paul Avery (Robert Downey Jr.) and SFPD inspector David Toschi (Mark Ruffalo) as the main characters.These three stars all deliver wonderful performances. RDJ's charmingly hotheaded Avery almost feels like a prophetic peek into his career-defining role as Tony Stark, which debuted in ""Iron Man"" the following year. Meanwhile, Ruffalo plays an appropriately stressed lawman trying to crack this notorious case, and Gyllenhaal has the perfect balance of innocence and intensity to make Graysmith likable yet ambitious. John Carrol Lynch also does praiseworthy work portraying one of the prime suspects. For an actor who usually gives off suburban-dad energy, Lynch is fittingly discomforting here-it is akin to Robin Williams' type-defying performance as the antagonist in Chris Nolan's ""Insomnia"" five years earlier.For all of these stellar performances, though, it is Fincher's tone and aesthetic that most distinguishes ""Zodiac"" in the true crime genre. The entire movie is bathed in low light and dark blues with the occasional flash of daylight for uncanny effect. One of the most memorable scenes is actually when the Zodiac, donned in a Renaissance-looking black cloak, ambushes two of his victims in the daytime. The contrast is an unconventional kind of eerie that stays with the viewer for a long time.Fincher displays many of the Zodiac's alleged murders in the film, but never with gratuitous violence. In fact, relative to ""Fight Club"" and ""Se7en,"" there's not too much blood on screen. He focuses more on the investigations than the killings and doesn't pretend to know more about the situation than what's featured in the source material: the real-life Graysmith's book, ""Zodiac."" Nevertheless, the director does offer some evidence-based direct glimpses into the titular murder's notorious crimes.Some might deem this subject matter insensitive, for the Zodiac's victims were real people that would probably still be alive today if they weren't murdered. However, given how quickly audiences are to accept movies that fetishize real wars or depict mass destruction, the Zodiac killer falls far from the worst thing cinema has dramatized over the years, and Fincher's retelling of the story strays from anything sadisticLastly, the movie also has a nostalgic touch. I cannot say that I lived in the Bay Area in the 1970s, but anyone who did will probably have a rush of wistfulness watching this film. From the retro opening credits to the cars, costumes, and music, ""Zodiac"" effectively transports the audience to a bygone time. In a way, it partially feels like an homage to the neo-noir films of the Hollywood Renaissance.Overall, this is a homicide-detective thriller on the level of ""Silence of the Lambs."" Because it has its roots in true events, it is not the kind of thriller that leads up to a climactic shootout, yet it still holds our interest through the end. While the 2010s would likely turn this story into a miniseries, there is something sacred about an infamous true-crime narrative cleverly paced into a single movie, especially when David Fincher is overseeing and crafting it.",Zodiac

423,dsa_ca,Zodiac thrills and chills with fear of the unknown to save 2007,10,23 July 2007,"Zodiac is by far the best film of 2007. It has not been a dismal year for Hollywood with record box office collections all around, but quality wise it has taken a beating. Zodiac, even with good quality movies around, would have beaten them. So good is the direction that the maker almost successfully holds the viewers attention and keeps them at the edge of their seat without any violence and gore and that says a lot about how thrilling is the drama that is taking place on the screen.Zodiac is about the infamous zodiac killer of San Francisco in the late 60's and 70's. With the case still open in 2007 and no justice done, it would have been less gripping to concentrate on one of the famous suspect of the case. While keeping the killer unknown throughout the movie the director has concentrated his attention on the investigation and especially on the reporters of the daily newspaper 'san Francisco chronicles', to whom the killer used to send abstract letters (to other newspapers also) along with zodiac coded language at the daily's office, with a threat to print those letters in the next daily edition or the entire county would face his wrath with more killings. Only letter handwriting matching and fingerprints to hold the suspects along with many varied eyewitness accounts of there encounter with the zodiac killer, the police investigation was not going along smoothly. As the cult grows the panic and frustration starts gripping the investigators and the reporters who end up loosing everything for finding the killer, coming chillingly close to many suspects and the real one. Jake Gyllenhaal ( Broke back Mountain) as the cartoonist Robert Graysmith at the chronicles who remains involved in the case for almost four decades comes up with an ace performance. Robert Downey Jr. as the chronicles eccentric reporter Paul Avery who in his time while investigating the killer gets letters from the killer personally also comes up with a commendable performance along with Mark Ruffalo ( 13 going on 30 ) as the san Francesco police's chief investigation officer on the case. With dependable actors all around the director with no worries creates a chilling drama around the real facts of the killings and investigation. The film though chillingly real tends to loosen few nerves in the audience with use of good humor of the main characters during few serious sequences in the first half. But in the second half with police coming chillingly close to the 'real' killer and Graysmith's own maddening investigation grips and demands the audience's attention. The director successfully captures Robert Graysmith's fear and emotions while he personally investigates the killings to write a book chronicling the events surrounding the killings, as he becomes victim of the killers nerve-wrecking midnight calls at his home. With the killer remaining unknown throughout the film the audience is gripped by various emotions all along, with no respite after the movie ends.The movie remains in the audience's mind as the ending credits briefs them about the various progresses the investigation had made. The movie is definitely close to a masterpiece in the crime genre. All thumbs up.",Zodiac
424,Solipsisticblog,Slow burn procedural rewards the patient,10,13 March 2007,"The new David Fincher (""Seven"") film is as good as you have heard. Based on the book by Robert Graysmith, ""Zodiac"" is the true story of several San Franciso residents who become obsessed with discovering the identity of the serial killer calling himself ""Zodiac."" Robert Graysmith--played in the film by Jake Gyllenhaal in a subdued, fascinating performance--is an editorial cartoonist for the San Francisco Chronicle who gets caught up in the hunt after the killer sends a coded letter to his employer.Also on the hunt are crime reporter Paul Avery--a mesmerizing performance by Robert Downey Jr.--and homicide detectives Toschi (Mark Ruffalo) and Armstrong (Anthony Edwards). Toschi, Avery, and Graysmith each become obsessed with finding Zodiac and this obsession slowly begins to take over their lives and destroy them. Graysmith, while preparing a book about the killer, slips into paranoia. Audiences accustomed to the rhythms of the serial killer film will first accept and applaud Graysmith's paranoia. We know that with just a little more hunting, the vigilant reporter will crack the case. If he can just discover that one clue. We don't quickly realize that Graysmith's obsession and vigilance are unhealthy.Fincher continually subverts our expectations of the genre. Though like a police procedural--a story about the detective work that leads to capture of the villain--""Zodiac"" is the anti-procedural, the anti-""Law and Order"". While ""Law and Order"" makes us feel safe and shows us a neat and tidy justice system that successfully weeds out the guilty from the innocent, ""Zodiac"" is about the limits of justice, forensic work, questioning, and detection. Sometimes the justice system comes up short. Sometimes we can't detect and ascertain the guilty. And it is this uncertainty that wears on the hunters at the center of ""Zodiac"".The film is deliberate and methodical and is going to disappoint those looking for another exploitative entry in the slasher genre. There are several moments of horrific violence in the film that are among the most haunting ever filmed, but this is not a film that gets its jollies from carnage. Instead it shows it an unflinching, efficient, and brutal fashion. These moments, while horrifying, help us understand the fear of the people of San Francisco and the obsession of those who want to locate the killer.Unsettling, expertly crafted, and full of outstanding performances, ""Zodiac"" is a drama that respects the intelligence of audiences. It asks us to pay attention, frees itself from genre conventions, and takes its time to tell its tale. Certain to alienate viewers who want a quick bloody thrill, ""Zodiac"" is nonetheless the year's first great film.",Zodiac
425,Global_Marketing_Pros,"Plot analysis of Zodiac motives, a true story",6,8 April 2007,"This film is an excellent documentary. Its method of documentary the past is excellent. The cinematography in color and sound is also excellent. The reasoning for camera angles is the key to telling this story, just as the motives of the Zodiac killer himself. A logical design within a design for a theatrical plot.I camera angle is intended to give the audience a perspective. The audience is what the director intends to persuade with his story-telling in audio-visual format. This is curious since the director of this film eludes to certain facts about the Zodiac killer's character such as listening to record playing music, the type of pistol used, the type of knife used. How was the record of history used? The logical motives of the Zodiac killer was to instill fear in the police by terrorism of children at random. Then supposedly he followed up with phone calls to file their complaint to the authorities. In this movie his complaint was that his lust for terror could not be satisfied no matter how many persons he killed. His lust for the method of killing was also a great influence to his motivation. The use of guns and knives physical violence, while it was communicated to the authorities by himself.Why did the killer use record music in this film. What was the killer listening to? The Zodiac was a clever code like any language. A logical code based on survival instincts, to feed a hunger. Not like a hunger for food, which was the one intent of the original Zodiac to depict seasonal change for farming. I was based on what we see in the sky, in the stars as direction in our lives. Maybe, he felt like the director in this film when he could hear the beautiful music at his command.The Zodiac killer is said to have enjoyed killing people more than wild animals. His intentions to conceal his identity within the Zodiac code is curious as the human nature of language itself. Why would both a phone call and written letters be used? Why not just one method of communication. The audio-visual nature of the communication process denotes a separation in the thought process into two motives. The psychosis of what is heard is admission, because the admission of enjoying human torture and death is also self annihilation. The visual code would indicate a second motive to conceal, or mislead, or further terrorism. As with both audio and visual a record can be made as knowledge, this record is his command of reality.The Zodiac Killer hence enjoys the record he is making of a command of death for humans, and his reality. Because there is some selection process. The Zodiac is human nature's way to determine direction, and time of year. It is at the time of the Zodiac Killer an international coordinate system that is codified as a science. Just as the criminal justice process was codified as a science. His killing tactics however, contradict both his motives and science. His killing tactics are based on terrorism, intimidation, and homicide. His command of science with the use of the Zodiac, writing, and the telephone suggest a logical modus. Hence a planned motive of audio-visual evidence.I note that given the time period of the Zodiac killer the use of the telephone was not known to be recorded as 911 calls are today for evidence. Or the science and technology for use was not public, thus expert witness of criminal justice system was manipulated to possibly expose some hidden secret of planned homicide and use of telecommunications for criminal justice.",Zodiac

The Zodiac also inspired a famous manhunt and many obsessions. Zodiac was never captured. Obsession is what the film mainly captures.""Zodiac"" stars Oscar nominees Jake Gyllenhaal and Robert Downey Jr. along with a supporting cast including Mark Ruffalo, Anthony Edwards, and John Carroll Lynch. ""Zodiac"" is possibly the greatest crime-drama ever made. Not boring at all, but not a slasher flick (thank God), but a character-driven drama. This great thriller is also directed by acclaimed filmmaker David Fincher (Fight Club, Se7en).Robert Graysmith (Gyllenhaal) is a cartoonist with the San Francisco Chronicle. Paul Avery (Downey Jr.) is a top crime-reporter for the same newspaper. In August of 1969 a letter is received with a code taking credit for three murders of teenagers in nearby Solano county, the only signature is a cross-hair symbol at the bottom of the letter. After that he sends another letter to give full closure that he is the killer but this time identifying himself as ""the Zodiac"". The Zodiac strikes again in a bizarre stabbing Napa county. Still the police are no closer to catching him.Graysmith obviously has an obsession and Avery gains a professional interest in the young man. Soon after the killer strikes again in San Francisco, this time killing a lone cab-driver. Inspectors David Toschi and Bill Armstrong (Ruffalo and Edwards) are put on the case.Graysmith and Avery team up in attempt in catching the killer. While the investigators representing the three Zodiac terrorized counties exclude suspect after suspect (including John Carroll Lynch as the infamous Arthur Leigh Allen). The case goes nowhere for years but that doesn't stop Graysmith, he beings writing the book, ""Zodiac"" and tries to solve the case and he comes to one conclusion of the killer's identity.This movie is highly fictionalized, only about 35% accurate. It is still a great movie. I highly recommend it to any crime/mystery-thriller fans.10/10",Zodiac
428,Degree7,"A recreation, not a dramatization.",5,11 November 2013,"Complaints about Zodiac being 'too slow' and laboured compared to David Fincher's other thrillers are not unfounded. Repeated viewings have confirmed that while the story as a whole sticks out in one of the most interesting failed manhunts of the 20th century America, Zodiac suffers from too much technicality and not enough characterization. The filmmakers spend an economical amount of time with the characters, but we never delve into the psychological framework of their minds the same way we do say, with John Doe in ""Seven"". Even though he spends 90% if the time off screen, the villain of Fincher's sophomore film was more completely and subtly explored using mise-en-scene. When the detectives explore the killer's labyrinthine network of notes and personal possessions in his hideout, it offers a window into his head and how he must observe the world. A hell-ish, biblical purgatory. In Zodiac, we never get that exploration, not with the villain (who remains true to fact, anonymous) nor the many protagonists. We never get long, quiet scenes lingering over their private lives with their families, never a question into what makes them tick other than the simple basis of what their job entails, as reporters and detectives.Zodiac moves along at a brisk pace, rarely stopping for reflection or contemplation. It is a simple docudrama recounting of the days stemming from the murders, but it is too lengthy and detached to justify its role as a character study, of which there is little studying to be done. The best scenes in the film are the ones that aren't rushed, but dawdle idly with faint sense of foreboding. The killer is never seen, but the Zodiac's innate and disturbed presence can be felt to hover in purse moments. His identity is maddeningly hinted at, but never confirmed. All Fincher can accomplish is lead suspicion towards certain suspects. While the first hour has a definite drive with the subsequent murders, once the killer leaves the populace' mind and remains as a mark of obsession on the characters, so does the film slowly leave our interests as viewers. The dead ends and blind alleys are a curious enough recounting of the events, but serve more as a reminder of the failed police procedure of the time and the hindrance in the lack of technological assurance of the 1970s. Zodiac works better as a warning against future failures of the media and police work, than an effective statement of the era. For all it's pomp and self-assuredness, Zodiac lacks a throbbing heart.",Zodiac
429,nived84,"""This is the Zodiac speaking.""",10,4 March 2007,"For those who are expecting David Fincher's latest film to be another Seven, don't. Zodiac bares more in resemblance to Oliver Stone's JFK than it does to The Silence of the Lambs. Seen through the perspective of the journalists and police investigators involved in the legendary unsolved case, the film provides no solid culprit and involves very little on-screen violence. But remember this is a Fincher film, and his real talent is juicing the maximum out of what little he puts on display. The murder sequences (there are three shown here) are brutal, unflinching and cold. For the first time it feels nervously uncomfortable to be watching a film about a serial killer, especially since what we're seeing is fact, not fiction. Particularly chilling is the opening murder and the lakeside attack, while both warming up with a sly amount of playful comedy, quickly and utterly shoots to painful and realistic grim reality. There's no slow motion, no quick cut-aways, no musical score  just violence, in it's most simplest and basic form, and it sent chills down my spine.This is a crime-drama that's about as by the book as one could make, and that's both the film's strength and weakness. The film is less and less about actual character's, instead it's more focused on showing us the compulsive obsession that the case had on those who where desperately trying to stop the Zodiac. The film begins in July of '68 and ends in 1991, and if you're not prepared for it, it just might feel like it too. Jake Gyllenhaal plays Robert Graysmith (the author of the book for which the film is based on), a cartoonist for the San Francisco Chronicle and puzzle geek, who becomes obsessed with solving the case. Robert Downey Jr stars in yet another great performance (who is quickly becoming one of my favorite actors) as Roger Avery, a crime reporter for the Chronicle, who is assigned to cover the Zodiac killings, and in doing so becomes a target himself and it ultimately costs him his career (and probably his health too). Mark Ruffalo and Anthony Edwards star as two San Francisco detectives, Toschi and Armstrong, working the case of a cabbie that was executed by the Zodiac. When their investigation goes from hot leads that end up going cold, the two lose their hope of ever catching the killer, and in steps Graysmith, the puzzle geek that just can't seem to keep the Zodiac off his mind. His obsession with the case ends up costing him his marriage, but like a hunting dog, he's on the case, and comes closer to nabbing the killer than any other person.If the film hadn't been based on an actual unsolved case this would have been boring as hell and extremely anti-climatic, but fortunately that's not the case. I found myself utterly transfixed and fascinated by the case and that was enough for me to get sucked into, so much so I barely ate any of my popcorn. The way Zodiac is shot reminded me a lot of films from the 70's, like the nervous paranoia of Francis Ford Coppola's The Conversation and the ""just the facts"" mentality of a serious-minded investigation similar to Alan Pakula's All the President's Men. Both solid and great films of that era, before fax machines and cell phones, an era that director David Fincher brings back to vivid life (as if it were almost yesterday) with the gloomy cinematography, which is shot in High-Definition, looks absolutely stellar, and the costumes which don't distract our attention away from the story. I loved all the references to Bullit, Dirty Harry and even the display of a little Pong action.Much like the case itself, Zodiac isn't a sprint  it's a marathon. Expect a very detailed investigative drama with suspense and intrigue sprawled out over a 160 minute running time, and considering the end result of the case, the ending feels maddening, but justifiably so. I know I'll definitely be watching this one again and again on DVD. Hell, I might even go see it again this week, just to be able to process it all. This is quite easily the most complex and mature of all of the films in Fincher's expanding career. And it's no less of challenge than his previous films, it's not quite the eerie disturbing nature of Seven or the raw brutality of Fight Club, this is mental and exhaustive brutality; which captures the frustration and anxiety of the rare and memorable unsolved case down to every clue and false lead.",Zodiac

Why Jake was on a trippin' mission to find the killer, only one can imagine.There were several errors in the movie, and I will add them to the goofs section as soon as possible. There are roughly 4, two of which stand out very well. Look for them if you decide to watch the movie.Don't go to the theater and waste $10 or whatever, wait until it is free on Cable or Satellite.

433,jack_malvern,Clean Harry,5,9 May 2007,"David Fincher does a stand-up job of recreating 1960s San Francisco in this meandering real-crime thriller, but at two and a half hours it is simply too drawn-out to be enjoyable.Jake Gyllenhaal plays Robert Graysmith, a cartoonist on the San Francisco Chronicle who becomes increasingly obsessed with the activities of Zodiac, a serial killer with a penchant for confessional letters. He sees the letters at first hand when they arrive at the newspaper, hovers around the desk of the crime correspondent (Robert Downey Jr) and is ultimately moved to research the killings himself for what becomes his bestselling book on the unsolved murders.But while the story unfolds fairly evenly and with an impressive attention to detail, it is hampered by the inconvenient truth that Zodiac was never arrested, let alone convicted. It rather limits the story's progression, given that the police are no nearer to catching their man at the end than they are in the middle. The result is an epic accumulation of circumstantial evidence that, despite heavy doses of foreboding bass notes, is mildly intriguing rather than exciting.The last time Hollywood had a go at making a film of the Zodiac killings it came up with Dirty Harry, whose titular hero takes down his quarry with as much observance of due process as his .357 calibre Magnum will allow. Naturally, a realistic portrayal of the story isn't going to feature such pyrotechnics, but watching the cops capitulate to the goddam pencil-pushers at City Hall does not make for riveting viewing.Not that realism prevents Fincher from nailing his colours firmly to the mast when it comes to his preferred suspect, mind. I was almost convinced myself until one of the closing captions mentions that a recent DNA test all but exonerated him. But still, he's dead, so he's hardly in a position to sue.Gyllenhaal and Mark Ruffalo, as the dogged cop leading the investigation, put in creditable performances here, but Fincher should have known that the story was only worth 90 minutes.",Zodiac
434,sexytail,This Is The Real Thing,10,13 January 2008,"Over the course of the last 12 years I have, despite much resistance, become a David Fincher fan. My faith in him wavered in 2002 when he directed Koepp's less than stellar ""Panic Room"". In the five year gap following the release of that film I came to believe that I'd lost Fincher as a reliable director and that he'd lost his career. ""Zodiac"" restored my faith.This film is shot on high grade digital video and it is the only time I've ever seen video look like anything but video. Fincher's eye has transcended the boundaries of a once limiting medium. The color and motion are perfect. The word gorgeous would suffice. The three central performances are perfect as well, which is surprising because Gyllenhaal and Ruffalo really had something to prove for me. As with Brad Pitt in ""Se7en"", Fincher has given credibility to another couple of heartthrobs. The supporting cast (which includes the under-appreciated Elias Koteas) is awesome as well.Everything worked and this is proved by the fact that it kept me in my theater seat all 157 minutes in spite my bladder being stretched ever larger by an extra large coke. True crime is a popular subject for film and the story of the zodiac killer of the 1970s was made 3 other times within 2 years of this movie. Trailing behind failures like ""Hollywoodland"" and De Palma's ""The Black Dahlia"", ""Zodiac"" arrived at an opportune time. All these films concerned real life crimes. This is the only success among them, bladder or no bladder.""Zodiac"" is neither a dramatization or a documentary, it is a movie. The focus, apart from the actual murders played as they happened, is confined to three men (Jake Gyllenhaal, Robert Downey Jr., Mark Ruffalo) who were stricken with the obsession to stop the zodiac's reign of terror. This theme was also present in ""The Black Dahlia"", but as an over-dramatized b-movie. At the risk of sounding pretentious, I'll also say that it's a movie that takes an intelligent and honest look at how we react to and deal with mass murderers.The fact that nobody knows who this killer is and never will know for certain presents an interesting problem dramatically. Perhaps accidentally, the solution is like a ""Citizen Kane"" in which we never meet Charles Foster Kane. As Rosebud was a ruse in that film, the killers identity proves equally to be a ruse because the journey is more important. This is the story of people in the wake of a madman.Naturally more focus goes to Gyllenhaal's Graysmith since this is the character of the book's author. His personal story of raising a child and having a girlfriend all being pushed to the back burner by his obsession might seem trivial at first, but it is played very well here. Fincher's good sense for drama and the proportion thereof is key here. Downey Jr. chews his scenes very successfully as a quirked, self centered reporter who perhaps best embodies the frustration at a mystery with no answer. Ruffalo is the cop who still believes in justice and is worn on by the publicity phenomenon that serial killers create (highlighted by a scenes where he sits down to watch ""Dirty Harry"" only to find it mirrors the case he's stumped on). All their characters feel fresh again because the viewer gets wrapped up in the story and forgets they're watching a movie.My least favorite words to find in the promotion of any movie ""Based on a true story"" followed closely by ""Inspired by actual events"". With a lot of films this device (and it's often no more than a device) is a crutch, an excuse to tell an uninteresting story badly and have all its failings of script etc. by ignored by an audience who keep telling themselves that what they're watching is in some way ""real"". This pretty much puts me off true stories, including true crime stories. ""Zodiac"" is one hell of an exception.",Zodiac

It sets a spark in the mind to what is out there and to puzzles, completed or uncompleted.Zodiac, the story of a serial killer, over many states and police departments, the case that was nearly forgotten and the case that thrilled many, in the force and the public.A clear 8 1/2 out of 10.",Zodiac
436,Listen_to_the_Law,Extremely Intriguing,9,15 April 2007,"Zodiac is a film about the serial killer (titled the 'Zodiac Killer') who terrorized the bay area from the late 60s to the late 70s. This is the real zodiac killer- not the fake one. I say that because horror movie Primeval, from earlier this year, dubbed the killer in that movie as the zodiac killer (along with a bunch of exaggerated titles), even though it was a crocodile. Ahem Zodiac is a movie of many genres: it begins as a horror, then dives into an intense drama. Once the story picks up, the movie becomes a thriller, then back to horror, and finally ending as a drama. Scenes that normally would be average are scary and intense. Conversations that would normally make an American yawn are surprisingly in-depth and interesting, all the while not going overboard to make an overly-complex story. After all, this movie is based, not inspired on, by true events.Anyways, about the story- it's insanely smart, well-directed and written, glorifying the Zodiac killer while at the same time giving the characters the same treatment. After his first few brutal murders, the killer mocks the San Francisco Chronicle and the San Francisco Police Department with letters mailed to them telling them just who he is and what he plans on doing next. Hard feelings develop between the paper and the Police Department, each of them believing that they are the ones who should solve the murders. Zodiac moves at a fast-paced style very smoothly, as the movie covers the whole case, from when it started in 1968 to when it unofficially ends in 1991.The Day After Tomorrow's Jake Gyllenhall is Robert Greysmith, a cartoonist for the Chronicle who has a crazy ability to remember things on no notice and a desire to finish what he (or anyone else, for that matter) starts. Columnist Paul Avery (Robert Downey, Jr.) works alongside Greysmith with the paper. These two are up against two large obstacles: the Zodiac killer and David Toschi (Mark Ruffalo), an inspector from the SFPD. It would seem that, you know, the capture of this deranged killer would be the important issue, but when duty calls, ego and the rules of hierarchy come into play. At first the two sides work together, but soon, Avery's independent antics and such cause the SFPD and the Chronicle to break off their unofficial partnership, which only started because they both received mailings from the Zodiac.Yes, Zodiac is 158 minutes long. But let me just put it this way: I nearly fell asleep in school that day that I saw this movie. I could barely workout due to my fatigue. But, somehow, I was alert throughout the entire movie. I look back at David Fincher's previous movie, Panic Room (2002), and notice that he has an eye for talent. Zodiac is a movie that I strongly recommend to those who like to think and be entertained at the same time. Odd combination.Good) Crazily thrilling and thought provoking, great acting, doesn't ""overdue it"" Bad) a little foggy here and there Jake Gyllenhall) Quick at picking up the phone Not as bad as it really was) Zodiac's portrayal of late 70s and early 80s clothing styles",Zodiac
437,kaustubh-rajnish,Fincher Comes of age...,8,5 October 2008,"David Fincher only directs in the thriller genre maybe because he has the expertise required to raise the tension. In his previous films he relied on funky background colours and dark filters to manipulate his viewers into unease eg fight club and se7en but he shows a totally different colour in Zodiac. One might expect a grim Fincher serial thriller which should show shocking scenes and super pop culture concepts.But Fincher knows better he is directing a film set in the 60's  70's and it's based on real life elements. He thus approaches it in a documentary like way, more like an 'all the presidents men' type thrillers where characters are not philosophy spewing space monkeys but normal everyday plausible killers As a matter of fact he portrays the serial killer as the most deglamourized serial killer ever seen. The zodiac killer is just a normal everyday guy who acts on his whims and fancies but tries to sound cryptic. At no point of time you feel the zodiac is a genius and catching him would be an unachievable feat. What does make him elusive are police jurisdictions and time lapses spread across geographies.Three central characters get entangled in the search of the zodiac : A puzzle loving Cartoonist Graysmith (Gyllenhal - brilliant) on whose book the movie is based, a stylish 70s reporter of san Francisco chronicle (Robert Downey, most probably himself) and a serious no nonsense cop (Ruffalo  fairly engaging).The film transpassses (is there is such a word) thirty years to give us a feeling of how laborious the task became and shows how lives of the three central characters got severely affected by the in vain hunt of the killer.There are moments in the film which will make your blood pressure rise like a basement scene which is bound to go down in cinematic history as the one of the most nerve tingling ever.Zodiac is definitely a film which would feature in the bottom half of almost all top ten lists of all time serial killer movies. It also marks a sort of coming to age of the David Fincher who is headed to be one of the classic directors of all times. Recommended.",Zodiac
438,aFrenchparadox,Efficient,7,21 September 2010,"A thriller without real action from times to times is something pretty rare, I guess because it's hard to maintain people's attention (and also because this action remains on catching the bad guy, which is obviously absent here). 'Zodiac' does this trick: proportionally long to the investigation, it however keeps you interested all along. The reconstitution of the timeline is one of the other good points of the film. Fashion, characters, San Francisco: everything evolves while the investigation treads water. Finally it's a nice description of how sometimes people vest with their job as if it was a mission. So stubbornly they lose everything else which made their life so far. The question is why, what are they avoiding. And the film doesn't answer to this. But it doesn't pretend to do it either, so fair enough.",Zodiac

440,greggwager,How to Depict a Real-to-Life Curse,9,21 June 2015,"A deranged killer taunts you to solve his gruesome cipher. If you take a stab at it, an invisible evil takes over, potentially wrecking both your professional and personal life.The movie ""Zodiac"" tells this true story more as an historical crime drama than ""mystery/who-done-it."" Since the original ""Dirty Harry"" movie was also based on the Zodiac murders, there is even an ongoing irony between its controversial and sensational brute force and the heroes in ""Zodiac,"" who steadfastly and patiently adhere to a respect for due process that leads to their bitter ruin (punctuated deftly by a scene depicting an actual SFPD screening of ""Dirty Harry,"" although the filmmakers very deliberately keep Clint Eastwood's image and voice from appearing on screen).David Fincher directs, originally hired so he could recreate the dark and creepy look of some of his previous films—with success. Otherwise, the script by Jamie Vanderbilt (nephew of famous etiquette guru Gloria) presumably adheres closely to Robert Graysmith's true crime books (I haven't read them yet), depicting events I remember as a child growing up in Sacramento.Because the story is told with real clues, letters, ciphers, handwriting analysis, and dysfunctional police theories, the model film that Vanderbilt, Fincher and producer Brad Fisher wanted to emulate was Alan J. Pakula's ""All the President's Men,"" although in the end this model is generously embellished upon. Serving as such an embellishment, a highly stylized use of music of the day includes Donovan, Vanilla Fudge, and other easily recognizable groups such as Sly and the Family Stone, along with an ambient original score by David Shire, who plays numerous eerie piano solos.Also overtly stylish are three sequences depicting real crimes, each shot and edited in a style reminiscent of teen thriller films from the 1950s and 60s. These scenes still blend well into the overall stark narrative, which includes several scenes in which the actors simply read the Zodiac letters aloud on and off camera.Although ""Zodiac"" appears in this way to be a fairly lean production, it nonetheless cost over $80 million to make. If you look carefully at the vintage cars and how certain scenes were recreated, you might figure out where some of the money was spent. Read the credits to the film and you'll also discover that the filmmakers were actually taking great pains to research the crimes depicted and had hired actual people involved in the true events as consultants.Not quite upstaging the ever-present invisible evil, friendly chemistry between the actors helps keep us engaged, especially between Jake Gyllenhaal and Robert Downey, Jr., as the journalists, and the two SFPD homicide detectives, played with remarkable understated precision by Mark Ruffalo and Anthony Edwards. Brain Cox portrays the famous Bay Area lawyer Melvin Belli with superb swagger.Amazingly, the realism of ""Zodiac"" distracts from remarkable continuity errors that remain hidden inside its twisted momentum. The Chief of Police of the City of Vallejo (played with seamless intensity by Elias Koteas, along with Donal Logue who similarly plays the Napa County detective) actually refers to Solano County as ""over the county line"" (Vallejo is in Solano County). Even worse is catching yourself believing that Graysmith's first date with his future wife Melanie (played with smart but sexy aplomb by Chloë Savigny) occurred shortly after a meeting at the gun range with his colleague Paul Avery, who then was supposed to have driven at least seven hours to Riverside in a clunker car; met with an anonymous source; collected handwriting samples from the local police; taken another eight-hour drive to Sacramento to have the handwriting analyzed; and managed to call Graysmith back all in one evening before sunrise.Fincher takes great pains to recreate the staff of the San Francisco Chronicle of that era, including publisher Charles De Young Thieriot (John Terry) and editors Templeton Peck (John Getz) and Al Hyman (Ed Setrakian). Although the nuances here are nowhere nearly as developed as in ""All the President's Men,"" it was good to see veteran actress and once Oscar nominee Candy Clark appearing briefly here and then as a secretary, as well as the crusty canteen operator Shorty (James Carraway).The passion of the drama still prevails, even if it leaves you wondering why the police in this case could never figure out that if the killer could check out a few books on ciphers from the library, he probably could have found something on handwriting analysis as well (the one thing that foils the police in the end). Still, the facts serving as clues that do eventually solve the puzzle are carefully chosen and revealed, suggesting my original interest was based on the filmmaker's exhaustive research and careful presentation.At least admire this film, if you don't love it. I nonetheless love its chemistry and clever ways of inserting humor inside an otherwise deeply morbid tale. Just don't try to analyze why it all works as if it was one of Zodiac's ciphers—you'll never be able to crack it.",Zodiac

But Fincher, true to his roots, seems to be unable to resist the ""alpha individual's effort has to be crowned with success""-syndrome.Anyway, ""Zodiac"" does better than ""Se7en"", coming as a pleasantly humble sibling-counterpart to the perverted extravaganza of the latter.",Zodiac

448,thebengalimafia-1,A great movie!,10,18 February 2008,"A ruthless killer strikes fear into Californian citizens in the late 60s and early 70s. What unfolds is the investigation of one of the most infamous events in history. After murdering his victims, the killer calls the police and tells them of the murders. He then sends ciphers to the Chronicle, a local newspaper. With witnesses that survived their ordeals and a mountain of evidence that points at everyone's favorite suspect, no one is able to catch the Zodiac killer.The majority of the film spans over the course of a decade from the first murder and the final scene is considerably later; twenty two years after the first murder. In a film that is a little over two and a half hours long, director David Fincher gives the audience a myriad of characters and we need to become familiar with at least 8 or 10 of them. Luckily for us, there's never a point where you feel lost in all the names and faces. Even better yet, there is never a point where you feel as if you're watching Mark Ruffalo, Robert Downey Jr. or Jake Gyllenhaal. You're watching real people doing their jobs. Paul Avery (Robert Downey Jr.), a chain smoking alcoholic that writes for The Chronical eventually loses his job after being marked by the Zodiac and drinking himself into limitless stupor. Apparently Avery said something in the Chronicle about the Zodiac that made him angry and made Avery a marked man.Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal) becomes lost in his monster that's trying to put the puzzle together and his wife leaves him in the process. The film is like a crime investigation with some comedy thrown in. There are never any ""overly done"" scenes with gratuitous killing or cheap thrills; it's more about going through a labyrinth of information and being able to narrow down the suspects. Mark Ruffalo turns in a gritty, by the book performance as David Toschi the man investigating the Zodiac killings. Toschi at one point was accused of sending new ciphers to the Chronicle and the police department he word at in an effort to revitalize interest in the case and to get himself more media coverage. He was, after all, the model for Clint Eastwood's portrayal of Dirty Harry.I don't know if it ever occurred to Graysmith that he was putting himself and his family in danger by investigating (rather publicly) the Zodiac killings. I mean he gets calls in the middle of the night and someone on the other end is breathing heavily. Graysmith even comes face to face with someone who I thought for a split second was the Zodiac or had something to with the murders anyway. There's a scene in the basement that has more nail biting tension than all thee of the Bourne films put together. I kept screaming (in my head), ""Get the hell out of there!"" David Fincher, the genius that gave us Se7en and Fight Club is back. Fincher has a cinematic style that is part indie, part classic film making. This was probably the reason that Fincher chose to shoot Zodiac entirely on a high-definition digital camera. Now I don't mean the Michael Mann (Collateral, Ali, Miami Vice) type with high-def tapes, I'm talking about a hard drive camera. Everything was then backed up on two separate 40 TB hard drives. TB stands for terabyte and a terabyte is 1000 gigabytes which is a lot more than your iPod.In an age where movies are written, shot, and edited as if they were trailers and nothing more, David Fincher keeps it old school. He's the last of the classic Hollywood all stars, and Zodiac delivers every step of the way.",Zodiac
449,klesker,Fincher goes 70's,9,2 October 2007,"Now I would like to take the Mark Kermode route of reviewing. He always states: ""you should go into every movie with an open mind"". Now I frankly find that impossible. I'll always have bias towards certain movies. Despite generally negative reviews, I still insisted the Spider-Man 3 would kick ass. It sucked. I avoided Dreamgirls and the Devil Wears Prada due to the fact that they were chick-flicks. Both turned out to pretty damn good.Now there is a point here. I am a MASSIVE fan of David Fincher, I even think Alien 3, a movie which Fincher himself has disowned, isn't that bad. Se7en is one of the greatest serial killer movies ever and Fight Club, his masterpiece, is just a great great Great film. The Game and Panic Room, although fitting neatly into the constraints of their chosen genres, are damn fine movies. So to say I could go into Zodiac, one of my most eagerly awaited movies of this year, with an open mind, was gonna be a feat more mammoth than Tony Blair's spin Doctor's keeping him popular. I sat down with my girlfriend, turned on the T.V. sat back and watched.But as I was watching, I noticed something. Now it does fit all the Fincher trademarks: every single detail is in frame, each frame is beautifully shot, etcbut, after such a long wait for a new Fincher movie (Panic Room was WAY back in 2002), it almost didn't seem like a Fincher movie almost as much as it did. It was much more. It was a very Mature picture (note the capital M). There's no Tyler Durden spewing his anti-corporate bilge, no Jodie Foster looking shocked and menaced, what there is, is a meticulously planned and expertly executed police drama. Some American critics criticised it for it's lack of action and lack of focus on the murder scenes. This really isn't that kind of movie. If anything it's a character study in the guise of a detective story. By the end of the movie we know each character in and out, their flaws, their motivation, what makes them tick and what scares them. It all just so happens to culminate during the time the Zodiac was active.But it is also a detective story and a terrific one at that! It's so compelling, going from the actual investigation itself to Graysmith's obsession towards the end. As is Fincher's style, he studied each character and every inch of the case for years prior to filming. And it shows. The investigative scenes have never been this good since the days of Serpico and Dirty Harry. It may be 40years passed but this looks every bit as 60's/70's as the movies of that era. It echoes Dirty Harry, The French Connection and all those in between.In so many words, this is up there with the great films of this decade let alone the year. Along with the likes of United 93, Million Dollar Baby and City of God, this is a modern classic. I knew I wouldn't be disappointed but I was in awe of this picture. They should only allow a few select directors make movies and if Fincher churns out movies like this from now on I would be a very happy film-goer. This is sheer brilliance, a masterpiece, a crowning achievement of film making that can rarely duplicated.5/5",Zodiac
450,marlyly,Interesting,7,4 October 2008,"I don't know much about the case of Zodiac outside of this film, so I can't really comment on how close to the truth the story of this film is, or how well each person played their part in comparison to their real-life counterpart. However, I can comment on this film for what it is - a fascinating story of a cartoonist's search for the identity of a serial killer who all else seem to have given up on ever finding.The pacing of the film is slow, but if I'm honest, that's the type of pacing that I prefer, where the director lets things build up rather than adopting the 'thrill-a-second' approach that certain directors have taken with their films lately. The acting was good - I'm usually a big fan of Jake Gyllenhaal but I wasn't really blown away by his performance in this film - it was OK, he played his part, but I didn't really connect with the character at any point. I was impressed by Robert Downey Jr, who plays a believable Paul Avery, but my favourite performance of the film by far was by Mark Ruffalo as David Toschi - he really made the character his own.The plot is interesting, but of course limited due to being based on real life case. I've heard people complain that the ending is unsatisfactory as we never 'really' find out who the Zodiac killer is - only who he 'probably' is, but I'm pleased the film chose to stay true to the facts rather than adopt a more Hollywood 'all loose strings tied' approach. I can't really pick any faults with this film, the acting is great, the script is faultless, the direction brilliant, but I've still given it four stars instead of five because, although there's nothing really wrong with it, it's still missing a certain something that makes it extra special. Some films have it, some don't, and sadly this film falls into the latter category. But that's not to say this is a bad film at all - in fact, it is a very good one - just not the greatest.",Zodiac
451,ArmsAndMan,This is Boredom Speaking,4,5 March 2007,"Compared with Se7en and Fight Club, Zodiac plays like a thoughtful PBS documentary. Critics are praising Fincher for what appears to be a movement towards mature storytelling. Sorry, no sale.Individual scenes are gripping and, on occasion, suspenseful, but the gentle viewer must slog through mundane procedures that lead nowhere. Imagine a formless, three-hour CSI episode directed by Robert Altman, with no single character who takes the lead, no cohesive story arc, and no conclusion: there you have it, Zodiac.I can't blame David Fincher, per se, because the source material is so diffuse, and the purported central character, Robert Graysmith, is so weak and peripheral. You stagger out of this movie like a survivor of a bad dinner party where everyone holds forth on the meaning of life... except everyone in the room has a combined IQ of 7. Hmmm. Seven?

Now two and a half hours sounds longer than they felt. Although the movie isn't really fast paced, I couldn't make out any particular lengthy parts.But it's fleeting by. There are about three dozen leaps in the time setting, every other scene starts with ""x days/weeks/years later"". And with no time spend at any date, there is no time to really flesh out the characters. Of which there are a lot. Probably too many. Only one got any kind of tangible background, but it's still not enough to make him credible.Lots of characters on the other hand give lots of fine actors a chance to show their skills. The cast is brilliant. Fine, seasoned actors, most of whom you'll likely have seen before.I liked the pace of the movie, despite the ""fleetiness"" it's told without haste and very dry, none of the flashy visual gimmicks you'd come to expect from David Fincher.What really precludes a higher rating than 6/10 is the absence of either a climax or a satisfying conclusion.",Zodiac

454,motezart,Good Edition to the Serial Killer Genre,8,7 February 2014,"Now that the criminal mastermind flick has become a set type, widely overdone, this film tends to get easily shrugged off as yet another film about an ultra-intelligent serial killer who is always one step ahead of the cops, yes just like Seven. Still though, this film is quite different. Zodiac has nowhere near as much internal darkness bursting from its seams.But Zodiac is dark, just not Seven dark. Even though Zodiac is still a murder-thriller, it's tone compared to Seven, is a like a lovely ray of sunshine. Being that this storyline is all loosely based on actual events, enacting the film out in the time period during which it occurred, the late 60's-early 70's gives the film a freshness, a nostalgia that seems to come with those decades.The plot: In an age before mail bombs and anthrax scares, a killer toys with his pursuers by leaving complex clues just above their tracker's radars, just out of reach of their capabilities, the chase then becomes perpetual, the madness wide spread- reporters, cops, victim's families, all exposed to the madness. Society engulfing.The lighting, the darkness, the shadows, the string dissonance, and the rain of course: all hugely important to Fincher's work, perhaps his most important set of tricks, perhaps they could even be called Finchinian, or would it be Ficheresque? They pop up in all this films.In the real tense bits we get close, claustrophobic shots, bare-bones dialogue, tense body language, the potential victim's fear seeping almost literally thought the screen, then BAM! Scene complete. No sentimentality.None of Fincher's tactics in creating suspense come across as clichés. These are textbook lessons in how to frame a successful suspense scene. In a thriller the actor is a part of the puzzle. Like a part of complex musical arrangement, all the players need to play their parts perfectly.In thrillers the character is thrown into an extreme situation, an abyss created by the filmmaker, and Zodiac, unlike Panic Room, is a bottomless abyss. Great performances are made by the actor's that find the rawest, ravenous ways to claw their ways out, even if the character fails.During Zodiac, Jake Gyllehaal was still coming up in the ranks. He had not fully moved on to the badass action hero roles he plays today and in his underling position in the film, as a cartoonist constantly getting in the way of the ""real"" reporters, he becomes an interesting underdog of a main character, even though he's not supposed to be the main attraction. A pleasure to watch, we know, and he knows, he is in a subservient role and he never breaks out of it .Thrillers are the king of film as the symphony is king of music. Great symphonies are difficult to execute. So many elements, so many moving parts, everything must align perfectly, so when that moment of suspense is created, in both thriller and symphony, whether scene of movement, we stand in awe.Zodiac has those moments.More reviews at getthebonsaw.blogspot.com",Zodiac
455,slimjack,A good police procedural but a poor psychological study,8,13 March 2007,"The Zodiac was a serial killer active in San Francisco during the early 1970's. Unlike others of his kind, the Zodiac loved publicity and courted it religiously. He sent letters and coded messages to newspapers and police. During one killing he wore a complicated hood and cloak costume with his zodiac symbol emblazoned on the front. Another murder was done simply for the press and to tweak the cops. Horribly he got away with all this. The Zodiac killer was never caught. Because of this Zodiac the movie combines a police procedural with a study of the psychological effects the fruitless search had on its participants.Zodiac tries to concentrates on two individuals, Robert Graysmith, a political cartoonist who becomes obsessed with the killer and David Toschi, one of the cops assigned to the case. To appreciate the psychological toll obsession takes you have to come to know its victims. Despite the movie's long running time we never get that close to Graysmith or Toschi. Part of this is the actors fault. As Graysmith Jake Gyllenhaal is a cipher. He never seems any more than an amiable young man and his inner life remains something to be guessed at. Mark Ruffalo, as Toschi, is a better actor than his compatriot but his part is written as standard TV cop fare. Toschi resembles an amusing Columbo clone rather than a real cop with twenty five years experience. Another hindrance in understanding these two is that we simply don't spend enough time with them. Zodiac must have a hundred speaking roles with an array of secondary characters that easily outshine the leads. Robert Downy plays Roger Avery, a reporter assigned to the Zodiac case, as a smart-alec hipster undone by the '70's drug culture. Brian Cox plays flamboyant criminal lawyer and part time actor Melvin Belli for all the parts worth, which is about every stick of scenery within his reach. As a suspect John Carroll Lynch seems normal but just creepy enough to give one pause. Charles Fleischer outdoes Lynch on the creepy scale as a source who may be more than he seems. These characters flit in an out as the case rises and falls, all drawing attention away from Gyllenhaal and Ruffalo. It becomes increasingly clear is that Zodiac isn't really interested in their characters. The movie would much rather dwell on the search for and identification of the Zodiac Killer.It is as a police procedural that Zodiac shines. The facts of the case are clearly, almost lovingly delineated. Or, more accurately, Zodiac gives a very complete illusion of delineation. For Zodiac is compelled to give us the killer in a famously unsolved case. Yes, this is the suspect Graysmith and many of those involved with the case truly believe to be the killer and Zodiac is careful to point out the evidence presented is circumstantial. There can be, however, a huge gulf between what a movie pays lip service to and what it implies dramatically.It must be remembered that Zodiac is based on a book by a man whose psychological health depended on finding the killer. A multi-million dollar movie also has a need for closure. A police procedural needs a conclusion to proceed to. Otherwise you leave your audience frustrated and a frustrated audience is a small, unprofitable audience. Bear that in mind as you watch Zodiac. As informative as the movie is, distrust its conclusions. The real Zodiac was never caught. No one was prosecuted. Everything else is, at best, informed conjecture. Keeps this thought close and you will find Zodiac fine, thought provoking entertainment.",Zodiac
456,Spinetinglers,"Four Men, One Obsession: Who is the Zodiac?",10,27 February 2008,"On December 20th, 1968, Darlene Ferrin and Mike Mageau are shot. Darlene dies and Mike lives. Seven months later, the San Francisco Chronicle receives a letter in which the writer claims he is Darlene's killer and intends to kill again. This letter would not only terrify the public, but would start an obsession for four men. This obsession would ruin marriages and careers. For the next two decades, these four men were fixated on one question, one that would never be completely answered, a question that may, within itself, be just as dangerous as finding the answer: Who is the Zodiac? Zodiac is a superb film that is as realistic and authentic as a film based on actual events film can be. It is filled with characters who can only be inspired by actual people. The film boasts an excellent cast, with every actor contributing scintillating performances. Robert Downey, Jr., is charismatic and quirky as Paul Avery, bringing this character to life, as the audience witnesses his descent from a funny and brilliant ace reporter to a practically unemployable alcoholic. Anthony Edwards is pensive and understated as the cop who cannot handle the pressure of an unsolved case. Mark Ruffalo's Detective Dave Toschi is a determined and streetwise cop whose frustration almost consumes him, as each lead produces insufficient evidence to charge a suspect. Finally, Jake Gyllenhaal's Robert Graysmith is funny and heartwarming as the cartoonist-turned-amateur-sleuth, who comes the closest to solving the crime.The director, David Fincher, is masterful at bringing the dark and macabre to the screen and he does not disappoint with Zodiac. The attacks are not as dark or elaborate as those seen in his previous film, Se7en, yet the director still manages to portray each murder as cold, callous, and shocking. The story is brilliantly told in chronological order, starting with the first victims. We see what starts off as a routine murder investigation grow out of control, as two detectives and two reporters become consumed by the hunt for the Zodiac murderer. These four stories are presented in a way that seems believable and genuine. Their obsession seems to leap off the screen and touch its audience. As the film progresses, the viewer also becomes obsessed with the pursuit of the killer. However, this pursuit is not going to end with Harry Callahan shooting the killer dead. There is no neat Hollywood ending to this film; it will not answer all of your questions. In fact, you will find yourself asking that same question  Who is the Zodiac? The DVD extras contain the usual mix of trailers, but it also contains a ""featurette"" on the making of the movie. Fincher fans will love this. If you are not convinced that Fincher strived to create a film that was both authentic and unbiased, you will be after watching this insight into his process. The Zodiac DVD is available for purchase on September 24th.",Zodiac
457,doveed,The Perfect Execution of a Challenging Subject,8,31 October 2018,"I'll tell you a quick story about my viewing of this film. The DVD for Zodiac had been sitting on my TV for about 2 weeks. The day before I saw it, I went to the library and browsed through the true crime section. I noticed a very small book about the Zodiac killer, filled with photos and large print. Since I was about to see the movie, I decided to read this book, which took about an hour. What I thought is that it would be very difficult to adapt into an engaging movie. There were a lot of interesting elements, but not what you would call riveting, and certainly not Hollywood.The movie stayed true to this small book in terms of subject matter (there is a full novel about Zodiac, which the movie is based on). Events played out somewhat how I imaged, except that it worked so darn well. The story of the Zodiac killer is probably the seed for a lot of the sensationalized serial killer movies over the years, including Se7en which David Fincher also directed. Fincher could have sensationalized this story if he wanted, but he trusted the material and gave an honest account of the real events that took place. There was nothing too fancy about the execution of this piece - it was just filled with all the right moves. To me, that's one of Fincher's trademarks as a director.If you haven't seen it, I won't ruin it. I'll just say that this film doesn't deliver what you expect from a serial killer movie, but that turned out to be one of its strengths. Great directing, great acting, great everything. I don't give it 10 out of 10, only because it's not on the same level as THE GODFATHER and other movies that reach the ultimate level. But for what it is, it's absolutely perfect.",Zodiac

460,ctg0724,what happened David?,4,5 March 2007,"Fight Club, Seven, Panic Room. All of these great films. Knowing that David Fincher has earned the reputation to not fail to impress, I went into Zodiac opening night, but didn't leave astonished. I mean sure, it had a good cast. It was shot in Thomson Viper. And yeah, it did have three pretty cool murder scenes. But none of that makes up for the two hours of talk about handwriting. Unless your interest is in journalism or studying to become a forensic scientist for reading ransom letters, I do not recommend this movie.This film is quick to lose your attention and cause you to go ADD faster than Jake Gyllenhaal. Sorry, David.Maybe next time.",Zodiac
461,brent-27849,Same as before,1,9 March 2021,"I remembered watching this movie when it first came out, thinking it was a long boring slog. I decided to watch it again to see if perhaps I missed something. No, it's still the same boring slog. Only worse because I had forgotten just how paper thin the characters were, unforgiveable in a two hour thirty minute movie that is supposed to be a character study, and the fact that it's basically just watching the same movie twice, coming to the same pointless conclusion.Partly because it's way too episodic. I just get given a bunch of dates that mean nothing to me as years pass by and nothing happens. Except Anthony Edwards decides to quit, as though that's supposed to mean something, and Robert Downey Jr. turns into a wasted drunk, which means even less, Mark Ruffalo hangs around the same street, I assume still eating animal crackers, what attention to character, and then Jake Gyllenhaal decides to get really involved, one second he's having his first date, then he's married with a family, then she's gone and he's obsessed, oh well, didn't care at the beginning, the middle or the end. And yeah, I get it, it's supposed to show how each person's life gets ruined trying to track the killer. Still don't care. Especially Downey, as though what, only people who track killers end up drunks, drug users and throwing their lives away? Must be a whole lot of people in the world tracking killers then. Never once do I believe any of them, again especially Downey, maybe I thought his performance was better the first time, but now it all just comes across as the same hack performance he's been giving for the past twenty years, hey look, it's me, Robert Downey Jr, acting, aren't I so cool?What really bugged me the second time though was that it's the same story, told twice, first Ruffalo, then Gyllenhaal, each going through the same thing to come to the same conclusion. What bugs me is that it's sneaky, as though just because two people come to the same conclusion of who the killer is, that must mean something. Now I have no dog in the fight, I don't care whether John Carrol Lynch's character was the killer or not, but as I said, it's a cheap way to try and convince what is obviously your own opinion as fact; oh yeah, guy never went to trial, was never convicted, but yeah, he must have been the killer because certainly if Ruffalo and Gyllenhaal think so, then it must be true.Forget the fact that the prime evidence, the handwriting and the DNA were never linked to him. No, but you see, he acts kind of creepy, in the movie, and he wore boots, my goodness, there's your killer, is everyone blind? Even accepting that is true, then just how unbelievably incompetent do the police, especially Ruffalo, have to be? Naturally that's not what the movie wants people to focus on, but I sure as heck did. I mean, there's Gyllenhaal, I don't know how many years after the fact, giving Ruffalo all this evidence that points to who the killer must be; so what, Ruffalo never once figured that out himself, like the phone calls that stopped while Lynch was in jail for another crime? Like, does he not have a calendar? Yet it's presented like oh my god, can you believe it? No, what I believe is that the police investigating this must have been a bunch of Barney Fyfe's if with all this amazing evidence, they couldn't even bring charges against the guy in what, like over twenty years? Amazing.But then, maybe it all does make sense. After all if one person thinks something completely moronic and stupid, then it doesn't mean anything. But if two people think the same idiotic thing, well then it must just be true? And can you imagine if it's three or four, or a thousand? Or a corporation? Or media? Oh, but where can people gather who all have the same dumb ass ideas and then use that power to institute their unbelievable stupidity? Oh where, oh where can that possibly be? Yeah, kind of explains this whole world. Maybe I spoke too soon, way to go, Fincher, you were way ahead of your time.",Zodiac

463,ozymandiaskingofkings,Magnificent!,9,1 July 2009,"With the release of ""Zodiac"", David Fincher's second foray into serial killer territory after the magnificent ""Seven"", many eagerly attempted to compare the two, but in reality, they are very different beasts. ""Seven"" was a deeply claustrophobic movie, set in dark buildings under a perpetual night, offering only the limited perspective of the detectives as they tried to solve a horrific series of crimes over a very short period of time, whereas ""Zodiac"" is almost the opposite, appearing undeniably agoraphobic, a sprawling and almost holistic view of an unsolved crime encompassing a massive timescale, a large cast of central characters and a much more complex and Byzantine plot, encompassing not only the case, but the context and culture in which it occurred.The storyline is, on paper, deceptively simple. A serial killer with a penchant for sending codes and clues to the authorities is at work in 70s San Francisco, while the cops and a group of journalists from the Chronicle (who each received his letters) try to uncover his identity. When the search is fruitless and the murders stop, the cops give up the case, while crime reporter Paul Avery (Robert Downey Jr), by now an alcoholic obsessive, is fired from the Chronicle. So far, so historical.However, most of the film takes place in the decade following this as Avery's friend Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal), the Chronicle's cartoonist, cracks the cypher and begins his own investigation to find Zodiac's identity and finally lay the case to rest. It is here that the film spirals into a complex tapestry of red herrings, conjecture and clues as we follow his obsessive and at times haphazard search for the killer that keeps turning up results, but is ultimately far from conclusive. Suspects that seem almost certain to be the killer are discounted whereas others are accused based on a hunch until we reach a point where the plausible and the tenuous become blurred and we are never entirely sure what is true and what is mere paranoia. In some ways, the structure and scope of the film resembles Stone's ""JFK"" (though obviously less polemical) throwing lots of theories at the screen but not conforming to a single one.Visually, the film is stunning, evoking not only an effective representation of a particular place in a particular time ('70s San Francisco) but also many of the classic thrillers of this period such as ""Klute"", ""All the President's Men"" and, particularly, ""Dirty Harry"", a film that was inspired by the Zodiac killings and one which is explicitly referenced in one scene. There is also a certain amount of realism to the proceedings, murders as likely to happen at a daylight picnic on a beautiful day as in the more traditional locale of lovers' lane, and as much attention is paid to police bureaucracy and the personal and social lives of the characters as to the murder case.In a way, the focus is taken away from the killer, who is almost a faceless quasi-mythological figure, and placed upon those hunting him instead, and it is a testament to the talents of the cast that characters which could easily become clichéd archetypes (the obsessive amateur, the alcoholic but brilliant writer, the dogged cops) are genuinely believable, complex, well-rounded figures who are flawed yet genuinely sympathetic.I must stress that this is a film that really requires concentration and probably more than one viewing to appreciate the complexity of the central case. If you're friends or family talk through films, don't watch it with them, otherwise you'll miss stuff and won't know what the hell is going on/who people are etc. However, though the film is complex it is certainly rewarding and, while the fact that whatever theory the protagonist grasps crumbles may seem frustrating, it is in actuality enthralling, and Fincher's film is ultimately one that is as much about obsession as it is the mystery itself.Forget the tedious, suspense-less ""Panic Room"", ""Zodiac"" is Fincher right back on form.",Zodiac
464,TermlnatriX,David Fincher stamp all over,8,3 March 2007,"The movie was just great, don't go in expecting Se7en part 2, because it's not. This movie is a lot more upbeat, with comedic elements but still retaining the trademark Fincher atmosphere. The Thomson Viper does wonders for this film to capture the light in the night scenes and sets the atmosphere perfectly. One thing you will notice is innovative Fincher camera techniques/movements in the film that begin in mere seconds of the film's beginning. (That POV shot out of the car's window had me grinning, and turning to my friend) The movie IS long, 2 hours and 40 minutes - but it's SO involving that you don't really care about the time. It's like with King Kong remake, the time flies by pretty much. Unless you're extremely uninterested.The Transamerica Pyramid being constructed in time-lapse was the highlight moment for me because Fincher managed to sneak in his trademark style that he had previously showed in the Hewlett-Packard commercial. That had me grinning because it looked so cool not to mention the concept of time flying by instead of just using transition effects and some title cards saying ""XX months/years later"" Very unique.Also a very suspenseful scene down in the basement! Zodiac has Oscar nominations coming to it. I definitely see Robert Downey Jr. for Supporting actor, some technical awards, editing, DP, maybe even Director I love how this film has an epic feel to it, spanning the entire Zodiac timeline, and going even up to early 90's - how great is that. I grinned when I saw 1991.It's been too long for Fincher, hopefully no more 5 year breaks. Next is Benjamin Button.Any TRUE Fincher fan is going to love this film.",Zodiac
465,schism101,excellent study of the obsession of solving a crime,9,31 May 2007,"ZODIAC is a return to form for David Fincher, and is a superb and interesting study of the facts and the characters involved in the hunt for the zodiac killer who terroised San Fransisco, from the late 60's into the 70's. Rather than being a straightforward and sensational thriller, this film relies or is rather more focused and interested in the people involved in solving the crime, looking at how the case becomes an obsession to them yet affects there lives both at work and at home. Robert Graysmith (Jake Gylenhaal) whose book is the source material for this film, is a cartoonist for the San Fransisco Chronicle who along with Paul Avery (Robert Downey Jr) becomes obsessed with solving zodiac's cryptic coded messages. They come into contact over the course of the film with the officer in charge, Inspector David Toschi (Mark Ruffalo), who also becomes increasingly obsessed with solving the case. All three men feel the brunt and effects that this case has on them. Avery becomes increasingly drink and drug addled, Toschi's career slowly goes downhill, and Graysmith, though he comes out with a book published on the case, pushes his marriage and domestic life close to breaking point. Fincher handles the film very well, neither going for flashy or stylish camera-work, as shown in his last two films PANIC ROOM and FIGHT CLUB, yet rather approaching it in a subdued style, with the look and feel of the 70's perfectly re-created along with the look of the newspaper office, where most of the reporters are hard boiled and hard drinking hacks. There are some tense scenes, such as the killing by the lake, which is pretty unnerving and is disturbing in what it doesn't show, and also in another scene where Graysmith goes into the basement of a person who may or may not have some crucial evidence and realises there maybe someone else in the house upstairs and he maybe in the home of the killer. A superb film that reminded me of ALL THE PRESIDENTS MEN, in how it focus's on the investigation and carry's the feel of similar films from the seventies period of American cinema. Already one of the best films of the year and one I need to see again.",Zodiac
466,Filmfan-NL,Uninspiring,5,28 August 2007,"The dark, grungy atmosphere that works miracles for Se7en fails to hit the target in Zodiac. There's just a tad too much unsolved mystery, an unfinished story line too many. I believe the film tries to feed the viewer too much information. The detailed facts which make the book exciting reading material distracts and takes the pace out of the movie. Perhaps the film would have benefited from a asynchronous sequence. Basically I spent most of the time waiting for something to glue me to the screen and it just didn't come. The high rating probably has more to do with Fincher's name being attached to the movie than its cinematic merits. I wonder if I was the only one begging for some lights to be turned on in this too dark flick. (5/10)",Zodiac

So the acting is great, the filming is great, the story is good, all stories based on ""a true story"" always has that extra scary edge to it.But I'm sorry to say, it's far toooooo long, some people speak about the suspense, I want to ask them where the hell is it? The first few murders are thrilling, the last 15 mins of the movie are thrilling, but the ""in between"" is absolutely boring and not saved by the acting.We watched the movie with my wife not knowing anything about it, just picking it from the actors (that we like a lot) and the poster, well after the 1st hour I was starting to check my watch, 1h30 later we were starting to consider leaving the theatre but for not having checked the length of the movie, we stayed hoping for a swift deliverance, it only happened 45 mins later, after another 30 long minutes.So again, there is no denial about the quality of the story or the acting or even the outcome, but I will disagree with anyone speaking to me about suspense or even movie masterpiece.

There could be no arrest, no trial, no guns blazing, no dramatic confession. The movie would have to...well....just stop because they would have nothing else to say. So they would build up all the suspense and excitement and suddenly the credits would start rolling. And that's precisely what happened in the movie - talk about an anti-climax! Plus it's movies like this that seem to make the police look stupid. The lead detective spends virtually a decade on the case, makes little headway then a goofy looking cartoonist from the local newspaper comes along and neatly and quickly puts the case together. If it was so easy for him to do it, how could the police not do it earlier? Despite these drawbacks, this is still an excellent re-creation of the Zodiac murders and it makes you wonder if their prime suspect was really the Zodiac killer or if the real killer is still out there laughing at us all.",Zodiac
469,Dr_Kruger,"A good story, but it didn't really work for me",6,13 November 2008,"I've come to regard David Fincher as a dynamic filmmaker with slick fast moving films which keep you on the edge of your seat.I was expecting more of the same with Zodiac last night. I did get one of those qualities. It was certainly fast moving. It spent little time hanging around for us to absorb the vast amounts of evidence and facts that came with the case which led to it being less engaging for me. It dealt with the evidence in too much of a 'matter of fact' manner without concentrating on what it was supposed to do, which is entertain us. I also found that the large time jumps in the case where there were no letters from the Zodiac interrupted the flow of the film. In a well constructed film this should never happen.It's not all bad. It was an interesting story and certainly had it's tense moments. Perhaps being in America at the time would have helped. Again though, in a well made film this shouldn't matter. For me it erred too much on the style of 'documentary' and didn't have enough character development for me to enjoy it massively as a film. The first 20 minutes (before the huge evidence overload came into play) were exciting and I was thinking it was going to be great.Unfortunately it didn't keep it up. I suspect it would probably be more enjoyable on a second viewing now that I have got to grips with all the intricate parts of the case, but I just don't know if it's worth it, which is a shame. I wouldn't have associated this film with Fincher at all if I hadn't known",Zodiac
470,sukanya-samy,A mystery with so many ups and downs that your head spins,7,1 April 2016,"Zodiac is about the serial killings in the 1960's and 70's by a man who called himself Zodiac. Its based on Robert Greysmith's book of the same name. Robert was the official cartoonist at the San Francisco Chronicle around the time that the killings took place and later got obsessed with the case. The plot revolves around Paul Avery, the crime reporter at the newspaper and how he gets involved with the murders when Zodiac sends ciphers to prominent SF newspapers to get publicity. Robert is not taken seriously by his colleagues and though he proves his metal by solving the first cipher and coming up with real clues, he gets left behind as time goes by and Zodiac becomes more of an urban legend. Another central character is Dave Toschi who with his partner is in charge of investing into the murders from SFPD. Paul Avery and Dave Toschi come close to solving the murder but miss it by a shave because of some unforeseen circumstances. This is when Robert Greysmith takes it upon himself to solve it.Review – This movie could have been as great as Se7en or Fightclub but misses by a mile. The problems for me were the screenplay and the characters. Now I haven't read Robert's book but telling a story with a book is different. You can take up as much space as you want in a book and still make it interesting but its not the case with a movie. You only have that much time to enthrall the audience. The story itself pans over 20 odd years so to weave this in under 2 hours is a task by itself. The other weak link is Jake Gyllenhaal who plays Robert Greysmith. I believe he was chosen as his performance in Donnie Darko proved he could do both the naive and the obsessed sides pretty well and Roberts character in the film was the same. But Jake was the weakest link in the movie for me. His motivations were never made clear and his character development was patchy. He gets involved in the beginning, then is not and gets obsessed in the end. Robert Downey Jr. is great as this over-the- top-know-it-all reporter and so is Mark Ruffallo as inspector Toschi – no complaints here. The only bit that could have been done better was developing Robert Downey Jr.'s character better – one question I keep thinking about is why did he give up when he was so close solving the case?It is still a good watch as Fincher makes sure the story is tightly knit and the performances are good enough to keep you from getting up despite the fundamental problem in the story and the characters. Maybe the book will give me my answers. Anybody read it?",Zodiac
471,bscrivener-50810,"Mysterious and intriguing, but misguided and drawn out at times.",7,16 January 2016,"Zodiac is a 2007 thriller/drama film directed by David Fincher, which brings the true story of the Zodiac Killer to the big screen, who killed between 5+ people in and around the Bay Area during the late 1960's and early 1970's. Zodiac stars Jake Gyllenhaal as Paul Graysmith, a cartoonist who becomes obsessed with solving the case, Robert Downey Jr. as Paul Avery, a journalist and Mark Ruffalo as Dave Toschi, a detective in charge of the case. Zodiac's premise and grisly portrayal of the murders are certainly where it shines, along with the terrific acting of its cast and intriguing, mysterious atmosphere which leads us guessing and wondering at every turn. Zodiac pulls us into the film as an audience and like Gyllenhaal we often at times feel obsessed with the case and demand answers. However, the film does seem to over do its welcome especially with the run time at 2hours and 37minutes, towards the second half of the film and into the third act, the lack of action scenes can make it feel tiresome, despite Gyllenhaal's and Ruffalo's astounding performances barely holding it together. Some scenes feels unnecessary and drawn out. The film does whoever tremendously capture the barbarity, atmosphere and attention-craving nature of the unidentified Zodiac Killer, although not shining enough focus on him. Zodiac also seems to miss out portrayals of one or two murders which were possibly linked to the killer, this certainly would have helped boost the action in the latter part of the film. Overall, Zodiac captures the realism and ambiguity of the murders and keeps us questioning who and why in almost every scene, the development of the case just about keeps our attention and keeps us around for the conclusion, but at an expense of action sequences and more focus on the killer himself, despite A class acting from Gyllenhaal, Downey Jr. and Ruffalo. 7/10",Zodiac

It was successfully done, as the audience gets more and more absorbed in his pursuit instead of the crime itself.
The plot is well made, throwing at the audience incessant thrills. The series of ""catch and release"" is really effective, getting us so much hopeful only to dismiss the suspects as not guilty. The audience is left frustrated, curious, and lost, just as what Robert Graysmith is going through.
The scene with the poster writer is common heralded as the best scene, and I too share this view. The acting and cinematography are so excellent the tension is almost unbearable. The character sees the danger, and I the watcher feels it too, with no less fear and desperation and relief.
The only problem of Zodiac is that as it conforms to the integrity of the story, the movie drags at times.",Zodiac
473,ipekmine,Definitely recommendable for those interested in the genre,6,18 June 2012,"Zodiac is a typical David Fincher movie, a good crime drama based on real events with enough tension to include the film in the thriller category as well. The cast is well chosen and everyone's performance is equally great, leading to an overall good quality in terms of acting. One may argue that the film's a bit longer than it should have been, which I agree, but it still isn't boring, because the questions add up and tension grows, so you don't really notice how much time's passed. At different time points you may end up suspecting different characters to be involved in the Zodiac killings, and this certainly makes it a better movie, and makes you want to watch till the end and find out what actually is happening and who's done what. The ending is my least favorite part, not satisfactory enough, but it seems there's not much to do about it as the ending is also based on real events. Obviously, real life isn't as interesting as movie world. All in all, for those who like these kind of movies, Zodiac is highly recommendable. For instance, those who liked Fincher's Se7en would most probably enjoy this film as well.",Zodiac
474,jcdugger,An intricate mystery from the mind of David Fincher!...,9,30 April 2009,"Let's just go ahead and say it...Zodiac (2007) is the most intricate movie ever to appear on the silver screen! It certainly isn't the most thrilling or exciting movie ever made, but it has to be considered one of the most elaborate and detailed films ever to be created.In terms of re-watch-ability, on a scale of one to ten, Zodiac gets about a two-hundred-fifty! I've watched this movie in full about eight times and I watched portions of it at least another dozen times (the movie is replayed on TMC ad-nausea...and for some reason, I always flip it on...it's addicting!). And can you believe this...even for scenes that I've watched at least 20 times, I STILL sometimes pick up something I missed or didn't consider previously. You could seriously study this movie and come up with a different view-point every time (not about the killer, but rather the characters portrayed in the film).I gave this movie a 10 out of 10, although I admit it will turn off quite a few people. It is slow (purposely, as the Zodiac is a very detailed case). For the first viewing, you really need to be ""into it"". If your attitude is ""I'm just going to turn my mind off and watch a Mystery for 2 hours"", this probably wouldn't be the movie to throw in the DVD player. But if you're truly in the mood to get immersed in a detailed movie, this would at the top of my list of recommendations.Just to give an off-the-wall example of how detailed it is, I'll tell you the story of what I noticed last night for the first time (again, on about my 20th viewing). The main character, Jake Gyllenhaal as Robert Graysmith, eats or munches on something (usually carrots, as they try to portray him a nerd) on a few separate occasions early in the movie when he is first hearing about Zodiac (btw, the eating has nothing to do with anything in the plot). As he becomes more obsessed in the Zodiac story, you don't see him eat anymore. Then very late in the movie, when Robert's life is completely and utterly immersed in Zodiac and Zodiac only, his now-separated wife quickly mentions ""When's the last time you ate?"", and you as a viewer never think of anything of it (as they continue the conversation). As a viewer, I challenge anybody to notice something like that, something that intricate, on the first viewing. Now take that above story and multiply it by about 1000 for all the different intricacies, and you will finally begin to sense the scope and detail of this movie. I am beginning to think the entire movie, every single scene, is filled with minor details like that...as it never runs out of those types of things upon re-watches.Although this is a MUCH different movie that the spectacular ""Fight Club"", Zodiac will be considered as one of David Fincher's best works ever. Great job Mr. Fincher, my many compliments! JD",Zodiac
475,mchinni-42999,Speechless,9,14 July 2018,"I was lost in the movie, as long as it was playing, empathizing with all these characters, and having to keep reminding myself throughout that this really happened. In movies, generally, when something happens that hurts to watch, you can take the comfort of thinking that it is not real(my mom reminds when we're watching a movie together and i react to it strongly, which is often the case). The most sad part is the amount of their lives that these people would have spent in searching for him, in fear of their lives, giving up their comfortable state of existence? Just to come up empty? And after finally pinpointing him, after many years, to not be able to do anything about it? paul avery is the one real life character is grieve the most for. At any rate, this is a story of a few brave men who refused to give up in the face of ambiguity and emptiness, and still persevered anyway, always keeping their head in the job. For that, they have my utmost respect, whatever the result of that may or may not have been. This is one movie that you must watch that realistically portrays the story, is a well crafted work of art, and teaches you just what a good, hard-working american man is capable of doing if he just has a library to back him up!",Zodiac
476,warvignesh16,Such a cliffhanger,7,6 December 2019,"This is the only one of David Fincher's films that end with a cliffhanger. Towards the last 55 minutes of the film, I was under the impression that the cartoonist turned amateur sleuth was onto the killer and is about to unmask the killer Zodiac, and as it turns out it's an unsolvable case.It did occur to my thought was the Zodiac killer just one bloke or was it some clique using it to slaughter people. The cab driver was the first killing of the Zodiac killer that doesn't involve a couple... which lead the two group of men to believe that he was trying to break his patterns.
You drunken reprobate.",Zodiac

The local newspaper reviewer gave it a rave review, so I decided to give it a whirl. While I don't think it's by any means a crappy movie, I don't see what those who rated it a ""10"" did.There's something about Gyllendal (sp?): he's a good actor, but he never got me to really *care* about his obsession. Same with Ruffalo: good actor; why don't I feel *along with* him?Then again, maybe I saw it on a night that any movie would have left me mostly high and dry.Robert Downey Jr. does terrific work, as usual.

478,miked-26800,Confusing and overlong,6,27 June 2021,"Based on a true unsolved serial killer murder case, the film had some chilling moments and some well handled scenes but overall was confusing and disappointing. As the investigation progressed it was often not made clear where this or that lead had come from and the often unclear dialogue did not help in this regard. Why is it often the case with modern films that the dialogue is unclear whereas in the films of say the 1940's every word can be heard? The ending implied that the case had been solved but actually the case is still unsolved.",Zodiac
479,dannyloeper,Zodiac - Invested from the start,9,3 March 2020,"I've been trying to go back and watch more films made in the 2000's, as I have missed a lot of good ones and just need to take a break from modern cinema. I think it's safe to say that my favorite genre is thriller/mystery films, as I feel like I am more a part of the movie than any other genre. I was beyond invested into Zodiac, from it being a true story, to the eeriness and suspense throughout its course. Being that this is a true story, I tend to rate it in a different way, as what we are seeing is based on true facts. I tend to pay more attention to the overall acting and chemistry between the castThe cast is stacked for this film, and they all deliver compelling performances. I never dove to much into the story of the Zodiac killer, but I've heard that the movie does a great job of presenting facts and actual details of the crimes committed. I have also heard that there is a whole other world of knowledge on the crimes, and I intend to investigate and learn even more as the movie was beyond interesting for me! I felt so invested in this movie from the very start and feel that everyone should watch it.This film focuses on the Zodiac killer, a serial killer that would kill his victims and proceed to taunt the media by sending notes to the press containing his confession, as well as cryptic clues to let them know he is truly the one who committed the killings. Jake Gyllenhaal plays Robert Graysmith, a comic artist with a serious obsession with puzzles. He takes it upon himself to try and ""unmask"" who the killer really is, and the whole movie documents his strategies and determination to solve this. 2 of the other main stars include RDJ playing Paul Avery, a writer for the post, and Mark Ruffalo (one of my favorite actors of all time) playing Dave Toschi, the main investigator on the case.The main chunk of this film focuses on Graysmith being determined to unravel the different killings that happen, and connect the pieces, much like a puzzle. Toschi loses hope of ever finding out who the killer really is, as do many others, but Toschi comes around to a final proposal of the killer near the end of the film, but to this day, the killer was never 100% identified. I feel like I can't do to much more analysis until I read more about the case, but from a movie standpoint, I was never not watching and recommend to any film junkie!!",Zodiac
480,diffguy,"Frustrating, Yet Worth It",8,23 November 2019,"This film is a perfect example of powerhouse actors elevating a screenplay beyond its mediocre potential. The script was extremely dry with (probably) literal quotes from the real-life detectives, and comedic notes that were attempted hit offbeat. The immensely talented cast was able to make this much more than it would have been.The plot meanders from character to character without any apparent purpose for switching the point of view. It became extremely frustrating. For a good portion of the film, the viewer isn't even certain who the main character is, due to the constant switching between RDJ, Gyllenhall, Mark Ruffalo, and even Anthony Edwards to an extent. By about the two hour mark, the viewer is left wondering if there was any reason to include the point of view of those characters at all. I am only able to attribute this weakness to an attempt to be faithful to the source material of Zodiac, Fincher making certain he hit each event in the timeline to make Robert Graysmith's case coherent.But.There are two scenes that are peak fucking Fincher.Much like the near-end of Girl with the Dragon Tattoo when Mikael Blomkvist confronts (villain), Fincher creates the same pillow-clenching, breathless tension for Robert Graysmith with another suspect. I was literally on the edge of my seat holding two pillows to my chest. On top of that, the other gripping scene occurs halfway through when Mark Ruffalo and two other detectives are interviewing Arthur Leigh Allen. Fincher shot the scene of the four men from about 8 different camera angles as Allen recounts persuasive reasons for why the evidence against him can be explained away.Lastly, the final 40 minutes of the film makes up for the shortcomings of the first two acts. Not coincidentally, this is the only portion of the film that maintains a constant point of view without switching. And it has one of the two peak-Fincher scenes.",Zodiac
481,rcbbo,The Latest From the Greatest (Fincher),8,6 April 2007,"David Fincher is a directing God. Se7en, Fight Club, The Game and Panic Room are all really good movies.His directorial return to the big screen for the first time in 5 years had me more than a little excited as he decided to take on the Zodiac killings from San Francisco in the late 60s to early 70s.Zodiac chronicles the story of an seemingly random killer who terrorized the city of San Francisco for years. After committing his second murder in 8 months, the Zodiac killer contacts three newspapers in the area and orders them to print a cipher on the front page of the newspaper or he will continue to terrorize the area.Columnist Paul Avery (Robert Downey Jr.) and cartoonist Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal) both immediately become engrossed in the case. For Avery, it's his job. For Graysmith, it becomes a passion.Inspectors David Toschi and William Armstrong are two who follow the case very closely and go through several interviews to try and pin the Zodiac killer.Over the next 2h40m we see the grisly murders of The Zodiac and the investigators failed attempts to track him down. It gets to the point where he is toying with columnists, investigators and the general public.For the first half of the movie, we are fully in the grasp of David Fincher. He keeps you fully engaged in the movie. The second half begins to drag as the story begins to focus on Graysmith's attempt to bring down The Zodiac. Graysmith goes through the files and contacts three different people involved with the case on a regular basis to try and crack the case.The main problem with Zodiac is that the second half of the movie seems to do nothing except review all the info you got in the first half, only it does it all in a very slow fashion and with a lot less of that Fincher flair.The one thing that is consistently good about Zodiac, is Robert Downey Jr.. Downey is great in the movie from beginning to end.Overall, I'd say it's a good movie, but the second half could have been more interesting than Fincher made it.7/10",Zodiac
482,melinetto,it's a quality one but i'm not so pleased with it,7,19 May 2021,"Another narrative which is full of mystery from David Fincher. And just an another sleuthing flick after Seven. But unlike Seven, it is a slow-paced movie and i can say that i didn't get much a taste of it. Frankly, you wanted to know who this serial killer is but after passing some time and you know, after a certain point, i think, it doesn't matter anymore. Maybe, David Fincher wanted the audience to have some kind of this feeling. Or maybe, you know, very much likely lol, i'm the only one who's just feel this way...Robert Downey Jr. Who plays the character of Paul Avery who's just a troubled and alcoholic guy performs really well. And Jake Gyllenhaal, as you know and like always is so good in the role of Robert Graysmith who's a passionate, determined and tenacious cartoonist.David Fincher is one of my favorite directors and is in like my top 10 but Zodiac isn't amongst my fav movies, that's for sure.",Zodiac
483,za-andres,"""Zodiac"" is of the rarest-and dying-type of Hollywood thriller",9,12 March 2007,"Exhilarating, unshakable, mesmerizing, baffling, and adept beyond belief, David Fincher's Zodiac neither lacks ambition or audacity. Combining all aspects of Fincher's works from his cynical Se7en to his brilliant Fight Club, Zodiac is of the rarest --and dying-- kind of Hollywood thrillers, both simplistically alive and meticulously astute.Shot on state-of-the-art HD by Harris Savides via a process that required absolutely no celluloid or tape, Zodiac gives off somewhat of a rich, smoky feel, often felt as if it were shot with a Mini DV. This also gives a feel of realism towards a film that is not supposed to be interpreted that way at all. Such a toned-down aesthetic (full of fades to black) is matched by David Shire's taut score and the director's conspicuously reserved camera work, which favors both masterful crane-shots and visual close-ups giving the audience it's grab towards emotion.Although Zodiac looks like the average, done-deal, it truly isn't. Mixed with stunning casting (especially Ruffalo, who finally proves himself), a beautiful chronology that never seems to slog the film's pace, and a feeling of overall realism, Zodiac really is a director at the top of his game. The film is in its own world, unique in its own ways, but also glares a sense of naturalism. Zodiac embeddes the beauty of itself in our minds, creating a stark, unforgettable journey that truly must be seen to be believed.",Zodiac
484,Hollywoodrulez,Stick that in your pipe and smoke it,9,7 August 2010,I really like how the story follows a cartoonist who decides his going to prove himself to people that he can do more then draw cartoons. To all people who think that your prone to only being what you can I'd just like to say your wrong. Watch this film it is a true underdog story he might not solve the case but he comes damn close. Jake is once again brilliant in the role. After brokeback everyone kind of thought his to much of a soft guy to play any phiyiscal or tough guy type roles. Well they were wrong again. All round the film is true to the actual events and is well reasearched and presented. The way that David had it looking and feeling like it was the 60's again was also executed nicely.,Zodiac

Nothing more. Lot of local street names, person names, slangs and other localized stuffs makes it a pain to watch.

But since then I've seen this film several times. With each re-viewing it gets better and better. Some highlights:1. Fincher does a terrific job portraying a US city in the late 1960's and 1970's. For anyone who was an adult back then, this film is something of a trip down memory lane.2. The soundtrack is great, and perfectly suited to the plot, especially a Hollywood studio band's rendition of Santana's ""Soul Sacrifice"".3. All the performances are great. This film was perfectly cast, and the three main actors are perfect in their roles.4. The film moves along at a fairly good pace.My only dislike of this film involves its violence.

489,MarkCrozier,Darkness visible,9,7 October 2009,"The final instalment in Fincher's epic dark trilogy showing the decline and fall of civilisation that began with Se7en differs in that it is not a work of fiction but is based on the true life events surrounding the Zodiac killer, who hunted his victims in and around San Francisco throughout the 70s.The movie opens in 1969 on the 4th of July with a stunning panoramic shot of fireworks over the city - an unforgettable image. Fincher's movie is based largely on the book by Robert Graysmith, a cartoonist at the San Francisco Chronicle who became obsessed with the case and ended up writing a book about it.Zodiac does a fantastic job of conveying the frustrating and exhaustive nature of the investigation, which spans almost two decades during the course of the film and remains open to this day.Unlike the fantasy world of TV shows like CSI, many cases of this nature are never solved or may take decades to close.Fincher takes us on this journey and we watch as the principle players in the Zodiac drama are forever altered by the case.The players are uniformly superb, in particular Jake Gyllenhal as Graysmith and Robert Downey Jr as Paul Avery, the crime reporter who covers the Zodiac case for the Chronicle.John Carroll Lynch gives an amazing portrayal of Robert Leigh Allen, the man Graysmith believes to be the killer.Art production to deliver a convincing 70s San Francisco is of the highest standard and the film is beautifully shot (look out for the recurring blue and yellow themes).Zodiac shows Fincher at the height of his considerable powers as a visual stylist and story-teller.",Zodiac
490,Kroshe,Not Fincher's one of the best..,6,29 October 2009,"Zodiac is a moderately interesting but overly long film about a serial killer's reign of fear in the San Francisco area in the late sixties. The length of this film is I guess in keeping with the longevity of the police investigation into the case. I didn't find it to be a particularly gripping or absorbing film and it is hardly a thriller either, but it does ""just"" enough to keep the viewer from switching off. It's a dramatisation of a true story and you can see where the cinematic bits have been slotted in to try and make a film out of it. However, despite its clunky moments of crass direction the story in itself is quite interesting and the film is made watchable by a very enjoyable performances from Robert Downey Jr. and Anthony Edwards.If you're expecting an action packed thriller which keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout, then you'll be disappointed. So if you're after an adrenaline rush, look elsewhere. Otherwise it is not a bad movie although it doesn't fulfill my expectations for a David Fincher film.",Zodiac

We get to see a lot of really fine actors and amazing actresses do what they're good at, but this is like watching a repeat of a story we all know too well (even if we don't, because we could make this one up ourselves!). You'll be watching this wondering how much it has cost, and why they wasted it on such a thin story.I did not have a problem with the duration, it was all done very well; the scenery, the sets, the sixties, seventies, eighties were all portrayed like only these guys can, and it's nice to see these actors perform so well, but it doesn't extend from that. I had a similar feeling after The Departed. Something too artificial and forced about it all. It just doesn't get to you as much as it's supposed to.Some movies I'd recommend instead, somewhat neglected, but actually more worth your time: ""Wolf Creek"", ""The Matador"", ""Blood Diamond"", heck, I'm sorry for those involved, but even ""Vacancy"" and ""Hot Fuzz"" were more exciting to watch than Zodiac. Or, if you can, please see the TV-series ""Dexter"". It blows away a movie like this in all aspects. Or even a series like ""24"". After seeing those, a cheap story-line like the one in Zodiac, completely pales in comparison.It then comes as no surprise that the high rating on IMDb is not appropriate. This shall go down in time, no doubt, as it doesn't belong in the Top 250. It honestly isn't worth more than a 6.2 rating here; The story seems to have no moral to it, it comes across as useless, the scenario is often too difficult, slow and uninteresting, and I blame those who created it for pretending not to know or see this. I'm certain they knew what they were filming wasn't very interesting. People get killed everywhere, under fascinating circumstances, and this is what you come up with?

493,davulture,A Very Haunting Movie about the Infamous Zodiac Killer rampaging San Francisco,9,16 August 2007,"Zodiac was probably one of the most interesting movies I've seen of 2007. Granted I've been watching mostly three-quels and missing the compelling fix of an original story, Zodiac passed the radar until I recently checked it out. The story focuses on a Mysterious Zodiac Murderer rampaging San Francisco between 1969-1978 and the story of how a cartoonist named Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal) an Reporter named Paul Avery (Robert Downey Jr) a Detective Dove Toschi (Mark Ruffalo) and his partner Bill Armstrong (Anthony Edwards). The movie is very interesting and never gives a particular identification on who the Zodiac killer actually is and the peak of the movie is when the story starts to shift away from Downey and Gyllenhaal and instead focus on Ruffalo and Edward's character and when they finally target down a suspect named Arthur Leigh Allen played masterfully by John Carroll Lynch. The movie weaves through a maze and shows how this Zodiac case effects all the lives of the individuals involved in it. Although the movie is probably one of the best of 2007 I do feel that after Downey Jr and Edwards left the movie in the beginning of the 3rd Act toward the finale, the movie lacked the energy that drove it toward the beginning and began to sag a little bit. Though still the movies and it's performances from everybody including Bryan Cox and Donal Logue max this a very well acted and interesting movie that leaves chills up to your spines up until the final scene.

There is no problem with the acting, it was good enough. If I am going to talk about colors and places of the movie, I will say it was not that good. Colors of the movie was so classic style, it was not shiny. Places were not that much, film was going on mostly at indoor (offices, houses).

The remaining 5% would be, I'd say, the first quarter of the film in which murder scenes take place. Thereafter, it very quickly loses its tract, intrigue and any initial appeal it gained and is very hard to watch through to the end.There is no meaningful ending to the film (surprise) and you are simply left with a few cuts of text explaining what happened to people after the nothing happened, almost as though the film-makers themselves got bored with the storyline and stopped bothering.Overall a poor piece of work that, much to my amazement, has received unjustifiably good ratings.

DIRECTED BY: David FINCHER ~ THE RUNDOWN: David Fincher better watch his a** because if the never-captured Zodiac Killer is still around, the guy might decide to slip his hood on one last time and enact revenge for this frighteningly paced catastrophe. ~ Well the Zodiac STILL hasn't had a good movie made about him, and with a case as horrifying and extremely intriguing as his - I'd be plain pis*ed off! I mean, wow, the guy went around in an executioner's outfit stabbing people in broad daylight, as well as totally messing with the San Francisco police department for years...yet, so far, every movie about the guy has just sucked, including this one, and I truly am disappointed because David Fincher is a brilliant filmmaker and his take on the Zodiac killings looked so promising. Yet, this movie, by no means, delivered and only makes the true events unappealing. The pacing was horrible and the screenplay was muddled and jumpy with no sense of where it wanted to go or how it wanted to present what happened. Now, I know it's based on a book, but I guess the book must suck too. Also, the Jake Gyellhaal/Reporter aspect of the story was boring, clichéd and basically the same thing as that straight-to-video Zodiac movie made recently with Rory Culkin in it. Everything about the film was completely expected with little to no innovation and I'm sorry to say Fincher, but your energies were completely wasted. And, what the hell was up with all the subtitles? They were definitely unnecessary every two minutes. ~ The movie was two and a half hours in length but seemed more like three and a half. Looking back on the film, most of the good stuff was foolishly jammed into the first hour or less and the rest of the film comes across as a tedious, incomprehensible cycle of Gyllenhaal running around getting information about the guy with little suspense and entertainment value. This is a problem because no one wants to sit there and listen to long strands of information read to them. That just plain sucks. It's true there was some genuinely funny dark humor, but not enough to compensate for its problems, and, anyways, this isn't a comedy and shouldn't be awarded points for a little cheap humor, despite the fact it was indeed tasty and very brilliant at times when Fincher somehow managed to showcase just a little of his brilliance here and find a middle ground between horror and dark humor.

499,AverxgeJoe,True stories are not always good on film,7,10 December 2014,"Yeah so the film is about the mass murderer called the Zodiac Killer and the manhunt for him. He kills innocent people and the authorities are trying to find him of course. The film is a true story. It follows closely the real events and the characters are real as well.That's one of the main problems with it. The film is far too long and slow. There is not much excitement apart from couple of scenes. But in those scenes you already know the outcome because this is true story. That's the problem with films following true stories very closely and not embellishing the story to fit it better in a film. I wasn't keen on the cinematography neither. The film is about a dark topic but that doesn't really reflect from the film. The setting is always bright and almost happy even.When watching this film it didn't feel like I was watching a feature film, but more like a documentary. Because honestly this is how it feels. And who would be interested in watching a documentary that runs 2 hours and 45 minutes. As sometimes in the film, the characters lose faith in finding the Zodiac Killer, I myself lost faith in having interest in the movie.So the film was too long and dull, but there was some quality acting. Performances were good all around and there is nothing bad to say about Fincher's directing. So the film wasn't bad but it wasn't great neither. Something between.",Zodiac

501,Wolf30x,"Good, but not what you'd expect",8,2 March 2007,"Usually when a film gets made about a media grabbing unsolved crime, the resulting movie tends to be overtly sensational and at best remotely connected to what really happened. Considering that director David Fincher's last film about a serial killer was the gripping but deeply disturbing Se7en, his take on the Zodiac killer almost seemed primed to be an extreme, nail-biting thriller.Instead what he's given us is a well argued thesis on the possible identity of the Zodiac. While there are some very intense scenes, Fincher takes a somewhat unexpected approach on the subject. All of the killings take place pretty early on in the movie, with the bulk of the story centering on the actual investigation into the killer by both the cops and a cartoonist who becomes obsessed with the case. In fact, the depictions of the murders are done in a manner that is fairly reverent towards the victims while still conveying the cruelty of them.Some people may find themselves disappointed by this two and a half hour epic if they go in expecting the usual serial killer fare. But it's a must see for any fan of Fincher's work, or anybody who likes a good detective story.",Zodiac
502,emeeme2003,"""There's more than one way to lose your life to a killer.""",9,22 February 2021,"The grainy crackle of two vintage, late 60's studio logos set the retro-stage, before the soothing sounds of Three Dog Night's ""Easy To Be Hard"" begins to play against the spectacular sight of the San Francisco skyline on the 4th Of July, 1969, as the fireworks illuminate the looming silhouette of the Golden Gate Bridge, and a young surburban couple head out on an impromptu date to their local lover's lane, creating a seemingly perfect portrait of vintage, picket-fenced Americana.However, this picture is soon shattered by the glare of another car's headlights idling menacingly behind them, before that glare is replaced by that of a flashlight as an unseen assailant gets out and approaches them, the light piercing through the darkness as a relentless stream of bullets from a gun similarly pierces the victims, their blood splattering all over the car in a sickening slow motion. Moments later, as a patrolman responds to this horrific scene, we hear an eerie male voice call the local 911 and say ""I wanna report a murder. No... a double murder. If you go one mile east on Columbus Parkway, to a public park, you'll find kids in a brown car. They were shot with a 9mm Luger. I also killed those kids last year. Good... bye"", before he abruptly hangs up, ending the call just as suddenly as he did the lives of his victims.This is the opening scene of David Fincher's Zodiac, a perfectly jarring introduction to this bloody chapter of Northern California history, in a film that's a superb addition to the serial killer/procedural sub-genre, and one of the best films of the 2000's, as well as the iconic auteur's best work to date, as far as I'm concerned.Obviously, it tells the true story of the titular serial killer who terrorizied the Bay Area with a string of grisly shootings & stabbings back in the 60's, but, while Zodiac certainly isn't the first serial killer procedural ever made, it's the particular way that Fincher tells this tale that makes it special, as he juggles a multitude of story threads and perspectives throughout the tangled case, going back and forth between the police investigation, various minor characters, and the journalists of The San Francisco Chronicle, who share an unusually close relationship to the killer, as he periodically pens multiple taunting letters to the paper, manipulating them like puppets to feed his own appetite for mass media attention, with this aspect sort of making Zodiac feel like if the newsroom scenes in All The President's Men were occasionally interspersed with scenes of grimly horrifying murders, the omnipresent ringing of rotary phones in the background giving way to the piercing sounds of the victims' screams.But despite these grisly setpieces, Zodiac isn't a work of crass exploitation, but a sharp, methodical procedural at its core, as Fincher takes the same basic subject matter of his breakthrough (if somewhat overrated) work Se7en, and directs it in a less sensationalized, more mature manner, as he knows exactly when to get ""flashy"" with his style here (like a spectacular overhead tracking shot from the heavens of a taxi weaving its way through the San Fran streets), and when to hang back and just let the story speak for itself, as the propulsive pacing, sudden timeline jumps, and rapid-fire bursts of exposition of the first half give way to Robert Graysmith's under the table, one-man investigation in the second.Jake Gyllenhaal puts in a perfectly-cast performance as the hopelessly bookish, perpetually unrespected cartoonist, who goes from being an often-dismissed bystander that occasionally contributes a tiny bit to the case, to the only person keeping the hunt for the Zodiac alive, which contrasts nicely with the fall of crime reporter Paul Avery (also perfectly played by Robert Downey Jr., in a somewhat autobiographical role), the man who seems like he should be the ""star"" of the case, until his various self-destructive tendencies prove to be his downfall, even as he's imbued with plenty of quippy, rock star charisma courtesy of RDJ, to the point that it's baffling to think there was ever a time when he wasn't one of the world's biggest movie stars.However, the film's focus in its 2nd half smartly remains on Graysmith and his futile, seemingly endless journey into a (sometimes literal) underworld of endless, labyrinthine deadends, and even when Graysmith does seem to make progress, his marriage is still crumbling underneath the crushing weight of his Quixotic obsession with the case, which hits home even closer than before when it seems as though the anonymous killer has begun targeting Graysmith himself with a series of unnerving calls to his home, the same one where his wife and children live, unaware of the threat he has invited into their midst.However, even when those calls come to a suspiciously convenient end with the death of the primary suspect in the case, his death still not only robs us of a sense of justice, as he dies of a heart attack before he could be arrested, but we also learn that his DNA was a mismatch for the real killer's, robbing us even of a sense of finality, as we're left with the sobering, haunting possibility at the end of the film that the ""Hurdy Gurdy Man"" could still be out there, just waiting to sing his songs of murder again someday, somewhere.",Zodiac

Well, it's a crime movie with David Fincher in the director's chair. Now, just for the record we've seen 'Seven' and 'Fight Club' and it is really his style of direction that is 'intrigue' in nature. Same goes for this movie. Zodiac is a real big puzzle and to understand it, attention has to be given to all the details of characters, incidents, dates, written letters and ciphers to name a few.The movie is an adaptation of a book by Robert Graysmith (The character is played by Jake Gyllenhaal). The direction is top-notch so is the screenplay by James Vanderbilt and the Editing by Angus Wall.In terms of acting Gyllenhaal who plays a cartoonist but due to his curios nature (read the character), it takes him to extreme highs towards solving the case, and he does a fine job. He fits the bill perfectly. Robert Downey Jr. has a small part to play but does the job good. The surprise for me came in the form of Mark Ruffalo who plays the role of Inspector Dave Toschi. His angst, nature, curiosity all is reflected continuously. His body language, wee-bit of arrogance all other qualities which according to me he has grasped for the sake of the character has to be applauded. The rest of the cast supports the flow of the movie well.The length of the movie is questionable. For the viewer it gets draggy at some point (From my own experience).Special mention for the Production design and of course the cinematography. It really gives the feel of the 70's. I have seen the Dirty Harry series so I can tell that!!!In a Nutshell:a) Highlights: Great crime story, fine direction, acting is enjoyable. b) Flaws: The length of the movie, Too many things to digest in one go. c) USP : The mystery quotient remains high till the end.

Instead, I found myself mind-numbingly bored for two and a half hours.""Zodiac"" should have been an exciting tale of a cat-and-mouse game between a murderer and those out to catch him. At the very least, it should have been a fascinating psychological portrait of what makes a killer tick -- or, for that matter, what drives the police and the reporters on his trail.""Zodiac"" unfortunately fails on both scores. It plods when it should race, does not engage our emotions, and does not provide compelling motives for the Zodiac or for those pursuing him. (The victims are appallingly disposable. We are given no incentive to care about them at all.) Indeed, the ""evidence"" presented by the film did not convince me of the main suspect's guilt. For instance, why does the killer adopt a different modus operandi for each murder? (We are told that the Zodiac took credit for crimes he did not commit. Possible, but not very persuasive.) ""Zodiac"" works best as an exploration of Robert Graysmith's obsession with the case, to the point of risking his marriage to bring the killer to justice. But, even here, despite Jake Gyllenhaal's stellar performance, the film does not quite succeed.""Zodiac"" has a great soundtrack of hits from the late 1960s and 1970s, and it wonderfully captures the look of that plaid-and-polyester period. (Gracious, did we really wear such ugly clothes?) There is one slip-up on the screenwriter's part. The suspected killer is referred to as possibly being a pedophile. I'm pretty certain that term did not come into common usage until after the mid-1980s. In the late 1960s and 1970s, we would have called him a child molester. (More to the point, however, why would a pedophile target adults rather than children?) I read one review that called ""Zodiac"" a police procedural. For me, however, it felt more like an epidural. Despite a constellation of acting talent, the stars simply do not align.",Zodiac
505,xander34,10/10,10,4 March 2007,"Director David Fincher finally ends his five year hiatus with a new masterwork in his take on the Zodiac murder case. In Zodiac, Fincher still clings to his dark, thrilling roots, yet expands his horizons in presenting the majority of the film from the perspective of a newspaper room. Unlike his previous notable works, (Se7en, Fight Club, Panic Room) Fincher is not trying to be overly flaunting with the camera. Instead, he focuses on the details. From the opening vintage Universal and Warner Brothers logos to the pens Jake Gyllenhaal's character uses, we are completely thrown into the '60s-'70s time period that Zodiac predominantly encompasses.Zodiac's main theme seems to be precision. The camera is always in the right place and the performances by every actor is pitch perfect, without anyone being overly showy. There are a few artistic moments where Fincher departs from subtlety and awes us, such as showing a time lapse sequence of the creation of the Transamerica Tower. It's safe to say that Zodiac is the best looking film shot with digital technology thus far . The film is shot on the same High Definition camera as Collateral and Miami Vice, and unlike those films, the look is not unsettling or distracting at all.The film's meticulous obsession with detail also mirrors the characters and the story of the film itself. Throughout the film, we are introduced to four major characters who become obsessed with the Zodiac killer, one of whom ends up devoting all of his time to the case, neglecting his family in the process and potentially risking his life to identify the murderer. This character, Robert Graysmith, the writer of the book the film is based on, is played neurotically by Gyllenhaal. Robert Downey Jr. shows that he's still one of Hollywood's top actors in his dry, witty, self-destructive portrayal of reporter Paul Avery. Anthony Edwards plays William Armstrong, a detective partnered to Mark Ruffalo's David Toschi. Ruffalo fearlessly changed his voice and mannerisms to play Toschi, surprising many who have only seen him in romantic comedies.One complaint about Zodiac is that the film is too long. Yes, it is long, but it isn't boring at all. Every scene is packed with so much information and detail that it isn't surprising to hear that a previous cut of the film ran a half an hour longer. Some scenes are expository and somewhat slow, but these are necessary in order for the faster, edgier scenes to shine. The film's length is necessary to introduce the vast ensemble of characters, with performances by Brian Cox, Chloe Sevigny, and John Carroll Lynch being the most memorable. What is also remarkable is the epic feel of the film that trailers failed to show. We ultimately span from the late sixties to the mid eighties, as well as an additional scene in the nineties, closing out with an contemporary epilogue over Donovan's ominous Hurdy Gurdy Man.In Zodiac, Fincher did what so few have done. Under the cramped confines of a major studio, he ambitiously created a film both artistically satisfying and utterly entertaining.",Zodiac
506,psufan-64278,Fincher's most Underrated Film....maybe his best,10,7 November 2017,"This might be the most underrated crime-mystery ever made. It's truly saddening that it doesn't even score an 8/10. I partly think that is because many people went into this thinking their would be more ""action"". This movie is a slow-burn, and if you go in knowing that, I think you will enjoy it much more. This is probably my favorite Fincher movie (yes, over Fight Club and Se7en). These events really happened, and are accurately depicted from what we know about the the Zodiac murders and investigation. I think that many people are upset that most of the ""scary"" scenes are over in the first 30 minutes, but the whole movie is scary in my opinion. I understand why the Zodiac is not shown often, because nobody truly knows much about him. Its clear Fincher didn't want to show the Zodiac much, because making assumptions about his crimes would take away from the accuracy he is trying to depict. If you know anything about the Zodiac Killer, than you know what the end result is going to be (SPOLIER?: They never catch him). But the way the police and Robert Graysmith (Whose book the movie is based on) go about trying to piece together one of the most enigmatic criminals of all-time is so interesting to watch. This movie gets you to look more into the Zodiac Killer when you're done watching. As the movie is based off of Graysmith's accounts, it gets you to favorite a particular individual as being the Zodiac. However, further research into these killings shows that there is just as much evidence that exonerates this individual as there is that incriminates him. This film is one of the best crime/mysteries/psychological thrillers of all-time. I truly think it is Fincher's most underrated film and possibly his best. If you know anything about the Zodiac crimes you will love this film, and if you don't, you will become another one of the civilian detectives who are trying to crack this perplexing case.",Zodiac

508,fortionat1,A very entertaining story even if not based on real facts.,7,15 July 2011,"The movie Zodiac was quite entertaining and the actors used in this movie did an outstanding job, especially Mark Ruffalo playing inspector Tochi. I never got bored during the movie as it moved along nicely and left me thinking about who was the real killer Zodiac.The problem I have with this movie is that it says it is based on fact and many of the reviewers say they enjoyed the movie because it stuck to the facts. Unfortunately this is not true. I have no problem when a movie, as most do, takes commercial license to glamorize or make interesting a true or actual event. The problem here is that this film actually puts in known and glaring falsities that are the foundation for Graysmith's conclusion that Arthur Leigh Allen was the Zodiac.Most people who have not read into the facts or do so after the movie will come away with the glaring conclusion that Leigh was the killer based on damning evidence presented during the movie. However most of that evidence is not true. The most glaring falsity of the movie is that the call that was traced to Attorney Melvin Belli house came during January 1970 and that one call that the housekeeper got was traced to a mental hospital and the caller was ruled out. So Graysmith's obsession with the ""Dec 18"" call ""it's my birthday I have to kill"" call did not happen on Dec 18 and the call was traced. This glaring fact is completely overlooked in the movie. Now there are many other REAL facts that basically prove Leigh Allen was not the Zodiac killer and there are plenty of websites that offer facts and research from the actual police if one is interested in learning further.Again I think this movie was very entertaining and one of the better crime movies I have seen, yet for the misguided omission of the true facts. I would recommend this movie but keep an open mind and look a little deeper if you want the true facts and evidence accumulated over the years.",Zodiac
509,halohamish,It's a killer,8,5 October 2008,"""Zodiac"" starts ominously in small American town, Vallejo, 1969, where the likes of an unseen evil lurking in the shadows is almost unimaginable. This is, until, two lovers are gunned down by the man that would continue to haunt the hearts of all Americans for decades. This sets the scene for the rest of the film, which takes us on a dark and depraved journey through the 1960's where America was plagued by one of its most notorious serial killers, the Zodiac killer.""Zodiac"" is probably the closest a film has ever been to portraying the true effects of a serial killer on a society as a whole. While one man strides the streets, hundreds close their blinds, lock their doors and cry in fear. And this is what I believe ""Zodiac"" achieves in showing to the viewer, and in such a gritty and brutally honest way. This did happen, and Zodiac comes nothing short of showing how very real this time was and how it changed America's people forever. But one man that was probably effected more than anyone is that of Robert Graysmith, played by Jake Gyllenhaal (Donnie Darko, Brokeback Mountain). Graysmith is a cartoonist for the San Francisco Chronicle and one of many to experience Zodiac's terror first hand. Gyllenhaal really out does himself as Graysmith, showing how ""Zodiac"" is not only a film about a serial killer, but a film about one mans undying thirst for the truth, and how that continues to affect the entirety of his life. Gyllenhaal could have portrayed this no better and is showing how much a commendable actor he truly is. Other performances by Downey Jr. (Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, Iron Man) are very impressive.While this movie captures your attention almost the whole way through, it does fall through in the third quarter and I was really beginning to lose interest. This is then justified by the final act which is nothing short of exceptional. All this said, this film isn't so much a ""true"" serial killer film. It falls into that same category of similar films like ""Jarhead"", often called a war movie without the war (also starring Gyllenhaal). While the film offers plentiful amounts of blood, violence and frightening encounters with the Zodiac killer - the picnic scene is truly one of the most terrifying in cinema - this film is much more about the social impact this one man had during these years. At the heart of ""Zodiac"" is something much more real than any other serial killer film before.8.5/10 Hamish Kearvell A.K.A Screaming Japan Productions - www.myspace.com/screamingjapanproductions",Zodiac

513,mryerson,Flabby thriller,6,20 August 2007,"Absent an original script written for the screen, one of the essential talents of the filmmaker is knowing what (from the book, the play, the serial) to leave in and what to leave out. You get no style points for including it all and likely you get a poor film to boot. With Zodiac you get a film that dazzles and dazzles and dazzles and...Pretty soon you just want it to be over. Much of the dazzle is stylish and interesting but fails to advance the storyline. Hard to know where to place the blame for this but likely the director and editor were in cahoots. Too long by at least 40 minutes, there is a good, maybe great, movie in here, buried under excess celluloid. Director Fincher has established his reputation with a small repertoire consisting mainly of Se7en (a knockout), Fight Club (a TKO) and The Game (a slick psychological thriller in spite of the presence of 'names' Michael Douglas and Sean Penn). With the Jodie Foster vehicle, Panic Room, a little suspicion crept in as the film was too slick, too commercial, almost bland, the camera lingering on Ms. Foster's face when a more crisp look would have added to the tension. But such are the compromises forced into a production with a 'star'. And now we have Zodiac, a project with several preproduction puzzles it never seems to solve. First and most obviously, it is based on a well-known series of murders, so how to tell the story and create and sustain some dramatic tension when the resolution (or lack thereof) is widely known? Secondly, it is based on a popular book written by a peripheral player in the developing news story who is consequently a character in the movie, so how to tell what is essentially a first person narrative and still introduce expository material? And thirdly, it is a story of many parts, ranging over several decades with numerous important characters, so how to tell the story and still provide the audience with a singular POV, a third person narrative(?), first person(?), where is the satisfying continuity with which the audience can identify? In the case of Zodiac, the sum of its parts is impressive film-making that fail to add up to an impressive film. Unfortunately there are simply too many parts. What starts out reasonably enough with a pre-opening credit murder and proceeds in what appears to be the tried-and-true, story-told-through-the-eyes-of-an-innocent, becomes a seemingly endless series of storyboarded vignettes artlessly separated with elided time notations, ""two weeks later"" fade, ""three months later"" fade, ""two years later"" fade, my gawd, there must be thirty of em! The casting is wonderful, not a false note in the lot, especially Robert Downey, Jr. who mesmerizes as the burnt-out crime beat reporter Paul Avery, who is so consistently good it has become almost trite to sing his praises. They should just give this guy an Academy Award every year and be done with it. Jake Gyllenhaal does a nice job with a thankless stock role and Mark Ruffalo rings true as the frustrated homicide detective. There is little dropoff in quality as you get into the supporting roles and bit players, Chloe Sevigny as the long suffering wife, Anthony Edwards as the bland partner and an amusing turn from Brian Cox as the pretentious, self-absorbed Melvin Belli. The cinematography is crisp and inventive, the score a period-correct mix of rock and R&B, the dialogue feels natural and unforced with a satisfying mix of cynicism, humor and angst, the production and art design, costumes, locations, hairstyles and sundry props perfectly capture the period and the communications, written and voice, with which the Zodiac taunts the authorities, provides a nice over-the-shoulder feel to the proceedings. So where did they go wrong? In the early going it looks as though we'll see the story through the eyes of the Gyllenhaal/Graysmith character but he is supplanted by a blinding series of set-piece murders and near murders larded with the obligatory gnashing of investigative teeth which then give way to a police procedural coupled with the deteriorating Downey/Avery character before we return to the Gyllenhaal/Graysmith character for a really bang-up, creepy, skin-crawly closing thirty minutes, all the while the director advancing the narrative line with the aforementioned typeset screen cards. My best guess is that Fincher should have stayed with the Gyllenhaal character as first person narrator. He is a nice wide eyed innocent in the newsroom, whose discovery of the various players and his subsequent discovery of critical evidence would nicely serve as our discovery. Using the newcomer in this way is an old plot device but nonetheless satisfying and effective. It could have worked. Perhaps that's what Fincher thinks he did. Alternatively, how about largely eliminating the Gyllenhaal character and going with a straightforward police procedural. Let the Ruffalo character run with it, let his frustration be our frustration. Let us suffer as he descends into late-career with this failure of a case around his neck. It could work. Perhaps that's what Fincher thinks he did. Alas, the film tries to be all things to all men. And fails to be any one thing. By the way, I wouldn't make any changes that would jeopardize the last thirty or forty whizbang minutes of the film. Damn, there's a really fine ninety-five to a hundred-twenty minute film in here, somewhere.",Zodiac

516,DigitalPhreaker,Even Better than Expected,9,3 March 2007,"Robert Graysmith (Gyllenhaal) was just a cartoonist. Paul Avery (Downey, Jr.) was just a reporter. David Toschi (Mark Ruffalo) was just a police inspector. They did their jobs, their day-to-day lives without many problems. They all lived in their own worlds, their secure worlds, and did not have much to object about. Avery enjoyed drinks at the bar with his bosses and coworkers while sometimes covering the news (or throwing his own spin on it). Toschi solved the crimes of San Fransisco and enjoyed his insatiable craving for animal crackers. Graysmith went about invisible at the San Fransisco Chronicle, ignored by the ""real"" employees because of his status as just a cartoonist. All that began to change, however, in the Summer of 1969 when two young lovers were brutally shot in Vallejo by a man who would soon coin himself as the 'Zodiac.' The obsession of catching the murderer, or the disgust caused by his crimes, would drive the cop, the simple reporter, and the invisible cartoonist down a path that few would want to travel for nearly 22 years.David Fincher, of Fight Club and Se7en fame, always manages to land the perfect story to use as his next great thriller. Alongside of that, he gets the opportunity to work with some of the finest actors in our generation, many of whom have either won an Oscar, or have been nominated. Zodiac is no different. Fincher starts the story right off the bat with the murder and attempted murder of the Zodiac's first two victims, David Arthur Faraday, 17, and Betty Lou Jensen, 16. For the next 2 and a half hours, it is a spiraling ride down into the world of murder, obsession, and the ugly side of the world that people seem to shy away from.Fincher is in fine form, as usual, mixing his unique ability to capture the smallest of emotions of his actors, to choreographing some of the coolest shots using both CGI and real life images. Much like the great opening scene in Fight Club, Fincher blends the use of his camera and the power of a computer to make some very compelling and awesome shots, for example the quick ten second shot of the entire construction of the Transamerica Tower. But do not think that this is the only high point of Zodiac.Gyllenhaal, Downey, Jr, and Ruffalo (or ""The Three"" as I will refer to them) jumped so deep into their roles that it was hard to separate the actors from the people they were portraying, most notably Mark Ruffalo. A local reviewer here in Arizona called him a chameleon, being able to literally become the character, while most actors simply portray the character. This is the best way to describe Ruffalo, who has played so many different characters in the past 4 years it is hard to believe he can do such a great job. For instance, he played the quirky yet nerdy Stan in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, the bad ass yet incredibly Hispanic looking Detective Fanning in Collateral (who I did not realize was in fact Ruffalo until I saw the end credits), and a few typical male characters in romantic comedies. That is what is so great about Ruffalo. He is the character he is portraying.Robert Downey, Jr., is quickly becoming one of my favorite actors. It seems to me that after he got over his drug problems and started taking on more interesting roles, his career became hotter than ever before. Downey has been in some of my favorite movies in the past seven years (Wonder Boys, Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, Good Night, and Good Luck, and A Scanner Darkly). His style is very subtle and dry, yet he is such an engaging presence on the screen and his wit is so sharp that I honestly would watch any movie with Robert Downey, Jr., in it and probably enjoy it. His portrayal of the drug/alcohol addicted Paul Avery would have been funny if you did not feel so bad for the guy after he looses his job.And we cannot forget Jake Gyllenhaal! Gyllenhaal has a different style completely different than the others. Jake has this natural innocence that caught my attention when I first saw him in October Sky and has used that innocence to make the audience feel more connected with whatever character he was playing, even the infamous Donnie Darko. With his boyish face and good looks, he can pull of playing just about any type of character and it was really refreshing to see him change so much over the course of the film. In the beginning, he was the quiet book worm who kept to himself. By the end of the film, he was so obsessed with the idea of just finding out who Zodiac was (not necessarily catching him, just solving the ultimate puzzle) that he had neglected everything and everyone in his life to find all the answers to write his book.All-in-all, Zodiac is a fantastic film. So far, it is one of the best so far of this year, and I think it will be hard pressed to be forgotten. In what could have easily been a boring adaptation turned into an incredibly tense yet sometimes funny biography of all the people who were so affected by this madman, and had never even met him. We all know the ending basically. The Zodiac Killer was never caught. Some might look at this and wonder what the point of seeing the movie is then, but you have to realize that the purpose behind Zodiac is not purely a detective story where we find out who the killer is and how he did it (like C.S.I. or Law & Order), but it also a very engaging character study about how, like the tag line says, 'there's more than one way to lose your life to a killer.'",Zodiac
517,DamnYouGoogle,You know whats also slow and unappealing? Taking a dump.,3,13 April 2010,"There is a lot wrong with zodiac but most of it can be summed up in one word, SLOW, now I im not some guy that needs a non stop action thriller fast paced bombardment of action, in fact im quite the opposite, but this is unacceptable the tension of the movie is already compromised by knowing the outcome before the movie starts at least as far as the serial killer plot goes, obviously he is never caught. In the meantime its just a play by play of what was happening that anyone watching the news in the 70's could have seen, mixed with a ho hum story based on the paranoia of a local reporter. I mean the acting is solid for it is which saves it from being a complete abortion, but aside from that its just a slow paced snore fest that makes The Human Condition trilogy look like it has a Transformers like pace in comparison, and thats like 9 and half hours long.",Zodiac
518,tgarnett25,"""A Fine Film In The Tradition Of Docudramas""",9,3 March 2007,"There really isn't much that I can add to what's already been said. This is a great movie, and the further back in time that Fincher takes us, the more dazzling it becomes--his use of colors, in particular. The sequences used to recreate the era of the early seventies was especially haunting--it comes across as surreal...as if it was extracted directly from our memories of that period, more so than photographs, or films.This film has the walk, and it has the talk that makes for a memorable epic.If I have any criticism, it is that David Fincher's characteristic impressionism--his mind blowing spontanaeity--is sorely lacking in the production. On the other hand, did we want a funky story, or did we want the facts? Fincher is into the realism of this, and it shows in each, meticulously crafted frame of this gruesome, spellbinding saga.A formidable piece.",Zodiac
519,tabestorm,Not that interesting,7,19 May 2020,"The acting was good, but the movie doesn't really know what to focus on. There are several protagonists and there's a little drama, but it's not a real drama. And there's some violence and some suspense, but you can hardly call this a thriller.
I enjoyed this for the acting of Gyllenhaal, Ruffalo and Downey junior and the funny parts. And one particular scene when Gyllenhaal visits a filmmaker at his home. But overall.. it was a very long movie and I wasn't emotionally attached to it. It wasn't like I couldn't pause the movie to take a leak or grab some snacks.",Zodiac
520,StayPuft003,David Fincher's Zodiac...,9,10 March 2007,"David Fincher, although having made few films, is clearly proving to the film world that he is one of the elite directors in recent history. His new film, Zodiac, is just another example of Fincher's genius. The beginning of the film starts out with the initial murder, and it is very creepy, and VERY realistic. Right off the bat, the viewer can get a good idea about how the film is going to play out. It is very dark and very mysterious. The first hour of the movie moves very quickly with witty and intriguing dialog that keeps the viewer anxious to see how the events work themselves out.All of the actors, especially Mark Ruffalo and Robert Downey Jr., are phenomenal. And you can't forget about Jake Gyllenhaal, who I believe is one of the more underrated actors of today. Brian Cox, Elias Koteas, and even Donal Logue are very good as well.Also, even though it has a long 2 hour and 40 minute running time, it moves quickly and it barely feels as long as it truly is. This is mostly due to the great script by James Vanderbilt's script. It knows it's characters, and it figures out a way to get into the characters' heads without making it over-dramatic or corny.Lastly, The main factor that holds this film together is Fincher's directing. Obviously he is a good director, and going into the film I knew I would be in for something interesting. It was clear at most times that Fincher picked his shots out very precisely, enhancing the film's mood and keeping the film interesting throughout. Some scenes were so well-done it was haunting, especially the murder scenes. Even though the characters are on-screen for such little time, you feel for them and even cringe when they face their fates at the hand of the Zodiac.The soundtrack also deserves a lot of praise, for it keeps the nostalgic feeling of the 70's present while adding tension to some scenes that didn't even necessarily need the music in the first place.The only flaw of the movie is that at times it becomes a bit repetitive, but that is part of it's magic. The mix of the script, directing, and editing, does not even make the viewer realize this fact. But when it is evident, it is clear that the repetition is intentional to enhance the sense of obsession most of the character's feel.David Fincher's Zodiac is a very intriguing film that manages to make the viewer become more obsessed with the outcome of the film as the main characters become more obsessed with the case. All in all, it is a very mysterious, edge-of-your-seat thriller that is worthy of multiple viewings and is a must see not only for fans of Fincher, but fans of film in general.",Zodiac
521,sweetlittlepie,"It's no Seven, but it's still a great film",8,25 April 2009,"Sure this movie is not Fincher's masterpiece Seven, but it's not to say that it does not stand as a great film. It's a great movie that has you in the edge of your seat even if you already know what's going to happen because it's common knowledge and who hasn't heard of the infamous Zodiac killer. He terrorized San Francisco and his case remains a mystery to this very day. I think everyone back in those days who lived in California had an idea of who the Zodiac might be. What makes this serial killer so interesting and what differences him from others is the fact that he willingly gave clues. He told people what he was going to do he just never told you when. He liked to play cat and mouse games with the cops, and he liked to taunt the media. He was egoistical and arrogant, he knew people were afraid of him and what he might do next and he enjoyed that.The movie holds great performances by it's leads; Jake Gyllenhaal, Mark Ruffalo and the great Robert Downey Jr. Fincher is great as always utilizing shadows, noises and the night as his ally in the story telling. The film's pace is a bit slow, but it's worth a watch. Fincher once again shows why he is a great story teller. He never falter in any of his films and he always delivers. He has already been nominated for an Oscar and one day he is going to holding one, that's a no brainier.",Zodiac
522,Ndirsch11,'Zodiac' is an Engrossing Murder Mystery,7,8 March 2007,"The latest film by director David Fincher (Se7en, Fight Club) is not your standard crime drama or psychological thriller. Whereas most films dealing with crime try to pump up the action and suspense, 'Zodiac' is more concerned with intrigue, procedure, and investigation. This is a gritty, detail-oriented, documentary-like film that aims for realism and authenticity. Although 'Zodiac' is about a notorious serial killer, it's investigative journalism that is the film's primary focus. Because the culprit was never caught the story is told from the perspective of those who became caught up in the case. 'Zodiac' is ultimately a tale about an obsession: the killer's obsession with violence, the public's fascination with crime, and the journalist's obsession to crack the case.'Zodiac' is a true story recounting the details of one of the most notorious murder mysteries in American history. The Zodiac was a serial killer who made a series of seemingly random murders in the San Francisco Bay area in the late 60's and early 70's. What set the case apart was the fact that the killer took credit for his crimes and even went so far as to contact local newspapers to brag about what he had done. The Zodiac would provide clues to his identity in elaborate symbols and codes sketched out on paper. He would make threats to the press that if they didn't publish his confessions he would commit even more gruesome crimes. The press faced a dilemma: disobey the Zodiac and risk more lives or submit to his demands and give legitimacy to a murderer.We never get a good look at the Zodiac because, after all, he was never actually caught. The primary suspect, Arthur Allen, eventually died of a heart attack before he could be brought into custody. It's unclear if he could have been charged for any crime since his fingerprints never matched the ones at the scene of the crimes.The elusiveness of the case caused more than a few headaches for those involved in solving it. A reporter for the San Francisco Enquirer, Paul Avery (Robert Downey Jr.), thinks he knows the psychology of the Zodiac better than anyone. Avery is not so sure the killer is always telling the truth and is more convinced that the Zodiac is just some perverted narcissist trying to get attention. Others on the case, such as Inspector David Toschi (Mark Ruffalo), come up against so many hurdles in the investigation that they're forced to give up. Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal), a cartoonist for the San Francisco Enquirer, is an exception. Rather than give up on a case that seems to have no end in sight, he becomes obsessed with solving it even at the cost of sacrificing any semblance of a personal life. By the end of the tale, Graysmith is convinced he knows who the killer is. But after ten years of investigation, will anyone believe him? At nearly three hours in length, 'Zodiac' is a long film and certainly feels like it. Although Fincher and the screenwriter, James Vanderbilt, keep the story moving along at a brisk pace, the film ultimately gets bogged down in an endless parade of names, dates, plot points, and other details. You almost have to bring a notepad to keep track of all the events in the story. This is not a fault of the filmmakers but rather an inevitable problem in any movie based on a true story. There's not a lot of thematic depth here because the story itself is murky and inconclusive. Vanderbilt's screenplay is very strong and does a good job of creating genuine interest in the characters. A minor flaw lies in the inclusion of the story of Graysmith's wife, played by Chloe Sevigny. Sevigny, unfortunately, is given very little to do other than stand around and look worried. In a story like this there's not a lot of room for diversion.Despite these complaints 'Zodiac' is a good film and certainly well worth checking out. Even though it's incredibly long I was, nevertheless, always interested and intrigued by the story. All the performances are good, particularly Jake Gyllenhaal who's emerging as one of the finest actors working today. David Fincher's directing is appropriately moody and atmospheric and the production values are great: the CGI shots of San Francisco as it appeared in the 70's are very convincing. For those interested in unsolved murder mysteries, 'Zodiac' should certainly prove to be one of the better films of its kind in recent memory.",Zodiac
523,energyzeezo,It's like The Usual Suspects.. without the plot twist..,6,11 April 2017,"The film didn't finish its job properly, it takes you through 2 hours and 37 minutes of heavy police work only to slam you in the face with one of those text written ""they lived happily ever after"" endings.The movie is good, but ""good"" as in keeping the viewer occupied, yet it doesn't feed your inner detective or present you with a mind bending mystery, just a guy and a couple of cops going through evidence after evidence, they discover something.. it cancels something they've already assumed and so on.At first they show you ciphers and codes, you get excited thinking this will be a great mystery movie based on code breaking.. WRONG.. they skip that part pretty quickly.. next.. you see patterns in murders.. you think you'll see a thrilling chase on how they'll track the killer by figuring him out.. WRONG.. they focus on the most trivial aspects of a murder.. next.. they show you that the killer was challenging the police.. don't get any ideas.. WRONG!!! they've completely ignored everything relating to that..all the focus of the movie is oriented around finding his identity without examining evidence.. collecting as much circumstantial nonsense and making sense out of it.. The movie fools you too often, for bad not good.. you expect something awesome only to be surprised by the exact opposite.. it has succeeded on many levels but has failed on most.. this isn't your typical Sherlock unveiling the truth movie.. just a fanatic obsessed with finding a killer.. 6/10 is a very generous score in my opinion..",Zodiac

However, the subject matter was interesting. I am middle aged but did not have a lot of knowledge about the story so I found it fairly interesting, although wanting for suspense and action. The movie was well cast, however the action / screen play was limited. ***** SPOILERS BELOW ****** Not a lot of suspense except: The basement sceneAttended movie with my son and he felt that when the movie FINALLY ended it was reminiscent of the movie LIMBO where it just ended without a lot of closure.

Jake Gyllenhaal, Robert Downey Jr., and Mark Ruffalo all turn in impressive performances (though Downey's is the one that should be best remembered at Oscar season) as three men - two reporters, one detective - who never leave the case of the Zodiac Killer, a man who haunted Northern California for years. But this movie is not really about who Zodiac was, but on the power of obsession, on how men will devote their lives to chasing dragons at the cost of everything else. Fincher adheres to a strict timeline - shooting what new information appeared and little else. Nonetheless, the costs of pursuing the Zodiac are never far. Gyllenhaal, playing controversial reporter Robert Graysmith, Downey, playing reporter Paul Avery, and Ruffalo, playing Inspector Toschi, are all damaged by their pursuit of Zodiac, but are unable to stop. They are driven as much by their own intellectual vanity as by a desire to see justice done. As time progresses, and others forget about the case, they linger. They are career men forever haunted by the unknown. Their lives, and our lives when we watch, are driven by discovery, and hampered by the lack. They grow older, and we recognize our own inabilities to leave our intellectual obsessions behind, to put away our toys. And when the ending does come, we are left with a feeling of closure, but also with a sense that we can never leave that night when Michael Mageau and Darlene Ferrin were shot. We are forever stranded on July 4, 1969, when Hurdy Gurdy Man played.",Zodiac
526,i_skyba,"A good detective with elements of a thriller, but with disadvantages",8,2 May 2020,"Overall an interesting detective with great actors. The film is based on real events. In addition, the director allows us to think with the characters, analyze and make assumptions. The atmosphere of that time was perfectly conveyed.However, there are downsides. The movie has a lot of details, side characters, so it's worth watching it closely. It is also unclear at some points how the police were unable to relate to the facts that the main character had linked in a decade. In addition, the movie seems a little tight.A bit about the cast of actors. Jake Gyllenhaal played his character perfectly - a cartoonist of a local newspaper whose obsession with the investigation is
unclear to the naked eye and the film's authors are not explained that.
Therefore, this can be explained by one of the cognitive distortions - the need for completion. The game of other actors also left a good impression. A special colorful character in Robert Downey Jr. , the role of which was one of the steps to return to the big cinema.8/10.

Instead, he has created a true crime film that is both engaging and very stylish. That being said, he still manages to sneak in moments of suspense, and does so in a very masterful way.

529,poojucu,Impressive Film,9,16 May 2007,"A film by the director David Fincher will always have fans waiting.His latest is Zodiac about the famous real-life series of murders in California in the late 1960's.The film opens with the murder of a young couple and follows pretty quickly with a second attempt. But then the focus of the film swings to San Francisco and the office of the Chronicle, the newspaper which became a conduit for Zodiac's taunting the police and panicking the public.ROBERT DOWNEY JR plays the Chronicle's star crime reporter John Avery, whose drug and alcohol-fueled life got a boost from his connection with Zodiac. Jake Gyllenhaal plays Robert Graysmith, the political cartoonist of the paper who, although on the sidelines, also became obsessed with finding Zodiac.MARK RUFFALO plays Inspector Toschi, another life that would be affected by this case.What is impressive about this film is the meticulous way in which an incredible amount of detail is made cohesive. Based on Graysmith's best-selling books about the crimes the film is fascinating in its process of detecting but it's also compelling in showing how the obsession to discover the identity of Zodiac impacted on the lives of three men.Shot in high definition digital video by Harris Savides it is evocative of the times and seamless.Performances are tops but what is surprising, considering Fincher was the director, it's really non-sensational.It's a most mature work by this very talented director",Zodiac

I have to say I have never heard of Zodiac before this, and didn't really care about the facts when I heard about them in this movie. However that's what this is all about. The whole script, written by someone who grew up in the area at the time and was fascinated by the Zodiac killings, painstakingly and painfully follows the investigation for him. Every ten minutes, the film cuts to a random date in the future (and tells you) when the next interesting event happens. It is like a blow-by-blow reconstruction. There really is no dramatisation at all. Even by the time of the second murder, the scene was dragged out so much, you wish Zodiac would just get on with it.Then the inept, bureaucratic nightmare of police investigations starts (multiple officers are involved as the murders happened in different counties). Yes, it's great to see that it took the police 1 and a half years to get a warrant for one suspect and so on, but did I really care? To compound this, there are so many suspects and threads of evidence and handwriting samples that you get detached from it all and again lose interest.Then there is Graysmith himself. He is utterly unconvincing. He comes across as a bit of a lunatic who is even more obsessed than the screenwriter about this case. Sevens year later he turns up at a police station after dark to demand to see their files there and then. He keeps harrassing one of the old detectives who had been in charge of it years earlier. He even doesn't care when his family leave him and he gets anonymous calls every week. I have to say I was hoping Zodiac would come and finish him off just so the movie could end.",Zodiac

533,jamie-carrick,"""Just because you can't prove it doesn't mean it's not true""",10,10 September 2016,"With Fincher's ""Se7en"" ingrained in my mind from repetitive viewing, I was ready to expect another film in the same realm. My overall thought: Same subject matter, completely different results. Now, standing at a very lengthy 160 minutes long, this film requires close attention, quiet concentration and no disturbances. There's no doubt that this film is very thrilling, but there is also a lot of close analysis and theorising involved, making it very complex. I have a policy in place which is if I start a movie, I have to see it through unless something prevents me from doing so. ""Zodiac"" was no exception to this rule and I was glad that I didn't give up on it. This film was never going to please everybody. A lot of people are disappointed by lack of action in a movie and I am definitely not one of them. I watch a movie for its depth, plot, characterisation and acting performances. This film covered every one of those and pulled them off with aplomb. The case of the Zodiac Killer is one of the most famous in criminal history and notorious for being unsolved, even if the evidence was rather convincing, and David Fincher uses this opportunity to gather together a thesis of sorts that combs through substantial pieces of evidence and uses the medium of film to piece it together in a highly entertaining way. The acting performances, especially those of Gyllenhaal and Ruffalo, were remarkable. The way that Robert Graysmith evolves over the course of his story arc really played to Gyllenhaal's skills, as audiences would later observe in the chilling 'Nightcrawler'. Graysmith goes from being a socially awkward, rambling, polished cartoonist to a man whom is almost unrecognisable. Graysmith becomes obsessive, impolite with a gritty determination to solve the case that originally stemmed from a simple love of puzzles. Mark Ruffalo is strong as ever in his role as investigator Dave Toschi, tasked with the elaborate quest to uncover the identity of the Zodiac Killer. So, all in all, this film is not for those who aren't willing to pay attention. It's not a non- stop action thriller, though there are some moments, particularly towards the latter end of the movie, which do grip you. What Fincher has accomplished is an in depth look into an infamous cold case, which provides solid theories, all while creating entertainment and characterisation that really drives the story home. Not an easy task, given the abundance of scenes that are merely focused on handwriting samples and analysis of other evidence samples. Though do not misunderstand me, this movie is certainly not boring or dull, it is entertaining and you will get a lot out of it, if not only a burning desire to discover the real identity of the Zodiac Killer.

Gyllenhaal is kinda bland in the beginning, but comes alive and is great in the last hour and a half. Robert Downey Jr. turns in another great performance. Mark Ruffalo is great as well. John Carroll Lynch and Brian Cox also make the most of their appearances.

536,robwealer,Very hard to like...,5,25 July 2007,"I think this film went overboard on authenticity with regard to culture of the 70's, right down to oppressive aspects of general thinking of that time and lack of openness. Had a really hard time liking any of the characters or caring what happened to them and there seemed to be a failed attempt to weave quirkiness into Gyllenhall's and Ruffalo's character that never really left the ground. (eg. animal crackers, etc.) Delivery was very flat and uninteresting, not to mention obvious mistakes/gaps in investigation that any ardent CSI viewer would pick up on in a flash. (ie. the guys aviation boots, shoe size. Relying on eye witness testimony over forensic evidence AND the complete lack of communication between departments while a killer is on a spree was hard to imagine.) Also, cutting this guy loose without a tail or someone following him blew me away. This film gave me a headache. Robert Downey junior seemed tied up and struggling in a sludgy environment and skillfully brought some creativity and life to the story without taking it over, which he could have done without thinking. He seemed to realize that to cross that line would really illustrate how flat things were with rest of the cast. Each player seemed tied to the lowest common denominator of delivery and feared rising above it for the sake of continuity.",Zodiac

Knowing this is an unsolved case, I debated whether it is worth watching. I watched it for the strong cast, Jake Gyllenhaal, Robert Downey Jr. And Mark Ruffalo.I can't say I am disappointed. The movie explored the case through view points of reporter Paul Avery (Robert Downey, Jr) and cartoonist Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal). It seems more about the characters - their devotion and even obsession about solving the case, rather than solving the case. I don't think the film gets closer to ""finding out"" who was Zodiac. The acting is good. Some of the scenes are intense. Overall a good film.",Zodiac
538,Mr_W,Pretty good if a tad long murder mystery,7,10 July 2007,"I came into this movie with an open mind, since I didn't know anything about The Zodiac Killer in advance. After finishing the film the main thought I had: what's the point of having a 2½ h film over this, when there's no conclusion? Of course real events can't be changed thus the ending, but at least 45 minutes of this film could have been cut to save some of the meaningless plot points out. Actually it can be a pretty big bore unless you're really fascinated with the subject, as Fincher obviously was. I'm against the trend of movie starting to be longer and longer, often exceeding the two hour mark. A movie just has to have a lot of meat in it's bones to be that long.Then the good parts. There was no gratuitous violence, in fact only a few of the dozen or so murders was shown on screen. This is really refreshing with all these ultra violent movies these days. The movie making is solid, when you watch it you get the feeling of a quality movie. It ain't no Fight Club or Seven, as has probably been pointed out many times, but it's a good movie nonetheless. The acting by most people was excellent, especially Gyllenhaal, who I thought actually was the killer! Actually it would have been a much better movie if it was him, but again you can't change reality. The look of 70's was well present.What bugged me a little was the poor methods the investigators used in solving the case. Not once did I see the envelopes checked for prints (perhaps I missed it), or an attempt to trace the calls, or other similar tricks. Perhaps this is how it really was back then.",Zodiac
539,Tapion101,Zodiac: A dull thriller,1,21 February 2007,"My college theater had a screening of Zodiac. I kind of wish now we didn't have it.David Fincher was the master of thrillers in the 90s. Se7en, The Game, and Fight Club. All amazing thrillers/dramas. Then he came out with Panic Room in 2002. Not a bad thriller, but no where near his films in the 90s. Now, he has come out with Zodiac, and it seems that whatever magic he had in the 90s is now lost.Zodiac is a dull thriller in which you know what is going to happened before it even happens. It is long(running around 2 hours and 45 minutes), repetitive, and just plain boring. Aside from the great acting(Downey again has a magnificent performance), the film offers nothing special.It's main issue is that it is too predictable. You basically know what is going to happened at the start of every scene. Nothing catches you by surprise at all in this film. Another issue is that the killer isn't scary at all. His purpose for killing and his method of killing people is just nothing special. He's just a messed up guy who uses gloves. That's about it. And the last and biggest issue is that it is TOO LONG! If you're going to have a predictable film, DON'T MAKE IT ALMOST 2 HOURS AND 45 MINUTES!!! Now, I will say that the acting is GREAT. Gyllenhall, Ruffalo, and Downey give great performances. Hell, I think I would have walked out of the film had the acting not been so great.Bottom line: Not a bad film(cause of acting), but no where near a good film. I recommend to skip Zodiac, even if you're a huge David Fincher fan. Maybe catch it on DVD if you're REALLY bored one night.",Zodiac
540,belzebuebchen,In the sign of the Seventies,8,7 June 2007,"If you're expecting another SE7EN from David Fincher you'll be disappointed. ZODIAC is not a conventional thriller, in fact, it never shocks at all. Knowing that the real Zodiac-crimes where never solved and knowing that Fincher would never fictionalize a true story makes it difficult to move towards a climax.It's actual strength lies in the almost perfect citation of early 70's movie making. This works on three levels: The ""outer"", meaning the look of the film. The colors are reduced but heavy, the camera-movements are as slow as is the editing.The ""inner""-level - the designs, the cars, the hair-dues, the phones, the clothes - makes you feel, you're watching an episode of ""Kojak"".And finally, the ""perceptional"" level: As a moviegoer of the 21st century you are constantly faced with what it must have felt like to see a film in, let's say 1971. When someone gets killed, it's in a long, torturing shot - no ""bullet-time"" here folks! It's a blessing for a change.Of course, when you think of San Francisco and Crime you think of DIRTY HARRY. And he actually appears in ZODIAC. As the film ZODIAC can't be. Because it's heroes - unlike Harry Callahan - go by the book. Interestingly enough that the character ""Scorpio"" in DIRTY HARRY was influenced by the Zodiac-killings.The other movie that seems to be heavily influential on ZODIAC is ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN. Because most of the crime solving here also takes place in an editorial office. At a time when there was no internet, no cell phones and even faxes where rare it becomes obvious that the main problem to find the killer is not the evidence but the communication amongst the observers.That's the center of Fincher's film: To show that in real live police-work is as vulnerable to human mistakes as is an argument amongst married people. And that serial killers are no psycho-geniuses, just every day lunatics.",Zodiac
541,nrcsinger,Insert zodiac killer meme here,7,15 May 2019,"Personally, I was pretty excited to see Mark Ruffalo and RDJ in a movie that predates the 2012 avengers movie, particularly Mark Ruffalo who was not involved in the Incredible Hulk movie. Getting back to the Zodiac, I was initially surprised by the runtime. With a runtime of over 2 and a half hours, I was interested to see how they kept the audience's attention.In terms of the music, I always enjoy a movie where the music has lyrics that fit into the story and add to the overall theme. Starting out the opening with the song, ""Easy to be Hard"" was an interesting choice. I felt as though the first line ""how can people be so heartless"" was a strong start for this movie. The songs chosen added another layer to the movie and made me feel as though I was learning more about the characters that I would not necessarily get through standard dialogue.All in all, I thought the movie was well done.",Zodiac
542,kdcndw,excellent true crime film,8,11 January 2008,"Zodiac...a film that was somewhat ignored upon it's original release hopefully will find new life with the issuing of the stellar director's cut on DVD. It was one of my favorite films from last year. Watching the director's cut reconfirms it. The dc doesn't add much running time to the movie..but the additions were welcome. Back to the film. Zodiac shows a real maturity for director Fincher after his forgettable ""style exercise"" panic room. The film has a gripping slow build that is a welcome relief to all the add directed movies of today. Fincher's direction compliments mostly great acting from all involved. No overtly flash for flash sakes moments in the film. The direction is stylized but in a more organic way. This organic method also makes ""Zodiac"" the most convincing film environment Fincher has created. The film has this almost documentary film that really pulls you in. It would be unfair to discuss the film's success without mentioning the incredible screenplay. The writer (forget his name) made some choices that were surprising and believable. The procedural part of the movie felt spot in. but ---spoilers---it's the next to the last scene in the movie that really blew me away. It's the traditional protagonist meets antagonist moment. But there is not much dialog..no real action...just two people looking at each other and finding a kind of closure. The writer deserves credit to trust the audience to just look at people thinking..not saying a word..while conveying all that is needed to be said.--spoilers end---Course it is mandatory that the audience is PAYING ATTENTION and maybe this faith the writer had in the audience resulted in a weak theatrical run for the film. Maybe the writer gave to much credit to the average movie goer. However, I am pretty sure this film will be remembered for years to come. end kdc",Zodiac

The main character was like something from a kids TV show. He was OK in spiderman but rubbish in this. This film is a mish mash of ideas that don't quite gel. As with all of Fincher's movies, cinematography is good, but the script is a shambles and Fincher has got lost trying to do something he just can't do, work with a complicated script and make it an engrossing piece of work. Fincher is good with a simple premise such as The Game and Fight Club but Brian De Palma he ain't.I fell asleep half way through this film and left before the end as did a few other people.

545,Terminator97C,Zodiac welcomes back David Fincher,8,20 April 2007,"The word remake has to be the most popular word in Hollywood right now. So many films are being released recently that are remakes of previous films, especially in the horror/thriller genre. The worst part is that very few of them are any good. In a quick attempt to make a few dollars, movie studios stick to the same formula. The most important part is do not come up with original idea; instead just redo a movie that was already successful in the past. Second add a handful of inexperienced actors and directors. Finally pump a whole bunch of money into advertising and you are guaranteed to make a bad movie and rake in tons of cash in the process. This film is no different.""When a Stranger Calls"" stays close to the same premise from the original 1979 film of the same name. The sad thing is that even the plot from the first film was fairly bland. Jill Johnson (Camilla Belle) is experiencing the usual high school drama and feels like nothing is going right for her. First her boyfriend ended up kissing one of good friends at a party. Then she went over her cell phone service plan by 800 minutes and now she is grounded for a month.Therefore Jill cannot attend the huge bonfire party that everyone in her high school is going to. Instead she has to baby-sit. When she arrives at the house the kids are already asleep and the parents give her a quick tour of their beautiful house. Once Jill is alone in the house she starts to receive odd phone calls from a person that says nothing. After the caller continues for some time Jill becomes scared and calls the police. The police call back and tell Jill that the calls have been traced and are coming from within the house. That is it. That is the whole plot and somehow they manage to drag it out to an already lacking running time of 1 hour and 23 minutes. Not to mention the first and last scene of the film should be removed because they serve absolutely no purpose whatsoever. It seems like the creators just threw the two scenes in the film in order to give it a longer running time.The infamous scene where Jill finds out the call is coming from inside the house was the driving force of the 1979 version, but the modern version uses the scene as its main advertising focus. This then ruins the only good thrill that the movie could have had because everyone already knows it is going to happen.""When a Stranger Calls"" is filled with plot holes, impossibilities, and inconsistencies that make an already poor film even worse. The movie also takes every opportunity to use a cheap scare when Jill goes multiple times to investigate a noise in the house and is startled by everything possible.The only praise that can be given to this film is that it does attempt to build up to a strong climax. ""When a Stranger Calls"" has a very classic thriller feel to it, which can only be praised so much because of the fact is a remake of a classic thriller. Unlike the trend nowadays where films have scares and deaths every few minutes in order to hold the attention of the young teen audience the movies are targeted for.The next thing to look forward to is when ""When a Stranger Calls"" comes out on DVD and the movie studios will resort to their second best money making formula. Release an unrated version that is almost exactly the same as the original.",Zodiac
546,silver808,A Modern Classic,10,9 July 2013,"In the same way that virtually everyone knows the verdict in Oliver Stone's brilliant movie JFK, I should think everyone who is interested in the Zodiac case, should know, just like JFK, it was never solved. The Zodiac by David Fincher, is a film about the investigation that took place into this elusive serial killer, who in my mind may not have been a serial killer at all, but a group of killers. That is the fascination of the Zodiac case, the fact that it was never solved. This fascination is shared by many many people even today.David Fincher's Zodiac is in the tradition of the classic intelligent conspiracy thrillers, such as JFK, ALL THE PRESIDENTS MEN and the EIGER SANCTION. It is most certainly a character driven movie, focusing on the driven characters who try to hunt down and figure out from the plethora of cryptic messages and scant testimony of witnesses , who the zodiac is. It is a movie about the fascination the Zodiac case had on someone and how they get so obsessed with the mysterious killer, that they give up everything in order to find out who he is. It is very well made and very entertaining and like the case, fascinating. It is filmed in the periods of 1969 to 1991 , and looks authentic, the period details very convincing, they transport you to the times. This is another thing in favour of this film, the way it looks, and also how it was acted by the two leads, who play the newspaper men who got caught up in the fascination trap of trying to crack the Zodiac puzzle. All through the movie we trace them in the centre of it , and are shown how the obsession affects their lives forever. The important characters in this film, to me, are the newspaper men, rather than the police involved, as to them it is just routine and part of their Job. But with the newspaper men, you can tell they really want to know who the Zodiac is, because the Zodiac is more than a killer, he is a enigmatic mind, and becomes to them a never ending game , forcing their own brains to rise to the challenge of his Zodiac puzzle. Like i said it is a classic , a modern classic. There are not many films made of this standard today,,,,,,,,,,, 10/10",Zodiac
547,frenchjuice,David Fincher at His Finest,9,25 August 2016,"I have said time and time again David Fincher tops the list for my favourite director. His methodologies are very unusual and his style is very distinct but sometimes I get perplexed by this fact: I do not love his movies. Among my top 5 movies or even top 10 I did not have any Fincher films in the list. While I respect his skills as a director and his unconventional perfectionism, all of his films are very ""fine."" I did enjoy and was intrigued by all of the films I saw from him, those being ""Fight Club,"" ""Se7en"" and ""The Social Network,"" however none of them truly resonated with me. Since those films top his best movie lists I believed that those films were the finest he had to offer. I was wrong.Zodiac, screened in 2007, is what I believe the best Fincher movie that I have seen. The plot is simple, people are trying to find out the infamous Zodiac killer, but the nuances and details make this movie utterly fascinating. Before each killings the movie would show the victim's lifestyle and the normality, none of the victims knew that they were going to be murdered that day and the movie shows that. Watching that portion makes one feel trapped, helpless like the victims as the murders take place. And Fincher does not hide, every stabs, blood, and wounds are shown, not because of gore for the sake of gore but to show what those murders were. Bloody, painful, unnecessary. The second act which delves into the investigation is one of the most intense act in a movie. Each scene gives us new clues and the following scenes loses one or two leads. In the beginning we, like the investigators are confident that they will be able to find the killer, but as the movie progresses it is very unclear. The second act gives a slew of great characters that were acted spectacularly, the almost twitchy Graysmith, the fun Avery and weary Toschi all are fleshed out with details by Jake Gyllenhaal, Robert Downey Jr and Mark Ruffalo, as well John Carroll Lynch gives a standout performance as Arthur Leigh Allen, one of the prime suspect. While the second act is filled with mostly talking and some may find that boring these actors with Fincher's direction makes for some of the most interesting dialogue scenes.The problem, and the only flaw that I found with this movie is the transition between the second and the third act. The second act had 3 main characters but the third act has only one, so when the movie narrows the focus down to the one person it lost it's ability to switch characters when a story arc becomes dull. Fortunately it picks itself up as Graysmith become more and more obsessed over the case, mirroring our desire to find the killer. As well narrowing the protagonist to Graysmith introduces a feeling which we haven't felt since the first act ended, fear. Here, we have one guy, not an institution, but a cartoonist chasing down one of history's most infamous serial killer. It's spine tingling, it's on the edge of your seat, it's Fincher. While researching this film I was shocked at how small of money it had made: about 80 million, compare that to Fincher's recent ""bomb"" ""The Girl with The Dragon Tattoo"" which made more than $230 million. Initially I thought way more people should see this movie but perhaps it is because of it's underrated status that I was fully able to enjoy the movie, as I knew the endings of both ""Fight Club"" and ""Se7en"" from multiple sources. Don't worry dear readers, I shall not spoil them here. With not knowing the ending I was able to fully enjoy the movie from the beginning to end and I know that I will revisit this movie sometime in the very near future.",Zodiac
548,cj_685,"Great, just a tad long!",8,10 June 2007,"Firstly i know nothing about the actual events this was based on so i am one of the people who went to see this movie purely as a film! Also, i decided to give it 8 instead of 9 out of 10 just because it started to drag and possibly was a little bit too long for me! The story of the Zodiac murders is interesting, intriguing and well told! It is very much a crime/mystery/thriller movie, but it also has a couple of funny moments and of course has the horror elements surrounding the actual murders! For those who are squeamish, FEAR NOT, it isn't really graphic or cringe worthy! Right, the acting! Great! Gyllenhaal does a great job at portraying the slightly bookish yet appealing young cartoonist Robert Graysmith, as does Robert Downey Jr. as the possibly, slightly eccentric Paul Avery! As i mentioned at the beginning it is quite a long film as it's stretched over a very long period, but i think it's dealt with so that there is usually something to pull you straight back into the story after the passing of a period of time! Personally, i think you would only REALLY enjoy this movie properly if you especially like this type of film because the length issue may cause problems! Definitely one for watching when you're in the mood, but definitely a must-see and fans of both Downey Jr. and Gyllenhaal shouldn't be disappointed! I'll definitely get it sometime when its released on DVD!",Zodiac
549,NumeroOne,As interesting and as tedious as a thirty-year unsolved case,6,1 August 2007,"*This comment may contain spoilers, but I tried to be as vague as possible, and I think that this movie actually improves if you more or less know the ending.*When David Fincher's ZODIAC opens with the year ""1969"" on the screen, a colorful wide angle shot of California, and a song from ""Hair"" on the soundtrack, we think we know what we are in for: an atmospheric historical epic. Then the film's first murder happens, and we are at the San Francisco chronicle with Jake Gyllenhall and Robert Downey, Jr., just recognizable enough under their period garb.We see three other murders or almost-murders within the first 1 1/2 hours of this 2 1/2 hour movie, and they are terrifying in a way that few movie murders are: this is one of the only movies that succeeds at making you identify with the victims, and the murder scenes contain enough gore to be convincing but not so much gore that it becomes its own aesthetic, as in other Fincher films.But ZODIAC is so long that eventually, the murders fail to keep our attention. The movie makes so many leaps through time and recounts so many investigations that lead nowhere, it is easy to forget that it began as an exciting movie.One could easily argue that the movie has a right to be so uneventful because it is a ""realistic"" reflection of police procedure and of, well, reality. It is, but one can't help but think, With all the time-lapsing that goes on (it constantly jumps months ahead in the late '60s and early '70s, and then jumps from '73 to '77 to '83 to '91), why couldn't it skip more boring parts? The movie manages to be both too truncated and too thorough.On a positive note, the digital cinematography by Harris Savides gives the film a consistently interesting look, which is something that many better movies don't have. He gives the film the signature ""Fincher"" look: saturated pastels in the daytime and a vague yellow-green tint at night. The movie is visually interesting without being calling too much attention to itself, but it's a shame that there's not enough to watch. The actors are sufficient, but the movie has no protagonist and we don't get to know anyone well enough - not even Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhall), who becomes the de facto main character half way through.The friendship between Graysmith and Paul Avery (Robert Downey, Jr.) - particularly a bar scene in which Graysmith introduces Avery to the merits of girly drinks - is interesting enough, but when Avery ceases to be a major character, we don't get enough of an indication that Graysmith has a life outside of his obsession with the Zodiac case. That may have been the point, but it doesn't work: there is nothing wrong with a plot that goes nowhere if the characters manage to hold our interest, but they don't hold our interest for all 2 1/2 hours, and the movie itself seems to lose interest in Graysmith towards the end. ZODIAC has no pay-off, which wouldn't be a problem if it weren't such a plot-driven film.Still, it has its moments that nearly redeem it. It's a bit like a friend who tells long and meandering but enthusiastic stories: once you realize that his stories will always be too long, you can focus on the better parts. But his stories are still too long.",Zodiac
550,hardrock666,There's more than one way to lose your life to a killer,9,3 August 2008,"Zodiac is one of those movies that might prove rewarding to the patient viewers. The movie is about three hours long and is based on the 1986 book ""True Crime"" by Robert Graysmith (played by Jake Gyllenhaal) about America's most sinister unsolved crimes: the San Francisco Bay Area serial killings by a person called Zodiac.In it's style and presentation it almost seems like you are watching a long episode of Cold Case and is quite unlike David Fincher's previous movies (se7en, Fight Club). This subtle,straight forward and no frills approach could be a let down for some people. It is also not a movie that would be suitable for any kind of mood. I want to say it's similar to Shawshank Redemption in that it takes its time to develop and grow over you, however its not that rewarding, because of the fact that the killer never gets caught. It does narrow down to one suspect, but the investigators could not find enough evidence to nail him.The movie spans a period of around 22 years starting on July 4th 1969 with Zodiac shooting Darlene Ferrin and Michael Mageau, who we later find out were very critical to finding the killer's identity or at least narrowing it down. In August 1969 the Zodiac letters begin to arrive. The first three are sent to Vallejo Times Herald, SF Chronicle and SF Examiner. The three letters had one part of a cryptogram each which according to him contained clues to his identity. He also took credit of the murders in these letters. Soon after these letters appear, four men go on his trail, a self-destructive ace reporter Paul Avery (Robert Downey Jr.), highly intelligent editorial cartoonist Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal) and the homicide detective David Toschi (Mark Ruffalo) who is accompanied by his partner Bill Armstrong (Anthony Edwards). These four independently and sometimes working as a team gather tons and tons of circumstantial evidence and get so obsessed with catching the killer that it takes a toll on their personal lives. Ultimately David and Robert come very close to proving that Arthur Leigh Allen (John Carroll Lynch) is the real Zodiac, but there is no solid proof to their belief. However since the movie follows the book and findings of Robert Graysmith very closely so as an audience our perception is a bit skewed towards who Graysmith thought was the real killer. There were so many loose ends to this case that the case is still open in few Northern California counties, however SFPD shut the case down in April 2004.The tag line of the movie ""There's more than one way to lose your life to a killer"", is very appropriate to the way each character is shown to throw away his life in the quest of Zodiac. It is in this aspect that the movie excels, however if you are expecting a thriller you'll be disappointed. There are few scenes here and there which create suspense, but they are few and the movie feels like a slow burn than an explosive suspenseful thriller. The direction is awesome for the kind of movie Fincher wanted to make and he recreates the 60s and 70s San Francisco successfully. However we've seen him make Se7en and Fight Club so something like this seems very ""normal"" for him to do and normal at times can be boring.In terms of performances, Jake Gyllenhaal excels in the role of a geeky cartoonist who comes to life when he gets obsessed with the case. Robert Downey Jr. is funny and likable. It almost seemed that he was playing himself in the movie. Mark Ruffalo after starring in a few romantic movies, gets to showcase his acting prowess and he does a remarkable job as well. John Carroll Lynch as the prime suspect looks menacing at times.It's tough to be harsh on a movie like Zodiac where you can see that a lot of work has gone into this movie both in terms of direction and acting. The movie has an interesting story line and the fact that it is true makes it even more exciting. It's the approach which will ultimately decide whether you like the movie or not. For me it worked to a certain extent and I usually like watching movies like this on a DVD. So if you are like me you might want to wait for it to come out.",Zodiac

Suspects come and go; there is no clear build-up as to why they are suspects, and they remain suspects with no clear conclusion.
Yes, I know the reason for it is the story being based on real events. That means many suspects, and as we know, the killer has not been caught until this date. However, I feel that the movie should've been a mini-series with an episode in each direction to cover this story appropriately.",Zodiac
553,billybobwashere,David Fincher yet again proves his brilliance as a filmmaker.,8,3 March 2007,"It doesn't matter whether you've seen all of David Fincher's films or none of them. He is a director who manages to take traditional storytelling and twist it so much that it becomes fascinating just to watch the plot itself progress, even if every single other thing about the movie is weak or poorly done. However, with his latest very eerie work, ""Zodiac,"" that is simply not the case. He is also a director who will never do the same thing twice. That doesn't mean that he just doesn't make sequels. If you were to watch two of his films, it would be nearly impossible to make any connections between the two in terms of style. He loves to shake things up and, despite having a large cult following, is willing to risk it all to do things the way he wants to.After a great wink-wink to the way that film studio logos have changed (he uses the old logos for the studios that were used back in the '60s instead of the more elegant ones used today), the film starts out with a very intensely filmed scene in which we are introduced to the way the Zodiac killer kills as he shoots a young couple that sits in their car. After this scene, the viewer will probably make the presumption that they know exactly what they're in for: a violent thriller that has a cops-versus-killer style and involves a lot of gunfire and killing. Think again.After hitting you hard with the opening scene, Fincher then takes an almost relaxed route in introducing us to two of our main characters, Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhal), a cartoonist, and Paul Avery (Robert Downey Jr.), a journalist, both of whom work for the San Francisco Chronicle, the news station gets a letter from a man who claims to be the man who killed two couples; one on July 4 (the one I described), and one on the previous Christmas. From this moment on, the rest of the film follows the lives of three men, Graysmith, Avery, and Inspector David Toschi (Mark Ruffalo) in their hunt to catch this Zodiac killer, and how it ultimately drives them all to madness.In the acting department, a terrific ensemble each adds to the film in his or her own way. However, the three main performances are in this case the three strongest. Jake Gyllenhal adds another strong performance to his résumé, which includes lead performances in ""Jarhead,"" ""Brokeback Mountain,"" ""Donnie Darko,"" and ""October Sky."" Mark Ruffalo is an actor who I have not been a big fan of in the past. Here, he brings both a sharp personality and occasionally quite funny wit to the screen as an inspector who is thrown into this whole mess near the middle of the story. But the greatest acting accomplishment of the film comes from Robert Downey Jr., who is nothing short of Oscar-worthy in his performance as a drunk and drugged journalist who owns every scene he's in (think Jack Nicholson in ""The Departed,"" but not as sadistic). His performance is not the largest in the film, but it definitely was my favorite.You'd think that a movie that was two hours and forty minutes long and doesn't feature any action or slapstick humor would have quite a hard time holding a viewer's attention. I don't know exactly how he managed it, but Fincher has such a natural ability to hold a viewer's attention regardless of what it is that's happening on screen that you are as entertained and interested by this as you would be by a ""Lord of the Rings"" film, minus all the fancy effects and silly hobitses. I wasn't alive when the Zodiac killings happened. It happened quite a long time ago (during the late '60s and early '70s). For me, it was a fascinating experience to see what was going on with California and how they were responding to this threat both in terms of its people as whole and its small fragments that tried to piece this whole thing together. For my dad, who was around at the time and aware of the situation, he loved watching a film that followed the three perspectives of three different people largely involved in a situation that he could only watch from afar. I have seen most of David Fincher's work (However, I have yet to see ""Se7en,"" which greatly upsets me). Although I think it is pointless to compare films that are so different in every possible way, I would rank this as the second best work that he has done, after the masterpiece ""Fight Club."" The reason that I found ""Fight Club"" to be a better film was that it simply had the opportunity to take more risks and do more things than ""Zodiac"" could, because this was based on events that actually happened, whereas ""Fight Club"" was a complete work of fiction.There are going to be a lot of great films that come out in 2007. However, if you truly consider yourself a moviegoer who plans on seeing the best of the best, David Fincher's exciting masterpiece ""Zodiac"" is a film that you definitely should not miss.",Zodiac
554,AfroThunder242,"An epic masterpiece, but too long and complex for it's own good",8,3 March 2007,"I loved everything about this film. From the soundtrack to the cast to the classic vibe presented when the opening credits rolled. I also loved the Dirty Harry element incorporated into the film. David Fincher has done it again. Most of this film is centered on the obsessions of a cop and a cartoonist trying to identify Zodiac over a period of 2 decades. It really is a shame this came out after the Oscars, because Jake Gyllenhal as well as Mark Ruffalo deserve nominations for their portrayals. The film runs just under 3 hours and can drag when jumping from one suspect to the next, but fans of Fincher as well as those who lived through this nightmare will appreciate the depiction for what it's worth.",Zodiac
555,user-11512,Disturbing and unfortunately Truth based,8,1 November 2007,"This movie was to as it was to many others: a blind sided shovel to the face type feeling. The plot itself is based on the real life Zodiac killer of the San Francisco Bay area. Throughout his career, Director David Fincher knows just how to jolt his audience into intense feeling relays. He combines soundtrack with certain actions and positioning of his actors. The murder scenes in this film are at the very least utterly disturbing and unnerving. I gave this film 8 stars because Fincher set out to tell this real life horror story and he truly achieved the paranoia, fear, and terror of this tragedy. Also on a side note, the Zodiac killer was never caught... Beware...But this movie is worth your time. Obvious comparisons will be cast to S.O.S. Summer of Sam however the change of location, type of murders, and lack of closure make these films very different despite the similar subject matter of two real life serial killers. I do not recommend this film for children or young adults due to the fact that this is based on actual true events and it cannot be deferred as just a movie but rather a portrayal on sick and sadistic acts on real people. I am a horror fan since age 3 and honestly its movies like this where they are fact base that terrify me, not fiction fables such as countless films in the slasher/occult genre such as The Birds, Friday the 13th, Alien, etc. Please go into this movie with the thought that this really happened and you'll fully weigh the total terror of this motion picture experience.",Zodiac

Definitely not the same old good guy versus bad guy detective story; and for that perhaps one could try to watch it.

558,ajsb55,Pretty Good,6,15 August 2008,This movie was pretty good. I haven't seen many of David Fincher's movies but I have seen Fight Club and Panic Room and this movie is almost just as good as those. It really should have earned more money at the box office and had more success than what it did have. The acting in the movie was good but not amazing and there were some parts in the movie that got to be a little long but other than that the script was great and there were some suspenseful parts. I would recommend watching this movie if you like crime and thriller stories. It isn't as violent and bloody than the other David Fincher movies so this would attract a different sort of audience.I can't wait for The Curious Case of Benjamin Button!,Zodiac

The fact that this is a real-life story makes me feel all this. I am not going to talk much about the movie, because otherwise I will have to give away major spoilers.

So if you haven't heard of the Zodiac murder cases, watch this movie right now if you want your head to be in delirium. I don't have to say much about the acting as we all already know how good Jake Gyllenhaal, Roberto Downey Jr., and Mark Ruffalo are as actors - they were all terrific.If you have no clue about the Zodiac murders, don't Google it; just watch the movie and feel incomplete - feel the urge to become a detective like I am feeling now.

560,beckwith10,Fincher Finally Delivers on the Promise of Genius,9,3 March 2007,"Fincher has finally made a genuine film for adults. Subtle, observant and lacking the sensationalist visual tropes of earlier Fincher films, Zodiac keeps its eye trained on the wonderfully humane and all-too-human characters that devote their efforts to solving the Zodiac killings. The true mystery, and what makes this film news, is not the exploration of the graphic carnage of the killer (which the film keeps to a minimum), but rather what motivates and compels those who would seek his capture. Finally, a film that explores the vulnerabilities, idiosyncrasies, strengths, failings, and ultimately, the decency of those who find themselves, however imperfectly, compelled to act in the face of evil. The film is beautifully cast. Even more wonderful is its quiet style. Indeed, Fincher hasn't merely made a film about the seventies, but has literally adopted the style of a seventies film, faithful to the rhythms of life in all its messiness, the sort of film a young Scorsese would have given us thirty years ago (and I wish would return to). Those seeking gratuitous violence, focus group mandated plotting, editing and telegraphed messages, keep wandering the halls of the multiplex. Fincher made this one for people who watch and care about real films.",Zodiac

For a serial killer mystery movie, what's so thrilling about it is that it defies all the typical Hollywood clichés for its genre, such as chases and blood & gore and sticks to the grounded reality tone with all the police investigative procedural work.

563,Scot6,"Engrossing Crime Drama, A Great Film Overall",10,3 March 2007,"I can't remember the last time I saw a movie in which I didn't want to miss a single frame. ""Zodiac"", an excellent film by director David Fincher fills that bill however. The movie is gripping and full of tension from start to finish even though the story of the infamous ""Zodiac"" killer of northern California is well known to many of us who lived through it. It is a completely fascinating crime drama, one which I think actually surpasses Fincher's noted ""Se7en"" in quality.For those who are unfamiliar with the story, this strange killer terrorized northern California during the 70's and late 60's and relied on cryptology as well as astrological symbols to further his reign of terror. Completely unrelated to another ""Zodiac"" killer who used similar astrological codes and stalked the New York City area in the early 90's, the story of the California ""Zodiac"" has found it's way into the annals of crime lore, possibly ranking up with such stories as the ""Black Dahlia"", or ""Jack the Ripper"" as one of the most noted unsolved crime mysteries to date.""Zodiac"" captures the look and feel of late 60's and early 70's San Francisco and Northern California, an era of the Patty Hearst kidnapping, ""free love"" and Ronald Reagen as California governor. As a ""period piece"", the film is remarkably authentic, capturing all aspects of that era down to the famous giant ""smiles"" on the now defunct PSA (Pacific Southwest Airlines) airplanes. It looked as if it actually had been made during the time period in which it was set, rather than almost 30 years later. The cinematography is excellent throughout and there are two particularly breathtaking shots in the movie, one of the valley around Modesto, California at night and another taken from the top of the Golden Gate bridge.""Zodiac"" in fact reminded me in both look, feel and attention to detail of another great thriller about the same era in US history, (albeit a political thriller in that case) the great ""All The President's Men"", by Alan Pakula. I found the ""Golden Gate Bridge"" shot in this movie to be very reminiscent of the famous shot taken from the top of the Library of Congress in Pakula's thriller and the entire movie details a similarly intense, relentless quest for the truth as in ""All The President's Men"".Fincher keeps the action taut, with a sense of underlying danger permeating the entire movie. While one might quibble with a few scenes here and there (for example, one scene where a woman and her baby are kidnapped by the Zodiac is never fully developed or it's outcome fully explained) the movie is particularly thorough in detailing the story. The acting is universally excellent throughout the film and Robert Downey Jr. is particularly good, playing a quirky, alcoholic reporter who faces the same type of demons that Downey himself apparently faced earlier in his life.One of the better crime dramas in recent years, I would highly recommend this film.",Zodiac

567,NightOwl0,A masterpiece,10,6 March 2007,"Zodiac is a masterpiece and I believe it is David Fincher's most accomplished film ever. I have never been fully enamored of either Seven or The Game. Fight Club was a feeble and ultimately mind-numbing shadow of a great book. Panic Room was an enjoyable technical exercise and not much more. With Zodiac I believe David Fincher has vaulted himself to the front rank of American filmmakers. The film is a richly textured and densely layered meditation on crime, celebrity, obsession and media manipulation. To call Zodiac a serial killer movie is to do it a huge disservice. This film is the work of a master filmmaker at the peak of his powers. I was delighted to discover a film where intelligent characters converse with each other in a thoughtful manner. This film requires and rewards attention. It is a rebuke to the obnoxious and annoying MTV style which will pollute theaters yet again on Friday when 300 comes out. The film looks great and is shot with a great deal of care and attention to detail. However, David Fincher's films always look great and this is not the area where this film really shines. This film really shines in it's understated, realistic and yet wholly entertaining dialog and characterization. Fincher has made the bold choice to take the time to create credible characters and to actually give those characters something to say. This is a film where how a character says something means just as much as what he or she says. Most films assign one trait to a character and then have that person behave according to that trait. The characters in Zodiac are complex three dimensional people. Fincher does not pander to the audience in any way. He does not ask you to even like anyone on screen, he just wants you to recognize their humanity. For a movie that is intensely dark and creepy it is amazing how funny Zodiac is. I actually laughed out loud during several points in the film. I never laughed once during Fight Club and that was a movie that seemed to be constantly trying to elbow you in the ribs. The humor is allowed to grow organically out of the characters and situations. Fincher has employed a consistently light touch for such heavy material. Extreme and pressured circumstances, like the ones these characters find themselves in, always breed dark humor. Fincher allows for this humor to come out and far from weakening the story it actually strengthens the tone of the film. For once Fincher allows his technique to serve the performances and the story he is trying to tell and not the other way around. The film avoids the nihilistic sensationalism of Seven by not allowing the audience to identify with the killer or get off in any way on his crimes. The murder scenes are swift, brutal and devoid of any sexy thrill. This is murder as ugly and heinous as the actual act. The ""serial killer as rock star"" idea is not indulged. This killer is a sad, pathetic and twisted individual with a disgusting pathology. This film is completely removed from ridiculous movies like Hannibal and Red Dragon, where the filmmakers seem to encourage the audience to identify with a psychopath. The individual characters come to pursue the Zodiac killer for many different reasons. Fincher, wisely I think, does not spend a whole lot of time explaining the psychological reasons that lead each character to become obsessed with the case. Again he gives the audience enough credit to trust them to observe and make up their own minds as to why these characters do what they do. Audiences have become lazy and very passive in their viewing habits. They expect everything to be explained to them and all of the work to be done for them. Viewing a work of art cannot be a passive experience. You cannot watch a film like Zodiac passively. The obsessive attention that Fincher lavishes on the production must also be employed when watching it. If you do not pay close attention you will miss important details that will ultimately make the film a much richer experience for you. Fincher has become a great actor's director. All of the actors in the film exhibit a joy of performance that only comes from working with a director who is willing to push them to do their best work. Fincher obviously expects nothing less than excellence. This excellence is very much in evidence in the many pitch perfect performances in the film. Special kudos should go to Robert Downey Jr. and Mark Ruffalo for their intelligent and subtle work. It is unfortunate that Zodiac seems to be fairing so poorly at the box office. Perhaps Fincher's fan base was scared off when they realized that the film was not going to be Seven 2. It would be a shame if Fincher turned away from the fascinating and thoughtful direction he seems to be going in. I wish there were more filmmaker's that had the guts to try and make big budget pictures with intelligence and care that are actually about something other than a marketing campaign. Zodiac is such a film. It is a movie that is thrillingly open and alive to the fantastic possibilities of narrative cinema.",Zodiac
568,pdlaker34,one of the best films of last year. underrated and extremely well made,10,3 November 2008,"David Fincher is such a great filmmaker technically, but this is his best film in terms of pacing, which in my opinion is one of the best ways to judge a director. Seven and panic room are paced like a Hitchcock film and fight club is paced like A Clockwork Orange(please don't think that I am implying that ACO is as good as Fight Club b/c it's not even close), but this is getting into new territory for him. This is his most authentic film in terms of the people in it. I love seven, i think it is a great film with 2 very good performances(Freeman & Pitt) and 1 great one by Spacey, but this is fincher's best film so far because all the characters fit into reel life really well and vary so differently. This film is said to be about the Zodiac killer, which it is, but it really is more of a newspaper and media film. In my opinion it is the best film involving a big story in the newspaper since all the president's men. I don't particularly love Gyllenhal in this, just because he is a little too much of a pretty boy and clean cut for this paranoid sort of looserish character (maybe Guy Pearce, Cillian Murphy, or even Peter Sarsgard and couple more would have been better), but he is certainly not bad at all and Robert Downey Jr., Ruffalo, Sevigney, and everyone else in this film pretty much give perfect performances for the material they are given. That one little miscast is made-up for by the perfect casting of every other part. This film is 2 hours and 42 minutes long, but it does not feel close to that because it keeps you guessing, you care about the characters through their development, and it is also is just entertaining which is a quality that some great films lack. This film is in my top five of the year and maybe top 3. The ending of the film is so poignant and perfect.I think this shows that David Fincher can have a complete career with films that evoke different emotions and after seeing this film I am really stoked for Curious Case of Benjamin Button. Fincher is now one of my favorite young American filmmakers because of his incomparable technical abilities next to spike jonze and because he can make thought provoking and versatile work as a director.",Zodiac
569,danroy70,Great who done it movie and based on true events!,8,23 September 2016,"Jake Gyllenhaal plays Robert Graysmith in this thriller and truly well-made film. I really believe this was a big stretch for Jake Gyllenhaal and a hard role to play and he does such an amazing job. As tragic and real as this movie is it is based on true events that actually happened in Northern Central-California area in the late 1960s and early 1970s. This film is obviously not a movie for the whole family but a film to remember and one that will wrack your head over and over when you think about it, just knowing how close they were to getting the guy who actually did it but just not enough evidence. Sadly many cases today go unresolved to similar issues. I won't reveal too much of the story but allow the incredible mystery to be revealed to you.

570,trypanophobic34,Interesting but not dark or thrilling,7,4 March 2007,"I'll make this short and sweet. Zodiac engrosses you in the case. You find yourself drawn into it and keeping up with all the details. It's not ""exciting"" or ""thrilling"" like a more horror-oriented movie on a similar subject might be, but engaging; not deliciously dark or psychological like Se7en, but rather very realistic and analytical about the investigation itself. The acting is great; as many other people have mentioned, Robert Downey Jr.'s performance is notable, very similar to his persona in Wonder Boys. All the characters are likable or at least not dislikable. You even get a feel for the first few victims. You should already know this, but the Zodiac is not a cultivated, cultured, intellectual killer like Hannibal Lector or Kevin Spacey's character in Se7en; so don't expect that romantic or intriguing aspect of the killer himself. The movie does not focus on him, anyway. What else? It's very '60s- and '70s-ish. With a lot of movies that take place decades earlier, it feels kind of anachronistic despite the costumes, surroundings, and overall efforts to make it feel of the period it takes place in. Zodiac really does seem like it's set in the periods in which it's supposed to.I can understand people being bored with it, but it was engrossing for me, at least, and should be for people who don't go into it wanting it to be a thriller or a highly fictionalized sensational story or anything like that. I don't think the trailer is misleading in that respect - it is obvious the movie focuses on the investigation.",Zodiac
571,Tazmanhomie,Just didn't do enough,4,5 July 2007,"Entering the cinema with no knowledge of the Zodiac killer left this whole thing as a very hollow experience. Two hours and forty minutes of what, for all intents and purposes, was little more than an unnarrated documentary, rather than a film. And balance was difficult for Fincher to achieve: eventually, the time devoted to the facts of the Zodiac case, and all that tedious police red tape and discussions about fingerprints and handwriting which may or may not have existed meant that the characters suffered. I got a reasonable picture of the Paul Avery and Dave Toschi characters, but none of the others - and to me, they weren't really characters interesting enough to transfer into a film anyway. Finally, while I am well aware that the case remained unsolved and so forth, for Fincher to deliver this and sundry information via six or seven faceless captions at the end of the film, after over two and a half hours of film, was a terrible cop-out. I was dissatisfied with the quality of this piece, and must learn to be more careful when considering films based upon real events.",Zodiac

583,Brubaker1971,"Yes, They STILL Make 'Em Like That Anymore.",8,18 September 2007,"Fans of David Fincher will be more than aware of his ability to tackle pretty much any genre of movie with style, skill and fluidity - Zodiac is no exception to this rule.At a running time of 2h30m, you are never without something to grasp hold of, mull over or contemplate - no mean feat for a movie that is handling a subject that as a rule not only appeals to a specialist audience, but is unpretentious in its approach to the matter itself.The shot sequences are superb as you would expect, the acting is played out to a rhythm rarely seen - but it's how the viewer almost 'becomes' part of a team (good or bad, you decide) is what separates this movie separates itself from the run of the mill, average 'good guy/bad guy' flick. Suspension of disbelief has never been more prevalent than in Zodiac, and when you're dealing with historical events that is an incredibly convincing accolade for the director.Speaking of history, one of the immediate things you will notice during this movie is the overall 'feel'. It's like the director found a time machine, took some high-end digital cameras back to the epoch that it all happened and made it re-happen. There was something extremely gritty and realistic about 'cop' movies from the 70's - Fincher has encapsulated that sense of realism here with, it appears, frightening ease - but with the astute awareness of a genuine 21st century director.Take all the best thrillers, the best cop movies from the last 30 years - you know, the stuff that you watched for the first time and thought; ""Wow. That was really something else."" - and with Zodiac, you will find that same feeling.While it's not a patch on fictional 'cop' movies such as Heat or Serpico (simply because reality doesn't allow it), Zodiac is a great example, nay - an inspirational example, of how the tried and trusted method of making a movie based on fact without having to exaggerate or fabricate anything for a cheap thrill is really done.If you're unaware of the subject matter, no matter. If you are, all the better. Fascinating and compelling stuff from start to finish, Zodiac is set (along with Fight Club) to go down as part of Fincher's finest works, and is testament to the age-old adage; ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it."".Many, many inspirations here, but most importantly Zodiac stands alone as a film about a true event in the best possible way - pulling you in from the very first moment, and leaving you with many, many questions of your own as the credits roll.Buy it, borrow it, hell steal it - if only for the scene that pays homage to ""Last House On The Left."" (say no more, those who have seen both movies will know what I'm referring to), it's worth every blood red stained cent.At 8.1 / 10, Zodiac falls just - and I mean just - short of Fight Club, but when you're trying to top a classic, it's hard to shine that ever loving light to it. Nevertheless, it's a gem and probably, arguably amongst the top 20 finest 'cop' movies ever made - and that in itself is something DF can be extremely proud of. Let's just hope his next movie is much more of the same.Great stuff.",Zodiac

And it's 158 minutes long. How can this work ?When someone like David Fincher brings out a new movie, it's crystal clear that I visit the cinema on the first night it shows in Germany. I love ""The Game"" and ""Fight Club"" as much as I shudder every time I think of ""Se7en"" (having the most vicious and psychopathic antagonist ever). So, yes, I am a Fincher fan.This movie, however, differs a lot from his earlier works. It is not so much ""in your face"", but more subtle and smooth. While there are scenes that frighten you (mainly towards the end of it) and scenes that disturb you (mainly at the beginning), the most part of it is dialog. Pure Dialogue, pure investigation. A rather slow speed, no action scenes, only a bit of brutality (and showed in a way, that the gore hounds don't get too much out of it).But somehow you aren't bored. The absurdity of the case unfolding in front of you, a brilliant script and very good acting by the main characters just keep you sucked in to the movie. It is a unique viewing, and thinking of movies that might be similar, only ""All the President's Men"" comes to my mind. Although, having watched that one lately, I have to say that Zodiac is a lot better.There are just so many layers to movie that it is hard to peel them off. On the first layer is the classic ""Who is the murder ?"" On the next layer is a harsh criticism of 2 of the three branches of the state, as well as the press as the so called fourth power. While the Executive obstructs Justice with it's haggle over competencies, the legislative situation makes it hard for the police to act and nail down the best suspect they ever come across. The fourth power, the Press, only tries to raise their circulation and happily follows the orders of the mass murder, investigates false links and publishes them, thus leading hundreds of false accusations and suspects that overburden the authorities and lead to right leads being drowned in a sea of false leads. And on just another next layer is Obsession. The obsession of the murderer, who wants to have slaves in his afterlife and thus kills people. The alcoholic and substance abusing journalist. And the caricaturist that becomes obsessed with the whole Zodiac case and wants to embrace and solve it, losing his family and job due to it. And on the other hand the policemen that fight against this obsession and don't want to be sucked in by the case and don't want their lives to be destroyed.All in all a brilliant movie, a must see, and probably a must-see-more-than-once.9 out of 10, only because there was a point after about 120 or 125 minutes where I thought: Oh my, another act, it is time to come to an end.

Everything about this film is phenomenal, from the performances, the screenplay, the production design, the cinematography, and the 70s noir score, everything is perfection. The film also succeeds in building tension and exceeding expectations, something you would expect in a biopic directed by David Fincher.My only nitpicks, however, is that some of the music choices felt a little awkward in some scenes and RDJ's performance took me out of the 70s setting because his portrayal felt too similar to Tony Stark, it was very distracting at times.Anyways, this film is a triumph, and I can't wait to watch it again.",Zodiac

Its a slog of a movie; great for serial killer researchers but far too long and at the end its a wtf? Film . Give it a miss unless you have too much time on your hands or your studying American criminology.,Zodiac
591,abhinav_cl,this is my favorite movie,10,16 September 2017,"i still watch parts of this movie every now and then, it still leaves a mark every single time. that's the magic it has. the amount of detailing with which this film is crafted is spellbinding, the movie is so well balanced with details and thrill that it doesn't bore me for one bit even though its runtime is almost 3 hours long. it just keeps me glued even after repeated viewings.Jake gyllenhaal gives one his best performances ever. mark ruffalo is almost perfect in his character. downey jr. does his job well too. I didn't find anything wrong with the portrayal of this story.for me its a benchmark for thrillers. David fincher you're a genius.",Zodiac
592,candy_flesh,Surprisingly suspenseful,10,2 March 2007,"I admit, I was skeptical that a movie could be made about a 10+ year long murder investigation with very few actual murders and no arrests. I was even more skeptical that it could actually be funny, which I'd read in a review was the case.All my doubts were for nothing, David Fincher has crafted yet another excellent film.Here's the best way I can convey how good it is. I'm seven and a half months pregnant. I did not go to the bathroom once, in the nearly three hours of running time.Wonderful acting, a really well done script that is true to the actual events and characters involved, a lot of dry humor which adds a much needed levity to an otherwise intense drama. The authentic dated look of the film serves to heighten the sense that you are watching real events that happened to real people.If you are at all a fan of true crime, this film is a must see.",Zodiac
593,iamkilgoretrout,"""This is the Zodiac speaking...""",10,2 March 2007,"I have been highly interested and engrossed in the Zodiac killer story for the last 5 years now and I can say, without doubt, that this is the best and most accurate telling of the story. The film presents numerous details that were unknown to me before seeing it. All of these facts and theories are thrown together in a way that strings the viewer along, you think it's someone, then you get new information and that person is no longer a suspect. Fincher really puts you into the life of a detective working on the case. You feel just as excited when new information comes about and are equally disappointed when it leads to another dead end.The film is beautifully shot (on VIPER digital cameras) and once again, Fincher shows us his wonderfully adept skills with CGI shots. All of the actors shine and truly become their characters. Jake Gyllenhall and Robert Downey Jr. put in excellent performances, as does Mark Ruffalo. I was also pleasantly surprised to see Phillip Baker Hall join the ensemble.The only complaint I have heard that holds any water is that the film is too long. At roughly 2 1/2 hours, I can see how many would think that is long, but you have to realize that this is an intricate story with deep characters who need to be examined and understood. A standard 90 minute film, or even a two hour cut, would not have been able to tell the story as well. Character motivation and important details would have been left on the cutting room floor.If you have followed the Zodiac case, you will be happy to see how well done this movie is. If you don't know anything about the case, you will be given an excellent story that will make you want to learn more about it. Regardless, you should do yourself a favor and see this movie. If nothing else, it's better than ""Wild Hogs"".",Zodiac
594,carped,Fincher misses the mark,4,8 March 2007,"6000 votes and 8.0 score!!! I can't believe that close to 6000 viewers were so entranced by this new Fincher's 2h50min opus. Or, maybe someone's been cooking the books here? Say, social-networking-style marketing ploy? Fincher has been highly regarded for his very stylish edge-of-the-seat suspenseful thrillers, like Fightclub, Seven, Panic Room. But here, he completely missed it. The script is beyond criticism. Suffice it to say that it's less than fascinating to watch Jake Gyllenhal's retarded character being obsessed with chasing the Zodiac mystery killings in SF, or Downey Jr. doing his trademark over-the edge persona just for the sake of it. And intended lack of traditional denouement is supposed to mean something, or isn't? The camera-work is top-notch, though. Kudos to Harris Savides for brilliant crane shots, and the 2-second shot of Golden Gate bridge in the clouds almost warrants the entry fee.",Zodiac

596,GrantTDawson,A must see.,9,22 June 2017,"""Zodiac"" is crime/drama film directed by David Fincher, and it was released all the way back in 2007. A decade ago! Dang, that is hard to believe. Anyway, I wasn't able to see ""Zodiac"" when it initially released in theaters and really I had never even thought about it until I saw it got added to Netflix this month. I immediately added it to my list and finally got around to watching it. ""Zodiac"" may not be as good as ""Se7en"", and it's definitely not the best crime/drama movie ever made, but it's still pretty damn good.PlotAs you might have guessed based off of the title, ""Zodiac"", the movie is all about the Zodiac killer, and the people who try to figure out the identity of the killer. I won't go too deep into spoilers, but if you were alive when the Zodiac killer was actually active or if you have read the book, you'll know at least some of the story. Essentially, there's a serial killer on the loose in California and he likes to taunt the press/police after he successfully commits a murder. The movie follows the detectives, a journalist, and a cartoonist as they try to figure out who the killer is. I wasn't alive during that time, and I never read the book or do any research on the subject. So this was a whole new story to me, and I feel like I benefited because of that. The entire time I was trying to figure out who the killer actually was. The director does try to throw a few curve balls at the audience, but I feel like they were almost unnecessary and actually hindered my final assessment of the film. Not that throwing curve balls at the audience is necessarily a bad thing, but the twists just weren't executed all that well.Anyway, the story kept me enthralled from start to finish. I was completely invested in the investigation by about the half-way point. I didn't look at how much longer was left in the movie once, and I even put off going to the bathroom because I did not want to pause the movie. That's how into it I was. One challenge that Fincher really overcame was the time line. This movie spans a lot of years. And sometimes that can harm a film dearly. Jumping weeks, months, years at a time can sometimes kill a film's momentum, and lose the audience in the process. But this movie doesn't do that. It can jump weeks or months and you'll hardly even notice. It never loses momentum and it never becomes a drag.Overall, the story of ""Zodiac"" is incredibly gripping and well done. Fincher does a great job of making a ""cold case"" into a movie that actually has a resolution that is satisfying, and he is able to make even the boring stuff seem interesting.CharactersAlmost all of the characters in ""Zodiac are great"". They're engaging, unique, and have great arcs. But Paul Avery, who is portrayed by Robert Downey Jr., is the weakest character of the entire film. I get that Fincher was a bit hogtied when it came to each character's arc, but man what a waste of Robert Downey Jr. His character has a pretty small role in the film in the grand scheme of things and doesn't actually add a whole lot to it. He drinks, he smokes, and he helps the case along a little but for the most part he's just there. And it gets to a point in the film where he's completely unnecessary, but they give him a few scenes anyway. I mean, ""Zodiac"" is a long film, so cutting out these excess scenes with his character would have trimmed at least a few minutes off of the 2 hour and 37 minute run time. But it is Robert Downey Jr. so I guess they didn't want to cut any of his scenes. Now, I want to make it perfectly clear that Paul Avery doesn't hinder the film or impact it in a negative way. He just doesn't add a whole lot to it and overall seems unnecessary. The rest of the characters are great, though.Potential Audience""Zodiac"" is a mature film. The first half of the movie contains quite a few murder scenes, and I would say that no one under the age of 16 or 17 should watch it. Heck, some people well into their 40s may find some of the scenes in this movie disturbing. It all depends on how much ultra-realistic violence actually impacts you. If you like crime, drama, or thriller movies you'll definitely have a good time with ""Zodiac"". Just don't let your young child watch it.Conclusion""Zodiac"" is a great film. The story is a quite the ride and the characters keep you engaged. The film does run a bit long, but because the story is so fascinating I doubt you'll even notice how long it truly is. If you have Netflix, go watch it as soon as you can. If you don't have Netflix, go rent it for a couple of bucks–it's worth it.",Zodiac
597,garethrleyshon,Killing Time.,5,20 March 2018,"Based on real events, Zodiac tells the story of a series of unsolved murders which took place in San Francisco in the 1960s and 1970s. The serial killer, know as the titular Zodiac, taunted the police with letters and ciphers sent to newspapers, but despite long investigation into the case, and several possible suspects, the true identity of the killer is still unknown to this day.Zodiac begins in 1969 and spans all the way through to 1991. While is historically correct in terms of the investigation and the prime suspect Arthur Leigh Allen, the substantial time frame offers up the films most problematic element. Choosing to highlight specific moments from the investigation, some of which happen years apart from one another, can make the film difficult to follow and leave the viewer feeling as though something is being missed out. And considering it spans 22 years, the characters appear ageless in appearance. One needs the name of their surgeons... Anyway, all the skipping ahead years at a time, means an awful lot is crammed in and leaves the run time at a hefty 157 minutes. A more concentrated study on a more definite event or part of the investigation perhaps would have made more engaging viewing. Instead too much, sadly equals too little.Perhaps my view would be different if one had read Graysmith's book beforehand. However, one didn't, so it is not.Graysmith's viewpoint from the San Francisco Chronicle is great however, and does offer something different than usual to the crime genre. Jake Gyllenhaal is fantastic as Graysmith, the man to becomes obsessed with the Zodiac, sacrificing his marriage and children to the cause. All consumed by solving the case, Gyllenhaal portrays this convincingly and empathetically and is surely the best thing in Zodiac, supported by Chloe Sevigny who give a superbly understated performance as his wife who takes second place to the Zodiac killer.Robert Downey Jr is occasionally funny but mostly irritatingly arrogant as the San Francisco Chronicle crime writer who sinks in to alcoholism. And Mark Ruffalo, while all good and hairy, is just a bit, well, meh.David Fincher clearly directs his cast members well, but on the other hand there is very little of Fincher's stylistic direction that was present in Fight Club (1999), nor the grit, grime and edge of Se7en (1995) aside from the odd fanciful piece of camera work.Perhaps that is it with Zodiac, there is no edge. The little tension that is built up at any one point is swiftly lost as we zoom years and years ahead to the next significant point in the investigation.There is some attempt at tone; the film occasionally offers a dark and atmospheric look at San Francisco in the 60s and 70s. The opening sequence for example is chilling, with the emotionless execution set against the 4th of July celebrations. Much of the time however, the locations are nondescript. Location should be a character in itself in a narrative such as this, but here she is pushed into the figurative background.There is a nicely played out underlying theme of addiction; the literal addiction of Paul Avery to alcohol and Graysmith's obsession with unmasking the Zodiac killer. The deterioration of both lives in different ways is contrasted nicely and effectively .BOTTOM LINE: Not exactly killer, Zodiac is hard going at times. Worth slogging it out for Jake Gyllenhaal's brilliant performance as Robert Graysmith though.",Zodiac

I've seen the film twice within three weeks and I was drawn in like a fish hooked in to a rod each time. It's basically about the Zodiac killer, and the deep effect the case had on investigators.Instantly, from the first scene, we know Zodiac isn't pulling any punches. The murder scenes throughout are meticulously recreated with such intensity and suspense. The tone is just right, making it disturbing and perfect for the film. The actors all play the fantastically written characters beautifully, and the movie has some of the most memorable dialogue I've seen in film.While it starts at a slow pace, Zodiac presents one of the most interesting stories I've seen in film, culminating in a cathartic ending. I believe it is a modern gem of cinema.",Zodiac
600,JagsFanJay,Was I the only one????,7,27 August 2007,"I found this movie a little troubling because by the end, they still couldn't figure this thing out, when the answer was right there all along. I couldn't be the only one that saw this, but the movie acts as though it never happened. Let me explain...When Robert Graysmith goes to meet with Bob Vaughn, he discovers that Vaughn was in fact the one who wrote the movie poster whose printing matched that of the letters send by the Zodiac to the newspaper. Vaughn then goes on to say that the Zodiac symbol could be the mark that is on the front of movie reels. He then leads him down to the basement where there are files and files of films and lots of things in storage. While Graysmith and Vaughn are in the basement, Graysmith hears someone upstairs, but Vaughn insist there is no one there. Later in the movie, everything again appears to revert back to Arthur Leigh Allen as the prime suspect as he was identified by a surviving victim as the shooter in the first murder. Does everyone see it now? There were actually two Zodiac Killers. Vaughn and Allen were working together. That is why Allen's writing samples didn't match the writing samples on the letters, because they were actually written by Vaughn. The two could have worked together to commit the murders or at the very least, Allen committed the murders while Vaughn wrote the letters. It was so obvious to me, but I wonder why the film just kind of blew off the entire Vaughn/Graysmith scene as though it never happened. Was Graysmith just too blind to see the obvious or did the notion of two serial killers just seem to outlandish to consider? We now know such a thing is rare, but it does happen as was the case with serial killers Henry Lee Lucas and Otis Toole. These two maniacs were homosexual lovers and confessed to the murders of over a hundred people between them, although many were unsubstantiated. Never the less, they were convicted of many murders and remain two of the most notorious serial killers in American history. Could Graysmith and Allen have had such a partnership? Why wasn't this idea even discussed in the movie? It was like Vaughn was considered as a suspect even though his handwriting was the closest match to the Zodiac letters. Could anyone help me out here?",Zodiac
601,Rolsrois,Well Fincher Has his way with murderers,10,20 September 2008,"The movie was really good, really good. i think the thing i liked the most was the camera work, really brilliant. Zodiac is a killer in the 60's - 70's in SF, CA. the movie shows Zodiac in a really creepy way, Jake is awesome, plays the one with the obsession to capture the Zodiac, he's doing his job better then i could imagine. Robert Downey Jr. is really cool, with his all ""i rule"" approach. Mark Ruffalo is with side wigs :D but he's great as a detective too. i've researched a lot about the Zodiac, so i had great expectations for the movie. i must say, i have absolutely no complain, Fincher has his way with Thrillers. really, if you're up for a good movie which will make your spine beat himself, after you've seen it, go see Zodiac.",Zodiac
602,bumble472,Shockingly incohesive and boring,3,24 March 2007,"I was pretty shocked that this film came from the same director of very cinematically gripping films such as Fight Club. Zodiac is not only boring, it's extremely incoherent. It feels like Fincher couldn't make any decisions and just had the editors go nuts chop everything to pieces.The movie starts out okay--the murder scenes, especially the opener, are pretty well done (the blood is quite reminiscent of Fight Club). Then as the film continues the scenes become shorter and as the Zodiac stops killing people, it's basically just Mark Ruffalo running around trying to catch the guy and then Jake Gyllenhaal running around trying to catch the guy. Jake Gyllenhaal is simply too young to play his character, Robert Graysmith, who doesn't age a day when he is supposed to have aged fifteen years. I also find it quite unconvincing that Graysmith doesn't seem to care when his wife ups and leaves with the kids. And the unexplained absence of him from the middle of the film is irritating as well.By the end, it felt as though Fincher had given up, a little. The average scene length is about fifteen seconds--no exaggeration--and they all basically consist of Jake Gyllenhaal running around, slipping and sliding in the rain, and basically being his goofy self. Especially with all the rain, it started feeling like I was watching The Day After Tomorrow, not what was supposed to be an exciting thriller about a serial killer. Too many characters are introduced as potential Zodiacs, and then abandoned. I'm sure this is how it happened in real life, but that all could have been cut out to shorten the movie's 2 1/2 hour length. This is a big blockbuster--the audience doesn't expect Fincher to include all the details. He did, however, and it felt extremely unnecessary. There are also way too many extra people, such as the guy who can only be remembered for playing Chandler's short-lived roommate, Eddie, on Friends, who replaces Robert Downey Jr.'s character. He's in it for a total of about four minutes, and just feels like an extra burden. Graysmith's marital relationship with Chloe Sevigny, as well, feels strange, and was clearly only included to have a woman in the cast--however horrible a job she did in terms of her acting.The one thing I did like, though, was the idea that the Zodiac was played by different men according to how the victims described him. That, to me, was an interesting way of doing things, especially because the case has never been solved, so we don't really know who actually did commit the crimes.Don't be expecting Se7en or Fight Club from this film. It's boring, too drawn out, and falls apart about halfway through. If you felt this review was too long, you'll never survive Zodiac, and if you already saw it, then I don't know how you did.",Zodiac
603,dazzlem,The one we've been waiting for!,9,5 March 2007,"David Fincher has secured his place in the first tier. The maestro drops his recognizable style, save a few remarkable exceptions, and focuses on performance and character. He allows some ugly muddy low light scenes that would send most perfectionists to the medicine cabinet. A little more light would of looked better, yes, but probably not as truthful to the actors and the ""vibe"" of the scene. The result is a 70's movie that looks and feels like a movie made in the seventies. Many people have tried to get that right and failed. Fincher pulls it off. He had help. The BEST cast in years. The list of developed, memorable characters is at least 20 deep, quite a feat even at two hours and whatever. And then there's the script...so good it makes me wanna puke. Smart, funny, crafted with great payoffs in every scene, at every turn.. except at the end, where closure would of made THIS movie unnecessary anyway. It's not about the poor sick creature that performed those murders, but his victims, all of them. Frightening. I suspect what was frightening for Fincher was turning his big moments over to the actors. As hard as they are to do, choreographed camera moves can be ""gotten right"". To get some of these scenes right (the interview of Lee at the factory) you need to catch lighting in a bottle. As great as the shot of The Pan Am bldg was, I keep thinking about Rufulo taking the tomatoes off his BLT. Bra-Efren-VO to all involved!",Zodiac

The graceful are the most endearing and to take part of that vision of any substandard is delicately enough for my peace. I congratulate your crew members Jake and friends on such a intrepid and vivid experiment in portraying facts in these movies. I almost also take in part the celestial bonding between each character in this movie. Though truly not insane I do note that I can be the only one to experience the gratitude of such a connection or celestial would not even be a word for existence. That comes around again and produces a awkward silence as to what was the real intentions. To what concern is the outcome.

606,Stevendcravens,Fincher is back and taking names,9,3 March 2007,"5 years since Fincher's last film. 5 years too long. He picked up projects and then dropped them. Finally he found a script that satisfied him. ZODIAC by James Vanderbilt. 2 years after I found out that he would direct ZODIAC and THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON back to back I walk in to see the first mentioned. It was fantastic. The cinematography on the Thompson viper camera was beautiful. The colors were great and the camera movements fluid. The acting from everyone is great. Gyllenhaal, Ruffalo, Downey Jr., Edwards, Carrol Lynch, and even Brian Cox and Philip Baker Hall were great with the screen time they had. The movie had old school Paramount and Warner bros. logos in the opening which made me smile, and the choices of music were spot on. Everybody on this movie did 110%. The detail to all the Zodiac's murders and clues was a major plus. This is definitely Fincher's most mature and well made film. Fight Club and Se7en are still preferred by me because I have seen both dozens of times and will continue to watch them. Se7en is my second favorite film ever made. the only thing i have a rough spot for is the length. it was incredibly long. I'm sure it could have been shortened a bit, but then again, I'm glad it wasn't. That is what happens when you have a director with final cut over his movie. Anyway, all Fincher fans should go see ZODIAC. All people who don't want to because of Graysmith's opinion on the case should see it too. This is truly a great film and worthy of your time. I can't wait to go see it again.",Zodiac
607,kooperthecool,Does the real Zodiac case justice,10,23 May 2007,"After watching a documentary about the Zodiac killings, my sister and i decided to go to the cinema last night a watch the film.I loved the way everything was set out to look like it really was filmed in the 1960's. The killings were done very well displaying almost complete factual correctness with the following exceptions:1) Paul Stine was shot in the right temple, no below his right ear 2) The taxi cab was found to be parked next to a fire hydrant 3) The executioners mask that the zodiac wears was square and hand madeI thought that the end of the film was perfect when Robert Graysmith looks Lee in the eye at the hardware store for at least 30 seconds. Just as he'd stated earlier in the film that he wanted to look zodiac in the eye and know it was him.Perfect.I also love how the letter with the word ""radian"" in was not analysed, as this was not figured out until years after the police received it.The zodiac case is one that intrigues me.

609,PaulyFidgets,Fascinating And Clever,10,12 June 2019,"For me personally, David Fincher's ""Zodiac"" is one of the best crime films of all time. I think it's up there with ""Silence of the Lambs,"" ""L.A. Confidential,"" ""Chinatown,"" and ""Heat."" Not that those films are really similar at all, but what I mean is that ""Zodiac"" is one of the best of the genre.You are probably aware that the Zodiac Killer stalked the streets of San Francisco from 1969 on into the '70s. Although Fincher's film does depict the Zodiac murders in disturbing, but non-exploitative, detail, the film is more of clue-sniffer/whodunit centered around real-life S.F. Chronicle cartoonist Robert Graysmith (Jake Gylenhaal) and his obsession with the case. The other major players are crime reporter Paul Avery (Robert Downey Jr.) and detective Dave Toschi (Mark Ruffalo).The film follows the twists and turns of the case in loving detail for a period of about 25 years. The film is beautifully edited, scored, and shot. It is smart and clever, and trusts that the audience is intelligent enough to keep track of the minutiae of forensic evidence. You feel like you are right there next to the characters, solving the mystery along with them. The only partially conclusive ending is haunting.There is only one (and pretty minor) flaw in the film: a red herring that makes the film lose focus for about 15 minutes. Other than that, the film never loses tension for 2 1/2 hours. ""Zodiac"" is a must-see for true-crime buffs or anyone with the patience to enjoy an old-school dialogue and character-driven crime drama. Highly recommended.",Zodiac

The movie makes you feel like it's boring but thats exactly Fincher wanted to!! He wanted to us feel the situation he tells straight to our face that this how it would feel when you have so many suspects from which you will have to find the murderer!

611,unreadpages,"Scorsese, Hitchcock? Not even close.",6,2 June 2007,"The film was touted as comparable with Scorsese, even Hitchcock! Sorry, but it didn't even come close. The director was at his best with the gruesome murder scenes which were certainly chilling, but as for how the long term ""cold case"" was dealt with, it was at times only marginally above television standard, and I marvelled at how the various parties in the film maintained their interest when I was losing mine. There were also annoying Hollywoodisms throughout, for example the unlikely manner in which the resignation of one of the investigating cops from the homicide squad was announced to his buddy, which was timed for screenplay drama, not for realism. The characters were packaged and there was a high level of predictability in their development and behaviour.There was little intellectual or spiritual fodder in this film. However it wasn't terrible, hence the 60%.",Zodiac

Does everything right up until the spine chilling last line. If I didn't prefer other films that are similar to this I could score it higher but the main and only real bad thing I have to say about it (except from a couple personal preferences) is that I personally think other films have done it better or at least in a way I prefer. Still really good film.",Zodiac

In the case of a murder, for example, the questions that one must ask are: When did the murder happen, in which location, what was the method the killer used, if possible, who was the killer and finally the motives that drew him in doing this action. In Zodiac, Fincher explores all the possible scenarios, from all the possible angles, from all the possible perspectives of everyone involved. His search is thorough, strict and to the bone. Nonetheless, the director deliberately refuses to directly encounter the motive of his invisible monster. Why did the Zodiac kill? ""This is the Zodiac speaking.""In a world where Evil is predominant in every aspect of the modern life, the director dictates to his viewers that the why doesn't matter anymore. The modern Man has come to terms with the sick, the twisted, the wrong, the unjust and the morbid in his everyday life. There is no surprise that the Zodiac murders happened, it is simply enough to eliminate any possible (bureaucratic or not) procedure to catch this murderer, no matter if along the way an entire city, an entire country, an entire society looses sight of the ultimate goal: Catharsis of the soul. No one wants to look in his own closet to find the dusty skeletons, no one is ready to look in his own mirror, no one is prepared to accept the fact that this killer is a product of the society he built for his children to grow up into. But the film, bitter to the end, offers no illusions: In a cyclone of information and evidence (lost and found everywhere in a dead end game) this society has long left the green, green grass on the one side of the white fence and now carries on in a land where the only possible breakthrough is to make it until the next morning, and the next, and the next The characters that Fincher chooses to illuminate his enduring drama of the human condition are forgotten in an endless twister of data. Lost, as is deliberately, the viewer him self, cannot find an exit and the only thing left to do is slowly but steadily to self-destroy. Carriers and marriages collapse, children are left without fathers, women are left without husbands and the entire American way of life is put aside; only one thing matters now for the grey figures that represent the final descent of modern society into total darkness: Obsession. For two and a half hours an incredibly built scenario manages to make the viewer think of all the possible details that are presented before his very eyes. In this way the cunning and tragically ironic Zodiac achieves its purpose: Forget your emotions, forget your feelings, forget your humanity; this is the real world: numbers, dates, data, TV announcements, news broadcastings, newspaper articles and all this to let you know that you are no different from the three crusaders that utterly fail to their task (to fight for a beautiful world, that is simply not there). The world of the Zodiac is our world and the fortunate ones will make it to the next morning, feeling happy for them selves. As for the unlucky ones, the only dream left is that of the remembrance of a once bright, innocent and joy full era, maybe they read about it somewhere or someone told them it existed once. After all, they will have plenty of time contemplating about these things as they gaze the endless rainy grey of a never ending dusk of a dying world.",Zodiac
614,fable104,Overrated...,6,10 March 2008,"At the end of last year when influential movie reviewers such as A.O. Scott from The New York Times were picking their top films of the year Zodiac was at the top of their list. So I finally watched Zodiac (not The Zodiac, I had made that mistake before) and I was disappointed. The cast was great and the acting phenomenal. The film was beautifully shot. You can feel the suspense as the Zodiac killer tracks down his victims and brutally murders them. But it was so long. Few films should be more than 2 hours (Godfather and a few other classics make the list) and this is not one of them. After the first hour and a half, the film felt endless and dragged on to boredom, just like the original Zodiac case did. So much of this film could be cut. We got it already, Jake Gyllenhal becomes obsessed with the case, there is no need overplay it for another forty five minutes.",Zodiac
615,grh83,Better than any movie nominated for the Oscars last week,10,3 March 2007,"I usually don't comment that often on this sight, but after seeing Zodiac last night I really felt I needed to. I have not seen such a mesmerizing, wonderfully written, wonderfully acted, wonderfully paced film in a long time. I was in a theater in NYC and for 3 hours not a single peep came from the audience. It was something I have never experienced before. Everything about the film was truly exceptional. The way the pieces kept falling into place and then when you thought they had it someone walked over and kicked the puzzle to bits. The scene in the basement was beyond tense and thrilling. That one scene was more unsettling and haunting than any horror movie I have seen in the past 5 years. I don't have too much more to say other than the fact that this is an all around masterpiece of a film and one that shouldn't be missed. I will admit thought that the length of the film may not be for everyone, but I assure you if you relax and give yourself over this wonderful picture you will see a movie that is far better than any of those that were awarded last week at the Oscars. Zodiac is the best picture of 2007 so far and I hope this is a sign of the year to come that outstanding Oscar caliber films like this are being released in March, hopefully we're in for a great year for film.",Zodiac
616,llanley93,Great Movie,10,9 May 2007,"What a well crafted picture this is. Even from the trailer alone, this film draws you in. It wraps you with the experience of living when and where the zodiac killer was active and at large. It is shot perfectly and the story is gripping.The jarring scenes shot around the killings reinforce in the viewers' minds the kind of horrific acts these were. And although they lend a level of emotional depth to the film, they aren't the heart of the story. It mainly revolves around the lives of the people trying to solve the murders. It shows the job becomes their obsession. The undertaking becomes all-encompassing, devastating to their careers, families and lives.The movie is presented as a thriller and comes through, building mystery and suspense where it intends. But more accurately, it is a crime/drama. It shines most showing the behind the scenes workings that were never common knowledge during the events. The truths sometimes are frustrating for the audience, who are viewing the seventies situations with three extra decades of expectations. This is a great thing.The performances are great. Each was outstanding in its own way, and none overpowering, rather complementing. In a rich and talented cast, the focus was on Ruffalo, Downey, and Gyllenhaal who all delivered some of their best work.",Zodiac
617,ipekbay,very successful,8,30 May 2007,"I went to the movie trusting wholeheartedly to David Fincher and back home very satisfied. In that rush of events, the chaotic and bureaucratic atmosphere, you never feel like losing the sight, can easily keep track of all the pursuits. The emotional and also rational orientation toward to the crimes and the killer is very well balanced and acted by the significant cast and crew that enable you to get a good perspective on your own, even though the end is already known. It is not only a detective movie, but also has interesting personal intersections,such as the one between an inflated ego Robert Downey Jr. and Jake G., an example for lack of confidence. Every detail from the music to the kitchen utensils is dealt with great attention and consistent with the time periods. There are a few very disturbing sequences which attract your attention and give the sense that you are watching a real story. Very successful!",Zodiac
618,jeffreylubeck@hotmail.com,Using the Facts to Create a Pleasing Crime Thriller,7,3 March 2007,"Zodiac, David Fincher's film about the impact the San Francisco Bay Area serial killer's case had on three primary characters is delivered with great attention to detail and proper pacing. Zodiac is not a film that uses or relies on suspended disbelief to succeed and does not attempt to compress five years of story into one in order to keep viewers interested. Instead it relies heavily on the facts and uses all of its 158 minutes to present them in almost linear form and staccato fashion.Set primarily in San Francisco in the late 1960's and 70's (and eventually the 80's) Fincher's Zodiac takes no artistic license by adding the obligatory car chase scene down Russian Hill, drug enhanced evening in Haight-Ashbury or conspiracy oriented behind the scenes moves by City Hall. Instead the audience is presented with a credible story that portrays how stress, tension, frustration and fascination play upon the lives of S. F. Police Inspector David Toschi (Mark Ruffalo), S.F. Chronicle Editorial Cartoonist Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhall), and S.F. Chronicle reporter Paul Avery (Robert Downey Jr.). Each of these people, as well as those surrounding them are operating well within the confines of every day life and the establishment. Fincher does not let Zodiac wander outside its central story, and therefore no editorial comment about the Vietnam War or similar events of the day are offered. Insights about the impact on the victims (who survive) or their families are only touched upon if they remain central to the story.The initial scenes of the movie depict the killer in operation and they are not sugar coated. However, viewers wanting to see a film in the style of Fincher's Alien (3), Se7en or even Fight Club (i.e., blood and gore to almost surreal levels) should look elsewhere.Zodiac is a well crafted production on all fronts. In addition to Fincher, the lead actors and extensive (and well known) supporting cast Zodiac producer's assembled a credible team. James Vanderbilt (Screenplay), David Shire (Score), Donald Burt (Production Design), Keith Cunningham (Art Direction), Victor Zolfo (Set Direction) and Casey Storm (Costume Design) all deliver quality work in their respective areas. There are no weak spots in this film. Zodiac may not (or attempt to) dazzle, but it does please.",Zodiac
619,daphunkofs,Excellent movie!,10,19 December 2007,"This film is extraordinary. If you like the cinematography of 'Seven', you will like this as well. I find David Fincher's directing skills remarkable and 'Zodiac' is a movie full of excellent acting, great editing, great music score, and a great cast. Jake Gyllenhaal does an amazing job in his role and so does Robert Downey Jr. But the performance that really caught my eye was Mark Ruffalo. His role as the lead detective was a perfect role for him because he really brought intelligence and emotion into his character. I'll be honest, the movie is pretty long, not action packed, and not very gory. However, that shouldn't matter because I think the acting, directing, and editing gave this movie depth. The story is based on the actual events and documents of the Zodiac case so its not gonna be completely fiction nor will it be like those lousy Hollywood horror, slasher films. This is one of those thought-provoking films that will keep you on the edge of your seat. But like I said, I warn those who expect an actioned packed film. The movie is not dragging and its not hard to understand the dialogue but the pacing is very moderate so there isn't a part where all the interesting scenes are in one segment of the film. I recommend this movie for those who like enigmatic films and are intrigued by the Zodiac story.",Zodiac
620,snow-mblu,Such a great cast... Such a great waste...,5,23 July 2008,"I came to see this movie with great expectations, after all it was a David Fincher's movie with an unbelievable cast! I was so disappointed...The actors play their roles wonderfully! Jake Gyllenhaal, Mark Ruffalo and specially Robert Downey Jr. But there is no character development.But where Zodiac fails the most is in capturing the viewer. The movie is too long, and the story is told in a way that it won't make you hold on to your chair hoping to see the case solved, as any good detective story will. Most of the public will hope the case is solved so they can stop watching the movie as soon as possible, because unfortunately, it's boring! It isn't exciting or troubling as a thriller should be...This movie had the potential of being really good, it's unfortunate that it fails so much!",Zodiac
621,forty_7,Fantastic!,8,1 March 2007,"While lengthy (this is the main downside of the film), ""Zodiac"" was truly a sight to behold. Fincher creates a very absorbing, tense, and ultimately paranoid film that will creep the hell out of you after you've left the theater...as long as you can keep the first hour and 45 minutes in mind.I enjoyed NOT seeing anyone in the role of the Zodiac, having him be a mystery to me (not that the film really tells you with 100% certainty who-done-it in the end), but perhaps Mr. Fincher found this to be far too similar to ""Se7en"" - I'm not sure. I can also see why some would call all the inter-weaving characters confusing, and in some places unnecessary, but everyone (even...gasp...Mark Ruffalo!) turn in great performances.That being said, where Fincher succeeds with this film is building tension from start to finish. This utilizes the very real aspect that the Zodiac was never caught, and it is executed (no pun intended) extremely well.8/10",Zodiac

As a matter of fact about 1/2 the people at my cinema left without watching the ending. That's how bad this movie was. It went on and on and on and on and on and on and it kept going on till you practically couldn't take it anymore. It would jump 1 month, then 4 months, then 5 years, then 2 months, then 7 years!! way too much, OVERKILL!!!!! On top of that the movie was boring to begin with, the best part was the first 30 min and that's where it ends. I was very very happy when this movie finally ended :) If I were the producer I would've cut about an hour of the film and added 25 minutes of suspense. Then I think the movie would've deserved a 6-7/10 rating.",Zodiac
624,tman90,"Welcome Back, David Fincher.",10,2 March 2007,"Audiences have waited a while for a new piece of work from Mr. David Fincher and now that hiatus is officially over. Straying away from his style that earned him a 'cult' following, he brings out a new side to himself, some techniques not yet observed in his repertoire.ZODIAC feels like it was made by a perfectionist, everything flows so smoothly. The editing is pinch-perfect. Not only that, but Ficher shows that he is an actor's director as well, directing his cast into true life roles wonderfully. But the credit does not go all on to his shoulders. The actors have a lot to do with that themselves. Jake Gyllenhaal, who plays the author of the book of the same name, plays his character with an irresistible 'nerdi-ness' that is just fun to watch. Then it is amazing to watch Gyllenhaal transform that character into an obsessed wannabe detective, losing all focus and normal aspects of his life. Mark Ruffalo plays a humorous and overworked cop with incredibility. He really gets the job done. Downey Jr., however small his role was, plays on the screen with a witty insanity that brings most of the laughs of the movie. The acting really is a major pro. ZODIAC may come out at a long time slot but the viewer will never realize it because of the film pulling one in, and not wanting to leave until the case is solved. That is why ZODIAC is fantastic and a great welcome back gift from Fincher to not only his fans, but to everyone. ZODIAC is definitely the best film of 2007 so far.",Zodiac
625,mynamehere1212,Solid,8,4 March 2007,"I will start by saying I was previously interested in the story of the Zodiac killer, because I thought that the story was extremely...interesting. This movie piggybacks on the strong story, and stretches it to its fullest. Now I mean the stretching bit in multiple ways; 1. They take opportune moments in the story to add a sense of humor (very often they do this), which keeps the movie from being one long tube of death 2. It sort of becomes a long tube of death. This is a mainly wordy movie, as it shows investigators tracking down even the dead ends, and is a lot of desk work 3. They develop each and every end, dead or alive. They work on the odd characters involved in the fiasco to make it interesting. This also can make it confusing at certain transitions, but it picks you back up soon enough 4. Following all of the dead ends drags out the movie to a startling 2 hours and 40 minutes of pleasure. So be warned. Now, coming out of the numbering system, I will comment on the commonalities and what not. Overall, the acting is pretty solid, although there are a few loose ends. They accurately capture a morbid, dreary mood of frustration which won't let go. Directing was decent. Scenes were lopsided, I mean that with the timing and rising and falling actions. Overall-its a great story that is well done and needs to borrow your time to enjoy it.",Zodiac

It is quite scary to see the events. Besides, the guy wasn't caught by the police. Maybe he's still out there. Jake's character is supposed to be the only person who knew the identity of the killer.

Even if the pace of the movie can make you feel disinterested maybe because this is true story hence all the sequence are real life inspired. So loved attention to detail by David Fincher. Its pretty interesting to see even how small mistakes can lead to a disaster.

Then if its is true, you've a same way of think with me before I saw this movie, and you would exactly change your mind after you see this movie!!! I've to declare that although it was based on true story of that notorious serial killer and directed by the director of se7en and fightclub (David fincher)and rex reed, the new York observer said ""one of the darkest, creepiest and most tantalizing thrillers I've seen in years"", It worth nothing for me! well, actually robert downey Jr played the character of that mad reporter greatly and jake either, but still, the plot was so boring. Too many unimportant scenes that should be deleted! Although the genre was thriller, horror. You'll not feel like you see a thriller but drama, Dark, creepy, stunning, should be replaced by wearisome, boring and ridiculous. And the worst of all is the music!

631,jee-devraj,Purely Fincheristic,7,13 December 2011,"An intense, albeit slow, telling of the story of the Zodiac killings, this movie transports its audience back to the 60's and 70's, and makes them relive the tension and paranoia that shrouded the lives of the public back then. The Zodiac Killer was active during those days, a serial killer who would leave codes and mail ciphers and letters to the newspapers, gloating over his kills. It follows the story of the young cartoonist Robert Graysmith, played by Jake Gyllenhaal, for whom hunting down the Zodiac became a morbid obsession and remained so long after the case had gone cold and the police had stopped hunting him down. It also follows the lives of Inspector Toschi (Mark Ruffalo) and Paul Avery, the first journalist to take an active interest in the Zodiac killings (Robert Downey Jr.). The film-makers have shown as accurate a picture as possible on celluloid, basing their stories on the book by the real-life Graysmith. This is a must-watch for all those who love the crime- thriller genre. It has an ending that leaves the audience wanting to believe something, but not being sure.",Zodiac
632,lisa_thatcher,David Fincher's Masterpiece,10,5 October 2014,"Zodiac is, without doubt David Fincher's masterpiece and unbeknownst to everyone at the time, it will become the benchmark for all future Fincher films. It is the perfectly realized balance of a fine script, brilliant performances, technical acumen and above all an implacable restraint that is made all the more potent for the films one hundred and sixty-two minute length. All the problems with Se7en (still a great film) are obliterated in Zodiac, a far more difficult film to ""enjoy"" mostly because of the enormous cerebral pressure it places on the thinking viewer. The themes here are large: American obsession with serial killers, media interference in police procedure, pulp fictions obsession with true crime, the attention to detail of the obsessive, the reflexive nature of societies imaginations, the costs of obsession, the effects of time and memory on history, etc. If Fincher refused to turn the camera on his audience in Se7en, he does so with a cool calculated gaze in Zodiac, a film that rarely wavers into Fincher's characteristic flounces, such as helicopter shots or ambient police torch-light. Much of Fincher's integrity comes from a clear intention to tell the truth of the story, possibly because it is the first ""true story"" film Fincher will make, and his intention to avoid glamorizing the serial killer as he did in Se7en. By keeping so close to the facts of the story, by retaining a self consciousness about the end product, the meticulous perfectionism that characterizes Fincher's directing style becomes the perfect vehicle for a long drawn out film about obsession on details.Zodiac's opening scene is a fine example of the films merits. With Three Dog Night's lilting cover of 'Easy To Be Hard' wafting, the scene is of Vallejo, California on the fourth of July, fireworks bursting over the city. Darlene Ferrin (Ciara Hughes) is on her way to pick up Mike Mageau (Lee Norris), but the camera examines the houses celebrating fourth of July from her eye as she drives. When she drives Mike to a secluded lovers lane, another car approaches and although Mike wants to leave, Darlene claims everything is alright and doesn't make a move to drive away. Donovan's haunting 'Hurdy Gurdy Man' comes over the radio and increases as The Zodiac steps out of his car and shoots the pair. It's the scene that will become the defining murder leading to a suspect by Robert Greysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal), the cartoonist at The San Francisco Chronicle who becomes obsessed with solving The Zodiac's puzzles and then the murder itself. Opening the film with the murder that causes the films denouement is not only clever writing, it also speaks to the fascination of the Zodiac obsessives. Fincher makes a film that the obsessives will love, even as he casts a shadow over the costs of that obsession. Greysmith, the writer of the two books the film is based on, is an obsessive, and James Vanderbuilt's decision to base the story on the fanboy who writes the books rather than the story of the killer is all the more powerful because it includes the detectives working the case as complicit in that obsession. If Greysmith becomes preoccupied because he loves puzzles and can't prevent himself from falling down the rabbit hole, then even more chilling is the fate of detective Dave Toshci (a soft- spoken Mark Ruffalo) who becomes haunted by association. Both men are reflected in characters who represent an alternate choice, Paul Avery (Robert Downey Junior) who sinks into depression and substance abuse against Greysmith's vigilance, and William Armstrong (Anthony Edwards) who voluntarily gives up detective work altogether because of the impact on his family against Toshci's being demoted and barred from the case for sending his own Zodiac letters. All four men will be ruined by their obsession with Armstrong as the only one who escapes. Fincher inserts wonderfully understated images to reflect this obsession, such as Greysmith, alone in his apartment filled with files about the Zodiac case after his family have left him, flicking through his newspaper clippings chillingly preserved in a family photo album.The film works within the obsession, becomes the obsession if you like, making itself another media representation of what it is seeking to expose. The Zodiac killer played with the media, using it to enhance his notoriety. From the badges Paul Avery has made that everyone wears that say ""I'm not Paul Avery"" through the comment William Armstrong makes to David Toshci when Avery supposedly discovers the Zodiac's first victim, ""It's very real. You know how I know? I saw it on TV,"" to the incredible collection images used in the montage of media lettering and zodiac puzzles sliding and moving over the top of the detectives trying to do their job. This obsession with representation through the lens makes the Zodiac a different serial killer, a modern serial killer, and this becomes Fincher's second film that points to a problematic relationship with the camera. The Zodiac is never caught, which is interesting seeing as he calls famous people regularly, sent letters to the press, and forged personal relationships with the people obsessed with catching him. In Panic Room, David Fincher told us video surveillance becomes a self-cogitating nightmare, the lens always pointed back at us. In Zodiac he uses the media and film in the same way, revealing a relationship with technology that uses us more than we make a use of it.",Zodiac

As it turned out, pretty much everything.The movie starts off strong, and the quick sequence of murders, cyphers to the police in the first 30-40 mins of the film had me hooked. But everything went downhill from there onwards. The random time stamps soon had me confused as to what was happening when and where.The movie is unnecessarily lengthy. Paul Avery's initial obsession with the Zodiac and his eventual downward spiral is well captured, only to be treated with Robert Graysmith's similiar obsession with the Zodiac which starts quite late in the film and can be a movie in itself. Toschi's character and the sedate pace of the law enforcement has been portrayed well by Mark Ruffalo.I get it, the real investigation took years to reach anywhere and the film tries to do justice to it. But to take the audience on a similar jounrey of frustration and closed ends as the cops is a step too far. In the end, there's no proper conclusion.

A film has been made that appeals to those of us who do not believe that sex jokes or a toilet flush are staples of great movies.Zodiac is a serious film for serious crime buffs. The film, which closely follows the original facts (as best as they are known), is almost as much a documentary as a movie. The characters are one dimensional; there is little or no humor; and, with the POSSIBLE exception of the unraveling of Robert Graysmith's marriage, there is really no subplot.All this adds up to a film that is a little long but pretty accurate and leaves you feeling like you learned something.

640,MaxStarr,"Moody, suspenseful, hair-raising ... a fascinating film",9,1 March 2007,"Edgy, suspenseful and filled with '60s and '70s period details, ""Zodiac"" is David Fincher's meticulously researched thriller focusing on the infamous serial killer who terrorized the San Francisco Bay Area for almost two decades.The human toll  both that of the victims of the terrifying killer, and on the men who desperately sought to find and unmask him  is depicted in a straightforward yet unnerving manner, keeping the viewer caught up in its web for the duration of the film. Yes, it clocks in at over 2-1/2 hours run time, but I'm not sure such a complex, lengthy and frustrating case could be told in a lesser amount of time.The principal cast members are all top-notch  Jake Gyllenhaal, Robert Downey Jr., Mark Ruffalo and Anthony Edwards bring forth their impressive talents to their characters. Downey Jr. is especially effective in a role that is perfect for him. Brian Cox (TV's ""Deadwood,"" and perhaps familiar to ""Frasier"" viewers as Daphne's father, Mr. Moon) is ideally cast as attorney Melvin Belli, and both John Carroll Lynch (""Fargo,"" TV's ""The Drew Carey Show"") and Charles Fleischer (the voice of Roger Rabbit in ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"") will raise the hairs on the back of your neck as two of the possible suspects in the mesmerizing Zodiac case. Look for ""American Graffiti's"" Candy Clark in a small but memorable role as a receptionist at the San Francisco Chronicle newspaper offices.Great period details  rotary telephones, IBM Selectric II typewriters, vintage automobiles, cigarette smoking in offices and elevators(!), a Transamerica Pyramid-less San Francisco skyline, plaid polyester pants and mile-wide jacket lapels  bring back the time period flawlessly, all underscored by a hum-along soundtrack of '60s and '70s tunes.A good, suspenseful, fascinating film. 9+ out of 10.",Zodiac

Anyway it's also based on the book by Robert Graysmith who, from the first down his work got a zodiac letter, had been destined to find look the Zodiac killer in the eyes. There are three main perspectives in the movie, Robert Graysmith, a fellow employee of his work, he worked at newspaper place ( sorry for the ""place"" thing, forgot what they're called ) who is trying to get dirt on zodiac and find out who it is too, and a cop who is obviously on the zodiac case. Let's talk about the good and bad.Good: This is a very good interpretation on what happened in that time, Jake Gyllenhaal, Mark Ruffalo, and Robert Downey Jr. were all wonderful actors, it also had a really good ""spooky"" theme to it.Bad: I really can't think of anything to complain about it 6 out of 5, YOU MUST SEE IT, buy buy buy",Zodiac

644,daveyc-54705,Fincher's best...but be patient with it,9,27 August 2021,"I'd give this movie a perfect 10 if they could maybe have shaved 20-30 minutes off it somewhere. I love the movie and think it's a masterpiece technically and from a storytelling standpoint as well. It's just hard to rewatch because it's a little long.People looking for a gory horror movie considering this is about a serial killer will be disappointed. This is mainly focused on the investigation and the obsession that can come from such a thing. Also, since Zodiac was never caught, if you're a movie goer who needs closure, you will be disappointed on that front. But it's still worth a watch for plenty other reasons.The basement scene is one of the creepiest movie scenes I've ever seen.The acting is terrific from the entire cast as well. It's a top 10 movie for me. Enjoy!",Zodiac

646,donstuie,Fincher's finest moment as a filmmaker?,9,17 May 2007,"It bugged me to learn that this film was being marketed as ""From the man who brought you Se7en"", because I knew that it would possibly hurt the film because not only is Se7en a true masterpiece of the thriller genre that may never be eclipsed in our lifetime, but this is a different universe altogether, and a different time.Forget the shocking thrills, and overall creepiness of the former. This is a film made by a director with complete control of his art, like the steady hand of a painter or sculptor. A measured look at the often forgotten victims of serial killers, the people that had to live with it daily as their lot in life. To add cheap scares or abrupt music-video style editing to such a human drama would greatly diminish the effect of this film. After this film Fincher is no longer just a master of thrills, but a master of storytelling.The beginning of the film begins in expected fashion. A young couple sitting in lover's lane, gunned down in their car; the first victims (but ones that would have huge value even 20+ years later). From here we move to the life and times of those for whom the Zodiac would become their life, and it is through these eyes that this movie is played out. We see the wide-eyed wonder and utter determination and obsession of Gyllenhall's Graysmith, the cynical and drunken musings of Paul Avery (Downey Jnr was born to play this role) and the slow disintegration of Det Dave Toschi (Mark Ruffalo's best performance IMO). While the first 1/3 of the film does contain some very graphic and frightening murder scenes, the majority of the film strays away from that to the point where Zodiac is part of the furniture for these guys, and we can see in their frazzled faces (no doubt due to Fincher's meticulous need for perfection which famously rubbed the actors the wrong way).We're with these guys every step of the way. Every dead-end, every empty alley, every frustrating act of red-tape and bureaucracy. Years pass with a simple fade-to-black, or in one case a time-lapse of the building of the TransAmerica building. While not much ""happens"" in this film, we are captivated throughout, and while we know what the final result would be it doesn't make the whole experience any less frustrating or heartbreaking. We're in it with these guys, and we feel their pain and frustration, and this is a credit to Fincher, and his need for perfection.This definitely isn't a film for the Se7en/Fight Club ""crowd"", but for anyone who enjoys great storytelling and human drama in its most real and naked form, see Zodiac.Mr Fincher, you've made a lot of believers out there.",Zodiac
647,pleasendlost,Sent Me To Sleep,4,27 January 2008,"For the first time ever in my life, I was seriously thinking of turning this off before it ended.I drifted in and out of consciousness, not because i was tired, but because of how boring this was.I cannot believe how dry, dull and drawn out this film was. It was like one of those reconstructions on ""FBI Files"" or something like that.Where was the atmosphere? How about some kind of plot woven around the two hacks? I wasn't expecting a sensationalist telling of the tale, just a bit of the filmmaker's craft to enjoy.And this was from the director of Seven...",Zodiac
648,malachy-mcgarrigle,A bit of a disappointment,3,10 April 2010,"I watched this movie knowing nothing of the background to the story and found the film to be overlong , frustrating and a serious disappointment that I was tempted to turn off even near the end. I am of the John Ford , Orson Welles school of thought as regards movies and this one just wasn't entertaining enough or engrossing at crucial moments. When it did threaten to wind up a bit of tension, it dragged it out so long that the effect was certainly lost on me. I think it did OK in rustling up the period in which it is set and that is across quite a long duration, but the films ticks functional boxes without ever scaling the heights. I am not going to argue with those on this forum who want to dissect the finer points of film making but , an average cinema goer wouldn't do that anyway . I was so disappointed in this film that I made a point of logging on here today to write this review and I don't do that for just any old dud film. Thats the only compliment I can bestow . Great City, great era, poor , poor movie .",Zodiac
649,vansuch-g,Great Movie,10,29 June 2008,"Zodiac, made by David Fichner, is a great movie. If you are expecting to watch a thriller, then you will be disappointed however. This is a character story.It starts out introducing the Zodiac murders and then shifts to a cartoonist (Gyllenhaal) and a detective (Ruffalo). Both becoming involved in solving murders the Zodiac commits, but in different ways, Ruffalo by police methods, Gyllenhaal by his own back door methods, as he is not a cop. It is a character story because it focuses on these two men and how their lives develop around the case. There are no gunfights and no chase scenes. The only violence is when the murders are committed by the Zodiac. Jake Gyllenhaal and Mark Ruffalo star in this movie. Brian Cox has a great cameo, and Robert Downey Jr and Anthony Edwards make great contributions with their supporting characters.",Zodiac
650,anirguha-60-851453,A riveting movie,7,7 October 2019,This is perhaps better than any of the run-of-the-mill thrillers. The end keeps everyone guessing.

But this hardly takes away the credit from the screenplay that has the capacity of holding the audience to the edge for 2.5 hours.,Zodiac

653,razvanyke,Very good drama with some flaws,7,23 March 2020,"Overall the movie is really nicely done and the actors are doing a great job in creating the mystery. I got to see the movie due to some reviews like ""underrated movies"" so decided to give it a try.The story of the Zodiac was new to me, I never knew how it happened back then so I got excited to see the story unfolding. What disturbed me very much are the lake scenes where the couple is stabbed, I mean they could have used a different angle to show the horror, and not make a full frame snuff like with the two getting stabbed to death.Overall I enjoyed watching the movie but those killing scenes were horrible and they totally ruined my experience.",Zodiac
654,pilotridge101,A true thriller set in the fog of San Francisco,9,6 January 2014,"David Fincher's ""Zodiac"" is based on the non-fiction book of the same title by the films main character Robert Graysmith. It spans from 1969 to 1991 following the trail of the infamous Zodiac killer who leaves notes and cyphers to the San Francisco Chronicle and other newspapers in the San Francisco and Vallejo area to gain fame. Cartoonist Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal) who works at the Chronicle starts getting into the investigation after it dies down years later he uncovers the trail including its investigators. One of them being David Toschi (Mark Ruffalo). I have liked Fincher's films in the past and I liked this one as well. I thought that the acting screenplay and cinematography were outstanding especially the role of Zodiac portrayed wonderfully by John Caroll Lynch.",Zodiac
655,rvharish,the best of the best of the best,10,15 July 2007,"Zodiac We have seen a lot of movies about cops, killers and Serial killers. And when I took the DVD of this movie I was expecting pretty much the same. But sometimes you do get something totally different from what you where expecting but in a good way, and Zodiac is an apt example of this theory.Remember Zodiac is a real story of an unsolved case in USA about a serial killer who called himself ""Zodiac"". Taking real stories are like walking on a string, it can easily become a boring endeavor if not taken a proper care off. And the talented David fincher who has directed some of the best thrillers in Hollywood like Seven, Fight club and Panic room sees to that we never get bored.There are many movies on serial killings but very few about the investigations. Zodiac is more on the process of investigations on finding the Serial killer. Never have I thought after watching ""Memoirs of a murder"" that I would see such an impressive movie on the investigation of a murder again, but Fincher has done it. Was spell bound and was totally engrossed with the investigation that after seeing the movie I wanted to crack some codes myself.The movie is about a serial killer who is obsessed with publicity, starts a series of murders with no clues or evidences, but sending a letter on the description of the murder to a popular daily. All the killings are well executed without any patterns which makes it a lot difficult for the police to come to a conclusion.A cartoonist Robert Graysmith(Jake Gyllenhaal) becomes so obsessed with the Zodiac that he decides to investigate and write a book on the Serial killer, after the police shuts the case. The movie is all about the investigations of Robert. Robert also gets assistance from the police officials who are also equally desperate to catch this maniac.The movie is done so naturally and some of the scenes do make u nail less. Like when Zodiac gives lift to a woman with a baby and when Robert goes to the house of a person who has some clue on Zodiac.The cinematography by Harris Savides was top notch and he brought in the 1960 feel with grace. The editing and Sound department elevates the movie into a new level.All the actors enacted their part with conviction especially Jake Gyllenhaal, who proves that his Gay cowboy enactment in Brokeback mountains was no flash in the pan, Mark Ruffalo as the cop was spell binding and Robert Downey JR. was a complete natural.On the whole, this is one of the best thrillers I have seen recently. David fincher proves once again his hold on the thriller genre. Outstanding Verdict  4.5/5",Zodiac
656,que1169,Where do I Know you From??,7,4 March 2015,"A credible send-up to this still officially unsolved case, to the best of my knowledge. Interestingly enough I had an acquaintance who claimed her former manager was the daughter of the Zodiac. She was of the opinion he was a former policeman in the bay area who worked peripherally on the case and who bore a striking resemblance to the sketches, and his daughter. Whether or not he threatened to kill this woman and her mother is hearsay-- Believe the name was something like Bat dorf (& this is Real history, too!), or some such but I digress. Anyway, this is rather highly recommended for those students of true crime who would like to better familiarize yourselves with this case, and I would further recommend giving a look at some older TV serials, namely Falk's Columbo, whom the detective Toschi in this film seems to be modeled on. Let's be careful out there, dog breaths - lol (to further mash-up the police drama references, which is this from?)",Zodiac
657,kallizmartin,Suspenful thriller that is spot on all over - a fantastic movie,10,18 May 2007,"I was mesmerized while watching this movie. If I were to describe Finchers' direction with one word, it'd be 'tight'. David Fincher has created a spellbinding movie, realistic and at sometimes even scary. The performances in this movie are...Actually, I am having troubles right now to come up with the right words for describing how I felt about this movie. I absolutely loved it. The universe is just so realistic that it's like traveling back in time to the 70's (in which decade most of the film takes place). The acting is plain and simple spot on. Jake Gyllenhaal is very, very good in his portrayal of the obsessed Robert Graysmith. Robert Downey Jr. is the movie's comic relief (along with a man selling coffee), but is also brilliant as the drunkard reporter Paul Avery, whom, despite using substances and drinking heavily, is a fantastic reporter. Mark Ruffalo and Anthony Edwards play the two main detectives investigating the Zodiac Killer, and they pull it off with elegance. For me, there is nothing to complain about when it comes to the acting.The soundtrack in this movie fits the time period superbly and is just plain cool. As usual the camera work is stunning, as it tends to be in Finchers' movies. This movie is very, very suspenseful at times and some viewers might find it to be a bit long. I don't feel that at all. I feel that the length of the movie is just as it should be, as the movie contains a lot of details that all deserve the time they've been given. A film like this would be nothing without it.To sum it up, this movie is spot on all over. I loved it, and you should too.",Zodiac

660,al_and_tam,You can't make this stuff up,9,5 August 2007,"This is one of the most exciting and engaging movies based on a true story that I have ever seen. You are sucked in from the very beginning and you CAN NOT tear yourself away until you find out the end. The acting is impeccable and the plot unfolds evenly and without unnecessary baggage. Movies based on true stories tend to fall into one of two traps- either they embellish until the ""truth"" is barely distinguishable or they work so hard to tell the ""true story"" that it becomes dry and boring. Real life has too many boring bits. This movie manages to stay quite true to known facts while taking just enough license to make the characters more sympathetic and to keep the tension of the story. There are a lot of jumps in time in order to skip those boring bits of real life but they are done in a way that is easy to follow.This is a must see for true-crime fans or anyone who admires superb acting and storytelling.",Zodiac
661,watbarr,Fincher Scores With Real Killer,8,2 April 2007,"Less pyrotechnics and more drama. As far as I'm concerned that is a major plus in a Fincher movie. Rigorous and long but compelling just the same. A script, finally, that is almost totally devoid of cheap shots in a story that lent itself for cheap shots. It reminded me a little of Richard Fleischer's The Boston Strangler with a major difference: most of us know the story remains inconclusive - well, I don't know if ""most"" I certainly did - but, strangely enough it doesn't detract from its fun moments of suspense and the thoroughness of the proceedings. Robert Downey Jr is superb, immediately recognizable and totally believable at the same time. Jake Gylenhaall's connection with us - the audience - is strong and powerful as well as Mark Ruffalo's cop. All in all one of Fincher's most serious, and best films.",Zodiac
662,ianschrader,Good film but fizzled out,7,30 August 2019,"The beginning of this is very captivating - murders, scrambling police, plot development - its great. It just seemed the second hour of this film was passing time stamps and dialog repetition. I know it was based off true event but maybe if Tarantino directed it we could get a vengeance killing in the end which would of been the judges fudge. Nonetheless this movie just gets so dry from its fruiting pulp and then stays that way until credits. The acting is great , The story being based off true events is just downright disturbing , but if you want a real life monster story then this is the film for you.",Zodiac
663,ewfano1,filmnut06's review,10,10 December 2007,"this is a very well done movie. great acting, directing,storyline,visuals. Jake G has impressed me with several of his performances such as Donnie Darko where he played the boy who had visions of the future. Robert Downey Jr. was really good in Wonder Boys.I'V liked several David Fincher films. Panic Room, The Game, Fight Club, and Seven.this is a true story wonderfully made.I Look forward to seeing Fichers next film The curious Case of Benjamin Button.I don't think this movie had any flaws.I think Finchers chooses wisely on the actors he wants to work with.The city lights set in the &0s of San Francisio where interesting.The music was good as well.",Zodiac
664,arsalansoomro-84161,Best Movie By David Fincher So Far.,8,29 February 2020,"This movie of Fincher is where you'll find tricks and gimmicks really low and it may makes this movie uninteresting to mass audience but it is just your poor taste which is stopping you from liking this great movie by Fincher. This indeed is one of those underrated gems we always forget to appreciate. The idea was here to showcase those hectic schedule of all workers on this still unknown killer's case in the thrilling way possible. This movie is basically Drama and Thriller mixed in one bag, let me tell you this isn't any cookie cutter idea and this is really hard to handle well enough. D. Fincher didn't perfectly nailed it, it is indeed true but still what he did is way better than what guys like Nolan do most of the time. The soundtrack, cinematography, production design and almost everything else is beautifully handled. I don't recall any flaw in those aspects. The only flaws are into the drama and some cheap thriller tricks of this movie, the cheap thriller tricks were really cartoonish and exaggerated, those were as if they wanted to just create a fabricated childish thrill for us, which was really disappointing, and unnecessary overall. It doesn't ruins the overall experience of the movie tbh. And hence, the movie all in all is pleasant gift to us all with no personal satisfaction.(IN-DEPTH)The story of this movie is about reporters and investigators' journey of finding an unknown killer from late 1960s to early 1970s. The story is pretty simple and neat, it is highly based on the true events of life. This movie's main purpose was to show you the drama between those workers who were searching for this mysterious murderer. The personal issues, the pride and pretentious acts... everything here is available for us to witness in this movie. The story is nicely handled without any doubt but sometime comes some part which are really simple but not well executed scenes. In another word, there were some really formulaic scenes which could have been improved in this movie. They can be shown with some originality but here they were shown as they are normally always done in movies. There wasn't any charm of their own in them. This kinda makes this movie sometimes a bit stale.The Direction of this movie is flawless and beautifully done. It is Fincher! Of course, this part was gonna be on rocks! The scenes are well directed, camera work is a pure gem, the idea of showcasing this drama in such shady thriller way is highly the effort of director which makes it shine. The shootouts, choreography, dialogue delivery, and everything else is nicely handled by the director here. The direction is obviously not some Nolan type with majority of childish executions and plot-holes/errors/bugs outta nowhere. It is profound in its own kind.Screenplay is really good but still yet it is the main issue of this movie. The dialogues are really ""already used ones"" stick here, and most of the scenes are highly predictable and sometimes some are goofy too. The whole famous basement scene which I had heard a lot about, was really an exaggerated thriller scene done in really childish way tbh. It was emitting from the start that it will be some common horror scene to thrill us. It was really looking cartoonish to even exist in this mature drama. The whole build up of it was really disappointing. Now, many will claim it to be showcasing Jake Gyllenhal character's fear or anything, and look I get it but the usage is a bit really over the top in this moment. The way they talk and all was really childishly handled. This scene was really not needed as well in any manner. And also, this scene yet had no originality in any manner as well. Many more scenes there were like this. The lack of anything new and original was something this movie was suffering from. It doesn't matters if you are doing something normal or simple or otherwise, the main deal is to modify it or do something to create it in such way, so you can call it your own work. It is something many directors need to learn.Actors have done justice to their characters. Without any doubt they have act well enough. Characters are really good and interesting to watch but still they aren't something which we will remember after this movie. The issue is on the writing which I have already talked about. There is a lot of typical and stale vibe in those characters in many times. It could have been improved and we all would have seen something new.The soundtrack is really nicely handled here with songs and music fitting every situation you are roamimg in this movie. The cinematopgraphy is profound too, it is the heart of this movie. If you want to enjoy a visual ride of San Francisco, this movie is among the best rides. The whole design and I mean every single one be it set design, costume design or any one, is phenomenal, and is worth your time and even dime.Now, the best and most subtle, mature and profound thing apart from Drama into Thriller genre is the universe of this movie. The whole world build in this movie is so depth and well made, you'll remember it no matter what. This is not something you'll see in Nolan movies which is a blank world with beautiful practical effects and set design and all. Nolan and many gimmicky directors or even highly thriller directors always lack this aspect. They just build up a set design and then, they are done. David Fincher just showed once again, why the building up and making it more natural and more detail is more better than just a blank universe. The universe of this movie is filled with small, small details and small characters which are portrayed accurately. The whole universe is really a big delight in this movie cuz it is well established and well maintained.All in all, this movie is the best Fincher movie tbh, this movie carries Fincher's big weapon of thriller with intense drama. This movie is providing the trademark of D. Fincher but the good news is that it is not it. It do have some issues which I have already stated but it is still great enough to have a time which you'll enjoy or not but you'll remember for sure.ZODIAC

A real event about a serial killer called Zodiac who changed three men's life totally.Although the movie is nearly three hours, but I didn't feel tired at all when I finished the movie. The movie is full of suspenseful and dark scenes to make the event more mysterious and attractive. Three main characters, their every try showed a bad result. Who is Zodiac exactly?

The acting is very good, every actor fits his or her role and they all do a very good job.The scenarios, the places where the movie played are great. ""Zodiac"" lives by the mystery, who the killer is and why he does what he does - what I find interesting is how they put the real facts in a movie. A lot of movies cannot do that well, but ""Zodiac"" showed again, how good it CAN be made.The only reason why I don't give 10/10 points is the length: 153 minutes is long and there were some things that no one would have missed.All in all a must see - great work!",Zodiac

Even so, I found the acting to very convincing and enjoyable in itself.One thing that stood out while watching this was the colour progression. The beginning is dominated by orange tones and offset with some blues. As the film goes on the balance gradually changes so that by the 80's there are mainly blues balanced out by oranges and some red.

670,goodkat2,Fincher scores again,10,22 July 2007,Zodiac focuses on the self named Zodiac serial killings of the 60s and 70s from a different angle than most psycho killer movies that is to say most of the movie is about the investigation and not the actual murders . I found this idea very refreshing and and not nearly as boring as it sounds you do get to see a couple of the murders taking place and I found those scenes very brutal and very real. During the movie a handful of suspects are thrown up and then eliminated from the police investigation for one reason or another and when the case against there main suspect is thrown out the cops are baffled . Enter Jake Gyllenhaal as a cartoonist obsessed about the identity of the Zodiac he takes up the investigation and it takes over his life ending with a suspect that both he and the police think committed the murders .Totaly different in style from Finchers Seven Gyllenhaal is superb and is involved in some great suspense scenes . All the main leads in this movie are on top form especially Robert Downey Jnr who excels in his character .Zodiac is easily the best movie i have seen this year and definitely 10/10,Zodiac

I sure didn't mean anything to me and I was truly disappointed by the Directors efforts this time.It turns out that these killings really did happen and many books have tried to tell the story, as accurate or inaccurately as possible. Unfortunately what starts off as an interesting perspective of one individual guy who wants to solve these crimes, soon becomes a fruitless battle. The film drags on for what seems hours, to then rush a span of decades into the last ten minutes; yeh the director may have got bored, because I sure did.If you're interested in the actual ongoings of this case, then watch it.

673,lauri3,Lot of surface but not enough substance,4,4 January 2009,"Zodiac is second of two movies I have seen directed by David Fincher. As ""Seven"" has been on of my favorite movies my expectations were reasonably high while regarding Zodiac.Zodiac follows series of murders, the publicity they stir, their investigations and the characters moving in the middle of their circumstances. The pace is slow and two and half hours are spent.The aesthetics seem to play main part. Cinematography is careful, the sets and production are well thought through all the way. Esthetics seem to miss the heart of the movie. When suddenly the buildup of skyscraper is shown in fast forward it never becomes apparent why this had to be shown. The soundtrack seems to try wok as some kind of periodical of 1960's and seventies but it never becomes apparent why these songs had to be played. They as the cinematography do not seem to serve the movie.Script tries to hold together wide variety of facts, happenings and long time-line. Either script fails to point essential ingredients, catalysts and shake those into surprising, relieving or revealing reactions or / and actors are not able to portrait those in their performances.In either case the movie feels like a lot of surface and not a lot of substance.",Zodiac
674,ConnRog,Very Good Indeed; Not What You Expect but Extremely Well Done,9,3 March 2007,"I found Zodiac to be a very well-crafted movie by David Fincher. Don't expect Zodiac to be your more typical thriller in the works of Seven. Since the killer was never caught they had to construct it differently and did a very good job. The movie did an extremely good job of capturing the obsession that some people had with the case. The movie is very well-acted overall. This was a very big surprise to me because I don't like Gylenhaal and I'm not that into Mark Ruffalo. The movie also has just the right amount of tension to keep you wondering which leads could pan out or be a big bust. The killer sequences were very well executed. I would say that the movie was everything I hoped it could be. I will say this though. If you think this movie is going to be detectives chasing the killer and occasionally waving their revolvers, you'll get something that has no resemblance to such a movie. Way to go Fincher!",Zodiac

Looking back at him in 'City Slicker's or s*it like 'Bubble Boy' and then seeing him in a top film like this proves he's come a long way. Mark Ruffalo is the same (nice side burns) and acts very well. But the best for me here, surprisingly, is Robert Downey, Jr. He steals the show in what has to be his best turn.Overall 'Zodiac' is not what you'd expect from the synopsis. In fact, it's even better. Don't go expecting an action-packed, all guns-blazing, twist at every turn Hollywood thriller. But do expect a highly gripping, well-acted, painstakingly detailed and compelling character study thriller. One of a kind...Sean Corrigan.",Zodiac
676,zoltan-wang,"Overall, it is a movie that worth recommending",7,15 November 2015,"Before I watched this movie, I never knew David Fincher has this movie. It might not be that famous so people rarely mention this.So before I actually watched it, I did some research. - This movie is based on a book. - Zodiac is an astronomical term describing sun and moon moving paths. - Cast. — Jake Gyllenhaal is good at playing some guy who is really obsessed in something or could be really concentrated on something, like detective in Prisoners (2013), reporter in Nightcrawler (2014). — Robert Downey Jr, well we all know, he is good at play iron man, and iron man-ish characters, meaning that his style is some talented guy, enjoying luxurious life and at the same time doesn't care about details. — And Mark Raffulo, the professor in The Avengers (2012) and Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015), detective in Now You See Me (2013), and some character in The Normal Heart (2014 TV movie). In my memory, his character was always pursuing something and exhausted and always not the one who won the most. I would say, his performance is really wonderful, especially in how to bring audience into the way he is thinking. - James Vandebilt is the writer for this movie, taking care of screenplay. It's the first time I pay attention to writers. So really no comments..So as the movie begins, I was thinking, Fincher is really good at attracting people's attention, and he's really good at Thriller genre movies. There's a scene at the beginning, two young kids are shot and that suddenly gets my into thinking. What is happening? Why was that? What is it about? Questions like these would strike my mind make me focus on this murder case. But as time goes by, I feel like the movie was too long and my attention slipped away. Since I cannot really focus on the mysteries Fincher was trying to make. And thus at the end I felt it was not that good.Then I did the research again, and found out that this is the real murder case happened in history. And someone said this is so good cause it makes everything so real and while we are watching it we will always keep thinking about the real case. Well I can only say it depends on background. Since I'm quite not familiar with that, I didn't really pay attention to this.So in summary, I wanna list all elements in Thriller Movies. - Stories. Really good stories! It is always combined with Crime and Mystery. And of course Drama. Since movie is about telling a story (not only about the story itself), it is also important to keep an eye on rhythm. — Usually there's like puzzles or some patterns that make people obsessed. Since it has this really requirement. The writer or the director should somehow make it more dramatic. In fictional ones, it's okay that they create wonderful but unreal plots. But in factual ones, they need to pay more attention to how they handler facts and drama. — And good characters, maybe detective, maybe the bad guy, how has this really special personality that is so attractive. Or even psycho! — Well I'm kind of confused about the difference between Thriller and Mystery.Overall, it is a movie that worth recommending.",Zodiac
677,argylefarm,I didn't like it...,3,29 July 2007,"Sorry folks, I couldn't hang with this one. I like all the actors. I know they do great jobs. But the writing and directing kinda sucked. I never finished watching the DVD. It doesn't help when you already know how the story ends. Who did it? Who cares? They never caught the person. A lot of assumptions made here. I could not get into the first half of the movie. The killings seemed so made up. If they we're based on actual fact, I didn't believe it. The directing is what really lost me. First the movie starts out slow, the actors acted slowly and talked slowly. Could they have drug this out any longer? Then all of a sudden we get flashes of events that pretty much pertain to details in the letters and communications, stuff you want to see. I kept wondering when ""Grissom"" was going to walk in. Oh that's right this happened in the 70's. Before PC's and cell phones. Maybe that's why the cops seem so retarded. No technology. No education. Equals no suspect. And what about the animal crackers? Did the character have low blood sugar, or did the dog need a reward to get him in the car to do his job? My dog will roll over with out treats. I blame the writing and directing on my lost interest.",Zodiac
678,SJpixtster,Fincher's Inept Thriller,2,10 August 2013,"I thought Seven was an excellent thriller but Zodiac is boring. I streamed it last night. For the rest of you, don't bother. It amazes me that Fincher managed to take a well written script and strong performances and create a boring film that I turned off half way through it. This film lacked any intensity whatsoever. The plot is excellent and intriguing based on the real story. The actor's bring on the performances but Fincher's direction was the problem. You would have thought this was his first big budget feature. His shot selection was so distant that I didn't feel a thing. The eye-lines were off half the time. I found myself answering emails instead of watching this. Fincher knows how to create some beautiful well choreographed crane shots, and other well framed long shots but put them altogether and you get a poorly boring paced film.",Zodiac
679,sg_o14,...To be remembered...,9,21 August 2007,"Many people knew what the Zodiac killer was all about but none of us know who he is/was and never will.Without a doubt, a majority of people who have watched this film will think that this is the best Hollywood has offered this year...'YET'...The reason as to why I'm saying that this movie will be remembered is because David Fincher managed to keep the sense of mystery alive throughout the movie. The same way he did it in THE GAME and PANIC ROOM. Very few directors manage to end up doing exactly that.This film is by far Mark Ruffalo's finest work I have seen. Movies like 13 going on 30 and Just Like Heaven weren't even close. Gyllenhall has done a good job as usual. It was totally expected from him. However, Robert Downey Jr. was the ultimate package. He has always been underrated and I hope that this movie proves him other wise. He certainly stole every scene he was in this movie.This movie is not about the killings. It is about the pursuit of the killer. The killings were no doubt appalling in real life but the manner in which the killer(s) were never caught is as intriguing.The greatest accomplishment of this movie was that it did not leave any loopholes and there were not much questions asked at the end of the movie. Everybody now knows what had happened. Nonetheless, this movie is will certainly inspire you to read Graysmith's book, if you have not already. This movie will certainly inspire you to follow up on the entire zodiac killer legend.",Zodiac
680,mommies42,Finch Perfect,8,3 March 2007,"One thing about this film is that it is not your typical serial killer thriller. Nothing like Se7en, so don't go with that expectation. This is a film with facts, a film that educates as well as entertains. One thing this movie did was keep me and most of the people in the theater glued to the screen. Fincher's style is mesmerizing, something that grabs your attention above all else. Another thing he is able to accomplish is atmosphere, the first scene of the movie is the second official Zodiac killing. Fincher creates an atmosphere worthy of an 80s slasher film. The creepy Mustang is menacing enough that we don't need to see the killer, the car and its tinted windows tell us that these kids are doomed. It starts with a bang and then we're dragged into this mystery of facts and obsession. The Graysmith character is by far the most interesting and Downey delivers a brilliant supporting role. Ruffalo's plays his detective role a la Bullitt. The characters work and go hand in hand with the dialogue. All in all I believe that this movie is one of Fincher's best and is not for the dimwitted, do not expect your normal serial killer film. This may have some graphic killings and an especially disturbing scene in which a woman is stabbed several times while tied up. But this is a movie based on facts and delivers them like a book would. I rate it a 8/10.",Zodiac
681,jamesclarence,One of the most underrated films of all time,10,17 July 2018,"Zodiac is by far one of my most favorite film of all time and I always consider that this is by far the best film of David Fincher. I also think that this is one of the best non-fiction film. There is a lot of things to praise on this film but first the summary of the film. 
SUMMARY: This film is all about the real case of the Zodiac killer who killed in the San Francisco Bay Area at some time around the late 1960's and early 1970's and the investigation and the manhunt that came along with it. It also follows the journey of Robert Graysmith (played by Jake Gyllenhaal), a cartoonist at the San Francisco Chronicle who got interested in the case and tried to investigate it. This film is based-off of the 1986 book ""Zodiac"" that was written by Robert Graysmith.
Everything about this film works. The cinematography, performances, pacing, direction, just everything. In fact, I think this is far better than the another film of Fincher that is also one of my favorite which is Seven (1995). Fincher grew more subtle in the years and you can tell that when you watch Zodiac. It's not some they will just shootout all of a sudden, cheesy car chase scenes, etc.. The film is actually almost true to it's original source. It's a real investigation film about a serial killer. In fact, it's not so much about the Zodiac killer but is about the obsession of the leading actors to search for the Zodiac killer. Speaking of leading actors, best performances by Mark Ruffalo, Robert Downer, Jr. and especially by Jake Gyllenhaal. They were great at this film as you can tell. The direction is also great, David Fincher is one of my most favorite directors of all time. But the best thing about this film is its pacing and its cinematography. This might not work for some other people, some might complain the pacing is too slow or very methodical. It's because the film takes its time and it doesn't just rush it all. Personally, I found the pacing of this film great, it makes me feel also obsessed of finding out the identity of the Zodiac killer. The cinematography is mesmerizing, it almost feels hypnotic. The cinematography of Harris Savides is a great thing. Another thing to praise is the use of visual effects and CGI (computer-generated imagery). Fincher wanted to be this film to be as accurate as much as possible even the setting of this film. The visual effects of this film feels seamless, I didn't even doubt that there was CGI involved and when I found out that they actually used CGI, I was shocked. The music of this film is also great, it's very subtle. It's overall a great film and is definitely a must-watch film. I think this is the one of the best masterpiece of all time.",Zodiac
682,MSchnitzler2000,it is only wearying for the characters,8,4 June 2007,"Before I went to see the movie tonight, I had read some comments here and in the German press which show a highly controversial discussion about Fincher's new work. Now I know why the opinions are so divergent. You must know what it's all about if you want to understand and enjoy the movie.This is NOT a movie about a serial killer! The topic is the investigation which is carried out both by the police and the journalists. The only action scenes are the murders which are short and ruthless. During the rest of the movie, many people are talking.Although it lasts for about two and a half hours, it's not boring. The length of the movie represents the wearying investigation. The weeks, months and years go by and there is no real success. You can actually feel the despair of all the detectives and journalists - and then there is the unresting and pertinacious main character Robert Graysmith, who wants to solve the mystery by hook or by crook. He is the only person who is constantly interested in the case while a cop quits the service and star reporter Paul Avery becomes an alcohol addict.Although there are some anachronism goofs, it is interesting to see how e.g. the cars and the coke vending machines become modern during the movie.Nevertheless I can only give 8 out of 10 points because there was hardly anything about the cryptic signs in the movie. Robert only shows a book about code-breaking, but - in contrast to ""Da Vinci Code"" - it is almost irrelevant. There should have been a better balance of code-breaking and the analysis of handwriting.This is the third Fincher-movie I saw and it is totally different from ""Se7en"" and ""Panic Room"". Except for minor shortcomings, the director proves that even in 2007 you can convince the audience without explosions, chases, bloodshed and sex.",Zodiac

684,bilgedeger,A Realistically Real Story,8,19 April 2020,I'll be the one to admit Zodiac is not the most fast paced or action packed movie -in fact there is rarely either of those things in it- but its sometimes very slow and repetitive nature does rewards us with the exact feeling that the people investigating the Zodiac killer experienced back in the days when they went YEARS with radio silence not knowing if they ever came close to finding him or not. Does it have a extremely satisfying and epic ending? No. But that's the beauty of this movie. It doesn't betray reality for the means of making a blockbuster. A definite must watch. You just need to keep a open mind while watching it.,Zodiac
685,sapascualgarrigos,Great Movie,9,2 May 2020,"Many people are complaining that this movie didn't know how to end. While I understand their frustrations, please don't listen to those feeble minded children. This movie tells the real story of the people tried to catch the zodiac killer. People fixate on this movie like it is a thriller, and while it does have very well made and tense scenes. It is more a character study than anything else. The characters go through decades with these mysteries and their actions and motivations are understandable and relatable. The movie wasn't particularly funny, but it had a couple of funny scenes. The performances are amazing and while the story takes place in the 70s, the movie never shoves that into your face. Some of the hairstyles and costumes feel very seventies, but it never distracts from the stories. The editing, cinematography and shot composition is good, but not exceptional. My only real complaint is that it has a really slow pacing, however, it doesn't feel unnecessary since we are watching them go through decades. It doesn't feel unjustified. If you have a couple of hours to kill, go watch it. It isn't for everyone, but I though it was great. 9/10",Zodiac

If you go into Zodiac expecting a traditional police procedural or crime film you will be disappointed. But if you go into Zodiac and accept the film on its own terms then you will be rewarded.This is a haunting examination of obsession that tears at the moral fabric of the main characters. The Zodiac case both nourishes and destroys the characters.There are brilliant scenes n this film and each could be a masterclass in how to create tension. The scenes with the Zodiac killer are done in such a matter of fact way that they become truly unnerving.The film may be overlong and at times tangential but its also bod and brilliant and as such well worth your time.",Zodiac
688,elspethkrichardson,Started well.. Deteriorated thereafter,6,20 May 2007,"I've got to say, when I came to look at the reviews after having watched 'Zodiac' tonight, I was very surprised to see so many positive reviews. Having watched it with a few friends tonight, I was very disappointed. The film started off very promising, with some rather brutal scenes filmed intimately for maximum impact - had me squirming in my seat and I was set for an hour or so's worth of engaging cinema. But the film deteriorated steadily from that point onwards, having me fidgeting in my seat until I was too lethargic to move. The pace appeared to disappear from about 1 hour in and never returned from that point onwards. I appreciate this is a movie recording over 20 years worth of actual events, but at some point the director must use some 'artistic license' to introduce some entertainment...Robert Downey Jnr. was fantastic portraying a drunkard spiralling towards his own self-destruction...perfect casting from that point of view...All in all, a little to serious and slow-moving for my liking... but hey, each to their own",Zodiac
689,deviljoker,two thumbs up,9,24 July 2007,"A lot of films based on actual events can loose their rhythm. Zodiac is an exception. The late sixties early seventies periods of the film are captured perfectly. It is easy for film makers to overdo it and become close to fancy dress especially when dealing with the seventies. Comedies like ""Starsky and Hutch"" do this deliberately to good effect, but I shudder when it happens in more serious work. Zodiac grabs hold of you from the opening scene. It is well paced and takes you into the world of the main characters. There isn't a way to have made this movie better. There is a feeling of frustration and failure among the characters toward the middle of the movie and for the audience this is palpable. What happens after this dampening of action and mood, is an acceleration of emotion that had me gripping the arms of my chair, truly on the edge, willing Graysmith on to whatever outcome the film has for us. I was pleading for closure, such was Gylenhaals performance. Garofalo,Edwards and Downey Jr. all had stand out performances. Edwards underplayed his role to perfection and Downey Jrs casting was a masterstroke as a downward spiraling talent. His role brought rich texture and contrast to the cast. The acting/direction was seamless. A very well rounded smooth, real production. This movie is a real gem.",Zodiac
690,jassssssssper,Closure Please?,1,17 August 2008,"This CONTAINS SPOILERSI sat there for 2 hours waiting for the capture of the Zodiac, well I guess they thought that sticking to the true story of the Zodiac, being that he was actually never caught, was better than making a good film. So what to do?, What to do?, how to end a true story with no real ending? I say improvisation would have been fun, but they decided to go with the old text ending. How much fun that was, I sat there for five mins reading text that was attempting to conclude this poor excuse for a murder mystery and at then end of this essay on screen he ends up dies a natural death UN-CAPTURED. I walked in expecting a great murder mystery but ended up walking out cold and violated. This just may be the most boring film ever recreated( and who created the first one, must have been an idiot), DO NOT WATCH THIS IF YOUR YOUNG (13-25) but if your are old and boring then by all means see this film.",Zodiac
691,jskidmore271,A well told story with an eerie afterthought...,9,6 October 2008,"The film itself is one interesting ride retelling the unsolved Zodiac murders that occurred in San Francisco in the late '60s and early '70s. What makes this film so compelling is that its based on a true story and the story is well crafted which gives it an even more spooky atmosphere. David Fincher does a great job directing and the actors do an awesome job at developing their characters especially Jake Gyllenhal as the real life Robert Greysmith. As the film unravels you start to root for his characters as he goes to great lengths in trying to solve the Zodiac murders. While the film throws out several clues and factors as to who the culprit probably is, and some of the suspects you start to believe might really be the culprit, it stills leaves you wondering 'is the Zodiac still out there or is the Zodiac dead?' You decide...I've seen the film 3 times and every time it leaves me more & more intrigued. I actually did some research on the subject and found that the motion picture is very faithful to the real-life account. I think the only think that would turn people off from this film is the length (158 min) but if you get into it you won't really notice, and the realism.

Amazing in its perfectly pitched tone, style and atmosphere, truthful to the tiniest detail, daring in its thought-provoking psychology and refusal to give simple answers....Zodiac is a truly bold, truly intense and truly intelligent movie....a piece of art...that's also enormously entertaining and will scare you more and more..the longer you think about it.",Zodiac

696,silent_town,Fincher matured: Zodiac,9,5 March 2007,"One of the more interesting things about Zodiac is that it's laid back. This is a story that spans 20 years, with numerous reporters and investigators involved as well as a slew of suspects. You'd expect it to be complicated, probably overly so. Yet director Fincher let's the story flow simply. The perspective is the reporters, the detectives, and the victims. Fincher tells the movie like Graysmith wrote the book: a presentation of facts and observations. This lets the audience interact with the movie. As Robert Graysmith (Gylenhaal) is piecing the case together, so are we until the next revelation of factual evidence (which you will see was bare, but the amount of circumstantial evidence against a certain suspect was a mountain high). As most people know, the Zodiac was never caught. A big question in peoples' minds before seeing this movie is, ""is there a resolve?"" The movie provides enough brain food for you to come to your own conclusions and that's what makes it such a good watch.",Zodiac
697,Hmshollyt,"Zodiac is a terrific, suspense-filled film.",8,18 February 2007,"The characters are compelling, be they reporter, cop or possible killer. Jake Gyllendall gives the best performance. His character takes over the last third of the film, as he gets close to the likely killer(s). A cat and mouse scene with Jake's character at one of their homes had me twisting my napkin into shreds. The outdoor shots of San Francisco make artistic use of vibrant dark colors at night, and glowing pastels during the day. The interiors capture the maze-like process the detectives and reporters must navigate. The murder scenes reminded me of Bonnie and Clyde. Oddly, all three female victims look and act alike, with the wide-eyed innocence of a 70's airline stewardess. The other female characters are well-drawn. The possible killer's are fascinating. Mark Ruffalo and Robert Downey, Jr. are also excellent.",Zodiac
698,bivey0951,"A really dull film...but if you need to kill 3 hours, then this film is for you.",4,5 March 2007,"""Zodiac"" starts out with the potential to be an exciting movie. After the first 15 minutes, you are left with nothing but the minutia of a curious newspaper cartoonist with the hobby of figuring out who may be the serial killer. Unfortunately, the film WALLLOWS in this minutia because it drags on for another 2 1/2 hours after anything that resembles excitement/suspense happens. Mark Ruffalo and Jake Gyllenhaal are respectable in their extremely tedious and boring roles but Robert Downey Jr. makes both of them seem amateurish by comparison. If the film were edited down by an hour and a half, it would be worth renting. Otherwise, it seems like a dull ""America's Most Wanted"" re-enactment.",Zodiac
699,jills_nipple,Cinema doing what it does best,10,18 March 2007,"Cinema is at its strongest when it transports you to another time and place. Watching Zodiac, I felt like I was in San Francisco in the 1960s/70s/80s/90s. I felt the excitement of a city gripped in terror at a faceless yet enigmatic killer and I felt like I was in the clutches of the obsession that devoured 4 men.A lot of criticism of this film has been leveled at the fact that it is a 2 1/2 hour film without resolution. For a start, I could have sat through 6 hours of police work on this case and not be bored. And relating to that, that the case is never solved (which, admittedly, I was worried about when I first heard about it), is the most perfect and ONLY way this film could and should be ended. It is not like Deadwood Season 3 ***POSSIBLE 'DEADWOOD' SPOILERS*** where I screamed at the TV for not betraying history and having Swearingen BEAT THE LIVING HELL FROM HEARST, if history was changed in this case it would have weakened the movie, as at its heart it is a tale of obsession and having the case unresolved serves only to underline this theme.Another concern some people seem to have with this film is that Zodiac is, as a serial killer, an ""underachiever"", having only 5 confirmed kills. The film only shows 3 of these murders and while for some, murders may equate to quality (Zodiac being therefore 3/7 of the film that Se7en is) the point is that Zodiac, as a villain who effectively uses the media to publicize himself, is a different kind of serial killer, a master of self-promotion and a bigger scalp for those who hunt him. The lack of murders in no way hurts the film - if anything it makes the killer a more thrilling quarry.The film is perfectly-paced and immaculately production-designed and for anyone wanting an absorbing chase (in the plodding, police-work sense) and a world you never have need to doubt is exactly the time and place it professes to be, Zodiac is the film for you.",Zodiac

In the first 90 minutes you will see the murders of the zodiac and the actions of the police and Chronicle newspaper to solve the mystery so you won't get bored. Then you start to expect something to happen, something to twist the plot, something that makes you say: "" Oh my god, look at what happened!"", "" I didn't expect him to be the zodiac killer!"" Unfortunately nothing dramatic happens and the last hour passes by very slowly. The ending, in my opinion, was even more tedious. The cast was good- Jake Gyllenhaal, Robert Downey and Mark Ruffalo were suitable for their roles. Conclusion? Just a mediocre mystery. I'm pretty charitable to give this 6/10.",Zodiac

703,tian_tonio,Waste of time historical thriller with no thrill,1,1 March 2007,"I saw a screening of this film and couldn't have been more disappointed. If you need a spoiler warning to know that the Zodiac was NEVER caught and this movie gives NO New info, then I would like to welcome you to Planet Earth. I am not a Fincher basher. He moved from Music Videos to movies and struck GOLD with Se7en, one of my favs, and Fight Club. Nowhere to go but down for him and it has been a gradual free fall that seems to have hit bottom. Not to say the film didn't look nice. No complaints to Finchers direction. His decision to try to show in nearly 3 hours what could have been a nice 1 or 2 hour A&E special was his mistake. I have no problem with this movie sticking as much as it could to straight facts but don't come at us with a Hollywood release if you are not going to show us some Hollywood. The thought really passed through my head whether or not it would be disrespectful to just leave about 2 hours into it. The problems with a Zodiac movie are plentiful:1. It remains unsolved so there is no viewpoint of the killer. Any attempt at this would defeat the by-the-facts approach.2. All the facts of the murders are pretty well known. No surprises in-store for the audience.3. The prime suspect, Leigh Allen, is now dead as well and never admitted to being Zodiac. In fact, I even think he was the Zodiac but no forensic proof was ever connected to him. The end credits do mention that he did not match a DNA from the letters that had been licked to seal them. 4. Contact from the Zodiac was so far apart chronologically that this film had to fade to black and then jump forward in time so often that I felt I was reading a subtitled film there were so many times and places at the bottom of the screen.5. The movie doesn't even know when to end. It just keeps going and going and going. Fincher should have tried for 3 and a half hours and included Allen's death and the time he was confronted by cameras at his house. I have seen the footage of that and it was creepier than anything in this movie. 6. The zodiac caused disruption and chaos to many lives all over but we only get to see a drugged/drunk reporter, a cartoonist that gets and loses his whole family life, and two cops. One who transfers and the other that is addicted to animal crackers. Fincher doest make us care or really feel for these characters. Why was this movie advertised like it was going to move like some thriller? Shameful use of the basement scene to inject some drama and tension. It was far too late into the movie to think that there was some revelation coming. The facts are the facts, no matter how boring they look on the big screen. In FROM HELL, The Hughes Brothers/Johnny Depp look at Jack the Ripper, they used true events and people while presenting some of that case's theories. ZODIAC beats the theory presented to death for well over two hours and doesn't get the audience any closer to the identity of the killer.

704,fabph4ntom,A killer of a thriller,9,31 December 2007,"Dec 31st 2007.It has been 7 months since I first saw the latest from director, David Fincher. I have chosen to leave my comments, until now, to make because as far back as May, (the films UK debut)I had a hunch that I had just bore witness to the film of the year, but I needed to be sure, so now over 7 months and countless pictures, on the final day of what we will no doubt fondly look back on as the year 2007 and having rounded off my cinema going year with ""I am legend"" I can now proclaim that I was indeed right after all. I have seen many fine films over the past year but none that capture the pensive intelligence, the raw intensity and the artfully crafted, not to mention painstakingly realised, elegance of Zodiac. Armed with a sophisticated script by James Vanderbilt and a trinity of quality performances from his leading men, Fincher showboats his ,Kubrick of the 21st century flair, for all to see, appreciate and - unlike most of this centuries output so far - feel. A masterpiece from its nerve shredding opening salvo to its skillful conclusion, where Fincher manages to have his cake and eat it by providing both a factually correct open ending, as well as offering up author Robert Gray smith's chillingly satisfying conjecture. See it today or regret it forever. FILM OF THE YEAR 2007.

705,oliverwilliamknight,"What a cast. What a story, What a film.",7,7 December 2015,"When a movie casts Jake Gylenhaal alongside Robert Downey Jr and Mark Ruffalo you expect something great, and this movie delivered. What I loved about this thrilling tale of the Zodiac killer was the narrative point of view. It was astoundingly interesting to learn the tale of the Zodaic killer from the viewpoint of the media and the police, as opposed to the film following the killer. David Fincher does an incredible job directing this movie and the most prominent element of his contribution to the film, for me, was the mise en scene. Everything from the lighting to the props and costumes makes everything so believable and really compelled me to think this movie was filmed in the late 60's. Fincher will always be an incredible director and I'd largely consider this movie to be one of his finest. If you're looking for an action packed thriller, this movie isn't for you. But if you're looking for a compelling and enticing thriller, then this is hands down worth watching.",Zodiac

709,andrefabriciorodrigues,What a Masterpiece!,10,10 May 2020,"Zodiac is a 2007 movie directed by David Fincher starring Jake Gyllenhall, Robert Downey Jr and Mark Ruffalo. This movie is a drama/thriller. The true story of the investigation of the ""Zodiac Killer"", a serial killer who terrified the San Francisco Bay Area, taunting police with his ciphers and letters. The case becomes an obsession for three men as their lives and careers are built and destroyed by the endless trail of clues. What an incredible movie. The cast is fantastic. Jake Gyllenhall, Robert Downey Jr and Mark Ruffalo did an amazing job, especially Jake Gyllenhall. The direction by David Fincher is stunning. The cinematography and camara work were very very good. The story is fascinating. The dialouge is great. The film is very well paced. It never feels boring. It´s very entertaining and enjoyable. The fact that the Zodiac killer was never caught is terrifying. The obession created by Robert Greysmith is somehow interesting and distrubing at the same time. Zodiac is not just an out-standing movie, but a fascinating piece of story telling. This movie also succeeds being tense and wow. What a very tense movie. Every scene with the Zodiac Killer is so very tense. David Fincher proves again why he is one of the best directors currently working. Every aspect of this movie is extraordinary. It´s ridiculous to think that Zodiac wasn´t nominated for not even one Oscar. The Oscars don´t determine what which movie is good or bad. One of the most fantastic movies I ever seen. If you ask me what a perfect movie is, I would say Zodiac. What a movie. What a masterpiece.100/100.",Zodiac

I was bored in the middle of the screening. It reminds me Michael Mann's ""The Insider"" with Russel Crowe - very good ""reportage"" thing, but it lacks the suspense in the thriller style. It's nobody's fault, because - in both cases - the screenplay was written by life itself :). And life was writing it quite long time. So, there are mostly only FACTS in the story. With little amount of fiction. And those facts simply lies in history in not very special order - the story of Zodiac simply doesn't have the thriller-like dramaturgy line with rising amount of suspense and terrifying final scene. That is why the film does not thrill as much as ""Seven"", or Silence of the Lambs"". It rather intrigues. Like ""The Insider"". That's why I was little disappointed. One or two scenes were quite thrilling but that's it.Another bothering thing, when dealing with FACTS, is that You know from the beginning how the film is gonna end :(.PROS:* Great acting - Mark Ruffalo especially, but Robert Downey Jr. is good too (as always) * interesting as a ""reconstruction"" * interesting character transformation of Graysmith (well played by Jake Gyllenhaal - again good acting)CONS: * Rather boring in the middle* lots of unnecessary details (dates and places especially) - I still remember the name Sherwood, but I don't know who it was in the film :)* not a thriller :)",Zodiac

I have followed this case with some interest for years and the attention to detail and accuracy was magnificent. Standout performances by Jake Gyllenhaal, Anthony Edwards (although I have trouble separating him from Dr. Green) and Robert Downey Jr. should be noted, as well as by Mark Ruffalo (an actor with whom I was not familiar). I appreciated the fact that not once does the movie descend into melodrama. Some of the early scenes are graphic and grisly, however, anything less would be to soft-pedal the horror. Although the major events occurred in the 1968-1972 time frame, work continues on this case, to this day. Recently, a partial DNA profile was obtained from one of the envelopes the killer sent. Running 2 hours and 40 minutes, the ""updates"" are relegated to text in the trailer. Interesting, almost everyone in the theater stayed to read every word.",Zodiac

If you want to know the story of the Zodiac killer, read an article online; or better yet, read a book. I assure you, you can finish a comprehensive book in nearly the same amount of time it takes to watch this debacle of a film.The acting is superb. Downey, Jr. and Gillenhall do a fantastic job of recreating the emotion that the investigators must have felt in pursuit of this brainy killer. This, however, is where the compliment ends. At 2 hours and 40 minutes, the average movie-goes, like myself, expects ample action and fantastic twists. Movies can be this long and effective. Unfortunately, Zodiac has far too few interesting turning points and suspenseful moments. At one point, my two friends who were joining me, who are the average movie enthusiasts, were sound asleep. People left the theater early, I even heard several sighs as the plot NEVER got any more interesting.I will admit, the end is acceptable. They finally tie all the loose ends together.

After over two and a half hours of the movie I walked out of the theater stunned stunned at how hugely disappointing it was.I never thought I'd say this about a Fincher movie but Zodiac is just plain boring. The movie is way, way too long. You just don't care about the characters or about what's going on after a while. Forget about any kind of cool cinematography like you've seen in Se7en, Fightclub or even Panic Room. Zodiac looks like the exact opposite of anything that the director has done before. It seems to be purposely bland. Zodiac seems to purposely want to grind away at you with detail after detail, underplaying events with ultra low key acting & photography. The experience for me was that I had been ground down to not caring anymore about wanting to stay in the theater. I couldn't wait for the movie to end or for it to peter out with a whimper as it eventually does.",Zodiac

He brings to light the many hidden facts about Zodiac that had never been unearthed thus grabbing the viewer's interest. It is a complete thriller and makes you wonder who the real Zodiac is. The climax is actually the thing that you should be waiting for.

726,shec9411,Not your average masterpiece,9,12 October 2007,"So why don't many people like this movie? Why will people you talk to say how boring this movie was? Simple, the art of the two and a half hour movie has been lost to either the too long (POTC 3, LOTR) or the too short, making you want more from the movie (for my money, Munich and several others). So we have been breast fed on hour and a half movies that anything over 100 minutes bores most people unless there is a large amount of violence or explosions. But, this movie is one of the best movies of the year despite any critics of it you know.This is a film that brings Hollywood back to Hitchcock. The script is more like a play, the dialog well written and the characters deep. The leading performances are strong, the strongest and most surprising being Mark Ruffalo. This is not the average fincher film, not fight club, not seven. Instead of packing everything with style and philosophy, fincher lets the story and the characters move the movie along. And, it stays in realism, rarely straying from the source material, making it ambiguous, not pointing fingers at any single suspect. Once you have it figured out, the main suspect changes. The film treats you like the Zodiac treated the investigators, teasing you, making you think that you knows who was the killer. It is a film that makes you think, and no one is used to that. And what makes this film suspenseful, tense, even creepy, isn't something within the film, it is the truth.",Zodiac

Their ability to recreate the feeling of mystery and suspense that no doubt came from these killings is unbelievable. Every time I watch this movie I always feel like taking the details and trying to come to alternate conclusions. It's a great movie for people who like mysteries and puzzles and who think they would enjoy being a detective.Either way, awesome movie. I recommend it.",Zodiac

Many of my colleagues who saw this film complained that it was far too long and in the end, lacked a satisfying resolution. Of course it is hard to resolve a case in film that has yet to be resolved in real life. What I think many viewers have overlooked in this film is the attention paid to editing and cinematography.It is refreshing that in a time of constant film rehashes and cliché endings some directors dare to offer unique and fresh approaches to story telling. Although Zodiac is not one of the best films of 2007, it certainly gives audiences something to think about, and future directors something to learn from.",Zodiac
729,ajreinwand,The New Genius in Crime Thrillers,9,11 March 2008,"Some people may complain that Zodiac is a little too long, but it really has to be as long as it is. Every detail about the ""Zodiac"" is covered and told with great acting and story telling, and while we know don't know what's happening, we get 3 different story arcs for our patience. I've never seen a movie start off following one main character - and then halfway through continuing with the other main character. It was sheer genius! And it didn't have a bad flow to it, I actually didn't even realize until watching it numerous follow up times. It's extremely gripping, compelling and haunting all without splattering you with over exaggerated (and overused) gruesome blood scenes like other films do, which really made me love it all that much more. If you liked Seven, you'll probably enjoy Zodiac. Major differences are that Zodiac isn't dark and rainy, but where Seven was smart in its delivery, Zodiac exceeds it.

731,joanna-preston,Slow-paced and unsatisfactory,6,16 September 2009,"No blatant spoilers here, but better safe than sorry.When I first heard of this movie, I thought that it would be something similar to Seven, only we'd have people killed for the signs of the Zodiac. Like an Aquarius drowned, Scorpio stung by a scorpion etc. Sorry to disappoint, that's not the case and if that's what you're looking for, steer clear.The movie is extremely slow-paced. It may be based on true events, but that does not mean we need or want to see every single bit of police investigation, follow every false lead. The huge gaps between resurgences of Zodiac slowed it down even more. OK, you're restricted by the material, but it doesn't mean you can't speed things up a bit. I do prefer more thoughtful movies than action fests, but this had zero tension. The main characters never really felt like they were in danger.Which brings me to another point. Who on earth is the protagonist? They really can't seem to decide, and it makes it hard to get into the movie. Picking one character and telling it from their viewpoint would have made it so much more immersive. As it was, I felt more like I was watching a documentary than a movie.And I think that's where the problem lies. They tried too hard to stick to the actual story instead of altering it a bit for the sake of entertainment. Certainly the case is an interesting one, but I don't want to know the facts, I want to know the experience.If you're looking a fast paced thriller, this is not it. It's not outright terrible, just mediocre. I regret watching it, seemed like such a waste of my evening.",Zodiac

I was thinking that it would have a fantastic ending or something, ""how could this have 7.8 on IMDb? There should be something.""Well, the whole movie seems to move in circles, leading to nowhere every time, and the worst part is... they lead to nowhere even in the end!There are some scenes there that made me wonder what the hell were they doing in here!

733,Animal_Hospital,New Hollywood strikes again,7,22 June 2007,"Perhaps the reason why I liked Zodiac so much is because it's like a content, legitimate child of Pakula and Stone: All the President's Men without paranoia and JFK minus the conspiracy. Very much a 'talkie', but also a careful, almost elegiac study of America that lost its innocence, bypassed by summer of love and jaded by Watergate. Where Pakula would have build up uneasiness and Stone spirals of suspicion, Fincher lets time and inefficiency do the work and every suspense gets counteracted by series of anticlimaxes. Fincher never lets us focus for too long on either one character or a suspect, throwing sly hints here and there that lead nowhere, and we are back with our good, obsessive guys, suspending the paranoia once again. Impeccably directed, shot and edited, this film is a rare delight of attentive storytelling (only once, about three quarters in, somewhat forgetting Glynnehall's character, which could probably be attributed to compromised editing).Another thing that is worth mentioning is how rarely one encounters a period drama that doesn't overwhelm with period details. Apart from astonishingly faithfully recreated photography, in its warm brown and yellowish hues, soundtrack is as an unobtrusive and historically discreet, all fuzzy, sticky funk and r'n'b, eerie pop loop of Lynn Anderson and Donovan's Hurdy Gurdy Man in particular lending a sinister and ironic touch. A special mention goes, among all really great cast, to Anthony Edwards for continuing where Kevin Costner got distracted by megalomania and Robert Downing Jr for not over-camping it.",Zodiac

I found out Fincher was going digital and using Apple's Final Cut Pro, and that even intrigued me even more (being that I make shorts in digital). I've been a fan since I saw Seven and Fight Club. Let's say, just ignore the haters out there that this movie is dull and slow. I have to say on acting, cinematography, and the music/score, this movie kept me hooked. Fincher did a great job directing his actors/actresses to real and haunting and relateable. Jake was fantastic expressing Graysmith's mania with an eerie feel. Ruffalo and Downey were superb in their roles. The digital film looked amazing (much better than Lucas's attempt with Star Wars). His signature yellowish tint was there ;) And I thought the music made the movie flow and feel like 2 hours instead of its actual runtime of about 2 hours 40 minutes. I recommend this to all who enjoy movies and don't care about a nice clean cut ending (Fight Club wasn't!). This movie is more about the hunters of the Zodiac than the zodiac killer himself.",Zodiac

Most of this film is centered on the obsessions of a cop and a cartoonist trying to identify Zodiac over a period of 2 decades. It really is a shame this came out after the Oscars, because Jake Gyllenhal as well as Mark Ruffalo deserve nominations for their portrayals. The film runs just under 3 hours and can drag when jumping from one suspect to the next, but fans of Fincher as well as those who lived through this nightmare will appreciate the depiction for what it's worth.",Zodiac

Not to say that this flick is bad-- because it is not-- but it just is not quite living up to some of his previous greats (The Game, Fight Club...). The film is a bit of a complicated mess. Multiple main characters make it difficult to really tell you the story from one perspective. The film pretty much covers, in great depth, the case of the ""Zodiac"" serial killer throughout the 60's and 70's. Jake Gyllenhal, Mark Ruffalo and Robert Downey Jr are all the main focus at one time or another. This leads me to my only real problem with the film -- the script. It was unfocused, ramblings of facts, fiction, suspense and odd-ball humor. For much of the film, I felt as if the script was so crazy that I wasn't compelled to even have a reaction. And the period's of time this movie jumps through is ridiculous. Sometimes we go weeks in advance, other times just months. Occasionally we skip over some years; but none the less, we are always skipping around every 10 or so minutes. Pretty good performances, excellent cinematography, and decent direction (beside the script)-- this piece is extremely easy to watch and does draw true fascination from time to time. An interesting experiment with mixed results. Rent it!",Zodiac
738,pinghan,Not Se7en and Fighting Club,7,11 October 2009,"A serial killer movie based on Robert Graysmith's non-fiction book, Zodiac, is directed by David Fincher who has directed several exciting movies including Se7en and Fighting Club. The serial killer, calling himself Zodiac, appeared in North California in late 1960's and killed four men and three women. The case has never been solved, and it has been an open file by the California Department of Justice since 1969. How to tell a story of unsolved case? The movie focused on people who tried to solve the case. Two main groups were pursuing this case, including people from San Francisco Chronicle, a crime reporter Paul Avery(Robert Downey Jr.) and a political cartoonist Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal), and people from San Francisco police, detectives Dave Toschi (Mark Ruffalo) and his partner Bill Armstrong (Anthony Edwards). Since the case has never been totally solved, the movie was about a story how this case changed men's life. Yeas passed and many people's careers changed. Avery left the Chronicle and Armstrong quited the homicide division. Toschi was also demoted. The only one who still investigated was Graysmith. He was obsessed by this case, even if he lost his job and wife and kids. In the end, he claimed he discovered who was the killer, a suspect who was innocent because his DNA did not match the sample from the Zodiac letters. Eventually, he finished his book, Zodiac. The case was still unsolved. If you like David Fincher's Se7en or Fighting Club, you may feel disappointed in the end. The story is not exciting at all. Most time the movie describes how to detect the case and then why it does not work. At the beginning, Zodiac sends some code to Chronicle. Graysmith solves it, but it does not help to solve the case. The killing scenes are not so bloody. There is no police and killer's car-pursuing either. For those who get used the traditional Hollywood detective movies, Zodiac is not their type. So how's else we can see in this movie? More it is about the real life. Some cannot handle the pressure and lost himself in alcohol (Avery). Some decides leaving the position and comes back to family (Armstrong). For those who are still pursuing the case, they rather believe what they believe rather than the evidences. Everyone in this case needs an exit, or a killer no matter it is true or not, to make himself leave. Here shows one problem that the scientific identification was not so reliable in 1960's. Too many evidences may distract the investigation. Another problem is the cooperation between polices in different cities. The bureaucrat defers the evidences communicating around the area. Basically, the movie handled the mood of reality quite well. The real life has a lot of disappointment, imperfect, and frustration. The whole investigation is like Kafka's The Castle; no one can get the end.The movie is quite long (157 minutes) and the non- exciting plot may make people sleepy. However, once you can be patient, the movie will show some truth of the humanity.",Zodiac

It kept me on my toes the entire time and not many movies can achieve that. I don't really have any complaints with the movie except for not really liking Mark Ruffalo as an actor, but that again is a very personal thing. I think this movie is very underrated and hope many more people will see it as it is one of the Fincher's best. I give it 9/10 because of a not very likable but still believable Mark Ruffalo's character and not the best performance in the history of cinema from Jake Gyllenhaal. He has had better movies. But still this movie is one of my all time favorites if we are talking about crime genre. As it is based on real life case files it gives it an extra layer of intensity and is that much more terrifying to watch.",Zodiac
740,cutebunnies567,Awesome movie!!!!!!!!,9,18 August 2013,"""I... I Need to know who he is. I... I need to stand there, I need to look him in the eye and I need to know that it's him."" Zodiac, is a movie about the hunt to find a serial killer who calls himself the Zodiac. Dave Toschio (Mark Ruffalo) is the lead detective from the FBI who initially works the case of the Zodiac killings. Years after the initial case goes cold is when Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal), a cartoonist, actually starts working the case. Paul Avery (Robert Downey Jr.) a comical, alcoholic reporter who worked at the San Francisco Chronicle during the FBI's investigation, and was a colleague of Graysmith, assists him in the investigation. Initially reluctant to help him, Dave decides to give Graysmith access to witnesses and case files on the original investigation. Graysmith slowly begins to realize that as he delves deeper into the case so does his life begin to unravel. He starts getting strange phone calls and messages from an anonymous source. Inspire of this he forges ahead and soon he makes the connection between the first victim and a person of interest, Arthur Leigh Allen (John Carroll Lynch), who was pegged as the best possible suspect for the murders in the original investigation. Unfortunately, no hard evidence could prove that the suspect is indeed the Zodiac INSPITE of a good amount of circumstantial evidence. This case STILL remains open and reminds law enforcement that sometimes there are cases which are probably never meant to or will ever be solved. Arthur Leigh Allen died of a heart attack on August 26 1992.The real Robert Graysmith wrote books on the Zodiac called 'Zodiac' and 'Zodiac Unmasked' that inspired director David Fincher to make the movie.The movie was suspenseful. It left the viewer dazed and wanting answers. The direction was beautiful. Not one part of the movie was slow. The acting was awesome too. This movie should have won an Oscar!!! It was THAT awesome!!! If your looking for a thriller movie that should have you wanting for more, this is DEFINITELY your kind of movie. 😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝",Zodiac
741,rs25,Fincher's best? No. But still very good,8,28 February 2007,"I am tired of people writing comments like this, ""Not Fincher's best"". Honestly who cares. We all agree that Fincher's best is either Seven or Fight Club, two outstanding masterpieces. There is a big margin between a film like one of those and a terrible film, and people don't seem to realize that. These people even do this with other filmmakers like Spielberg or Scorsese, the fact that these filmmakers don't reproduce Schindler's List or Raging Bull doesn't mean that their new stuff isn't good, or worth seeing. I think it is a stupid way to comment on a film, eliminating the critic's credibility. I was lucky enough to catch an advanced screening of Zodiac last night, and I must say that at first I was discouraged by two things, some of the comments I have read and the running time. However I am glad to say that I enjoyed this film, very much. It is a solid suspense thriller that pins you to your seat. Being a true story adds quite a lot to the experience, and besides, Fincher did a wonderful job is staying loyal to the story and at the same time adding his unique flavor to it. The cinematography, like every Fincher film, is great, the darkness and griddiness of the story are perfectly portrayed in the film's visual elements. I was surprised by the picture quality of the Viper, the digital camera with which this film was shot. Many people have been criticizing this choice, but I respect it, he is embracing a new technology and making it work. Of course its still not a match to 35 mm, but if quality filmmakers don't start experimenting with it, it will never be. Now the reason why this film falls behind Seven and Fight Club, I think, is because of a problem with the characters. They seem to be a little weak at times. The performances were great, especially Robert Downey Jr., but I think that this film falls short, when it comes to a true exploration of complex characters, which is the key to Fincher's previous films.So... my advice to everyone is to ignore most of the negative comments and see the film yourself. I found it to be a great story told in a remarkable way, very entertaining, with great performances, and wonderful direction.",Zodiac

Zodiac was well worth the wait, and I'm glad David Fincher took his time with this one. Everything worked-production design,wardrobe,music. In fact, you might think you're watching a movie from the late 60's-70's. The acting was phenomenal, especially Mark Ruffalo and Robert Downey Jr.s performances. They both deserve Oscar nods. But most importantly, you feel like you're part of the investigation, working with these people through every lead, dead-end, obsession, and hope. By the time the credits roll, you'll feel just as drained as these men probably did. And it's definitely not because of the film's length. I was enthralled in this crime saga from start to finish.

744,rigorousobject,Totally worth the three hours,8,4 March 2007,"The movie time was for 6:15. We got out of the car @6:14 and head back to the car @ 9:09. Close to three hours with previews and all. I can't say enough about this movie. It really intrigued me. I was looking all over the internet and the library to find out more about this story. I remember when they caught the copycat killer in New York. About the movie... all the actors were great and they played the characters unbelievably well. I felt really connected to Robert Graysmith (flawlessly played by Jake G.) and his obsession with the case. I'm not a fan of Mark Ruffalo but he was totally believable as a cop in the 70's who was completely frustrated and annoyed by the PD's system in getting everyone involved. It made me want to think... why the heck doesn't the police centralize communication to resolve cases more efficiently. I think the director made it seem like the system was to blame for blurring this case. He did a pretty good job by making all the reporters and policemen jump from town to town to get questions answered that led them nowhere. The movie was completely interesting and it linked good ol' facts about the case. There were some twists that made you feel like you were the reporter/cop trying to figure out the case. It made you question ""who really is the Zodiac killer."" Robert Downey was funny and a pleasure to see back on the screen. He plays the drunken and drugged journalist sooo well. John Carrol Lynch played the questionably eerie- wannabe-normal serial killer ""down to the T."" The interrogation seen was the best seen. Go see it. The stories is great, almost like reading a book, extremely detailed and realistic. I was looking forward to reading Robert Graysmith's book about the Zodiac serial killer. Unfortanely, I had to put a hold on the book in the library b/c it was overdue. Bummer! I gave this an eight because I hate it when they write about future events with no visual. what's another 15-30 minutes after 3 hours? FYI... If you like serial killer drama's check out Dexter on showtime... way cool!!!!",Zodiac
745,wiitigoo,"Not his best, but still pretty good",7,3 August 2016,"Fincher has a typical reputation other filmmakers can only dream of. A part from Alien3 he has only made movies that are loved by critics and fans: The Game, Fight Club, Panic Room, not to mention Se7en. In this film about the hunt for the memorable killer that hit San Francisco in the seventies, Fincher again chooses an original approach, which results in an intriguing movie.Like the aforementioned Se7en Zodiac is also about the hunt for a serial killer. But unlike its predecessor it has quite a different outcome. This time the focus is on the hunters, but the pace their quest progresses in is much lower and a lot less hectic than Se7en. Robert Graysmith (Gyllenhaal) works as a cartoonist at the San Francisco Chronicle. When the news comes out that a serial killer is on the lose, he becomes intrigued. He was initially followed with suspicion by crime reporter Paul Avery (Downey Jr.) and cop David Toschi (Ruffalo), but Graysmith just could not let the Zodiac and its cryptic messages go.With its excessive length of over two and a half hours one would say you get bored at any time in this film. Strangely enough this is not the case. And while the majority consists of talking heads; Graysmith talking about the case with Avery; Toschi who talks about the matter with his colleague Bill (Edwards); Graysmith talking about the case with Toschi; it just does not all sound quite intriguing. But actually it is! The relevant dialogues are strong and certainly contributes to this, but if you're looking for a reason why Zodiac will grab you by the throat, it is the tireless dedication of Fincher. He combines wonderfully good camera work with a very thorough preparation. The script is based on the book by the real Graysmith (must-read!) And Fincher had hours of interviews with the people involved and file cabinets full of stuff figured out.Despite the many cases there is never certainty about the identity of the Zodiac Killer. The Zodiac killer claims thirty-seven people have been killed, but the official figure is 'only' seven or nine. The main suspect died of a heart attack before he was able to be indicted. A mystery that still needs a solution, but probably never will. A good choice therefore, to choose this time to focus on the psychological state of the police and other sleuths. 'Blood and gore'-lovers should not bother. That does not mean that there are no gruesome murders sit in (on the contrary), but gorged gluttons or cut prostitutes are not part of this movie.Fincher said once that he, like the writer and cartoonist Graysmith, had a downright obsession with the serial killer. Se7en is also proof of this. Go see it, you will not be disappointed.",Zodiac

It is far too long and has very few interesting moments. Every time you think it might be moving towards a dramatic conclusion (our heroes catch the killer!) it simply cuts to a few years later and our hapless amateurs carry out a few more investigations which lead... surprise! surprise! ... nowhere.Really the only interesting thing about this movie is how it managed to get such a high rating on these pages.

At no point does this movie even attempt to keep the viewer interested, except maybe whenever the killer is shown. Rest seems like same scenes playing again and again through different cast members. Even the dialogues become repetitive!! Funnily,At some point, even major cast members turn away from the case and do not appear again. Rest, seem to be doing so unwillingly. Only the author in the movie, seems the most interested since its based on his book.

The case may have been on the newspaper reports throughout the late 60s and the early 70s, but Fincher's direction adds a new dimension for viewers, the lived experience of anyone living during that time and near those scenes of crime.

All the details that they went through to recreate the crimes. The way it looks the way it plays out, the clothes, the cars, and the dialogue the whole crew went out there way to do it justice and recreate what the crimes looked exactly like. They even got access to files of the real case to make sure it's as close as it can be.
The direction in this movie is great, all the scenes are very well crafted and all the acting is amazing, this one of my favourite Jake Gyllenhaal performances. Also the editing in this movie is very good the scenes flow so naturally that I forgot I was actually watching a movie.
Finally this is the most tense suspenseful scary movie I've ever seen so far, all the phone calls send chills down my spine, all the attacks are horrible and are realistic, I actually had to look away a few times and I'm used to blood and killing but something about this just makes me cringe.If I had to say something wrong with this is that I think the movie is a bit too long, it might be because I watched the directors cut but it's a bit long.

There's nothing entertaining about it, fast cuts, instant gratification of stupid special effects that have nothing to do with the story or the content of the film.

754,zombislayer001,"frightening, engrossing account of the hunt for a notorious Bay Area killer",10,3 March 2007,"As a rule, movies about real-life, unsolved murders tend to be -- by their unresolved nature -- not very satisfying, which is probably why none of the dozens of films based on the Jack the Ripper story over the years have been particularly memorable.We had a perfect example of this last fall with ""The Black Dahlia,"" Brian De Palma's historically reckless and disastrously over-the-top film-noir fabrication based on Los Angeles' most celebrated unsolved murder of the '40s.But ""Zodiac,"" David Fincher's scrupulously factual drama about the determined serial killer who eluded Northern California police for more than two decades, manages to be an absorbing and fulfilling experience -- even though it ends with a question mark.Its story begins July 4, 1969, with a terrifying scene right out of ""Bonnie and Clyde,"" as a young couple parked in a lonely spot near the town of Vallejo is attacked by a gunman who unleashes a hail of bullets, killing the girl and wounding the boy.The next day, letters arrive at the San Francisco Chronicle and other newspapers from a man claiming responsibility and calling himself ""Zodiac."" He includes a coded message and instructions that the letter be printed on the front page, or more murders will follow.Thus begins a saga that will cover decades and include 20 more letters taunting the police (and threatening mass murder of children), 47 possible victims (no one knows for sure how many) and enough clues and suspects to fill a 10-hour miniseries.The film's first half, which dramatizes Zodiac's more famous killings, his cat-and-mouse interplay with Chronicle reporter Paul Avery (Robert Downey Jr.) and the crisis his crimes create in the Chronicle board room, makes for the best newspaper movie since ""All the President's Men.""The second half takes place in later years, as Zodiac becomes inactive, the police lose interest and the case becomes the personal obsession of two men: S.F. cop Dave Toschi (Mark Ruffalo) and Chronicle political cartoonist Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal).Graysmith, who spent 30 years researching the case and wrote two books about it that were the basis of the script, gradually puts all the information of the competing Bay Area police departments together, finds clues of his own and makes a convincing case for Zodiac's identity.The movie is rather long (two hours, 38 minutes) and often demanding, with a vast tapestry of characters and incidents. And it loses some of its frantic pace and dramatic coherence -- and throws in an unneeded red herring or two -- in its final act.But, overall, it works. Fincher has crafted a true-crime epic: a sprawling, ambitious, no- nonsense drama that rejects most of the clichés of the serial-killer formula and comes together as a mystery, an ensemble character study and a ""Da Vinci Code""-like puzzle movie.Above all else, ""Zodiac"" is a dazzling period piece that manages, in almost every scene, to eerily capture the mood of its principal era -- the '70s -- and shrewdly comments on how the computer has made it as distant to us as the Middle Ages.",Zodiac
755,fromhell,A relevant thriller about the nature of fear.,10,20 November 2007,"The Zodiac murders remain today one of California's most famous unsolved crimes. David Fincher has given us something quite special here. From the outset, attention to detail is mesmerizing, making multiple viewings a must for full appreciation. The filmmakers were deeply fascinated with the events spawned by some seemingly unmotivated killings north of the Bay Area, that with the help of the media, eventually brought a crippling fear across the entire state. The story is told from the perspective of the media covering the events (who received penned letters and cyphers from someone claiming to be the killer), a cop trying to catch the perpetrator, and an artist trying to make sense of it all. Various scenes take us on a ill-fated date on Lover's Lane, to an on-call cop in the middle of the night trying to comprehend a murder scene, a newsroom where editors debate ethics and business, and a lonely apartment filled with boxes of documents that may hide an answer to a terrible mystery.

It is nice see how the police handled such a case in the late 60's and early 70's, and it is interesting and authentic.Unfortunately, the movie also has the pace of a movie of the 60's. I appreciate that a real case does not follow Hollywood timing rules, but when I realized (after an hour) that I had to sit through another 1.5 hour, it took most of the joy out of it. The movie could easily have been cut to under two hours. Irrelevant discussions and bad (often no) cutting drags this movie along.Also, the movie is extremely focused on the case. That might be good for the suspense, but the rest of the world seems to go by, and time goes by, and you see nothing of either, no context is drawn.Because of that, in the end it is just an average good movie and frankly it is quite forgettable.",Zodiac

It's very, very accurate. If you don't know anything about the story, or don't care, and just want to see a good movie, go for it.

760,jeverage,Pleasantly Surprised,8,4 March 2007,"Zodiac is as much a horror film as Barney's Great Adventure is a documentary. Most of the footage in the ads takes place in the first half-hour of the movie, and is occasionally touched upon later throughout. Now, all that said, those few murder scenes are not afraid to show the violence, so it's still not something for children to watch.The rest of the movie focuses on cartoonist Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal), his colleague Paul Avery (Robert Downey Jr.), and several detective agencies as they attempt to track down the infamous Zodiac killer.The movie takes place across a span of about 20 or so years, jumping forward as new evidence emerges. It's based quite faithfully on the real Zodiac killings and the investigations that followed. The film is actually based on the book written by the real Robert Graysmith.The acting throughout the film is very impressive, especially on the part of Gyllenhaal, who manages to convincingly depict Graysmith's plunge from a simple cartoonist, to an obsessive man who begins to neglect his own family in his desperate search for the identity of the Zodiac. Gyllenhaal wasn't the greatest actor in the film however, my personal favorite was that of Robert Downey Jr., who plays Paul Avery. Avery is the polar opposite of Graysmith, instead of plunging deeper and deeper into the Zodiac case, he simply drinks himself into oblivion. Downey Jr. is very animated throughout his performance, and is very reminiscent of his role as Jim Barris in 2006's A Scanner Darkly. One of my only complaints about the movie is that Downey's character is criminally underused. His talents as an actor far surpass the screen time he receives in this movie.One complaint many people seem to have with Zodiac is that it's too long. Clocking in at about 2 and a half hours, it's no slouch in the length department. It's a very compelling 2 and a half hours though, and I had no problem sitting there and watching this case unfold. I encourage those who see it to do so without any prior research on the Zodiac. The less you know about what really happened, the more you'll enjoy this movie. That's not to say it's inaccurate, but I walked in knowing several things about the Zodiac's murders, and felt it detracted a little from the overall experience. Nothing to write home about of course, but there's nonetheless more enjoyment to be had when you don't know how the story will play out.I was particularly interested in seeing how the movie would end. It's no secret that the Zodiac case was never officially solved. They did a very good job with it though, they leave with satisfying closure without giving any definitive answers. One could make a very compelling argument that the final scene is one of the best in the film. Graysmith walks up to the man he believes is the Zodiac. The man looks at Graysmith, smiles, and says ""Can I help you?"". Graysmith simply replies ""No...No it's alright..."", but continues to stare at him. The man's smile fades, suggesting that he might know what's going on, but again no answers are given. The camera moves to Graysmith once again, watches him for a moment, and the movie closes.Overall, Zodiac was a very pleasant surprise, and I would encourage anyone remotely interested in a well-crafted Crime Drama to take a look. Ignore the ads, ignore the media hype. Zodiac is a much better film than it's given credit for.",Zodiac

The movie was a let down because of the lack of a good ending (although based on a true story). The final scene of the 2 hour and 50 minute movie ended in a hurry with 5 pages of writing to explain how the story really ends. I felt it lacked any type of climax and definitely left you without a feeling of conflict resolution.A cooler part of the movie was that it had cryptograms and puzzles, but that turned out to be a let down because there was no real action within the movie that delt with the puzzles that the serial killer was leaving.

The performances by the cast reflected the characters with decency. I think this is because people still know those involved in the Zodiac murders, and the actors probably even got to meet those still alive. Therefore the cast had little to scope to, experiment, or make the character as full as, Hugh Laurie's Greg House, or Eugene Levy as Jim's Dad in the American Pie series. It would be totally inappropriate.I enjoyed the film, especially the soundtrack. The cinematography was excellent, especially following the taxi along the city streets, turning with the vehicle making it seem as if I was playing a computer game, like Grand Theft Auto.Mark Ruffalo for me did performed best of the actors, even though I feel he was trying to appear like Peter Falk's Columbo with that rain coat! I was expecting him to say,"" and just one more thing."" ""I got it here somewhere."" Or drag on a stale cigar! I must admit, (and hence why I scored it 7 out of 10,) I felt the ending dragged. This is something I don't feel will be a problem when the film comes out on DVD. But in the cinema I did get conscious that I had been sat still for a while, and the pace of the film in the last quarter slowed down.Overall a good film.",Zodiac
770,michaelabrittain,"A Film with a Beginning, an ENDLESS middle & a few footnotes.",2,6 July 2020,"This is a film of dead-ends & false leads.
Unfortunately the biggest false lead & dead end is the film itself.
At 151 minutes running time it feels, by it's conclusion, as if someone who had promised to take you somewhere had finally pulled up into a lay-by & said ""That's it!""
It's 2 & 1/2 hours of frustrated people getting more frustrated & leaving you......guess what.........?
A long story which ends with ""in the end it might be this or that or the other but we'll never know for sure."" is just a long wind-up. The objection; ""But it's based on real life events!"" only means that it would make suitable material for an interesting documentary, perhaps on the frustrations of inconclusive police investigations.
Documentary, or even Docu-drama material it might be, but as a movie it leaves you as cheesed off & thwarted as every single one of it's depressed & disillusioned protagonists who, understandably fall out with each other in utter weariness & despair.
It's no spoiler to mention that one detective quits the case eventually, basically because it's not getting anywhere - I wish he could have warned the rest of us before the film started then we could have done the same!
To make a worthwhile story or movie, it should have a Beginning, a Middle & an End whereas THIS specimen has a Beginning, an endless middle & a couple of speculative footnotes!
I'm not faulting the performances, or the casting, which is (sometimes painfully) appropriate - hence the two stars. For a PRODUCER, however, it is critical to be able to distinguish twixt what makes suitable story/film material & what might be best told, detail by chafing detail, in an honest documentary.
A big waste of a LOT of time.",Zodiac
771,Ankylosaurus,Plays like the best dramatic re-enactment.,10,2 March 2007,"This movie is told in the style of a dramatic re-enactment, meaning everything happens as it happened in real life and Fincher ignores his right as director to invent the points where drama (as opposed to fact) might be inclined to steer itself. Watching Zodiac is like watching a special investigation on TV- special time is spent on the more incriminating and substantial evidence, but a great deal is spent on the leads that go nowhere. This is my favorite part of the movie (and where others find it the most frustrating). It is intended to contain the same hopelessly muddled feeling throughout for an audience that is aware that this case will always be somewhat of a mystery. My shocking interest lies in all the true things that had to occur for this case to be such an overwhelmingly impossible burden even when a serial killer is screaming for attention. To name a few without giving anything away, the bureaucracy of the police department demands cohesion between at least three city PDs, the publicity of the case leaves police with an infinite number of suspects given as tips, and their handwriting expert is called into question on several counts.Add to all of that the inspired performance of Robert Downey Jr. among a huge cast of talents, the intricate details of Los Angeles culture and that of the 70s, and our own driven obsession identifying with Graysmith and we have an incredible film. Keep in mind, however, that some of us will never be able to watch a 2hr 40min dramatic re-enactment.",Zodiac

I am sure that they are not the traditional ""cigarette burns"" that denote the end of a reel but are something a bit more intriguing.... Anyone else have another idea or more information?

It opens and closes the storyline which is a beautiful detail. And it's little details like this that make this movie good.For me the only apparent weakness of the movie is that it moves unusually slow sometimes evem to slow. I can imagine that some might take a disliking in the ending, but this is to the obvious limitations that come with a movie based on true events.I personally was surprisingly pleased with the ending, but if I am really honest I must admit that the score is the main reason why I liked it so much. It just caught me completely of guard when the song that played (as mentioned previously ""Hurdy Gurdy Man"" by Donovan) in the opening scene while the first murder happened returned in the end sequence. It is a simple trick but it ties the storyline together in a beautiful way.Another big positive is the acting and I assume even the Marvel casting crew can vouch for me as all lead roles are filled with actors that also play a role in the MCU.",Zodiac

Having read a lot of the reviews here, everyone seems to be divided in two. Love it...hate it. Which way will you go?Yes, it's long. But let's face it, this is not a film that can be wrapped up in an hour and a half. There's an awful lot of detail involved in this case. David Fincher was very thorough in his research and full marks to him. This is an excellent, compelling film for anyone interested in true crime and general detective work.I saw this film a few hours ago and was completely absorbed by it. The opening 4th of July sequence is worthy of the ticket price alone. And I challenge anyone to listen to ""Hurdy Gurdy Man"" by Donovan without a cold chill running down their spine after watching this...The main performances are excellent - Robert Downey Jr and Jake Gyllenhaal in particular are a standout. Any feminists out there won't be happy with the rather one-dimensional women's roles (and I happen to be female), but this is not what this film is about. It's about a handful of men's obsessive involvement with one case. And these men ARE utterly obsessed. And after so much taunting by the Zodiac with his letters and cyphers, who can blame them for their obsession? As for the depiction of the murders, they are quite shocking in their brief brutality with absolutely no glamorous or excessive lingering shots of the aftermath. This makes them infinitely more real and much more disturbing...Combine this with utterly believable dialogue, a superb soundtrack and marvellous production design and you have one classy movie. For all those tired of your average eye and brain-candy fodder...Go see. For those who can't appreciate a class act when you see it, you've missed out...",Zodiac

Some of these films include: La Vie en Rose, Into the Wild, Gone Baby Gone, Paprika, Knocked Up, and many more. After seeing these films, Zodiac still remains the best film of the year. I know I still have a few months left before the end of the year. And I am not bashing these other movies. These other movies are all great and most will be in my top movies of the year, but David Fincher has made a masterpiece here. A lot of people will not like it as much as Se7en or Fight Club, but I think it is equal, if not better, than those two. It is a different kind of film for Fincher because it is not so blood splattered. It is slower but just as intense. The acting is superb. Everything about this movie is just great.

However this movie is not with out its flaws it can be difficult to understand at times which may distract the viewer, and I feel that Anthony Edwards was not right for his role however small it may be (and I'm a huge Anthony Edwards fan by the way), but these are small flaws that are mostly opinionated.

However, the movie takes a turn down an investigative lane that only people with interest in this particular case would love and the rest would just fall asleep.As for the acting, I can not say much for Jake Gyllenhaal or Robert Downey Jr. because they play roles that I feel wasn't much of a challenge -- they play themselves, especially Downey Jr. in the role of a cracked out alcoholic. But, I was impressed with Mark Ruffalo, as this is easily one of his better performances.The bottom line is: If you're looking to be entertained with a murder mystery with thrills and suspense... watch something else.

I do not think that it is as good as the two aforementioned titles, but those are amongst my favorite movies, so not topping those is not in anyway a bad thing.I would like to start by saying that the performances were all great. Gyllenhaal, Ruffalo, and Downey Jr. were all superb, as were the rest of the cast. This movie did a great job of recreating the era of the 1970s, making it a nice period piece. Perhaps not as good as a movie like L.A. Confidential, but it is still very good.Some people have said ""The ending wasn't good enough"" blah blah blah. Well, it was a real story, so do you want Fincher to change the story around and add in a nice twist? What I liked a lot, was that he was able to create suspense in certain moments (basement scene, Zodiac's killing scenes, Leigh's questioning), while still staying true to what was given to him.All in all, this was an excellent film.

Zodiac tells about the Zodiac Killer in California back in the 1960s and 1970s. Before this movie came out I never heard of the Zodiac Killer or anything like that. This movie brings you a lot of details about the case. I liked Robert Downey Jr's performance because I like the personality of his character. John Carroll Lynch even though his role is short gives a very CREEPY performance as Arthur Leigh Allen. When I watched it I got this dark feeling in the movie, even in the very beginning I got this feeling that it was gonna be a dark film. It puts you in this feeling that its dark and the music plays a good part in it, I liked how the music went with the movie. I think the editing was excellent and it told the story very well.",Zodiac

789,Darklightt,A Masterful Hybrid Film! Part 1,8,9 June 2007,"First Take: As a long time fan of Fincher's films, especially Se7en, I went to Zodiac with the assumption that it was going to be like his other films. Bad idea. Zodiac is completely different than anything Fincher has previously directed. But make no mistake: Zodiac is a great film. Not only on the crime/police genre, but as a film in general. If you haven't yet seen it. See it. It's that good.Dark, moody, with the uncanny ability to get under your skin, Zodiac screams Fincher right from the opening scene. Differing in its incredible detailed and studious effort. Going from the creepy, and brutal killing of two teenagers in the beginning and plunging into the cop world of 1960's-'70's it becomes clear that Zodiac is not a straight thriller or suspense film, but an intense police procedural, a dramatic character study of the four men who were most affected by the Zodiac murders, as well as frequent splashes of classic white knuckled Fincher suspense.I must be honest, at first I thought I didn't like this movie. But now I realize that was only because I made had an expectation in mind before I saw it. One of the most prolific complaints I have heard is Zodiac's running time.At nearly three hours, the film is not for those who simply wanted to be entertained and their emotions pampered. One of the reasons, the film is so great is that it is almost three hours long, realizing that as with Se7en, Fight Club, and Panic Room, Fincher is a master at making the audience feel what he wants them to feel. One come out of the theater, feeling like a cop, a reporter, and a common civilian who has spent 22 years tracking and chronicling a sadistic monster who has managed to slip through their fingers at every turn.",Zodiac

My friend and I kept looking at each other asking if the other wanted to leave. Well, after nearly two hours of agony, we finally agreed. I couldn't make it to the end. I don't know how long this movie is but it became excruciating after about an hour and a half. The first 45 minutes were okay but it dropped off a cliff after that. I've only left two other movies in the past, one was Romeo Must Die, and the other was The Addams Family (when I was younger). Save your money and catch this one when it comes out on DVD. Don't blame me if you want to hang yourself for dishing out the cash to watch this one.",Zodiac
791,grifross,Jake Gyllenhall needs a razor!!,10,3 April 2007,"A great movie, but Jake Gyllenhall annoyed me all through the film - not for his acting, which was just fine, but for that anachronistic 4-day beard that never changed one iota through some nine years of movie time, not from day to day, month to month, or year to year. Nor did he ever look a day older. Everyone else in the film ages but him! There he was at the SF Chronicle in 1969, a time (and place) when, if you wanted a straight job, you'd better be clean-shaved or neatly trimmed, yet he sports this scruffy look that didn't come into fashion for another 15 years or so.

The director should have made it a horror movie because it was intense without having the gore or disturbing images that are so common today. The rest of the movie was interesting, but after about two hours of Jake Gyllenhaal talking with various people about the zodiac it becomes a little repetitive. Also, the movie took place over several years and there were about 30 times where it jumped such as ""5 minutes later""....""40 seconds later"".....""3 years later"". It becomes quite confusing. All in all, fun, but not provocative and much too long.",Zodiac
793,danielrgriffin,Crime Collection,7,28 February 2007,"To my knowledge, there have only been three music video directors in the last decade who have successfully made the transition to making interesting feature films: Michel Gondry, Spike Jonze, and David Fincher. The former two have since focused their features on dream worlds and bizarre comedies, with both directing Charlie Kaufman-penned films in the recent past. But Fincher has strayed from the dreamlike quality of music videos and explored the ugly underbelly of human existence with Se7en, The Game, Fight Club, and Panic Room.Zodiac is Fincher's latest film, and it revisits the genre of one of his most popular films, Se7en: the crime drama. However, Zodiac is developed through the use of not one approach to the overworked genre, but three.We have an expansive cast here that Fincher takes advantage of by switching the focus of his film multiple times. The story of course focuses on the real life serial killer in San Francisco who named himself Zodiac, but we see the progression of the story though different character angles.The film jolts along its long running time by skipping chunks of time that are seemingly irrelevant to the story about the Zodiac. Here the narrative is fixed in a progressive timeline of Zodiac activity, yet the timeline is developed through the use of three connected films.The first is the story of a newspaper, the San Francisco Chronicle, who receives Zodiac's first encoded letter that explains the details of his first murders. The police are vaguely involved but the paper takes it upon themselves to investigate this killer. We are given an entertaining first look at Zodiac's first string of murders.The second is the detective story. Here are two partnered cops rabidly attempting to track down Zodiac, much like in Se7en. Yet despite their obsession over the case, he seemingly falls through their fingers multiple times. And again, in this film, from the lack of physical evidence.The third is the noir story. Jake Gyllenhaal becomes our noir protagonist, leading us back through the multiple case files that the detectives never knew about or never clued the audience in on. He becomes, as all noir protagonists do, increasingly obsessed about the resolution of the Zodiac crimes. Noir, simply put, encompasses the genre where the protagonist is thrown into an unusual situation and must sort his way out. And the audience simply follows the protagonist through all his breakthroughs and breakdowns.What's interesting in Zodiac is not the individual parts of the film, but the film in its entirety. The seamless way that Fincher transitions between the three narrative styles, creating a complete film greater than the sum of its parts. And we have our narrative connections through plot cohesion and repetitive characters common in each piece: mainly Robert Downey Jr. and Elias Koteas.And Fincher's not stupid. He realizes the potential of using both actors, mainly Downey, as anchors in time progression. Their characters bend to fit the narrative style, creating layers of genre characters within one character developed through the passing of time. And even more interesting in differentiating the narratives is the use of different actors to play Zodiac for each different story. You can never see their faces but their appearance and voice are slightly different, marking both the change in narrative and in plot where later, Zodiac's claimed murders cannot be directly linked to just one man.My only detraction from Zodiac would be the obvious lack of Fincher's visual style from his previous films. We're missing the roaming CG shots and crispness from both Fight Club and Panic Room, but his excellent use of dark lighting, thankfully, is still present. And he does manage to create one of the most entertaining and shortest 2 hour and 40 minute films in its place, which is a high honor for a film within the hackneyed genre of the crime drama.",Zodiac
794,starbata,This is the Zodiac Speaking,10,1 March 2007,"The movie is excellent, almost as good as Fight Club (and certainly much better Panic Room). The performances are solid as well. Most impressive--especially for someone who has read a lot about the Zodiac Killer and lived in the Bay Area, I was impressed with how the movie stuck to only the verifiable facts and didn't take much ""artistic license"" for the sake of making it more dramatic or Hollywood friendly (ala Oliver Stone). And David Fincher is a master at filming these precisions scenes that really capture the environment and unease. The soundtrack is excellent too, although it's a shame that all the songs are from that period because something like ""This is the Zodiac Speaking"" by Pleasure Forever would be an obvious choice to be included.",Zodiac

The Zodiac was a unknown killer who has not been captured yet and should be in his 70s now. This killer was thought to be a ex military member. This is a documentary that all should know about. This man killed so many people and they should be remembered by this movie and the one before it. Remember this serial killer is still at large and needs to be caught. They even had a episode on AMW (Americas Most Wanted). I think this movie it to get the killer to respond but if the killer is as smart as he he was in the 90's will stay anonymous.,Zodiac

Power to the people,9,3 March 2007,"Zodiac was a fun movie, a little long in the dialog, but had some humorous moments and very spirited moments before savage murders. Does very little to restore faith in humanity. Robert Downey Jr. was a delight in his role as intrepid reporter. The Jake Gyllenhaal character was relentless in pursuing facts about the case against all odds. Even the stilted dialog couldn't dampen the tone of grade A acting. I did feel compassion for the characters even if one guy involved wanted to blow away people for the fame of it. I liked the direction, camera angles, set designs. There was some voiced regrets towards the press. Most of the witnesses were flawed people who just wanted to get out of the way. It seems to pay off in a modest way.

It doesn't even feel like any of his other films. Se7en, Fightclub are true classics. But Zodiac just doesn't work . The pacing of the movie is so off that it's nonexistent. The acting is standard. There is no drama, no tension. The only highlight is the cinematography which looks like a moving Robert Bechtle painting.

I was pleased when Gyllenhaal and Ruffalo were able to drive this movie to the very last second. Though it started with a couple of horrific murders, I later realized the necessity of those scenes to introduce the characters. The transformation of Graysmith, Gyllenhaal, was splendid and allowed myself to be glued to the screen.The language wasn't terrible, maybe a few ""f"" bombs scattered throughout, but not noticeable, and I didn't observe any sensuality.If you're into documentaries, not that this is one, or just love a well done crime movie, I would recommend this movie, and that you take me, so I can see it again.",Zodiac

801,drkness-2,One of David Fincher's Worst,2,5 March 2007,"Saw Zodiac this past weekend and was bored out of my mind. The movie is a lethargic mess. Lots of scenes go nowhere and lots of characters go nowhere.Here's how I would rate the movie against other David Fincher titles: Se7en = 10... Fightclub = 9... The Game = 7.... Panic Room = 6.75... Zodiac = 2 ... Alien 3 = 1.5. I can't believe all the people who are rating Zodiac with 9's and 10's. Do they honestly believe Zodiac is as good or better than Se7en or Fightclub?My girlfriend and I didn't like the movie at all. I could understand if people were rating this movie in the Panic Room/ Game range of 6 to 7. I wouldn't agree with them at all but at least I could see it as a difference of opinion. But rating this as one of the greatest movies of all time... come on, we are doing movie goers a disservice by over inflating our ratings. People should be skeptical.The average movie goer will find this movie slow, disjointed and cold.",Zodiac
802,metalplayz,Engrossing film. Kodos to Fincher!,8,5 March 2007,"This film is long at over 2 hours (nearly 2.5) but I was not bored at all during this very engrossing film. It was also kind of gritty. You got a sense of the realism of it all. It's like ""Ya, I'm watching a real movie."" It just feels like a true story. It starts off with some violence that is excellently portrayed. It really sucks you in. This jumps you straight into the hunt for the Zodiac character, which is where you'll meet the cast of newsies and some cops on the case. God I love Robert Downey. God bless the dude for hanging in there with his excellent career. They guy is good. So were Jake Gyllenhaal and Mark Ruffalo. OK so the plot thickens as we see what this Zodiac can do and how he operates. There are a few scenes that can get you squirming in your seat, like at the park but it only solidifies your desire to see that this peace of work gets what's comin to him. As you move through some time lines, quite a lot of time actually, you start to think that this guy may never get caught. It's freakin depressing. You'll feel for the Robert Graysmith character and Inspector David Toschi, especially Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal ) who at times is in a near frenzy to bring this guy to justice, nearly single-handedly. I'd love to say more but this is the type of movie that it seems like anything you say will give away too much. I can tell you its long, excellently made, acted and directed. Gritty and engrossing describe it best I think.",Zodiac
803,kleeize,Zodiac goes nowhere,2,9 March 2007,"If you thought Se7en and Fightclub were cool you probably want to go see the latest film from the same director, Zodiac. Let me warn you, you will be disappointed. Se7en had some amazing photography, true star power with Brad Pitt, and a blow-you-away twist ending. Zodiac has none of that. The photography is a departure from every other David Fincher film. Certainly it is less flashy. The style is stripped down, muted, simplified, and in my opinion, ultimately numbing.Although all the actors are competent, no one gives an amazing classic performance like Morgan Freeman in Se7en. None of the cast comes close to what Brad Pitt accomplished in Se7en or Fightclub. Pitt is just a more interesting actor to watch; Pitt has the ability to surprise you. Robert Downey as Paul Avery is fun to watch but you've seen him do this role before. All the actors in Zodiac seem to be playing the same note. The script doesn't help them. For example, we never really find out why the Zodiac case was so different for the Mark Ruffalo character, Inspector David Toschi, from any of the other murder cases he had seen. Why did it affect him the way it did?; we really never know. The Jake Gyllenall character, Robert Graysmith, loses everything to his obsessive pursuit of the Zodiac, yet it is hard to care about what he loses (his wife, his children as they leave him) since we hardly see him interact with his family. Each of the three main characters lives are badly developed. It is like watching the abbreviated version of the cliff notes depicting their lives. Zodiac shows what each character did and leaves out what each character was thinking and feeling. Characters are introduced and dropped for seemingly no reason. For example, why was Adam Goldberg's character ever introduced as Paul Avery's replacement? I never felt an emotional attachment to anybody in the film.As for the ending -- There is no ending. The movie just stops. You're led to believe that the Zodiac was probably a suspect whose handwriting and DNA samples didn't even match the evidence.The Zodiac case seemed to go nowhere and so does the movie. Amazingly, that seems to be what the filmmaker intended.",Zodiac
804,zxzx66,Read the negative reviews before you waste your time,1,9 March 2007,"Se7en and Fighclub are great movies. David Fincher's latest, Zodiac, has been getting great reviews. I couldn't wait to see the movie. About an hour or so into it, I couldn't wait for it to end. It really angered me. I kept thinking, how could so many critics love this? How come I'm hating it so much?The film doesn't look or feel like previous David Fincher films. I guess it's commendable that he's trying to do something different. The movie, though, isn't good. I'm convinced, that if he had used a pseudonym, the exact same movie would not have gotten the reviews that it did. David Fincher's reputation gives him some kind of pass from the majority of film critics. If the exact same movie was listed as being directed by someone like Gary Fleder the same critics would probably be calling this movie out for the long winded pointless choppy unemotional anti-thriller that it is.I've never seen a movie in which I so disagreed with the reviews that I had read. So I went back and instead of skimming the reviews for whether the reviewer liked it or not (the majority of reviewers did like the movie even if they thought it was too long), I read the details and later found a lot of negative reviews.Go to a site like rottentomatoes.com and read some of the negative reviews; even the favorable reviewers write things like ""overlong and lacking dramatic focus too short on suspense lapses in storytelling that don't seem like bold artistic choices the movie's a sprawling mess zodiac was an interminable bore there's something strangely flat and enervating about the picture exhaustion kicks in to the point where we're not sure what we're looking at an exercise in frustration I've never seen a movie so full of dead ends one of the dullest of these films to date. Zodiac runs an astonishing two hours and 40 minutes, and it feels like it."" Each one of those quotes is from a different review.These reviews sum up for me the movie that I experienced. I wish I had read them before I had wasted almost three hours on Zodiac.",Zodiac
805,wilker-2,Inept. No suspense. No thrills.,1,9 March 2007,"Zodiac is being sold as a suspense thriller but it has no suspense and no thrills. It's really more of a police procedural but as such it is just inept.One character is introduced as someone who may or may not have been an eyewitness having possibly ridden as a passenger in the Zodiac's car. Yet as soon as she is introduced, we never see her again in the movie. There are no scenes of her describing the Zodiac and how that description may or may not help the police investigation.There's another character who is introduced who's handwriting is the closest match to Zodiac's handwriting on the letters that have been received by the Examiner. Yet after only one scene in the movie that character is never seen again. Why didn't the Graysmith character follow that up?I'd like to think that in the real life case those two characters played a part in the Zodiac mystery. Yet in the movie they're chopped into the story and then dropped for no apparent reason.This is clunky story telling, plain and simple. The movie just doesn't work and I found it to be a frustrating bore.",Zodiac
806,gamblur,We want our money back,1,17 March 2007,"At the end of Zodiac my friends and I looked at each other and said, ""We want our money back.""In addition to the price of admission, we wasted almost three hours of our time on this long winded bore.At the center of the film is Jake Gyllenhaal's performance as a cartoonist obsessed with the Zodiac murders. None of us found him believable in the role.The movie lacks any kind of forward drive. It just sits there piling on pieces of circumstantial evidence. Sometimes the characters follow the trail of evidence to a dead end. Sometimes the evidence uncovered is just left behind and never followed up. Were the leads left behind by the characters or were they left behind by the filmmakers? You don't really know. The storytelling loses focus and we just stopped caring.So we'd like to ""thank"" everyone who gave this movie a 10 rating and influenced our decision to see this dull lifeless movie. Did you really think this was one of the best movies of all time? We actually thought it was one of the worst we'd seen in a long time.",Zodiac
807,truewest-2,"Dull movie. Dull, Dull, Dull.",1,17 March 2007,"Is there some kind of David Fincher fan club stuffing the ballot box here at IMDb with 10 ratings? This director can make a great film. This isn't it. Not even close.All these over-rated reviews can't save the movie from bombing at the box office It must infuriate all of those in the Fincher Fan Club that your crowned prince of darkness can't connect with the current cultural zeitgeist like he did so many years ago with Se7en (now THAT was a truly great film). Is the director being misjudged by the culture or is the director misjudging the culture. I say the latter. In any case, this movie doesn't seem to be resonating with a large audience. Why?Because it's a dull movie. Dull, Dull, Dull. You never get inside the characters' heads. You don't care about them. The actors performances are standard. If there is an interesting story here, the movie doesn't find it. At two hours and forty minutes it is too long.I just read one 10 rated IMDb review that described Gyllenhaal's performance as unmemorable and flat. How do you give a movie a perfect 10 review then call the central performance of the film unmemorable and flat. Does that make any sense at all?You know, it's okay to criticize a favorite director if he makes a dud. If you praise one of his worst movies as a perfect movie, you are only hastening the director's slide into mediocrity.My advice to the general movie-goer is to disregard any review rating this movie a 9 or 10.I would have probably rated Zodiac a 5 or 6 but to compensate for all the bogus 10 ratings I'm rating it a 1.",Zodiac
808,donald-breeden,A profound movie for thriller/suspense movie fanatics!!!!,10,17 March 2007,"Zodiac is a must see for action/suspense movie fans. The ambiance of the movie is captivating. The setting: San Francisco embracing the era of counter culture (love not war) is shocked by the Zodiac's messages and killings. However, as a member of the audience you get to take a cinematic ride with San Francisco's best investigators, police officers, and newspaper reporters. The psychedelic music from the 60s and 70s is perfect for the murder scenes. It keeps you on the edge of your seats. The murder scenes are graphic but, just enough to get the bizarre, psychopathic emotion of the Zodiac killer across. The movie also has artistic views of San Francisco and the bay area that are enlightening and mesmerizing. I highly recommend this movie for all those interested in the mysterious story of the elusive Zodiac killer. Check it out. You will not be disappointed. Two thumbs up. Good job.",Zodiac
809,sterf,All the drama and suspense of an autopsy.,1,17 March 2007,"Watching Zodiac is like watching an autopsy. You get to watch the movie dissect the Zodiac case. Parts of evidence are dumped in front of you to look at. The parts pile up as the movie drags on and on and on until you can't stand it anymore. The movie beats any mystery out of the story as it hacks through fact after fact. After almost three hours the movie stops. The movie doesn't really have an ending, it just stops. Like an autopsy the dissected parts don't tell even a fraction of the story of a life lived. You will not make any emotional connection to any of the characters.Save yourself three hours of agonizing boredom. Skip The Zodiac.",Zodiac
810,smrtmeter,"Tedious, Lifeless Presentation of Evidence & Dead Ends",1,18 March 2007,This movie is not a thriller. It is not a suspense movie. It doesn't attempt to be a visceral experience. It tries to be a cerebral dissertation on the inability of man to solve a mystery; of the futile attempt of man to try and understand the world through the collection of facts. Then it cops out on its premise by presenting to us the probable killer.Almost 3 hours of a tedious lifeless presentation of evidence & dead ends -- and then the movie sells out its own intentions. If the movie had any guts it would have left the case unsolved. It would not have made this movie watchable but at least you could say that it was uncompromising.,Zodiac
811,jenstone-2,Wouldn't Recommend Zodiac,5,18 March 2007,"Can't really say I enjoyed Zodiac. It started fairly decent then lost momentum half way through. Not especially gory which is a good thing. Not especially exciting either. The story jumps around from the murders to each of the three main characters (the cartoonist, the news reporter, the detective) so it feels it a little disjointed. You never really connect with any of the characters. The movie is not really about the people investigating the Zodiac but the investigation itself. This is when the story really bogs down. Could have cut an hour out of Zodiac as the second half really drags. Overall, just a blah kind of movie.",Zodiac

So, if anyone would know how please if you could help get me in contact with him or a representative for the movie or Mr. Fincher, that would be appreciated.This was the first time that I lived what my mom went threw, always it was a story, a scary story, but watching this movie was like seeing what a woman had went threw, I was scared for her, not as my mom but woman to woman.

813,wlrdtrvlr,Bore-Fest,1,19 March 2007,"The story of the Zodiac could have been interesting but this movie proved to be a two hour and forty minute bore-fest. Most of the movie is spent on the investigation as scene after scene piles on pieces of evidence for the characters to ponder. The movie tries (and fails) to show you how the investigation adversely affected the lives of a reporter (played by Robert Downey Jr), a homicide inspector (played by Mark Ruffalo), and a cartoonist (played by Jake Gyllenhaal)  hence the poster's tag line ""There's more than one way to lose your life to a killer.""The strategy of the movie is this: To show how frustrating and tiresome a murder investigation can be, the movie wants to put you through a frustrating and tiresome experience. To make us feel the way the characters spent long wasted hours sifting through the minutiae of the case in the vain effort to arrest a suspect, the movie puts you through a long 160 minutes of minutiae for you to sift through. The movie worked on me as intended  I was maddeningly frustrated and extremely tired. This is great story-telling? Nope, I'm not buying that pretentious load of baggage.How did the Zodiac affect the main characters? I wouldn't know. The movie never tries to understand them emotionally or psychologically. The script doesn't give them much to do except sift minutiae and the acting can't seem to rise above the ponderous bleakness stretched across the whole production.Zodiac is a waste of your time. Wait and see it on late night cable when you need to catch up on some sleep.",Zodiac
814,wdrmmrdw,Most Over-Rated Movie of 2007,1,20 March 2007,"I was about to write my own review of Zodiac when I thought I'd check out the last few IMDb reviews. People seem to either love it or hate it. Judging by the near empty theater I saw it in yesterday I'd say the latter seems to be the dominant opinion. If you do want to see it on a big screen you better see it soon -- the movie isn't doing very well at the box office.After reading a few of the past IMDb reviews which rated Zodiac a ""10"" I have to wonder, did I see the same movie? (Note: all the quotes are from a previous IMDb review):""Masterpiece""? --- No way. ""Tense""? --- Nope. ""Mystery Suspense""? --- I wish. ""Mind-bendingly absorbing""? --- Try mind-bendingly dull.""Creepily Disturbing""? --- Yes, because I was wasting 3 hours of my life on this. ""Riveting drama""? --- About as much as paint drying. ""So dense I had to watch it two times""? --- Try running full force into a brick wall, it'll at least be cheaper and take much less than 160 minutes. ""Top notch production values which obviously cost high sums of money"" --- I bet the studio that made it wishes they could get their money back. ""Best movie of 2007"" --- try most over-rated movie of 2007.Okay, so we have a difference of opinion here. However, what I really dislike about some of these ""10"" rated reviews is the way they defend their positions with lines like ""Zodiac is tragically under-appreciated as a commercial flop due to the majority of the audience's disdain out of a short-attention-span impatience, dissatisfaction and ignorance."" First of all, I do not under-appreciate it as a commercial flop at all. On the contrary. I very much appreciate it as a commercial flop  because this movie stunk and deserves to be a commercial flop  but I don't think that's what the reviewer was really trying to say. What he was trying to say was that because I was exceedingly bored by the movie that I have a short attention span and that I am ignorant --- and that I shouldn't trust my own dissatisfaction. I guess when you have such a superiority complex you have to explain away why this ""dense"" ""masterpiece"" is playing in a theater that's ""nearly empty"" save for (and I'm paraphrasing a previous review) a few senior citizens who you somehow were able to ascertain ""liked the film."" Maybe they were so happy about the experience because they only paid senior citizen bargain prices while you had to pay full freight.Okay, so I've had my rant because I don't like being told that I'm ignorant just because I thought this movie was atrocious.Why do I think it was atrocious? Story: Convoluted. Emotionally uninvolving. Editing: Terrible. The movie's an hour too long.Acting: Wooden. Jake Gyllenhaal is particularly flat. Cinematography: Strangely subdued with a few standout shots that are disconnected to the story. I'm not sure that the look was all that appropriate for the period. It probably would have looked better had it been shot on film rather than digitally. Production Design: Excellent at recreating the period. But when that's all that's watchable about the movie, something is definitely going wrong.Will this movie stand ""the test of time"" as ""viewer appreciation grows"" for the misunderstood ""Zodiac"" (as a previous reviewer has predicted). I think not. My prediction: the movie will not even be screening in theaters in a few weeks. Not soon enough if you ask me.",Zodiac
815,bosoxfan851,Zodiac,8,26 March 2007,"I thought that Zodiac was a really well done movie. Even though it was a tad long it kept my interest throughout the movie and was well written. I only knew a little bit about the movie going into it so it kept me guessing throughout the movie. I thought Downing Jr. did a great job in his role. The story of a serial killer using zodiac symbols and puzzles was new to me in the movie world. I had never seen it before and i liked movies such as Seven. Mysterious suspense movies that kept you thinking and on your toes. I think Gyllenhall did a great job also in the movie. His character started off as a shy comic drawing nobody into a crazy, obsessed driven man that almost lost everything in his attempts to find the Zodiac killer. I liked that it wasn't one of those flashy horror movies that come out that have no plot. This was a movie that had a plot, was well acted, had great dialog and mysterious twists.",Zodiac

I originally thought that this movie was going to be overtly scary and would shock me quite a bit and in some cases it did but it was so well written, directed and acted I could not concentrate on the scarier aspects.

817,deano-wills,Oscar will ignore this...but they ignored Hitchcok too!,9,25 August 2007,"Note to tman90 - Fincher's work has always been edited to perfection and all of his films look the same, from his early music videos to Zodiac, Ficher's work has always told truths of a consummate story teller. If earlier was a little rough around the edges, then this film alone only goes to show that practice makes perfect. And it is here that we agree. As far as two and a half hour films are concerned I would usually wonder if, maybe, the director was given a little bit too much freedom, but with Zodiac I just couldn't stop myself from becoming an amateur sleuth and getting involved with the case, and as tman90 says, you have to stay to the end to find out who was right. This is a film that invites the viewer to take part in the mystery. Sustained shots of evidence, such as letters from the killer and encoded clues are put in front of us to encourage audience participation. Cross editing between all those investigating the murders allow us all to join in the discussion. At no point i the film is he audience privy to any evidence involving the case which is not already known by the characters in the film. It's a real closed narrative that allows speculation to arise from all those involved, the characters and the audience. To all... Watch and enjoy.",Zodiac

Nearly two-and-a-half hours of Jake Gyllehal walking around wondering who the Zodiac killer is. Most of the acting is o.k, but they over act a few times. And the worst part was the screenplay. I had the the feeling that five different writers who never met wrote a few pages, e-mailed them to each other and stapled them together. It was as if they didn't think it was necessary to even edit it! I was bored throughout the entire film, and my mum and my sister felt the same way.

There is an obvious parallel to the New York City serial killings portrayed in Summer of Sam.Did anyone out there think that it was a bit odd that Jake Gyllenhaal's wardrobe included cowboy style shirts (the light blue plaid one in particular in his opening scene) and in another scene a winter jacket -- both VERY reminiscent of his Brokeback Mountain role as Jack Twist -- which I found a bit distracting.",Zodiac

Running time was way too long. It felt like we were watching a bad late night cable movie. This movie stank.Was it supposed to be a suspense film? If so, it wasn't very suspenseful.

821,stefanc-limbrunner,ZODIAC by David Fincher - a strong study of a killer hunt.,8,9 June 2007,"David Finchers new film is not only completely different from his other movies. like ""Fight Club"", ""Alien 3"" or ""Se7en"", it is also completely opposite to what moviegoers would expect. It is not a serial killer movie. It is a dark, atmospheric and very suspenseful study of those four characters - San Francisco Chronicle Reporter Paul Avery,his colleague the cartoonist Robert Graysmith on whose book the film is based), San Francisco Detective David Toschi and his colleague Bill Armstrong - who are, and in part, keep searching for the scary serial murderer ,who kalled himself the ""Zodiac"",for 22 years; and it is also a study of the scars that their search is leaving on their minds and souls. The film is so precisely authentic as Richard Fleischers 1968 classic ""The Boston Strangler"" with Tony Curtis, and it is a powerful dialogue film almost as strong as Alan J. Pakulas ""All The President's Men"" from 1976. Yet, there are some weaknesses in Finchers excellent film, and most of them rely on the screenplay by James Vanderbilt. The Film gives away to many filmic opportunities (for example: The Zodiacs threat to attack a schulbus is only referred to in a little scene, when Robert Graysmith does not allow his son to take the bus, because of fear. Why is there not a sequence showing how police officers had to guide the buses in the bay area for months? Or: When one of the victims is taking a nightly carride with the killer, without knowing, the film cuts very early, though this ride in reality took hours. Why not exploring that fearful situation? Why not using that - authentic - material? Strong filmic possibility - not used well enough)and those opportunities would have helped to give the viewer a deeper impression of the fright of the people - and finally, that fright is the motor of the investigation that the film is about. A second problem, although not a very big one, but still nerving, is the permanent giving of dates. You sew terms like ""2 weeks later"" so often displayed on the screen, that you sometimes tend to loose the knowledge of where on the time table you are. It would have been better to stick to that device only for the most important sequences of the case - instead of using them always. The third and last weakness of Finchers movie , is that the screenplay as well as Finchers direction never gives us the possibility to go deep enough into the pain, despair and frustration of the ""searchers"" - their feelings are explored, and those characters are portrayed very well, but since the film concentrates on their feelings as a main topic, those feelings stay a little bit too much on the surface to carry the whole movie. But the structure and very fine acting does instead. Robert Downey jr's performance is exquisite, especially his timing and presence, but also the slow , almost invisible sliding of his character into drug and alcohol abuse. Excellent too is Jake Gyllenhaal in portrayng Robert Graysmith, whose well meant idea to help find the killer develops more and more in a blind and destructive obesession he sacrifices everything for. Mark Ruffalo can convince as David Toschi, especially pointing out his frustration in the second half of the .The entire supporting cast is quite good in addition. But despite of those three weaknesses , mentioned before, it is still a strong, highly entertaining and almost hypnotizing retelling of a legendary investagition in a brave, and well fitting, semi - documentary - style, a film whose authenticity is maybe more chilling than the most thrillers are, a film that never feels nearly as long as its running time actually is. One of the most interesting films this year.",Zodiac

Although ""Zodiac"" is filmed in a more classical way, it has the modern touches that made Fincher famous in his previous films. Even its running time is more than 150 minutes doesn't result heavy.

If you go into it expecting suspense, mass-murder, gore, etc. Beware. There's nothing like that, in this movie. It's basically a 3 hour documentary about Jake Gyllenhaal's obsession with the Zodiac killer.The only actual murders that take place within the movie, take place within the first 30 or so minutes of it.That set aside, if the movie was trying to appeal to the more ""mature"" audience (18+), and try to be interesting without all the gore, violence, cursing, suspense, and action, then the movie was probably successful on a few levels. The character development of Jake Gyllenhaal was very apparent, but not even his (decent to good) acting in this movie, can keep you awake, if you're expecting an interesting movie.The only way to be interested in this film, is if you like movies that feed you the same redundant information, over and over, for 3 hours straight. And even then, still nothing goes anywhere. And nothing gets resolved in the end.I gave this 2 stars. Simply because there WAS character development.

826,ronkctke-1,My Thoughts....,4,9 September 2007,"The movie was good but too long and drawn out. Two-and-a-half hours seems like 4 in the drawn out portions of the plot that need not be shown. Several portions of the movie really did not need to be emphasized as much as they were. They were better off left on the cutting room floor and burned to a crisp. I am so glad I waited until it came out on OnDemand to watch it and only wasted $3.99 of my hard earned money to see it, instead of the $60 bucks it would have cost me to see it at a movie theater. By the time you pay for tickets, popcorn, drinks and everything else it would have been a waste of money to see it in a theater. Now, I will know not to waste more of my money to buy the DVD and Not to ad it to my collection of DVD movies.",Zodiac
827,clownface-1,He said he's not the Zodiac?,4,7 October 2007,"I saw this film about three months ago and I kind of enjoyed it or should I say didn't find anything particular wrong in it. Two months later though, something reminded me about this film and I did a recap in my mind about it. Then i realized that this film is totally screwed up.For starters, Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal), who is supposedly the main character, ""vanishes"" for almost an HOUR screen time!? And then he comes back as if he was never gone and continues to be the main character. And I wish that was the one and only idiotic detail in this movie.The most fundamental error the writers made in this picture has most definitely got to be the exposure of the Zodiac in, I think, the first hour of screen time (it's a two and half hour film). So Arthur Leigh Allen is being questioned on the count of his fishing mate telling the police that Arthur wanted to become a serial killer by the name of Zodiac (ain't that something)... he is acting very suspicious...then he drops the most idiotic line in movie history (even dumber than ""It's not what you think""):""I am not the Zodiac. And if I were, I certainly wouldn't tell you"". And as if that wasn't enough proof that he's the Zodiac, aside from being retarded, the inspector noticed Arthur rubbing his watch and asked if he could take a look at it. This request startled Arthur but he gave his watch to the Inspector and what do you know... the watch's name brand is Zodiac. If by now it's not crystal clear to you that Arthur Leigh Allen is the Zodiac killer then you must have slept through the first half of the movie.So please tell me that I'm not the only one who finds this movie out of order. Although I laughed my ass off after i realized this. ""I'm not the Zodiac"" he said!?",Zodiac

And i also found that his hand writing didn't match that of the Zodiac but on his file it says don't dismiss because of hand writing.I found out that they had set up a case against him but then suddenly he DIED of a heart attack 2 days before the case a bit strange.Since then there has been no mention or sign of the Zodiac, just in my opinion i thought it would have had to be him.",Zodiac

It's full of great acting, suspense, and very good characters. I feel it should win the Oscar for best direction. It was purely fantastic. I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to be blown away by one of the best movies of 2007. The scenes are well directed, played and the script is unbelievable. Trust me, you will love this movie.

The movie is based in the early 60's which gave you more of the feel when it actually happened this movie was very well done and the acting was good i would watch it again but like i said not anytime soon.i would like to see Jake Gyllenhall and Robert downy JR do another movie like this together,Zodiac
831,mymurphy-1,Fincher's Return to Form.,9,20 June 2008,"Zodiac is one of the most detailed and absorbing crime dramas released this decade, and marks a major return to heavyweight film making for it's director after the inconsequential Panic Room. Never before have the minute details of solving a murder case been so thoroughly and thrillingly explored, the film making a detective of it's audience, who are left striving to solve the real life case of the Zodiac Killer with the puzzle pieces the film provides. On a purely technical level, the film is a masterpiece of art direction, cinematography, acting and writing, with Fincher proving himself to be a master of his craft. An interesting companion to his earlier Se7en, Zodiac lacks some of the visceral intensity of that picture, but makes up for this in its elegance and expert handling of immensely complex streams of information.Intriguing, chilling and highly recommended.",Zodiac
832,zieglerdr,Lacks Focus,6,16 August 2008,"Fincher has certainly directed some classics such as Seven and Fight Club, so I came into this movie with high expectations. However he did do some things right. First off, the cast is fantastic, specifically Robert Downey Jr. Also, the movie transitioned well, considering how often it jumped time.But somewhere during the process of making this movie, Fincher got too ambitious. The movie is too long, there is too much focus on too many characters and too much varying information given. At some point, it changed left the realm of entertainment and became a video textbook on the Zodiac killings. In the end, the movie had its moments; they were just too far spread apart.",Zodiac

I enjoyed the fact that the director made sure to keep focus on the case itself instead of bringing in Vietnam and other events of the times. One thing that really frustrated me was that they would use cars that (according to the timeline) didn't come out until ten years later! Very frustrating if your a American Muscle or Hot Rod fan...I'm only a high school student, but even I know that the blood on the cabbie's shirt would've turned brown after being on the fabric for so long. COME ON GUYS, you've got to give the intelligence of people some credit now. sheesh!Anyway, it was a good movie the first time, not one I would recommend watching a second time.

834,TheVariable,Another masterpiece from Fincher,10,28 December 2009,"Zodiac is an intriguing film, based on a true story about a notorious serial killer in California during the 1960s and 1970s, who fashioned for himself the name ""Zodiac"". The film truly gives us a realistic view into how the serial killer terrorized the San Francisco bay area and how people reacted. The film mostly revolves around the political cartoonist Robert Graysmith, solving the mystery of Zodiac's identity becomes an obsession for him.The acting in Zodiac is impeccable, it's packed with great actors. Gyllenhaal truly manages to capture the soul of Robert Graysmith, and I would say that this is one of his best performances, while Robert Downey Jr and Mark Ruffalo are also at their best.The script is so well written that you would think you are seeing real life footage from back then. Moreover, Fincher as always, creates the perfect atmosphere, from lighting to music. For instance, the soundtrack really gives that 1960s/1970s feel to it. Fincher's directing style is apparent throughout the film, and like each of his films this is also unique.Zodiac might be about a psychotic serial killer, but don't expect to see a very violent and scary horror film. There are a few scene that might send chills down your spine, but overall it's nothing like Se7en. Fincher could easily have made a gory film with the killer as the protagonist, but instead he made a complex and ambitious movie, with obsession as the ""protagonist"". The bottom line is that ""Zodiac"" is an amazing film that is not only entertaining, but is also a reminder of how each one of us can get carried away with a mystery. This is definitely a mystery film that you can get carried away with.",Zodiac

I tend to stick to documentaries or TV series when it comes to my true crime consumption, but Zodiac held tightly to the real facts of the case while also providing a paradigm shift allowing viewers to experience the perspective of investigators and reporters, telling a more personal story. True crime outlets usually focus solely on the lives and perspectives of only the victim and the perpetrator, when in reality any violent crime affects a great number of people, even loosely involved. This was a refreshing way to explore an incredibly well known case, and was entertaining and intriguing despite feeling quite slow and drawn out at times. Overall, a fine use of ~2.5 hours, and I'd give it an 8/10.",Zodiac
837,miami-derek,Fincher's finest work,10,23 August 2011,"In David Fincher's ""Zodiac"", the only scenes usually connected with a serial killer film happen early-and make no mistake, they're bracing. If I had known ahead of time that the only parts showing the killer at work were few and far between, I would've wondered what made up the rest of the nearly 3 hour film. Knowing the bland Jake Gyllenhall was the star certainly wouldn't have been a plus...but for this great movie, forget all previous misconceptions. Not only is this the best film of the genre ever made, it's also director David Fincher's finest work. Take the best parts of ""7"", ""The Game"", and ""The Panic Room""; mix 'em up into a creation worthy of Hitchcock; and you have ""Zodiac"", the most criminally underrated film from the last decade.",Zodiac
838,RTH20Voomp,Too much cute humor and a lackluster story,6,16 March 2007,"Zodiac, the story of the famous Zodiac killer, is perhaps Fincher's weakest film yet. Despite a great opening scene set to Three Dog Nights ""Easy to be Hard"", the film works toward an anti-climatic ending. The computer effects are overdone, used mostly to lapse the long periods of time that take place between the activity of the Zodiac killer. At a point in the film, our focus turns to the quest of a cartoonist who becomes obsessed with finding out who the Zodiac is. We're often left questioning if he himself is the Zodiac. Unfortunately, the story is all over the place, switching between the many character's ongoing and interconnected quests to solve the puzzle of the Zodiac's identity. The fear of the Zodiac was that he could have been anybody, and this selling point was hardly addressed. There are plenty of plot holes, unexplained character reactions, and unexplained events as well. And of course, the computer graphics were mostly unnecessary. Fincher's style is only present in a few well done scenes, leaving most of the photography as boring and repetitive series of medium and close shots. This basically mirrors the story, repetitive and a bit boring. However, the opening sequence is one to remember, and the film deserves merit for being a notch above most Hollywood films... dare I say than ""The Departed""? All in all, I'll give it a 6 out of 10. Not good enough to buy, but not bad enough to write off David Fincher as one of the last hopes for the industry.",Zodiac
839,mike-1674,"Too Long, No Suspense",2,1 March 2007,"Right up until the release of Panic Room, David Fincher could do no wrong. It's truly all over now.I went to a radio station screening of the movie yesterday, and I was utterly disappointed. Most people know the story of the Zodiac, so a lot of the suspense would be gone. But a good movie about a serial killer needs suspense. The movie starts off brilliantly, focusing on writer Paul Avery's downward decent of obsession with the story and the revelation of the identity of the killer. Robert Downey Jr's portrayal is stunning, and he builds much empathy for the character. The story moves along at a brisk pace, and it keeps you entertained.Then when you think the movie is over, it just keeps going. It tells the story of the decent of Robert Graysmith, retreading a similar storyline for another hour plus. Jake Gyllenhaal does a decent job, but the audience quickly loses interest. The movie keeps track of time by announcing the time lapse between scenes (2 months later, for example) and as the movie passes the two hour mark you could hear the audience groan every time a new announcement of time was displayed.Why is this a bad movie? The photography, set dressing, and costuming was top notch. The cast was brilliant. Even the story is compelling, but the editing by Kirk Baxter and Angus Wall seems to be missing. I think Fincher used every frame he shot in the final cut, and that does this movie a terrible disservice. When telling a story you have to read your audience, and make sure they stayed engaged. This movie loses you at 1:50. I hardly ever tell people to stay away from a movie, but I'm telling you to stay away from Zodiac. It will leave you with a bad taste in your mouth.",Zodiac
840,chicken_wuss75,A Big Disappointment,2,4 March 2007,"The Zodiac Killer was a troubling, exhilarating case that was never solved, and the one suspect most sought after died before he could confess. This information, the entirety of the case contains such a build that one would expect an equally breath-taking film.This however is not the case. The film lacked the suspense of the true case of the Zodiac. The facts presented during the film were simply restated over and over, and progress did not seem to be made until the very end of the film, and even then it was anticlimactic.All of the information about the Zodiac Killer could have come from Wikipedia, and it would have taken one fifth of the time to learn rather than watching the film.The acting was even lackluster. It had no emotion in it, and it was poorly delivered.I would suggest not wasting time on seeing the movie and simply popping open a book or just reading an encyclopedia.",Zodiac
841,faizkhwaja,"Slightly disappointed, but only because of Fincher's other films",7,22 July 2020,"Let me start off by saying that I didn't watch this film when it first came out. I watched it recently, only after seeing other Fincher (a top 3 director in my opinion) films such as Gone Girl, Se7en, The Social Network, and Fight Club. It is safe to say that after seeing this movies and seeing a star studded cast that included one of my favourite actors Jake Gyllenhaal, I had high hopes for this movie.This movie is not a bad movie by any regard. However, I believe there are a number of things holding it back. The acting is certainly up to the standard I was expecting; however, given that they are telling the story of a true officially unsolved case, I do not think they did it full justice. There were a number of intriguing scenes that left me wondering what would happen next (especially at the start with the introduction of the Zodiac Killer), only for the intimacy of the moment to be broken by a ""3 years later"". 3 years later? Really? This may be me being extra critical of the movie failing to capture my attention and wanting to know what would happen next. After a certain number of time breaks, I lost interest in the Zodiac, like every character in the film except for Mark Ruffalo and Jake Gyllenhaal.Overall, this film was enjoyable but I would not see myself returning to it when there are so many better movies about similar subjects out there.",Zodiac
842,jcovinojr-632-645673,"Fantastic Film, Flimsy Premise!",1,12 January 2020,"Reviewers unthinkingly praising this flick seriously need to develop the simplest of critical thinking skills, people!
Arthur Leigh Allen was a primed, not prime suspect, totally eliminated by all rational and scientific standards of evidence.
If we're to believe this flick's lame conclusion, victim Mike Mageau identifies Allen as the Zodiac killer 22 years after the fact from a grainy driver's license photo after having seen the shooter only in the dark of night, reputedly with a blinding flashlight's glare in his face. Even the actor in the scene was wincing.
Fast forward to the San Joaquin jail, where the intrepid faux-investigator, Graysmith, presses Darlene Ferrin's incarcerated sister, Linda del Buono, to finally blurt out the name of the mysterious stranger-in-a-suit from their so-called, ""painting party,"" as LEE! Somebody del Buono would've seen as a direct eye-witness, up close and personal, in the light of day, and not whilst being shot by a gun multiple times in the dead of night.
Funny, nobody's thought to RUSH back to del Buono to confront HER with a clear photograph of Arthur Leigh Allen to either confirm or deny his identity and presence at that party!
In that single, solitary scene alone, the flick's whole silly and phony premise collapses into the mountainous heap of all the other fact-bending circumstantial non-evidence falsely peddled as the truth for profiteering purposes.

Some say ""wow, that's acting"". Go and look at yourself in the mirror, and im sure you can act a pathetic character like that just as good.

844,savingprivateryanquotes,Underrated masterpiece,10,15 July 2015,"Where to start? Probably with my bad English ;)I'm a big fan of movies that re-create the 1920s till 1970s. This is how I found about Zodiac. I had only seen the trailer, nothing more, I knew nothing about it.This was the first movie that had me gripped every single second. The opening began already with 1960s music, which gave me immediately the 1960s feelings. That is also one of the reasons this movie is fantastic, everything you see is literally from the 1960s-1970s. The cars, clothing, whole interiors, little details you probably wouldn't even notice.After the opening scene where something importants happened, I couldn't take me eyes of the screen. I needed to know how it would end. Like one of the main characters said: ""I need to know who he is. I  I need to stand there, I need to look him in the eye, and I need to know that it's him."", I had the same.This is also David Finchers best work, in my opinion. I'm a big fan of Fight Club but this is so much better if it comes to directing. The movie is beautifully shot.Well, I could talk like this much longer but I won't. If you haven't seen it yet, SEE IT! For myself, I have seen it now for almost like 50 times, and it became my favorite movie of all time.",Zodiac

847,Cocky_USC,Zodiac,8,2 March 2007,"I think it would be helpful before viewing this movie to have read Mr. Graysmith's two books chronicling the attempted detection of an allusive almost, at times, invisible sadistic serial killer. Mr. Fincher's intention is to purposely and deliberatley inundate you with facts, figures, and theories to tease the brain and give the audience the exact schizophrenic fact-finding frame of mind the real-life detectives had while tracking the thousands of suspects, the myriad of letters and copycat letters, basically, a forest of information that left them completely confused and bewildered as to detecting the real identity of Zodiac. In Mr. Graysmith's book, he basically leads the reader to believe that all the evidenece combined pinpoints to Arthur Leigh Allen, most of the evidence is circumstantial, but certainly compelling. And if Zodiac didn't kill in obscure jurisdictional boundaries throughout California, maybe the evidence would have been even more certain. I'm suspecting that this move is going to focus and highlight a lot of the mass confusion, paranoia, and anxiety during Zodiac multi-decade reign of terror. What we also have to realize is that this movie is based on real events. This is not a elaborate visual stunning fiction, like Fight Club, Panic Room, The Game, and Se7en, so there is definitely going to be more emphasis on complicated plot lines to capture the effect of the multiple perspectives that plagued the Zodiac hunt. I'll expect multiple plots, sub-plots, and thematic/character complications, not in a bad way, that dazzle the mind and force you to think about this movie as a detective searching for a serial killer might. I expect to become absolutely hypnotized by the plot, and the usual dank dark visuals from Mr. Fincher. Can't wait to see it, going tonight.",Zodiac
848,darrius-marcus-edwards,Outlook on the Zodiac,8,19 November 2013,"The basis of this film was more concentrated on the fascination of caputuring the suspect rather than focusing on the psychologicial make and drive of the suspect. I thought the director was effective indentifying who he had believed to be the suspect because in other movies there are different beliefs of who the culprit is. The view of the case in this movie is unique because rather than looking at it coming from a petrified citizen or the killer himself standpoint, it comes as you from a group of devoted and somewhat obsessed group of people who desperately want to catch the Zodiac. This view gives a different kind of perspective that allows a different outlook on what might have been the frame of mind that others had on this case.",Zodiac

857,cyrusthevirus46,Rather late review of the film 'Zodiac' (2007),10,5 January 2015,"Fans of David Finchers work will not be displeased by this somewhat hidden little gem. It is a flawlessly casted and masterfully crafted film with tension and twists around every corner. You will find yourself on the edge of your seat for almost the entirety of this gritty and dark mystery drama that follows the zodiac killer murders and the investigations that followed throughout the late 60's and 70's. The movie primarily focuses on three separate main characters, played by Robert Downey Jr, Jake Gyllenhal and Mark Ruffalo who are all in a constant battle against the notorious 'Zodiac killer' who is outplaying them at every turn. I won't give anymore away in terms of plot. I must praise the director for his ability to make my pulse race and I can honestly say this did occur at least 3 times during this movie and I'm pretty sure if you watch it you will understand what I am talking about. I would not recommend this film to anyone under the age of 18 however because of the violence (although a rare commodity in this flick, when it does happen it is brutal.) Finally I must say that what really stood out to me about this film was that David Fincher substitutes his rather trademarked style of gory and in your face violence (as seen in se7en) for a more dialogue driven and stylised murder mystery film. I sincerely hope anyone who reads this takes my advice and goes to see this film and I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.",Zodiac

863,Paulina1492,Captivating for all three hours!,10,6 March 2007,"Although I totally forgot Se7en and didn't see Panic Room, I can say that Mr. Fincher is now one of my favourites. Fight Club this is not, but it's a delicate drama meticulously and attentively directed. This is a movie's movie, and does not seem long at all, only not long enough! I thought casting Mark Ruffalo was weird, but he is astounding in his role. Jake Gyllenhaal, besides being beautiful and intelligent and sexy, delivers an absolutely brilliant performance. Can't wait to see the 6-hour director's cut and commentary and (more Jake Gyllenhaal) and anything else relating to this gripping masterpiece. Thanks for reading! Paulina",Zodiac

865,nawar_noori,Perfect,10,12 July 2007,"Actually, just what I'd expected. Not something overtly gruesome and disturbing, but something that might really look like a real police investigation. The script is very, very solid and the whole plot didn't let me go until the end. Also, the fact that it's based on real facts makes it much more creepier. The whole ambiguity of the killer, the ciphers, the numerous murders that may or may not have been committed by him, the perfect camera work of the director and the acting of Gyllenhaal, Downey and Ruffalo provide for a really intense experience and I'm just sorry for all those people who had particular expectations about this movie that were not met. 10 out of 10.",Zodiac
866,jsehnert-67473,A Little Too Realistic,7,3 October 2018,"I just finished watching Zodiac for the first time. As a fan of Fincher's other mystery films and the cast, I was thoroughly excited to watch it. Without saying too much, I was very entertained by the film up until the very inconclusive ending. I was a little let down, but can empathize with Fincher, as this film is one of the few that are actually factual and based on true stories without embellishment. The ending for me bumped it down from an 8/9 to a 7.",Zodiac
867,zolotayaptichka,What did I just watch?,2,4 March 2019,"I had to recover my IMDb account through one of my phony emails just to say this - what the hell was that? I've been so bored, nothing was happening in this movie after 1968. 10 years later and still nothing happening. I jokingly said to my hisband the next scene should be in the 90s and nothing would still happen. And there it was! 1991 and nothing! Suspects, leads, something something, stuff happening for no reason, why Downy jr. was even in this movie? Wife, children? 90% of what was in this movie could be just cut out and it wouldn't make a difference. At the end I wanted to kill myself. How can I get 3 hours of my life back please?",Zodiac

869,olegdur,Zodiac,10,18 April 2017,"The still-unidentified Zodiac — a serial murderer who made Northern California his own private ant farm throughout 1968-69 — had but five confirmed kills. David Fincher's ""Zodiac"" drilled into dark pathology's of each man's process — anxiety, compulsion, uncertainty, miscommunication, territorialism — and directed Jake Gyllenhaal (Graysmith), Robert Downey Jr. (Avery) and Mark Ruffalo (Toschi) to stupendous specificities. ""Zodiac"" is not without wry humor or unexpected character details. But the onus of obsession is Fincher's foremost goal — desperation for definitive answers that obscures danger. ""Zodiac"" rides in a paranoia rumbleseat all along, but floors it over potholes during a spine-tingling climactic basement scene — evocative of how discovery and understanding come to supersede sanity, safety, justice or reason. So insistent, and successful, is Fincher at duplicating that hypervigilance that, by film's end, you may try writing a ""k"" in two, not three, strokes to see the difference — damning and admiring how Fincher's indisputable masterpiece has dragged you down that rabbit hole.",Zodiac
870,Wayne-1992,Short review,10,5 July 2017,"Zodiac is an intelligent and thoughtful film, which imposes the rigor with which its shots are built. The music, the history, the crimes, the camera movements are amazing.The actors are crazy, Fincher's perfectionism is bluffing, some may criticize its duration, but the boredom is absent. Based on a true story, which is ""shocking"", the movie took me away.",Zodiac
871,pirce,Skilled directing but maybe too realistic,6,19 June 2007,"Im a big fan of Finchers work, I've seen most of his work. And Zodiac is no doubt a sample of very skilled directing. But I found the subject and the presentation too protracted in a sense. The directing was maybe TOO realistic, I couldn't keep track of the constant flow of names and new characters and places. In the end I could only remember the main three characters names. And all the investigation and conversation was depicted very credibly but then again not very interestingly. But maybe its just me. The movie did have great performances, especially by Mark Ruffalo and Robert Downy Jr. But these weren't nearly enough to save the film from its grinding pace. In the beginning and in the end there were truly great and exciting scenes, particularly the murder scenes. But the middle 2 hours were just too tiresome for me. IMO not Finchers best work and doesn't deserve to be in the top 250.",Zodiac
872,Lindsayrand,Can you break the secret code?? cause i cant,8,5 March 2007,"It was good and very suspenseful from the beginning. It also kept my ass on the edge of my seat. The storyline made you think and there were many twists and turns. The cinematography was done extremely well, along with the costumes. I also loved all of the actors, especially Robert Downey Jr. He was amazingly funny and fresh. Jake did a good job as well, but they did not do such a great job on giving him a proper make-up/aging process. There were many good actors in this movie and I highly recommend it.*my only issue with Zodiac is its lenght. . .3 hours was a lil to long. I would of never ever walked out,but i would stack up on refreshments : )",Zodiac
873,ataauri-66023,"Disgusting, took me 6 minutes to turn it off",1,17 June 2021,"This movie is terribly tone-deaf and disrespectful to the subject matter. I saw 2 scenes of the film and was disgusted with both of them. At this point I decided there is no point to watching this movie any further.At the beginning of the movie, we can see reenactment of a murder of a young couple set to an upbeat, happy music. The real event, real human tragedy set to a happy tune! This is not fiction, it's not like the actors are pretending they are some fictional teenagers being shot by some made up fictional killer. We are supposed to see it (although the director perhaps has a different opinion on this matter) as something that really happen. You can find names of the people being shot on the screen. In real world, that day two families lost their daughter and their son. In the world of the movie, it's a quirky introduction to the killer. Absolutely. Disguising.From the way this movie was advertised on Netflix, I was expecting a documentary filmed in a style of an thriller. I expected to be terrified most of the time, because things Zodiac Killer did were terrifying. He specifically targeted young couples and what's worse, one part of the couple usually lived. I was in a very deep and loving relationship at that time and when I learned of this men, for months I could shake from myself the terror of being attacked by a mad man and loosing the love of my life, just because someone chose to take her away from me.Going back to the film, the real life events that sparked so much anxiety in my life made me feel less that deaths of many fictional characters. I felt that anxiety reading a Wikipedia article on the killer while fact-checking for this review and not while the events unfolded on the screen. The music should've stop with the first gunshot, since silence is the most terrifying piece of music on the sound track. But if this is so important, there are many ways to keep the music and still make the scene terrifying. Screams of terror, gurgling of a dying body, radio being accidentally shot and distorting the Rock&Roll music. None of this happens. Go watch the scene yourself, it's just the beginning of the movie. The only two sounds are gunshots and Rock&Roll. The moans of the actress, drowned out by the much louder music, would fit better in an adult film, not in a thriller in a scene, where her boyfriend is out of nowhere being shot dead multiple times right next to her in her car.But at this point I was just slightly disappointed. I still haven't formed my opinion on this movie and if the rest of it would be ok, the problem I had with the first scene would be nothing more than a minor annoyance.But it immediately gets worst!After a wide shot of the city we are greeted with COMEDY SKIT between main character and his son. Yes, in this movie about a terrifying killer, a movie after which you should be afraid to go to your car after exiting the cinema there is comedy. Immediately after the scene where real people tragically lost their lives, we are immediately supposed to laugh at the child swallowing toothpaste, because it taste like mint. AFTER TWO REAL PEOPLE DIE, SHOT BY A PSYCHO-KILLER, YOU, THE VIEWER, ARE SUPPOSED TO LAUGH AT A CHILD SWALLOWING TOOTHPASTE! WHO IN A GOD'S NAME IS THIS FOR?The only person I can see enjoying this movie is the Zodiac Killer himself, so he can rewatch his happy memories of hunting people. So watch out for 10/10 reviews, maybe you found your guy.This could be a good fictional movie. I wouldn't know because I will never watch it. But it's a movie about real life events and as such, I can tell you it's garbage just from how it starts. People in their reviews point out how long this movie is. It would take you longer to go on YouTube, search for ""Zodiac Killer"" and find a video that is as disrespectful to the real life events related to the killing as the first few minutes of this movie. Bravo Hollywood for being morally rotten as always.",Zodiac
874,guicho-luna,One of the best.,8,8 August 2018,"Zodiac may be David Fincher's most underrated piece of work, with critics saying that ""Fight club"" and ""Seven"" are his best films, I can see why, because they are some of the best films of the 90s. However, I think Zodiac stands out from the rest of his work. It is packed with suspenseful scenes, including the one where Jake Gyllenhaal's character enters a suspect's basement, and we are feeling the same way he is. Scared to death. Another scene is where the news call the zodiac killer of ""Sam"" as he calls himself. The call contains ""Sam"" screaming and saying that he has ""Headaches"" and that he kills to ""Stop the Headaches"" And that was actually true. Disturbing. This film is very similar to ""Seven"" Also one of his best films. It has the same idea that there is a serial killer is going around the city. And honestly, Seven overshadows it. Zodiac is around 3 hours long, and it had me pinned to my seat. And I love the look of this film, as David Fincher makes it actually look like It was made in the 60s. He even goes to the level that actors had to wear the same clothing. However, I overall love this film, if I had a wish it would be more appreciated.
The performances are great by Mark Ruffalo and Robert Downey JR.",Zodiac
875,dtbsz,talking about bad acting and wasting time,3,9 March 2007,"When I saw the rating of 8 I went looking for my jaw....I haven't c'n such horrible acting in a while. I'm not much of a movie critic but taking a story that is already out there and making a movie using specific techniques' doesn't make the writer/director a somebody. It shouts.... It's a WANNABE.Unorigial.... everybody can learn to draw but to be an artist you got to be born an artist.If you ask me there's no plot.... it's like in the game industry when a good game comes out shortly after a ton of trash, wannabe, unoriginal sh!t follows. Waste of time.The only thing that was good about it was the suspense and that at the end you are left wit ha big question-mark, but none of these two things are the writers merit.Probably reading wiki' on zodiac (the real story) would have been more interesting.",Zodiac
876,neil-anderson1,"Best film I have seen this year,only spoilt by some difficult to ....",9,13 July 2007,"Best film I have seen this year,only spoilt by some difficult to understand dialect,I had to re-wind my DVD several times to listen to some conversations and still could not understand what they were saying.Has anyone else had this problem with some American films or has my hearing deserted me? Some of 'The Departed' was difficult to understand.It seems to be the films or actors are trying to be cool and hip by talking very fast with a heavy accent.I have read on these posts that some people are struggling to understand the dialects of English films I wonder if these people have the same problem with this film? Robert Downey Jr. seemed to be the most difficult to understand.If it wasn't for this I would have given the film a 10/10.",Zodiac
877,iainskinner1985,Not for the ADD generation.,8,13 March 2007,"Warning: This film is flawed.That said, I thoroughly enjoyed Zodiac. Robert Downey Jr. was the stand-out of the cast, but other than Gyllenhall (who should have just quit after 'Donnie Darko') the cast as a whole was fine.As has been said, 'Seven' is better, but we've all seen that flick about 400 times, right? Fincher was on point and his refusal to pick one character as the lead is a Fincher trade-mark (see: Seven, Fight Club).Fincher succeeds in holding the (mature) audiences attention and manipulating our emotions whether through our frustration as suspects (whom we are convinced are the Zodiac) slip through our fingers, or through our fear as the killer(s) closes in on his prey.Some will argue that this movie was 'too long', but this complaint will mainly come from the 'ADD generation' raised on music videos.The soundtrack was great and very moody. Donovan's 'Hurdy-Gurdy Man' being the creepy stand-out.All-in-all this movie delivers and is the best thing in theatres right now. If you get bored easily, just go watch '300' instead.",Zodiac
