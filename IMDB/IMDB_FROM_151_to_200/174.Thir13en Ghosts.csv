0,TheLittleSongbird,"Great effects, make-up and house and Abraham and Elizabeth are decent, bad everything else",3,6 September 2012,"I haven't seem William Castle's Thir13en Ghosts in a while, though I do remember not being sure what to make of it. After seeing The Tingler(with Vincent Price) I now have a pretty good idea what to expect so will re-watch the film with those expectations in mind. I didn't care at all for this remake, which is proof that a remake can be bad on its own merits without being compared. It is not as if I dislike Dark Castle movies, I did enjoy Ghost Ship and House on Haunted Hill, though both had major imperfections. This said, Thir13en Ghosts is not a completely terrible movie. It does look great, the make-up is pretty incredible, the house is a wonderful setting and the effects are well above-average. F Murray Abraham has a great presence as the villain, although his role is not a patch on his outstanding performance in Amadeus. Shannon Elizabeth is not bad at all either though you do wish that she was in the film more. However, the rest of the acting is disappointing, mainly because the cast are very talented. I like Tony Shalhoub, but his character is annoying and he can do little to make him likable, while Embeth Davidtz struggles with a badly written role and Matthew Lillard overacts to the point that he is irritating. They are not helped though by their clichéd and poorly developed characters or by their embarrassingly cheesy dialogue. The story was a good idea but was unfortunately never lived up to. Everything feels too rushed, the ending is a thrown-in cop-out and the scares and jumps feel too brief and predictable. All in all, the visuals are great and there are two decent(not great though, Abraham especially has been much better) performances but the rest of the movie is bad. 3/10 Bethany Cox",Thir13en Ghosts
1,Leofwine_draca,The perfect cinematic ghost train ride,6,12 November 2016,"I went to see the THIR13EN GHOSTS remake expecting little. What I got was a paper-thin story, taking segments from GHOSTBUSTERS(!) and the HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL remake, plenty of clichéd situations and characters, some nifty special effects work, and a ton of jumps and scares. Added into the mixture was a smattering of gore and I actually found myself enjoying the whole thing. Sure, I'll have totally forgotten about this popcorn entertainment in a couple of days time but I can't deny that I had a good time watching it, despite the many flaws. One surprise is that I found it actually scary in a number of places especially where the ghosts are concerned. Some truly horrific special effects work from the reliable KNB group combined with a jolting soundtrack made this a horror film in the true sense of the word and one not for the squeamish.The biggest problem is first-time director Steve Beck, one of the new wave of film-makers who can't resist including plenty of MTV style into their movies. Thus we have lots of tricksy jump-cuts, slow motion, cameras sped up and all kinds of wannabe stylish bits in place of any real atmosphere - and no, Steve, panning your camera around a few empty corridors doesn't count as atmosphere building. The script is unbelievable but then so is the whole idea of the film, that a machine houses twelve ghosts who can open the ""Eye of Hell"". It's one of those movies where you have to turn off your brain to enjoy. Sure there are a couple of 'surprising' character twists here and there but by and large the film is an action-orientated horror romp which showcases scared people being chased and killed by a wide variety of evil spirits.Tony Shalhoub is the straight man in the film, the middle-aged male hero, a solid character who can't believe in what he sees. He's supported by Embeth Davidtz as some kind of idiotic 'ghost rights' campaigner and the effortlessly charismatic F. Murray Abraham as the cultured bad guy of the piece, another mad scientist type (Abraham fills the role of suave baddie perfectly). Former singer Rah Digga is unwelcome as the comedy relief housemaid (whose self-pitying presence recalls the 'spooked' black manservants of the horror-comedies of the 1940's) whilst Shannon Elizabeth is around to look pretty and not do a lot else. Finally, there's Matthew Lillard, giving us yet another shouty, psychotic, on-the-edge type performance which he has been doing all of his career. Now, where the rest of the cast fail to make likable characters, Lillard actually succeeds which is surprising seeing as I usually end up hating him in films. Sure he's overly neurotic and overacts his hat off but he supplies the film with limitless energy and I'm always a fan of old-fashioned ham, so good on you, mate.Obviously a roller-coaster ride through a spook house shocker such as this relies heavily on the effectiveness of the, well, effects and this is where THIR13EN GHOSTS succeeds admirably. From the not-bad CGI work used to animate the various parts of the house to the ghosts themselves, the effects are often deliciously good. The ghosts are all suitably grotesque and dead-looking, and thankfully are under-exposed so that they don't end up looking rubbery and fake. Seeing them briefly in quick snatches of vision makes their appearances a heck of a lot more frightening than prolonged exposure. However, the imaginative gore and death scenes are where the film really hits home and it's nice to see a movie which doesn't skimp on the good, old-fashioned grue. Bodies are broken in two, graphically squashed, torn, slashed, shredded to pieces. However the gruesome highlight is undoubtedly the effect where a man is sliced in half by a pane of glass (WISHMASTER tried a similarly elaborate type of effect but failed). Very nasty stuff indeed which comes as quite a shock.THIR13EN GHOSTS is a loud, vulgar, immature shocker which tops off the activity with an over-the-top finale involving lots of things breaking, exploding, the bad guys getting their comeuppances and the good guys getting saved by the skin of their teeth. In a word, clichéd, but somehow satisfying, like watching an old friend up on screen. Finally this is a blockbuster where the budget and effects count for everything and make the viewing experience worthwhile; so if you're looking for a shallow gore-splattered horror flick then look no further than this. Give it a break, critics and reviewers alike!",Thir13en Ghosts
2,SnoopyStyle,Love the design,6,18 October 2013,"Cyrus Kriticos (F. Murray Abraham) is a rich collector who has trapped an unfantomable evil. Only he lost his life doing it. His nephew Arthur (Tony Shalhoub) inherits his creation, a glass house that has imprisoned 12 ghosts. It's more than a house. It's a machine power by the dead to open the Eye of Hell.Arthur with his kids Kathy (Shannon Elizabeth) and Bobby, the babysitter and the attorney (JR Bourne) get trapped in the house. Dennis (Matthew Lillard) and Kalina (Embeth Davidtz) also sneak in, but they know what the house is truly for.I love the art and design of the house. It is beautiful and absolutely creepy in a new unique way. It's like you're trapped in a Rubik's cube. It makes every step you take a creepy dangerous one.The story itself is a pretty standard haunted house with a lot of bells and whistles. It has a short section to set it up but that wasn't really necessary. I really love the house.",Thir13en Ghosts
3,lee_eisenberg,"Where ""ghost"" thou?",5,11 June 2006,"""Thir13en Ghosts"" does have a certain charm, if only for its silliness. Maybe there's nothing particularly special about a visual effects-laden movie in which a family inherits a haunted house, but the movie definitely has its moments, namely when the lawyer ""splits"". Tony Shalhoub, Embeth Davidtz, Matthew Lillard, Shannon Elizabeth, Alec Roberts, Rah Digga and F. Murray Abraham are all able to turn in neat performances, even if the whole movie is pretty outlandish. I would recommend the original version more, but this one isn't bad. Perhaps its little more than a way to pass time, but a cool one at that. Acceptable for what it is.",Thir13en Ghosts
4,jboothmillard,Thir13en Ghosts,3,6 February 2009,"I had heard of this film and one of its female stars (from the popular teen comedies series), I guess I wanted to know why the critics give two out of five stars, but it's no surprise if it's from director Steve Beck (Ghost Ship). Basically Arthur Kriticos (Men in Black's Tony Shalhoub) and his family, daughter Kathy (American Pie's Shannon Elizabeth) and son Robert 'Bobby' (Alec Roberts), along with nanny Maggie Bess (singer Rah Digga) have been left a large by recently killed relative Cyrus Kriticos (F. Murray Abraham). They immediately like what they could be living in, but it only lasts a few minutes as Bobby quickly disappears, and one by one, they see ghosts. Cyrus was not just a collector of beautiful artifacts, but of spirits, twelve to be exact, thirteen being Cyrus himself (I presume). Trying to help the family get out alive, stop the machine ""designed by the devil and powered by the dead"" and free the spirits, are ghost hunter Dennis Rafkin (Scream's Matthew Lillard) and his rival Kalina Oretzia (Matilda's Embeth Davidtz). Also starring J.R. Bourne as Benjamin Moss and Matthew Harrison as Damon. The effects are pretty lame, there is only one reasonable death scene, and the performances are very lousy, well, so is the film. I have to say I recognised much of the footage being spoofed in Scary Movie 2, and to be honest, I couldn't take the real (remake) film too seriously. Adequate!",Thir13en Ghosts
5,ma-cortes,"A family inherits what proves to be a haunted house, but a special pair of goggles allows them to see their ghostly tormentors",6,6 October 2012,"This is a chiller remake with grisly horror, genuine chills and shocks . When Cyrus Kriticos (F. Murray Abraham) , a very rich collector of unique things dies, he leaves it all to his nephew and his family. All including his house, his fortune, and his malicious collection of ghosts. As reclusive Dr. Zorba has died and left his eerie mansion to his penniless nephew Cyrus Zorba (Tony Shaloub) and his sons (Shannon Elizabeth , Alec Roberts) . Along with the house, the Zorba family has also inherited the occultist's collection of 12 ghosts (Laura Mennell as The Bound Woman , Kathryn Anderson as The Withered Lover , Craig Olejnik as The Torn Prince , Shawna Loyer as The Angry Princess , Xantha Radley as The Pilgrimess , Ernst Harth as The Great Child , Laurie Soper as The Dire Mother , Herbert Duncanson as The Hammer), who can only be seen through Zorba's special goggles.The house suddenly closes itself and they encounter trapped inside and soon supernatural creepiness begin frightening the hosts . Then they'll spend a ghastly night in the spooky house with killings-laden history . The family members, their lives at risk upon the discovery a strange book that lies hidden somewhere in the house , they receive aid from unexpected woman (Embeth Davidtz) as the threat to their lives is revealed .This eerie story contains bit good fun with grisly killing , relentless horror and lots of blood and gore. The chiller version packs genuine chills and terrifying deaths such as a horrible quartering . It's silly but amusing fun and with an excessive use of computer generator FX and special make-up in charge of Robert Kurtzman , Howard Berger and Greg Nicotero . The monstrous ghosts are the real stars of this production , being rightly realized by means of an excellent make-up and magnificent special effects . Some scenes are clumsily shot but the movie has some good moments here and there , the illogical parts in the argument are more than compensated for the excitement provided by the creepy ghosts . The film was lavishly produced by Dark Castle , production specialized on terror genre and in charge of Joel Silver , Robert Zemeckis and Gilbert Adler ; both of them have produced successful terror movies dealing with eerie tales about horror , grisly killings and lots of blood and gore such as ¨House of haunted hill¨, ¨Return to house of haunted hill¨ , ¨Gothika¨, ¨Ghost ship¨, ¨House of wax¨ , Whiteout¨ , ¨Splice¨ , ¨The reaping¨ , ¨Orphan¨ , among others . The motion picture was professionally directed though without originality by Steven Beck who subsequently filmed ¨Ghost ship¨. The film resulted to be an acceptable but inferior remake from superior ¨13 ghosts¨ by William Castle . It was plenty of gimmicks, leaps from the screen and surprises descending on cinema-goers such as hidden wires and others . Of course the biggest film about this astonishing story is this vintage 1960 classic version rendition by William Castle that was starred by Charles Herbert as Buck Zorba , Jo Morrow as Medea Zorba , Martin Milner as Benjamen Rush , Rosemary DeCamp as Hilda Zorba and Donald Woods as Cyrus Zorba .",Thir13en Ghosts
6,BA_Harrison,Modera13ly en13rtaining schlock.,6,14 September 2009,"By following plans detailed in a book written by Basilius, a 15th century astrologer suffering from demonic possession, multi-millionaire Cyrus Kriticos (F. Murray Abraham) constructs a huge, glass-walled house which is, in reality, the Ocularis Infernum, a magical machine 'designed by the devil and powered by the dead' which can open the 'Eye of Hell' and imbue its operator with incredible powers.When Cyrus is suddenly killed, his almost destitute nephew Arthur (Tony Shalhoub) inherits the property, unaware of its true, diabolical purpose. Accompanied by his children, Kathy (Shannon Elizabeth) and Bobby (Alec Roberts), and nanny Maggie (Rah Digga), Arthur pays a visit to his new home, where he discovers the horrifying truth about the building (courtesy of Cyrus' flaky psychic associate Dennis Rafkin, played by Matthew Lillard), and comes face to face with the source of its power: the Thir13en Ghosts!The second William Castle film to be given the remake treatment by Dark Castle (after The House on Haunted Hill), Thir13en Ghosts' plot doesn't really stand up to close scrutiny, leaving plenty of unanswered questions: what is the story behind each ghost? Where exactly can you place a bulk order for sheet glass engraved with Latin containment spells? How can Arthur afford home help? Why doesn't Kathy take a shower?.But although the film's premise sure takes a lot of swallowing, and the action ultimately becomes completely incomprehensible, swamped by a glut of fancy visual effects and irritating editing, there's just about enough fun to be had with this brainless throwback to B-movie horror to make it worth a look: the script contains some witty lines of dialogue (Dennis Rafkin: 'I hunt ghosts!' Arthur Kriticos: 'Goats?'), there's a bit of outrageous gore courtesy of leading effects guys Kurtzman, Nicotero and Berger (a body sliding slowly apart after being sliced vertically by a sheet of glass is very impressive), the fine cast give solid performances, and the whole shebang benefits from lovely production design, with the house itself being the real star of the piece.",Thir13en Ghosts

His elaborate, mechanized estate, glass-encased and ""powered by the dead,"" is then turned over to his nephew, a widower math teacher with a grown daughter, a young son and his sassy nanny, who could use the new digs after being rendered nearly destitute by a fire which killed the Mrs. Very loose remake of William Castle's 1960 horror-comic was directed by Steve Beck in his debut. Beck, who had previously worked as a visual effects art director, ensures a good-looking movie with amazing, goosebumpy atmospherics and assorted grotesqueries, but he hasn't yet developed a talent for handling actors. The obnoxious kid is one thing, but Matthew Lillard's over-the-top performance as Cyrus' psychic assistant--who unfortunately survives the prologue--and J. R. Bourne's shifty-eyed turn as Cyrus' lawyer are wincingly amateurish, unworthy of a major studio production. Maybe these actors thought they were in a campy movie on the level of Castle's original? In the lead role, Tony Shalhoub does a nice job, and F. Murray Abraham gets a chance to be deviously sinister as Cyrus, but nothing else here rises to the level of the film's polished look. *1/2 from ****",Thir13en Ghosts
8,paul_haakonsen,Good old fun...,6,15 December 2015,"Having seen ""Thirteen Ghosts"" about four or five times already, I can say that the movie continues to be entertaining when revisited with some years in between. And I simply refuse to refer to the movie as ""Thir13en Ghosts""; I am not a hipster having to include numbers in with letters.It is the story and ghost design that makes the movie being fun to watch again and again. The concept of trapping ghosts in a house and unleashing them to wreck havoc is just downright fun. And the designs of the ideas for the various ghosts is nothing short of visually great. They always impress me.The effects in ""Thirteen Ghosts"" are quite good and really adds to the enjoyment of the movie.It should be said that the acting in the movie was good, and especially Tony Shalhoub impressed in ""Thirteen Ghosts"". Normally I am not much fan of Matthew Lillard, but he was actually quite good in this movie. And F. Murray Abraham as Cyrus was just perfectly cast.""Thirteen Ghosts"" is not a scary movie as per se, but it is worth watching for the story and the special effects.",Thir13en Ghosts
9,Coventry,"""Who you gonna call?! Ghost-bastards!""",3,2 February 2006,"Despite being an admirer of the eccentric director William Castle, I sadly never saw his original version of ""13 Ghosts"". Supposedly that's not such a big loss, since Castle's movies were only worth seeing in the theater at the time they came out because they involved a lot of ingenious gimmicks and appealing promotional stunts. During the release of ""13 Ghosts"", for example, the audience received 3-D glasses before the film started. This well-budgeted Dark Castle Productions remake naturally didn't had any imaginative gimmicks and it's an overall bad and imbecile film. Sad widower Arthur Kriticos and his offspring inherit a gigantic and bizarrely decorated mansion from their extravagant uncle Cyrus. Little do they know that uncle Cyrus was an avid ghost-collector and the basement of the house is congested with thirteen restless spirits, each representing a sign of the Dark Zodiac. The premise might sound interesting, but believe me, the film is an ineptly written and poorly directed bunch of pure nonsense. I didn't understand one iota about the whole Dark Zodiac explanations yet all the characters acted like it was the most common thing the world. The acting performances are truly inadequate, with a particularly annoying Matthew Lillard as some sort of spiritual medium and Shannon Elizabeth as a  surprise surprise  brainless beauty. In all honesty, I have to admit that the special and visual effects are fairly well mounted and they successfully distract us from the lame plot. Too bad director Steve Beck takes his own job so damn seriously and thus we can't really interpret ""Thirteen Ghosts"" as brainless kitsch.",Thir13en Ghosts
10,michaelRokeefe,Mass confusion laced with terror.,4,19 July 2002,"I'm not so sure this is not all smoke and mirrors.

Upon his accidental death he wills his fortune and new glass home to his nephew and his family. After arriving at the unbelievable abode, they soon realize they must deal with the warp-minded man's collection of ghosts. And they are not very happy. Tony Shaloub is the nephew, and in my opinion is miscast as the lead. Also in the cast are:F. Murray Abrams, Matthew Lillard and Rah Digga. Scary...yes. Thrills with spills...yes.

11,hitchcockthelegend,This is no Juggernaut.,3,28 October 2009,"Ghost hunter Cyrus Kriticos (F. Murray Abraham) and his physic assistant Dennis Rafkin (Matthew Lillard) have traced the ghost of Juggernaut (a serial killer called Horace ""Breaker"" Mahoney) to a junkyard. During the fight many are killed, including Cyrus, but Juggernaut is captured. Just why has Cyrus been collecting the ghosts of vengeful spirits? Enter Cyrus's nephew, Arthur (Tony Shalhoub), and his two children, who since the tragic death of their wife and mother respectively have fell on hard times. They are informed via the family estate lawyer that they have inherited Cyrus's bizarre maze of a mansion. So with babysitter Maggie in tow, they enter their dream home along with the suddenly appeared Rafkin, who is looking to get paid the money that Cyrus still owes him, and the lawyer. From where they unwittingly activate a machine that unleashes 12 murderous and vengeful ghosts.Produced by Robert Zemeckis and Joel Silver, it's no wonder that this remake of William Castle's fun and creaky 1960 film of the same name is a ball of noise and bedlam. Dispensing with Castle's creepy house formula, the makers here go for attempted psychopathic gross out set amongst a complex story, within a science fiction type mansion. The house works as a spectacle, the glass and metal revolves and slides and acts as a ghost prison-cum-deadly weapon in itself. But the makers forgot one very basic ingredient, it's just not scary-at all. Once the ghosts are unleashed, a vile looking and odd bunch they be, the whole bloody shrieking and banging things antics quickly grows tiresome. All sense of peril and potential hope for gore disappears, rapidly replaced by bad acting and potential harm to our eyes and ears. It's a shame because the premise is a dandy, if only they had thought it thru and hired better writers and a better director than the hopelessly out of his depth Steve Beck.To rub salt into the already weary wounds, upon searching thru the DVD of the film we find the ghosts have unique and interesting back stories. Now that would surely have made a better film one feels. Some nice design and a couple of tricksy moments aside, this Thirteen Ghosts just about scrapes in as a drunken time filler. 3.5/10",Thir13en Ghosts
12,Theo Robertson,Gave Me A Headache,2,11 September 2003,"The opening scene of 13 GHOSTS instantly reminded me of umpteen other sources . The scrapyard reminded me of Freddy`s resurrection in NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET 3 , and with the involvement of a secret paramilitary organisation I couldn`t help but be reminded of these pre credit hooks in THE X-FILES . An ethereal voice ? Well fill in your own favourite voice from nowhere film moment .As the film continued I wasn`t really reminded of any other movies but became very aware of what is wrong with expensive genre movies coming out of Hollywood studios these days : A big budget spent on set design and CGI FX with an uninteresting script that`s completely empty on characterisation . That`s not the major complaint on this movie , my major complaint is this : The amount of strobe lighting . It`s very irresponsible of film makers to allow this . Even if you don`t suffer from photo sensitive epilepsy - And if you do then do NOT under any circumstances watch this movie because it`ll give you a fit - the amount of flashing lights between edits will give you a blinding headache , so much so you`ll probably want to switch off the TV . Having said that even if there was no strobe lighting I would have been hard pressed not to turn off the TV anyway because this is one boring movie overflowing with crap CGI and wafer thin charactersOne last point - One of the characters is told to join Greenpeace in order to "" Throw paint on womens` fur coats "" I wish to point out that as a former member of Greenpeace the organisation doesn`t allow this type of violent behaviour .

13,Hey_Sweden,Not as bad as some reviews indicate.,6,8 October 2012,"21st century remake of the William Castle gimmick classic is evidence of that old adage that bigger ain't necessarily better. It has all of the special effects that money can buy, and action to spare, but completely lacks any sense of subtlety or atmosphere. The story has a struggling family - father Arthur (Tony Shalhoub), daughter Kathy (Shannon Elizabeth), and son Bobby (Alec Roberts), with nanny Maggie (rapper Rah Digga) in tow, coming into possession of a house owned by Arthur's late uncle Cyrus (Oscar winner F. Murray Abraham). What they don't know is that Cyrus was evil and designed a house of horrors, with an abundance of windows and a collection of angry, ugly looking spirits whom Cyrus has been collecting, with the help of a whiny character named Dennis (Matthew Lillard). Shalhoub and Lillard compete to see who can overact more, while fortunately Abraham doesn't act like the material is beneath him but gives his all in each of his scenes. Embeth Davidtz co-stars as the spirit specialist who supposedly is on hand to rescue the family and help them solve their problem. However, as anyone can guess, spectacle takes precedence over characterization as people get terrorized and bounced around inside this haunted house. The great conceit of the Castle original does get carried over to this film, in a way; back in 1960 theatre patrons were given glasses that would allow them to see the ghosts. Here characters in the film are given glasses to make the ghosts visible. The KNB group do an admittedly impressive job at giving us a macabre rogue's gallery of nasty looking spirits (the Jackal has to rate as this viewer's personal favourite), but the real star of ""Thir13en Ghosts"" is the house itself, a triumph of production design, art direction, set decoration, and special effects work. The film really doesn't do that bad a job of creating a funhouse feel, but it could have been pulled pack a bit to build up a little more mood and ambiance. As it is, it's reasonably fun but never exactly scary. One good thing is that the film goes on no longer than it needs to; pacing is not an issue. It should be adequate entertainment for some horror fans. Six out of 10.",Thir13en Ghosts
14,preppy-3,Better than the original,7,26 October 2001,"The original 1960 ""13 Ghosts"" was a very boring, stupid horror film. This one, while no classic, is actually quite good.A grieving widower Arthur (Tony Shalhoub), his hot daughter (Shannon Elizabeth), annoying son (Alec Roberts) and feisty black maid/cook/babysitter/whatever (Rah Digga) get trapped in an all glass house with a sort of psychic (Matthew Lilliard) and a ghost liberator (Embeth Davidtz). It was set up by the evil Cyrus (F. Murray Abraham) and he has 12 murderous ghosts in cages down in the basement. But they all get out, one by one, and go after the family.This is pretty dull stuff until they get locked in the house, the ghosts escape...then the movie REALLY gets going. The ghosts are very brutal-looking and their attacks are bloody and violent. In a nice tip of the hat to the original, people in the movie can only see the ghosts when they have special glasses on. The special effects are excellent and it has more than a few scary scenes. The plot does go out the window at the end, but I was still interested.The acting--Shalhoub is OK as the father. Davidtz is in it for the money (and her character is badly written). Lilliard goes way over the top...as always (take a few Valium bud)...seriously, can't this guy do anything but overact? Elizabeth is full of life and is viciously attacked in one scene but she's not in the movie enough. Roberts is just annoying as the kid. And F. Murray...he can play this villain role in his sleep...and he does. And Digga is funny but her character is cliché city.No masterpiece but not the disaster I was expecting.

15,poolandrews,"There's only one thing worse than being trapped in a haunted house with a ghost, being trapped in one with Thir13en Ghosts!",6,5 February 2005,"Thirt13en Ghosts starts in a junk yard, full with piles of old battered and wrecked cars. Cyrus Kriticos (F. Murray Abraham) is a wealthy collector. He is currently in the process of collecting twelve ghosts, with the help of a psychic named Dennis Rafkin (Matthew Lillard) who has the power to locate ghosts. He already has eleven. Cyrus, Dennis and their team of men are there to capture the twelfth. They succeed but at a price, many of Cyrus's men are killed as is Cyrus himself when his throat is slashed. Arthur Kriticos (Tony Shalhoub) lives alone in a small apartment with his daughter Kathy (Shannon Elizabeth) and young son Bobby (Alec Roberts) after the recent death of his wife in a fire. One morning while having breakfast there's a knock at the door. A lawyer named Benjamin Moss (JR Bourne) introduces himself. Moss represents Cyrus who has left everything he had to his only surviving relative, Arthur. Including his house he built, everyone is excited and start to wonder if their luck is beginning to change for the better. Moss says he will take them to the house which is about 2 hours from the city and located in a secluded & private wooded area called 'Willow Grove'. The Kriticos family and their annoying babysitter Maggie Bess (Rah Digga) arrive at the house and are shocked by what they see. Cyrus's house is spectacular, it's huge, the design is elaborate and made of what appears to be glass panels with strange writings on them. The house is quite simply stunning. Waiting at the door for them is a man who claims to be from the power company and has to check the circuit breakers, however the viewer knows that it is Dennis the psychic from the opening sequence. They all enter the house and start to explore their wonderful new home. Meanwhile when he senses an opportunity Moss steals a bag full of money which triggers a mechanism that locks the house down, trapping everyone inside. It also begins to release Cyrus's twelve ghosts that he kept in the basement from their protective cubes. Moss is quickly taken care of. Dennis starts to confess to Arthur the real reasons he is there and says there is no way out of the house. Arthur feels they should carry on the conversation outside and that they should find his children and get out. The writings on the glass panels are actually 'containment spells' which gives them some protection from the ghosts. Dennis also gives Arthur some special glasses which allow the wearer to see the ghosts. Kalina Oretzia (Embeth Davidtz) appears from nowhere and claims she is try so save the ghosts souls and that the house itself is a giant machine designed by the Devil and powered by the dead and has the ability to open the 'Eye of Hell'. The house needs Thirteen Ghosts and Cyrus collected twelve, The First Born Son (Mikhael Speidel), The Torso, The Gambler (Daniel Wesley), The Bound Woman (Laura Mennell), The Torn Prince (Craig Olejnik), The Angry Princess (Shawna Loyer), The Pilgrimess (Xantha Radley), The Great Child (C. Ernst Harth) & The Dire Mother (Laurie Soper), The Hammer (Herbert Duncanson), The Jackal (Shayne Wyler), The Juggernaut (John DeSantis) and The Withered Lover (Kathryn Anderson) who happens to be the ghost of Arthurs dead wife Jean. But the house supposedly needs thirteen ghosts so where is the thirteenth? Will Arthur be able to find his children and escape the house and stop the 'Eye to Hell' being opened? Directed by Steve Beck I thought this was a fairly decent Hollywood effort but it isn't anything particularly special. The script by Neal Marshall Stevens and Richard D'Ovidio is rather slow at times, particularly the middle third, but it does a reasonable job of keeping the viewer in the dark over what exactly is going on and reveals itself bit by bit although the actual twists when revealed aren't overly exciting or interesting. There's not much gore in it and only the lawyers death is any fun. CGI seems to have been kept to a minimum and the ghosts themselves are actors with special make-up effects applied, by the extremely reliable Robert Kurtzman, Gregory Nicotero and Howard Berger of KNB EFX's. They are very impressive to look at even if their severely underused and they just disappear for the final 20 odd minutes or so once the house and it mechanism starts to kick in. I must mention the production design by Sean Hargreaves and especially the house itself, it's extremely memorable is just plain cool and I would love to live in a house like this. Having said that it did get a little repetitive after a while as just about the entire film is set inside it, it also appears to be a lot bigger inside than out! It creates a visually interesting film to look at, even though in reality it would be very impractical, just imagine the window cleaning bill! The acting is OK but I found Maggie the babysitter very irritating as the obligatory 'comedy relief' character. Generally speaking it's well made and has a good polish about it, but with a budget this big that's the least I expect. I liked it to an extent, but it's nothing to get too excited about. Slightly above average and definitely worth a watch.",Thir13en Ghosts
16,utgard14,"""I used to hunt displaced spiritual energies with your uncle.""",4,5 August 2015,"A widower (Tony Shalhoub) with two kids learns he's inherited his dead uncle's house. It's not just any house, though, as the family finds out when they move in. The house is basically a glass prison for ghosts the uncle had captured. There's also some stuff about a machine but I'll let you watch to figure that out. Anyway, the family and some other folks become trapped inside the house with the ghosts. Oh heavens whatever will they do...Effects-driven remake of the William Castle classic isn't as much fun as the original but tries in its way. There's certainly a lot of scenery chewing going on. Unfortunately, there's too much emphasis on CGI and gore and not enough attention paid to actually making a scary movie. Director Steve Beck used to work for ILM, so I suppose it should come as no surprise he only cared about the special effects. The sets are nice, though, I'll give it that. The acting ranges from fine (Tony Shalhoub) to inept (Alec Roberts) to absolutely terrible (Matthew Lillard, one of the worst actors of all time). Also prepare yourself for Rah Digga's embarrassing turn as the stereotypical sassy black nanny. If it weren't for the profanity and people being bisected alive, I would've wondered what decade this was made in. Worth a look if you're into these types of things but, if you're hoping for a suspenseful and scary movie, look elsewhere.",Thir13en Ghosts

Some of the plot twists are pointless and the movie lacks a good final.The make-up however is fantastic, especially for the 13 ghosts.

The movie has a good quick pace and some nice camera-work.The concept is good: A man and his family are trapped in a glass house with ghosts in it.

The concept of the movie was intriguing to me because they were into capturing ghosts, non-ghostbuster style. Of course trying to harness ghosts might be a little dangerous, hence this becomes a scary movie.The inherited house was another cool feature. In fact it was probably the best feature of the entire movie. It was a glass death trap. It was a transforming glass house with a bunch of inscriptions on it to keep the ghosts in.

The main one in this one over the original is the house itself, which is incredibly impressive design and layout here that it's really unique and creative. The glass paneling and steel support frames provide the kind of basic look that is so unusual for any kind of film with its post-modern look that never seems to look livable but is more for look and appearance which succeeds wildly. This is one even before getting to all the mechanical devices, trap doors and even the writing all along the glass denoting all manner of spells and warnings that make this one of the most impressive, elaborate settings to place a film even before this one manages to utilize this great setting to fine effect here that really sets the fantastic stage for the spectacular ghost action throughout by putting it all inside such a great location. The opening to this in the car graveyard, which is the only scene outside the house, is the perfect start here with the crazy deaths showing cars being thrown around quite easily and really gets the freaky moments to add in with a fantastic sequence while getting the action in the house really nicely. The chases through the hallways are quite fun by letting the different ghosts and their gruesome looks which makes the scenes all the more fun. There's a large amount of the confrontations as well that provide not only the creepiness needed here while also making it thrilling as confrontations around the bathroom, around a pane of glass set-up as a barrier in the hallway and gong through their containment chambers in the basement are all incredibly enjoyable here. These fun attacks manage to bring about plenty of fun gore as well with plenty of gruesome, bloody deaths that go alongside the rather gruesome ghosts for a great time here, and along with the explosive action of the finale house destruction for all the great positives in this one. There's really only one flaw here for this one which is the fact that there's way too many important parts of the storyline introduced far too late into this one to get their full effect. The general gist of being there and them stumbling upon the ghosts is far more impressive when weighted against the wholly overblown stance this one puts forth in detailing the need for the specific ghosts and then being placed in the house to begin with. Otherwise, this was a highly enjoyable offering that has a lot of right with it.Rated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language and Nudity.",Thir13en Ghosts

The house in my view is kind of an eyesore and I don't see anyone wanting to live in a house like that.  No privacy whatsoever as even in the rooms with the more opaque glass you can still make a person out.  The house has a secret in its basement as it houses some mean ghosts.

I like this one because there is on cgi creature that looks like smoke at the end and I like Tony Shaloub from his days on the television show ""Wings"".

Admittedly it starts off as a dumb-yet-entertaining horror flick but midway through it turns into an utter disaster and actually becomes painful to watch. Take (specifically two) scenery-chewing actors, place them in a movie with a truly laughable plot and see who comes out unscathed. In fact the plot for ""Ghosts"" is sort of interesting and with a better director, cast and scriptwriter it really could have been developed into a terror-masterpiece, but due to the director deciding to make his film into a schlock horror slasher flick with constant camera cuts and an indecipherable plot, it becomes nothing but garbage.It really is a terrible, terrible film on almost every level - acting, directing, writing, etc. Perhaps the only good thing is the set design but then again since the director is always so busy trying to twirl and cut us around from scene to scene we rarely get a chance to breathe it all in.

Then, as the movie continues, it turns into more of a horror movie than a typical ghost movie (I don't necessarily consider those to be the same thing.) The problem is that it doesn't really work that well regardless of which genre you try to fit it into. No doubt it's creative. The story (once you figure it out - and it is a bit confusing) has to do with the so-called ""black zodiac"" and the attempts of a mysterious figure (played by F. Murray Abraham) to amass great power by capturing the ghosts required to fill out this zodiac. The zodiac requires twelve ghosts, all of whom have to fit a certain ""type,"" and then a 13th ghost is required - the ghost of a person who has to voluntarily give himself out of love. Cyrus (Abraham) chooses his nephew Arthur (Tony Shalhoub) to be the 13th ghost and lures them by faking his death and willing Arthur and his family a strange house, which isn't actually a house but a ""machine"" of sorts whose purpose is to bring forth the power Cyrus wants.The ""house/machine"" was both a strength and a weakness. It was very well designed and very mysterious, and yet it also seemed overdone in some ways. It was too much, and it - rather than the ghosts or the people - tended to become the focus of the movie. There are a handful of scenes of gore (notably the lawyer being sliced in half) and some decent enough frights and chills (confined mostly to the last half hour or so.) The story really isn't very well developed, though. The very last scene of the movie is an unfortunate attempt at humour that added nothing to one's memory or appreciation of the movie. It's a mediocre effort.",Thir13en Ghosts

In another life"".",5,3 September 2011,"After the success of ""House on Haunted Hill"", a couple years later Dark Castle entertainment would go on to produce another remake of a William Castle film; ""Thir13en Ghosts"". Adding 13 in to the title was the remake's own fancy novelty. I have never seen the original 1960's version, so I can't really compare, but for most part this eccentrically gimmicky horror staple was slickly made and mildly fun. It doesn't pretend to be anything else. Aiming for macabre fun. The execution in some aspects does pale in comparison to the concept. Really the inventive premise is archetypal, especially with the daft twists but it's the clockwork mansion along with its harbouring ghosts that make the day. The almighty mansion was a strikingly vivid creation, like some sort of mechanic Rubik's cube made of glass and bestowing an ominously demonic edge. While the spirits locked inside, each with their own distinguishable quality provided some unnerving images with their jerky, sped up movements and nasty encounters. The only ways they can be seen are with special glasses. Director Steve Beck goes on to create a forlorn funhouse atmosphere with dazzling computer effects, grisly make-up FX and numerous slow-motion visuals. While flashy, it does feel empty. This can be seen in some of the performances too; Tony Shalboub, Embeth Davidtz and Shannon Elizabeth (whose character has a real excitement for bathrooms). Although Mathew Lillard is a neurotic live-wire and Rah Digga annoys more so than entertains with her comical role. F. Murray Abraham shows up in a small part, but is probably the best of the lot.

In the inheritance is included a huge and very modern house that Arthur doesn't know to be haunted by a collection of evil spirits that his uncle hunted and imprisoned. The film has a truly frightening opening sequence that shows us how this man hunted and trapped the most cruel spirits. But then the film calms down, takes on a more cadenced rhythm and builds the ending, on a plot simpler and more psychological than one might expect. Suspense isn't effective as it should, some script solutions are forced and unnatural, even resorting to obvious clichés. There are several scenes of graphic violence somewhat shocking but this is not scary, it's disgusting. In contrast, the film is visually pleasing, with proper cinematography, good special effects and sound and an extraordinary setting. The house is something like I've never seen, combining tradition and modernity with a sinister touch, and the subplot around it was a plus point for the film. Tony Shalhoub (who still remembers this actor in Monk?) did a good job as lead actor and F. Murray Abraham also pleased me.

It contains every principal elemental ingredient of a good horror film: magick, intriguing characters, superb acting and direction and a truly creatively unique plot. The suspense factor is VERY high, and the ghosts are so well done, you can believe, if only for a moment, that they are real.Cyrus Kriticos, played by F. Murray Abraham, is a very wealthy man who has a unique obsession: he collects ghosts. But the spirits he enslaves aren't your run of the mill variety. What he collects are the most malevolent spirits imaginable. Driven by the ""Black Zodiac,"" and guided by a book most dire known as the ""Arcanum,"" Cyrus Kriticos endeavors to seal his fortune with the blood of his nephew and his family, but something goes wrong.""We are in the middle of a machine, designed by the Devil, and powered by the dead."" Kalina Oretzia, convincingly portrayed by Embeth Davidtz.After Cyrus's death, the Kriticos nephew, Authur, and his family move into the extraordinary house of glass designed by Cyrus, complete with ancient containment spells etched into the walls, ceilings and floors to keep his ""collection"" where it belongs. Ah, the plans of mice and men.But somewhere in this house, the spells are breached and the angry, murderous spirits are loosed upon the inhabitants of this magnificent house of alchemy and magick. Also trapped within the glass fortress is Dennis Rafkin (Matthew Lillard), Cyrus's unwitting assistant who, thankfully, at least knows what in the HECK is going on.""Somehow...we got behind enemy lines."" Dennis Rafkin I found the part of Dennis Rafkin, in particular, to be portrayed extremely well. His abilities as a psychic are extraordinary and successfully portrayed by Lillard. He even demonstrated the headaches often associated with the extraordinary talents such as those with which his character is gifted. A most impressive portrayal by Lillard, which I found surprising as I have never really been impressed with his abilities until this movie.Which means the directing was inspired. The sets and scenery were astounding and to crowbar such an outstanding performance from Lillard, Steve Beck shows promise. Unfortunately, I did not find his next endeavor, entitled ""Ghost Ship,"" to be much of anything. So this was, sadly, a fluke. Beginner's luck, as it were.The voices of the ghosts were wonderfully done, and the soundtrack lent highly to the suspense of the movie. The artwork, glyphs, and runic symbols used in the ancient tome of Cyrus's and all throughout the house were extremely creative and so very well done as to inspire me.The housing cells of the ghosts and the mechanisms which triggered them were truly inspired. I found the whole movie to be extraordinarily creative and unique. I've never seen anything even remotely this creative, and in my opinion, it has earned its place in the Horror Hall of Fame.This movie has twists and turns, humor among the horror and LOTS of ""scare-you!!!"" moments!This plot, the sets and scenery, the performances by all involved are ingenious. A total creative masterpiece of horror and magick. I love this movie! It was 3 times scarier on the big screen, but it still possesses the same ability to scare you, on the small screen. It is one of the best horror movies ever made, regardless of the ""Hollywood"" effects. These effects were so well done that they did not appear to BE effects at all. They did nothing but render the movie believable. You could actually believe these horrors exist.The use of silver flares against the spirits is also quite ingenious. Silver, one of the sacred metals, is effective against many forms of malevolent entities. Silver crucifixes and bullets and the like have been utilized devices for decades, centuries even, against these forms of Beings.A wonderful movie of love and life; a fine testimony of family and faith in yourself.This is one of the Fiend's favorite horror movies.

Arthur and his two children (Shannon Elizabeth, Alec Roberts) along with their talkative ""maid"" Rah Digga take possession of the house. Inside, with the help of Kriticos former assistant Dennis Rafkin (Matthew Lillard) they discover that the house has twelve frightening spirits imprisoned in the basement. One by one they are being released. Why?  With special glasses the humans are able to see the spirits, one of which is Arthur's dead wife. Along comes the mysterious Kalina (Embeth Davidtz) who explains that the ghosts are an the keys to Uncle Cyrus' plan to open the gates of hell. But to complete the rite, a thirteenth ghost, a living person, is needed. But who will it be? Is Kalina really what she seems to be? Is Uncle Cyrus really dead? Are the ghosts real? The performances by Shaloub, Abraham and Digga stand out from the rest. The ghosts are not computer generated but are real actors in frightening makeup that do provide some genuine scares. If you watch the DVD, there is an interesting featurette where Uncle Cyrus gives some background to each of the ghosts along with his reasons for choosing them for his ""project"". There is also another featurette that shows some of the actors playing the ghosts being made up for their roles. The best of the elaborate computer generated effects has to be the machine that controls the house. All in all this film is quite enjoyable and yes a little scary.",Thir13en Ghosts
45,dfranzen70,Not a ghost of a chance,1,16 April 2002,"Traditionally, a remake of a horror movie is going to stink. Sure, this can be said about more than half of all remakes, regardless of genre, but it's especially true with horror movies, because unless the new movie goes off in a completely new direction, the suspense and the fear factor have been eliminated.This was somewhat true with House on Haunted Hill (1999), which was a remake of the 1958 film of the same name, and it's even more true with this film, a remake of Roger Corman's 1960 movie.An eccentric rich dude (if he were poor, he'd just be weird) who loves collecting oddities bequeathes his house and all the goofy stuff in it to his unsuspecting nephew Arthur (Tony Shalhoub) and his family. The house is a gorgeous mansion, although it is stuffed with some truly gruesome antiquities. Oh, but the late Uncle Cyrus (whom Arthur met a couple of times, tops) certainly danced to a different drummer, so the weirdness quotient's acceptable. His house is away from everything else - not a neighbor for miles, the lawyer tells them all - lending a supposedly eerie atmosphere to the murky, muddled script.Arthur is joined by his lovely daughter Kathy (Shannon Elizabeth - you might remember her from being scantily clad in the American Pie movies), his morbid young son Bobby (Alec Roberts), and his son's nanny Maggie (Rah Digga). The mother died in a fire, a fact that's brought up more than once throughout the movie. It's all about ghosts, you see, just in case you were misled by the film's title. Ghosts and souls and fun, uplifting stuff like that.At any rate, the family gets this house, but weird things happen even before Arthur signs the paperwork. For one thing, there's the wacky dude named Rafkin (Matthew Lillard) who palled around with ol' Uncle Cyrus (played by F. Murray Abraham - remember when he won an Oscar for Amadeus? Poor guy can't catch a break now, generally playing heavies, but this is a new low for his career). Seems Rafkin knows more than a little about these weird goings on. So what's it all about? There are thirteen ghosts, collected there by Uncle Cyrus, and there's also a whole buncha money, safely stowed inside a whole horkin' ton of traps.But Arthur and his clan just want to get out of the house, which sealed itself shut as soon as possible. The ghosts don't want them to leave, y'see, because they're basically ghosts of Really Bad People (oh, and they can only be seen through use of these nifty special glasses). Naturally, the kids get lost, separated from their dad who must, with the dubious help of Rafkin, somehow locate them before they're tortured and killed by the spirits.This movie is about 95% screams - and no, that's not a good thing, no matter how enamored you are of slasher films. The plot is simplistic and is largely unnecessary, given the massive budget for effects (I'm reluctant to call them 'special'). There's much shrieking, probably so designed to distract the viewer from the unending, undying crappiness of the film itself. Forget the acting - there is none. These people take every cliche from the Great Book of Horror Movies and overact their way to stupendous boredom. It's a lesson in ennui, which is tough when you're trying to make a horror movie. One fun pasttime for those watching the movie is to see how dumb and gullible the characters are. This is a time-honored tradition; ever sit down and watch a cheesy 70s horror movie, pointing out the utter stupidity of the Dumb Blonde who comes back to the cabin to find none of her friends around, then proceeds to take a shower - with the bathroom door open? Sure, we've all done that. That's about all you can do with this waste of time, too. In the grand pantheon of horror movies, it's pretty awful, albeit slightly better than that benchmark of Crappidom, Blair Witch Project II: Book of Shadows.",Thir13en Ghosts

The storyline follows a down on their luck family who inherits a house, shortly after the mother passes away, from the fathers uncle. Little do they know their uncle was a ghost collector and them moving into the house may help the deceased uncle finish an experiment he had only just begun while amongst the living. This movie was directed by Steve Beck (Ghost Ship) and stars Tony Shalhoub (Galaxy Quest), Shanon Elizabeth (Savid by the Bell), Matthew Lillard (Scream) and F. Murray Abraham (Amadeus). The storyline for this movie is very entertaining and has so many great elements - the paranormal link by Lillard, the dynamics of the family, the house itself, the backstories of the ghosts...just so much to keep your attention and have you wanting to know what happens next. The acting by the entire cast is also well executed as you can really feel the perspectives of the characters, good and bad. The special effects of the ghosts are excellent, as is the gore and kill scenes. The is a gem of a movie with so many elements for horror movie fans to enjoy. I'd strongly recommend seeing this as this is a rare time the remake is better than the original. I'd score this a 8.5/10.",Thir13en Ghosts

49,drownnnsoda,"Jumpy, Flashy Spookfest.",7,16 August 2006,"""Thirteen Ghosts"" is the second movie made by Dark Castle Entertainment, who brought us the equally chilling ""House On Haunted Hill"" remake in 1999. This film is a remake of William Castle's 3-D ghost house romp. This movie opens with some real-life ""ghost hunters"" hunting ghosts in a wrecking yard, the ghost is very violent, lots of people die. We are then introduced into the Kriticos family, which consists of a father, his daughter and son, and their live-in nanny. Living in a cramped little apartment, they are happy when they inherit their uncle Arthur's glass-walled mansion after his death. Little do they know, Arthur was a ghost hunter, and the basement of the house contains sealed rooms that hold twelve assorted ghosts. When the family goes to see the house one evening, they meet a kooky electrician (who is actually a previous ghost hunter who worked for Arthur). And after entering the house, it seals shut, and begins to shift, hallways disappearing and changing, etc. Turns out this glass-walled ""house"" is a ghost machine, and as the night progresses, the ghosts below are released from their containment.This is one of those movies that is really flashy, jumpy, and loud. It uses these qualities as scare tactics, and they actually work in this film. The ghosts in the movie were scary as hell, each of them have a bit of a backstory and a name. The ghosts that freaked me out in particular were The Pilgrimess, The Angry Princess, and The Jackal. All of them were scary in their own ways, but out of them all, those ones stood out to me. The setting for the film was great, and the whole house set was magnificent - all the walls made of glass, glass floors, etc. It looked awesome, some real credit must go to the set-designers because they did a stunning job.The special effects were great as well, especially the makeup used on the unique ghosts, and it had plenty of startling action sequences. The acting was decent, good enough in the context of the movie. And the realtor's death was probably the best in the whole film, very original and gruesome. I liked how they incorporated the ""glasses"" theme into this movie. In the original 1960 version, you had to wear actual 3-D glasses to see the ghosts. In this movie, the characters must wear special glasses to see them. However, behind all the amazing visuals, the story suffers a little bit.Overall, ""Thirteen Ghosts"" is an entertaining ghost-themed horror movie. It's not necessarily scary, but it's startling on many occasions and the ghosts in the movie were really creepy and unique, I've never seen ones quite like this in a horror film. Don't expect a suspenseful mystery thriller, but if you like supernatural horror movies that are jumpy and flashy, you'll enjoy this. 7/10.",Thir13en Ghosts

Director Steve Beck does a great job here with all the wild thrills & crazy monster fx & the huge glass designed spook house & a solid little cast, shame Steve Beck only directed two films this flick & the equally excellent ""Ghost Ship"" that came out the following year, both big budget supernatural Horror films that are beautifully designed with it's top class production & both full of thrills, fun & excitement, not to mention fantastic gory bloody scenes of carnage, i have big love & Nostalgia for these films.13 Ghosts came out at a time of a kind of Ghosts films revival that started in the late 90's with remakes of The House on Haunted Hill & The Haunting & then came this (13 ghosts) & then came Ghost Ship (2002) all of which are very good movies!!!
13 Ghosts is pure Horror fun even if it's supposed to be taken seriously it's just made in a way that comes accross fun but it's made well with a big budget & excellent production design & a nice Family message at heart & a fun little cast especially the always good & underrated over the top Mathew Lillard, who here plays a tortured psychic to the spirit world.
I remember these Ghost films when each came out & saw most of them at the cinema except this one!!! So i was Big fan of these flicks & the Horror genre massively so 13 just fit nicely into this new bigger budget supernatural films & plays with a nice tone of adventure & Horror & i dig it.13 is an easy watch & a fun Horror film a nice film to double feature with House on Haunted Hill or Ghost Ship!!!",Thir13en Ghosts
51,davispittman,Pretty lackluster horror movie,3,3 August 2017,"Thirteen Ghosts is a very poorly done horror movie. The film gets just about everything wrong. I love Tony Shaloub in the show everyone knows him from, Monk. But in this movie, I really didn't care for his performance or his character. He didn't really make you care about him, and the other characters were kinda hard to care about too, since the film didn't develop them in any way. The actors didn't do their characters justice and the plot didn't allow for development of them, double failure. The plot itself is pretty poor and uninteresting too, you won't finish this movie and think that it was interesting, you'll think that it was an opportunity missed, a failed attempt. The movie did nothing to keep your interest, it simply told an uninteresting story filled with equally uninteresting characters. If you're looking for a scary movie that's actually worth watching, then I suggest The Others or something like that, because this one falls flat. The only thing I can say for it is that the visuals are kind of interesting but that's the only somewhat good thing about it. 3/10 for Thirteen Ghosts.",Thir13en Ghosts

He made a fun, entertaining, claustrophobic but flawed supernatural thriller. Although it's lacks certain scares. But thanks to a good cast, excellent production designs, imaginative make-up effects and strong visual effects makes this surprisingly good looking horror movie. The film has a few plot holes, style over substance wins this movie over. One of the film highlights in the cinematography by Gale Tattersall (The Addams Family).This is a remake from a William Castle film from the original 3-D movie by the same name. This movie is remade from the original storyline by Robb White. The updated screenplay is by Neal Marshall Stevens and Richard D'Ovidio. This is the second remake from William Caste, the first was the trashy but creepy and enjoyable ""House on Haunted Hill"" (1999).The remake is produced by Gilbert Alder (Tales from the Crypt Presents:Bordello of Blood), Joel Silver (The Matrix Trilogy) and Robert Zemeckis (Contact). DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (1.78:1) transfer and an strong- Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD has an entertaining commentary track by the director, production designer and make-up effects supervisor. The DVD Best Feature is the Ghost Files, narrated by F.Murray Abraham. Which does explain each Ghost of the film. DVD also has the behind the scenes featurette, theatrical trailer and an music video.

54,rbverhoef,If you like the genre...,6,12 December 2004,"'Thir13en Ghosts' is a movie with lots of flashing images and loud sounds. Most of the time that is a little annoying, although there are moments it adds something to the scary events that happen. I am not a big fan of the horror-genre, although I can appreciate it when it is done good. Here you have no real story, but there are some real scares. Since it is about ghosts those things can turn up anytime and anywhere. One of the characters even explains that ""they like to do that"".To explain the story would be quite pointless. What I can say is that a family without a mother but including dad Arthur (Tony Shalhboub), daughter Kathy (Shannon Elizabeth), son Bobby (Alec Roberts) and nanny Maggie (Rah Digga) inherits a strange house, created by their uncle Cyrus (F. Murray Abraham). We learn that Cyrus was a ghost hunter, of course with a purpose and a thirteenth ghost as the answer to a mystery, and that twelve ghosts are locked in the basement of the house. Two other characters are in the house as well. Dennis (Matthew Lillard) who sees future and past when he touches people and who used to work with Cyrus, and an opponent of Cyrus named Kalina (Embeth Davidtz). When the ghosts are unleashed they have to save themselves.I realize I actually have told you the story, but that is not what this movie is about. What makes it at least interesting is the visual style of the movie. The house looks great, the effects and art direction are very admirable. That there is hardly time to notice that is a shame. The scares might be stupid but they work enough to make this a real horror movie. Yes, there are many flaws and things go terribly wrong near the end, but if you normally like these kind of movies, you must be able to enjoy 'Thir13en Ghosts'.",Thir13en Ghosts
55,Spleen,Even collectors of bad movies have been ripped off with this one,1,27 September 2002,"""Thirteen Ghosts"" was no more made in the earnest hope or expectation that people would enjoy it than a ten-by-ten centimetre postage stamp is minted with the expectation that people will use it to mail letters. No; this movie, like the stamp, was made expressly for curio collectors of one kind or another. As such it isn't even a real curio.It wouldn't be so bad to watch a set of poorly-drawn ""characters"" move without purpose through such an idiotic, jury-rigged plot, if the film weren't so deeply, minute-for-minute unpleasant. To start with it's loud. Not just loud because there are events taking place which as it so happens produce a lot of noise, but loud because the sound engineers wanted to assault our eardrums; WHATEVER happens on the screen, they do what they can to ensure that it fills the dynamic spectrum entirely, producing an ear-splitting din that's only just this side of physical pain. There's gore everywhere, when there's no need (insofar as the story makes sense) for ANY gore. The people are needlessly nasty to one another and the footage is not so much edited as shredded. You don't seriously mean to say that there are people who LIKE watching this kind of stuff? If there are, there shouldn't be.Some people praise the set design, but you won't catch me doing so. It might have sounded like a neat idea to have every single wall and floor and ceiling made of sturdy clear glass, with Latin phrases written on every surface in white letters, and it may even have looked impressive to the cast and crew as they walked around the set, but to us, it's just shopping-mall chaos that hurts the eyes and conveys nothing. And what's the POINT, visually speaking, of having the house reconfigure itself, if it ends up looking precisely the same after as before?",Thir13en Ghosts
56,lemon_magic,Energetic (if shallow) performances and vivid eye candy,7,13 November 2005,"I like ""Thir13n Ghosts"" (or whatever) very much for what it is - an triumph of art design, sound design, makeup effects, and roller-coaster plotting. No, the writing and the acting aren't going to win any awards (although I think Shaloub and Lillard are quite effective in their roles), because all the characters are cardboard cutouts who exist only to be menaced, knocked off or eviscerated. On that level, it's little more than ""Friday the Thir13nth"" (heh) with the ghosts standing in for Jason. But there's cereal box cardboard and then there's masonite cardboard. The actors here are pros who deliver their lines with energy and conviction and they work hard to make their roles believable and interesting. No one here sucks the way the actors in, say, ""House Of The Dead"" suck. No, things aren't particularly scary - or at least, not in a creepy, unsettling sense. The scares and thrills here are strictly of the ""I...GOTCHA!!!!"" variety, with the Bogeyman jumping out from an unexpected direction and doing something horrible to a victim. But they do exist, and some of the events carry real weight and impact (what happens to the lawyer is enough to make anyone flinch). And boy, is this movie fun to look at and listen to. The sets and the makeup are the real stars here, and loving care has obviously been lavished on each and every detail, from the Art Deco frills on the knick-knacks in the cabinets to the shattered, deformed slats on the cage around the Juggernaut's head, to the cryptic runes inscribed on the transparent shatter proof walls that slide around and trap or release people or ghosts in unpredictable ways (and in one case, slice a hapless victim in half). For all the lack of depth and originality in the plot, set designers and makeup and SFX artists must have worked themselves into comas with all the cool stuff they came up with. And the sound design (easy to overlook in a visual film like this) is the same way - layered and sophisticated and completely immersive. So in essence: Eye (and ear) candy, supported by just enough plot and acting chops to make this a movie instead of an extended MTV goth metal music video. Fans of Tony Shaloub (I'm one) or Matthew Lillard (him too) will also get enough of their participation to justify the time watching the movie. I picked it up used on DVD for $10 a three years ago, and am still happy with my purchase. I watch it for laughs for Halloween and horror oriented movie nights, and enjoy it each time.

The only thing I like about this remake is that the on-screen actor must use the special glasses gimmick to see the ghosts (but here the audience does not).

It's all glass and designed to be a ""spook central"" to attract and manipulate 12 spirits, as the next victim will become the 13th ghost, like the original film. In full gory-color and painfully-loud sound, it is a torturous experience with a familiar feel to it as some of the extra characters are horribly mangled, chopped, or crushed to death. There are a few friendly ghosts ""in the family"" and a small bit of surprising humor as well. I didn't like it, and barely made it through without turning it off in complete disgust.

It's a pretty cool movie for late night with the lights out--there is no shortage of grisly and scary moments.Monk is challenged to a chess-like game of wits with Evil personified, I guess it was supposed to be the Devil himself: he grins and laughs a lot, and likes to brag about robbing souls and so on. Monk has to figure out the Evil One's deceptions to avoid an unpleasant fate. Pretty good story, although a few dots never get connected, and the plot is loosely done.

The set is amazing, the ghosts are incredible and some of them deserved their own individual films. And conceptually it's truly a unique and appreciated cinematic experience. That being said it's a bad movie with a goofy screenplay and awful performances. Only Matthew Lillard manages to rise above the material. The film centers on a family that's given an ultra stylish glass house by a rich, deceased relative. The bad thing is that it is filled with some of the world's worst ghosts and the house is a machine that releases them one at a time to wreak havoc as part of an ultimate ritual. The movie is dumb and exploitative but it is fun. And the gimmicks mostly work.

It has a great cast and I also thought it was sort of fun in a way. But the film has the same story, pretty much, as House on haunted hill with Geoffry Rush. Well, I preferred that film anyways. I think that the performances and the scares in that film were a bit better. The plot was a bit more original also, though the two films were both remakes. I don't know, I just think that House on Haunted hill is a tad better and scarier. I'm not saying that 13 ghosts is a bad film, I just prefer House on Haunted hill. I think that some of the scenes in 13 ghosts are just unnecessary. I did find 13 ghost enjoyable and I appreciated it, though there were some unnecessary scenes.

And yes this movie totally lacks a story with a little weight to it, but then again, so did William Castle's original ""13 Ghosts"" film from 1960. And the conclusion/final doesn't add up to much either, I agree. But the set design, sound & make-up effects were awesome. So the movie's worth seeing for that alone, and that's why I enjoyed re-watching it on DVD. Matthew Lillard might be severely overacting again, but I still had fun with him. At least in this film. Unfortunately, F. Murray Abraham's character surprisingly not being dead after all was a pretty stupid twist just for twist's sake.

Only a few ghosts out of the 12 got featured, I felt shortchanged.Maybe there was too much about the family for me..then again, maybe too little. Maybe the family didn't have enough goose-bumpy peril for me. I REALLY liked the daughter washing her face in the new bathroom scene. Maybe there should have been ALOT more of that kind of suspense/horror. I loved what happened to the Lawyer. I HATED the ending, it just fell apart for me.

Everyone gets their own bathrooms!,2,14 February 2005,"This was a horrible horror film, so to ensure that I don't sound clichéd with my review, I am going to write out thir13en ways that this film could have been improved.1. Hacking somebody to bits sells a horror film, not huge boobs. While some may enjoy scenes like this, I find that it distracts from the bigger picture. One of the ghosts had ""huge boobs"" power, which was not very scary in my eyes. What was she going to do? Poke somebody's eye out with the enormous nipples? I don't think she would have sent anyone away in fear. I think most would just cozy in for a warm winter's nap  because it wouldn't be the holidays if it wasn't much hooter  hotter at the malls."" 2. I don't want to sound racist, but the family seemed to be a bit mismatched. Were all the kids adopted? None of them resembled Tony Shalhoub at all. They didn't even look like their burnt mother. I was confused. They also were very disrespectful of a man that just lost his wife to fire. Everybody knows that a fire death takes anywhere from four to eight months recovery. You shouldn't rush him into normality if you can. 3. I did enjoy the cameo from the guy in the movie Se7en. It is always good when directors that randomly throw in numbers in their title to create a symbolic reference can use the same actors. Look for the guy from Se7en that ate himself to death, then look for the guy that ate himself to death in Thir13en Ghosts. I think you will be able to spot him well. 4. Matthew Lillard needs to stop working  NOW. 5. I enjoyed this film better when the characters had names like Peter, Ray, Egon, and Winston and when they battled guys like Slimer and the Stay-Puffed Marshmallow Man. I mean, there was nothing in this film warning people not to cross their beams. That is a warning that should have been mention. 6. For some odd reason I never saw 13 ghosts. I was counting too. I think, at the most, I saw five. I think some people in the marketing department got the ax after this film. 7. Did anyone catch the phrase ""Semper Ubi Sub Ubi"" written on one of the walls. Not cool. 8. Apparently, in this film, the only way to get rid of ghosts is by throwing a flare at them. Now really people, you could tell that the production team had run out of a budget after developing the glasses and had to resort to flare throwing as a battle weapon. These ghosts needed to realize that they were already DEAD, flares wouldn't hurt them. See, never forget the rules. Train your ghost first, then let him terrorize. 9. Have your ghosts work for you. This was a very common problem in this film. The ghosts were not working for anyone. If you have 13 spirits that need employment, do not allow them to just sit around and sulk. Get working or get out. Kriticos must have been a softy in the workforce because these spirits did not listen to anything or follow any directions. Ghosts need discipline just like you and I. 10. Matthew Lillard needs to stop working  NOW.11. Can anybody explain to me what F. Murray Abraham was doing in this film? This man is an Oscar winner and he is forced to do work like this? I have no hope for Hollywood. 12. Glasshouses need consistency. This film did not, and the first reason why is because the bathroom was not made of glass (unlike the rest of the house). Consistency. Learn this and you may have mastered the ways of the horror genre. 13. (Nothing. There were not 13 ghosts so why should I have to worry about 13 points? Riddle me that bucko!)Overall, this was a horrible film that somehow needed to be watched just once than forgotten about for the remaining days of my existence. Skip it, and you will die a very happy person. Watch it  and you may become one of the (DUM DAH DAH.) Thir13en Ghosts.Grade: * out of *****",Thir13en Ghosts
66,IonicBreezeMachine,"Overproduced and NEVER scary even for a moment, but there's entertainment from its sheer excess.",6,30 November 2020,"Arthur Kriticos (Tony Shalhoub) is a struggling widower steel reeling from the loss of his wife in a fire. When Arthur's Uncle Cyrus (F. Murray Abraham) leaves him a large mansion the the Kriticos' family eagerly accept, however once there the family discover they're now part of an insidious plan involving a menagerie of ghosts and an infernal machine.Thir13en Ghosts is one of a number of films from Walter Hill and Robert Zemeckis' Dark Castle Productions. Like the company's first film (House on Haunted Hill), Thir13en Ghosts is a remake of a William Castle movie of the same name. Despite being a horror film the movie isn't scary, but it's never boring.The movie's strengths are mainly in its production design and a few key performances. The house has this mechanical asthetic that makes it stand out from other haunted houses. With its predominantly glass structure and series of interlocking gears and mechanisms, the movie has memorable environments. The make up effects on the titular thirteen ghosts are also fairly impressive (even if they're not particularly scary). F. Murray Abraham gives a fun performance as Cyrus Kriticos and Matthew Lillard is really good as psychic Dennis, but the rest of the cast is saddled with fairly uninteresting roles that feel more like place fillers and are designed to fill types rather than create compelling characters. Usually reliable Tony Shalhoub is saddled with the rote skeptic role who doesn't believe in ghosts and while this cliche is annoying in pretty much any haunted house movie, it makes even less sense here.The movie is never scary for even a minute. There's no building of atmosphere or any creepy scenes, and the movie is paced more like an action/adventure movie instead of a horror film. Steve Beck also overuses bright lights and flash cuts that are supposed to be surprising but come off more as annoying and detract from the solid production design and make up effects.Thir13en Ghosts is a serviceable haunted house movie provided you dont care about its lack of scares. While the movie lacks the scares of other haunted house movies, it does have some great technical details, production design, and make-up effects that do make it enjoyable.",Thir13en Ghosts

68,jhclues,"Thirteen Is One Ghost Too Many, Perhaps... (5/10)",5,2 November 2002,"There's nothing like a good ghost story to get the juices flowing, and not one that merely opens a creaky closet door and says, `Boo!' but one that grabs! you by the nape of the neck and commands your attention with a bona fide scare.  Unfortunately, such films are few and far between, and though `Thir13en Ghosts,' directed by Steve Beck, is perhaps not the `Grand Guignol' it aspires to be, it is nevertheless a valiant attempt and will do in a pinch.  And it does have the added bonus of having something of a unique twist to it:  Whereas most stories dealing with supernatural apparitions are the result of chance encounters or happenstance, even those set within the tried and true venue of the `haunted house,' the spirits confronted here do not arise from accident, but by design.  The burning question becomes, of course, by whose design and for what purpose?  Ah, but therein lies our story, eh?In the film's prologue, we are introduced to one Cyrus Kriticos (F. Murray Abraham), a man of obvious wealth and means who has apparently made it his life's work to capture the disenfranchised spirits of those who have died a violent death, encasing them in holding cubes made of impenetrable glass. But before the opening credits have ended, Cyrus falls victim to one of his intended trophies, a particularly rambunctious soul who apparently doesn't take kindly to the idea of being kept in a cage.Upon the passing of Cyrus Kriticos, his entire estate-- which is rather substantial-- is bequeathed to his nephew, Arthur Kriticos (Tony Shalhoub), a math teacher currently in the throes of some personal travails, who barely knew his uncle and had, in fact, only met him once or twice in his life.  As often happens in life, however, it is from this least expected source that Arthur seemingly finds the solution to his problems, for his inheritance, which includes a rather unique mansion-- albeit in a remote area-- insures his solvency for the rest of his life.  But upon entering this singular house left behind by Cyrus, Arthur's life and that of his family is about to change in ways he could never dream of, none of which are not good, and all of which have to do with something Cyrus left in the basement.  And just like that, with the flapping of the butterfly's wings in China, a tidal wave is about to hit shore a continent away.Working from a screenplay by Neal Stevens and Richard D'Ovidio (from a story by Robb White), Beck has crafted and delivered a less than compelling film that has it's moments, but relies primarily on the special F/X for the impact it's attempting to make.  The film has it's moments, but to put it into perspective using the one hundred floor `Haunted House Spooky/scary' scale, it checks in on about the fiftieth floor, just a couple below `The House on Haunted Hill' (1999).  `The Others' (2001), meanwhile, currently occupies the penthouse, while the dreary `The Haunting' (1999) is, and will forever languish in, the basement.  The ghosts here are disconcertingly gruesome, though some of them tend to be a bit over the top; a few of them appear to be the product of a mad designer who should have had his sketching crayon taken away from him sooner.  A few less spikes, bolts, piercings and protrusions would have made them more convincing; as it is, they don't have enough `humanity' left in them to be credible as formerly living beings.  It's a good case for the `less is more' theory, in fact.  The real interest in this film is the house itself, which is perhaps the most unique design in the annals of the cinematic haunted house.  With it's glass walls filled with Latin inscriptions and it's ability to alter itself into a claustrophobic maze at will, it is actually more jarring and shocking than the otherworldly denizens it houses in it's subterranean recesses.  Arguably, it can be said that the house is, in point of fact, the star of the movie.  And Beck does use it to good effect.The real star, however, is Tony Shalhoub, as the unwary nephew, Arthur. Shalhoub has emerged as one of the finest character actors in the business, and even if the character he is playing is a rather straight forward, `normal' every day type, which is basically who Arthur is, nobody does it better.  What makes him so good is that he has the ability and talent to make whatever character he's portraying believable and convincing, whether it's an alien in `Men In Black,' a street prophet in `Life or Something Like it' or your run-of-the-mill generic math teacher.  He works from the inside out, which gives his characters depth and nuance; deep down Shalhoub IS that person, before he-- whomever it is-- ever makes a physical appearance.  And THAT is good acting.After Shalhoub, however, there's nothing much of note here, performance wise.  Abraham does a good turn as Cyrus, but his role is little more than a glorified cameo with little room for character development, and even though what he does is good, there's no getting around the fact that early on his Cyrus falls into stereotype.  Matthew Lillard does a quirky turn as Dennis, but looking at him for any length of time can be distracting; Shannon Elizabeth, as Arthur's daughter, Kathy, is too pert and perky to be effective, with a perpetual smile that would be more fitting in a toothpaste commercial or `Starship Troopers 2' than here; Embeth Davidtz (Kalina) is simply underused; young Alec Roberts (Bobby) is annoying; and making her acting debut, Rah Digga (better known as the ""female"" MC and only woman in Busta Rhymes' renowned Flip Mode Squad), as the nanny, Maggie, leaves a lot to be desired, which pretty much sums up `Thir13en Ghosts.'  This one, as they say, is close-- but no cigar.  There's just not enough magic.  5/10.",Thir13en Ghosts

70,CharltonBoy,A Modern day Hellraiser,7,12 November 2002,I was expecting the usual teen slasher type horror with 13 Ghost and a lot of this film is reminiscent of many horror movies but it also has that little bit extra that makes it above average. The story is nothing special as is the acting but the concept of the mechanical house haunted by 13 ghosts that all are horrific in their own different way is very good and it does remind me very much of Hellraiser. The ending is poor as is the begining but what we see in the middle of the film is good and  is even scary at times.

71,juliankennedy23,"Nice house, too bad about the people.",4,12 February 2005,"13 Ghosts 2001: 4/10 Fantastic set design and creative character (ghost) make-up effects cannot save this overloud, over edited mess.The cast ranges from the where is my paycheck crowd (F. Murray Abraham and Tony Shalhoub), disappointedly clothed (Shannon Elizabeth about 10 years too old to play virginal teenagers and cute Embeth Davidtz), and remarkably irritating (Alec Roberts playing a little boy you wish would just die. Matthew Lillard in his the most irritating role ever and that's saying something. And female rapper Rah Digger channeling every offensive black maid stereotype and inventing a few new ones. Come to think of it a black maid is so 1960's anyone who is anyone has a European au pair.) Yes the good old black maid stereotype, Digger is apparently channeling Beulah from Party at Horror beach She exclaims she ain't washing no windows (It's an all glass house) and for you film historians out there she doesn't birth no babies either. The rest of the comic relief is at about the same level. With Lillard practically imploding on his performance in a mad dog style that has to be seen to be believed and underutilized Davidtz stuck with the laughable task of playing an environmentalist ghost protector. On the plus side the ghosts are very well done however they don't have nearly enough screen time and look a bit like the cast of Hellraiser is moonlighting. The set design with a giant glass house with beautiful Latin writings on the walls is where the movie shines. I guess in a haunted house movie the ghosts and house are the real stars. It's simply a shame they had to include the plot and characters. Truth be told it would have been a better movie without them.",Thir13en Ghosts

This movie is pretty much creativity unleashed with a lot of unneceassary gore and nudity tossed in with a lot of overdone special effects. The junkyard scenes are pretty much a rip-off of the Nightmare on Elm Street movies. The script and plot are over the top, but it is bogged down with a lot of phony and nonsensical occult mishmash.The paranormal idiosyncrasies in this movie are amusing, but no where as scary as the anxiety of a real haunted house. The ghosts are interesting but farfetched writer's fantasies, but at least the house is an interesting architectual curiosity to make it one of the stars. Tony Shalhoub shines in his first appearance as a dad as Matthew Lillard gets his ghost training in before doing Shaggy in Scooby Doo. Shannon Elizabeth plays straight since her irritating role in Scary Movie one. In short, I like this movie, but I could have done a lot more scary with half the budget.",Thir13en Ghosts

The walls are made of glass and there are many great rooms and fabulous work done in the house.

It had a 20 million dollar budget so frankly it just sucks. The animation was terrible as well as the acting. The story line was stupid and all over the place.This movie is about a man who has a very rich uncle. The rich uncle dies and leave the man everything including a very strange mansion.

75,Movie-12,"Not enough scares, but a great visual look. ** (out of four)",5,31 October 2001,"13 GHOSTS / (2001) ** (out of four)I'll admit that I'm a sucker for haunted house movies. I forbid a guilty pleasure watching miscellaneous characters roam through dark, creepy hallways and walk through ominous corridors as vicious evil lurks behind closed doors, and observes from the shadows. The characters' fates are never in question, but it's a lot of fun watching them meet a gruesome demise.I enjoy this kind of film so much that I even found a soft spot for ""House on Haunted Hill"" and ""The Haunting,"" 1999's critically mauled haunted house movies. Naturally, I was eagerly awaiting the arrival of ""13 Ghosts,"" a state-of-the-art remake of the 1960's William Castle horror film of the same name. Warner Bros. released it the weekend before Halloween, and they couldn't have picked a better time. In 1999, ""House on Haunted Hill"" broke box-office records when released on the same weekend. 
All that aside, ""13 Ghosts"" will be a major disappointment to even diehard fans of the genre like myself. The film perspires with potential scares, complete with an intriguing premise, a tantalizing trailer, and an astonishing visual appearance. Unfortunately, the screenplay drops dead on arrival, filled with enough recycled moments and cluncky, one-dimensional dialogue to wake the dead. This movie is a wasted opportunity.
The film stars Tony Shalhoub as Arthur Kriticos, the widowed father of two children, Kathy (""American Pie's"" Shannon Elizabeth) and preteen Bobby (Alec Roberts). As the movie opens, the family faces tragedy as a fire burns down their house and kills Arthur's wife. They are left with nothing.
Nothing, that is, until Arthur inherits a unique house from his late, eccentric uncle Cyrus (F. Murray Abraham). The house is a masterpiece of modern architecture. Made entirely of glass and steel, antique treasures fill the rooms, strange machines, gears, cranks, and big glass chambers position themselves throughout. The family can't believe their good fortune, nor do they believe a mysterious character when he tries to explain the house is haunted. Like most haunted house movies, ""13 Ghosts"" works best when the characters explore the mansion completely unaware of the danger that awaits. Too bad this kind of sequence only inhabits but a few moments of the already short movie. With a running time of only 88 minutes, everything feels rushed, contrived, and astonishingly brief. Talk about rushing things. This movie pounds us with moments of loud noises and violent encounters. If the film would have developed an ominous atmosphere and obeyed the rules of haunted house movies, then the rapid-fire violence may have worked to some extent. But we just don't get that here.
Prosthetics specialists must have had a field day with this movie. Contrary to the title, there are twelve different ghosts in this movie. We admire the makeup and special effects department when we see the masterfully crafted ghouls. But when we do see them, it's through quick, brief flashes. The editing is choppy, brief and visually incoherent. It's like director Steve Beck wanted the ghosts to be special effects instead of a solid physical presence. Big mistake.   ""13 Ghosts"" will not win any awards for composition. The  overuse of slow-motion photography quickly becomes a nuisance. The editing, photography tricks, and computer animation techniques often feel misplaced. However, even if the film was masterfully constructed, a good technical department does not make up for the lack of a sufficient script.But no! ""13 Ghosts"" is too concerned with pleasing audiences, and providing us with comic relief. Relief from what? The film does squeeze in a few decent horrific moments, but for the most part it is not that scary. If the film was 88 minutes of pure, edge-of-your-seat suspense and horror, I can see why comic relief might be in order. But with ""13 Ghosts,"" we deserve more than comic relief, we deserve a better movie entirely.",Thir13en Ghosts

I found myself questioning what would happen next even though I had seen it when it first came out. Also the claustrophobic trapped factor is something that heightens the fear factor. Some horror movies are pathetic in the fact that all the victims need to do is walk out the front door but no that would be too easy.It's awesome seeing a cast that have developed so much over time and have just gotten better with age. Also the ghosts feel like characters themselves and it would be great to find out more about them. They seem so unique and I would love to know what drives them and their motives behind what they do. That may have made the movie comical and lacking fear though, kind of like Eddie Murphy's The Haunted Mansion.

I usually love these kind of haunted house, horror, ghost movies and if people like these kind of movies too, then they might not mind this movie, but there are definitely better ones out there. One of the main reasons as to why I am saying this is because the cast in this movie are SO awful and unbelievable, it makes the movie hard to enjoy and take even a little bit seriously.The worst performances definitely come from Shannon Elizabeth, (Joint with Salma Hayek for first place as one of the worst actress' around.) Tony Shalhoub, F. Murray Abraham, Alec Roberts and Rah Digga who all NEVER give good performances anyway, so I didn't expect much of them. Couldn't they of had better actors to play there parts. Matthew Lillard suits his role as the nutty Dennis, even though he's always really playing this kind of role in many of his movies. There's nothing wrong with a little humour in horror movies, but sometimes it a movie like this just doesn't need it....

78,Antagonisten,Awful,2,27 December 2005,"Modern horror movies seem to be stuck in some sort of crappy evil circle. They all try the same horror effects and they all fail as miserably. I haven't even begun to jump in my chair when going to the movies for years now, and ""Thir13en Ghosts"" is even worse than most of it's kind.The movie begins with a nice big plot-hole as well as inexplicable irrationality from the main characters. Not a good start, even though i can't say my expectations were very high to begin with when it came to plot and coherence. Tony Shalhoub plays a man who is apparently poor but still manages to have a house-keeper (the house keeper being the extremely out-of-place rapper Rah Digga). He happens to be the nephew of a rich collector though and is given a huge inheritance. Including a house that looks like a big transparent glass cube with a machinery inside it. None of the characters forming this little family stop to think ""maybe this is not a house made to live in, which would explain the machinery looking almost like the insides of a clock"". Instead they all amble in immediately losing track of each other.Then the horror begins. And i don't mean that in the ""good"" sense where you'd actually be scared, rather in the ""bad"" way where the horror lies in how awful the movie is. Director Steve Beck has one idea on how to scare people and one idea only: use flashing images. And so we have an hour or so of epilepsy-inducing flashes in which people in makeup thrash about like spastics. Like that was not enough, of course these ghosts can not be seen without special glasses on. So everybody runs around with these huge 1980's style goggles with which they can see the flashing images of spastic ghosts.And the resolution finally, without giving anything away, is as disappointing as expected. And i finish watching this movie more depressed and annoyed than scared. There has to be people with more talent than Steven Beck (whoever he is?) that could make horror movies instead of him. Because this is not watchable. Reasonably gifted actors are wasted completely in these 90 minutes of crap.

The family is ecstatic when they are informed by a creepy lawyer that they have inherited Cyrus's grandiose estate and immediately make the several hour drive out into the remote countryside to see their new home. The house, made entirely of sound and shatterproof glass, seems like a dream come true...at least until Dennis Rafkin, a tweaky psychic filled with dire warnings, shows up and passionately advises Arthur to get out and take his family with him. But it's too late. The house is actually a giant machine designed by Satan and built by Cyrus for the sole purpose of opening the ""Eye Of Hell"" and it seals itself shut, trapping everyone inside and releasing the 13 ghosts imprisoned in the basement from their enspelled holding cells. The ghosts are now onthe hunt, determined to kill anyone who crosses their path.First, the good points, few though they may be. The ghosts are pretty cool looking. The Jackal in particular is impressive with his steel cage headgear and his rabid temper. The girl ghost too was sufficiently freaky looking. The house itself is a cool set, filled with some really nifty looking mechanisms. And that's where the cool stuff ends.The performances in this film are excruciatingly bad, and the script is so abysmally idiotic that it hurt. Matthew Lillard is by far the only character I gave a damn about; his twitchy, geeky psychic was oddly likable. And poor F. Murray Abraham...he really deserves better roles than this. The rest of the family is so freaking annoying that I was looking forward to seeing them all get killed in many painful and horrible ways. After five full minutes of listening to the cast scream: ""Bobby!"" over and over, I developed a pounding migraine. The gore is minimal but halfway decent when it appears, i.e. the ""split"" scene. But the film gets really tedious really fast as characters spend much of their time running down glass corridors, screaming their heads off and stupidly pausing to look through their spectral welding glasses at the ghosts, who are given ample time to close the distance between themselves and their brain dead victims.A very bad, stupid, lifeless movie.",Thir13en Ghosts

All we saw was that an ordinary family (very much like the Poltergeistfamily!) were in some house that gathers ghosts and that it was all build up like a labyrinth...and to make it even more complicated (well in a way) they only could see the ghosts when they were wearing special glasses. After having seen Ghost Ship as well, I assume it must be Steve Beck's goal to become the newest wunderkind in horrormovies.

And it turns out that the house is the real star of this movie, although after a while you get the idea it is a flat and not the multi-level structure they try to suggest.As is (unfortunately) becoming more common, Shannon Elizabeth is becoming highly over-dressed in her roles, although one voluptuous babe makes several nude appearances as a ghost with her tits slashed!Anyone under the age of 13 that has not rented any horror videos, might find this movie interesting.",Thir13en Ghosts

Initially I thought this would be a thrilling film, but when I say initially I think of the moment when I read the title and I saw the poster. I believe it would have been better if that had been all there was to say to it. Unfortunately, it isn't.SpoilersThis film is about uncle Cyrus, who catches ghosts so that he can become the strongest man on earth. All he has to do is catch 12, and get someone to sacrifice himself so that he could have 13, the amount needed for his demonic plan. After what seems to be his death, his family, with which he had little contact, gets his strange villa, made solely out of glass. And so, the ""horror"" trip begins.We get to see people cut in two, ghosts who do not really inspire fright, and generally a lot of blood. Blood and violence. That's all there is to this movie. A totally childish and idiotic plot can not become a good movie with the best actors on this world. But just think what you can get if you have this plot and a bunch of pathetic actors! Oh my... No thrills, no chills, no comedy, no horror. No nothing! I wonder how anyone can put together such a movie. There just isn't anything original worth remembering here.With all my sympathy towards Tony Shalhoub, I can quite easily define this as the worst movie of 2002, and maybe even one of the worst movies ever. Not even the interesting architecture of the house can save the sour effect of the rest of the film. I do not recommend it to anyone, except those who don't have anything better to do than watch this pathetic ""piece of art"". It's not even worth a four: 3.5/10",Thir13en Ghosts

This movie is about an eccentric millionaire who gets some people to go to a strange, unique building which soon seals itself, trapping the guests with some angry... you get the point. This movie is the perfect example of going back to the well, but it must've gone dry because ""Haunted Hill"" is much, much better than ""13 Ghosts"" which is very sucky.Like ""Hill"", this flick has one token actor from a cult horror film (In ""Hill"" it was Jeffrey Combs from ""Re-Animator"", here it's Embeth Davidtz from ""Army of Darkness""). The ghosts look excellent (KNB kicks ass!), the sets are neat, and there is one good death scene, but that's about all to recommend here. The plot is over-elaborate and confused, making up some rules and then breaking them later. The characters are lame (you know you're in trouble when the most likable person in your movie is Matthew Lillard), there's a stereotypical black chick (""Trapped in this house with these crazy white people!""- BTW, how can this debt-ridden family afford a live-in nanny anyway?), and it features one of the worst kid actors ever (Don't they audition these kids? Doesn't anyone notice they're horrible? I guess this is the ""Jake Lloyd Syndrome"").  Except for the lawyer death, no one dies until the very end, which packs in a lot of twists and crap, but by this time you won't care what's going on.

On the whole should I of watched 13 Ghosts back then , I would have walked out throughly impressed with it but now that I have grown up it just seems like a crap remake for teen slasher audiences. Now don't get me wrong it was not short of entertainment , it just did not impress greatly either. I mean of course they had Ghosts and entertaining kill moments but then again nothing really scary , the special affects were good and the story moved at a good pace with a good twist. The acting was not the greatest but certainly good on a B movie level and the special affects were good with a few daunting moments. However at the end of the Day 13 Ghosts is just well a dumb and trust me sometimes very dumb teen summer movie. There are moments were people just seem to come out from no where and seem to have a logic for what is going on and the rest are just too gullible to believe ! To conclude 13 Ghosts is not a complete waste of time , its worth a look at if you are bored and don't want to watch anything heavy and just pass the time, I mean its not a complete waste of time just leave your brain behind after all it had a few violent scenes and some black humour of the Scream era to keep me watching.THIR13TEEN GHOSTS - 6.7 out of 10TERROR HAS MULTIPILED...",Thir13en Ghosts

It fails to establish an emotional connection with the main characters, and the ghosts are shown as evil, rather than victims.So , there is little connection with them either.

102,RhapsodyReviews,Great B-Horror Film.,7,21 October 2019,"Review:
'Thir13en Ghosts' is a supernatural-horror film directed by Steve Beck. It is a remake of the 1960 film 13 Ghosts by William Castle.
While this might not be the best executed movie, it is definitely original and entertaining. It doesn't have a real story, but there are some real scares. Since it is about ghosts those things can turn up anytime and anywhere.
The movie centers around a dad Arthur (Tony Shalhboub), his daughter Kathy (Shannon Elizabeth), son Bobby (Alec Roberts) and nanny Maggie (Rah Digga) who inherits a strange house, created by their uncle Cyrus (F. Murray Abraham). We learn that Cyrus was a ghost hunter and that twelve ghosts are locked in the basement of the house he leaves Arthur and his family. When the ghosts are unleashed, they have to save themselves.
I personally think everybody in this movie, aside from Matthew Lillard was top notch. Not to say that Lillard is bad in the movie, he was just not on the same level as the other actors in the film. He played his character of the paranormal psychic well enough for me to believe it, but not enough to be invested, and I really enjoy his work.
I find this to be a very entertaining movie. Good special effects, good acting, lots of action, neat props and mechanicals, and some unique ghosts make this a lot of fun. The film does a a lot of clichés when it comes to both the horror an action genre, which does make the execution of the movie feel a bit sloppy at times.
Overall, this movie is fun. That's the best thing I can say about it, it's not a scary horror movie, it can make you jump at times, but I think anybody can watch this movie in the pitch black and not be scared. I can recommend it based on the entertainment value alone.

103,ryan_kuhn,"""I'm getting my ass out of the big glass house!""",2,13 February 2005,"With some movies, it's obvious that the producers put most of the budget in the special effects, others put into landing big stars, a few actually spend money to come up with a worthwhile story (though not as many as there should be). With 13 Ghosts, it appears the lionshare of the money was spent on building an incredible set, and then that's as far as it goes. This film proves that sometimes, bad things happen to good people. Shannon Elizabeth was hot, she was THE actress in 2001 after the success of the American Pie movies, and Tony Shalhoub won an Emmy for his acting in Monk, but this movie is a blemish on their resumes. The story has something to do with a house that may or may not be a portal to Hell or something to do with Satan that comes into possession of Shalhoub and his family, his daughter is Elizabeth. The movie is a series of scary chases with ghosts, a melodrama with a dead mother, and Shining-like gross nudity. The plot and the characters will make you wish you were elsewhere, possibly the house that is the center to the story. It is really neat looking, a wonderful looking set, a house filled with glass doors that separate wide open rooms into smaller compartments, it is the lone success of the movie. By the end, the film is boring and I didn't really care what happened to everyone. This reminds me of what has happened to the horror genre, nowadays it's not scary to build up to suspense, but rather film makers thinks scary is non-stop blood and gore, lots of quick hits of action. Gone are the days of Hitchcock where terror came from surprises after some slow pacing setting up the payoff. Why? I guess people don't have the attention span to stay with such films, but after seeing 13 Ghosts, I long for something like that.",Thir13en Ghosts

I get the obvious plot. Still. This is clearly no house, funky bathroom notwithstanding, and I'd think the first reaction from the family, after the awe, would be: it's basically an unlivable sort of machine (which point was plain from the start, as most foyers/living rooms don't have spinning floor centers). Then, I can't fathom the role(s) of Psychic Glasses Dude, who is oddly surprised to encounter the ghosts he helped round up. Worse is the unclear 'resolution' regarding Shaloub's sacrifice. As has been said hereabouts, what's the point of the machine kicking into high gear when the guy waiting to benefit from it is dead? Biggest mix-up: are these ghosts purely evil or merely due parole to some afterlife? There is no agenda of actual ghostly malice toward the family, since we never quite understand what the hell the ghosts are after, except freedom. Which ties into the strange addition of Shaloub's wife. ONE ghost gets to be non-psychotic/horrible? This relates to the bizarre factor that the wicked Cyrus would somehow not anticipate that his humane nephew would screw everything up out of love. Also noted here: how does a broke math teacher afford a nanny, even if she supplies the sassy, Eve Arden element? The movie is actually watchable because care went into the ghosts.

117,kismit,A lot better than I expected,7,26 January 2002,It doesn't rely on too much splatter and it doesn't try to startle you out of your seat every two minutes so that immediately makes it better than the average horror flick. The ghosts were unusual enough to be memorable and there was not a lot of familiarity to the plot. This was very nearly an excellent film with a solid cast and very good effects. Five or ten more minutes of scary interaction between the ghosts and the children(if you can call Shannon Elizabeth a child) would have made the movie much better. I call it a near miss which is as good as most horror fils can aspire to.,Thir13en Ghosts
118,johnm_001,Stupid But Fun!,5,22 April 2002,"One of the dumbest screenplays, ever written, with almost nothing happening, that could remotely pass for plausible.  However, the film is a lot of fun, and a good updating of the equally silly William Castle original, and infinitely better than their remake of ""House On Haunted Hill, which was an utter bore.  First-rate special effects, scenic design, make-up, and good enveloping surround sound, make this film a must for horror-film fans.  Tony Shalhoub and Matthew Lillard are fine, and Rah Digga, utters one of the funniest (and dumbest) lines, I've ever heard in a film (while looking at the lawyer).

This one THINKS it's being great...it isn't. Acting wise you have Tony Shalhoub...then everyone else. The house design may be brilliant but it only does one thing; keep any semblance of a story or character development from happening. This movie is about the house...not the family who inherits it, and that's the BIG mistake. Once agaom a director thinks MORE blood means scarier moments...MORE of 'I'll show the audience everything' mean more fright. W R O N G! A thousand times wrong. Every human has the potential to create more fear with their imagination than with any 'in your face' effects. This seems to have been forgotten by all but a few directors AND, unfortunately, embraced by people who WANT everything done for them, thereby dulling their imaginations...possible destroying them forever.",Thir13en Ghosts
120,james362001,This version is too flashy and subliminal with the ghosts.,7,13 July 2002,"Not at all like the original 1960 version, which was creepy and had some imagination to it. The special glasses are still in the remake, but in 1960 the glasses were a gimmick for theatre audiences to enjoy similar to 3-D glasses. They had to put on the special glasses to see the ghosts in the film.  The 2001 version is too flashy and subliminal with the ghosts.  Why is it that the ghosts these years always seem to look like Night Of The Living Dead?  This version will not be a classic like the original.  What I will remember is Tony Shalhoub as the father, Alec Roberts as the son and Kathryn Anderson as the mother.  Good acting and performance by all three.",Thir13en Ghosts
121,tenten76,Glossy garbage.,7,4 October 2002,"I've seen the original, and it seems they stuck pretty close to the plot - which is not always a good thing, because I just couldn't get over the preposterous notion that any family (let alone a penniless one) would employ such a lazy bitch nanny.  Rah Diggah's character was completely unlikeable, and so obviously a PC addition, it hurt to watch.Matt Lilliard manages to act more manic than ever before (for someone who only acts that way anyway, it still seemed overdone), and his character also has no redeeming features.Shannon Elizabeth doesn't have much to do but look pretty, including a cheap 'T-shirt' ripping moment which stops short of any worth.. ..and her younger brother is as annoying as all brat kids, but mercifully gets kidnapped before too long; doesn't reappear until the end; and doesn't personally save the day with the aid of some toy, as in many movies.Unfortunately, the alternative is an equally shoddy ending.Tony Shalhoub (in his worst career choice ever) struggles against the overwhelming tide of the script, and Embeth Davidtz (although she's beautiful), well, underwhelms in a terrible role.The house is actually pretty nice, from a design point of view, and reminds me of other 'infernal machines', like the box in Hellraiser, but the core of the machine is a case of CGI-over-substance.. ..and I thought the ghosts were well designed & realised, but used in too random a fashion (and the rapid editing throughout the movie really sucks). Afterwards, I watched the separate ghosts' profiles (on the DVD), and I think this would have helped if it was in the actual movie.Overall, the movie sucked big-time, the CGI looked kinda cheap occasionally (not always, some effects were quite good), and for this kind of movie, not nearly enough death.  If you edit out a few seconds here and there, and throw in a labrador, you could slap a Disney label on it.I would only watch this mistake again if it were re-edited so that the kid and the nanny get killed at the first opportunity.  Perhaps the other reason I found this rubbish quite so offensive was because the classy opening credits promised so much more, and the premise could have actually been quite good.Checking the credits of the Director and Writers, I should have avoided this movie anyway.  The biggest 'positive' of Thirteen Ghosts is that it may encourage you to create your own movies and screenplays, because if this trash can get made, what's stopping you?",Thir13en Ghosts

I've seen this movie several times, and would still watch it again. The visual effects and different make-up/outfits for the ghosts were absolutely stunning. The camera work was done in a very different style - a little bad, but at least different!
Who says this isn't scary?? I was scared (and that's rare).. it's a little bit of that 'jump-scare' tactic, mixed in with the, 'who's next' scary!

123,23skidoo-4,The house is the star,7,11 August 2002,"Thir13en Ghosts is a cool movie, of that there is no doubt. The house is one of the most unique sets ever devised for a film, though the idea of a house changing its interior configuration is not new (I haven't seen the original Thirteen Ghosts, but I know The Avengers TV series and later movie remake made use of the same gimmick).Unfortunately, save for a few really gory moments (I mean REALLY gory -- if you have a weak stomach I'd hold off on the popcorn), I didn't really find the film that scary. The initial revelation of the ghosts via a form of 3-D glasses is effective, but for some reason I didn't find myself jumping out of my chair. Part of that is due to the rapid-fire editing, which I found rather distracting on the small screen (it might have played better in the theatre). The cast is excellent for the most part, led by Tony Shaloub as the nervous father and Shannon Elizabeth as his sexy daughter. F. Murray Abraham makes a fun villain. I did not like the nanny character, played by a rap singer-turned-actress, who I felt came off as stereotypical and a little offensive.The storyline is pretty good, with enough twists and turns and switches (pardon the pun) to keep you interested. And once again, the movie's set piece, the glass house, is a marvel of architecture. Lined with walls covered in Latin, and at times resembling an Escher painting, the set is a fun house ride gone mad.The big disappointment for me is in the lack of character development for the ghosts. True, their main job is to scare the heck out of the heroes and cause a few bloody deaths along the way, but as the DVD release reveals, each ghost has a fascinating backstory that I feel should have been included in the main movie. (Actually, the whole concept of Thirteen Ghosts -- the capture of troubled spirits -- would actually make a cool TV series, a sort of very dark take on Twilight Zone).I also felt the movie felt a bit too much like The Haunting and House on Haunted Hill. But then, if you include other architecture-based horror flicks like the House series, I suppose it does create a sub-genre and there's only so many original ideas to go around.",Thir13en Ghosts

126,NicolasCostoglou,"A confused, but charming old man is telling a ghost story...i think...",6,12 January 2017,"This is the rare instant of a movie, where i have actually no idea what they were trying to do...This is the directorial debut of Steve Beck known for his incredible effect work on great movies like ""Indiana Jones the last Crusade"", ""The Abyss"", and ""Hunt for Red October"". And it shows, because the production-design, the special- and make- up-effects (by the legends Howard Berger, Gregory Nicotero and Robert Kurzman) all look very good. BUT this is also the reason that this movie never feels like a horror movie, because there is no atmosphere, because of the lighting in particular, which is very bright, so you can see all the work put on screen. I understand why they did that, but that's one of the reasons this movie never feels scary, it looks actually more like a Disney family movie with out-of-nowhere gore and violence...The actors all do their job fairly well, but the emotional center (and strongest point) of this film is Tony Shalhoub. His performance is the main reason the key-scenes of this film actually work.However, the real main protagonist of the movie is definitely the haunted house. It's a kinda steam-punk-puzzle-clockwork and the main setting for everything that happens. It's not particularly scary to be in that kind of environment, and especially things like (Hellraiser-) ghosts feel very much out of place, but like i said, the make-up is very well done, it just feels wasted.The soundtrack is also very bland and i can't remember one single note to be honest...So...this isn't a horror-, sci-fi-, comedy-, family-, or mystery movie...well at least it doesn't feel like on of these genres.But everything's solid, nothings really bad, just unfocused and confused, like a child in a history lesson.The only reason it works, is because of the chemistry between our protagonist and his family. The movie actually introduces them in the most effective scene in the whole film, while showing the opening credits, this little 360- shot tells us everything we need to know perfectly and emotional powerful. If you don't feel like watching this, the intro and opening credits are two scenes you should watch nevertheless.A confused and unfocused film, with some solid entertaining value and a strong emotional core...",Thir13en Ghosts
127,H_Spengler,Wow! What an enormous waste of time!,2,12 November 2008,"I got really bored today and this movie was on. Having never seen it before, I cautiously tuned in.This was a horrible movie and I have a horrible headache after watching it. Nothing about it is engaging, frightening or suspenseful. Every single word of spoken dialog sounds like someone repeating cue cards. It was my impression that after the fire that killed his wife, Arthur and his family were poor, barely making ends meet. How is it they have a nanny? And why? Is the daughter not old enough to keep an eye on that bratty son? Isn't he a teacher? Doesn't that kid go to school? Why wouldn't Arthur be back to watch him seeing that he generally would get out of school at the same time? You see, we haven't even gotten to the ghosts yet and already i'm rolling my eyes. The ""nanny"" is your typical token minority. ""She's sassy!"" No, she's boring and unnecessary and had nothing to do with the rest of the story.Anyhow (sigh), they inherit this weird house from an equally weird relative, upon checking it out, there's gears and glass everywhere. No one seems to think there's anything strange about this. All hell breaks loose when the ghosts are set free, and start to come after the living. Honestly, they're grotesque, but not the least bit scary...nothing they did shocked or frightened me. Unfortunately this type of mediocrity is what makes up the entire movie. I can't even blame the actors, it's the fault of bad writing and even worse directing.What throws me off is that a good chunk of the actors have all been in GREAT movies and have the ability to morph into a role when properly led. F. Murray Abraham (Amadeus), Tony Shalhoub (Men in Black, Monk), Embeth Davidtz (Army of Darkness, Fracture), Matthew Lillard (SLC Punk, Scream), Shannon Elizabeth (Tomcats (yes even THAT was better than this movie)). It's like decades of wasted talent! This is an utter waste of time with no redemption what so ever. You want to see a scary movie that will really disturb you? Try ""The Hills Have Eyes"", or ""Silent Hill"". I give this a ""2"" because of my respect for these actors and seeing them in much better roles, and because of the make up and prosthetics done on the ghosts which actually looked real (not scary, just real).",Thir13en Ghosts

But, should you watch this movie for the plot and the story, you won't be disappointed. The characters are well build, and the story line in itself is interesting. Some twists and turns are also included, and very gory though not scary ghosts are added as bonus.  Many of the others user comments mention how great the house was, and that is true.  However, I felt that you never knew where anyone was, and therefore you never really knew if they were in danger or how far away from safety they were.  Every corridor was the same, creating a visual boredom during the middle of the film.  What let the film down more then lack of suspense was the ending.

It isn't high art or even necessarily a good movie, but Thirteen Ghosts does enough to deserve recognition. First, the writing is mildly interesting. Not much is fleshed out and the ending goes off the rails, but the premise of captured ghosts in a house of enchanted walls is unique. Meanwhile, although the acting is weighed down by the supporting cast (especially the kid), Tony Shalhoub and Matthew Lillard both elevate the material. Shalhoub is simply a supervisor actor and Lillard brings the ideal amount of ham.Furthermore, Thirteen Ghosts is surprisingly proficient from a technical perspective. The editing during ghost attacks is chaotic and frightening. The ghosts have an echoing sound that feels distant and melancholy. However, the production design stands out at the highlight of the film. Because the ghosts have a distinct discolored look and the aesthetic of the house is modernized industrialism that's almost steampunk. Throw in the proficient camera work and effects, and the result is a movie that isn't half bad. Thirteen Ghosts certainly has faults but, overall, it is a reasonable piece of schlock.Writing: 5/10

This is without doubt the worst film I have seen this year, to be honest I would go as far as to say it could make it into my top ten worst films of all time. About as suspenseful as Scary Movie and as chilling as Casper, Thir13en Ghosts (which genius thought of spelling the title like that?) deserves absolutely no credit whatsoever. I have never seen such appalling acting in a theatrical release, the cast shares the combined talent of a porn star. NOTE - Some minor spoilers may pop up here and there from now on. Shannon Elizabeth deserves an extra mention for such superior dialogue like ""This place is awesome!... It's beautiful!... My own bathroom!"" and sure enough ""It's beautiful!"" again. For the love of God Shannon, take some bloody acting lessons!!! More fab dialogue comes from the Dad, who upon seeing a book on a table exclaims with as much enthusiasm as Steven Seagal ""What a wealth of knowledge"". The virtually non-existent plot devotes no time to character development or back stories for the main characters so we feel little emotion for them, who incidentally seem to be so unbelievably stupid you end up rooting for the ghosts instead. This brings me to my next point - the make up. Again, this fails on every level. Most of the ghosts look like bad actors in those cheap rubber horror masks you buy at the hardware store for £5 with plastic knives and spikes sticking out of them. The most prominently featured one - a naked girl - simply has a truckload of black eye shadow plastered around her eyes and two huge 'gashes' over her breasts, which actually looks like two lines of red lipstick. There is no logic to the film, no real plot, in fact the whole thing made me ask myself ""What in God's name was the point of this?"". I can tell that I'm losing it now, the thought of last Friday night just makes my skin crawl.Despite the film being horrifically bad in general, it had a few good aspects. For example - SPOILER - the awesome dissection of the salesman. Now that's good 'ol fashioned gore!!! Special mention should also go to the set, which is actually fantastic.

This movies only plus would be the good ghost makup because that is really really good. THE BIG minus in exactly that same department would be that you hardly ever really get to see the ghosts. Only in very short shots and they DON'T REALLY play a big part in the movie! What plays the bigger part is the labyrinth this movie is about. The ghosts are kinda trapped in it and they get the poeple in there a good scare. That's about it. So what you see in this movie is some kinda intro, then the people get trapped in the labryrinth, then they get scared - run around (or climb arround) screaming constantly for about an hour and then comes the conclusion which really really sucks! So the movie is basically culminating from the 30 minute mark onwards.So, my 3 of 10 points go to the ghost makup only!!!!! I must say this: Unless you are a makup fanatic or makup artist or special FX person - don't watch this!

First, the good points. The ghosts were, mostly, cool. (With the exception of that STUPID large baby ghost.) The first ""ghost-hunting"" scene was also pretty cool, as was the death of the lawyer. I also enjoyed the (short) scene in which a character was trapped in a small room with a killer-ghost that he can't see. And Tony Shalhoub did a decent acting job in the lead role.Other than that, though, this film was pretty lame. The most annoying thing in the film to me was the irritating black-stereotype (I truly don't mean this offensively, of course) unfunny ""comic relief"". Anytime she was around, I was pretty much rooting for the ghosts. The kids were annoying too, especially Shannon Elizabeth's character. Although I think Shannon Elizabeth is cute and even a good actress, her character in this movie acted like she was maybe 6 years old. It was distracting and aggravating.The dialogue was lame and the movie was predictable. As the Arrow also pointed out, the first plot twist of the movie was easy to see coming a mile away. The second one was not, but only because it was pointless and stupid. The ending was largely unsatisfying to me, but the characters annoyed me so much by then that I doubt any ending would have worked for me at all.There also weren't enough gory deaths in this movie. I mean, come on, it's what you expect from a haunted house movie. The movie could've done with more of the cheesy fun from THE HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL. I would definitely recommend renting THAT film rather then checking out this one.4/10",Thir13en Ghosts

Mostly because this looked like a great movie, & I was hoping that it would be much better than most horror movies nowadays. Plus when I heard that SFX masters 'KNB' were doing the effects, it had to be great. Disappointed? Not on bit! This was a great movie! The actors were good, the SFX were outstanding, & I had a blast from start to finish. When Arthur finds out his Uncle dies, he receives his life's work...an amazing house. Too good to be true...? You bet. Arthur, his 2 kids, & housekeeper get more than they reckon with...actually 12 extra things. This movie moves nonstop, which makes it alot of fun.

153,steve-862,It could have been so good.,4,16 April 2002,"When I saw this film I was looking forward to it immensely.  I am a big fan of horror and in particular supernatural films that have a number of people trapped in some situation where they are very afraid.  When I did see this I was impressed with the beginning of the film but after that Hollywood gloss took over and turned it into an enjoyable but 'scare free' film. 
The effects are excellent and the plot full, too full.  If I was trapped in a house with a number of ghosts, most of whom were malicious when they were alive I would be freaked out.  The characters in the film were not freaked out and at times the twists of the plot took control of the film and became more important than the actual frightning parts.   The element that was missing was the fear factor, the unknown hideous thing that you can't face and don't want to believe in or know anything about, our characters displayed too much logical thought in this film. 
I'm sorry but this was a thumbs down movie for me.  I consider myself to be quite a horror film fanatic and I would have to say that Hollywood have absolutely lost the ability to make movies that scare you and disturb you.",Thir13en Ghosts

155,GenK1981,Great remake with fantastic effects!,7,19 March 2002,"With films like Thir13en Ghosts and house on haunted hill, you don't take into consideration the storyline....cos you know its basically not gonna have one....and this film excepts it. Its not going to win any awards of course but it was extremely entertaining through the aid of some individual acting performances and superb special effects.The film is about Cyrus Kriticos (Abraham) who imprisions the souls of various ghosts in his fantastically crafted glass 'haunted' house. The ghosts are used to power some sort of machine that will eventually open a gateway to great demonic powers. He dies during the capture of the last ghost and passes on the ownership of his house to his nephew Arthur Kriticos (Shalhoub) and his two children, the oldest being the incredibly sexy Shannon Elizabeth.Then here comes your typical plot, ghosts escape from their captivity and terrorise the family and the 2 scientists that sneeked into the house. Although the movie was predictable, i found it very enjoyable with one or two really jumpy scenes assisted by the wonderful special effects that were used throughout the whole movie.Matthew Lillard who played Dennis Rafkin in the movie did a great job portraying the crazy psychic ghostbuster. He was the only character in the film that i felt played the part really well. Embeth Davidtz, Shannon Elizabeth and Tony Shalhoub were all below par in there roles leaving Murray Abraham with not enough screen time!The ghosts themselves looked fantastic and created a great deal of tension through each individual scene that they were in. The only serious complaint that i have with the overall movie is that the ending was rushed and gave no real satisfaction to a really good hour and something to the movie.But anyway this will be brill on DVD and i will probably buy it knowing my taste. I gave the movie an 7. Recommended to those fans of House on Haunted hill!",Thir13en Ghosts
156,pc_dean,Paging Dr. Venkman,4,31 October 2001,"Do you ever wonder where they find the people in horror movies?  You know, the people who walk into rooms covered with sinister-looking messages in indecipherable languages and just frown a little and say ""Hmm, I wonder what it means?""  People who walk blithely with only a candle into places no sane person would set foot in without extensive prepping by artillery fire?Wherever they get them, there must be quite a supply, 'cause, boy, they sure don't last long.  (It may be the same place where they get the cops in B-action pictures).Now, I'm not saying that such people (I understand the technical term of art is ""idiot in the attic"") cannot be a source of genuine entertainment and suspense.  But they need to have a good movie around them.  ""Thirteen Ghosts"", or more technically ""Thir13en Ghosts"" (which, if you think about it, is almost twice ""Se7en"", only without the atmosphere of impending existential doom) is not that movie.  It might have been, if only the writer had worked half as hard as the production designer.The plot concerns Arthur, a math teacher trying to recover emotionally and financially from a tragic event, who is visited by the creepiest lawyer Central Casting could come up with.  Creepy, esq. informs Arthur that his eccentric uncle Cyrus (F. Murray Abraham, trying valiantly to erase any memory of him as a good actor) has left him a house and a pile of money.  No one in the audience would trust this guy to pour them a glass of water, but Arthur and his family follow the lawyer to the house, since they are natives of the Land of Suicidally Stupid Horror-Movie Characters (motto: ""Let's split up."").  This despite the fact that the house (and Uncle Cyrus' unsettling video will) has glass walls, tons of cryptic writing and eerie symbols, and images of rotting, gape-jawed skulls.  I guess that's what the real-estate market will do to you.  The house is full of ghosts that Uncle Cyrus captured with his band of ghost-hunters (think of the Ghostbusters, only with Reynolds-and-Saran-wrap jackets and no sense of humor) have imprisoned.  They need the ghosts to harness their energy to power an ancient device that - oh, never mind.There is a great deal of running away from various mutilated and disgruntled ghosts (who can only be seen with special glasses), which at least gives the cast a break from speaking their flat and uninteresting lines.  Tony Shalhoub lends Arthur some tortured dignity, and of the characters who get the most screen time, his is easily the most credible performance.  Also trapped in the house are his two children, played by Shannon Elizabeth and Alec Roberts.  Partisans of the winsome Ms. Elizabeth should note that, despite her prominence in the movie's marketing, she disappears from the action for a very long stretch.  Embeth Davidtz shows up as a kind of undead-rights activist with a spell book and a bag of TNT blocks (when trapped in a haunted house, it's always advisable to bring at least one cast member from ""Army of Darkness"").  Matthew Lillard, who places an undue dramatic value on annoyance, plays an angry psychic (aren't they all?) who was helping Cyrus get the ghosts.The ghosts are really the most interesting part of the movie, as you might expect.  They are a diverse group, and their disparate energies are required to - oh, forget it.  But I was hoping for more back story on them, like who they were, how exactly they met their sundry bad ends, or why it was their bad luck to end up as the ethereal equivalent of the Energizer Bunny.  But little development of the ghosts is forthcoming, except for a few vague hints here and there, enough to pique your curiosity, but not enough to satisfy it much.In the end, ""Thirteen Ghosts"" adds up to less.  The house is cool (I can't imagine what the glazier's bill looked like), and some of the ghosts are intriguing (though quite over the top).  Mostly, it's ""Ghostbusters"" without the wit, and ""The Sixth Sense"" without the depth. But never fear; we aren't likely to run out of idiots in the attic anytime soon.",Thir13en Ghosts

161,experten,Tiresome action horror suitable for kids,3,19 April 2002,"I think the younger audiences will appreciate all the action in this movie. The audience who thinks movies like Brain Dead (Dead Alive) and From Dusk Till Dawn got better in the second half, who likes John Carpenters crappy Vampires and the ultra bad Faust: Love of the Damned, you guys will love Thir13en Ghosts (ridiculous spelling, ditto movie).The biggest problem with this movie is that it lacks atmosphere and there are too many ghost attacks, too much shouting and screaming and the actors are constantly overacting. Too much of everything ruins the movie. Think about it, a ghost movie with ghosts constantly attacking, how can you be surprised or scared ? The story is very predictable but it does not matter because the movie is revealing itself as worthless already in the first scene and it does not take very long until you get bored. The mature viewer will give up on this movie long before the pathetic turkey ending (probably approved by stupid american test audiences).There is one good scene in the movie, the bathtub scene (stolen from The Shining)plus maybe two short but OK gore scenes. The special effects make-up is good and they seem to have put some money on creating the house. The music is tiresome, it is too much.Here are some recommendations of much superior horror movies: The Thing, The Howling, The Brood and An American Werewolf in London. If you are a little older and appreciates good creepy atmosphere you should not miss The Others, Mute Witness and A Stranger Calls Back. If you want gore I can recommend some of Lucio Fulcis movies (The Beyond, House By The Cemetery and New York Ripper) and many of Dario Argentos movies. If you want really twisted and demented movies I can recommend Crawlspace, Beyond The Darkness and Combat Shock. Most people will not appreciate those movies.

I know they actually do have backstories, but the characters in the movie never mentioned them. I find that an awful shame and a waste of really amazing makeup effects on the ghosts.Also, there was no creepy atmosphere or tension. Once the ghosts start appearing, they never stop making noise and the only thing left to scare you is their visuals (which are creepy, but not enough to actually disturb you).However, this was still a decent movie with a cool premise, just not executed in the best way.

170,lea-1,"Creepy effects-laden horror, cinematic perfection",10,26 October 2001,"The opening scene in the junkyard was gruesome, loud and spectacularly awash in bloody visuals. The scene that introduces the audience to Arthur Kriticos and family was superbly done, the slow circular transition between what once was and what is now was a work of art.  Matthew Lillard was absolutely the perfect choice for Dennis Rafkin, I can't think of any other actor that could have brought that level of manic intensity to that role.  F. Murray Abraham was completely smarmy as Cyrus Kriticos and had me thinking that Cyrus's parents were perhaps never married. Rah Digga did her job well as comic relief; the audience chuckled nervously in all the right spots. Plenty of gasps and exclamations were heard from the members of the packed movie theatre.The ghost cast, oh my, menacing, chilling, frightening.  I'm not sure which ones were scarier, the noisy ones like The Juggernaut, The Hammer and The Jackal or the quietly threatening ones like The Angry Princess, The Great Child and The First Born Son.  The make-up, set design and effects crews did an amazingly outstanding job; I have never seen anything like this before. The sound effects were perfect from the grinding gears to the ghostly murmurings. I have seen the original 13 Ghosts movie complete with ""Illusion-O!"" effects on DVD and it was gloriously cheesy, William Castle made scary movies for fun, they were meant to be fun and the remake is no different in that respect; it is a fun movie, complete immersion in sights and sounds. This version kept the number of ghosts, the general foundational premise and both movies are loaded with tongue in cheek references and humor but that is where the two films part company, as they should, they were created 41 years apart so of course the remake should take advantage of the advances in film technology.  I really enjoyed this movie, I wish it had been a bit longer, spent a little more time on the background of those incredibly angry ghosts, fleshed out the living characters just a bit more, perhaps moved just a little bit slower but then, the fast-paced frenetic energy and aural/visual stimulation of the movie is what kept my eyes glued to the screen.

Despite your Oscar winning cast, Shannon Elisabeth and Matt Lillard, (where was Prinze?), the movie pretty much sucked.  The dad was the taxi driver from Wings and Shannon Elisabeth played one daughter, knockers were looking HUGE, some random Mexican kid played his son.  At one point he hears voices calling his name in basement and he goes down to check it out. Always smart in a horror movie, he probably misheard and thought they were offering him booze or a ride on a landscaping truck.  Anyway, I think Lillard dies by getting clubbed to death by a ghost.  I don't know why the ghosts were so intent on killing everyone.  If I was a ghost I'd just hang out all day, maybe play some basketball, watch some tv or sneak into women's locker rooms; killing people would be really far down on my list of things to do as a ghost.  These ghosts also had the power to touch living people, which was impressive cause it took Swayze forever to learn how to do that in that movie with Demi Moore, (either Point Break or Roadhouse I don't remember which).  If I could touch people I'd walk around all day urinating off overpasses and punching Robin Williams in the junk.  Anyway, back to the movie, the Mexican kid rides his scooter around until all the ghosts get bored and leave the house.

172,ablebravo,an almost great remake,5,28 May 2005,"Interesting film, this 13 Ghosts. Finally watched it for the first time tonight. Actually bought it on recommendation from a non-horror fan. I'll have to think about this for a while, even watch it again in a couple of days, but my first impression was ""Damn! He came SO close!"". He being Steve Beck... but I suppose in all fairness I should say they all came so close. There is obviously a great deal of work that went into this film but there was, to me, an intangible element which was lacking in the atmosphere of the film. There are some truly creepy scenes in this movie as well as some really outright jump-enough-to-spill-your-popcorn jolts, but they are oddly diluted by the transparency of the sets.Ah, the sets... lets talk about them for a minute... the entire visual conception was the best part of this film. The Conceptual Artist did a splendid job of creating a really bizarre environment that had a peculiar air of timelessness-especially in that museum-like setting. And most striking to me as I sit reflecting on the film here at the PC was the bizarre feeling of technological superimposition in any visual of the workings of the doors and panels. The visual clash of those almost medieval gears mounted to thick, hi-tech looking glass panels constantly jolted me in the sense that it was visually unclear how old the house actually was. Very odd.As to the rest... make up was spectacular, cinematography uniformly excellent. Here though, I must comment on the sudden losses of forward momentum the film's pacing seems to go through. I was actually tempted to fast scan a couple of scenes, but I didn't.Ummm acting was sub par given the calibre of its main parts (Tony Shaloob, F. Murray Abraham.), but I attribute that to weakness of overall script. I gotta give Rah Diggah big points for playing the nanny and a great comic relief... I won't even touch Embeth Davidtz's performance. She shoulda played one of the ghosts! The dialog was weak all the way thru the film, but there was an unfortunate feeling, to me at least, that in the last third or so of the film, the story line itself seems to have taken on an air of having been thrown together.Weak dialog, erratic pacing and lame musical scoring detract strongly from what could have been a far better film.

Also, I was so annoyed with the ""heroes"" that I was ready for them all to be killed off by the ghosts (many of whom, if you think about it, can not actually hurt you). The only bright spot that this film has is in the theme and makeup design of the ghosts.

In the beginning, lets clear that Cyrus is collecting ghosts for some kind of machine (which the purpose is unknown). There is a cut and the new scene star with a Arthur's family. In these scenes, is clear that Arthur was devastating with the lost of his wife, but start to recover this. Until this point the movie working good, but when Arthur and his family going to Cyrus house (Arthur is Cyrus's nephew) all movie became a mess. Exactly as a other comment said the two kids are there for one single reason bring some problems to Arthur (In other words: THIS SITUATION AGAIN?). There are only two things that save this movie of the complete failure: the performances of Tony Shaloub (as Arthur) and Mathew Lillard that try to do the best with these limited characters (ok F. Murray Abrahams don't compromise in the role of Cyrus). The situations don't work well, are nonsense and predictable. All this, is culminated with ""The End"" very weak.

This stayed true for the rest of the film.When it introduces the main family, the 'imperfectness' of them was done in a lame way. I didn't care ONE bit about any of them. When they were driving to the house, there was a shot where the car was leaving the city on a bridge, heading across the screen in one direction, then when it cut to another road with them driving past, it was going the opposite direction. Just straight forward BAD directing.In fact the only two things that were good about the movie were the house...even though it really could've been better, plus it wasn't shot very well and the lawyers death was pretty damn cool, especially how his tie falls off first.I remembered the ghosts being great.

187,Doctor_Mabuse,5/10 ***/5 ~ Slick thrill-ride is visually dazzling but just no fun.,5,13 March 2003,"Like their House on Haunted Hill (1999), Dark Castle Entertainment's remake of William Castle's 13 Ghosts (1960) plays as a grade-B cash-in on the misguided new version of The Haunting (1999), emphasizing dazzling visuals, imaginative production design and obligatory CGI effects over good old-fashioned spookery. Thir13en Ghosts (2001) has none of the charm or chills of Castle's family-friendly Halloween favorite, and the original's mild subversiveness as an Ozzie-and-Harriet ghost story is lost in the imposition of a nasty, nihilistic tone. The keynote is excess, with an overkill of self-canceling thrills. Master showman Castle, were he alive today, would no doubt have exploited gore and technical effects for all they are worth, but with the restraint necessary to allow the big moments to stand out. Castle would have known when to stop, but this version can't trust itself to entertain and wears out its welcome fast. It just isn't any fun, although some of the old Castle humor is present in amusing performances by Matthew Lillard, as a professional ghost-buster, and Rah Diggs, as a comic domestic so un-PC as to raise the specter of Mantan Moreland. But the comic material is less funny than cynically clever and self-congratulatory. Little of Robb White's original story remains, except the situation of a haunted house being inherited by an average All-American family (here an average All-Greco-American family with average All-African-American nanny), and the point-of-view is no longer that of the little boy. As dead Uncle Cyrus (White's reference to the Old Dark House classic The Cat and the Canary), F. Murray Abraham blesses the film with the kind of juicy, campy presence Vincent Price gave to Castle's House on Haunted Hill (1958) and The Tingler (1959) and which was the essential ingredient missing from the bland original.Yet the shabby little haunted house of Castle's 13 Ghosts had a warm soul, while this one's dazzling glass mansion-of-the-damned is cold and empty for all its state-of-the-art shocks.",Thir13en Ghosts

The story has the feel of something that was worked out in a couple of days on a cocktail napkin. It rushes you in with little suspense to what I suppose was meant to be an interesting plotline, but which rather winds up resembling an early episode of ""He-Man"" or some other bad cartoon of your choosing. The characters follow suit. You have the detestably cute little boy who lisps every other word, you have the ""you go girl"" token african-american nanny who I think is supposed to be comedy relief, you have the evil eccentric uncle out to conquer the universe, and a whole array of ghouls right out of the Spencers Halloween season catalogue.

I couldn't get over how many times the characters would say: "" Where are we going?"" and the response was ALWAYS ""Just Trust Me"". They would constantly be saying this and getting into arguments about trust rather then just simply saying... ""We're going here"".So all in all this movie was entertaining in a way to watch as a 6 Star Movie.

We zoom in on an empty space and then we cut to a shot of Haley Joel Osment or Nicole Kidman looking absolutely petrified.

Some, or I should say many, will find this movie loud, vulgar, irritating, and stupid.  I can't argue with them, but I will say this: It gives the audience what they want.  This film has thirteen horrible spectres that, if you met them in real life, would cause even the bravest to douse their drawers.  And they're not docile by any stretch of the imagination. They are out for blood.Imagine ""The Juggernaut,"" who picks up his victims and breaks them in half. Or ""The Hammer,"" who is run through with a couple dozen railroad spikes.

What the entire movie is missing is a climax - it just isn't going anywhere. And while the sets are very impressive, cinematography and editing are a complete and utter disaster. All these horrible quick cuts and flashes make the movie tiring and take the 'scary' element out of it, because you can never 'get into' the movie.Now, it's not bad. It's just nothing special.

Matthew Lillard as the electrics guy/psychic was very convincing at his portrayal of physically damaging disturbing thoughts, that is whenever he was attacked by a disturbing thought of a ghost or of someone's past, it looked like he had been physically attacked.  Anway, it had a pretty good cast (Shannon Elizabeth is definitely hot) and Tony Shaloub is great as the widowed father.  There are two scenes in the movie which are graphically disturbing, so viewers beware.  At one scene, the idiotic lawyer is cut in half by a door and then later on, a woman is crushed between two walls of glass.

But due to the terrible camera work and cheesy ""flashing"" effects, you were barely able to make out any of these ghosts. The mansion that the movie was set in was really ""out there"" in terms of design, and it didn't help the movie at all.

But when I saw it, I just couldn't conceive of how this was allowed to be made.First, let me just say that I was disappointed with there being only thirteen ghosts. I saw the DVD packaging and the number of different ghost pictures on the front. Now that I look at it, I see that they are all only among the thirteen ghosts. See, when I first picked the movie up, I thought there were dozens of ghosts, and only 'Thirteen Ghosts' was a clever title.Second, acting. Tony Shaloub isn't convincing at all when it came to playing Arthur. And that annoying Bobby kid. F. Murray Abraham is alright, but isn't as good as he could be. And the number of cliché moments in the film really bothered me, especially the credit sequence with the SAME happy family and the SAME happy brother-sister relationship and the SAME loving, warm, fuzzy family, and finally, the SAME disaster that tears them all apart.Third, the make-up. While the ghosts are very interesting to look at, I could tell it was really sloppy make-up. The hammer guy and the juggernaut were awful. I would say the only interesting make-up would be the lawyer getting sliced in half by the glass.And last, the ending. Another cliché. The SAME ""oh, we're all together now kids, everything's gonna be alright. The ghosts are freed and we can live a happy life."" Wrong.

And I've always thought the movie was pretty damn entertaining and creepy.Let's start off with the bad. The acting and dialogue is beyond bad. It feels like you're watching a lifetime special at times and it's just cringeworthy at times. Now with that being said there was a great performance given by Matthew Lillard. Perhaps the star of the show acting wise.The overall plot was just executed terribly. The filmmaker tries to give us backstory so we can connect with the family but it just falls short and we find them more annoying than anything, especially his ungrateful entitled daughter.Oh an Rah Digga who plays the cool swearing nanny, is quite possibly the worst nanny in existence. See the film and you'll know why.Other than that I'd say the film was pretty damn entertaining and creepy. Its problem is at times it tries to take itself too seriously when it shouldn't be taken as such. The special effects/costume/makeup/sound effecte are the best part of this film.

(How can they afford a housekeeper?)But the children are brats, they don't listen (which makes you dislike them, automactically you forget about their mother is dead) the Daughter (Shannon Elizabeth) is only eye candy in the movie.. The son is morbid, he reads the obituraries into his 'My Little Recorder'. Disturbing....  And the housekeeper who doesn't do any work...These qualities make you dislike them.. Had they had more redeeming characteristics you would like them. The only member of the family that you like is the father. He's trying to do the best he can.. He is an average Joe, trying to support his family and get but in life, missing his wife in the process....The film could have been better than it was.

Many were visually realized in an effective way (especially the Jackal).  The story just didn't utilize them in any effective way.Maybe I just didn't care enough about the main characters to want to see them survive.

Tony Shalhoub is the only noteworthy player as his character has the biggest range of emotions. Matthew Lillard could have done well except for being too spastic. Shannon Elizabeth is obviously nothing more than eye candy since she never gets much of a chance to show that she can be more. Rah Digga seems like she was plucked from a pre 1950's Disney cartoon. F. Murray Abraham works as the villain since he has the most menacing look.The attempts at humor were what held the movie together and kept it from becoming boring.

Unfortunately, new additions to the All Hallow's Eve staples (which, for me, include fare such as Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Dawn of the Dead and John Carpenter's Halloween) which bear up under repeated ritualistic viewing, are few and far between. This season, the most visible attempts are the remake of Thirteen Ghosts and Bones.Thirteen Ghosts was once a black and white grade C matinée of the early '60s made by low-budget schlockmeister William Castle; now it's an opulent and expensive-looking remake directed by special effects art director Steve Beck, responsible for some of the visual look of such films as The Hunt for Red October, The Abyss and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. Considering his resume, Beck doesn't disappoint in the visuals of the film, in which widowed single dad Art Kriticos (Tony Shalhoub), avoiding creditors, is delighted to learn that he has inherited his late uncle Cyrus's mansion. When he and kids Shannon Elizabeth (American Pie) and Alec Roberts (Traffic) arrive with smart aleck nanny Maggie (Rah Digga), they discover that Cyrus's ""house"" is a bizarre fusion of hi-tech and medieval influences featuring glass walls, ceilings and floors etched with phosphorescent Latin inscriptions. Before they can even get over how nifty-neato it all is, an ersatz Ghostbuster (Matthew Lillard) arrives to inform them that they have fallen into Cyrus's elaborate trap: The house is a gigantic machine ""powered by the dead,"" one of those pesky interdimensional portals between Earth and Hell which, of course, requires a human sacrifice to finish its arcane spell. About the only aspect the remake shares with its progenitor is the gimmick of the characters wearing special goggles that enable them to see the wraiths, who are all, of course, bent on mortal misery.Visually, the film is stunning, featuring spectacular set design and horrific make-ups, some reminiscent of the Cenobites in Clive Barker's Hellraiser series. Plotwise, the picture meanders, confused, through a far worse maze than the house itself. After a somewhat involving credits sequence cleverly suggesting the events behind the loss of his wife, you settle into a familiar formula of waiting to see who gets killed and who doesn't, and not nearly enough people do, although the ghosts do in Uncle Cyrus's lawyer in a fairly novel way, prompting the best line in the picture: ""Hey, where's the lawyer -- did he split?"" By the time Embeth Davidtz (Bridget Jones's Diary) shows up as another Ghostbuster, you just don't care anymore, which is a shame for Tony Shalhoub, who has long contributed memorable performances to such films as Big Night and The Siege, as well as funny turns in Men in Black and Galaxy Quest. It was a nice opportunity for him to carry a film, but by the third time everyone decides to split up ""and we'll meet back here in five minutes,"" you figure they all deserve to die.Less expensive-looking but just as visually atmospheric is Ernest Dickerson's Bones, which also takes place in a haunted house, except this one is downtown in a devastated 'hood. Once the home of gangster Jimmy Bones (Snoop Doggy Dogg), the house is now one of the creepiest places you've ever seen on film, augmented by computer-generated shadows that flow over the walls like sick black ichor right out of the pages of Lovecraft. Seems Jimmy Bones, a ""good"" gangster who vanished twenty years ago right as crack started hitting the neighborhood, has never been found, but you just know when a bunch of hip-hop bros decide to renovate the house into a nightclub that they're going to find out what happened, especially when Jimmy's old squeeze (Pam Grier, seen recently in Ghosts of Mars) keeps warning them to run while they can. But, hey, if the demoniac wolf-dog with the red glowing eyes who barfs up maggots all the time doesn't scare them away, you start to figure they deserve their fate just about as much as the homeys in the other movie.Yet, Bones still has more of a heart than Thirteen Ghosts, and builds excellently on the tradition of the blaxploitation films of the early '70s that proved black people go to movies too, and of which Grier was a seminal star in films like Foxy Brown (plus, she still looks pretty good for a gal in her mid-fifties). The breakdown occurs whenever The Dogg himself appears, but it's not necessarily his fault. He gave far better performances in Baby Boy and his cameo in Training Day. With his gaunt look and that '70s pimp suit, he has a striking appearance that makes for a great movie monster, visually, but he's just not given much to do. You want to see more of him and Grier, with the most involving sequence being a flashback that reveals the secret story of their tragedy, but the film concerns itself more with, as they say in endless Scooby Doo cartoons, ""those darn kids.""Visually, Bones does a lot with a little, probably to be expected from director Dickerson, who was Spike Lee's cinematographer on films such as Do the Right Thing and Mo' Better Blues, and who directed a previous spirited supernatural romp, Demon Knight, which was a better film. But it falls down badly with its actors, particularly Michael Weiss (TV's The Pretender) as an aging cop-on-the-take, sporting some of the worst old-age make-up I've ever seen in a picture.Visually, both films deliver the creeps. Though Thirteen Ghost's budget is obviously more stratospheric, I prefer the sets in Bones as well as, ultimately, its more tragic characters.",Thir13en Ghosts
212,Wham-3,Better than I expected,6,13 May 2002,"I was pleasantly suprised by the scariness this movie managed to evoke. Most horror movies don't manage to give a hard core viewer the creeps no matter how many gross special effects they employ.  Ususally what you get is more of a squeamishness at the grossness of it all.  The ghosts in this flick do manage to convey a sense of menace.  It's too bad the living cast isn't nearly as effective, otherwise this might have been a really good ghost story.  Still, the special effects are creative and the glass house is a nice touch.  6 out of 10.",Thir13en Ghosts
213,kevin86,"Creepy, disturbing, fun!",8,3 June 2002,"Its rare to see a horror movie nowadays that manages to both creep you out and keep a solid plot. 13 Ghosts has succeeded in doing this, and while some of the acting may seem a little overdone (Mathew Lillard), overall the film was a great remake to a classic film.As much as I love classic horror movies, the old black and white films with bad visual effects is only entertaining the first time through. thats how I felt towards William Castle's original 13 Ghosts, it was great for his time, and fun to watch once, but not again. Now that Dark Castle has revived the old experience with better visual effects, cool storyline twists, a cast of awsome ghosts (as well as the creative idea for the glasses), and a cool 1 location set, I really found I appreciated the movie better. Sure you may think at first that the glass house is a stupid idea, but honestly, its pretty brilliant. Not only has it never been done, but its succeeded in doing it. To make things interesting, strange latin (or something) is carved on the glass as containment spells to keep the ghosts from just walking about. And while the body count for such a small place may seem a little low, the thrills and effects make up for it.Still, the greatest thing about the movie is the ghosts themselves. They are as follows: The Angry Princess, The Bound Woman, The First Born Son, The Great Child, The Torso, The Hammer, The Jackal, The Juggernaut, The Dire Mother, The Pilgrimess, The Withered Lover, and The Torn Prince. These are the ACTUAL stars of the film, and they do a great job at being freaky. I just could help but be creeped out by The Jackal and disturbed by the Angry Princess, and while some of the ghosts werent shown as much as others (Pilgrimess, Torso), what was shown of them was pretty cool.
So watch the movie, and judge it for yourself, but in my eyes, it was a blast. Dont miss out on this great remake.",Thir13en Ghosts

It never ceases to amaze me how studios that have extremely deep pockets allow something this atrocious to be made. The studio executives would have been better off throwing their $20 million in a fire pit because it would have been much more worthwhile than spending it on making this film. The best actors in the movie are actually the ghosts themselves, which are pretty hard roles to screw up considering that a lot CGI was involved I'd imagine. The only single positive element to come from this crime of a movie are the rather impressive set pieces. So if you have dreams of one day being a set designer maybe you would want to watch this thing and know how to make good sets for future GOOD films, otherwise avoid this trash at all costs.

218,batocicero,"Pretty enjoyable, hardly scary",7,16 November 2009,"Even though I'm not a huge fan of scary movies (mostly because I'm hardly scared by them), but I decided to give this one a shot. I found it entertaining, though certainly not scary. Not one bit. Also, the main characters are pretty shallow, and the nanny (I personally think) is annoying as hell, and completely useless. She could have been dropped and I wouldn't have noticed. They could have developed Dennis Ratkin more, but he is the best human character as it is. And I have to say this, Shannon Elizabeth does NOT look like a teenager, and is totally unconvincing as such (the line ""Daddy!"" while sobbing after being attacked by a ghost is kind of pathetic). And that other girl, Katrina or whatever her name is, is quite unidimensional (huh, looks like the female characters need some polishing in this movie).However, the main plot and the story device (most salient is the invented Black Zodiac signs) are pretty good, and the ghosts' design is pretty creative. They could have been scarier or darker, but they are good enough and well developed. In fact, the reason why I bought the DVD was because of the extras where the history of each ghost is revealed. It's one of my favorite easter eggs in a movie, hands down. The creepiest character by far is not a ghost, but the kid! What does that say? A brat being all psyched up by a ""decloplotated"" (read: decapitated) man near a donut store? What the hell? Maybe if they have pushed this kid more into the dark ""side"" during the whole movie, it would have had scarier moments. Perhaps he could have been brainwashed by the Latin chants and become some sort of a lure for his parent and sister to be drawn to the ghosts or something.Oh, and my favorite scene is the intro (where the Juggernaut is caught). The only truly suspenseful moment of the movie.Anyways, good flick, good story, amazing concept of the twelve ghosts. 7/10, because it could have been better, to be honest. Worth watching at least once; more so the DVDs clips about the ghosts.",Thir13en Ghosts

220,insult2injury,"Perfect movie for Halloween, but not a perfect movie",9,29 October 2001,"This was the best movie to release on Halloween weekend, but that's not to say it was a perfect movie.  First of all, the set design was amazing. The house they get stuck in is not just made of glass walls and floors, it's etched glass.  Plus, the walls and floors constantly move, some of which was awesome computer graphics, but most was actually moving sets.  The set designer should get nominated for an Oscar, it's that cool.  Now, onto the story.  I won't get too deep into this, since I don't want to ruin anything. Just suffice it to say that the story wasn't especially strong, but in a film like this, that's almost forgivable.  The plot started off semi-fantastic, and ended up in the near-ridiculous.  But, again, no sweat. I didn't go to think, I went to be scared.  --  The acting was ok, with a hodge-podge cast of characters.  The only character I had a problem with was the black nanny.  They had written some good stuff for her, until halfway through the movie.  During a slower moment in the story, they ran out of intelligent dialogue for her, and she started spouting out token black sayings, like ""Stuck in a room with crazy white people"", and at the end she says something similar.  This leads me to believe that the writer's thought the movie might be too intense, and needed someone to be comic relief. But, I have to tell you, it was completely out of place, and her character became disposable.  Besides, we already had comic relief, (albeit DARK comic relief), in the form of Matthew Lillard, of ""Scream"" fame.  --  As mentioned before, the visual special effects are great.  The makeup effects are very cool on the 12 ghosts, (the 13th ghost is the secret to the story).  The editing was effective, although at times I knew what it felt like to have epilepsy.  The sound effects and creepy score were the real key to making this movie scary.  There are, fortunately, plenty of weird sounds and whispered voices in the theater to make you look behind you. Unfortunately, however, some of the key sound effects were turned up so loud that it was almost painful.  I imagine the producers wanted to give that extra ""push"" to the audience, but it was somewhat distracting.  --  Now, a couple of things I wanted to point out about specific things in the movie, one good and one bad.  First of all, in case you don't know, the idea of putting on special glasses in order to see the ghosts is taken directly from the original ""13 Ghosts"" by William Castle.  In the 50's, Castle was the P.T. Barnum of filmmaking, and would do anything to scare an audience.  He was known for flying a skeleton over the crowd's head during ""House on Haunted Hill"", and even making theater goers sign a waiver before going into the movie, which released William Castle from prosecution in case the viewer died of fright. In another picture, he rigged all the theater seats so that he could give the audience a small electric shock during a pivotal scene.  For the original ""13 Ghosts"", viewers were given a pair of special glasses, similar to 3-D glasses, and were told that if you got too scared during the film, just take off the glasses, and the ghosts would disappear.  This piece of quirky nostalgia was not only mentioned in the remake, but it was made an intregal part of the plot.  Very cool, indeed.  -- **MINOR SPOILER AHEAD** --  The only goof I found in the film was a BIG one.  Lillard's character makes a point to tell us that the glass walls are soundproof.  Later, he's stuck inside one of the glass rooms without his trusty glasses.  He gave the glasses to the black nanny, who says ""I'm sorry"" for locking him in there. And he hears her!  Then, when he's attacked in the same room by a nasty ghost, she starts yelling instructions like, ""Duck!"" and ""Move!""  Yeah, soundproof, right.",Thir13en Ghosts
221,morgana-6,Average Fare,5,8 November 2002,"I probably would have avoided this after seeing the trailers on HBO. I like my ghost stories 'pure' rather than the result of some mechanical means (the recent remake of Shirley Jackson's The House comes to mind). But I noticed that Tony Shalhoub was in it, and having become a fan of his Mr. Monk series on USA, I thought I'd give it a try. His low-key performance was the best thing about the film. The occult elements were ho-hum; the ghosts were ugly but not scary. F. Murray Abraham was wasted as the evil uncle, who sets up his nephew and his children. And one of the biggest missing plot elements is just exactly was the goal of the uncle and what would have happened if he succeeded in activating the machine? It's kind of hard to get invested in an outcome if you don't know the stakes. The special effects are fine, but I'd only recommend it to those who must see all B films of this ilk, or completist fans of Tony Shalhoub.",Thir13en Ghosts

Then, one day, he finds out his uncle Cyrus (F. Muarry Abraham) has died and inherited his huge mansion to him.

Sitting through this movie was painful, especially after having seen ""The Others"" in the cinema two months before. It is not a thriller, it is a special effects-makeup-and-outlandish-props movie. The ""ghosts"" are so heavily made-up they end up looking hilarious rather than scary, the cinematography (read : loads and loads of split-second clips) reeks of MTV, and the characters transparent and stereotyped.Naturally, a weird guy is out to control the world. Naturally, an innocent family is unwittingly caught in the middle. Naturally, someone strays away and everyone starts looking for him. Naturally, all hell breaks loose and there's lots of running, screaming, and gore. Naturally, the big bad guy overlooks one minor thing, he gets defeated, and the world is saved.
The only innovation are special glasses needed to actually see the ghosts. But question is, why would you want to look at them? They have lame names, all go to the same beauty parlor and all do the same thing. The only thing that is good about them is that they want to kill the cast, who are all so uninteresting, unendearing characters that you wouldn't mind seeing them dead anyway. Effects, effects and more effects. Thirteen Ghosts relies solely on effects to scare its audience, and fails miserably.

239,sonnyrainy6,Yet another bottom-of-the-barrel remake,2,18 July 2014,"Why, Why, Why was this movie made? The answer simply is: Hollywood want to remake everything. But why do they have to make them sooo bad? That's a question that no one knows the answer to. This remake of the 1960 William Castle film was completely unnecessary and is a joke of a movie, and is as bad as other remakes like 'Prom Night' and 'The Fog'.The plot: When their wealthy grandfather dies, the Kriticos family inherit his house. They are amazed by it, as it has transparent walls with cryptic writing on them. There are also 12 ghosts contained in the basement that are inadvertently unleashed and terrorise them and their nanny. The plot is weird. It had some pretty confusing elements to it, like why a 13th ghost was needed in the first place, and I didn't really like the idea of only being able to see the ghosts through a pair of special glasses. But I can't really blame the screenwriters of this trash, as this did originally come from William Castle.The acting/characters: This whole section is what made the movie excruciating to watch. The acting was completely bland, and it was all really hammy. There's also no character development whatsoever. But the worst thing about this movie is the casting. It has to be the worst casting in movie history. I mean, Matthew Lillard in a somewhat serious role? You have to be kidding me. Also, Rah Digga as the nanny comes off as someone from a Tyler Perry movie, making sassy comments and trying to generate humour, except it's not funny at all. On top of all that, the script sucked too.The scares/special effects: This movie is not scary. It seems like the director thought it was more of a comedy, so it replaced what could've been scares with unfunny dialogue. I thought that some of the gore effects were OK, but the CGI looked cheap and unrealistic. The make up and pure concept for some of the ghosts was terrible. For example, one ghost wears some sort of metal helmet that's split open where the face is. It looked so much like fondant that I was laughing. One of the ghosts was also some sort of fat adult 'baby' which had me in hysterics. It looked hilarious! I wasn't surprised to see that the ghosts were done by the same people who did the make up for 'Ghosts Of Mars', as they looked pretty much the same. The set was the only redeemable thing in this movie. It was pretty much perfect and definitely gave the movie a more stylish feel.Summary: The set was the only thing that impressed me in this movie. The casting and acting sucked, the special effects sucked and this movie in general sucked. Don't watch it!",Thir13en Ghosts

Aside from a funny line here and there, this movie shows no discernible quality that makes it worth watching. Sure, the implausible, mechanical glass house with the allegedly Latin inscriptions on the walls is rather interesting to look at, but, unfortunately, glimpses of it are interrupted and marred by the silly film that keeps intruding.Scenes of gratuitous gore actually become quite silly. Take, for instance, the scene in which one character (I won't say who) is sliced in half by a set of apparently razor-sharp doors. Folks, this is strictly adolescent fare at best. I can picture it now, a room full of 15-year-olds (my apologies at this point to intelligent 15-year-olds everywhere, for these filmmakers are below you) guffawing and saying things like, ""Dude, wouldn't it be, like, totally cool if his head just, like, explodes, spewing brains and s*** everywhere?! That would be, like, so awesome. We should have one guy, like, get cut in half, you know.""I'm sorry, but my patience has really been worn thin by misplaced attempts at creating horror. Horror is not about seeing people cut in half by glass doors or about seeing mutilated corpses in bathtubs full of blood. It's about suspense, which this film, tragically, possesses little of. It's just one ugly scene of gratuitous gore, violence and/or nudity after another. It seems that Beck's idea was merely to throw graphic scenes at his audience in rapid-fire fashion in an effort to terrorize or sicken them, none of which he achieves. I found myself laughing at scenes that were supposed to be shocking. I laughed because I could not take them seriously. It was like watching a film made by juveniles for juveniles based on what they thought would be ""awesome"" or scary.Simply put, this movie is just far too stupid to be scary or the least bit suspenseful. Even the opening scene is too overdone to be taken seriously, and it goes downhill from there.I watched the original ""13 Ghosts"" when I was a child, and I remember thinking it was a really spooky movie. When it recently aired on TV, I sat up late and watched it, and, even though I didn't find it quite as scary as I remembered, I thoroughly enjoyed the campiness of it. The original film at least does offer some truly suspenseful scenes and actually possesses a plot that intrigues and engages the audience. When it was over, I thought to myself that it would be really neat if it were remade. Sadly, I have discovered, this is not true. With filmmakers like Beck running amok, old classics and pseudo-classics are best left alone.",Thir13en Ghosts

It is not that it is so bad that it is laughable, it is that it is so bad it is painful to watch. My friend next to me began staring at the wall because he just couldn't stand the stupidity anymore.There is no buildup and the characters are instantly thrown into the plot with little background. This makes it so the audience couldn't care less what happens to these people, and actually hopes they get killed so we won't have to hear them spout their pointless lines any longer. It was as if the makers of this film got all the special effects done and then realized they forgot to write plot and dialogue.Therefore, the audience is given such classic cliches  as ""This house is so big. We will never get this done. Let's split up."" I just kept being dumbstruck by all the stupid angles this movie was trying to go in. The acting was laughable and I am surprised the performers could keep a straight face while delivering their ridiculous lines. The worst of these characters was the terrible exploitation of the fast talking black actress whose soul purpose in the film was to spout off stupid tired cliched lines that are intended to get a laugh. Shannon Elizabeth, although beautiful, also shared in this pathetic wasteland of meaningless lines and had no point in this movie beyond being pretty. Her little brother was equally terrible and I was glad they forgot about the two during half the movie.
The film also contradicts itself an many ways- the actors can talk freely through the ""soundproof"" glass. Also, when the house is foiled in a unbelievably easy manner, this ""unbreakable"" glass explodes. Interesting....Avoid this film at all costs.",Thir13en Ghosts
246,simono84,Wasted potential and a waste of time,2,5 November 2002,"Thirteen Ghosts has a stupid plot, is poorly acted and has some cheesy as hell dialogue. But, hopefully, you already expect this. But this movie could have been a little bit scary, or at the very least fun. But it's not.	First, let's get the good points of the movie out of the way. This won't take long. The movie's major pull is the gore. And it has some gore that is inspired. Blood and death. Not enough to make it worth the 90 minutes, however, but there are some nice moments. Also, the premise is interesting. Not the plot, but the premise. There's a house with glass walls and violent ghosts. Nothing earth shattering here, but interesting. Some of the ghosts have themselves interesting back stories. These aren't explored in the film, but they have names that hint at something, and they look cool. The set design and make up are also good. There's one or two good 'jump' scares (but another two hundred that fail).	That's about it. Thirteen Ghosts has four major failings, or five if you count the child, who apart from being very annoying is the worst cast child actor since Ruthie in 7th Heaven. Firstly, it takes itself way too seriously. It attempts a couple of plot twists and tries to give us some sympathy for the characters. It's hard to care whether they live or die- some characters you want dead- but there are attempts made to make us care. These attempts fail. Then there's the complete lack of atmosphere, which is something that all good horror movies need. I believe The Sixth Sense was overrated, but this beats this movie by so much. The choice for a glass house was an attempt to make this movie modern, rather than having a big, old, creepy house on a hill. But big, old, creepy houses on hills are atmospheric and in the right hands, scary. Dark Castle's first movie (this is it's second, I think) was The House on Haunted Hill. That was also nearly as cheesy as this movie, but it had atmosphere as well as just gore.	Thirdly, there's the fact that we have twelve ghosts here. Yes, the title is thirteen ghosts, but there are twelve. There is a story saying who the thirteenth ghost is and what they do but it's too silly to go into in any detail. But, we have twelve ghosts, and the majority of them do nothing. About four of them actually cause harm, and another has significance to the characters, but the rest we only see fleetingly. They perhaps bang on the glass a little to shock the characters or stand at the end of a hallway, but that's it. This movie could have had many more scenes with characters being chased or at the very least scared by these ghosts, but it doesn't. There is a lot of untapped potential.	Finally- and this is what robbed the film of being at all scary- there's the editing. The editor must have swallowed thirteen ecstasy tablets before starting work on the movie. The editing robs the audience of having any chance of getting a sense of the house. The house could have been really cool, but the camera cuts so much, and speeds up, and snaps between seeing the ghosts and not, and it makes it impossible to know where the characters are in comparison to each other and a possible escape route. Most of the movie could effectively have been shot in one length of corridor, instead of wasting money building the maze on the set that they did. Instead of the tracking though the house, we get millisecond cuts of various identical looking glass rooms with monstrous ghosts mugging the camera. Instead of the ghosts being introduced in a way that gives them menace, we get a FLASH, FLASH, FLASH introduction. All attempts to scare come from a quick cut to a ghost with a loud noise, rather than having some sort of build up. Also, all the scenes with characters actually getting attacked never run their full length. They are always have other scenes cut into them, and this ruins any effect they may have had. In the end it just gets irritating.	Thirteen Ghosts (or Thir13en Ghosts, as it is often stupidly called) did have potential. It was never going to be brilliant, and no one expects it to be. Plot holes and bad acting are practically considered a necessary element in the post-Scream wave of horror movies. But it could have been so much better. If you want a movie that's scary, get Halloween. If you want a movie that's fun and gory, get Evil Dead 2. If you think Shannon Elizabeth is hot, get American Pie.2/10",Thir13en Ghosts
247,movybuf,Funniest movie I have seen in a while,1,11 April 2002,"I just watched ""Thir13en Ghosts"" on DVD last night and I must say I haven't laughed that hard in a long time. This film is a joke. The plot has so many holes in it you have to wonder what ended up on the cutting room floor. Speaking of the cutting room floor what was with all of those quick jump cuts? There was no purpose! My theory is that they had to cut quickly so the audience couldn't tell how poorly the make-up effects were done on the ghosts. And finally, I have to mention the end. Why, oh why, did the black housekeeper make a little hip-hop beat out of the ancient satanic chant? Why would she do it, did she see a purpose in it? It looked to me like she was mindlessly fumbling around with the controls, but then out came this nice sounding record scratch, and not even on a record. It was a reel-to-reel!

248,bhy1976,Special effects with little else.,2,3 June 2006,"If you expect little more from a film than good special-effects, then you may find this film worthy of your time. If, however, you value character depth along with an interesting story-line, I suggest that you not spend your time watching this film. First, the characters in this film are very flat, all of whom embody the values typical of what the moderately educated middle-class place so high: a reverence and desire for all things that, on the surface, seem worthy of attaining (money). More specifically you have the 'caring, yet bumbling Dad just trying to secure a future for his family'; 'the hot and naive teenage daughter', whom, because of her good looks, we are supposed to pity when she is unjustly assaulted by one of the ghosts ; 'the mouthy Negro woman who 'tells it like it is''; and, of course, 'the sketchy character of the family that cannot be trusted', namely the rich uncle.The story-line of the film is told before the backdrop of these lame characters. And as if the plot were not already predictable, it is then explained to the viewer TWICE! The result is devastating for the movement of the plot, as any interesting ending it could have had is laid bare for the viewer. The reason for this self-sabotage suggests that the makers of this film either believe its viewers to be completely stupid, or have no clear idea how to tell a story with an eye to holding the audience's interest. This is not a work of art as good cinema is, but just a collection of archetypal characters supporting a very tired and weak formulaic story-line. The special-effects are fairly good, but they can and never will be a replacement for rounded characters, an interesting story-line, and artful scripting.

251,fraptacular,Not that bad!,8,8 April 2002,"I've heard so many bad things about this movie, but having seen it, I think it succeeds on the levels to which the filmmakers were aspiring.  It's scary, it's creepy, and it's actually touching in parts.  So many reviewers had a low opinion of this film, and maybe it ""worked"" on me because I saw it in my home at 2am with the lights out.  And actually I thought the DVD feature where they tell you about the lives and deaths of the ghosts was thoroughly creepy.  In fact I had to put on NCAA basketball to get de-creeped.  I loved the makeup, it had a good story, good acting, good directing, a great house (as a major character), pretty good pacing, and neat special effects.  I really did like this movie and was expecting to just hate it.  The only thing that sneaks in to make it a little more like the formulaic horror movies of our day is the Rah Digga babysitter character, who interjects retarded lines like ""Man, I'm gonna die with 3 white people,"" ""I need a pay raise,"" and ""That's it, I can't take it anymore, I quit!"" when faced with the ghosts.  I don't think Rah Digga did a bad job, but I think her character was even sort of unnecessary.  Every function her character performed could have been achieved with some other character.  Like I said, she's not a bad actress and did what she could. But that character is the one major flaw in the movie.  She even steals away the last shot in the movie--don't worry, no spoiler--which should have been left for the more sentimental part of the movie.  I would have thought that would have been more satisfying than seeing her wandering around shouting. Other than that character, the rest of the movie was not only not as bad as I thought, but actually a real standout in the horror movies I've seen in the last few years.  I haven't seen one that really scared the crap out of me in quite a while either!  I think Thirteen Ghosts just really exceeds expectations on all levels.",Thir13en Ghosts

Just as well really. The house is indeed very cool and stylishly designed but unfortunately like many aspects of the movie amazingly underused. One magically inscribed glass wall is very much like another and we only see three or four rooms that allow some variation in the camera angle. The ghosts are well created and the stroboscopic flashes make the most out of their appearance but they are underused as well. We see three or four of them actually do something (the naked female ghost obviously gets the most screen time) while the others appear briefly, look a bit distressed for a second (probably disappointed they didn't get _more_ screen time) and then we don't see them again until the end. We learn nothing about their histories or how they died (do the producers expect everyone to read about them on the web site?) or where they were captured. SPOILER ...On the way to the end of the movie plot logic gets locked out of the house and the essential ""love conquers all cliche"" gets locked in. Shannon Elizabeth vanishes and reappears without explanation, Embeth Davidtz changes sides for no clear reason, and the ghosts are summoned instantly to another room making this viewer wonder why it was necessary to have a super-complicated machine to set them loose to wander around the house in the first place ... Less running around screaming and a longer running time to flesh out the ghosts would have made a big difference.

The design of the house was amazing and the sound-effects (sliding metal, moans/groans, loud cackling, ceremonial chanting) were very disturbing.

(If you have the dvd and watch the histories of the ghosts, then this will become more clear).
The camera work and editing was great. I especially loved the scene when we are first taken to the basement and are given a glimpse of the ghosts that haunt the house in a series of quick flashes. The acting was not bad. It was a little overdone on Mathew Lillards part and a little cheesy on the son's (Alec Robert's) part. Also Rah Digga was funny but I was just like, ""what is she doing in this movie?""
But other than that, I had a great time watching it, and this movie stuck with me a lot longer than most other horror flicks!",Thir13en Ghosts

""So completely not scary"" wouldn't be an accurate enough comment to describe this piece of utter crap.

266,velvetelvis,The Real Horror In This Movie Is The Plot And Acting,3,28 October 2001,"The ghosts aren't the only thing dead in this flick.  I went to this film expecting to receive some real chills and shocks . . . BUT NOT ONE!!  Yes, there is lots of action and gore, but there is really nothing stimulating, just a lot of mindless junk.Obviously, all efforts were put into the special effects, while the plot AND acting were like something from a junior high school play--sloppy, unprofessional, very poorly done.  The house is the real star, but is wasted HERE.  The house is actually pretty cool and had potential, but for this alone is not worth the price of admission.  The characters were all two-dimensional.  Matthew Lillard plays one of the main characters, if that tells you anything.  I can't believe anyone actually pays this doofus to ""act""--if that is what you want to call it.  He couldn't act if his life depended on it (and in this film, IT DOES).  They must have spent all of their money on the special effects and couldn't afford any real talent--aside from Tony Shalhoub, whom I happen to like, but he wasn't given much to work with, and I'm not sure about Shannon Elizabeth since she is never given any roles with substance.  Matthew Lillard just keeps doing the same ""I'm CRAZY, maaaan . . . I'm on the freakin' edge, maaan . . .I'm straining to make my face red like I might go postal or possibly pull a groin muscle"" routine.  I kept thinking, ""Please, somebody put him (and us) out of his misery early in the film so we do not have to suffer through this.  They even use the cliched ""kid with a speech impediment for cuteness effect""--cheap manipulation.  Most of the characters are really not that likeable or just have no depth so that they really do not elicit any sympathy from the audience.  We are not given any cause to really care what happens to them.  Actually, the special effects are uneven.  Here we have this elaborate sci-fi house, but the blood looks like red ink.  Blood is thick and opaque, not watery and transparent.  Might have wanted to do a little research on that one (heavy dose of sarcasm).***Possible Spoilers Ahead*** Here are a few things that I think deserve explanation.  1) If the family is so poor that they can't pay their bills or keep an apartment, how can they afford a live-in babysitter/housekeeper 2) who refuses to do any work and can't even watch the stupid kid for a few minutes?  3) OK, all of the ghosts have died violent deaths . . .granted.  But did they all die in the Spanish Inquisition or were they residents of Bedlam or what?  The intricate torture devises are like something H.R. Geiger designed.  4) And if dying a violent death causes them to become deadly, then what about the mother?  5) Where do these cheesy half-witted ancient texts that supposedly hold the key to another dimension and exercise power over the dead come from in all these films?  Miss Cleo?  Not Einstein, that's for sure.  6) If some ancient mystic designed this house, how do you account for modern appliances and why the unnecessary, extravagant, priceless furnishings?  7) Shop glasses that allow you to see the dead?  8) Why don't you need them to see the dead uncle?  If he's not really dead, why didn't he stitch that gash and change clothes, for crying out loud?  9) What's up with the cheap transparent raincoats everyone is wearing during the film's opening sequence?  They obviously don't protect them from ghosts.  (There are other plot holes that stood out, but I am too tired to remember them.)  Just give us one thing that we can actually swallow and accept as a remote possibility.The concept for this movie is a great idea, but falls flat due to bad writing and acting.  They should have stuck to making MTV videos and left filmmaking to the professionals.  This movie continuously insults the audience's intelligence.  They try to set up some plot-twists that are pretty thin.  I long for earlier days of horror films when filmmakers did not rely solely on special effects to carry a film, but rather on intelligent storylines and plot, good atmosphere, and solid acting.  I am not against special effects, it's just that they could be used more effectively to create suspense if there was an intelligent (and intelligible) plot to follow.  Hollywood is contributing to the dumbing-down of society with crap like this.  (One positive note:  There were no Matrix/Crouching Tiger-style fight scenes--THAT idea has been milked just a little too often.)  I think the story gave a few nods to Hellraiser (a scarier film)--Like the puzzlebox from Hellraiser, the house itself is a puzzle which has ancient encryptions and is the key to another dimension. And of course the ghosts which look like the tortured Cenobites of Hellraiser.  I have never seen the original William Castle version, and based on my knowledge of his films, it probably wasn't any better, but if you're looking for a good haunted house movie, try The Haunting (The original--The remake was another movie that relied too much on special effects), The Legend of Hell House, or The Sentinel.  (Sorry, no special effects, here, just good, creepy fun.)  For good scares AND special effects, see John Carpenter's remake of The Thing.  If you liked the remake of House on Haunted Hill, then go ahead and throw away another $6.50.  All others look for scares elsewhere.",Thir13en Ghosts
267,Kimerawolf,An Excellent Ghost Movie.,8,14 March 2007,"I have to admit that this is the only film, that when i went to see it in the cinema, i actually saw the popcorn effect in action. That moment when the ghost appears behind the glass and Rafkin screams, that was when the snack food started to fly. That in itself says something very good about this movie. Packed with brilliant special effects, an all star cast, some truly funny moments, some truly jumpy moments, and possibly the best haunted house ever made.... This movie is very high on my list of films i would recommend.After scream i really thought that Lillard had found his calling in the Horror/Slasher Genres, this films reinforces that with avengance, he plays the character perfectly, it is like the part was written for him. He is an excellent actor anyway, but this movie really provided him with a chance to shine.The person who designed the ghost for this film should get some kind of award for them, they are nothing short of genius, with a high gross out factor, and a big shock factor when they first appear. They storyline as well is a very clever piece of thinking, and the house is sheer beauty to anyone who loves interesting architecture, the idea that it is a huge key/machine into hell is very neat. But i can't help feeling that every time i watch it transform a little more from the outside that it looks a little like a futuristic metal and glass rubix cube.As i said earlier, this film is high on my recommending list. The only thing holding it away from ten stars for me, is the choice of characters to kill, i would have chosen differently. The other problem of course with this film is that anytime you are filming in a completely glass set, the crew are going to be seen either in reflections or through the walls, and there is more than enough of these mistakes to be found in this movie.

The twists that exists are very predictable. My rating covers the whole story and for more details i can only add that the movie sucks. The only thing worth-watching in the movie is the house aka machine. Overall if you don't want to ruin your day or night DON'T WATCH THE MOVIE.

I wanted to turn over from the first ten minutes or so, but managed to see it through.Also, in general, what has happened to horror these days. Film makers used to churn out brilliant films week in week out (The Excorcist and Don't Look Now in the same year tells the story).

He was a really well thought out character. With the ghosts being released at the end, I am definitely sure that there wont be a sequel to this. But if there was and it could hold up stronger than this one, and use the same family, I think it would be a great one. I personally wouldn't classify this movie as a sci-fi film, but due to the reluctant ghosts, you will probably see it air on sci-fi a couple times. If you are into ghosts movies, you should watch this. It is worth your while. The acting is great. It really holds up. Not your average ghosts film.

Don't get me wrong I adore horror movies, but recently it seems they have been lacking. A lot of people associate horror movies with bad acting and bad special effects. However special effects packed 13 Ghosts might be, it still had the worst acting I have seen in a film with that kind of budget. Actors who have had decent roles in the past, such as Tony Shelhoub and Matthew Lillard, come up short in the sickening stereotyped roles of the strung out, overworked widower and the goofy likeable ""dork"" who saves the day, respectively. And lets not forget the sassy black nanny for comic relief! If you want to see this movie i would suggest arriving about 15 to 20 minutes late and then leaving 5 minutes early. Its very similar to Hause On Haunted Hill in which it has truck loads of potential but for the most part it comes up soggy and underdeveloped. It's obvious not much work was spent on the storyline and setting up the plot takes entirely too much time, only to be let down by a cheesy let's-all-hug-and-go-home ending. Not to mention the few strands of storyline that end up not even explained at all (i.e. the silver torches, the whole Cyrus thing, the ghost of the mother etc...). Over all the heart of the movie is great eye candy and there are some okay (and I do mean okay) scares.

I couldn't stop noticing the pathetic screenplay and lame performances by the actors as the cast itself, a horrible direction and as worst, an extremely predictable and cliché sequence of events.But I just tried harder and finally got open my eyes to see it. By time the climax started approaching, I really started changing my posture, and It really got me awake -since I was only not sleeping because of the constant and systematic ghost-strikes-.But when I was just about to declare it acceptable, the worst came. It was just so clear that they had run out of budget, and just ended it up. Things got messy and simplified, the end was already known 15 minutes before, the story became worst than ever, and everything started rushing in a brute manner. The prohibited romance, the return of the nanny, the heroic father as the noble siquic are just a few examples of this.I can only admit with shame that it has a really outstanding sound edition, since I was asleep most of the film.

The scariest thing about the film is the fact that it ever got made!Steve Beck, a former ILM effects art supervisor turns his hand to direction, with banal and cliched consequences. Though the film tries desperately to shock and disturb, it falls painfully short of the mark. This type of survival horror has been done before and done a lot better. On the up side, the set design and construction is impressive as the giant machine of a house shifts its walls and doors like a labyrinth, but from the moment you see that the house is almost entirely glass, you just know there will be a cliched explosive ending that will see many panes of glass vomiting shards in slow motion; and guess what? You'd be right.Even the strong and somewhat talented cast cannot redeem this film from video bin hell. The ever great Tony Shalhoub is wasted as the heartbroken father who has typically lost his wife under very painful circumstances. Embeth Davidtz who we last saw in Bridget Jones's Diary is pitifully unconvincing as the token Lara Croft clone no matter how many explosives she packs in her bag. The undeniably talented Matthew Lillard shines as best he can given such a weak script and, due to his recent choices, does make you wonder if he is just repeating the ""Wing Commander"" incident for a laugh. Shannon Elizabeth fills the cliched screaming daughter role quite well, but it doesn't take much talent to fall over and scream a lot so don't expect anything more than her usual superficial performance.On the whole this film looks like it will blissfully fade into obscurity in the bargain bins of your local video store in no time.

'Bobby' is also a great actor, especially considering his age.The story is interesting, original, and the glass house is amazing. It definitely deserves more than the rubbishy two stars it got!

297,rw2,Great visuals with an above average plot,10,5 February 2003,"I see that most people aren't nearly as fond of this one as I am, so I feel compelled to write why I *did* like it.First, the visuals were really good.   Many thrillers have to avoid showing detail about the villains because details end up being fake looking or difficult.  This is one of several reasons why so many take place at night. Thir13en Ghosts works around that by giving the protagonists special glasses which allow them to see the ghosts.  It's a lot less goofy than seeing it written in this review makes it sound and it means that the movie doesn't have to be shot in the depths of night.Second, the story was up to the task and original.  I'll not dwell on this too much as the story centers around the house and the house is one of the main characters in the movie, but suffice it to say I was pleased with the twists.This one isn't going to win any awards, but it's a really solid film for it's genre.",Thir13en Ghosts

I do agree w/some of the comments made by people that didn't like this movie.  The only thing that really bothered me though was the fact that they didn't let you have any background information on most of the ghosts.  I think that would have made this movie a lot better, for me atleast.  But, like I said...I did like it.  It really freaked me out.  I live in a really old house that already has a personality of its own...(it's not like it's haunted...it just has a feeling to it). Not only did I tell my friend at one point in the movie that I didn't want to watch anymore b/c I was so on edge, but, when I got home, I turned on every light in the house.  Even now, over a week later, I'm still checking behind me when I leave a darkened room. Anyway...  I thought the effects were great...and I think I mostly liked it b/c I was just looking to get scared...I wasn't expecting great acting or a plot w/o some holes (though I atleast wanted something better than JeepersCreepers where all I wanted to do was strangle the characters)",Thir13en Ghosts

This picture is bland and uninteresting, featuring a convoluted plot that makes little sense and fails to suspend disbelief.  Here is a movie  whose directing and script-writing makes even a likable bit part player like Tony Shaloub into a hard-to-stomach star.

I didn't get any of the back story with that viewing as i didn't turn the movie on until the majority of the characters were in the library.I watched it again about 2 weeks ago and it didn't really scare me as much as it creeped me out. I still find myself lying in bed at night thinking how terrible it would be to be attacked/chased by something you can't see.Although this isn't an original movie, it was still one of the most inventive movies I've ever seen. In a world where it seems every movie is a carbon-copy of the last big box office hit, this was actually a breath of fresh air. It's not often that i get scared, or even startled, by horror movies, but this one definitely did the job.Special effects were great, story was great, there were a lot of inventive ghosts, ways to show those ghosts, and ways for the characters to meet their deaths.Although i would of liked a better back-story for how those ghosts met their respective fates as living beings, as I had to look up those stories on the internet. I would of also liked to see more of the different ghosts. All the killing/scaring was done by 3-4 different ghosts instead of balancing it between all 11 of the 'evil' spirits.Overall, it's actually one of my favorite movies of all time. I searched for this movie since the night i saw the ending of it on television and didn't find it until about a week ago.

If each lever releases one ghost, why would they need 12 levers when they're in the same room to begin with...  BLOOPER!  But really, this movie is cool and what I think makes it cool is because in most horror films the ghosts are computer animated and added in later.  In THIS movie, they're right on the set with the actors!  That makes in interesting.  Great special effects and actors.

The Sixth Sense), this movie was cliché, poorly written, and had numerous plot holes. Actually, it didn't seem like there was much of a plot at all. Syrus, was a 1 dimensional character, almost a cartoon, and very out of place with the modern day family. And while the special effects were cool at times, (in my opinion) special effects do not make a movie. Trapped in one house for the majority of the movie could have provided a very creative opportunity for the writers and directors, however it was not taken advantage of. The actions were all repetitive...yes, we understand that ghosts can't get through glass with spells written on them, and yes, we see that the ghosts (for some unknown reason) are very violent towards the family...no need to spend 2 hours reviewing! If you want to see a horror movie that takes advantage of being in one house the whole movie that isn't a waste of time I recommend the Shining (although I have to admit that the book was better...it always is).

But, omitting that--yeah, i know it's hard to omit that a movie labeled as ""horror"" is not scary--, i judge it as a very interesting film. The production design is great; the glass house is a state of the art, away from your typical haunted house, looking both luxurious and somehow creepy at the same time. That innovation, carried out with such a splendid result, is worth my applause. So is the decision to make the ghosts be real actors in the set, not digital freaks. Human monsters, even if having to go through 4+ hours of make-up sessions, even if having to use a double amputee actor to play a particular ghost, are the film's best trump card.

When I came to see the movie I expected it to have a frightful intro (which it did have in the junk yard), and for it to be non-stop scary (which it lacked more times than needed). But I loved the way Ben Moss(JR Bourne) lived up to his character. This guy is a great actor, and i really enjoyed his playing through out the film. And not to forget the totally incredible special effects - oh man, once you see these you will fall on the floor, they are spectacular! - along side the 12 ghosts (you guys are going to love the Jackal (Shayne Wyler) and the Juggernaut (John DeSantis). I think they were the best acted out ghosts). On another note, the movie was kind of short (only an hour and 28 minutes), it would have helped if they added an extra 30 minutes of story line).

Although replete with magic spells and satanic schemes it's not the kind of movie that revels in explicit, unrelenting cruelty (like, Se7en or Hellraiser, for instance). Writers Robb White and Neal Stevens give us smart, likeable characters to root for and everybody's got a fighting chance.

I had previously thought Jeepers Creepers was the industry standard in bad film-making but this one takes the cake.  The only scary part is that half of hollywood's biggest producers actually shelled out the money for this movie.

I do have to say the rest of the acting left a bit to be desired, but I went to see the ghosts. With that in mind, I would have also liked to see a bit of history in pertaining to the 12 ghosts (or at least 11 of them, we know about number 4).  Who were they, how were they caught?  I also would have liked to see the other ghosts in action, more than just the Jackal and the Juggernaut, the rest didn't do much.  The movie over all was good, but it could have been better, much better.  There was a lot of building the writers could have done on it.

I found myself more than once durring the movie, literally on the edge of my seat, with a death-grip on the arm-rests. Filming this movie in a totally constructed set on location was impressive and the new look of terror, surrounded by clean lines and classical elements, made this movie more than just a victorian, cob-web ridden creep fest. I think that what some people fail to realize about this film isn't that it's the ghosts that are meant to scare you the most (although, they are fantastically frightening) but the fear of the impending unknown. It's the suspense that thrills and chills. This movie is bound to step out of the realm of the atempted, but failed remake, and into a life all it's own. see it now, in theatres, and be ready for the unexpected!",Thir13en Ghosts
345,kblaser,Fun if you like cheesy - wasted time if you don't,3,23 September 2009,"I love cheesy horror movies, and cheesy this certainly is. It played out a lot like a Sy-Fy channel original movie. (Though I must confess, I enjoy watching those as well.) The writing was bad, the acting was bad (except, of course, for Tony Shalhoub) and the make up was definitely spotty. These faults distracted from any actual thrills that might have made it through, but as it was, I didn't scream once. I did, however, laugh quite a bit. I'm not complaining - it was what I expected from the film, and it delivered.Briefly touching on the subject of Tony Shalhoub, as bad as this movie was, it only made me appreciate Shalhoub more. I loved him in Galaxy Quest, and of course he's brilliant in Monk. For him to actually manage to get his acting skills across despite the writing and lack of support from the rest of the cast is a tribute to his greatness. It was like watching a real person surrounded by a troupe of bad actors. He was the only person to draw me into the story for any amount of time.""Thir13en Ghosts"" is a good flick for a few laughs with friends, but don't expect a serious horror film.",Thir13en Ghosts
346,esornire,"blood, guts, and a horrible ending - semi spoilers",7,8 November 2001,"13 Ghosts is definitely a movie for those of you who like the cheesy horror slasher genre.  The ghosts themselves are beyond awesome, the house is amazing in design and function, and the few death scenes are extraordinarily vivid and grotesque (to my delight).  The acting is also fairly decent for a movie of this type.  Matthew Lillard stands out with a character that, despite having his trademark goofy voice, is rather endearing.  I'd recommend this movie for the special effects alone.  I have three complaints about the movie, however.  Number 1 -  for a slasher movie, not enough people die.  In my opinion, when more people survive than die, it is not a true horror film.  Number two - Shannon Elizabeth is stupid and she doesn't die!!!  Number 3 - the last half an hour of the movie completely devalued the first hour and a half.  In short, the ending sucked.  So I'd recommend you rent this movie, watch it up until the stupid part where Lillard and the WINGS dude are absurdly carrying around a wall from one of the rooms, and then turn the movie off.  Because it all goes downhill from there.  It's not a bad horror flick, but it could have been a pretty good one had the producers not spent all the money on special effects and let the plot lag.",Thir13en Ghosts

An extremely weak plot surrounding a family that has allegedly gone through the massive loss of losing the mother and wife of Arther Criticus (Shalhoub) and his two children. The children seem mis-cast with Shannon Elizabeth as an older sister to Alec Roberts who looks 20 years her junior and their appearance during the film is somewhat brief with them both dissapearing with no explanation for most of the second half of the film, only to reappear together trapped in the giant gyroscope of the machine. These factors didn't get me on the families side, so it was hard to feel scared for them when they were being chased by the 12 ghosts. The machine / house although very well designed had a similar feel to that of the Cube in the film of the same name, but only 10% of the suspense. On the plus side, the effects and general look and feel of the film were well done, its a shame the edit seemed to lose any suspense, tension, fear and story that may have existed when this film was devised.",Thir13en Ghosts

The ride can begin. You get to see a great special effects, thrilling action and scary as hell moments in the following 90 minutes. The ghosts look really wiered but not bad, like in b-movies. The makeup and special effects are great and I don't think it is possible to sit in your seat without at least some higher heartbeat in some moments. The actors do a more less good job, altough I did not like the small boy who is just annoying.

The cast gives great performances, including Shannon Elizabeth and Mathew (Scream, Scooby Doo) Lillard. All the ghosts in the film are amazingly terrifying and they look awesome, and talk about a breathtaking house, man this all glass mansion that the ghosts inhabit sure is a beauty in a horrific twisted way.

352,mistress_of_sin_78,I got more than I bargained for..,10,21 February 2002,"Let's face it, really brilliant horror movies have lately been a rare thing. Well not anymore. I went to see this movie ""13 Ghosts"" with no expectations-other than to be a bit scared, a bit entertained and a bit disappointed. I was none of those. I was really scared, very entertained and very content with what I was seeing. The movie starts with an action sequence that nails you right to your seat.The rest of the movie is like a roller coaster ride in a haunted house.Ok, maybe the plot development had some little flaws. The movie explains very little, so the viewers have to make their own deductions.The director could have given some hints to the viewer and not leave us guessing in more than one occasion. What ever disturbed me (gaps in the plot) was soon forgot as the movie played on. 13 Ghosts has the nastiest looking ghosts I've seen in a long time. The special effects were excellent and the whole house was created beautifully. Good actors can make any less than brilliant movie seem brilliant, and that was the case with this movie too. Matthew Lillard has his own style of acting, that sometimes is more irritating than good, but here he fits in like a shoe. The rest of the cast was also brilliant (F.Murray Abraham is always good). It's been a long time since I ran home from the movies and was scared to death in a dark hallway. I did both after seeing this movie.",Thir13en Ghosts
353,fritz_316,A Severely Lacking horror movie,1,23 April 2002,"""Thir13een Ghosts"" really only exceeds in one area: that it's just another addition of the list of cheesy movies with numbers incorporated into the title (see: Murd3r 8y Num83rs).  This hasn't been clever since ""Se7en"", which fits because this movie is anything BUT clever or original.The movie is about a family on the rocks following the tragic death of their mother.  Now in seeming financial ruin, they are surprised with the announcement of a death of their estranged Uncle, who has bequeathed upon them a new but strange house.  And this is where the family meets with the dreaded ghosts....First off, the movie is genuinly ""jumpy"" in some scenes.  There were slight moments of suspense, but all finished with no real payoff.  There were moments where I jumped, but thats not the same as scared.  If you flash a picture of a cow smiling in front of me, i might jump too, especially if it's accompanied by flashy strobe lights and loud static and screams. Anyone can make you jump with a lot of trick editing and loud noises.  The scares were totally left to the work of the editor, which says something about the story itself.  Some of the ghost are kind of cool, but you can tell that they set forth to think of like six really cool ghosts, and then settled for a couple other filler-ghosts, and some silly characters.  And the cool ghosts are just disgusting looking, not scary.  To make something as disgusting as possible does not equal scary (see:Halloween's Mike Meyers).Now for the Acting.  To put it politely, it was come of the worst I've seen in a looong time.  Matthew Lillard is usually crappy, and he succeeds again here.  Note:Spit Bubbles and wide-mouth expressions do not equal great acting.  They equal drugged-up mental patient.  Also Shannon Elizabeth is reeeally bad here.  She is the most pointless character, and she also succeeds in being completely useless.  She has the corniest lines ever, all delivered with the same wide mouthed smile and pig-tails.  She is absurdly annoying and stupid here, words simply cannot explain.   Tony Shalhoub and F. Murray Abraham are too good for this movie, and are scraping the bottom of the barrel for a paycheck here.  And don't even get me started on Rah Digga's acting debut as the family's sassy black nanny.  First off, the family is supposed to be poor and struggling, yet they can afford a nanny. Also, beware stereotypical sassy-black-women lines.  They are here in abundance, and they are seemingly unaware of how dated and unfunny and racist this character is.  And no, I haven't forgotten the young son, but I'm trying too, as will you after viewing this movie.  You will forget about him halfway through this movie, and seemingly so does his family, sort of like the younger sister in ""Family Matters"".  Oh yeah, she was there.So, in conclusion, this is a not at all impressive ""remake"" of a Hollywood Horror ""Classic"".  Make no mistake, this ""classic"" horror film is about as classic as ""House on Haunted Hill"" was...which means it wasn't. Hollywood throws the word 'classic' around like its nothing, and this is the case here.  This movie will have you shaking your head and laughing at some points, it is that bad and unintentionally.  However if you liked ""House on Haunted Hill"" you will probably enjoy yourself here.  Full of flashy editing, gross-out ""scares"", and some gore, ""Thir13een Ghosts"" is just another addition to the growing list of forgetful horror movies who place amount of blood-spilled and gory-ness of the wounds way higher on the totem pole than the story or acting.",Thir13en Ghosts

Although I'm not a ""horror"" film fan I do like a good suspense and shock film, if intelligently presented or just plain entertaining.This however is none of these things.Surely a requirement of a horror film is to actually SCARE you, right? Why is it then that not one scene in this film is geared towards doing that. True, some of the ghosts antics might make you go ""ewww"" in mild disgust, but it's all handled so poorly you find yourself switching off 15 minutes into the film.It's a crying shame because the actual plot is a great one - some mad old nut traps ghosts in his house in order to power some diabolical machine. Sounds good on paper and the machine and house itself actually looks great on the screen too.But the ghosts weren't the only souless things in the building, where on earth did they drag-up such a ""dumb and dumber"" cast? I was actually rooting for the little kid to get sliced. Some of the ghosts look like they could be truly terrifying given a chance but what do we get? Some nutcase with a cage on his head slashing around for a bit and a naked ""Carrie"" covered in lipstick (sorry, slash wounds). The interesting looking ones do very little other than stand and watch the cast try and flee from them.All in all I can't actually think of a single good thing to the film. It has just 1 twist to the plot which in itself is quite predictable, truly average effects, no scares whatsoever, dull acting and a dull ending.Has to be one of the only movies I've ever seen where I enjoyed watching the trailers before more than the actual movie.",Thir13en Ghosts

Actually, Thir13en Ghosts reminded me of one of my favourite films, The Cube. But that's just the reason I can't give a lot of points for this movie - there are better B-movies with which to entertain yourself. Cube-films sum up the better parts of the film and dispense with boring love-issues.

I saw this movie because I liked the original and thought (naively) that with today's special effects, this movie could be something. And it was something - a flagrant waste of my money. First off, it was not scary. Somebody ran out of ideas in the creation department and though, ""Shucks, we can't have this be like the original, but nobody likes creativity anymore. I know! Lets just throw around vast quantities of blood and have a naked female ghost running around!"" Let me say this to whoever thought that: Go look through the classifieds because you need a new line of work. Blood and gore does not equal scary.Point two: By the end of the movie, myself and the rest of the audience were rooting for the ghosts. When Cyrus was thrown into his own machine, there were universal groans - we had all hoped that it would have been one of those annoying kids. I'll be honest, I couldn't blame Cyrus for wanting to toss his nephew into the Eye of Hell, the thought occurred to me a few times during the movie.Third point: For those of us who can read Latin, I was not amused. I swear (though nobody would pause the movie for me) that one of the glass panels read ""Semper ubi sub ubi"" (and apparently somebody else saw it, too).Point four: People, write a comedy or write a horror movie, don't try both. Comic relief is a good thing but come on, having the day saved by Rah Digger's mad DJ skillz?! What was that? Conclusion: I kept hoping that this movie would get better (alas, twas in vain). Instead, it was like a trainwreck - I wanted to look away but my masochistic side wouldn't permit it. I beg you! Spare yourselves! It would have been a much more pleasant movie if a car in the junkyard had fallen on Matthew Lillard instead of Cyrus.

It makes you sick to the back teeth because it's just that bad, or it makes you twitch every time you see in the paper that Thir13en Ghosts is on. I, myself, fall into the latter category. I loved every second of this film! I saw this a few weeks back, I was bored and I was flicking stations on TV. Luckily, the film was only just starting. The scrapyard scene had me hooked. One downside to this was that Cyrus Kriticos (F. Murray Abraham) got killed off quite quickly. I would have liked to see a little more about his past, but then that would be trailing from the path of this story. Notwithstanding, the very feel that this film gave me was astounding. The makeup on all the ghosts had me looking away at times. I thought it quite strange that the ghost we saw the most of was naked to the eye, there should have been a bit of camera-share there. As we are really starting to get into this story, we find out that Kalina (Embeth Davidtz), the woman who is also trapped in the house, is actually helping the ghost of Cyrus. A small problem there, is he dead or not? He had a chunk of metal wrapped around his neck, yet he can be seen without the ghost-seeing glasses. Perhaps it's just me, I may have had my fingers clasped around my eyes.Brilliant film, I completely recommend this for anyone who wants a good fright and some small laughs.",Thir13en Ghosts
374,kellys-62099,It's not as bad as I thought,8,19 October 2020,"I think the worst part of the movie is the casting choice. The age gap between the daughter and the son is hard to get over. Also, how are they ""so poor"" yet they have a nanny? Especially when the daughter looks about 20.The horror is mostly bloody and gorey images. Overall, I enjoyed the movie.",Thir13en Ghosts

377,BrandonKyleFerguson,Hasn't aged well,6,29 July 2017,"I first saw this movie as a child back in 2007, six years after it's release. Back then I was so amazed at the level of creativity that this movie had offered. So many interesting and unique details were depicted which made it stand out quite well compared to other horror movies.It has now been 16 years since its release, and after just watching it again, I can plainly say that this movie has not aged well at all. In fact, watching it now was sort of a pain. The story was still intriguing, but the actual 'ghosts' look so boring and not very well designed, with the exception of a couple and even they are a bit lackluster. The acting isn't anything exceptional, but it works. If you were a new viewer and weren't informed of the time period of this movies release, you would quickly realize that it was released during the very early 2000's.The story is okay. A band of people are placed in a situation they didn't want or expect to be in and are trying to find a way to leave it with their lives. Sounds somewhat typical, but it does it decently well. The one major complaint I have is that the movie never addresses how the ghosts died, which is a question that I find most people as well as myself are left wondering. Final Thoughts: This movie worked during the time of it's release, but it doesn't work as well now. The impact of time has made it unfortunately a bit difficult to view. You won't be totally left unfulfilled investing an hour and a half watching this, but just know that it won't keep up with today's standards of a horror movie.",Thir13en Ghosts
378,ukfay_ooyay,It's the mythology,10,12 October 2006,"This movie is as bad as any other horror movie with it's plot holes, suspect character decisions, and poor acting. That said, there are three things that make this movie worth your time. One, the setting is unique, and allows for many interesting visuals. Two, Mathew Lilliard and F. Murray Abraham are cool. And three, most importantly, the mythology of the Black Zodiac. The movie doesn't explain it well, and doesn't necessarily honor what they do explain, but the names are awesome, the hinted story is cool, and the impression is given that more information is out there. It's fun to think of ""celebrity"" ghosts. Ghosts of people who are such a personification of an idea, that they fill an occult archetype. It creates a sense of dread when you hear ""the Juggernaught"" is coming that is not based on anything other than what the movie itself created. Watch it.",Thir13en Ghosts
