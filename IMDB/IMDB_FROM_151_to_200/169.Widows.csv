0,TheLittleSongbird,"Capable of greatness, left as very good",8,26 November 2018,"'Widows' quickly became one of the my most anticipated films of the latter half of 2018. It is hard to go wrong with such a sterling cast, most with great performances under their belt. Having Steve McQueen, of '12 Years a Slave' (not everybody liked that film, highly appreciated it personally) fame, directing and 'Gone Girl' (love both book and film) author Gillian Flynn penning the script also promised a lot, as well as some great ideas.On the most part, 'Widows' was a very good film and of the five films seen in the cinema in the past week (the others being 'Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald', 'The Grinch', 'The Girl in the Spider's Web' and 'Robin Hood') it was by far the best of the five. Not for everybody, with a measured pace and a lot going on subplots and character--wise, but for me it kept me engrossed right from its violent and hard-hitting opening sequence. At the same time, 'Widows' disappointed slightly, because it was capable of greatness. Most of it actually was great and it very nearly became one of my favourite films of the year, even though not perfect it still is in the better half with that being said, just a few things brought it down.Its biggest fault was the final 25-30 minutes, which actually strictly speaking should have been the most exciting part of the film. Instead this portion of the film felt very rushed, strained credibility, was reliant on too convenient coincidences and ended too patly with things left in the air. The resolution of the big twist, which won't be spoiled, was particularly underwhelming.That to me was pretty much the only majorly wrong thing, though also thought the sparsely used (a good choice actually) music was pretty forgettable and the political subplot was not as compelling or as meaty as the others, somewhat undercooked.However, it is remarkable that 'Widows' had as many characters, subplots and themes as it did and it still managed to be as engrossing as it was. Although others will disagree, with there being complaints of incoherence and trying to do too much (didn't find that personally, and the latter has been a recurring issue in some films seen recently), 'Widows' didn't feel over-stuffed and it wasn't confusing to me. While deliberate, the pace didn't feel that slow, because the meaty character writing in very much a character-driven film and how adeptly a vast majority of the subplots were done were so well done. Also the length did not bother me, at just over two hours, compared to quite a number of films that actually is not that long, so the overlong complaint is puzzling. There was some good suspense and a few nice unexpected twists. The dialogue is tight and really crackles in the best moments, also provoking much thought and having a lot to say about its heavy and relevant themes (like the connection between money and power) done insightfully and without preaching.McQueen's direction is very much bravura in quality, not as brutal as in '12 Years a Slave' (which is a different film), though there are brutal moments, but it is every bit as honest and punchy. The production values, particularly the photography, are slick and stylish, with many audacious touches like the car-bonnet mounted shot.As far as the acting goes, that is one of the areas where 'Widows' most excels, containing some of the best ensemble acting of the year. Viola Davis' powerhouse performance, intense yet soulful, is the one that dominates but there are particularly superb performances from Elizabeth Debicki, one to watch, and Daniel Kaluuya at his most chilling. Brian Tyree Henry also sports creepy moments. Colin Farrell gives one of his best performances since 'In Bruges', Liam Neeson is charismatic in his relatively short screen time and Robert Duvall is great value. The biggest surprise here was McQueen getting a good performance out of Michelle Rodriguez, shying away from her trademark tough girl image and who has never been better. Loved the dog too.Summarising, very good and nearly great, it would have been the latter if the last half an hour or so was as good as the rest of the film and wasn't a let down. 8/10 Bethany Cox",Widows
1,SnoopyStyle,simplicity would be better,6,2 February 2019,"In Chicago, Veronica (Viola Davis) becomes a widow when her husband Harry Rawlings (Liam Neeson) is killed while stealing $2M from ruthless criminals Jamal Manning (Brian Tyree Henry) and Jatemme Manning (Daniel Kaluuya). The Manning brothers want their money back from Veronica. Jatemme is running for office against equally corrupt politician Jack Mulligan (Colin Farrell) who is following in his father Tom Mulligan (Robert Duvall)'s footstep. Harry has left behind a notebook with his next target and Veronica decides to hit it with the other widows from Harry's job, Linda (Michelle Rodriguez) and Alice (Elizabeth Debicki). In need of a driver, Linda recruits her friend Belle (Cynthia Erivo).I really don't like the start. The first act is essentially introducing the Mannings and Mulligan with their political rivalry. It'd be fine if the movie is about them but it should be about the women. One of the themes of the story is that the women are dismissed as secondary people and the movie starts off by treating them as secondary characters. It is a bad start. Once they get going with the ladies, the movie gets better. I really like their stories. There is a big twist reveal but it comes way too early. The Mannings and Mulligan rivalry may be important but really unnecessary for the women. This would be a much more compelling story if it gets streamlined and concentrated on the ladies. Director Steve McQueen has great skills but sometimes simplicity is better. This is about the women and not about the men.",Widows
2,boblipton,I Enjoyed This One,7,15 July 2020,"When Liam Neeson and his entire crew is killed while pulling a robbery, his widow, Viola Davis, is told by the criminal boss who's running for alderman, that she has to come up with the money. The only asset she has is Neeson's carefully worked out plans for his next job...only she doesn't know where it is. She contacts the widows of her husband's partners and proposes they carry out the robbery.It's a beautifully acted, tough heist film with a lot of dirty politics in the foreground, as the family of old Irish politicians struggle to maintain their seats in a newly redrawn district. Director Steve McQueen is the hot director over the last few years, and he has turned out an exciting movie.",Widows
3,Horst_In_Translation,A good movie that sadly almost never reaches greatness,6,15 December 2018,"Took director Steve McQueen five years approximately to come up with a new full feature film after his Best Picture winner ""12 Years a Slave"" and here we have said project. He got help from GG-nominated Gillian Flynn, writer of Gone Girl, with the script here in adapting British Emmy-nominated writer Lynda La Plante's original work. Unlike McQueen's previous, this is not a film that is about race, even if there are minor references at times and it is not too surprising that McQueen got a fairly African-American cast here with the likes of Viola Davis, Daniel Kaluuya and others in key roles. But there also pretty familiar Caucasian faces in here like Liam Neeson, Colin Farrell, Robert Duvall and Elizabeth Debicki. It is a pretty long movie at over 2 hours, but it also deals with several story lines and really many characters, so it should not be that surprising really. I heard there's talks about Davis possibly scoring another Oscar nomination here, but I don't think she was good enough for that, even if she has a baity moment here and there like the scenes when she is missing her man or also the crying scene early on. Glad to see Debicki received a critics awards recently as I thought she was very good with a pretty challenging character, maybe even the MVP of the entire movie. So much for the cast. Now for the two story lines, I liked one more than the other, namely the one that involved politics and an upcoming Chicago election between a Black and a White candidate and the different directions it took from start to end of the film. To me, this felt more interesting than the girls' idea to get the money criminally that they need to pay their dues or make a fortune with all the money. But this one wasn't too bad either in my opinion, just slightly inferior to the other. How the final robbery then decides said election is just the icing on the cake and seeing how Farrell's character acts towards Duvall's throughout the film, I am sure he got along well with that, even if he still has respect for the old man, for example listens to him when he says to talk to Davis' character immediately.There is one major plot twist in here and that involves Neeson's character. Well, I am not sure how realistic it seemed, but it sure showed us how much of a professional Neeson's character was, so also makes it a bit difficult to believe how foolishly he got killed by his (ex-)wife towards the end. Or how she and the others also all of a sudden take care of Kaaluya's character really as if they were total pros with one of them beieng pretty heavily injured. Oh well, I think Neeson's reaction and weakness can be explained through the sighing that he still realizes she is his wife, but there is no other option than killing her. Davis' character said on one occasion throughout the film that she cannot deal with all the brutality and that felt realistic and accurate and not how she and her amateur gang take out one antagonist after the next. Final shot was pretty good though with her meeting Debicki's character again, even if the library funding idea felt really too altruistic to be honest. Okay what else can be added? I think I gave the same rating to this film like to McQueen's previous far better movie and I think both are decent, but not great. This one we got here is a decent crime blockbuster (you can call it that) that has Kaluuya as the bad guy this time, not the one and only good guy almost, and good scenes involve Debicki's. Neeson's ""I know"" at the end was pretty good too and probably 3 or 4 other good moments like when we see Neeson's character is alive, which came out of nowhere, but the dog barking and Davis understanding immediately explain the situation very well. Good writing there from the author. Yes maybe the film could have been 10 minutes shorter, maybe 15 even, but it is not guaranteed they really cut out the weaker scenes then. For example the bowling alley scene was not too great, just violent with little sake for the story. Pretty nice though for fans of Justified and Raising Hope to see a familiar face here, that kind of actor where you always recognize him, but rarely remember the name. Well here it is for you: Garret Dillahunt. One I did not mention yet is Oscar nominee Jacki Weaver, but she is barely in it though. And Cynthia Erivo who has some screen time in the second half, but probably played the least memorable character from the entire movie who has a decent amount of screen time and honestly she could have been left out completely. Minor weaknesses here, but all in all this film is definitely worth checking out I think and it is not even a close call. I had a pretty fun time watching here. Go see it, especially if you like some of the cast.",Widows
4,Prismark10,Widows,5,5 October 2019,"This film version is based on the ITV series from 1983 that was written by Lynda La Plante.In Chicago, Harry Rawlings (Liam Neeson) heist has gone wrong. His gang is killed and he is burned to a cinder when stealing two million dollars from a ruthless gangster Jamal Manning (Brian Tyree Henry) who is also running for political office. He is running against smarmy upstart Jack Mulligan (Colin Farrell) who is corrupt just like his father Tom Mulligan (Robert Duvall) who is stepping down from politics due to ill health.Jamal and his brother Jatemme Manning (Daniel Kaluuya) put pressure on Harry's widow Veronica (Viola Davis) to liquidate all her assets and pay them back.Harry has left behind a notebook with plans for his next job. Veronica teams up with the other widows from her late husband's gang to pull off the heist and pay off the Mannings. The Mannings are after the notebook as well.Steve McQueen has gone for a muscular reworking set in Chicago but it also becomes flabby with too many right on messages ranging from political corruption, female exploitation to a racist cop needlessly killing a young black man. The political angle was overkill and got in the way of the main story, at times making the widows secondary characters in their own movie.Having seen the original series of Widows when it was broadcast. It was a trailblazer, a heist film featuring women and written by a woman with a big plot twist. The remake maintains the twist but is nowhere as good as the original show.",Widows
5,nogodnomasters,It's Wallpaper,4,3 December 2018,"The film starts off with a robbery that ends in an inferno. No more crooks, other than the politicians running for office on the south side of Chicago. Jack Mulligan (Colin Farrell) is part of a connected family that practices nepotism in awarding construction contracts with kickbacks. He is running against Jamal Manning who is not without fault. The money that was stolen and burned up was two million in cash from the Jamal Manning campaign. He leans on the widow Viola Davis to make up for it.The wives/girlfriends of the robbers decide to do an Ocean's 3 to get the money.The film didn't seem very probable and most the acting was phoned in. I was bored for much of the time. Way too long and too many slow scenes. Robert Duvall could have been left out. Too many stars that didn't shine.Guide: F-word, sex, nudity (Elizabeth Debicki)",Widows
6,kosmasp,Widows assemble,7,7 May 2019,"Some things are very straightforward and predictable from beginning to end. Now I reckon this can be seen in this category by some but others may find themselves suprised at least a couple of times. Having said that and apart from a decent script we have a really nice ensemble of actors in this. The female group is diverse and interesting enough and the dynamic inside that group is quite appealing to say the least.I guess this can be seen as feminist, but it would be a bit of a disservice to just boil it down to that. But it is empowering to women and shows quite a few sides of them (not all positive, as it should be no matter the gender). Cliches aside, the overall package is entertaining enough to enjoy it",Widows
7,lee_eisenberg,taking on corruption,9,11 March 2019,"I heard some about Steve McQueen's ""Widows"" when it got released but only loosely understood the plot. Now that I've seen it, I determine that addresses not only grief, but also corruption. As the title characters find out, both candidates running for alderman are equal slimeballs, pandering for votes but aiming only to serve themselves.But beyond that, it's one intense movie. Viola Davis, Michelle Rodriguez, Elizabeth Debicki and Cynthia Erivo play women hardened by devastation and left with no other options except carrying out the heist. It's not the greatest movie, but I recommend it.",Widows
8,jboothmillard,Widows,8,18 November 2018,"Based on the acclaimed British TV show from the 1980s, there were rumours going about that this film may get recognition during Awards Season, and the trailer for it did look very good, so I looked forward to it, written and directed by Steve McQueen (Hunger, Shame, 12 Years a Slave), co-written by Gillian Flynn (Gone Girl). Basically in Chicago, renowned thief Harry Rawlings (Liam Neeson) and his partners Carlos Perelli (Manuel Garcia-Rulfo), Florek Gunner (Jon Bernthal) and Jimmy Nunn (Coburn Goss) are killed in a botched robbery. Harry's wife Veronica (Viola Davis), a teacher's union delegate, is grieving, as are clothing store owner Linda (Michelle Rodriguez), Carlos' wife, and domestic violence victim Alice Gunner (Elizabeth Debicki), Florek's wife. Veronica is threatened by crime boss Jamal Manning (Brian Tyree Henry), the man Harry and his partners stole $2 million from. Manning wants the money to finance his electoral campaign for alderman of a South Side precinct, he is running against Jack Mulligan (Colin Farrell), son of the incumbent former politician Tom Mulligan (Robert Duvall). Veronica discovers a notebook left by Harry, containing a detailed plan of his next heist, she decides to carry out this plan to get Jamal's money back. She recruits two of the other widows, Linda and Alice, to help carry out the robbery, they will steal $2 million to pay Manning, and split the other millions. The fourth widow Amanda Nunn (Carrie Coon), Jimmy's wife, does not show at the initial meeting, Veronica talks to Amanda later and finds out she has a baby, she chooses not to mention the heist plan to her. Alice buys the van at an automobile auction and guns are a trade show that they will need for the job. Linda works on finding the building on the blueprints, but ultimately it is Alice, becoming a professional escort, who finds this out, beginning a sexual relationship with real estate executive David (Lukas Haas), he identifies they are blueprints of Mulligan's house/headquarters. When Veronica's chauffeur Bash O'Reilly (Garret Dillahunt) is murdered by Manning and his brother, mob enforcer Jatemme (Get Out's Daniel Kaluuya), the group require a new getaway driver. Linda eventually recruits her children's babysitter Belle (Cynthia Erivo), hoping that her speed and smarts will be an asset for the job. Veronica visits the Mulligan house to case the premises in advance of the heist, and to ask Jack to help protect her from Manning, he rejects her request, while Belle investigates the external security. The group set out at night to rob the Mulligan house while Jack is at a debate, they manage to knock out the security guard, find the safe and steal all the millions inside. But they are interrupted by Tom, he shoots and wounds Alice, she returns fire and he is killed. They manage to get all the money bags into the van, but the widows are double-crossed by Jamal, his brother Jatemme has been sent to take the money from them. The widows chase after Jatemme until he is run off the road and killed when crashing, they retrieve the money. The group split up and go their separate ways, Belle drives away, Linda takes Alice to hospital, and Veronica returns to the hideout. At the hideout, Veronica is shocked to find Harry, who faked his death and set up his partners, he has arrived to take the money from Veronica to start a new life with Amanda, it is revealed the child she has is his. Harry attacks the emotional Veronica when she refuses, he is about to shoot her dead, but she fires and kills him, sets the hideout on fire and leaves with the money. Jack wins the election on a wave of public sympathy following his father's death. Linda uses her cut to buy back her shutdown clothing store, Alice uses her cut to set up her own business, and Belle moves away with her daughter and gives her boss money to pay off a debt to Jack. Veronica uses most of her share to fund a library project in her deceased son's memory. Veronica and Alice encounter each other in a diner, they initially ignore each other, but Veronica approaches Alice outside and smiles. Also starring Molly Kunz as Siobhan, Michael Harney as Sergeant Fuller, Matt Walsh as Ken and EastEnders' Ann Mitchell (starred in the original TV series) as Amanda's mother. Davis gives a powerhouse performance as the driving force of the crew, she is supported well by Rodriguez, Debicki, and Erivo, Neeson does well with his short time on screen, Farrell is fine, and Henry may be the main villain, but it is Kaluuya who almost steals the show as the highly sinister and threatening henchman. It is a well-crafted story, four women working together to pull off a robbery, the political corruption stuff is okay, but it is the planning and execution of the job that pulls you in most, and the engaging characters, suspense and twists along the way, a thrilling and enjoyable crime drama. Very good!",Widows
9,Quinoa1984,A blast from start to finish,10,25 November 2018,"Seeing this again, I'm convinced this is THE major Michael Mann movie that he didnt make, only driven by women and how in practically every step of their lives, when they're not dealing with loss on one level or another, it's a fight (emotionally and physically) to not be completely dominated by men. It has to be fight since men like, you know, the Robert Duvall character and to an extent Lukas Haas too, rule over all. And every Gillian Flynn scripted twist in the story (and you know she had to have been the one to get those third act OH SHIT moments in there) emphasizes this.This is that perfect kind of cinematic alchemy where it's a tight-as-a-vice crime genre storytelling - theres a lot of detail and what seems like a lot of plot, but it never bogs the actual flow of the story as it needs to be - with a substantive and heart-wrenching drama that uses Chicago as not just another city but a city that involves all of THIS that is happening involving race and gender and above all class inequality (and lest we forget women have to fight or at least subvert themselves from being second class citizens - look at when Jacki Weaver tells her daughter to put up her body for men to use since, well, that's a way to make good money (""and if you're sweet,"" she adds as if completely unaware of her being in this locked-in-step idea of what women can be or do in society).So it's politically alive and socially alive, it doesn't get preachy about it (and if it ever is, it doesnt stop the movie), the cast is across the board fan
tastic, from Viola to Cynthia (what a year shes had huh) to... Lukas Haas look at him in a movie where he gets dialog for once, a star-making turns for Debicki and another notch on Kaluuya's major performances, and Robert Duvall who is still Robert damn Duvall, and it's a sensational and at key points unconventional heist movie.This is all so great a work of what Hollywood is capable of when it gives talented artists room to thrive that it even comes as close as possible to redeeming the plot conceit of The Book of Henry. The BOOK OF HENRY!!!?!?!",Widows
10,searchanddestroy-1,Good drama,7,28 November 2018,"Is it really a thriller, a crime movie or a drama. Well, a little of each. But in the female armed robbers, I highly prefered F Gary Grey's SET IT OFF, made in 1997, starring Queen Latifah. But this one is of course better than the OCEAN 8 crap. and Liam Neeson is for once in an offbeat character for him.",Widows
11,writers_reign,Black Widow,6,12 November 2018,"Frankly I'll pay to see Viola Davis in anything and so far she hasn't let me down. I can't say the same for Steve McQueen, I find directors who get a rep as critics darlings are often overrated and in danger of getting taken up by the Academic-Pseud axis. In spite of these misgivings I did, against my better instincts check out 12 Years A Slave and wasted time I can never get back. Widows, however, is light on pretention and heavy on entertainment - my wife, notoriously hard to please - pronounced it brilliant and while I wouldn't go that far it was easy to take and Davis, as one would expect, carried it expertly.",Widows
12,Calicodreamin,Boring,5,16 September 2021,"Widows was marketed as an action thriller, but it had neither action nor thrills. The characters lacked depth, the storyline was disjointed, and the huge acting potential wasted.",Widows
13,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Commands respect,9,25 November 2018,"Four robbers are killed by the police. Their widows realize that they need money, and fast. Veronica(Davis, determined) has to get 2 million for crime boss Jamal Manning(Tyree Henry, seeking to change careers), from whom that amount was stolen, by her husband - which went up in smoke when the van they were in blew up due to SWAT firing on it. Linda(Rodriguez, worried she'll lose her kids) has to pay off her man's bookies to keep her clothing store. And Alice(Debicki, gradually growing more assertive over the course of this) simply doesn't have many prospects, having not yet gone to college, and hates the job as an escort that she deems to be the only other option.At 2 hours and 9 minutes, the last four of those being end credits by my count, the running time here is about what's expected these days - if this was much longer it would be excessive. Why? This is dense with detail and themes. Some say it simply has too many to give due time to all. Yes, it requires you to watch it very carefully from start to finish to follow it. However, if you can give it that, and you view this through the lens of the theory of intersectional feminism, I would argue that you, too, will find that all of the ideas are connected to each other. It explores political corruption(where did all that money go? Why did beat your opponent if you can intimidate him to give up campaigning?) and nepotism(hiring family to positions), power and its dynamics especially when it comes to race relations(if an African-American is to have any influence it is because someone White graciously lends them some. As long as they still know their place), as well as women's freedom(always tied to responsibilities, even those of other people) and agency(rather than having to rely on the man they're married to). Every one of these elements, in the movie and in real life, affect the others. Be careful not to expect a traditional heist film. I'm not saying those who didn't like it thought it would be Ocean's Eleven. But they may have expected something akin to the excellent Heat, and this is not trying to be that. McQueen's style is distinctly different from Michael Mann's, intentionally so. This is more focused on its ideas than on action. There are a lot of very short scenes, and some characters are (nearly!) given too little time.I recommend this to everyone who cares about social issues. 9/10",Widows
14,view_and_review,When the Goin' Gets Tough,7,7 June 2019,"When four women are widowed all in one night their lives were inexorably altered. If it wasn't bad enough with no husbands and little to no means to support themselves, things would get geometrically worse when they found out that their husbands died stealing from a known drug dealer. How does that affect them? Well, the money was destroyed and now said drug dealer wants it from the widows. Or else...Desperate times call for desperate measures which is why this movie had appeal. What would these women do in the face of such dire circumstances?Widows was an intricate movie. Intricate movies usually have a greater potential of failure due to the many moving pieces. Widows succeeded where others failed. The pieces came together nicely without any noticeable rifts. It helped to have some big names in the movie: Robert Duvall, Liam Neeson, Colin Farrell, Viola Davis, Michelle Rodriguez, Daniel Kaluuya, and Jon Bernthal. If those names don't ring a bell then let's see...The Godfather, Taken, Phone Booth, Fences, Fast and Furious, Get Out, and The Punisher (Netflix series).That's not a bad list of movies (and the one show).Widows isn't a fast-paced movie by any means, but it has a splash of intensity. The setting is modern day Chicago. There is a heavy political tone and a subtler racial tone to the movie. The political tone is unavoidable because Jack Mulligan (Colin Farrell) is running for alderman of the 18th ward. The racial tone is distinct but not nearly as pervasive-unless you consider an interracial couple pervasive. I think what I liked most about the movie, besides the women taking matters in their own hands in an effective more-or-less realistic way, is its similarity to The Wire in some respects. That seedy symbiosis between politics, crime, legit business, and the people that pay the highest price in it all.But, if I had to choose one reason the movie was good I'd have to give it to the ladies. They were excellent in their roles. They were all different, all unique, and all uniquely motivated. I like what they brought. They brought the movie to life.",Widows
15,neil-476,Excellent female-centric thriller,9,22 November 2018,"Harry's crew carries out a heist which goes horribly wrong and they all die, the money they stole being destroyed. Crime boss turned politico Jamal was intending to use the money to fund his political campaign, and makes it clear to Harry's widow Veronica that he expects her to make good his loss, failing which Jamal's psycho enforcer brother will exact retribution. Veronica has Harry's detailed notes for his next job, and sets about recruiting her fellow widows to carry it out.This is essentially a caper movie, with a strong backstory. It's getting a lot of publicity because of direction by Steve (12 Years A Slave) McQueen, and screenwriting by Gillian (Gone Girl) Flynn. Getting less publicity is the fact that it adapts a UK TV series by Lynda LaPlante, albeit the action here is transplanted to Chicago.I have read comments which suggest that, at just over 2 hours, this is rather leisurely. I disagree. The plot is always developing, with a couple of good twists.And the female cast members are excellent. Viola Davis does a wonderful job of conveying a woman who deals with extreme strees by keeping everything else buttoned up tight but, for me, the revelation was Michelle Rodriguez. Having made a career out of playing toughnut Latinas, attractinve but with a hard edge, she here plays a mother no longer in the first flush of youth, left in deep trouble by her husband's death, and having to find strength to do something she never thought she would have to. The combination of weary vulnerability and inner steel is not something I expected to see from Rodriguez.I found this a very satisfying and well-plotted action thriller.",Widows
16,evanston_dad,Feel Bad Movie of 2018,6,7 March 2019,"Good grief, say ""hello"" to the feel-bad movie of 2018.Come to think of it, this film's director, Steve McQueen, also brought us the feel-bad movie of 2013, ""12 Years a Slave."" Does he need to get laid? It's rather ironic that someone named Steve McQueen should have trouble getting laid.Anyway, ""12 Years a Slave"" felt necessary, so at least there was a point to making us all feel bad. We SHOULD all feel bad about something like slavery. But ""Widows"" could have been a slick, entertaining little genre exercise, which is what it's crying out to be, had McQueen and his writers not decided to strive for the Woketopia seal of approval. As it is, they throw in every conceivable issue even remotely related to the treatment of either minorities or women in America, whether or not they organically spring from the material. You name an unfair societal ill perpetuated by white men, and you'll find it in this movie. Though to be fair, African American men don't come off looking much better. This is a movie where all white men are corrupt politicians and all black men are gangster thugs. Meanwhile, all women are victims in some form or other -- cheated on, beaten up, exploited. I knew we were in trouble when, in an early scene, a mom, played by Jacki Weaver as a caricature of a New York mafia moll (despite the fact that we're in Chicago), encourages her daughter to prostitute herself because ""women should be taken care of by men."" And in the tackiest and most exploitative nod to ""wokeness,"" the film throws in a shooting of an unarmed black youth by police. This plot isn't developed in any way, mind you. It's just a footnote tossed in to check off a politically aware box and a cheap tactic to reap the reward of our outrage without having to earn it the hard way.And the movie is just. so. ANGRY. I get that these characters are desperate and that cracking jokes might not be their top priority. But it is possible to make a movie about desperate, humorless people without the movie itself being humorless and surly. The catch is that It takes creativity and a deft touch, which McQueen as a film maker has not yet shown evidence of having.So why did I rate this even as high as I did? Because for all of my complaints, there is quite a bit to like about this movie. Get past its preposterous need to feel relevant and progressive, and the film making itself isn't half bad. McQueen knows how to direct action scenes, and he also knows how to build tension. And the acting throughout is very good, especially from Colin Farrell, Brian Tyree Henry, and Elizabeth Debicki. Viola Davis, who anchors the film, is fine but her character is so one note -- and such a dour one note at that -- that she's not given much opportunity to shine. The only misfire in the acting department comes from, of all people, Robert Duvall, who does his best Uncle Leo from ""Seinfeld"" impression.A wildly uneven movie at best, but not a total wash.Grade: B",Widows
17,ferguson-6,squeezing in every message possible,5,16 November 2018,"Greetings again from the darkness. Woman power. Black power. Racist old white men. Corrupt politicians. Abusive husbands. Cheating white husbands. Racist cops. Men are bad. Women are strong and good. If a filmmaker were to blend all of these stereotypes into a single movie, then as movie goers we should expect an ultra-talented filmmaker like Steve McQueen to go beyond conventional genre. Unfortunately, a nice twist on the heist movie formula from Lynda La Plante's novel turns into predictability that whips us with societal clichés posing as societal insight.I seem to be one of the few not raving about this movie. Hey it has the director behind Best Picture Oscar winner 12 YEARS A SLAVE (Mr. McQueen), a screenplay he co-wrote with Gillian Flynn (GONE GIRL) from the aforementioned novel by Lynda La Plante, and a deep and talented cast of popular actors. It ticks every box and it's likely to be a crowd-pleaser, despite my disappointment. Every spot where I expected intrigue, the film instead delivered yet another eye-roll and easy-to-spot twist with a cultural lesson. Each of the actors does tremendous work, it just happens to be with material they could perform in their sleep.It's the kind of film where audience members talk to the screen - and it plays like that's the desired reaction. This is the 4th generation of the source material, including 3 previous TV mini-series (1983, 1985, 2002). It makes sense that this material would be better suited to multiple episodes, rather than hurried through 2 hours. There are too many characters who get short-changed, and so little time to let the personalities breathe and grow. But this is about delivering as many messages as possible.A strong premise is based in Chicago, and finds a team of four burglars on a job gone wrong. This leaves a mobster/politician looking to the four widows (hence the title) for reparations. Since the women have no money, their only hope is to tackle the next job their men had planned. Viola Davis, Michelle Rodriguez, Elizabeth Debicki, and Carrie Coon play the widows, though only the first three are given much to do, as the talented Ms. Coon is short-changed. In fact, Ms. Davis is such a strong screen presence that she dominates every scene she is in - she's a true powerhouse. Even Liam Neeson can't hang with her. Colin Farrell appears as a smarmy politician and Robert Duvall is his f-word spouting former Alderman dad. Cynthia Erivo has a nice supporting turn in support of the women, and Bryan Tyree Henry, Daniel Kaluuya, Jacki Weaver, Garret Dillahunt, Kevin J O'Connor, Lukas Haas, and Jon Bernthal fill out the deep cast ... see what I mean about too many characters and too little time?There is no single thing to point at as the cause for letdown. The story just needed to be smarter and stop trying so hard to comment on current societal ills. As an example, a quick-trigger cop shooting an innocent young African-American male seems thrown in for the sole purpose of ensuring white guilt and an emotional outburst from the audience. It's difficult to even term this film as manipulating since we see the turns coming far in advance. Two far superior message films released earlier this year are Spike Lee's BLACKKKLANSMAN and Boots Riley's SORRY TO BOTHER YOU. For those who need only emotion and little intellect in their movies, this not-so-thrilling heist might work. For the rest of you, it's good eye-roll practice.",Widows

I couldn't get many of the twists and turns of the story. Key plot elements were rushed or relayed through dialogue instead of visually. What happened with Liam Neeson's character in the end was too far fetched.What kept me watching was the cast.
Viola Davis plays the chief widow an actress who gets sympathy of the viewer. Michelle Rodriguez isn't the badass she usually plays here. Elizabeth Debicki is tall and watchable. Colin Farrell seemed to have done something weird to his hair. Robert Duvall is amazing for late 80s.Despite some themes of female empowerment and racial injustice, this is Not a must watch.",Widows

The result - an engrossing if at times confusingly complex film that places the power of women responding to the crises of deceased criminal husbands in a manner that is rarely seen in cinema. It is larger than monster anime and far more terrifying. - and impressive as a view of female empowerment.A very condensed plot is offered by 20th Century Fox: """"Widows"" is the story of four women with nothing in common except a debt left behind by their dead husbands' criminal activities. Set in contemporary Chicago, amid a time of turmoil, tensions build when Veronica (Viola Davis), Alice (Elizabeth Debicki), Linda (Michelle Rodriguez) and Belle (Cynthia Erivo) take their fate into their own hands and conspire to forge a future on their own terms.""The criminal men include Liam Neeson, Jon Bernthal, Manuel Garcia-Ruffo and Coburn Goss, while the Chicago political/criminal characters are portrayed by Colin Farrell, Robert Duvall, James Vincent Meredith, Brian Tyree Henry, Lukas Haas and a huge supporting cast of excellent actors including stand out performances by Jon Michael Hill as the Reverend and Garret Dillahunt as Bash, the driver for the women's caper.The film's language is as harsh as the subject matter and it fits the film. The four lead actresses are uniformly excellent and the manner in which the repair/revenge of their husbands' shocking activity is powerful.

The movie isn't perfect, far from it, but it is entertaining and that's what I look for when watching a movie in this genre. I expected fast paced action when I saw that Liam Neeson was in it but he actually has a minor role. It's more about the women, like the title is indicating, and they all did a decent good job.

22,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"Meandering, unengaging wannabe masterpiece from Steve McQueen",4,8 May 2019,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningAn armoured vehicle heist leaves a gang of crooks, lead by Harry Rawlings (Liam Neeson) dead, and what they stole falls on their widows to repay. Harry's widow, Veronica (Viola Davis) takes the initiative, and attempts to band together with the other bereaved partners, including Linda (Michelle Rodriguez), Alice (Elizabeth Debicki) and Siobhan (Molly Kane) to pull off the heist that killed their lovers. However, corrupt councillor Jack Mulligan (Colin Farrell) and his father Tom (Robert Duvall) may know more about Harry's real intentions than they can know.Adapted from a 1983 TV mini-series from Britain, riding on from the awards success and cultural impact of 12 Years a Slave, British director Steve McQueen has assembled an all star cast for what amounts to a lengthy, highly ambitious film, taking a fairly simple story, and using it to signpost the #MeToo movement with its tale of women attempting to pull off a crime traditionally (and, in this film, unsuccessfully) by men, as well as encompassing a host of social issues. Unfortunately, possibly owing to over ambition, it all fails to really brew together in one big pot.It's fairly obvious pretty early on that Neeson's way too big a star (with way too big a fee!) to kill off so early without coming back, as well as being too integral to the plot, and so it's no real surprise when he does, only in the capacity that it happens. Sadly, he's just one of the many characters who the film gets an infinite amount of time to explore, but just fails completely to get under the skin of, totally unfleshed out and leaving you unable to really connect with them as people. It's a fault in the writing, and in such capable performers, that this comes to be.McQueen goes for a dark, gloomy, urban Michael Mann style throughout, in a film almost drained of humour and light, which further compounds the film's ability to light up any of these people. It's a project with enormous potential, and he has perfect ability to explore, but fails to do so due to an exasperated scope and failure to control his structuring of the story. A shame. **",Widows
23,ElMaruecan82,"A decent popcorn thriller but a ""Heat"", it sure ain't!",6,1 December 2018,"Seriously, why is it that today every film involving strong female protagonists must portray men like Hadleyville people from ""High Noon"": treacherous, corrupted, psychopathic and when good, simple-minded or physically disabled. ""Widows"" reminded me of that ""Afternoon Yak"" moment in ""The Simpsons"". The TV host opens the show with a simple : ""men"" eliciting an immediate booing from a 100% female audience, prompting Homer to press the 'skip' button.I seriously expected a film from ""12 Years a Slave"" director Steve McQueen and starring Viola Davis, Liam Neeson and recently Oscar-nominated Daniel Kaluuya to aim higher than that. While it doesn't trivialize men-bashing too blatantly, the way it sets up an interesting premise and then shortcuts it through a contradictory narrative is rather counterproductive.The story is set in Chicago where three women mourn the loss of their husbands, who ended like melted meat in morgue bags after a botched heist. Of course, when a film mentions that corpses were unidentifiable and one of them is at the top-billing, you either expect a load of flashbacks or some middle-plot twist. So I wasn't surprised when it started raining a few evidence that one didn't deserve a eulogy. But all of them? Seriously, what were the odds?Let's move on with the plot. Veronica Rawlings lost Harry in an accident and from what the flashbacks convey, they loved each other and meant it on bed. Halfway through the film, their relationship is given an extra layer of depth through a sad event, but it doesn't stain the image of Harry, played by a hunky Liam Neeson. The trick is that Harry burnt along with millions of dollars stolen from Jamal Manning (Brian Tyree Henry) capmpaigning for alderman of a South Side precinct.Jamal is angry, and threatens Veronica, asking her to get the money back. The problem is that Jamal was previously introduced as the challenger against Jack Mulligan, the heir of a dynasty that dominated politics for three generations. Colin Farrell chews the scenery as the sleek and overambitious politician and from his father's racist slurs, we'd be more than glad to see him being dethroned by Jamal (by the way, Robert Duvall steals the show as Mulligan Sr.).So this gets tricky whenJamal seems to be an even worse character, the way he strangles an adorable poodle or uses his psychopathic brother played by Daniel Kaluuya to do the dirty job makes any attempt to figure out which politician is the lesser of the two evils a riddle for ages. But there comes a point when we realize that the outcome of the campaign is totally irrelevant to the plot... which made me question the relevancy of the earlier scenes.Indeed, why spend so much time building up the antagonism between the two camps or trying to turn Jack Mulligan into some tortured soul when the real focus is the three widows. I haven't mentioned the two other important characters yet but this is exactly what the film does: it overlooks them first and then develops them but not in a way that draws us into caring for them... not more than the usual empathy-requirements of an average film.I'm not even sure it did it enough with Davis' character. But at least Veronica had a motive, Amanda (Michelle Rodriguez) and Alice (Elizabeth Debicki) only have circumstances. It's different. Amanda discovers her husband never paid the bills and drove her shop into bankruptcy, she needs money if she wants to keep her children from her mother-in-law's claws. As for Alice who strikes for both her Eastern-European accent and her statuesque height, she was apparently mistreated and is advised to become an escort girl by her own mother (Jacki Weaver, 1ft 2'' shorter than her 'daughter')So we have two women who need to earn money and self-respect. Fair enough. But it's not like Veronica knows that... so the only way she tries to convince them to jeopardize their lives and pull a heist is to tell them they're in danger. All their loyalty depends upon a lie. Of course, the script injected the 'underdog' aspect so we can have unexperienced women overcoming their insecurities, use their weaknesses as strengths and become as badass and independent as men (not that Davis needed any change of character).That could have been good actually. A political thriller would have been good too. Or Davis alone against the gangsters. But the film went in too many directions at the same time. The political set-up turns out to be a completely waste of time because none of the major players of the first act plays a tangible role at the end, the progresses made by the three women are boosted by the addition of Cynthia Erivo who's capable of anything, and even the happy end (anyone could have seen coming) doesn't have that emotional electricity in it.What happened is that the film focused on the three women in a way that made their arcs rather predictable. Amanda gets her business back, Alice, after being treated like meat or trash before, sets up her own business (good luck, we're in 2018). As for Davis, the film tries to make her the subject of a character study while she's only played the usual straight leader of a heist. ""Widows"" depends on an empathy we're ready to give but it throws so many plot lines and ramifications that it ends with disappointing loose ends.And I wouldn't give much weight to all that Oscar conversation, it can happen but I doubt it. Debicki towers over everyone (literally) but her arc is nothing we've not seen before, only Keluuya is terrific and plays his character in the kind of deliberately hammy way such a role requires. But the film took itself too seriously for its own good as if it tried to be an ""Ocean's 8"" for the Oscars.At the end, it's a decent popcorn thriller... with the obligatory ""men-boo"" undertones.",Widows
24,paul2001sw-1,A well-crafted homage,7,2 November 2021,"There's a whole genre of stylised films in which characters sit around talking smart and macho to one another: think about the ouvres of David Mamet or Quentin Tarantino, or, less sucessfully, Ridley Scott's rightly derided 'The Counsellor'. It was the latter film that most obviosuly came to my mind when watching Steve McQueen's 'Widows': McQueen is a very clever film-maker, but there are some resemblences nonetheless, most notably in his movie's string of semi-connected scenes of philophising crooks, though his plot is more coherent and there are some credible (though cliched) action scenes in the mix as well. If every film was like this, it would soon grow tiresome; McQueen does it well, but there's nothing here quite as disturbing as peak Mamet or as fresh as young Tarantino. Rather, it's feels like a well-crafted homage to a slightly weary Hollwood trope.",Widows
25,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"Scattershot, for sure, but still thematically rich and entertaining.",6,11 November 2018,"'Widows (2018)' is scattershot, for sure, and a number of its elements take a considerable amount of time to conflate, if they ever really do. It's certainly much more than the sum of its parts, though, and it's never really confined to one particular genre. Having said that, the piece is very much a 'thriller' and, as well as only being properly thrilling on occasion, it often brings with it the less successful, somewhat 'sillier' elements that you might expect from such a film - especially one based upon an ITV series from the 1980s - without having the 'knowing' vibe, or humour, that could mitigate such factors, making them all the more jarring. Most of the characters remain quite distanced from us, too, despite assured direction and a solid script. Still, it's ultimately an entertaining, thematically rich piece that moves slowly but surely in a steady, culturally-significant direction. 6/10",Widows
26,dromasca,unvonventional heist movie,7,1 January 2019,"It's a good time for films about women, with strong feminist and me2 messages. Some of these films are made by women, most of them allow wonderful opportunities for actresses to play consistent roles, in a quantity and with a quality like never in the history of Hollywood. Some genres are blessed with feminist variants of usually macho themes, and one good example this year is the heist movies genre. 2018 brought to screens two blockbusters of the genre: Gary Ross's 'Ocean's Eight' and 'Widows' directed by Steve McQueen. The genre may be the same, but the styles and the approaches are completely different. In almost any respect 'Widows' is what 'Ocean's Eight' is not.Both films are about a group of women engaging in what can be considered on screen and in real life as a man-only endeavor - planning and executing a sophisticated robbery. The heroines in 'Widows' are not, however, criminals that happen to be women, but rather a bunch of widows whose husbands were in the robberies business and got killed during a last unfortunate coup. Instead of being left to their sorrows the widows will have to execute the next well planned job of the late husbands in order to pay their debts to a gangster turned politician. The background of the action is the city of Chicago, described as a hell of crime and corruption at all levels, up to the politicians involved in the next round of local elections. One way to describe the story in the film is to say it's the story of ordinary women becoming sophisticated gangsters, taking over the profession and learning the skills of robbery mastered by their husbands.This story could have been told in many ways and the principal reason I was not that enthusiastic about the film is that film director Steve McQueen did not seem to decide what kind of film he wanted to make. It's certainly not a light comedy or a heist movie made mainly for the fun of following the ingenuous planning and execution, although it flirts with both genres at various moments. The action elements are not missing but they are not terribly spectacular or very inventive. The focus seems to have been more on the psychology of the characters faced not only with the truth about the way their characters made for a good living, but also obliged to replace them in crime. Fine acting by Viola Davis , Michelle Rodriguez, and Elizabeth Debicki support this part which is the best in the film. It is however the crime intrigue that is surprisingly weak, taking into account that it's based on a script written by Gillian Flynn which was inspired by a novel by Lynda La Plante. I would have expected less abysmal holes and more credibility from a script written by such talents in the world of the American crime story novels. Robert Duvall, Liam Neeson and Colin Farrell contribute with their talents in supporting roles. For once the female characters take precedence, but this is not sufficient for avoiding of 'Widows' to become a movie that misses to fulfill its potential.",Widows
27,ThomasDrufke,Another Win for McQueen,8,19 November 2018,"I'm typically partial to films set in Chicago, but Widows doesn't really need any sort of ""exception"". Steve McQueen's films are admittedly typically very bleak and methodically paced, so they aren't always for everyone, but you have to know what you're getting into. Hunger, Shame, and 12 Years of Slave are all fantastic films in their own right, but they deal with heavy subject matter in a non-mainstream type of way. Widows is clearly the most marketable and mainstream, but it still has McQueen's style and touch. With that said, it takes awhile for Widows to really get going, often opting more for dramatic dialogue than dramatic action. And realistically, the only action scene you get is within the last 20 minutes. If you're okay with that, than there's no reason to not walk out of Widows impressed, even if you're are a bit underwhelmed. Packed with solid lead performances (including an Oscar worthy turn from Viola Davis and potentially Elizabeth Debicki as well), a few surprises, and one helluva gritty story, Widows is a ride worth taking. If it weren't for one small third act choice without closure, this one could have been a best picture contender for me.8.5/10",Widows
28,Cineanalyst,Muddy Ocean's,4,7 March 2019,"""Widows"" is so poorly put together that it manages to feel both languid and rushed and both overly stuffed and ultimately wanting. It's amazing how much talent in front of and behind the camera is undermined here: director-writer Steve McQueen following up on his Best-Picture-winning ""12 Years a Slave"" (2013) and an all-star cast headed by Viola Davis, including Robert Duvall, Colin Farrell, Daniel Kaluuya, Liam Neeson, Michelle Rodriguez and Jacki Weaver. Blink and you might also miss appearances by fairly well-known TV-and-movie actors like Jon Bernthal. It's a tremendous waste of acting, especially because Davis and Elizabeth Debicki's widows are the only two characters that are developed enough to elicit any sympathy or interest.This is based on a TV show, and that's surely why this adaptation feels as though it condensed too much narrative. The Chicago alderman election is probably the most egregious example here; that entire storyline could've been cut. As it is, it's mostly irrelevant and frequently derails the thrust of the picture's central heist. Concurrently, it seems as though McQueen and company were trying to make this genre piece into something that is supposedly socially relevant. Why else spend time on a conversation of a politician badgering his female companion whether she's ever slept with a black man? Moreover, McQueen maintains the camera at an obscure angle of the car they're in for the length of the uncomfortable chat--an angle that's just clear enough for one to notice that the chauffeur is black. Why else have that politician's even-more-blatantly racist father in the movie at all? Why have one unarmed black character killed at the hands of a police officer during a traffic stop? As far as advancing the plot goes, he could've died just about any other way. Why make a fuss about the main marriage having been interracial when it's otherwise most conspicuous for how inconspicuous that fact is? How many shots do you really need of Davis and Neeson touching each other in their bedroom? Not that many.All of these irrelevant detours and excessive stylization (e.g. I like a good through-the-mirror shot, but the ones here just linger for far too long) detracts from what should be the focus of the picture: the heist and the traditional gender reversal of the mistreated widows leading the action.

34,nairtejas,MAMI Review: Widows (7 Stars),7,1 November 2018,"At first glance, Steve McQueen's Widows looks like it has taken the gimmicky responsibility of highlighting the topic of women empowerment in face of recent movements around the world while taking an advantage. But then you realize that it is not, which is perhaps the best thing about this heist drama which is only succeeded by Robert Duvall's mouth-watering performance as this retired politician trying to put some brains into his son currently running for the elections. A story in parallel to this brain-feeding is about four women - all widows; some with kids - who try to get rid of the debt their dead husbands left behind through the only way they think they can get rid of it. Viola Davis plays the leader and mastermind of this small group as they set out to do what others - mostly men - think they can't. And there are a few dialogues that highlight this. Which is why Widows initially looked like that to me. But then the story picks up - unfortunately with its own share of unpredictable yet cliched twists unnatural to McQueen the Oscar winner but natural to McQueen the crowd-puller - and gives you some bang bang to look at and enjoy. Widows plods for some time before it pulls up its socks and serves entertainment, red and hot, and with four highly talented actors in the forefront. Hans Zimmer makes a subtle impact with his score as these widows make Widows a palpable thriller that stops making an impact five minutes after you move out of the hall. Definitely not an Oscar contender but a perfect evening thriller to be caught with friends and family. Widows looks highbrow but it is not.

35,The-Sarkologist,One Dirty Election Campaign,7,26 November 2018,"Once again, like other movies, I have no idea why it is that I end up going to heist movies. In many cases they tend to be quite formulaic, and also tend to drag out quite a bit, and the ending is generally rather predictable. However, this particular one has some rather interesting twists to it, and considering that Steve McQueen is the director you can generally assume that it isn't going to be anywhere near as formulaic as you would expect.Sure, it is a heist movie, but it seems to be being played out around an election campaign, and an incredibly dirty one at that. Sure, election campaigns can be rather dirty, but McQueen actually takes us behind the scenes to see the full view of thuggery and criminality that is going on. For instance, people stealing the opponent's campaign funds, and thugs for hire running around beating people up for the opposition.The story goes that there was a heist, but it goes horribly wrong resulting in the death of all involved when the van explodes. One would expect that this is just typical Hollywood overglorification of violence, and pretty explosions, until you realise that Steve McQueen is involved, and he really is a director in a class of his own. Anyway, these guys leave behind greiving widows, and flags are raised when we discover that one of the candidates is actually at one of the funerals. However, one of the widows discovers what is basically a 'burn book', namely a book that contains details of all the previous heists, and one that hasn't been performed. Well, she decides to get the other widows together and pull off this heist. However, they need to decipher the book first.So, this is what I would consider to be typical of Steve McQueen, if you consider any of his movies to actually be all that typical. Okay, it is rather long and drawn out, but then again it is a heist movie. Sure, it ends in a way that you would expect such a movie to end, except that there are a number of twists involved. The characterisation is also pretty good, particularly the really dirty nature of the election that is playing out.I did like the film, and it is definitely worth watching, but don't expect your typical Hollywood extravaganza that you seem to encounter pretty much all of the time.",Widows
36,tomgillespie2002,Effortlessly deconstructs the heist movie to jaw-dropping effect,8,4 February 2019,"When 12 Years a Slave took home the Best Picture Academy Award back in 2013, many of us expected director Steve McQueen to go even bigger and more ambitious with his next project. After all, his previous films Hunger and Shame were hardly lacking in scope and weight. It's taken five years to finally arrive, but McQueen's new film Widows, adapted from the 1983 ITV drama series of the same name, takes his work into a whole new territory: the genre movie. Yes, Widows seemingly follows the traditions of the great heist movies of old, with Michael Mann's Thief and Heat coming immediately to mind, taking a crack team and handing them a near-impossible task which they must plan with expert precision if they ever hope to pull it off. It would seem that, on paper at least, McQueen has taken it down a notch, but by taking on such a familiar story, the writer/director has given himself an even greater task.Widows opens with the immediate aftermath of a heist gone awry. We watch from inside a speeding van as the wounded gang make their getaway, with their gun-toting victims and the police giving chase. The twist is that they all perish in a warehouse explosion, with the stolen $2 million going up in flames with them. The gang's widows are the ones left feeling the aftershocks: not only are they left grieving for their husbands, but the guy they stole from - alderman campaigner and community leader Jamal Manning (Brian Tyree Henry) - wants his money back. Veronica (Viola Davis) takes the reigns when she finds her husband's notebook, which contains a detailed plan for a heist worth $5 million. Two of the other widows - Alice (Elizabeth Debicki) and Linda (Michelle Rodrgiguez) - have their own financial problems, so they agree to take on the job when Veronica comes a-knocking. They really have no choice. It's either find the money, or Jamal's psychopathic brother Jatemme (a frightening Daniel Kaluuya) will kill them and take everything they own anyway.McQueen's task here is to deconstruct a slice of popcorn cinema and add the kind of punch and social commentary that made his previous work so great. He does so effortlessly, carefully developing each of the leads and making their story believable, later drafting in a fourth member in the form of Belle (Cynthia Erivo), a single mother working multiple jobs to pay the rent. McQueen and co-writer Gillian Flynn (Gone Girl) keep the action fast-paced and brutal, so the 130-minute running time breezes by. If there's a complaint to be had, it's that the film is too short and often feels crammed with too many characters and side-stories. Thrown into the mix is Jamal's campaign opposition Jack Mulligan (Colin Farrell), who has had past dealings with Veronica's husband Harry (Liam Neeson) but has come to the realisation that the political manoeuvring of his elderly father (Robert Duvall) is no longer feasible. Like the series it was based on, Widows may have worked better unravelling over the course of a few episodes. But this may have prevented McQueen from reminding us why he is one of the most important directors working today, as he takes the time to deliver a jaw-dropping shot from the side of a car that shows how quickly a city landscape can shift from dire poverty to luxurious wealth, and a run-in with some trigger-happy police that will remain with you long after the credits have rolled.",Widows
37,Thanos_Alfie,Very good movie...,7,27 April 2021,"""Widows"" is a Crime - Drama movie in which we watch four women team up to gain some money due to a debt left to them after the death of their husbands. They have to set their own terms and see what they can do about it before it's too late.I liked this movie because it had a nice, interesting plot consisted of many great scenes, some plot twists that I did not expect and made it even more interesting. The direction which was made by Steve McQueen, it was simply amazing and I believe that he did an excellent job on it. The interpretations of both Viola Davis who played as Veronica and Elizabeth Debicki who played as Alice were very good. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Michelle Rodriguez's who played as Linda, Colin Farrell's who played as Jack Mulligan and Cynthia Erivo's who played as Belle. Finally, I have to say that ""Widows"" is a nice crime movie that combines very well action with drama, and I highly recommend everyone to watch it.",Widows
38,cruise01,Could have been better with the pacing and its tedious direction.,6,3 December 2018,"Widows (3 out of 5 stars).Widows is a heist film filled with twists and turns, great cast ensemble, and too long of a dull direction. Steve McQueen direction tries to be a little raw with its tension of racist police, corrupt politicians, abusive husbands, and mob bosses. The plot is layered with a thick story that tries to cover it all. His direction can be a little boring at times were nothing happens for a long stretch of a running time.The plot follows Harry (Liam Neeson) a thief and his group of men Florek and Jimmy robbing from a crime boss. When the robbery falls apart and nothing works out. Leaving their wives behind as widows, Veronica (Viola Davis), Linda (Michelle Rodriguez), and Alice (Elizabeth Debicki) are struggling to live on their own. And are being taunted by Jatemme (Daniel Kaluuya) to recover the money their husbands stole. Meanwhile, a rising politican Jack (Colin Farrell) is trying to win the election with his competitor Jamal (Brian Tyree Henry) getting mixed up with the affair after the robbery sets everything in motion. I can not say much more about the story without giving away spoilers. There are a few twists and turns. It is surprisingly better than I expected with the story.Viola Davis was great. Same with the rest of the cast ensemble who all did great. Michelle Rodriguez and Elizabeth Debicki both playing widows and struggling to live on their own. Colin Farrell was good as a politician that is always being looked down on by his father played by Robert Duvall. Daniel Kaluuya plays a good psychopath that is harassing three leading ladies about the stolen money.Sadly, the film does struggle with its long running time which felt too long than it should have been. It does get slow and boring with the pacing. Long stretches of nothing. Once the three leading ladies are planning on the heist job things starts picking up which is almost after an hour of its long running time. Veronica, Linda, and Alice are plotting the heist by finding the location, vehicle, weapons, and these inexperienced ladies are learning to get the job done.The second thing I was disappointed was the music score is underwhelming. Especially, by Hans Zimmer. His score was forgettable.Overall, Widows is a fair heist movie. Great cast. Good plot with its twists and turns. The direction is dull and slow moving and a tedious music score.",Widows
39,Floated2,Highly overlooked heist thriller,8,19 August 2019,"Widows wasn't exactly a big success at the box office despite its great reviews. Critics seemed to enjoy this film as it has been highly praised yet the audience responses are slightly less. It's current IMDB rating of 6.9 is slightly underrated as this film was better than expected.Much complaint is that the film is slow or drags on to get to the heist but within these scenes of build up, there are enough characters and different subplots along to way to be entertained. This has a run time of over 2 hours but the pacing works and it goes by quickly.The performances are great and it works as an ensemble. Of the cast Daniel Kaluuya steals his scenes. The camera work is well done and there are several key and not completely surprising twists that happen. Widows is more than a heist film, its more so of a character study drama with selective action sequences. Surprised at how the top reviews on here are mostly negatives. Widows is a great film and highly overlooked. Instant recommendation.",Widows
40,eddie_baggins,A heist film with a difference,8,26 November 2018,"A heist film this is not, going into Widows and expecting it to be will likely leave you highly disappointed but thankfully just because Steve McQueen's film isn't what some may've expected it to be doesn't mean it's not one of the year's most unique, energetic and entertaining high-profile releases.Seemingly an odd match for a director whose made his mark with purely dramatic offerings, Hunger, Shame and 12 Years a Slave, this adaptation of the old-school UK TV show of the same name, that has seen McQueen team-up with Gone Girl author Gillian Flynn appears on paper to be a strange career choice for the Oscar nominated filmmaker but using the seemingly simple set-up of a bunch of widowers taking up their deceased criminal partners mantle and pulling off a daring heist, Flynn and McQueen create an incendiary look at the city of Chicago as Widows shines a light on the underbelly of the city's current climate.It becomes a fairly loaded plotline as we follow Viola Davis's determined Veronica as she, with the help of Elizabeth Debicki's Alice and Michelle Rodriguez's Linda look to clear their husband's debts after they botched a heist involving government officials and a large sum of money but that's not all the films concerned with as McQueen brings in a collection of side plots and twist and turns that includes Collin Farrell and Brian Tyree Henry warring election candidates and Daniel Kayuuya's vicious gangster Jatemme Manning going about his business of recovering money that was stolen from him and his gangster/politican brother.In many ways there's almost too much going on in Widows two hour runtime, as the film deals with its hefty collection of characters and narrative arcs and in doing so the film in some ways becomes a little bit of a cold experience emotionally as we don't get to know some of McQueen and Flynn's characters like we would like to, but it's a slight criticism of a film that's so slickly made and filled with notable turns.As we've come to expect from McQueen, who graduated from artist to filmmaker in the late 2000's (arguably thesame thing), Widows is a visually stunning and well-made film that's backed up by a non-intrusive but atmospheric Hans Zimmer score that combines well with the filmmaker's vision, that includes a standout opening car chase, wince-inducing scenes in a basketball stadium and bowling alley and a memorising car conversation that takes us on a tour of Chicago's social divide between the rich and the poor.When combined with many of the solid acting turns, these scenes help give Widows a vibrancy and style that make it such a standout event.Lead by the always intense Davis, Widows is also a nice showcase for the growth of fellow actresses Debicki, Rodriquez and up and comer Cynthia Erivo who all deliver fabulous turns and even if Daniel Kayuuya (in a tight race with the scene-stealing dog from Game Night fame) steals the film with his few intense scenes, it's fantastic to see a female-centric cast work so well together and considering just how bad Ocean's 8 was in the female empowerment/heist sub-genre early this year, Widows is even more of a cinematic delight.Final Say -A loaded and politically motivated crime drama, Widows has a lot to say in a short time and while it may not exactly strike it rich emotionally, this is another prime example of why McQueen is one of the best director's working today, offering a thrilling and surprising new addition to his brilliant C.V.4 Obama posters out of 5",Widows
41,pmtelefon,Self-important and tedious.,4,22 September 2019,"Someone should have explained to writer/director Steve McQueen that if you walk out onto a bowling lane that you will slip on the oil and fall on your butt. I know that point may be a nitpick but that's when I began to lose interest in ""Widows"". I was trying to hang in there with this movie but that that's the point that I realized that I was fooling myself. That this movie is pretty bad. The script is just not that good. You can't squeeze blood from a stone. At the end of the day ""Widows"" does nothing except have its four appealing female leads run around for two hours with sour pusses on their faces. After all the twists and turns are over, ""Widows"" is a semi-annoying waste of time.",Widows
42,matthewssilverhammer,one of the greatest and most unique films of 2018,10,25 November 2018,"Widows is what it looks like when an artist makes a genre picture. Impeccable McQueen (12 Years a Slave) takes the tried-and-true staples of the heist drama (plot twists, grey ""heroes"" and ""villains"", mismatched team members, a difficult job, emotional and financial motivations) and spins them masterfully. In lesser hands, the ins-and-outs of a story this complex could get out of hand, but McQueen is such a precise and clear filmmaker that Widows sidesteps unwieldiness with cool, beautiful brains.
You may remember Ocean's 8, another 2018 female-fronted heist thriller. But where that movie clumsily shoved new women characters into a pre-existing male franchise in order to make gauche comments on feminism, Widows truly displays the critical ownership and powerful autonomy of all women. ""We have a lot of work to do, and crying is not on the list,"" quips Davis's character, who deftly leads an onslaught of incredible performances, male and female alike, each taking a familiar genre trope (dumb blonde, corrupt politicians, grieving widows) and bending it to their will. We're sure to see many of these names on awards season ballots, though picking which are the best is an act of futility.
After making films about false imprisonment, sexual addiction, and American slavery, this would seem to be McQueen's least ""important film"", and maybe it is. However, just because it's a fun movie doesn't mean it's shallow. A Trump-era film with bipartisan complexity, it never lets individual, hot-button issues overshadow the larger truth of political corruption on both sides of the aisle. With thoughtful patience and needed urgency, Widows is one of the greatest and most unique films of 2018.",Widows

I agree.Definitely NOT suited for men or boys who expect a macho action packed heist movie. Why not? Because director Steve McQueen changed everything one would normally expect in a heist movie.

45,paul-allaer,Movie would've benefited from sharper focus,6,10 December 2018,"""Widows"" (2018 release; 129 min.) opens with a bang: we are in the midst of a robbery getaway going wrong, as the 4 thieves try to survive. Alas, they fall to a trap and don't survive. In a parallel cut, we see these 4 guys with their wives as they begin their day. We then shift focus to Jack Mulligan, who is running for Alderman in Chicago and fighting off a campaign by erstwhile (or still) crime boss Jamal Manning. After that we finally shift focus to the 4 surviving widows, who now face an uncertain future. Then Veronica is contacted by Manning with an explosive allegation: her now-dead husband stole #2 million from Mulligan, and he wants Veronica to pay him back... At this point we are 15 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: any movie that is directed by Oscar-winning Steve McQueen, and co-written by McQueen and Gillian ""Gone Girl"" Flynn, and starring an all-star cast, will catch my attention. However, only 15 min. into the movie, it become clear that this isn't just a ""revenge"" heist movie (as the movie's trailer would have you believe). No, there are also strong political intrigues and even racial justice issues. As a result, the movie is just sprawling in the first half. And when the Big Plot Twist arrives 75 min. into the movie, it is as unlikely (if not ridiculous) as it is unnecessary. Thankfully the last half hour make up for some of this, as we then FINALLY get to the ""revenge heist"" that we had been promised in the trailer. Speaking of the movie's all-star cast, where to begin? Viola Davis is as tough as she is authoritative, Liam Neeson is her husband (and thief) Harry. Colin Farrell is Jack Mulligan, and Robert Duvall plays his father (and crooked politician). Jacki Weaver has a small role (less than 5 min. of screen time). But the person who really caught my attention is up-and-coming actress Elizabeth Debicki, who plays one of the 4 surviving widows. Surely we will see a lot more of her in the years to come. It's a bit of a shame then that, with all of this amazing talent, the movie feels like it would've benefited from sharper focus. Now it seems like a collection of many different things, but the collection doesn't quite add up.""Widows"" premiered at this year's Toronto International Film Festival to good acclaim, yet the film has underwhelmed at the box office since it opened wide just before Thanksgiving. The Sunday early evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended so-so (about 15-20 people).

46,billcr12,good cast,5,23 January 2019,The cast is great from Viola Davis to Liam Neeson but the story has too many plot holes.

47,jadavix,A festival of ridiculousness,3,8 February 2019,"""Widows"" is one of the dumbest movies I have ever seen.It is a strange attempt to marry a silly action-thriller plot with some ""The Wire""-like social commentary. The typically superb direction from Steve McQueen doesn't so much as elevate the ridiculous plot as it does belie it. It becomes a game of spotting the silliness.The plot, as you probably already know, is about four women widowed when their thieving husbands are killed by police during a heist gone wrong. The gang stole from a local African American crime boss, and now that boss goes to visit the widow of the gang leader, demanding his two million dollars back.So far so good? Not so fast. Why doesn't the widow just go to the cops? She wasn't involved in her husband's criminal enterprise, so she has no reason not to just report this. And how does the crime boss expect her to come up with this money, anyway?The plot thickens, or rather, congeals.At the open-air funeral for the gang leader (played by Liam Neeson), the widow is approached by a local politician (Colin Farrell), who is on the campaign trail, and who comforts the widow of this renowned thief, making it plain that he knew and respected him.Um. Does it seem slightly odd to anyone else that a rising politician wouldn't even try to hide the fact that he was palsy-palsy with a famous criminal?""Widows"" gets even more ridiculous when it is revealed that the crime lord who threatened the guy's widow is also running for office. I was under no illusions that politicians are squeaky clean, but does it seem a bit beyond the pale to you that a guy running for public office is also a crime lord, with no qualms about approaching his constituents with death threats if they don't pay him back his blood money? Anybody wanting to dig up dirt on these guys certainly have their work cut out for them. Hell, they wouldn't even need to do any digging - these guys air their dirty laundry right out in the open, in front of everyone!Oh, and the aspiring politician-slash-brutal crime lord also attended the master thief's funeral.Of course, the central plot is also ridiculous, that widows of these thieves would discover their plans for a heist, and carry it out themselves, going from ignorant housewives to criminal geniuses in a matter of weeks, and that they would all be on board with the crime. But this ridiculous plot is dwarfed by the ridiculousness of the set-up, and besides, it's such a typical Hollywood high-concept that you don't bat an eyelid at it.I just can't believe that the filmmakers expect us to swallow the idea of politicians in the Instagram age attending funerals of notorious criminals - and actually being notorious criminals themselves, before entering politics.",Widows

This is an all female heist movie-think a dark Ocean's Eight-that has some nice twists. It is directed by Steve McQueen-who also directed 12 Years a Slave-and is based on a 1983 British tv series. Most of the male cast have smaller parts, since they are killed in a bungled heist at the beginning of the movie-and I am not giving away secrets here, their demises are in the trailers and the title of the movie. Besides the men being killed in a shoot out with the police, the money is also destroyed in an explosion during the shoot out. Liam plays the leader of the gang and he is married to Viola. Michelle & Elizabeth are other widows that are now in dire need of money. It seems that their husbands were keeping secrets from them about their finances. Colin plays a politician running for office in the district. Viola discovers that the money Liam was trying to get away with belonged to a dirty money launderer that wants it back-I mentioned that the money was destroyed, remember? Viola finds a diary left by Liam that describes his next big heist-$5 million-and gets the other widows together to do the job that will hopefully get them all out of money problems. My only complaint is that it is a little slow in parts.

Looking around I see that a lot of the film was filmed in Chicago but they really picked good locations to stage the various scenes to capture the flavor of the city. Best of all is McQueen's style of long uninterrupted takes dwell on the Chicagoan setting and ratchet up the tension. The long takes also help making a lot of the standard heist/political scenes feel quite different and fresh. There is a great scene of using a tracking shot from outside a car for the entire scene. that really stood out to me.

Rather than playing the background characters or women who are meek little heroines in need of rescue, they've taken on lead roles that have gone to men in the past. Many times this has worked against women with them remaking movies that starred men in the same roles (GHOSTBUSTERS, OCEAN'S EIGHT). But on occasion some great movies have been made offering women lead roles more worthy of them, original films that deserve attention. WIDOWS is one of those movies.The film literally opens with a bang as a heist gone wrong takes place. The men involved are wounded and on the run when the police catch up with them, not just shooting them but blowing up the van they were driving. The men and the money from the heist at the same time are gone in a flash.All of this is taking place during a high stakes election in Chicago. The opposing forces are Jack Mulligan (Colin Farrell), the latest in a long line of Chicago style politicians whose father Tom (Robert Duvall) has done something to make his sure thing not so certain. His opponent is Jamal Manning (Brian Tyree Henry), a local crime boss turned politician who sees a more lucrative career milking contracts as a politician.In the midst of this tight election the two opposing forces are doing everything they can to win, be that legal or not. When it turns out the money that was lost were the same funds backing candidate Manning he holds the widows of the men who were stealing the money responsible. He now tells Veronica (Viola Davis), the widow of the ring leader Harry (Liam Neeson), that he holds her responsible and gives her one month to come up with the money.But Veronica wasn't aware of the dealings of Harry. All she has is a key to a safe deposit box. What she finds in the box is meticulous details that Harry kept in a notebook as well as the plans for his next heist. Turning to the other widows, each in dire needs with the deaths of their husbands, she makes them an offer. Join her to carry out the last job, pay off the debt to Jamal who otherwise will kill them all and still have enough left over to live a decent life.As Viola works on each of the wives to join (Michelle Rodriquez, Elizabeth Debicki and Carrie Coon) she assigns those who join her different jobs to prepare for the job. Picking up weapons, finding out where the location the floor plans Harry left behind are to and finding a driver for the job.As all of this is taking place two other stories are running concurrently. One is the political maneuverings going on between the candidates. The second involves Jamal's son Jatemme (Daniel Kaluuya), still employing the thuggish street gang methods his father once employed to find out what Veronica is up to. Leaving behind wounded and dead men in his wake, he plans on taking things into his own hands.A twist presents itself about an hour in and then all of these threads tie together to form the final 30 minutes of the film. They are weaved together intricately and splendidly to tell a story that's more than one would expect from a simple heist film. And while one twists is presented more are compiled one on top of the other before the credits role.And while we're witnessing these women commit a crime we want to see them get away with it, to redeem themselves from the terrible predicament they've been put into. We cheer them on as they become resourceful and learn to work with one another in spite of their differences in lifestyle and predicament. We want them to succeed and for the bad guys to get what's coming to them. They are a formidable force to be reckoned with and one that no one expects to come out on top. We cheer them on because they're the underdog. These are strong female characters and a nice change to what we've seen women play in the past.

The way in which things unfolds, including setbacks makes this a realistic scenario.This is a gritty film, life is cheap, members of Jamal's gang who have made mistakes are killed, hold-ups don't go to plan, more deaths ensue. People are tortured and murdered to get information The women who seem powerless after their partners deaths, Linda loses her shop, Alice has to work as an escort. develop new skills. Ruthlessness is required, blackmail is used to get safe codes. Over all of it though hangs the outcome of the election which will give the winner access to millions of dollars a year in bribes and kickbacks. Duvall is convincing as the old style politician while his son Farrell excels as the one who uses social media to campaign. Viola Davis though gives the standout performance followed closely by Debicki and Rodriguez.Steve McQueen has delivered not just a crime drama but also an effective dissection of Chicago's local politics. 8/10.",Widows
60,alansabljakovic-39044,On point,8,5 December 2018,"Great action/drama movie with some so so expected twists. Cast is incredible, I mean Kaluuya was amazing in his bad guy role, absoultely loved Farrell in this role maybe his best for me, Duvall got really really old but he is class and of course Viola Davis is always on her level with rest of the widows being great. Liam Neeson is in his standarnd role and his voice is amazing as ever. A lot of violence for someone's taste but I really liked it and didn't mind it. Camera movement is great and some shots are beautiful and I really loved the moving car camera. Another Mcqueen's masterpiece and you should watch it on big screen. I'm expecting some Oscar noms.
P.s. Don't watch it with parents because the first scene might be awkward and some other scenes too.",Widows

Inspired by a British series McQueen saw on the BBC in the 80's, this American remake transports the story of a failed robbery & the men who lost their lives committing it to our shores & opens the tale w/side elements of politics & gangsterism to give the film a more deeper set of aesthetics to play with. Enter the women of the tale, who are the wives, girlfriends or significant others to the criminals who initially bought the farm, now being pressured by the pair of crime lord brothers who were robbed to make good on the failed theft. When the lead thief's detailed robbery diary pops up, our main heroine, played by Oscar winner Viola Davis, comes up w/a plan to pull the next score themselves in order to pay their debt & have something for a rainy day. What could have been a typical masculinization of a gang of chicks kicking ass & taking names becomes a dialectic between the realities of crime whether socio-political, racial or in this case gender & the notion of taking your foes for granted. A brilliant cast featuring Michelle Rodriguez, Elizabeth Debicki, & newcomer Cynthia Erivo hit all the right notes in this tense, smart thriller which is damn well near perfect.",Widows
62,truemythmedia,Fantastic,9,10 July 2019,"Steve McQueen (""12 Years a Slave"") has yet to make a bad movie, and Gillian Flynn, the author behind Gone Girl, knows how to spin a twisted yarn, so this film was a pretty safe bet. Add to the top-notch director and writer a dozen A-list actors and you've got yourself a thriller worth remembering. Where this movie really succeeds isn't just in telling a story however, it's in providing a commentary about the political and socioeconomic landscape that shapes our world today.

Steve McQueen's direction is incredible resulting in thrilling and realistic action sequences. The performances from all of the cast are fantastic, especially Viola Davis, Liam Neeson, Daniel Kaluuya, Brian Tyree Henry and Colin Farrell.

65,jadepietro,Rewriting the Wrongs,7,22 November 2018,"GRADE: B-IN BRIEF: A well made thriller that has some moments of suspense but never consistently blends the heist action with the personal drama.JIM'S REVIEW: Steve McQueen's heist thriller, Widows, wants to be more than a typical caper movie. It has much to say about corruption in the government, domestic abuse, women's empowerment, and Chicago's violent crimes in numerous sub-plots but its main event gets lost in the shuffle.After an initial exciting start with an explosive action scene brilliantly intercutting the domestic life of the four soon-to-be-widows, the film settles into another story-line about two dirty politicians fighting for money and power. Their war slowly begin to involve these women as they struggle to survive their husbands' irresponsible and costly legacies.Mr. McQueen is quite skillful in his staging of his action sequences when they do arrive. But getting there is scattershot between the human drama and the caper. Things slow down with too many fond memories in flashbacks that soon become monotonous and overstated. The film's pacing and rhythm seems off. It takes almost half of the movie just to assemble this Ocean's 8 gang to get down to business.But the director sure knows how to assemble his cast of actors who work overtime to pump up the emotional impact. Viola Davis is excellent as the mastermind in need of cash to pay off her husband's debts. Michelle Rodriguez, Cynthia Erivo, and especially Elizabeth Debicki as her partner-in-crime abet her very nicely.
Strong supporting turns are given by Colin Farrell, Robert Duvall, Liam Neeson, Brian Tyree Henry, and a menacing Daniel Kaluuya. However, the talented Carrie Coons is wasted in her underwritten role as is Jackie Weaver who creates a memorable character in her only scene.The main problem with Widows is mostly script-related. Mr. Mc Queen co-wrote this hybrid of crime story / melodrama with Gillian Flynn and overstuff their screenplay with important commentary about our violent world plus the financial plight of the women. It just doesn't gel because very little screen time is spent on the planning stages of the heist. Important details about the set-up are sorely missing or glossed over for any moviegoer's involvement to build which makes the actual theft and suspense secondary. The criminal scheme's possible lack of success seems inevitable, even with all the clever twists and double crosses. Some re-writes were necessary to clear up too many leaps of logic that take us to an ending with some unclear results. The denouncement certainly contains an easy paper trail and enough dead bodies that any rookie police officer could solve, leading to possible future arrests that never occur.Widows fails to impress due to its meandering storytelling. While the film is acted to maximum effect, it would have been better to focus on the more interesting caper aspects and less on the peripheral plotting around it. The movie exhausts rather than thrills. And it is the latter that ultimately is what a thriller needs to do.",Widows
66,rgkarim,Killing Me Softly With It's Plot/Pace,7,17 November 2018,"Another Friday night, another chance to review movies. Tonight we move away from the fantasy and drop into a more realistic film that hopes to be a dive into a more realistic setting for us to enjoy. With a major cast to lead the way, tonight's movie from the trailers seemed to suggest an exciting crime drama, that would hopefully bring some edge to this weekend. Yet what lies in store behind the trailer? That's where yours truly comes in to give you the information on the latest movie to hit the silver screen. Let's get started as Robbie K reviews:Movie: Widows (2018)
Director:
Steve McQueen
Writers:
Gillian Flynn (screenplay by), Steve McQueen(screenplay by)
Stars:
Viola Davis, Michelle Rodriguez, Elizabeth Debicki
LIKES:Acting: Right out of the gate we need to highlight how epic the acting is in this smorgasbord of actors and actresses. Davis is the biggest one highlighted, once more proving herself as a queen of the crime/drama franchise. Her tone, her poise, her deadly look are all perfect for this emotionally intense role of the character facing both internal and external demons that torture her. With Rodriguez, she's a watered-down version of Letty from the Fast And The Furious, aggressive, sullen, and assertive to the point of being monotone. As for Debicki, stunningly beautiful, fashionable of the bunch, and a wonderful moral compass that the group sort of need in their quest for moving on. Other characters play their parts well as the secondary characters, each adding that dab of crime noir magic that leads to the political story at hand.Realism: I can appreciate a good realistic movie when it goes to crafting a story in this genre. Widows forgoes the fantasy and fiction, to instead bring about realistic issues that are hot areas of interest in the political world. Integrating these issues into the girls backstories and further layering the story with other social struggles, will make a setting that those in love with crime dramas soak up. As such, Widows is all about bringing that relevance to the audience, hoping to lure the audience in and help develop the relationships of this character centric story. Be ready for that component to be the driving line of the movie, because it is a strong, strong factor.The Style: primarily in Elizabeth's character, the clothes are certainly stylish with our cast of future crime committers. While not quite matching the style of the Ocean's 8 squad, the widows have their fair share of clothing to dazzle and delight the audience, or at least make you envy the world of high money.The Twists: The story is very character heav as mentioned before, and with it comes the ability to bring some interesting surprises at hand. Widows has a few very good twists that are time superbly and open the gates for more drama to make the soap operas have a run for their money. Not the most mind-blowing mind you, but an applause at the surprises in store for this film.The Dog: A cute little puppy graces much of the film, and its adorable face serves to relieve the darker tones established in this movie. Widows cute little mascot was my favorite character, and while there is little else this animal serves for, I still like to mention the little pet.DISLIKES:Character Skewing: The movie was supposed to be about the girls all being involved in this plan to pay off their debt and hopefully change their lives. Viola Davis character is again the central character, getting such wonderful looks into her life and by far having the most detail in her life. Sadly, that's where things start to go awry for me. The rest of the characters stories are surprisingly linear, shallow tales that we only get a peek into often in very dry dialogue. Other characters are caught up in political shout outs, not really impressive in that display outside of trying to get a house of cards flow going.The Lack Of Action: If you saw the trailers, you might have been hoping for a little stimulation in this movie as most crime movie have. Well, the link didn't lie, it certainly is not the usual rime story in this film. Widows decides to deviate from the usual plot, plan, and execute said plan for that drama/romance aspect. If you wanted a break, and the focus on such aspects than this is the film for you. Yet, if you saw the trailer like I did and wanted a little more traditional suspense into the film, that is where the movie failed for me. Without those moments of planning and showing the aim of the mission overall, this movie sort of aimlessly bumbled around feeling stuck in an ever-ongoing game of relationship pong.The Pace: The result of this focus on romance/relationships leads to a much slower movie, that drags on and on. Without more exciting moments to break open the convoluted, character thick plot, I had to fight some sleep against the molasses movement, and hope that there were enough twists to keep me guessing. Sadly, Widows didn't have quite enough excitement to knock the excitement into me, though I did manage to stay awake for it.The Rushed Plot: While I said the move rocks on focusing on characters, it does not mean that it was the best story to grace the silver screen. Widows story threw so many hints for a number of the characters, making a point to painstakingly show off each woman's response to the funeral and tease at some potential deep stories. Instead, much of the details are skimped around, leaving only hints and small revelations that don't work quite well. In addition, many of these plot points are kind of randomly dropped in, almost as if they were a second thought that had to be hastily integrated into the film. Most of these really didn't add much to the film, again requiring more details and build up to really mean something.Too Many Things: The movie I think tried to do too much with its direction, trying to figure out which aspect it wanted to highlight over others. Political wise, the movie definitely sails to new horizons to bring with it some valuable food for thought that future generations can discuss. However, in terms of entertainment, romance, and crime I feel the movie couldn't accomplish this. Much of this has to do with too many characters and subplots rolling around the screen and trying to keep each one in check. Corrupt politicians, a heated race for some position, more deals, etc. there are so many micro tales going it is not very easy or entertaining to watch. As such, this confusing storm of plots leads you wanting a little better completion, and more so, better editing to cut through the chaotic string jungle this plot stays on.The VERDICT:Overall, Widows gets props for the realistic, originality it holds in regards to this category. A wonderful crew was cast for this, but I don't think that everyone was used equally and to their full potential. The movie has a lot of plots to choose to follow, but much of their filling is very thin, skimpy on details that needed much more refining to help deliver all it wanted. Throw in that some action and suspense needed to be integrated and you could have had a much better movie overall. As such, the movie is not for most audience members, and I implore the people to wait for this one instead of flocking to the theater.My scores are:Crime/Drama/Romance: 7.0
Movie Overall: 6.0",Widows
67,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of Widows,5,20 November 2018,"These ain't Four Brothers, they're four sisters. They're four women who have to take care of their husband's debt after said husbands die in a botched robbery. They plan a lucrative score to appease a nasty crime boss who wants $2 million dollars from them. That's the rub of 2018's Widows, my latest review. It's part soap opera, part heist piece, and all mob filler.Question: What flick has well known troupers like Jacki Weaver (she's in one and a half scenes), Jon Bernthal (he's in half a scene), Liam Neeson, and Robert Duvall barely registering as full blown personas? Answer: Widows does and despite its readable twist early on, the pic feels solely edited on the chopping block.Anyway, Widows is like an Ocean's Eleven movie minus the fun but with more of the brutality. And if you live in the city of Chicago like I do (Widow's main locale), Widow's cankerous violence (remember Death Wish?) and remorseless nature will surely leave you with a bad taste in your mouth. One scene in particular reminded me of 2014's police shooting of Chicagoan Laquan McDonald. Man I tell you that can't be good.Registering at 129 minutes with too many miscast actors and enough subplots to power a small country, Widows is polarizing and ideological to the nth degree. Its only sequence of real excitement involves ladies in hockey masks with desperation on their minds and cocked firearms in tote. Almost everything else in Widows has to do with false hope and mean-spirited malaise.Steve McQueen helms Widows after a five-year hiatus from 12 Years a Slave. His unsympathetic direction is off-kilter as he gives us weird GoPro shots and lets the camera pan away when people are having middling confrontations (who does he think he is, Taxi Driver Scorsese?). All in all, Widows may rattle the squeamish and make you feel unsafe in a heated theater. Still, it's a miscalculation for almost everyone else involved. My rating: 2 stars.",Widows
68,justin-fencsak,Underrated movie that's not getting a lot of award love..,10,8 December 2018,"When I went to see this movie i read it got good buzz but is falling apart at the box office due to competition from bigger movies like Wreck It Ralph 2, Creed II, and others. It's easy to see why....this movie, like Green Book, which i'm seeing tomorrow, falls into the category of awards bait that is not getting picked up by audiences and the awards press yet critics loved it. Very slow moving at first but gets interesting towards the end. Directed by Steve McQueen, not the famous actor, but the director of 12 Years a Slave, which won best picture nearly 5 years ago, and loosely based on a 1983 ITV (UK) miniseries of the same name, this film gets its name from four widows of four men who were killed in Chicago who go on a heist to find who done it. I like the soundtrack and the way the film was shot and sounded like, so go see it in the theater before it's gone by the time the awards are announced next month.",Widows
69,Easygoer10,Room for improvement,7,3 December 2018,"Ate there any films out today that Viola Davis is not in? Seriously, I like her a lot. She has a prrsence like no other woman; specifically, she uses pauses in her delivery in many films, especially the past 5 years. I am glad for her. To be honest, she should have been cast in more films going back a long time. I am referring to all the TV she did, with small but powerful roles in films. A perfect exampke is Law Abiding Citizen, ehich stars Gerard Butler and Jamie Foxx. She has maybe 5 or 10 minutes of screen time (maximum), cast as the mayor of Philadelphia. It is a small, but memorable role because of her presence. Widows could have been better. It is good, but predictable (to me). I would skip it.",Widows
70,ArtVandelayImporterExporter,Even worse than the average heist flick,1,12 February 2021,"Heist movies are, by and large, a tired genre that haven't had anything fresh to say since, well, the first heist flick.But that apparenlty didn't slow down director S McQueen. He just assembled the usual group of incompetents to plan and attempt the heist, and then plastered on a bunch of characters and story threads that - as far as I can tell - come from 3-4 different movies.There's Liam Neeson in the cast as a criminal mastermind. I boldly suggest he's here only for his marquee value. He makes no difference whatsoever to the finished film.There are the bl@cks who were Neeson's rival gangsters. They want their money back. Meanwhile they're gonna go around threatening and stabbing people.Then there's Colin Farrell, pretending to be a budding American politician and son of former Chicago alderman Robert Duvall. This added nothing to the movie other than swearing. I'm almost certain that was another movie that Mcqueen spliced into this one.Why was Lukas Haas character in this movie? The skinny blonde's mom? The dog? The short-haired woman with the toddler?Then there are the heist masterminds, I wasn't remotely as interested in Viola Davis's character as the movie expects me to be. She was a very unsympathetic protagonist. The skinny blonde was completely empty and unappealing. And that leaves the Hispanic woman as the only character who came across as believable. And yet I still didn't care about her either.By the time the kid we've not seen before in the movie gets pulled over by trigger-happy cops and shot while reaching for his licence and registration, I actually said out loud,''Oh, gimme a break.""There isn't a sincere scene in this entire movie. It's glossy, slickly made and completelye hollow. Much like 12 Years a Slave.I predict a bright future for McQueen, the bl2ck Martin Scorcese. Movie audiences love to gobble up well-made Hollywood hokum.",Widows

73,fntstcplnt,Widows (2018),8,29 July 2019,"Directed by Steve McQueen. Starring Viola Davis, Elizabeth Debicki, Michelle Rodriguez, Colin Farrell, Brian Tyree Henry, Cynthia Erivo, Daniel Kaluuya, Lukas Haas, Garret Dillahunt, Robert Duvall, Kevin J. O'Connor, Liam Neeson, Carrie Coon, Jacki Weaver, Matt Walsh, Jon Bernthal. (R)Cash-strapped and threatened by unsavory and ruthless types, the widows (Davis, Delicki, Rodriguez) of dead professional thieves come together in desperation to steal millions from immoral politician Farrell. More weight and nuance than the typical heist movie, with a tangled web of unscrupulous characters and sub-plots (some better than others, and some left dangling and forgotten by the end) always circling the central storyline. Grim and nail-spiked, as expected from director McQueen, with equal parts gritty-realism and Hollywood-polish mixed together into a viscous tar that coats the entire film. Well-acted by an unusually deep cast (especially Davis and Debicki) with heavy dollops of social commentary and narrative switchbacks, but the heist itself is disappointingly routine and the gaping story holes (that only grow larger upon post-credits reflection) threaten to collapse the entire enterprise. What could have been a great genre-bound epic (such as ""Heat"") ends up being just an uneven-but-occasionally-excellent exercise.76/100",Widows
74,nancyldraper,Shift your expectations at the door,8,26 November 2018,"Shift your expectations at the door - This is not an action adventure heist movie, like Oceans 8, yet it is a very good crime film. This is a slow burn drama from the pen of Lynda La Plante (writer of many great female centric UK works, Prime Suspect with Helen Mirren being, perhaps, the most awarded). This is also not the first incarnation of this story - it has been a TV series in the 80s, another movie in 2002 (Mercedes Ruehl, Rosie Perez, Brooke Sheilds and N'Bushe Wright) and is now reimagined with a likewise stellar cast. This movie has gripping emotional depth, great performances, and a story with twists and turns. I give this film an 8 (great) out of 10. {Crime Drama}",Widows

76,Foutainoflife,Not Gonna Be One Of My Favs But Still Enjoyable,6,5 June 2019,This was a decent film but for me it was lacking something. Maybe it was because there just didn't seem to be a whole lot going on between the women. They weren't bonded and they were cold. I know it was to aid in the drama but the drama was so thick at times. It didn't seem to have the depth I was hoping or expecting to see for drama that was so heavy.

Another BLM vehicle for black actors by another overrated director purely now because hollywood has to obsequiously pander to the BLM movement .The BBC Widows mini-tv movie shown 1983 was a much better effort.
I bet no one noticed but the magnificent baddie Ann Mitchell who was the main star in the 1983 series actually made a cameo appearance as Amanda's Mother in this poor retread of a great original series.Music was good.

79,martimusross,A Mixed Bag of A Movie,5,10 November 2018,"Incoherent in its multiplicity of themes this movies is a mixed bag of elements that worked and others that just overly complicated a simple heist.What was good, Colin Farrell was good as was Elizabeth Debicki giving solid nuanced performances of conflicted characters, I also loved Olivia the dog who just dominated her scenes. Viola Davis and Liam Neeson overworked it and appeared nearly hysterical throughout which was a great shame.The plot was labyrinthine and some plot turns just had no motivational necessity.Overall I enjoyed it but where was the glittering promise we expected from Steve McQueen who seems to have lost his way he needs to decide either a block buster crime drama or an issue led movie a mixture of two genres is destined for failure.",Widows
80,michaeltrivedi,Doesn't Disappoint,8,31 December 2019,"Widows is a very emotional movie but it's not short on action. The beginning few minutes blew me away, and set me up for what would be an epic heist movie with artistic undertones, and yes, emotions. The movie didn't live upto that hype, but it was an interesting ride nonetheless.The movie is about a heist gone wrong, where all the members died. Their wives are left to blame for the money their dead husbands stole. The widows band together for another heist to repay their dead husbands' debts.I thought this movie would be a dark film with heist elements. I believe adding the feminine power to it was its downfall, but it didn't take away from how good I thought it was. The story skipped along greatly, with the individual characters all being studied thoroughly, each with different lives and stories themselves. But it all maintained itself with the main plot.The movie really is what it is. I wouldn't say it's a must see, but it was damn good!8 stars",Widows

82,proud_luddite,Rather good,7,16 February 2019,"Based on the novel by Lynda La Plante: in Chicago, Veronica Rawlings (Viola Davis) is threatened by a criminal (with political ties) to come up with money her deceased husband had stolen along with his criminal colleagues, also deceased. Veronica connects with her fellow widows (played by Elizabeth Debicki and Michelle Rodriguez) who are also wrongly presumed guilty (by criminals) due to their deceased husbands's crimes. The women plan a heist of their own to solve their many problems.The current ""woke"" mindset could easily misinterpret this story (as it does with so much else) as a Sisterhood Brigade Against The Evil Patriarchy. Thankfully, everyone and everything associated with this fine film are too intelligent to go in this foolish direction.For one thing, the film is directed and co-written (with Gillian Flynn) by the thoughtful Steven McQueen who has graced the screen with such gems as ""Hunger"", ""Shame"", and ""12 Years a Slave"".For another thing, the inner circle of women are realistically like their male counterparts in similar heist films: they can't stand each other and they mistrust each other.The directing is sharp and edgy. Like most other crime films though, the story gets too busy at times and can be difficult to follow but it is comprehensible for the most part (except for the occasional mumbling).In the principal role, the always-reliable Davis is the right choice to play ""the smartest person in the room"". She also portrays the film's moral centre - this is almost a contradiction in terms considering that she plays a criminal but in Veronica's case, this is out of necessity.The ending is somewhat far-fetched but with fine performances from those mentioned plus well known stars like Colin Farrell, Daniel Kaluuya, Liam Neeson, Jackie Weaver, and Robert Duvall, ""Widows"" delivers as fine entertainment.dbamateurcritic.wordpress.om",Widows

After that three widows met each other and planned to make billion dollar heist. There are some twists in later half, but one twist I really know from the beginning, trust me. Here story was good but messy script looses its impact. Moreover heist thrill is totally missing, it should have better and in details. End is expectable not much surprised. In acting department, Viola Davis is average, Michelle Rodriguez is totally wasted not having any action scene as per her image in many action movies , why did she do such role ? Liam Nesson is average, whereas Collin Farrell is impressive. Tall actress, Elizabeth Debicki makes you to remember her and you surely watched or to be watched in latest movie, ' Tenet'.

It's obviously a great story.",Widows
86,rockman182,Widows (2018),7,18 November 2018,"I think literally everyone was hyped for what Steve McQueen was going to do next. I don't love 12 Years a Slave like everyone does but I think his previous effort Shame is such a fine film about a man plagued with a sex addiction. Widows looked to enlist a really terrific ensemble cast and bring the action and grit to a heist film. After watching it, I can say that it is a well cast and well acted slow burn. It skims on the action at times and isn't perfect but McQueen and the writing of Gilian Flynn were able to bring a perfectly enjoyable film.The film focuses on Veronica Rawlings, the wife of a renowned thief, who recently passes on a heist gone wrong. She and other widows of members of the same heist are forced to band together to retrieve money from a big job. The reason they need to do this is because they are being forced by a politician who is also a crime lord, as the original money that burned up in the aforementioned heist belonged to him. Having no experience herself, Rawlings and her crew must find ways to pull off the steal against all odds. The film is stacked with names such as Viola Davis, Elizabeth Debicki, Michelle Rodriguez, Liam Neeson, Collin Farrell and Robert DuVall to name a few.The film isn't as action packed as I thought it would be but its more of a slow burn build to the job the leading ladies must act out. The film is filled with character development, and intersecting plot lines that show how the lives of these wives intersect with the corruption of the city and a connected race in local politics. It really felt like a longer episode of The Wire. The film is well acted on all fronts. Davis is typically great but Daniel Kaluuya stepping into a despicable villainous role was also great to see. Elizabeth Debicki was a stand out as well, as she should be.McQueen is a master behind the camera as can be seen through the editing, cinematography, and relatively solid story. I say that because the film doesn't adequately wrap up the intersecting plot lines as I would have hoped. Just had a feeling that some resolutions were not adequately touched upon, which brings down the rating slightly for me.

When the rival mob comes to the Widows to get their money back, these women must band together to complete a job to get the money to save their lives.Leading this disparate group of women is Oscar winner (for FENCES) Viola Davis.

Joining her is the always tough and gritty Michelle Rodriguez and the eminently watchable Carrie Coon. The surprise performance of this group of widows is Elizabeth Debicki (the golden Ayesha in GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY 2). Her widow, Alice, is more than just the ""good-looking"" trophy wife and has a depth and gravitas that upon first glance is not something that seems to be there.

He was fascinating to watch - especially when he was doing ""nothing"" - you could see the animal swimming within him in the most still of moments.All of these actors are directed with the Orchestral efficiency of McQueen - a director who knows what he's doing. He keeps the focus of his cameras where he needs to, sometimes eschewing the most obvious action to focus our attention elsewhere. The downside to McQueen is that he sometimes gets enamored with his beautiful pictures and atmosphere, so the film gets bogged down at times - especially in the first half - but all of this is in service to the larger story - a story that demands our attention.The screenplay by McQueen and Flynn is full of plot twists and turns, of course, keeping you guessing throughout and concludes in a most satisfactory manner.All in all a very fine time at the Cineplex.

90,spookyrat1,Don't Bother Shedding Too Many Tears!,6,11 January 2019,"It's been awhile since I was so disappointed with a film that I was so looking forward to seeing. But such is the case with the critically acclaimed Widows. After viewing it, you really are left asking yourself, just what are all the accolades about?It is well cast, well-acted, well lensed, has solid general production values and director Steve McQueen does demonstrate sporadic moments of flashy talent behind the camera, such as with the already celebrated suburban Chicago drive sequence.But in a 129 minute movie, an engaging story is paramount to the overall success of the film. In this regard, Widows ends up well and truly derailed by the time we reach the film's conclusion.The movie is being marketed as an heist/action film highlighting various social justice issues. Again, in a 2 hour+ film, there is remarkably little action, with in my opinion, an over emphasis on the gender/race/political/class distinction aspects of the story, with narrative pacing paying a price. Key plot lines become less distinct, even vague, while sub-story lines are left undeveloped leaving us unsatisfied with the final outcomes.Some examples! The main plot line introduced in the first act is the Veronica /Jamal relationship. There is the ""one month to liquidate or else"" threat which hangs over Veronica the whole film and which she uses as the impetus to recruit the other ""widows"". By the third act, Jamal has pretty much disappeared from the story and the thread is seemingly forgotten about. There is never any sense of dramatic resolution between two implacably opposed foes. On a more minor level, the Belle character seems pretty irrelevant. Supposedly hired for her driving/enforcing skills/talents, we never see much of either displayed. The only significant car chase of any note, occurs in the prologue of the film. So if Belle isn't going to be involved in any action sequences, why even bother with her, as she wasn't a ""widow"" any way. The ever-so-hyped heist was over in the space of a few minutes. We never find out how Jatemme learnt when to intercept the widows and then his character's fate is so simplistically played out, as to be almost comical. The supposedly shocking big twist about two - thirds of the way through this film only adds to the narrative confusion, rather than instigating any degree of clarity.Widow's is an undoubtedly well produced, but disappointing film in my view. The mystery for me is how it managed to find its way onto so many professional critics' best films of 2018 lists.",Widows
91,joebloggscity,Great Director & actors but poor storyline hinders it all,4,5 October 2019,"Up front I've really like Steve McQueen's output to date. Shame is one of the best films i've seen in the past decade, and like many others I found 12 Years a Slave very moving. His style is very artistic but you see it all, especially the inner motions. This film is filmed with camera work in a similar fashion to 'Shame' and is as wonderfully captivating, yet it's just not a good film.I don't know about anyone else but I found the revelations to be too obvious, and some of the actors (such as Liam Neeson) were really just faxing in their acting in their roles in this film. Viola Davis is excellent and the crux of the film, but I don't feel she was well supported enough.I wasn't convinced at all of this movie and story. Simply if it wasn't for the director & cast, this would easily have shifted into being a Sunday TV film of some sort.Just a disappointment, and little to recommend it for.",Widows
92,bob-the-movie-man,Death becomes her,9,10 November 2018,"If you are considering ""inheritence planning"" there are probably a number of things you might be toying with: what happens to your house; how to best transfer your investments; who gets the dog; etc. But probably ""a grudge"" is not on the list. But that's the problem faced by teacher's union rep Veronica (Viola Davis). As you might presume from the film's title Veronica, together with fellow widows Linda (Michelle Rodriquez), Alice (Elizabeth Debicki), Amanda (Carrie Coon), are left in a tight spot when a gang's robbery of a local black hoodlum's stack of cash goes badly wrong. The leader of the gang, and Veronica's husband, is Harry Rawlings (Liam Neeson), and his certain set of skills are not enough to save him.The victim of the robbery, Jamal Manning (Brian Tyree Henry), is running for local office in the upcoming elections against Jack Mulligan (Colin Farrell), trying to take over the role as part of a long dynasty from his grouchy father Tom (Robert Duvall). Where Jamal might be better with words, Jamal's brother Jatemme (Daniel Kaluuya, ""Get Out"") has a more physical approach to resolving issues.What Harry has left behind for Veronica is a notebook containing the details of their next job, and Veronica gathers the female group together to carry out the raid to help save them from a ""bullet in the head"".I really enjoyed this film. It's the ying to the yang of the disappointing ""Ocean's 8"" from earlier in the year. Yes, it's YET another film that focuses on female empowerment and with a strong black presence within the cast. But what for me made it stand out above the crowd was the quality of the writing and the assuredness of the directing.Although based on the ancient UK TV series by Lynda La Plante, the script is written by ""Gone Girl"" screenwriter Gillian Flynn, and is excellent. It really doesn't EXPLAIN what is going on, but shows you a series of interconnected scenes and lets you mentally fill in the blanks. While you don't need to be a rocket scientist to understand the overall story arc, I must admit that even now I'm not 100% sure of some of the nuances of the story. Harry, for example, seems to be a hardened career criminal, and yet he seems to be revered by the political leaders on both sides, even though he seemed to have loyalty to noone. The script cleverly uses flashbacks and has enough twists and turns to keep you on your mental toes.The characters also worked well for me, with each having a back story and motivations that were distinctly different from each other. Alice (helped by Debecki's standout performance) is particularly intriguing coming out of an 'interesting' relationship. Is she just following the path of her unpleasant mother (Jacki Weaver)? Some of the actions might suggest so.As for the direction, Steve McQueen (he of ""12 Years a Slave""), delivers some scenes that could justly be described as ""bold"". A highpoint for me was a short drive by Jack Mulligan and his PA Siobhan (an excellently underplayed Molly Kunz) from a housing project, in a neighbourhood you might worry about walking through at night, to the Mulligan mansion in a leafy and pleasant street. McQueen mounts the camera on the bonnet (hood) of the car, but you can't see the interior other than occasional glimpses of the chauffeur. All you can hear is Mulligan's rant to his Siobhan. I thought this worked just brilliantly well. The heist itself well done and suitably tense with an outcome that continues to surprise.If there's a criticism then the ending rather fizzles out, leaving a few loose ends flapping in the breeze.As for the performances, it's only been a couple of weeks since my review of the excellent ""Bad Times at the El Royale"" and I named as my second film of the year for my (private) ""Ensemble Cast"" award. And here hot on its tail is the third. There are such strong performances across the cast that it's difficult to pull out specifics: as you start looking at the list you pull out more and more and more names...As referenced above, I loved Elizabeth Debecki's performance. Both vulnerable and strong all in one package.Colin Farrell, for me, gives his best performance in years as the son caught within the shadow of his overpowering father. A confrontational scene between Farrell and Robert Duvall is particularly powerful.Daniel Kaluuya is truly threatening (possibly slightly OTT) as the psycho fixer.For the second time in a month Cynthia Erivo stands out as a major acting force, as the hairstylist cum gang member Belle.Jon Michael Hill, excellent as a fire-breathing reverend with flexible political views.It would not surprise me to see Best Supporting Actor nods for any combinations of Debecki, Farrell, Kaluuya and Erivo for this.I must admit that I'm not the greatest fan of Viola Davis: I find her performances quite mannered. But there's no doubting here the depth of her passion and with this lead performance she carries this film.Final Thoughts: I loved this as an intelligent action movie that's a cut above the rest. Which is a surprise, since from the trailer I thought it looked good but not THAT good! It comes with my recommendation for an exciting and gripping two hours at the cinema.(For the full graphical review, please check out One Mann's Movies on Facebook. Thanks).",Widows

94,silvermistvio,A different version of Liam Neeson.,8,18 May 2019,"Widows is something different I've seen. The reason why I watched this film because of Liam Neeson. But I found out that this one is very different. Very different from Liam's previous films. He's kind of a bad guy in this film. I think that is also good. We finally get to see some evil side of Liam.Some people might feel the black and white marriage is something offensive. But as for me, it's still okay as long as they are not threat to other people. No offence. Furthermore, we're all human after all. So, it's nothing bad or something like that.This film tells you about one word. Greed. Greed is something that can change the whole life. Greed can blind your eyes. Greed can make you do anything that you shouldn't do. If we can't control it, we humans are not different from animals. So, we have to limit it. We shouldn't go beyond which we can't control.Although this film is quite enjoyable, but I don't quite like they put kissing scene at the very beginning. Imagine that if you were expecting something exciting and saw the kissing scene instead, how would you feel? I felt like it's disgusting, disappointing and also amazed. So, if they made a good start rather than kissing scene, it'd be better.At some point, the film is kind of predictable. I guessed that dog would bark at the door when Veronica put her dog down to the door and it started to walk to somewhere. If nothing is unpredictable, it'd be better also.The kissing scene of Harry and Veronica is so disgusting. I'm not saying that I don't like kissing scenes but when I saw that scene, I felt like it's so disgusting. If only they could do better to that scene.At the end of the film, there's a scene where Veronica and Alice reunited. When I saw this scene, I felt that something's missing. I felt like there should be Linda too. She was one of them anyway. Three of them or all four are united in the final scene, it can be said that it's a happy ending.What I don't get is the way Marcus died. Why the hell did those police officers shoot Marcus without making sure what he's doing? And also I don't understand why Veronica said to Harry that Marcus would still be alive if black and white married. Really made me confused.All in all, Widows is kind of into some kind of drama, but if you're kind of Liam Neeson's fan, it'd be a good film to enjoy.",Widows
95,lopezpatricia-06139,A BIT RACIST. BUT GOOD FILM,8,19 January 2021,"I have to say I did notice a smattering of racism which I'm getting a little fed up of with Hollywood. Why are all white people portrayed as racist. I don't recall this in the original. Viola says ""I should never have married a white man"" what so a black man career criminal would have been preferable? What!! Colin Farrell as the typical Irish American racist with a worse father. It's not necessary for this plot. The scene where their son is shot by police because he was driving a nice car. Irritating! As if that happens every day. The African American characters were just as violent as the white characters. So I'd advise not to draw attention to this. If the boot was on the other foot we'd never hear the end of it. I've made no friends with this review but I don't care it needs to be said . Otherwise a really good reboot of the original. Watch out for Anne Mitchell's cameo. That was cool.",Widows
96,tonypeacock-1,"Interesting heist job, Worthy of a viewing.",7,14 November 2019,"Based on a 1980s Lynda La Plante TV drama set in London which I had no knowledge of. The location is switched to Chicago which made a change from the usual U.S. New York/Los Angeles locales.Director Steve McQueen is someone I have admired for his work such as 12 Years A Slave in 2013 and Hunger back in 2008. He never shys away from uncomfortable film subjects.In Widows a group of 4 women left behind by their dead husbands in a heist gone wrong use the plans of their next 'job' to do the heist themselves. The film has an excellent cast including Liam Neeson, Colin Farrell, Michelle Rodriguez, Viola Davis and Robert Duvall. Duvell plays an old, slightly racist retired politician and a local election campaign forms a plotline in the film.It has the structure of a typical heist movie. The recruitment of a gang by ringleader Viola Davis. The planning of the robbery including the need for a getaway driver and the mastermind. Unsympathetic shady local politicians replace the bankers depicted in recent heist movies.",Widows
97,kjproulx,A Very Solid Piece of Entertainment,8,30 November 2018,"A great heist film always gets me excited, as the intricacies that can be put into those stories can make for a fantastic film. From movies like Heat to newer movies like The Town, this genre has always had me yearning for the next great one. While I don't believe Widows quite fits into the conversation with the two aforementioned films, I believe the audience will absolutely get their fill with this one. Director Steve McQueen has directed critically acclaimed films like Shame and even directed a film to win best picture in 12 Years a Slave, and although I don't personally believe you'll be seeing very much of this film around the coming awards circuit, here's why I believe it's worthy of seeing in theaters.A heist has gone wrong. Four women have been left without husbands and to protect their own lives and families, they decide to complete the unfinished job that had been set in motion by their late partners. With the addition of a politician (which I won't get into detail on), it adds a few needed layers for the overall story. This film's premise has the potential to be incredibly emotionally resonant, but I feel as those the first act of this film shoots down any real emotional impact that the ending of the film could've had.The heist that kicks off the film feels incredibly rushed and I understand that the point of the movie is to focus on the four widows themselves, but the fact that the deaths of their husbands is brushed over left no room for emotion in my opinion. The husbands should have been more fleshed out so that audiences can get attached to every character before their demise. This was the films biggest downfall in my opinion, but it left a pretty big hole in my overall experience of this movie. I wish I had cared more about who lived and who died.The biggest thing Widows has working in its favour is the fact that Steve McQueen is a very talented filmmaker and the trio of writing talents with McQueen, Gillian Flynn, and Lynda La Plante was fantastic. This movie is full of surprises and I feel as though many viewers will have their jaw on the floor on a couple different occasions, but as I said, the emotional impact of everything is slightly lost, due to how brief the opening of the film is. Sadly, this is a rare case where I feel that most of this movie could be looked at as the best film of 2018, but the first act really taints those praises for me.On top of the well-written screenplay and overall great direction, this cast is stacked from head to toe. From Viola Davis giving an always devoted performance to Michelle Rodriguez giving her all, to relative newcomers in Cynthia Erivo and Elizabeth Debicki, to even Colin Ferrel and Robert Duvall who always do their thing on-screen, I was blown away by this cast. I would mention the performances of the husbands, but as I said, they're very brief. If it wasn't for these three elements, I don't believe I would've enjoyed this premise as much as I did.In the end, this is a very, very solid film that had the potential to be a great one. Not enough development is given to anyone to truly care about who makes it out of these situations. Steve McQueen is a director whom I will follow until his very last film entry because he's just that talented and Widows isn't a slight to that statement whatsoever. Although surprising and well-structured, this movie does feel like it's missing something and I feel an additional 20 minutes in the first act may have had me loving the film as a whole. Overall, Widows is a very good time at the movies and I recommend checking it out.",Widows

This is the story of four widows with nothing in common except a $2 million debt left by their dead husbands. A slow burning drama with an additional political sub-plot, where (strangely) we see the black and white led parties have both good and bad motivations.McQueen takes his time to flesh out the female characters through flash-back scenes, they follow the meticulous plans to their husband's next job, and we see how they carefully prepare for this.There's a lot to like but the film is overlong and left me unsatisfied.

Its not your typical heist film, but rather a film About Grieve and how People handle their grieve. Its one of the better films of the year mostly thanks to a fantastic cast and a very solid and controlled direction by Steve McQueen. His follow up project to ""12 Years a Slave"" convinces in all matters, and is absolutely different in Content, style and Storytelling.
Viola Davis shines. There is no better way to describe her fantastic Performance. I am so happy for her she got the lead in such Major film and was able to o beyond with her Performance compared to how the character was written. Another great Performance came from Elizabeth Debicki who I have under my radar for quite some time now and who was finally be able to prove her Talent. Michelle Rodriguez also gave a very memorable Performance.
Unfortunately great Talents like Carrie Coon and once again Jacki Weaver were rather wasted and their characters went rather nowhere.
Liam Neeson was okay but overacted his final Scene too hard. You have a nice male cast with a decent Colin Farrell and a great Robert Duvall but the ones that stand out most are definitely Daniel Kaluuya and Brian Tyree Henry. The score was thrilling and the style and editing abolutely functional.

106,Beejerman,JUST OKAY - (5 stars out of 10),5,23 March 2019,"The stage curtains open ...Interesting premise for a heist film - ""Widows"" showcases some fine acting chops from some big names in the film industry: Viola Davis, Liam Neeson, Robert Duvall, Colin Farrell, and Michelle Rodriguez. What happens when 4 criminals are killed in police crossfire? Their widows plan a heist.And that's how our story starts. A botched robbery attempt ends in the deaths of a thief and his partners, which also burns up $2 million which was to be used to finance the campaign of electoral hopeful, Jamal Manning. Manning isn't going to take this lying down though, so he pays a visit to the thief's widow and tells her that she will pay his debt, or else. She finds her husband's notebook detailing a heist that will pay out $5 million - so she recruits the other widows to plan and pull off the heist.If you are going in to this film expecting something as slick as Ocean's Eleven, its not here. This is not really a heist film as much as it is a crime film about a heist. The problem I have with ""Widows"" is that it is so laden down with heavy drama and acting that it drowns out the excitement of the heist itself. By the time they actually got to the heist, I was ready for the movie to be over. As I mentioned to begin with, the acting was excellent. The characters were all very real and flawed. The dynamics between Farrell and Duvall were very good, and in one scene, simply gut wrenching. And there is a little twist at the end to keep things interesting right up until the final credits roll.I can't really say this is a recommend. It was okay. I didn't feel it was anything special. If you want a good crime drama with political elements thrown into it, then you would enjoy this.

You can tell the man behind the camera is all about visual storytelling...an artist as opposed to a blockbuster machine. If every crime drama was filmed like this, well, I would probably watch a lot more of them (and so would others). This is what movie making should be: get some great actors, find a compelling story with tons of twists/conflict, and then film it well. No super heroes needed, and no Oscar bait either. Just gripping drama. Also, as a Chicagoan, I loved seeing a story that was all about power, race, and class in our city, but managed to not be didactic.

From the incredible ensemble cast to Steve McQueen directing and writing alongside Gillian Flynn, the writer of Gone Girl. Everything was in place to make this film as amazing as it could be but sadly that wasn't the case. Widows is by no means a bad film. There are certainly aspects I really like but I was pretty disappointed by the end.There were many great moments in Widows which I liked. The film opens with a beautiful sequence of events as we see the relationship each woman has with their husband interspliced with the botched heist involving the husbands. I loved the contrast between the two and, the heist especially, is shot really well. It's chaotic, intense and a fantastic opening to the film. Another brilliant scene is when we see Colin Farrell's character go into a car with his assistant as they talk. The film could have cut to them talking inside but McQueen decides to keep the camera focused on the background as we travel from a poor neighbourhood to a rich one. I admire McQueen's unconventional method of showing this scene as it also gave us some interesting social commentary. Scenes involving Daniel Kaluuya really stood out to me. It's been a while since I've seen a villain that felt so menacing and brutal. This was someone I genuinely felt scared of. His performance was so good and different from what I've seen him do previously.The female performances were all fantastic. Viola Davis and Elizabeth Debicki stand out in particular. There is a lot of emotional baggage with Davis as we learn over the course of the film and she does a great job with it. I have to commend Debicki a lot as she plays such a complex character. It's the best I've seen her. It's nice to see Michelle Rodriguez in something other than Fast and Furious and she also does a great job. For her film debut, I was impressed with Cynthia Erivo. Colin Farrell is terrific as politician Jack Mulligan as well as Robert Duvall playing his father. Brian Tyree Henry and Liam Neeson also do a great job. This is a very strong ensemble where everyone gives it their best.However, there are features of Widows that I felt could have been better. McQueen and Flynn want to say so much about men, women, poverty, wealth, politics and race that I feel they weren't able to explore them as well as they could have. It seemed like they tried too hard to fit in all these messages in its 2 hour 10 minute runtime. In addition, the film moves at a slow pace. It moved way too slow for my liking and I started to lose interest after a while. The actual heist itself that the film was building up to didn't have that excitement factor for me. I wasn't able to feel the tension and stakes of the entire sequence which disappointed me.There are some great scenes in Widows that showcase the calibre of Steve McQueen but I was left underwhelmed unfortunately. It's well made technically with strong performances but I think McQueen and Flynn aimed too high with this one.",Widows
109,Azanspy,Widows is Ocean's 8 turned dark.,8,27 January 2019,"Widows is undoubtedly an enjoyable movie with good messages. Steve McQueen has done a great job by keeping the movie slow but an entertaining heist movie. Performance wise, Viola Davis, Daniel Kalluya, Elizabeth Debicki and Cynthia Erivo has done a great job and all others did an okay job. Overall, Widows is not an ordinary heist movie but it is definitely an enjoyable flick.",Widows
110,statuskuo,"The Female ""Heat""",7,16 November 2018,"Aside from the lack of a final ear shattering, pulse pounding shootout with the cops, this heist film has that same tone as Michael Mann's ""Heat""
The setup is fairly simple, after a botched robbery that ends in four men dying, the widows of the men ban together to get the money back to the men they stole from or face the wrath of a local gangster turned politician. A lot of insight into corrupt Chicago politics which shines a light on what inner city Democrats really stand for. And it's everything we expect. But that's not this story. The women are left to pick up their past from these men who chose a criminal lifestyle. Poor choices. Though they're left with surviving.
What I love about this film is the chutzpah of women doing something traditionally meant for men. Armed robbery is not easy lifting. Much like ""Set It Off"", they rely on crafty women who have nothing left to lose.
I'm not traditionally an advocate for women committing these types of crimes, because they always feel a little staged. But this is much more raw. While there are many moments where it does rely on the viewer to suspend a little bit of common sense, I found it to be emotionally riveting.
Yes, there will be a lot of criticism about the history of these women. But I think they give you just enough to care about them.
There are many questions left unanswered, and this will irritate many people. I like siding with these tough cookies.",Widows
111,davidgee,More caper than crime story,6,22 November 2018,"Despite some talky scenes, WIDOWS moves at a fairly cracking pace, with car chases and killings paving the way to plot twists that add to the echoes of last summer's all-girl OCEAN'S 8. More caper than crime story, this version of WIDOWS replaces the gritty realism of the 1980s UK TV series with high-gloss violence and the kind of villains we have seen all too often - corrupt politicos and vicious crimelords. Liam Neeson's Harry is a minor variation on his overdone TAKEN character, and although her performance is first-rate, Viola Davis's Veronica lacks the quiet fury of Ann Mitchell's Dolly Rawlins in 1983.Worth watching? Yeah, but I'd rather see the TV series again.",Widows
112,andrewroy-04316,"While Widows is ambitious and has strong performances from a great cast, it doesn't land a thrilling heist or a deep social commentary",6,20 October 2019,"Everything about Widows sounds absolutely perfect on paper. Steve McQueen is directing it, coming off the absolute masterpiece of 12 Years A Slave, it's a heist thriller, and it has a stacked cast. While it is not a disappointment on the technical fronts, the script is way overstuffed and doesn't really nail any one element. The heist was much less of a focus than I anticipated, with the real focus of the movie being on the personal side of Chicago crime. The pace was fairly patient, focused on many individuals and their internal struggles. Flynn and McQueen certainly tried to work many elements into the movie, with female empowerment and political machinations as the biggest themes, but so many others were shoehorned in (police violence, emotional grieving) that it didn't feel focused. There were also so many characters they tried to give full backstories and arcs to that I felt completely cold and emotionally detached from all the characters. Kaluuya was amazing in a supporting role, stealing every scene he was in with his psychopathic performance, and Davis was great in the lead. The cinematography was also awesome - a shot where Colin Farrell is leaving a rally and the camera shows the outside of the car and we see the setting transform from the poor area he was in to the rich area he lives in was excellent. The twist was certainly unexpected but added no deeper meaning and isn't particularly creative in its execution or idea. The heist felt like an afterthought that didn't hold much weight. It's a movie that tries to do a lot but ends up being ineffective in almost all areas. Much like Nocturnal Animals, it would be one of my favorite movies on paper but despite strong performances doesn't have anything worth contemplating when the movie ends.",Widows
113,sbweightman,"Hard hitting drama, strong acting and a solid plot.",9,10 November 2018,"An engaging movie with hard hitting drama and strong acting from all of the cast. Although a heist story, it focuses more on the other elements involved - politics, corruption, greed, revenge and empowerment for women and black Americans.

114,bgar-80932,Dissapointing,6,4 September 2019,I'm not sure what it is about this film but something doesn't quite click. It's a thriller but it never really felt like that. The acting is good enough so I'm assuming it's the directing or the script. It felt like it was building to something and it did in a way but it was a bit uninspired to me. I may be giving this a worse score than it deserves because I was actually hyped for it but I think this is reasonable still. Also I don't know why but it bothered me that the main girl kept bringing her dog around lol. It was just weird.,Widows
115,rachelrose-87356,Movie Review Profits,8,8 August 2019,Play Widows! It is fast and easy to view! A good way to spend your time. Be the best!,Widows
116,CinematicInceptions,Please make more movies like this.,8,7 April 2019,"I won't recommend this movie too strongly in itself, but I really wanted to pay for it and I would encourage other people to pay for it because this is the kind of movie that I want there to be more of: something original with talented filmmakers and actors working on it that cares about its story and tries to use it to tackle social issues without detracting from its plot or characters. It's true that Widows didn't quite stick the landing in this regard and maybe tried to take on a little too much, however, I would like to defend it for a moment by trying to give Gillian Flynn and Steve McQueen the benefit of the doubt. From Gone Girl, I know that Gillian Flynn is perhaps the best novel writer this side of JK Rowling and the best screenwriter this side of Aaron Sorkin. I haven't seen any of Steve McQueen's other movies, but I could tell that he is skilled as a director from his work here. Since this movie hardly showcased the full extent of either creator's talents, I am going to assume that they were pressed for time in production. Whether this is true, I don't know, but I got the sense that this could have been as good as something like The Departed or LA Confidential if there had been more time put into it (and if it had come out about fifteen years earlier).That said, I do agree that this was a little bit of a letdown. However, I did think it gave its main characters respect and did a good job with following their respective arcs. Each of the women involved in the heist felt unique and three-dimensional. We didn't get too much insight into any of their psyches, but there were a few points where I could tell that Flynn and McQueen had taken the care to figure out what their characters were thinking and feeling in a specific moment, even if it wasn't made totally clear to the audience. It's true that none of the characters in this movie are all that compelling, but every one of them that gets more than a couple of minutes on screen feels real.None of the actors give career defining performances, but they still do a good job in terms of playing their characters truthfully. It was disappointing to see Daniel Kaluuya in such a small role after his stellar performance in Get Out. I think the same could probably be said about Viola Davis, though I have never been able to appreciate her the way that most people do. However, Michelle Rodriguez and Elizabeth Debicki gave surprisingly good performances compared to their roles in Fast and Furious and Man From UNCLE respectively.The plot wasn't bad, but as I said before it definitely could have been better. The crime thriller genre is one that tends to rely a lot on a good plot with a lot of thought put into it. Widows is free of plot holes, but beyond that, it seems like the nuts and bolts plot was not a primary focus. There weren't any major reversals in terms of the heist, leaving more time to focus on each of the characters. The ending might feel unsatisfying for some people, but I think it actually succeeds in wrapping up the subtle theme of mourning that is laced throughout the movie. Despite the events of the movie having run their course and the heist having succeeded, there isn't any indication of this being a happy ending. But there is a sense that all of our heroines are going to be okay and are now ready to make new lives for themselves.If you thought that this movie looked good, I would recommend that you see it. Not necessarily because you will like it if you liked the trailer, but because the only way that more movies like this will be made and more care will be put into them is if audiences support them. I know that makes it sound like it's not a good movie, but I hope that I have been able to express in the above paragraphs that it is good, just with some room for improvement. At the very least, it took a few risks, and even though not all of those risks paid off, I still applaud Flynn and McQueen for taking them. Overall Rating: 7.7/10.",Widows

118,roxmewild,Disappointing waste of a good cast,2,7 February 2019,"I really had high hopes for this movie with a cast of such talent,however it did not deliver and I think some actors will regret unless their pay cheque was good?
The concept of the story was different in as much as the male criminal husbands all died during a robbery Barr Liam and the wives due to financial circumstances decided to do a robbery.
Sadly the script writing appeared to be a rush job the storyline under thought and written with as much depth as a puddle!
The characters were not developed the robbery so riddicously planned and executed it was comical why bother with John bernthal if you give him a 60 second part in the film, Liam Neesons had a larger part which was made up of flashbacks to him and his partner Robert Duvall at best was a 10 min part and Colin Farrell only slightly more involved . With a more thought out plot and script writing this could have been so much better.
Just seems the budget went on a cast and not the story etc

120,Offworld_Colony,"Widows is a slow, seductive and brooding movie with a rich 70's Sorcerer vibe and a burning, pervading depth.",10,12 February 2020,"Killer actors and a brilliant set up let McQueen's political eye for framing and Gillian Flynn's tack-sharp script to pounce on everything from power, deception, inheritance, legacy, race, money, the sexes, and a million more things.
Based on the trailers I wondered why McQueen decided to make an action, heist thriller that looked no different to the enjoyable but shallow Triple Frontiers and Triple 9's and The Town's; films masquerading as holding a message but really just holding their own swinging dicks. But Widows is a different machine, it's ice cool but it's never actually cool and it's concerned more with taking a slice of the world and examining it through a lens, not just shooting it up.
It's a thoroughly unique feeling heist film and refuses to fall into many of the cliches of its forebears, all except for Daniel Kaluuya's bloodthirsty intimidating henchman, I long for the day when I see this role in a way that doesn't seem like an over-the-top joke.
Viola Davis' ruthless focus, Elizabeth Debicki's damaged chameleon, her eyes almost red with nerves and Michelle Rodriguez's shuttered, layered character, they are all dynamite.
Widows is a Steve McQueen film through and through and I'm pleasantly surprised and will absolutely need to rewatch this film for its nuances. Right at the start there's a shop in a run-down neighbourhood called ""Rothschild's"", immediately it makes a connection between last names, inheritance, poverty, luck, deception, conspiracy and identity. And Widow's four leading ladies that have inherited not just (in some cases) last names from their partners, but also so much more. It's just an example of McQueen's deft touch to the smallest details that build into the whole.
On top of that I've never wanted anyone to succeed in a heist more. They're not adrenaline junkies or misguided robbers with a warped code of ethics, they are the downtrodden and the disenfranchised forced to break character and raise up a level. And when the heist kicks in and it's dirty and fast and simple and mercifully short I'm genuinely relieved.
It's a throwback modern classic, it's the Heat that the world needs right now.
They fought to buy their independence and their lives back not for fame or dollar or artifice. They worked for their freedom. It's powerful stuff.",Widows
121,HEFILM,"unconvincing, overlong, ineptly directed, pretenious",2,9 December 2018,"It's certainly fine for directors to get a chance to make different types of films but that doesn't mean they will be good at every genre, and McQueen proves that here.Neither the drama, nor the heist are convincing, there is no sense of suspense to what feels like a very very long movie.It paints a totally ugly picture of Chicago--that might even be considered a plus factor as at least that's part of what it intends to do.There are so many elements to this, you'd need a master to possible pull it off, though you'd need a better script as well, what Don Siegel might have done with this. Some of the angles don't cut together very well and a key flashback is almost handled confusingly. There are some self consciously over long shots and moments, a very film school-like close up of a cigarette is practically a parody of a film student making a noir film.The actors try hard but that's not enough to connect the dots of the plot, but the reasons these widows join up never makes total sense to start with so you never have much to build upon right from the start and the ending leaves a lot of loose ends.Everyone is pretty nasty and nasty to each other, leaves no reason to root for anybody, though the film just seems to be going nowhere as slowly as possible.One good plot twist has little or no impact and the various political points I guess the film would like to make take up enough time to leave out any time to develop the heist segment.Very sparse sort of Morriconesque music score by Zimmer.The whole thing is a let down.",Widows

I was shifting uncomfortably in my seat along with many others in the theater. i thought this could done a lot better i mean i don't hate this movie at all just because it's women fact is because movie is slow, boring, story takes so much time just to get to point nothing interesting at all. i never understand why this got 7.5 because of performance and plot twist was eh they did that all movies when you watch this film you seen the twist happening before then to this your like oh this is samething as happened before like another movies, nothing special and Colin Farrell i loved S.W.A.T, Miami Vice,i liked Dead Man Down,he plays a snake politician who wants no part in the family business, but already seems to be getting far too involved out of choice. he wasn't much in film sadly he was their but not much to tell about his character. Michelle Rodriguez i love her i am fan of her i loved fast and furious franchise, i liked resident evil, i loved Assignment i liked most of her movies but this really ? if she was lead i would like this little bit more but eh she doesn't save this movie at all. story really follows A police shootout leaves four thieves dead during an explosive armed robbery attempt in Chicago 4 robbery's Harry Rawlings (Liam Nesson) who is wife to Veronica (Viola Davis) and Florek (Jon Bernthal) wife to Alice (Elizabeth Debicki) Carlos

Jamal needs the money to finance his electoral campaign for alderman of a South Side precinct, where he is running against Jack Mulligan (Colin Farrell), the next-in-line of the Mulligan political family who have historically dominated the alderman position. then Veronica hires Linda, Alice to be in heist team, and it's a biggest risk of what they got to take. and another actor (Daniel Kaluuya) Jatemme Manning, Jamal's brother and mob enforcer know for Get out aka Get out of my face, Sicario. now he is alright as mob i wished it could been a different movie with him in it but he was good in film. then in all movie is just eh nothing special got boring 2 hours wasted almost went for 3 hours too long for 2h 9min long film god their scenes would be good to be cut off completely make it a fast paced film not a slower film. it's too long, toke too much time i thought this was time, this was a very slow burning time film i didn't hate it as bad i thought twist didn't see it coming but i thought movie just sucked it was boring nothing to it i loved Michelle Rodriguez role but nothing else 3.10 could been better and director Steve McQueen wanna be of actor Steve McQueen. director of this movie is not right director could been Michael Mann or Christian Gudegast or scott mann for film i thought this was slowing me down, not much is happening, it could of been a simple plot, pace goes slaright forward. please stop believing reviewer saying actors mega cast oh it was fantastic twist you won't see it coming samething goes over and over AGAIN. 3.10 just watch it in Netflix it wasn't worth it to see in theater.",Widows
125,stevenrotherforth,Very little thrill for a thriller,6,15 June 2019,"WidowsWidows is a crime thriller that tells the story of four women who are forced to deal with debt left behind by their dead criminal husbands.
Directed by Steve McQueen this movie is slow but remains mostly captivating due to some skilful direction and masterful performances by the lead female cast.
Viola Davis heads the group with Michelle Rodriguez,Elizebeth Debecki and Cynthia Erivo offering fine support.
The remaining cast is somewhat stellar too with Liam Neeson, Colin Farrell and Robert Duvall to name but a few.
However I am not one that was bowled over by this movie despite acquiring some impressive reviews by many critics.
Whilst I was invested in the plot I was never fully entertained or satisfied.
Widows is a depressing looking movie.
Even in HDR this is a dull film.
McQueen does some wonderful things with the camera in terms of inventive shots and angles but by the time credits rolled I was left a little cold.
I don't know if it was how this movie was paced or if I was expecting more action and less drama.
I can't fault any of the performances or McQueens talented direction. The script is well written but there's no excitement.

It's based on a British TV mini-series from the early 1980s, written by Lynda La Plante (most famous for Prime Suspect); from it, Steve McQueen has fashioned a film that grips like vice, that draws brilliant performances from its cast and touches on weighty themes. Grief is a big thing - one of the best portrayals of the reality of losing someone you love I've seen on screen; Viola Davis inhabits even the smallest of gestures with worlds of pain. It's a heist film that likes to unpredictably subvert familiar genre tropes, and when the film moves into action sequences, they are masterfully staged. It's no exaggeration to say that this film has the moral, intellectual and emotional complexity of Heat - a film I more admire than I love - without sacrificing any plot-based tension; for me, it may even be better than that film for the fact that whereas Heat backgrounds female characters too much for me, and in Widows there is less of the self-concious 'actorliness' that I felt occasionally undermined Heat.

130,kgprophet,Too Slow Pacing Leaves Audience Impatient,5,25 November 2018,"This review contains only one minor spoiler.The superlative reviews and reputation of director Steve McQueen already set the stage where the purpose of this film was to feature performances by accomplished actors. But I like heist thrillers a lot. So the added perk to watching this film was to see the story unfold of this daring heist perpetrated by the most unlikely group of people.The plot unfolds very slowly. There are a few moving parts to the caper and the politics behind it. There were many times where it seemed an objective should have been dealt with and the plot moves on. Instead it gets bogged down way before the stakes really build. Running over 2 hours, there were places I felt the pacing could have been tightened up, and the initial steps to where our protagonist starts the ball rolling on the new caper could happen quicker.Minor SpoilerFor instance, Veronica, the one who comes up with the idea of pulling this new heist, asks her ex-husband's driver the addresses of the other 3 widows. This should have been accomplished very quickly, being that the driver would know the other people in the original gang. But in this movie it takes too long to get to the next step.End Minor SpoilerIt's a very slow reveal of the parts of a puzzle needed to be solved of where the location of the next planned heist is. Again, expectations were already addressed beforehand that this was not a straight-out heist thriller, but more a character drama that expands the world the main characters live in. It provides backstory for the four widows and sets the stakes for why the widows need to do what they do. But in the end it is impossible to setup a large amount of groundwork for a heist thriller, but to keep the pace at a slow boil to allow character background.To that end, a normal heist thriller would have a music soundtrack for more than 25% of the film. In this film there is no music at all until the actual heist in the third act. Even then it is the Jason Bourne repetitive 16th note arpeggio (or in this case basic percussion). As the film started to drag in places for me, I felt that some proper musical cues would go a long way to help connect the emotion of the moment on screen to the viewer watching in the audience. It very well could have been a budget compromise, or perhaps a conscious choice to enhance the idea of a documentary style reality of the movie. Although there are many gritty real locations utilised around Chicago, the story elements still only exist in the fictional movie world. The cinematography is steady and mostly not very flashy, and certainly does not have a documentary look to it. The ensemble of characters, all with skeletons in their closets, are figments of the thriller genre, and the attempts to flesh these characters out are limited because of these required tropes.Like a good thriller, a few good twists are thrown in. For me, these are good twists but are few and far between again due to the slow pacing. Then there is the actual heist, which I was honestly starting to wonder whether it is was actually going to occur, (perhaps a big surprise twist for an ending?) But yes, the heist goes down, but ironically the buildup and execution of the heist itself is basically shorthand, where everything unfolds faster than real time. I ultimately would have a hard time recommending this movie as a character drama, again because the slow pacing had the audience ahead of how quickly the story was unfolding.",Widows
131,jamiedarlow-37510,It's ambition falls short but there are cool performances,4,20 February 2020,"The latest from director Steve McQueen (12 Years A Slave, Shame) and writer Gillian Flynn (Gone Girl) follows three women who have tragically been widowed after their husbands are killed in a heist gone wrong. In order to pay off the debt her husband left behind, Veronica (Viola Davis) teams up with Linda (Michelle Rodriguez) and Alice (Elizabeth Debicki) to pull off the next big steal their partners were planning. It's very much an ensemble cast and it's safe to say that the cast is absolutely top notch; Davis is great as always, Rodriguez is a breath of fresh air to see in something other than a Fast and Furious film and Debicki does very well portraying someone who has been abused before and is not going to take it again; whether it's from a spouse or her mother (Jacki Weaver). Liam Neeson is very good as Harry and it's quite a welcome return to his more dramatic roles. Daniel Kaluuya also does a brilliant job of portraying a completely unnerving psychopath. The film sadly doesn't have a lot more going for it other than those elements; it has too many plot strands which seem to go in random ways at points and characters such as politicians Jack and Tom Mullagan (played by Colin Farrell and Robert Duvall) are just a needless distraction from what should be the core interest of the story; the three women at the heart of it. As a result of the switching around, not enough character development is spent on the three or indeed anybody and therefore it's very hard to get invested (Kevin J O'Connor for example is also great but we know any minute the scene is going to randomly switch to another character and any emotional attachments we can make are not given time to breath) Cynthia Erivo is also sadly underused as Belle and I would've liked to have seen much more of her backstory. Overall, if you're a fan of the performers it's worth a look but its ambition is also its downfall; perhaps wait until it's on tv",Widows
132,dr_clarke_2,Widows proves that McQueen can make big budget Hollywood-style action movies with considerable style,8,26 October 2021,"Director Steve McQueen followed up 12 Years a Slave with something rather different, a film remake of a British television serial written by Lynda La Plante, which in contrast to all of his previous films is an action-packed heist thriller. Despite that however, it still retains his characteristic thoughtfulness.Widows follow the titular women, whose professional criminal husbands are killed during a heist gone wrong. When a crime boss decides that they owe him two million dollars, they decide to carry out a job to pay him off, and soon become mired in a web of political scheming, organised crime, and betrayal. There are numerous twists and turns, one of which anyone familiar with La Plante's original series and its sequel will be able to guess, and there's a real sense of danger, and a gritty realism that isn't always present in heist movies. McQueen co-wrote the screenplay with American writer and author Gillian Flynn, and whilst many films of the genre have a tongue-in-cheek sense of fun, Widows makes a life of crime simply look terrifying and dangerous. What it does have in common with other heist movies is a fascination with the meticulously planning involved, which proves gripping.The ensemble cast is led by Viola Davis as Veronica Rawlings, Michelle Rodriguez as Linda, Elizabeth Debicki as Alice, and Carrie Coon as Amanda, whilst support is provided by the likes of Colin Farrell, Robert Duvall and Lima Neeson. Daniel Kaluuya convincingly plays psychotic gangland enforcer Jatemme Manning, whose lurking presence throughout the film considerable adds to the tension, whilst Brian Tyree Henry exudes quiet menace from beneath an affable facade as his older brother Jamal. It's a bigger cast with a greater number of prominent roles than in McQueen's previous films, and he proves more than capable of directing his actors to give entirely believable performances.McQueen also proves more than capable of handling large-scale action set pieces, which this film boasts several of. However, his background as an artist remains apparent in every meticulously composed shot, with the camera lingering on ornaments, paintings and patches of damp to establish a sense of place in every scene. The film is shot on location in Chicago and the film makes great use of the cityscape. The cinematography from Sean Bobbitt helps, and he provides some notable shots including the scene in which the camera revolves around Kaluuya's Jatemme as he shoots a rapper dead. Equally strikingly, Bash's murder takes place off-camera, with the camera instead following Jatemme away from the scene as sits in front of a television set and turns up the volume to drown out the noise of the fatal beating.McQueen's previous films tackled hunger strikes, sex addiction and slavery; Widows isn't quite as weighty, but it still tackles social issues in amidst the action, including interracial marriage, and institutionalised racism when Marcus is shot by police after being pulled over. This serves as a reminder that McQueen is a director with intellectual goals and an interest in tackling important and controversial themes, although in truth there isn't enough time here to really develop them as he perhaps might have. Nevertheless, Widows proves that he can also make big budget Hollywood-style action movies with considerable style.",Widows
133,shawneofthedead,"McQueen's films can be harrowing and alienating - this one is neither, but it's also strange to watch.",7,13 December 2018,"THE LOW-DOWN: Hailed as a classy crime thriller with a feminist twist, Widows sees Veronica Rawlings (Viola Davis) gathering her fellow widows to pull off a heist after their husbands die in a mission gone badly wrong. The film boasts a pretty impressive pedigree: it's directed by Steve McQueen (12 Years A Slave, Hunger) and co-written by McQueen and Gillian Flynn (who wrote Gone Girl - both the book and the film).THE GOOD: Widows has both style and substance, which don't always co-exist in crime thrillers. Apart from scenes and moments shot with delicate flair by McQueen, the film powerfully weaves heartbreaking real-world violence into the backstory of one of its lead characters. When Widows is good, it's very good - its myriad characters and plot lines hint at the very thin line that separates crime from politics, and not many movies can pull off equating victory with comeuppance.THE NOT-SO-GOOD: For all that is good about the film, Widows is weighed down by an identity crisis. Its tone is all over the place, meandering from heist thriller to soap opera, by way of a political drama. This slows the film's pace down considerably, when it should zip and zing. Lavishing so much time on the film's politicians and antagonists also means that some of the ostensible leads get short shrift. Michelle Rodriguez's Widow, in particular, is so slight that even a last-minute addition to the heist crew (played by Cynthia Erivo) fares better in terms of character development. And it's hard to shake the feeling that McQueen shot a bunch of great scenes that he couldn't bear to cut (pretty much any moment featuring Daniel Kaluuya's thug), even though they don't actually help move the story along very much.KNOCKOUT PERFORMANCES: In an insanely good cast, Davis, Kaluuya and Elizabeth Debicki are the standouts. Davis wrings strength and vulnerability out of an underwritten role. Kaluuya flips his everyman charm on a dime and is truly terrifying as a henchman from hell. Debicki is effortlessly charming as the best Widow of all: the one who discovers she's much more than the trophy wife she'd always believed herself to be.WATCH OUT FOR: The cannily cast husbands of the titular widows - some have so little screen time that they might well qualify as Easter eggs. Shoutout to Liam Neeson, who gamely sends up his geriaction hero status while reminding viewers that he's actually a pretty good actor - even with contrived material.RECOMMENDED? Yes, but not without some qualifications. McQueen's films can be harrowing and alienating - this one is neither, but it's also strange to watch. There's a lot about it that's good, and quite a bit of it that doesn't work. But it's an interesting mess that's worth a look.",Widows

However, Widows begins promisingly but somehow feels dissatisfying by the time the credits roll with the plot twist we're introduced to part way through - which resurfaces during the conclusion & feels like a cliché & unnecessary subplot that distracts from the main fascinating premise it's supposed to be about. I totally understand why it was included - they wanted to give an A-list actor more screen time...

A great cast was totally wasted and it was a shame. You can tell Steve McQueen, the director, thinks he's a legend, but it's clear this guy just knows the right people who can hype him up to the public. Everything starts coming apart at the end of the movie and it is a total disaster. The lame attempt to insert modern political controversies is the film's undoing.

139,kaptenvideo-89875,What would you do if a loved one suddenly dies and leaves behind a debt that gets collected by criminals?,7,7 December 2018,"Steve McQueen was one of the old Hollywood's icon of cool, starring in a range of born classics from adventure to dramas.Now there's a black British director with the same name, offering different yet equally memorable work - long and slow but intelligent dramas about enduring extreme human conditions and dealing with it.McQueen's so methodical - or maybe bad at finding financing - that he only releases a new movie after every five years (so far).What extreme conditions? ""Hunger"" is about voluntary hunger strike and being ready to die for your causeman, ""Shame"" is about sex addiction, and ""12 Years a Slave"" about a freed slave caught and brought back to slavery. As the title suggests, ""Widows"" is about grief and how different people overcome it.The fourth feature project is somewhat of a departure for McQueen - not just a drama but an action movie of sorts, features a lot of characters, plus all of the central ones are women (played by Viola Davis, Michelle Rodriguez, Elizabeth Debicki, Cynthia Erivo, respectively).The story is about women with not much in common, except a dangerous debt left behind by their dead husbands' criminal activities, and one of the widows cooks up an elaborate plan to remedy the situation.Intelligent action drama for adult audience is something of an achievement in itself but ""Widows's"" most impressive achievement is definitely its grand scope.There are several storylines which sometimes interwine - including one depicting a contemporary American politcis -, with many different people demanding your time and attention.A comparision with quality TV series would not be out of place - which is a sign of quality these days - but somehow all this fits into about two hours. The 1983's miniseries it's based on ran nearly five hours, and the rough cut of the movie close to three.Just to give a sense of the proportions, I will name all behind the more important characters: Colin Farrell, Robert Duvall, Liam Neeson, Daniel Kaluuya, Jackie Weaver, Garret Dillahunt, Brian Tyree Henry, Molly Kunz, Carrie Coon, Lukas Haas, Kevin J. O'Connor, Jon Bernthal, Manuel Garcia-Rulfo, Michael Harney.The performances are real good all-around, so I won't bother going into details this time, especially because the movie is more story-oriented than interested in letting individual players be a star and stand out.Just gotta say it was especially unexpected but very nice surprise to see ""Get Out's"" softie lead man Kaluuya as a stone cold killer here.On the whole, McQueen has done a solid job putting all the content and players together. On the other hand, there's so much going on that the project's strong points tend to start working against themselves at times.For example, the markedly slow tempo works well for immersing the viewer in the setting and lives of the characters, giving everybody and everything important (including dialogue) necessary room to ""breathe"" and evolve naturally.Then again, sometimes it gets so slow that one might lose track of the main mission (dealing with the dead men's legacy) and the movie seems to grind to a halt and go nowhere for a while. Or one might forget some detail that comes suddenly up later.And despite the care taken by McQueen, some of the more interesting supporting figures - played by Neeson, Bernthal, Dillahunt - deserve more screen time than they get. Or at least better-written scenes that they get to appear in.""Widows"" is not for one in search for quick thrills. But it's always cool to get some quality TV in cinema format, so the mainstream movies can be more adult-orientated too.It may not be a born classic that you remember clearly a few days after (I do not) but it's mostly good while it lasts.",Widows
140,williampsamuel,A Masterful New Twist on a Classic Genre,10,29 November 2018,"To say that Widows is not your typical heist movie would be a significant understatement. It's darker, grittier, and much more serious than any of the Ocean's movies. The twists are bigger and far more surprising than the usual standby of the double-crossing crew member. Instead of the usual flashy, exotic locals the action takes place in some of the poorest, most crime ridden parts of Chicago. And with all due respect to Ocean's 8, it is unique in being the first heist/revenge thriller to feature all female leads.And what excellent leads it has. Viola Davis is just perfect. Driven, tough as nails, and yet deeply vulnerable in unguarded moments, her presence is the rock that anchors the entire film. Her character may frequently be in over her head, with barely more idea of what she's doing then the other women she forcibly recruited, but never for a moment does that stop her. And despite her personal doubts, she never lets the facade crack in front of the girls. She's living proof that hell hath no fury like a woman.Michelle Rodriguez is feisty and hard edged as always, but on some level it feels like she could do this role in her sleep. More interesting is Elizabeth Debicki. As previously pampered housewife Alice, she's the most sheltered, inexperienced, oft bewildered, and seemingly weakest of the group. But she is nothing if not resourceful, putting her seeming helplessness and good looks to good use, even when it means putting herself in deeply compromising and uncomfortable situations.And Brian Tyree Henry makes an excellent villain. As gangster/aspiring politician Jamal Marshall, he's calculating, seemingly cultured, but deeply menacing, with an explosive temper simmering just under the surface. In one of the movie's most absurd yet deeply suspenseful scenes he forces a couple of his lackeys to perform the rap they were practicing when they should have been guarding his stash. You know he's going to kill them, but it's still shocking when it happens. And for what it's worth their rapping is pretty good.Colin Farrell, Robert Duval, and Liam Neeson round out a very talented cast as a dubious local politician, his ailing, angry father, and Davis's late husband, who makes a strong impression in the frequent flashbacks.This a very well-crafted movie. The pacing is solid, and the photography likewise excellent, especially the night scenes. For a movie where so much happens in the dark of night, it's rarely difficult to tell what's happening. The only times anything is obscured it's because it's supposed to be. More important is the story. The standard scenes of the crew's recruitment, the painstaking preparations, and the heist itself all well executed, often with slightly different takes on the usual formula. And oh do the twists ever hit hard. It's not just that they're unexpected. It's that they turn the entire story on its head and pack an emotional gut punch to boot.And there is so much atmosphere to this movie. As I mentioned before, it's dark and gritty, though thankfully not to Zac Snyder levels. And it is deeply imbued with the local flavor of Chicago, in the most depressing ways possible. Poverty and crime abound. The police shoot first and never get around to asking questions. Every politician is lying and deeply corrupt, in ways that would be shocking almost anywhere else. Even the clergy are jaded operators. Indeed, the pervasive corruption is one of the most consistent themes in this movie, and the focus of several major plot points. I'd criticize it for being too cynical if I didn't know how true it was.What I do find a tad cynical is the portrayal of the men in this movie. The ones who aren't violent gangsters or fantastically corrupt are racists, opportunists, pervs, two-timers, or just cringy ""nice guys."" As we learn more about the central players it becomes apparent that even their relationships with their deceased husbands were far from perfect. There are some likeable guys, but they tend not to last long.Then again, not all of the women in their lives are supportive or entirely likable either, so maybe the point is that have nobody to depend on but themselves. And that is a point that's repeatedly stressed. They have no friends and family to fall back on. Neither society nor the people in power are going to help them. If they're going to survive and succeed, they have to do it on their own. It's an extremely obvious message of female empowerment, but somehow never a ham fisted one. And that may be the most amazing thing of all.",Widows

led by the outstanding Viola Davis, left without their husbands but with a collective £2 million debt. Little choice but to carry on the planned heist of their deceased spouses. A more mainstream and potentially accessible offering from Steve McQueen but still with his trademark touches - a long take of Davis grieving for her husband (a cameo by Liam Neeson) put me particularly in mind of Carey Mulligan's beatiful song in Shame. However, for whatever reason - perhaps the heist thriller genre of the film - I didn't connect emotionally with the characters as I did in Hunger, Shame and 12 years a slave and found myself switching off from time to time. Will be worth seeing it again as I'm sure I will have missed some of the film's nuances. But on first watch a really well made and acted 7 out of ten.",Widows
143,darkreignn,Intense and constantly interesting,7,22 November 2018,"""Widows,"" for better or for worse, is my first Steve McQueen film, and while I can't imagine it is his best, I can't say I'm disappointed. From the get go, ""Widows"" is intense. It starts with one of the most white-knuckle opening sequences, filmed beautifully by Mr. McQueen; the camera was almost a character in and of itself, and I couldn't take my eyes off of the screen. ""Wow,"" I thought to myself, ""If we get this same level of intensity throughout the entire film, it'll be one of the best of 2018!"" We don't get the same level of intensity as we do from the opening sequence at any other point in ""Widows,"" and it's not one of the best movies of the year, but it is definitely one of the better ones.Featuring a powerhouse cast including Viola Davis, Collin Farrell, Elizabeth Debicki (Elizabeth, I am single so idk maybe give me a call sometime), Robert Duvall, the underrated Michelle Rodriguez, and probably a few other people I'm missing, one thing you can't say about ""Widows"" is that the acting is bad. From beginning to end, everyone acts their asses off, and I pray you also enjoy the acting in this film because if not you're going to have an awful time. This is a very acting heavy movie, and by that I mean almost every scene consists of people talking to each other without much else happening. In fact, minus the first heist, the last heist, and some intermittent spurts of quick violence, the majority of this movie is people talking to each other - it almost feels like a stage play, in that respect.Now, this isn't at all to say that the film is boring, because it's not. Even though there are only two real set-pieces, if you can even call them that, I was constantly engaged in the goings on of the story. It was interesting to see the lives of these ladies, of the gang members, of the politicians, and how all of them intersected in one way or the other. There was an appropriate amount of tension in seeing how the heist was going to be pulled off, but the film is less about that and more about the lives of all of these people; ""Widows"" is not a heist film, but a drama about grief, racial tension, domestic violence, and abuse, that just so happens to have a heist in it.But when the heist does happen it is, while short-lived, exciting. And it should be, since the movie is over 2 hours long and the heist takes up maybe 10 minutes of those two hours. And depending on how you feel about that will ultimately decide your opinion of ""Widows."" If you want to see a high-octane, thrilling heist film, you'll certainly get it, but only during the first, and last, ten minutes of the movie. But if you go in knowing that you're getting a slow burn, impressively acted drama that focuses more on the people behind the heist than on the actual heist itself, I think you'll enjoy it.",Widows
144,austin0731,Not the advertised heist thriller,6,20 November 2018,"Widows is an interesting heist film that focuses not so much on the heist itself but the drama and motivation behind the individual characters. The film focuses a lot more on the individual character arcs of each character rather than focusing on the action and intensity of the heist. This movie had a lot of bottled up angst and in many ways is embodied by the internal and external performances of the three leads, Viola Davis, Michelle Rodriguez and Elizabeth Debicki. They had very good showings in this film and it really subverts your expectation when the trailers suggest a much more intense and heist centric film.In my opinion, the film does drag a bit and the 'twist' doesn't really seem all to original or unexpected.

148,Gresh854,An Unexpected Take On The Heist Genre,6,13 October 2018,"Not only do I adore Gillian Flynn's calligraphy, but I've also heard marvelous word about Steve McQueen as a director, so you could assume I was pretty stoked to attend an early screening of Widows. Let's just get this out of the way before I get into anything else: McQueen's directing in Widows is flippin' jaw-dropping. Some serious ""grade-A"" directorial mastery right here. McQueen's determination in choosing what not to show and what to show in the frame parades his exclusive trait. His directing here is immensely variant; there's a mass of different methods he uses to entice the viewers into this dark universe he has promulgated. The screenwriting, in terms of dialogue, is superb. Just to clarify, the writing isn't good necessarily in how the story plays out, more so how Flynn chooses to have characters interact. So, dialogue basically. It's all genius, truly. It's, however, troublesome to describe why I found the conversational moments so profound. The best way, I can say, to understand what I'm talking about, is to simply go witness the film for yourself. Quick statement, but Flynn is just continuously proving herself to being one of the best writers of this century. Can't wait to see what she writes next. PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE WRITE A FOURTH FULL-LENGTH NOVEL. So, evidently, combining McQueen's unparalleled directing style with such profoundly intriguing dialogue, resulted in a product that features some of the best colloquial/action sequences of 2018. That aside, it's discouraging for me to admit that I had some major issues with Widows despite my overall enjoyment of the film. First and foremost, this movie is sluggishly slow at times. There's so much extra baggage that is conferred in this movie's over 2-hour runtime that could've easily been cut out and still not had any affect on the critical elements of the overarching story. Have the guts to cut, as they say. Also, there are a ton too many characters and situations that this film attempts to juggle. The movie is constantly tackling way too many scenarios and themes that are based off of numerous amounts of different characters that it becomes immensely hard to focus on one particular plotpoint, except, obviously the main storyline. The principal problem with this issue is that it constitutes the audience into a stressful placement of being burdened with keeping track of the heavy abundance of numerous storylines. So, for example, after a while of exposition from one storyline, we'll finally jump back to another particular storyline that was previous to this one, but then, once more, hop onto another storyline creating this cycle of forced reajustment of the situations. This could be further proof that expanding this movie to a TV mini-series runtime-which was originally going to be the plan-would've resulted in benefiting with declining this issue.I'm not quite sure also, where Widows's was trying to go a great majority of the time. It sometimes just kept on dragging (at least, dragging with style). It's a tad disappointing how poorly the story was executed, especially when you know it was devised from such a talent like Flynn. There is some merit to the story from time to time; we get those groovy, unexpected Flynn twists and turns that level the movie's likability by a great extent. So it's not completely demented, it's just constantly on and off. So did I appreciate the artistry of Widows throughout its entirety? Oh, most certainly, yes. And did I enjoy a solid chunk of the film's runtime? Yeah, sure. And is there some dignity to the film's conclusion? Absolutely. The last 10 minutes of this feature-length granted us with the ultimate mega-sonic pay-off. Besides having these whimsical pleasures for the movie, I still can't quite figure out what the filmmakers where trying to accomplish. Are they simply trying to develop a compelling drama? Or, are they just trying to pull off a unique take on the heist genre? Or, are the filmmakers, factually, just trying to make a political point on crime and race? The pretentiousness and mighty confusion of why this movie exists in the first place may be troubling to some-some, which includes myself-but it also marks the unexpected richness that makes Widows stand out, for reasons that may insinuate a right or wrong perspective from cinephiles. (Verdict: B-)",Widows

150,Bertaut,"Looks amazing, but tries to cover too many issues, and the plot is laughable",6,26 November 2018,"Arguably the most ambitious heist movie since Heat (1995), just as did Michael Mann's genre (re)defining epic, Widows has aspirations far beyond the limits of its generic template. Written by Steve McQueen and Gillian Flynn, and directed by McQueen, the film is based on the 12-episode ITV series, Widows (1983), written by Lynda La Plante. McQueen's first two films, Hunger (2008) and Shame (2011), were two of the finest films of 2008 and 2011, respectively, but I didn't like his third, 12 Years a Slave (2013), and likewise, Widows has left me distinctly underwhelmed. Operating firmly within a genre framework, the film essentially tries to filter the basic heist template through a feminist pseudo-MeToo prism, taking in such side-issues as political corruption, police homicide, Black Lives Matter, institutional racism, American gun culture, hegemonic masculinity, and the importance of wealth. McQueen approaches genre much like Michael Mann, as opposed to, say, Quentin Tarantino, using the generic template as a launch-pad to examine various socio-political issues, as opposed to using it as a destination in and of itself. The problem, however, is that he tries to pack far too much into too short a space of time. Whilst I can certainly appreciate and celebrate how progressive the narrative is, placing a black woman at the centre of a genre traditionally dominated by white men, the film still needs to work as a genre piece, or no amount of moralising, didacticism, polemics, or political grandstanding can save it. And this is where Widows fails most egregiously - the core genre elements are as far-fetched and ridiculous as anything you're likely to see out of mainstream Hollywood, which serves to undermine and dilute the serious topicality for which McQueen is obviously striving.Telling the story of a team of women (Veronica (Viola Davis), Linda (Michelle Rodriguez, Alice (Elizabeth Debicki) , and Belle (Cynthia Erivo)) who attempt to pull off a heist originally planned by their now deceased husbands, set against the backdrop of an election for the alderman of Chicago's 18th Ward, contested by Jack Mulligan (Colin Farrell) and Jamal Manning (Brian Tyree Henry), Widows is pure pulp.McQueen's first genre film, he approaches it with the same seriousness with which he approached political protest, sexual addiction, and slavery. Obviously not interested in making a generic crime thriller, he and Flynn use the material as a vehicle for a racially-tinted critique of both powerful men (who are mainly, but not exclusively, white) and the corrupt systems that enable them. By creating a canvas depicting life at various social strata in Chicago - from the inherited white privilege of Jack to the materialistic social trappings so important to Veronica, from the poor black neighbourhoods of Jamal to the ""everything is a transaction"" philosophy of high-powered real-estate - the film attempts to address a plethora of racial, political, and gender issues.And herein lies one of the film's biggest problems. Rather than trying to deal with one or two core issues with something resembling thoroughness, it instead tries to deal with upwards of about seven, and ends up saying little of relevance about any. There's gender, economics, politics, racism, police corruption, prostitution, gun culture, materialism, and because of this proliferation, several themes receive so little attention, you wonder why they're there at all. Gun culture, for example, is really only addressed when Alice is assigned the task of buying the team's weapons. Asking where she is supposed to go to get guns, she is told simply and unironically, ""this is America"", a wink-and-a-nod point which relies almost entirely on the audience's left-leaning political affiliations. Another example is racially-motivated police homicide. Several years prior to the film, Veronica and Harry's (Liam Neeson) teenage son, Marcus (Josiah Sheffie), was shot and killed by a white police officer at a routine traffic stop. And that's about it. Marcus does factor into the film's big twist (kind of), but the racial overtones of his killing are never brought up again, and it remains unclear what McQueen is trying to say with this underdeveloped subplot.Which is not to say, of course, that none of the film's themes are foregrounded. Gender, for example, is built into the plot, especially in relation to notions of subverting the patriarchal status quo ante. As they prepare the heist, Veronica tells the team that their greatest strength is the element of surprise, because ""no one thinks we have the b---s to pull this off"". Later, she reminds them they have ""to look and move like a team of men"". Whilst on the heist itself, they have to disguise their voices so no one realises they are women. Similarly front-and-centre is the theme of race relations, something introduced in the opening frames - an above-the-bed shot of Harry and Veronica engaged in some very heavy petting. Whilst promoting the film, Viola Davis has spoken a lot about how unusual it is to open a film with an interracial pseudo-sex scene, and she's right about that; interracial couples are still relatively rare on-screen, especially sexually active older couples.Another excellent shot that carries huge thematic importance, this time in relation to city-wide macroeconomics, can be seen when Jack and his assistant, Siobhan (Molly Kunz), travel from a poor black neighbourhood to the affluent white suburb in which his campaign headquarters is situated. Filmed in one of McQueen's patented single-takes, what's especially interesting here is that after Farrell and Kunz get into the car, we can hear them, but we can't see them - Sean Bobbitt's camera remains fixed on the bonnet, with only a portion of the windshield and one of the side-mirrors visible. Meanwhile, we see the city rapidly change in real-time in the background, taking only a couple of minutes to go from skid row to millionaire's row. McQueen's unusual camera placement forces the audience to acknowledge just how thin the line is, geographically speaking, between rich and poor. At the same time, of course, the ideological divide is massive.Of vital importance to this particular theme (the vast differences between the haves and have-nots) are the Mulligans. Robert Duvall plays former alderman Tom Mulligan as a closet racist (and sometimes he doesn't bother with the closet); an old-school politician who believes that whoever can grease the most palms and line the most pockets should become the most powerful. An angry vestige of a dying era, Tom resents the fact that a Mulligan must slum it to win black votes.A less signposted, but equally as important theme is the corruption, dishonesty, and mercenary-like behaviour endemic to all levels of society. Really, the only man who isn't corrupt in some way is Bash (Garret Dillahunt), Harry's loyal-to-a-fault working-stiff chauffeur, but even he (like Veronica and the rest of the widows) lives off the proceeds of crime. The system may be built on a foundation of toxic patriarchy (a very different thing to toxic masculinity), but the women are no angels in this milieu; no one is immune to the corrupting influence of socio-political norms.For me though, the whole thing was underwhelming and predictable, with a twist that's as ridiculous as they come, and a narrative that relies far too much on coincidence and movie-logic. The widows need to disguise their voices on the job? Good thing that Belle's daughter has a gizmo that does exactly that! A highly successful modern-day thief who writes everything down longhand? A team of people (irrespective of gender and race) who become experts in something as complex as pulling off a major heist in a matter of weeks? For all its real-world social and political concerns, I never once bought into the central premise, that these four women could actually pull this off, and that undermines everything else. Additionally, unlike the Baltimore of The Wire (2002) or the LA of Heat, McQueen's Chicago doesn't feel lived in; it feels like someone's idea of a city rather than an actual depiction of that city.Just because a film addresses certain themes doesn't mean it earns a free pass (""look, Hollywood cares about poor people; we better not criticise the ridiculous plot""), and from a narrative standpoint, Widows is pretty ludicrous. With the plot often feeling contorted to support the themes, rather than the themes arising from the plot, McQueen's didactic and polemic concerns seem to have overridden his abilities as a storyteller. More a vehicle for protestation than anything else, that it tries to cover so many topics makes the whole experience emotionless, as if the filmmakers were dispassionately working off a checklist of issues on which to touch, rather than allowing the plot to organically lead into those issues. Because the central heist narrative can't stand on its own, the very real criticisms that the film is so concerned with enunciating are flattened and neutered. The socio-political commentary, for the most part, is never really integrated into the narrative - so you end up with a film that feels like its preaching at you rather than talking to you. If it had embraced its genre a bit more, and eased back on the homiletics, it would have worked much better, not just as a genre exercise, but, perhaps more importantly, as political commentary. As it is, it's a very good-looking but unoriginal, and at times, downright dumb movie, that seems to always assume its intellectual superiority to the audience.",Widows

154,peeedeee-94281,How is this movie rated over 5???,2,28 November 2018,"As I was watching Widows, I couldn't believe this was a movie with an average of 4 out of 5 stars. It felt more like a crappy Larry Cohen film than a high quality, mainstream Hollywood film. Heist? What heist. They mention it here and there, but there is very little work done on developing the heist angle. They barely even get the details straight, everything is last minute, but then suddenly they become pros on the day-of?
The acting and dialogue was cringe-worthy. I was laughing during the scene between Colin Farrell and Robert Duvall in the office. I mean, the anger comes out of nowhere, then Colin says a few words, suddenly Duvall's character is falling apart. I mean, come on.
Also, when they're looking for a new driver (because we have to assume the other was killed, even though we never actually see it), there's a big argument about bringing a stranger in, that suddenly is reconciled within 1 minute. LOL.
Things happen in this movie that are so random they just feel contrived or leave one perplexed. For instance, Viola Davis' just randomly decides to bring her dog with her to someone's house, then makes herself at home by putting her dog down to run around the house? Then...plot twist! That was just so dumb.
What happened to the blonde chicks Mom? She was slapping her around at the beginning, then it was like she got fired from the movie, we never see her again. Same with the 'boyfriend', or did she even get any money after being left for dead at the hospital lol.
The worst filmed scene in the movie has to be when we're treated to a view of the outside of Colin Farrell's car as his character Mulligan and his assistant have their discussion. We watch the outside of the car for a good 3 minutes. And you clearly see the driver run a stop sign at one point. Yeah, that's realism, Steve McQueen style.
Sorry Steve, I didn't like 12 Years A Slave, and this movie was 3 steps down from that one. Stick to making TV movies.
I gave it one extra star above the lowest you can give because the dog was entertaining and is the only actor who should get nominated for an Oscar.",Widows
155,Jared_Andrews,Thrilling and thought-provoking,8,27 November 2018,"Steve McQueen, the Academy Award winning filmmaker behind '12 Years a Slave,' directed the hell out of this movie. Since 'Widows' is a heist flick, some may view this directing choice for McQueen as a step down from the power and pervasiveness of his most recent film. But that's not the case. With the way McQueen moves the camera and frames his shots, he displays a wizardry of creativity and a mastery of his craft. He shows us that no genre of film is taking step down if it's handled correctly.Within the opening moments of this elevated thriller, it's evident that we're witnessing something made by a true pro. Crucial plot points are unveiled via dialogue-free or dialogue-light scenes that allow the actors room to convey story in other ways. There's a couple lying together, clearly deeply in love. There's woman with a black eye swatting away the hand of a consoling husband. There's a man trying unconvincingly to assure his wife that he has their store's finances under control. These rich backstories and fully formed characters reveal themselves in abrupt scenes but somehow never feel rushed. These scenes tell us so much by saying so little.After introducing these soon-to-be widows and their soon-to-be late husbands, we watch a flashback of the violence and destruction that led to their deaths. The husbands were criminals, and they stole a lot of money from a lot of bad people. Now Jamal Manning (Brian Tyree Henry), who happens to be one of those bad people and who happens to be a running for political office, wants his money back. He and his enforcer brother (Daniel Kaluuya, perfectly chilling in a way that's not at all over-the-top) make it clear that the widows have only a few days to pay two million dollars, or they will suffer the same fate as their husbands.Veronica (Viola Davis), the widow of the criminal group's leader steps up as the leader of these blindsided woman and shares her husband's notebook, which contains the plans for a job that will land them five million dollars. Linda (Michelle Rodriguez) and Alice (Elizabeth Debicki) agree to join, but the fourth widow doesn't show up to the meeting for some unclear reason.It's Davis' show, and the film would struggle without her flawless performance. She's the glue or the straw or the foundation or something. She's essential-that much is certain. But she's far from the only standout. Kaluuya is stellar, as always, and Debicki as well as rising star Cynthia Erivo jump off the screen. McQueen certainly knows how to make actors pop. Credit him as well as each performer.In addition to the thrilling action and interpersonal drama, there is also a healthy dose of social commentary. It's delivered with just the right degree of subtlety. It's never too overt of condescending, but it's noticeable if you want to pay it attention.This movie has a lot going for it. Call it an elevated heist. Call dramatic thriller. Call it whatever you want. By any classification, this is a brilliant film and one that deserves plenty of consideration come award season.",Widows

157,scb_coldsteel,A complex heist film revolving around the perception of women in our society.,9,26 November 2018,"So I saw Windows at the theater. I was really looking forward to this movie as I've enjoyed everything the director Steve McQueen has done. Overall I really enjoyed the movie. He managed to take a traditional heist movie and make it a rich emotional morality tale about the roles of women in our society while also making some deep social commentary.The plot of the movie opens with a fairly by the books heist gone wrong. Of course the actual heist just serves as a plot device for the real meat of the film. The real story revolves around the widows who are left behind and their struggles trying to manage their lives after their loss. The women become thrust into a life they don't understand to salvage what is left of their families. The movie brings up the question how far would you push and fight just to survive. On top of that the film also follows a subplot regarding political corruption and the abuse of power.All around the film did a great job juggling a number of different ideas. The film shows the struggle and trauma of those left behind after a loss, but also shows the resilience and determination of women fighting for their lives. On top of that the film managed to make socially relevant observations about political corruption, racism, and sexism. It was a smartly written film that had me cheering for the heroines the entire time.Of course the film also still manages to maintain the traditional thrills of a heist film. There were a few well made suspense and action scenes peppered throughout the film. In a lot of ways the movie reminded me of Heat with its complex and multiple well-developed story arcs. It's rare to find a movie that blends so many genres together so well while also providing a few interesting twists.Acting wise the movie had an absolutely ensemble cast. The film is packed with strong female leads. Viola Davis was phenomenal as expected. She has a way of emoting that few can compete against. She managed to play both the mourning wife and the empowered badass with convincing zeal. Daniel Kaluuya also did a great job playing a menacing and captivating villain. There really just was not a bad performance in this movie.Of course Steve McQueen did an excellent job directing. He managed to craft a deep and complex movie while also incorporating a traditional heist action thriller. Few directors can manage to juggle genres in a coherent manner while also being all around entertaining. Steve McQueen really delivered in making a movie that has a wide appeal, but also one that still maintains a fresh take on an old genre.There are a few plot points that felt a bit forced however and a few scenes were very convenient. You do also have to suspend belief on a couple of points, but nothing that is world breaking. I enjoyed the complex story, but the overarching plot points may feel overwhelming for some who are looking for a more traditional movie.Widows is a sleeper hit that is not getting the credit it deserves. It has a near-perfect mix of a fresh relevant story, great acting, a captivating drama, and all around fantastic directing. A must watch for this year. A 8.75 out of 10.",Widows

To believe these ladies could actually pull this heist off with zero training and only a few weeks prep is so implausible. The twist seemed over very quickly and actually not that big a deal. It felt a bit too much ""metoo"". It just felt that if it had been a revamped 6 parter on tv it would have been so much better.

Plenty that are apparently very stupid and think it should be an action movie from... trailers I guess? A number annoyed the heist is not much of the movie but that's a good thing! It's not a heist movie, it's a drama about women escaping their abusive, criminally-funded lives by first doing a crime. I didn't know a thing about it so expected something more along the lines of I'm Your Woman which along with The Kitchen makes there a sort of new subgenre of the mob/crime movie, I guess.Of course, a number explicitly hate it for being too PC (or woke or whatever the insult du jour is) by thinking it's ""make a heist movie, but with girls"" though of course entirely aside from being a remake of an 80s show, it also is not at all that fSome really amazing film-making in every sense. I have no idea what people who think it's slow, muddled, or jumpy expect from their films, as i was entirely engaged, sometimes enthralled, and tracked every detail of the plot and plan (as much as was shared... which was plenty) with no issues.8 instead of 10 is because I -- SPOILER -- really, really, really did not like the Liam Neeson not being dead part. The only implausible part of the story, way to sketchily told, so aside from smacking too much of the movie supervillian who's always one step ahead, it didn't have the emotional punch of the rest of it.Take as a counter -- MORE SPOILERS -- how very very well it worked when Daniel Kaluuya shows up in the van, and how well done (esp editing, do NOT show us every detail of them talking, stealing a car, catching up!

163,ccorral419,Divorce your self from seeing this one,5,12 December 2018,"Following his 2013 Oscar Winning Best Picture ""12 Years a Slave,"" director Steve McQueen returns with a star studded action drama about a handful of Widows (Viola Davis, Michelle Rodriquez - ""Fast&Furious,"" and Elizabeth Debicki - ""The Great Gasby""), along with new recruit Cynthia Erivo (BadTimes at the El Royal"") who step into the robbery arena when faced with tough times. Featuring Liam Neeson, Robert Duvall and Colin Farrell, one would think ""Windows"" to be a home run. However, think again. Written by McQueen and Gillian Flynn (""Sharp Objects"" TV), the first 3/4's of the film moves along at boring pace, with so many slow paced environment shots it's easy to fall asleep in today's reclining theater chairs. Just before the action finally engages, McQueen/Flynn toss in racial profiling scene that has nothing to do with the storyline. When the action does happen, things move fast and intrigue abounds, yet the film ultimately ends with unanswered questions. Neeson, Duvall and Farrell are one dimensional characters, that do little for bringing realism to the storyline. Brian Tyree Henry (""Atlanta"" TV) and Daniel Kaluuya (""GETOUT"") are the neighborhood bad guys challenging the establishment, who themselves have little to do other than give stern faces. And, poor Molly Kunz (""Colony"" TV) is given little more than VO background time. The fault here rests in the hands of McQueen and Flynn's writing. Divorce your self from seeing this one.",Widows

Unlike a lot of the reviewers I enjoyed the twists and the final act probably even more than the first 90 minutes, but if you come expecting a great action film you are likely to be disappointed.
I did not come solely for the action. I enjoy art house cinema and mindless action films equally. This was a cerebral action film. I just found it a little slow, a little cliched and pretty run of the mill when you remove the shiny veneer of the A list talent involved..
Maybe my favorite takeaway from the film was discovering the incredibly sexy Elizabeth Debicki . One stunning tall drink of water.
Not a bad film at all. Still gets a thumbs up, but cannot think of one deserving Oscar nod and the hype had me call this ultimately disappointing. Wait for the small screen is my advice.",Widows
165,DimitrisPassas-TapTheLine,"Ambitious, but with a rather poor outcome.",6,1 February 2019,"''Widows'' is a movie that many viewers expected, partly due to its talented director Steve Mcqueen (''Shame''), but mainly because of the screenwriting team which consisted of two very popular female crime authors, Gillian Flynn (''Gone Girl'', ''Dark Places''), Lynda La Plante -known mainly because for the timeless ''Prime Suspect'' tv series, based on her novels- and the director of the movie himself. As a result I has high expectations concerning this film, thus, the disappointment I felt after watching it was all the greater.
The movie is no-doubt well-shot and the production quality standards are pretty high, as expected from a production of this caliber, but the major problem lied in the storyline and the plot itself, which is more baffling due to the reason I stated above. Even though the story has a solid premise which engages the viewer, the unfolding and evolution of the plot seems to be uneven and the movie in some parts look kind of disjointed. The result is that the viewer is struggling to keep track of what is happening, missing other movie aspects such as photography, performances etc. The finale is a huge let-down which adds to our frustration and sense of void that we feel after watching ''Widows''. Moreover the triad of the -female- protagonists at no time manage to identify with the viewer in order for him to care for the character(s)
On the plus side, the performances by the main characters are good with Viola Davis stealing the show. I would also note R. Duvall's and C. Farrel's as father and son, doing a great job and also having some stretches of truly good dialogue. Furthermore, Liam Neeson and Brian Tyree Henry hold secondary roles and do a decent job. The soundtrack is also one of the best I've heard in a Hollywood crime film the last years.

Still grieving, they soon discover how much their husbands owed and who is after them for it and thus a bold heist that was to be completed is planned once again.The film is spiked with strong performances. Viola Davis is a commanding presence as the wife of the thieves' ringleader, Liam Neeson. Her life in a sumptuous apartment is threatened when a menacing political figure (Brian Tyree Henry) from another part of the city comes to demand his money back. She is forced to locate the other widows of her husband's business partners and is stalked by the politician's sadistic henchman brother (Daniel Kaluuya in a lively performance). Michelle Rodriguez and Elizabeth Debicki both give strong supporting performances as the other wives. Colin Farrell is effective as a young Irish-American politician trying to build a political base in the less white part of Chicago; Robert Duvall gives a welcome turn as his elderly father on whose shoulders he still stands.A contemporary crime drama, this one delivers well-defined characters and a visceral pace that power the story. It's all woven together with polish and confidence by Steve McQueen's stellar direction. At certain key points, the audience erupted into applause. A film taking place in Chicago, this story touches on the occasional overlap between the political and criminal worlds.

172,bastille-852-731547,Well-Made Heist Thriller,7,18 November 2018,"Steve McQueen's Chicago-set heist/crime movie is an intriguing blend of popcorn thrills and social commentary on real-life inequalities and violence plaguing the Windy City. This film has a truly stunning ensemble cast, and most of the actors and actresses are very good here. Even though the ensemble is large, most of the characters are surprisingly well-developed--a rarity in films with this number of characters. Viola Davis is outstanding as the lead actress. Other standouts in the cast include Colin Farrell as the son to a crooked and openly racist machine politician (Robert Duvall,) and Daniel Kaluuya as a psychopathic criminal.The film's heist scenes are suspenseful and well-executed, although quite fleeting in duration. The same is true with the scenes regarding the actual planning of the heist. Audiences should know that the film is more of a political drama than the trailers are selling it as, which I didn't mind, but many casual audiences would mind. The film's simple, understated score enhances the tension and drama in the film. While the movie could have used a bit of (well-written) comic relief, the tone generally communicates McQueen's messages and artistic intentions. The film's attempts at social commentary hit rather than miss most of the time, but the few attempts at social commentary that don't leave much of a mark seem rather glaring within the context of the associated scenes as a whole. The use of juxtaposition as both a narrative and aesthetic device at certain points in the movie enhances the viewer's experience as well as his or her absorption of the story's messages.""Widows"" is a good film but not a great one, containing a few clear-cut flaws. With an ambitious tone rooted in urban and social issues and a number of plotlines, the film does bite off a bit more than it can chew. It is also irregularly paced, as most of the planning and execution of the heist occur in the film's final 30 minutes. Yet despite this, the film almost feels a bit too long. 15 minutes of the film's first act could have easily been trimmed without detriment to the viewer or the narrative. That said, this is a good heist movie that should satisfy viewers that know what they're in for when they walk in. 7/10",Widows
173,deastman_uk,Consider this a divorce,4,12 November 2018,"My partner was so upset by this film that she made me watch the original TV series from the 80s. Incidentally, it still stands up and makes a lot more sense.But the question must be asked, in this day and age, why convert something that was a TV series into a film? The story of wives taking on a bank heist feels kind of #metoo in a perverse way so I get that, but the motivation of too many of the major characters simply make no sense.Colin Farrell plays a snake politician who wants no part in the family business, but already seems to be getting far too involved out of choice. One of the wives has a relationship whose only purpose is to provide a MacGuffin - this would be embarrassing in a student film. There is a Star Wars moment between one wife and another guy where the audience just laughs at how clumsy it is - this might be deliberate but plays no useful part in a heist film. The portrayal of the black gangsters is slightly more nuanced, but the only bits thats stick are uses of violence. There is also one more unexplained major character as you get nearer the end.Viola Davis is very good, and McQueen clearly remembered her from Secrets and Lies, and most of the rest of the cast do their stuff well. Daniel Kaluuya is chilling. But Chicago itself makes less impact on the film. Some of the location choices were frankly puzzling.I think the director (Steve McQueen) has managed to string a set of scenes that he feels have real human emotion in them, but has manifestly failed to create a film. Let alone a heist film. A brief look back at the brilliant Heat reveals a director who gave himself to the genre and let the cast breathe life into the characters.

One of the women has in her possession a plan laid out by her late husband on a cash earner of the illegal type and they set about carrying it out to gain some money to pay their milk bill.The story coasts along nicely with the beginning being about the botched job of their husbands and then into recruitment, planning and execution Finale.overall a great film, great story, good Cast and great directing makes this a worth watch film.

This is bad for the film because of it, not engaging the audience enough, to care about the characters or the film its self. This is due to poor script writing and character development of the film.Which is a shame since you have some great cast actress and actor in this film but sadly this film plot twist and acting doesn't save this film from its boring slow pace storytelling, which sadly this is the worst film this year, not a film I would recommend rushing out to watch.",Widows

Because it takes its time setting up the characters, delving deep into their sorrow, especially Viola Davis' character, it sorta drags on and on for far too long. What was also sort of weird was the fact that they set up one political character, only for them to drop the character in the end, leading to no closure at all.There were some great twists that made sense, but the execution of one twist (literally), was poorly done. The character is supposedly old-school, taking notes of every single thing.

Widows has attracted some glowing reviews, but one can only assume they are from people so dazzled by McQueen's reputation that they just can't believe he could direct something this inept. Nevertheless, he's taken a heist story and buried they heist and all heist-related activity so deep within a narrative more concerned with race and political corruption that, despite what you might think from the trailer, this isn't even really a heist movie. In doing so, what was originally a six-hour mini series - with more than enough plot to make a gripping two-hour movie - becomes a slow, lumbering, often tedious ramble, only occasionally enlivened by bursts of action and violence. There's so much preamble and so many arduously introduced sub-plots here that the actual inciting incident for the story - you know, the heist - is damn nearly halfway into the running time. And what would normally be the fun parts of a heist movie - the planning, the training, the problem-solving - is so absent that the heist itself delivers no tension or suspense because we just don't know enough about the masterplan to care. Which results in us never really believing that these women could pull off such a crime. And that rather undermines the entire exercise. McQueen has essentially hijacked his own movie to make various social and political points, but sabotaged himself in the process. The original Widows mini-series certainly contained the raw ingredients for a great heist movie. But this ain't it.",Widows

If they went this direction they could have orchestrated a world where the widows could have been a bit more sympathetic. Which was needed. I feel the ending should have felt more like a triumph. Instead it felt almost like the characters had paid their debt for their own initial mistakes. And that feeling isn't too satisfying. It also doesn't work as poignant or symbolic the way it probably hoped it would. Because it didn't seem very believable.I give it 6 stars because it had some good stuff in there. The acting was fine. The story concept was good even if there were ways it probably could have been told better. Some of the exchanges were funny and there was a few moments from a cinematic perspective which were really neat. Particularly a scene where we follow someone running for office from a Champaign location to his car ride and the over to another location. All in the same shot. It isn't just a difficult thing to shoot.

However, this thing is a steaming pile of refuse.I left the theater at exactly the one hour, ten minute mark when I realized that I couldn't possibly care less about anything that I was watching. There were incongruous scenes about uninteresting characters who were involved with wholly uninteresting events. Even with bad movies, I'm usually hooked by something within the first twenty minutes. There was absolutely nothing in this film that caused me to be even slightly interested in its story, and the only time I felt real tension was when it seemed like a West Highland Terrier's life might have been in peril (I owned one years ago). In other cases, violence was inflicted against people who were just being introduced to me or who I barely had a chance to even know. I didn't care.Even the acting was shaky: if Colin Farrell used that voice in Chicago I'm sure most people would ask him where he was from; Michelle Rodriguez's facial expressions were often laughably excessive; even the great Viola Davis seemed out of place.As a film student, I saw thirty minute student films that were far better than this garbage.

With this film and the last one proves that McQueen is a fearless director, but a smart one as well, and so is this movie. This film allows the audience to figure out what's happening instead of it being spoon-fed to us. It works like a puzzle that you have to put together in your mind. Now understand that this isn't an action film, it's a heist film with some action, however heist doesn't mean action. With that said, the film has a great flow to it, making you feel the weight of the situation that the main character going through. Viola Davis give a powerful performance, and is my favorite from her in her career, even more than Fences. It was nice to see Kevin J. O'Conner (The Mummy 1999) in this for a short time, haven't seen that dude in a while. Debicki, and Rodriguez are great as supporting characters. Liam Neeson has a smaller role then I anticipated, same with Robert Duvall, but nice to see him too. It's a stellar cast, with some strong performances. Overall, it was an enjoyable experience and a film I had to turn my brain on with, I like that.

I was certain it would be a good film, dragged a friend into the theater opening night, but we were both deeply disappointed by how slow and how long the movie is, and by how predictable the story turned out to be. No spoilers, but there are certain things that happened in the film that probably are intended to stand-out as hallmarks of the film and the story. But We both saw it coming from 100 miles away - it was just so easy. Maybe I'm watching too many movies these days but I can't recommend this film. I love strong kick-ass women and the stories that come with them, and this film showcases the best personalities and some new faces, but the material doesn't seem to be up to their collective kick-ass capacities.

Ultimately, the movie falls flat - it's a hodgepodge of grade-B gangster movie cliches, melodramatic comic book situations, suspenseful bad guys vs. good guys moments, and tender family moments, all not quite held together by the most preposterously silly plot to come out of Hollywood in a long time. If the movie didn't take itself so seriously, it might have been a little more fun, and it would have been a little easier to suspend disbelief.

Seldom have we seen a woman express such suffering, indecision, and heartache throughout this film. Ms. Davis isn't acting; she's suffering. It's in her eyes, her mouth, her expressions and he entire body.
Throughout the film, it was impossible to our eyes off Mr. Davis.
Mr. McQueen tried to get a lot into this film: heist, mistreated women, double-dealing, treachery and star-crossed love. people like Robert Duvall and Colin Farrel and Liam Neeson add spice.

201,andrewmerritt-31652,"I liked the script, but where was the plot",8,14 November 2019,"Widows stars Viola Davis, Michelle Rodriguez, Colin Farrell, Liam Neeson, and Robert Duvall. After a heist goes wrong four women plan their own robbery so they can pay off their debt that their husbands left behind before they died. This movie is directed by Steve McQueen and is written by Steve McQueen as well. First thing I would like to address is that the movie is well acted with a fantastic script. Everyone involved in the making of Widows really put in the time and effort from the acting, script, and the music. The first twenty minutes of the movie is an intense ride, but after that everything slows down. Before the robbery takes place there are certain scenes where I was wondering if that was necessary and those certain scenes dragged on. However there are still some scenes where the movie adds some intensity to the mix. One person who stands out of the whole cast is Daniel Kaluuya. He was in Get Out and Black Panther, and in this one he plays a straight up murdering psychopath. Whenever he makes an appearance I could feel the intensity in the air as I had no idea what he was going to do because he's unpredictable and I felt like he was channeling his inner Joker. Second thing I would like to point out is that the cast is so long that it's hard to keep track of. The movie focuses on these four women we meet, but the rest of the cast is just confusing. We get to see a good forty minutes of Colin Farrell and then after that we see nothing and some of the cast I thought would play an important role, but they vanish and we never see them again. I had a hard time whether this was a heist movie or a political movie as half of it is political, but the other half we get into the heist so the balance between these two is very awkward, as the pieces don't quite fit together. Overall the acting, script, and the music I liked, as it build up the intensity. However the directing could've been better as they had an idea of how it should be directed, but the pieces didn't fit.",Widows

210,jimcheva,"Top-notch talent, often violent, taut until... it isn't",6,7 October 2018,"It would be hard NOT to recommend this film simply based on the top of the line actors here. Seeing Viola Davis and Liam Neeson as passionate lovers might be worth the whole film. Michelle Rodriguez for once doesn't play the Michelle Rodriguez character (someone else does); you might almost mistake her for America Ferrara initially. Duval plays in a familiar register but he does it well; Farrell is workmanlike but in an unfamiliar role. Etc.As for the story, it is wound tight for most of the film, including scenes of violence worthy of (and not always far from) Tarantino. There is also a theme - almost overdone these days - of women discovering themselves through transgression. And there are some very sexy scenes.Strangely though, the film goes seriously off-track at the end, almost as if the screenwriters ended up in a hurry or just didn't care anymore. Except for one applause-worthy moment, the ending feels cursory and leaves some pretty obvious questions unanswered. Which is downright strange for such an otherwise tightly written film. To put it another way, for much of the film it's 8 or 9 star, then in the close it's 3 or 4.I'm surprised honestly some of the high-powered talent here didn't demand some rewrites. As it is, you'll probably enjoy much of it (unless you can't stomach violence) and certainly if you're the kind of viewer who just lives for a few good moments between real pros, you've got them here.

In my opinion, they are discordant and do not serve the plot at all. This film tries to be like recent films where women are empowered against men who cheat and use them. It's also tapping into racial inequality even though it is not an all black cast.I just waited and waited for the heist and when it appeared it was muddled and sloppy.

It does have some nice little moments where it actually seems like it has the potential to be a good movie, moments where the director actually seems like he knows what he's doing. Unfortunately, those little moments are the only real promise that the film has. The acting is nothing special. I'd go as far to say that most of the acting is bad outside of Viola Davis who does well but not well enough to deserve an Oscar. It's just a heist movie with somewhat original background drama thrown in. It tries to so hard to be more than it is. It comments on race, women and morality poorly and does nothing to actually give the viewer anything that they don't already see on CNN.

227,mallaverack,Such a disappointment.....,4,18 February 2019,"....and the reasons why have been well expounded by many reviewers here.
I have awarded four stars because the overall acting was very good and there was some (very much under-done) tension in the telling of the story.
But gosh, the implausibilities and un-developed plot as well as the lack of thematic coherence, smack you in the face.
Scenarios which are set early in the movie and which appear of significance are simply swepy aside by the time of the movie's end. The close loving relationship between Harry and Veronica (the film's central character) is simply negated by the final violent twist played out in the widows' hiding place.
This climax is reached with barely an explanation and is one of the film's glaring inept plot lines. Another, which has rightly been highlighted by many critics here centres on Jamal Manning's demand for money from Veronica.
This plot line underpinned the very reason why the widows banded together. Yet, at movie's end there is absolutely no resolution let alone reference to this key plot component. Very amateurish indeed and pretty inexcusable from a director of McQueen's standing.
I was drawn to this film, not just by memories of the original La Plante storyline but by the array of accomplished actors involved. As stated the acting was just fine but the underuse of characters was obvious. Once Academy Award nominee Jackie Weaver appears for a few minutes and disappears after performing her quite superfluous role. Robert Duval may have set a record for the most number of expletives used in two or three risible sentences!A most disappointing film and if you are a fan, like me, of heist movies, ignore it completely.",Widows
228,jascoward,Success.,8,31 July 2019,I only watched this with the wife when it aired on HBO. I didn't expect much. I was blown away. I was really emotionally invested by the end.

229,rich-fouts,Great ride interleaves relevant social and criminal issues and motives,9,8 September 2019,"Steve McQueen brings an intriguing edge-of-your-seat thriller loosely based on Lynda LaPlante's novel of the same name. It's a tangled web but very realistic based upon corrupt money, big crime bosses, public elections, driving while black and police brutality. I appreciate the other reviewers who wanted the story to be simplified but I think the complex web of connections is what makes this film far more interesting and realistic given its plot and themes.Viola Davis once again demonstrates her superb acting chops as she masterminds a significant robbery that her dead husband was planning to conduct.She engages the questionable skills of three reluctant women who, but for their simultaneous status as widows would never even know each other ( brilliantly played by Michelle Rodriguez, Elizabeth Debicki, Cynthia Erivo). Jackie weaver delivers a terrific cameoDaniel Kaluuya, who just keeps getting better and better, fulfills the role of a nasty, often terrifying, brutal opponent. The wonderful Garrett Dillahunt is excellent as a somewhat innocent, but sympathetic bystander who pays a big price for protecting his employer (delivered with empathy but not overly sentimental; bravo Garrett).Small but important hints are revealed along the way that tie things together at the end. A touching epilogue delivers a final note of clarity.Hans Zimmer's score is perfect and almost plays a supporting role in itself. A delicious dramatic thriller fulfilled with first-rate actors and MCQueen's competent direction. Beautifully shot with most scenes at night across a full span of Chicago neighborhoods. I thoroughly enjoyed this film.",Widows

I haven't been beaten over the head with this many infantile messages since I watched Crash.
And, to add insult to injury, the writing is clunky and dull and the acting is proof that even the best thespians can't overcome a poor script.

237,MackMonMay87,Wi-D'oh! ...Or Maybe Wi-don't!,6,20 November 2018,"Widows was marketed as an all-female slam-bang action/heist thriller, with some top-notch actresses in the cast (seasoned and newcomer alike), rounded out by other capable Hollywood regulars.What you get is a 2 and half hour end product that feels like 3 and half, with completely meaningless plot twists and reveals, flashbacks within flashbacks (always such a welcome film device. We love needing a roadmap to keep track of where in the timeline of the story we are), and a seemingly endless parade of storylines, motivations, and subplots to keep track of. And is all of it worth it?I didn't realize until coming on IMDB that Widows was a BBC miniseries, and that makes a lot more sense considering the amount of material and content the movie tries shoving into its runtime. Steve McQueen needs to take a cue from a health-conscious butcher and realize that leaner is better, and if you need a ton of content to tell your story, either choose a different medium than film, or spread out the ideas over more than one film.There's moments of a good film in Widows. I won't go through the huge ensemble cast name by name, but it's filled with extremely talented performers who all have some legitimately good moments, but the focus of the storyline is so scattered and the rising action of the story so slow, with so little payoff, that it dulls a lot of what could have been some really stirring moments. In fact, the only reason I gave this title a 6 instead of an average-level 5 is because some of the movie's good scenes and the competent way (most of) the shots are set up earns it something.It's always ambitious when movies try to tackle serious, socially important subject matter, and some of the greatest films of all time do that, so of course there's a place for it. But the priority of a filmmaker should always be to first make something watchable, smooth, coherent, and entertaining. Widows has a mostly heavy-handed approach to it's themes, with some of the commentary being distracting and out-of-place at times. As well-intentioned as the underlying content of Widows is, that doesn't mean it's delivered in a high quality way, and doesn't make up for its shortcomings.At some points the drama and seriousness of Widows made me laugh (unintentionally), as well as how hard it attempts beating you over the head with who's right and who's wrong. But the highest prize of that order goes to Collin Farrell, who chews up the scenery with his sometimes-there attempt at..a Chicago accent? You can have fun spotting when he's trying it and when he's not, with the cream of the crop being when he barks: ""I waaant dat munney"" at another character. Solidly entertaining.There were good ideas and great people involved, but Widows needs to consider re-marrying a sense of brevity. 6 out of 10.",Widows
238,rcastl2335,A heist thriller with no thrills,3,24 November 2018,"Last night I was reading an interview with two outraged critics, questioning the sense of American filmgoers who weren't turning out for this movie. One of them described the film as ""poignant."" Not action-packed, not suspenseful, not funny, not clever. (The similar Ocean's 8 was all of these.) But poignant. Frankly, I don't think moviegoers go to a heist movie to grab their hankies in tears. The reason the audiences have been slim for Widows is it's muddled in its narrative, dreadfully slow and not terribly clever, with at least one subplot too many. Some of the performances stand out: Elizabeth Debicki is excellent as a woman torn between survival and salvaging her dignity. Broadway star Cynthia Erivo gives a fast, fun, riveting performance that is a complete flip from her excellent work in the otherwise execrable Bad Times at the El Royale. Viola Davis mourns dramatically. And Colin Farrell gives his best performance since the very early days of his career. But acting won't save a movie that drags its feet this badly. It's a shame, too. The idea had great promise.",Widows
239,GODZILLA_Alpha_Predator,Not your average heist thriller,9,20 September 2018,"Caught Widows at TIFF this month and I can tell after watching that this is going to be an Oscar favourite next year. After a group of criminals dye in a heist gone wrong, their widows, Veronica, Alice and Linda, are forced to collect the money to repay their husband's debt. From there the women have to find their individual strength to survive especially when most of the men in their world are either cut-throat criminals or corrupt politicians. And that is just the basics of Widows. This story has far more to tell when you look at it under the surface.Widows is thematically about how people move on and rebuild themselves in a broken society. The core group of women have had their lives be defined by their husbands' actions for better or for worse. From sexism, race relations, entitled privileges, politics to infidelity, director Steve McQueen is exploring so many of these subjects in his heist thriller. In less capable hands, so many of these themes and messages could feel force-fed and overbearing but McQueen makes them engaging in every single scene he shoots. Scenes will cut from calm, quiet moments to establish the nature of the widow's late marriages to sudden bursts of violence, action and tension to get your heart racing. Along with shots filled with dark and cool, light color palettes, McQueen shows on screen how divided the world is between those who feel they deserve wealth and power and those are mistreated by it. And through this divided perception, the women begin to take ownership of their lives and reassess what their marriages were really built on.While Widows is a thematically dark and serious story, Gone Girl author-turned-screenwriter Gillian Flynn gives the characters a lot of subtle humour and sharp witted dialogue that actually makes the film surprisingly fun to watch. And to its credit that Flynn, along with McQueen as the co-writer, gives so many of these characters, especially the star women, unique layers that makes no one feel like a blank slate.While it is an ensemble piece, Viola Davis is definitely the most awards-worthy to watch. As the lead widow Veronica, Davis brings so much to her character without even having to say a word. Davis displays this feeling that Veronica has to build a wall to block the emotional pain she is suppressing in order to keep the other widows in line for the upcoming heist. But once in moments when she is alone, you see Davis unleash that emotions very suddenly and then very quickly go back into being a commanding presence. Michelle Rodriguez gets a break from the usual action films to show dramatic range in her character Linda. While I wouldn't call it a break-out, it establishes that Rodriguez can play more then just the usual action heroine. Collin Farrell also does great bringing complexity to the corrupt politician Jack Mulligan who is seeking to escape his cruel father's legacy. But Widows is also filled with a lot of surprising stand-outs in terms of acting performances. Elizabeth Debicki does a lot with her character Alice that could have been one-note. Debicki shows Alice go on a transformation from a young, frail socially-dependant housewife to a character that is done being mistreated and seen as vulnerable. While Cynthia Erivo doesn't show up until late in the film, she makes a very strong impression once she joins the crew. And Brian Tyler Henry and Daniel Kaluuya bring a lot to their villain roles. Henry is calm, confident but also intimidating as the kingpin-turning-politician Jamal Manning, particularly in a scene with Davis. However it is Kaluuya as Jamal's brother Jatemme, who is just absolutely terrifying. With just a stare, Kaluuya'c character makes you feel small and scared knowing what horrible things he will do next. The one thing I will criticize is that I felt both Jon Bernthal and Carrie Coon were both underutilized in their roles.Widows has a lot going on in its two-hour runtime and there some plot twists that make it feel a little incoherent but does very little to impact the film's near perfect quality. Widows is a film that is one of the most thrilling of this year and still has a very compelling and ambitious story that McQueen and Flynn have put on screen.",Widows

This may surprised the fools in the PC armies but this film is based on a 1983 BBC miniseries, and that had women cast in lead roles. Plus the film is reminiscent of Set It Off, which had an all BLACK FEMALE CAST, and a BLACK director and a BLACK writer. That movie was made in 1996! Can you believe it? the 90's was woke too, but the press (despite their insistence on being so much more enlightened than the rest of us) doesn't know about films from a mere 22 years ago, or is deliberately ignoring film history to push through political points.

242,lukas-ingel,"Stylish, bleak, HEIST",10,29 March 2020,"I've watched this movie twice now, and liked it even better upon my second viewing whereas in my first, I was filled with so many impressions I would've probably given it an eight outta ten.
The movie does touch upon many different themes, but having a more clear view now I think it only makes sense for it considering the characters and the circumstances within the movie, and at the end it's all wrapped up very nicely without saying too much. Which drives me to what I really like about the movie...
It's real. It doesn't tell you everything. It's all the little things you see and hear about every day but don't pay enough attention to, it takes you behind the curtains of several political scenes with the pros/cons of each and it's bleak, it's gritty, and you get to see snapshots of so many different lives and how they are all entangled in this web, all with complex dynamics. You have no idea what's coming 10 feet ahead but it's probably not good, so be prepared.
The movie is kind of a slow-burn but at the same time very intense. A lot of that has to do with intimidating characters in every corner, and you're just waiting for them to collide and see what the outcome will be.
When it comes to the heist itself - no spoilers - this is without a doubt the most real depiction I've witnessed. It's not perfectly detailed, planned, realized because it really can't be. Suddenly you're just in it with what you've got, you can sense the dread that it can so easily go wrong but all that matters is moving forward - exactly how I could imagine it would be like to pull one off in real life. It's not over-the-top action and glamourous settings, it's not full of one-liners, and you don't see them carry everything easily. The duration of it all feels like it is a lot less than it actually is (about 15 minutes non-stop) because you're practically in it yourself, experiencing it just as they are. I'm very impressed with how it was carried out, great directing.To me, Widows more than lived up to its premise, and I know for sure I'll have more viewings to come and love absorbing all the different themes and layers that it portrays with a bleak and honest style.",Widows

Make it seem more action packed than it is. That being said, that doesn't Mean it's not a good movie. There's a moment in the film where it turns from 'meh' to 'HOLY CRAP'. Normally I would atribuye this to a classic Gillian Flynn twist, but my understanding is it's talen straight from the tv show. Whatever it's from, it's brilliant. It makes you completely switch your allegiances anf sympathies. Other than that, the other thing I really have to say is this film is why you shouldn't underestimate women. We're compared to Cats for a reason. We will figure you out. This movie has such a great cast, it was hard to go wrong.

There was a modicum of suspense, that mostly took place in the second half of the film. The beginning was slow moving and saved mostly by the great actors Viola Davis, Liam Neeson, Colin Farrell and Robert Duvall, and Viola Davis' character's dog. As I was watching it I couldn't escape the feeling that this film must have been written a couple of decades ago because its message of female empowerment doesn't jibe with the status of women today. What do you know, when I looked up the credits I found it was based on a tv show from 1983. That explained a lot. Women who don't know what their husbands do for a living? A mother telling her 30 year old daughter that men provide for you? It was blatantly anachronistic. I don't understand why Steve McQueen couldn't have found a better idea.

249,popcolin,Annoying and Unrealistic,2,4 October 2019,"Nearly everything about this movie has the ability to make you want to turn it off. From the the way everyone treats eachother (damn these people have got to work out their issues) to how fluid the problems seems to escalate and resolve themselves: it is all annoying. I'm not sure why Viola Davis' character has to be so relentlessly rude and stuck up; why all the trouble that the main characters get into can just be easily flirted around; the odd and unnecessary violent scenes involving wanna be ""badass"" character portrayed by Daniel Kaluuya; why there are so many scenes with Colin Farrell when he doesn't seem to matter in the main plot; why all the struggles of the three leads demand so much screen time (and the stupid romantic prostitution scenes with Elizabeth Debicki I'm not sure what that is all about but definitely unappreciated) . There are just a lot of misses here, especially with the structure of micro-scene after micro-scene which don't really connect the way Steve McQueen tends to think they do. Scenes come and go with little to no consequence for the rest of the storyline (like the babysitter running for the bus. Honestly, what?!). I'm not really sure who we are suppose to root for, the guy trying to get his money back or the women trying to steal someone else's stuff. Either way it doesn't work, and it also doesn't make sense that there are 4 widows and we don't see the 4th one until the unnecessary plot twist. I won't spoil that for you but when the plot twist does happen you will feel mistreated and demand to the television screen your stupid money back for this sorry excuse of an...action movie?? I guess. Not much of an action movie more like a social-statement character-study where the motivations of nearly everyone doesn't make much sense but hey I guess it proves to drive the ""story"" forward. Also an awful use of flashbacks to the point where it doesn't seem justified what they are showing. In summary, probably only watch if you are low on your daily dose of seeing jerks mistreat eachother, like seriously these attitudes are what is wrong with the world so seeing it glorified in this form just to show some kind of empowerment just doesn't work.

There are a number of unexpected transpirations and revelations that add depth to the plot and leave me wondering how common they are.As for the acting, I'm just going to point out how great Daniel Kaluuya was in his portrayal of a memorable character.Overall, and far beyond its premise, Widows is a socially and politically risky movie that can lead to some interesting conversations if you're willing to look beneath the surface.",Widows

Saying that, I didn't watch this for Steve McQueen or Gillian Flynn, I watched it for Viola Davis and I was pleased.The individual storylines don't create a convoluted mess, instead, they depict wonderful stories and create a more vivid and descriptive picture. The elements of surprise are definitely there, and it's packed with crime too. It's not that much of a light Friday watch but something you can set aside time for.

An exciting premise which is completely wasted. 'Widows' calls itself a ""Heist"" movie but the actual heist was so disappointing. There is no tension, no suspense, no unpredictability what so ever.

258,neobateman,Great heist caper almost on the level of Heat.,8,1 December 2018,"After Shame and 12 Years A Slave, Steve McQueen returns to the directors chair, with an ensemble casts he crafts a suspenseful, dramatic and well acted thriller. A group of thieves headed by Harry Rawlings (Liam Neeson) is killed during their latest heist. This leaves corrupt politician Jamal Manning with 2 million dollars lost. Him and his brother Jatemme (Daniel Kaluuya) threaten the widows of the crew (Viola Davis, Michelle Rodriguez, Elizabeth Debicki) to pay back the 2 million dollars. Now the widows must team up to finish Harry's final plan which will earn them 5 million. Alone the cast of the film had me interested. Viola Davis is one of the strongest actresses working today, Colin Farrell has widely proven himself to be more than just a pretty boy and I was extremely excited to see him in a Steve McQueen production. Robert Duvall, an acting legend. Liam Neeson especially I was thrilled to see in a non Action-Blockbuster. It has been a long time since Neeson has really been able to shine in a Drama but even with limited screen time he truly leaves a impression. I was a little worried about Elizabeth Debicki and Michelle Rodriguez, I have never seen Debicki in an extended role. Rodriguez certainly isn't a newcomer but the Fast and Furious movies aren't necessarily examples for great performances. However I am delighted to say that both have truly surprised me, both have such vulnerability to them. They aren't action heroes, they aren't thieves, this was the job of their husbands. So now they are forced to do this, often struggling with the weight of becoming a criminal. This is female empowerment at its best. Often we see women commit violent acts in movies or are forced to become criminal, the implications of this are never addressed. I found it very refreshing that they never make a big deal out of the fact that they are women. They are people and forced to deal with a situation too big to handle, where relying on each other is the most important aspect. Davis commands the screen with strength and commitment, but when the moment calls for it, she is crushed under the pressure. As stated before Davis is easily one of the strongest actresses working today and here she proves it yet again. Other actors like Colin Farrell, Robert Duvall, Carrie Coon or Jon Bernthal pop in and out of the screen. But they leave little impressions, they all give good performances but their characters simply weren't developed as well as the main leads. They were more or less plot devices that had to be there for the story to work. Cold lighting makes the urban setting of Chicago feel very gritty and realistic. This is a sad world the film presents where no escape can exist. The mission doesn't even feel like a cry for escape but rather a mission that needs to be completed. There are many smart edits too that keep the tension flowing and the action exciting. The film has a few slow parts and dragged in a few places. Overall however I can absolutely recommend Widows. An extremely well crafted and exciting thrill ride.",Widows

I do believe I have found a NEW candidate for the worst movie EVER made.For sure - I will be SCARRED from Liam's presence in ANY movie going forward.WHO in their RIGHT MIND OVER put this screen play to pen?What were they thinking? Let's emotionally manipulate people ? WASTE THEIR TIME?And then there was that DAMNED DOGWTH - I mean WTHHow DUMB ARE THESE PEOPLE ?SO many holes in this plot AND movie - I can never watch any of these actors AGAIN - EVERThis movie wasn't JUST BAD - this movie should COVER GROUP THERAPY costs for VICTIMS AND SURVIVORS who actually watched the entire movie just to see where it goes - or DOESN'T GO.SHAME on ANYONE who had ANYTHING to do with EVER bringing this movie to the cutting room floor.I wish I could accept a linear time model JUST SO time travel WOULD be possible so we could go BACK and just prevent this movie from EVER being made.Of course it's not as bad as Netflix's The Punisher - especially season 2. :),Widows
260,jdgan,One of the most overlooked movies of recent memory.,10,10 February 2021,"Widows is a film that is honestly overlooked a lot when it comes to gritty heist films. From what I've heard, the film received little to no attention from awards ceremonies despite critical acclaim. After hearing a lot of flak against it, I finally decided to watch it. And I do not regret it at all.From both a technical and storytelling perspective, this excels and balances out all of its elements to create a gripping narrative. After 12 Years a Slave, Steve McQueen proves once again that he is an amazing director by not only providing depth and layers to a well paced action film, but manages to tread the line between a mainstream crime flick and a deep story that follows these amazing characters as they all fight to get out of this desperate situation. That way, he manages to make it accessible enough to a bigger audience and still manages to insert powerful themes in an incredibly subtle way.The performances that are on display here also deserves praise. All of them were amazing as they had layers and depth that not only made them real but also sympathetic. The standouts were: Viola Davis, Elizabeth Debecki, Colin Farrell, Liam Neeson, Brian Tyree Henry, Daniel Kaluuya and even Michelle Rodriguez.The cinematography is also pretty amazing as we get some long takes that grip us into the scene and even drags out the tension in an amazing way.Hans Zimmer also deserves praise for an overlooked and minimalist score that matches and enhances the mood of each scene.In the end, I finished the movie incredibly satisfied with the end product. If you go in and expect a slow burn with amazing characters and great themes, then you'll downright love this film. 10/10.",Widows
261,horizonbts-206-628336,Proper Way to tell a Story!,9,17 February 2019,"I bought the movie when it came out on dvd, as I wanted to see it in the movie theatres! I read some of the previous reviews, and all I can say, some of todays action movies have completely spoiled us. So many that reviewed just couldn't wait for the story to unfold. Slow in the beginning perhaps, but too many of us get spoiled with today's types of movie. Which I admit too I enjoy, but what I really enjoy is a good movie like a good book, unfolding the way it should bit by bit. This movie gave us some really nice turns and twists, and yes it took some time to unfold and develop, but I like my mind to do some thinking along the way, just like a good puzzle it will all came together. Just like the day of the iphones and social media we don't want to have to think for ourselves. Call me old fashioned if you want, but just like shaking a present handed to me gift wrapped, I like to guess about the contents, instead of handed to me totally unwrapped-now that's no fun. This one will keep you guessing and wondering all the way to the end, and thats just the way I like it. Plenty of action if you can be patient, just like your Birthday and getting that present it takes a while to unwrap, but the surprise inside is worth the wait!!",Widows

Quick thoughts:Not a slam dunk for me, I liked McQueen's last two dramas better, especially Shame which is probably in my top 10 for the decade.Still, belongs to the richer half of thrillers thanks to themes surrounding the main plot.A well made heist scene.A darker Ocean's Eight (terrible comparison, I know)Ending feels rushed, wasn't really rewarding, but I liked the last line.Thematic similarities to Gone Girl, not nearly as good as a film though.Is all around steady, but I felt it never found a higher gear.Cynthia Erivo would beat me in arm wrestling.I'm officially in love with Elizabeth DebickiExpectations I had for the film maybe took away half a star (out of five)Rating: 6/10",Widows

But nothing worked... The pacing was off, the sub-plots, it just didn't have any real intensity to it, especially when needed. The worst part was when you finally get to the third act you are let down again, immensely... I think I actually said out aloud at this point while watching ""are you serious, is that it...?!""

266,TheJohnnyPHreak,An Excellent Dramatic Heist Movie,8,8 January 2019,"It was the cast the drew me to Windows. Not that it was an action drama. Not that it was directed by Steve McQueen (12 Years A Slave). But this hugely talented cast in a heist type film was almost all I need to get me on board to see this. The trailer did help a bit. The flashes of action were intriguing. I thought to myself there is no way you could have a cast like this in a heist drama and it underperform. Steven McQueen directing from a script he wrote with Gillian Flynn (Gone Girl) lives up to the cast that on screen.Widows is heist drama that's not really about the heist. That's what makes some of these films so great. There is a huge event that is supposed to happen but the film focus on the characters. McQueen knows who he has on screen and he lets them run. The film follows three windows, Viola Davis, Elizabeth Debicki, and Michelle Rodriguez (there are four but that's a bit of a spoiler) whose only connection is their husbands were all criminals who died during a heist. The owner that money was a politician (Brian Tyree Henry), who was going to use the money to battle an incumbent (Colin Farrell) for the spot of alderman. He is demanding that money back and the windows have mere days before he comes calling to all of them.That's as deep as I want to go into the plot. Because this film has a lot of political intrigues, a bunch of tense moments and a few large plot twists. To spoil them would do a disservice to extremely well acted dramatic action film. The performances from everyone on screen are what kept me sucked into this film. I wanted to see where it goes because it takes turns I didn't expect. Everyone is so strong on screen, even a few people that have minor roles. I think every important character gets an excellent character moment. Davis, this is her show first and foremost. We know what she's an Oscar winner. Hopefully, she'll be a multiple Oscar winner. She is the lead of the film. She's strong, tough, with a very vulnerable side. When they say tour de force, this is the kind of performance they mean.With a cast that includes who I've already mentioned plus Robert Duvall, Daniel Kaluuya, Jacki Weaver and Cynthia Erivo, it's hard to pinpoint another standout because everyone is so good in the film. I will say Debicki is right behind Davis. She uses her woman side to get what she wants in a few scenes and it's empowering. From opening to end, I believe that she gets the best character evolution. This is the best I've seen Rodriguez in a while. People give her more weighty roles. She can act. Kaluuya is building up such a diverse resume. Here he's definitely a villain, a terrifying one. He's not quick to kill and not quick so savor. I think his character enjoys being menacing. It comes out in spades. Farrell is good as usual and there's a great scene between him and Duvall that will hit all fathers and sons alike. Erivo has a few nice moments but she's only in half the film. Neeson does what he can but he's not in the film much for obvious reasons.McQueen here is on top of his game. He got the actors in top form and his pacing of the film is excellent. He uses the city of Chicago as not only a backdrop but a character. There's a got long take where Farrell is talking to his aid riding from the slums to the rich neighbor. McQueen uses the scene so well to show off his filmmaking and storytelling skills. When the action hit, it's fast and furious. Not that I want him to do a big budget action film but he no doubt has the talent to shoot one. Honestly, if Sony let the reigns off a Bond film, I think McQueen would be a perfect choice to direct one. There's an excellent shootout chase to open the film that's intercut with a nice character moment. And that final moment in the film almost made me stand up and cheer. It's such a great way to wrap up the film.Widows is in the vein of Heat. That is the first film I could compare to this walking out of the theater. This is a tense dramatic heist film with sprinkles of action. Where Heat is a dramatic action film with a lot of firepowers. What Widows lacks in firepower it has in performances that make up for the action. Davis, Debicki, and Kaluuya shine with the whole cast getting a good moment. That's the problem with the most action film. The characters don't get time to develop or get their moment. McQueen makes sure that everyone has a moment. This is no doubt one of the best films of 2018 and a crime (no pun intended) that the film is not getting awards season love.",Widows
267,stephenbishop-22925,Disappointing,4,1 March 2019,"Considering it was screenplayed by Gillian Flynn, this has got to be one of the slowest films I have seen.

269,cinemawithcj,Widows - Cinema with CJ Review,8,1 December 2018,"Widows is a project that marries two brilliant creatives. After loving Steve McQueen's two most recent films (I still haven't seen Hunger) plus having my eyes opened to Gillian Flynn via Gone Girl, when I first read they were trying to work together on something I was filled with excitement.What they have brought to screens is Widows, surprisingly based on an ITV production of the same name. In execution it fits perfectly in their wheelhouse, with Flynn co-writing such strong female leads, tackling all sorts of themes and throwing in all manner of nicely spooled turns expected in the heist genre.Beyond direction and writing the final lynchpin before filtering through the rest of a brilliant collaboration is the always perfect Viola Davis. Every role she plays makes it feel like no-one else could have played it, she's just that formidable as an acting force. And you get the full range from her here, making you buy into her reactions and dealing with the situation, you are ready to watch how she tackles adversity and fight her way through to the end.The rest of the ensemble deserve all of the props, whether it's Debicki, Rodriguez, or Erivo, or Farrell or Duval, Henry, or even Kaluuya, who himself plays such an wonderfully intense and threatening foe you feel tense around in every scene he's in.Widows sounds and at times is high concept, it's by no means a Heat, but the heist pulled off by widows of professional criminals pulls you in. What is more worth noting is how despite the ensemble and the idea, Widows is executed so subtle, and understated. McQueen can do so much with so little, and that's full force here. The camera is calculated, and the editing is succinct, where subtext and inference is king. McQueen knows his audience is intelligent, so he never spells it out for us. Which is refreshing, and makes for a damn fine voice in film.Widows is the well oiled machine of so many perfect parts coming together, and it has all of the substance you'd look for beyond the style. Corruption, politics, race, gender, generations, interracial marriage, extortion, so many ideas are tackled and handled wonderfully here.It's not perfect, which is a shame, but with so much going right for it, of course there are some trip-ups on the journey. Some plot threads sorta fizzle towards the end of them. Some sorta go unmentioned. The exploration of some characters to such an extent means that others fall by the wayside. It doesn't carry enough emotional weight to move you and it doesn't quite propel you to utterly love every second.Much like the heist the film is built around, Widows is calculated. But like most movie heists, there's always something that isn't quite to plan that stops it being the perfect job.",Widows

Elizabeth Debicki doesn't steal the film but she nearly does. New to me, this 6'2"" Australian actress is extraordinary. But she doesn't dominate because everybody in the film is great, which reveals the skill of the director, Steve McQueen. He also wrote the screenplay with Gillian Flynn, basing it on the Lynda La Plante British tv original. A truly great movie I must see again. And again. And the dog! It nearly skewers the best acting role all by itself. Robert Duvall, Daniel Kaluuya, Liam Neeson, and Colin Farrell all play brilliantly but in support of Viola Davis, Carrie Coon, Michelle Rodriguez, and Elizabeth Debicki, who dominate. And another wonderful woman, Sade, sings a great song near the end. Hans Zimmer again underpins the film with his growly score.

Other than extremely politicized a few, that hasn't worked because the audience wants to see realistic humans and their stories, not the weak reflections of abstract ideologies/politics forcedly embedded in a storyline. This movie tells a female empowerment tale without falling into the pitfalls of its comtemporaries.The widows in this movie are far from being perfect. They are as deeply flawed as their husbands and that's what makes them more relatable.

285,SGuiliano1064972,"WIDOWS, a very entertaining and wild heist thriller.",8,25 November 2018,"The reason I gave this film an 8 rating because of Viola Davis.Widows is a crime drama thriller directed by Steve McQueen (12 Years a Slave) and written by Gillian Flynn (Gone Girl, Sharp Objects) and McQueen. It focuses on several widows whose husbands were killed in a robbery shoot out.
Top notch performances by the cast Liam Neeson (He's always good in any film), Davis, Colin Farrell, Daniel Kaluuya and Michelle Rodriguez.
The film begins with a Bang! McQueen takes the audience where the wives of the slain husbands must try to figure out another heist planned by Neeson, who plays Davis' husband. The film is action packed but with a little bit of confusion on the story line when you follow through with it. Yet, this is not HEAT (1995), nowhere ever. But it's witty with a plot twist which I won't write here in my review. Though, Viola Davis carries this film throughout, though the Women are at first confused on what to do to pull out this heist but slowly, they begin to execute it diligently. The film deals with sexism, racism and politics as you may know this film takes place in Chicago. Rating - 8.0",Widows
286,naaarfDE,Social drama in disguise,9,3 February 2019,"WIDOWS is a lot more than a well crafted crime thriller.

290,taranpannu01,Widows (2018),10,24 November 2018,"Sharp, Stylistic and Stunning.Steve McQueen is the best director of the 21st Century and the man has only made 4 films. 4 brilliant films that evoke raw emotion, relay important themes and give a new meaning to what cinema is really all about.I've been a McQueen fan for years and I am not downplaying my bias for the man, but god damn has he pulled it out of the bag.Widows is brutal, gruelling, entertaining and thrilling. The entire ensemble shines, the cinematography is breathtaking, music is used to it's full potential, honestly I could go on about how McQueen excels in all areas of craft when it comes to filmmaking.Utilising his usual crew of Sean Bobbitt and Joe Walker, McQueen keeps his signature style of long takes, stillness and thematic brutality whilst delivering on a whole new level in the crime thriller genre.This is not a heist film but a character drama with a heist involved. McQueen delivers a complex, nuanced and thoroughly entertaining saga filled with hidden intricacies that eagle eyed viewers should look out for.Cinematography, Bobbitt excels with superb long takes and reflective imagery whilst Walker's editing is a shoe in for the Achievement in Editing Academy Award. The editing is just perfect, the way Walker blends Zimmer's riveting score and keeping the audience engaged is simply superb.Viola Davis is simply brilliant. She can emote without saying a word and I hope she and McQueen work again. Perhaps his new muse to take over Fassbender (whose absence I thought I'd miss but surprisingly didn't)Michelle Rodriguez whilst not as nuanced as her other cast members was still strong support as was Cynthia Erivo, although one wishes she was in it a little more.Elizabeth Debicki, Colin Farrell and Brian Tyree Henry were brilliant as the main supporting cast. Each were complex and were just as interesting as Veronica and any one of them could've been a main. Stunning performances all round.Jacki Weaver, Carrie Coon, Garrett Dillahunt, Kevin J O'Connor, Jon Michael Hill, Matt Walsh, Jon Bernthal, Molly Kunz , Manuel Garcia Ruflo and Adepero Oduye whilst some were brief, all genuinely fantastic. This film MUST get the Best Ensemble at the SAG's, this is the pure definition of acting ensemble.Robert Duvall proved he is still as fantastic as ever whilst Daniel Kaluuya completely stole the show with his terrifying performance. Liam Neeson left me jaw dropped with his best role in years, absolutely fantastic performance and he should be commended.I could genuinely go on about how McQueen is the best filmmaker of our generation or how the ensemble is stunning but all I can say is go and see Widows and then watch 'Hunger', 'Shame' and '12 Years A Slave' and tell me that my faith in McQueen as a filmmaker is falsely placed because the man is a pure and rare talent and Widows proves it.",Widows

I get the same negative vibe when I watch Sonequa Martin-Green, also an actress whose very hard to watch. This is however a personal experience. She just can't act in my opinion.There are many plot holes, scenes who don't add up. A very weird kissing scene in the first 30 seconds. I should've walked right out after that. I go to the cinema for at least 3 times a week, so I watch many movies and this movie gave the most unsatisfied feeling of all the movies I've seen this year.Watch the trailer, if you don't like what you see, don't go and save your precious money :-).",Widows
296,adaringdo-1,One of the most not-so-subtle racist movies I've ever seen.,3,13 January 2021,"I doubt this review will pass the leftist sensor, but here goes.
The actual movie isn't deserving of such a low grade, probably a 5-6 due to its acting and intense moments, but I can't give a pass on the racist, white hating, stereotyping of Caucasians being the ignorant, black hating fools this movie injects. If each character's race was reversed this movie would be deemed unshootable in today's culture.
Specifically, the subtext is that a white man hates his wife because she is black? A black son gets gunned down by white cops for no reason after a traffic stop, an event that is so rare it is implausible unless you buy into the LEFTIST race hating narrative. It is true a few blacks have been killed by police under questionable and on a very few occasions criminal circumstances, but this is SO RARE as to be a statistical anomaly and to inject this event in such a way as to indicate it is normal is the social crime of gaslighting, and a LEFTIST director is probably the only person who could do such a thing in this day and time. The intention of the director seems clear: Hate and the perpetuation of the lie of massive and uncontrolled racism by indicating these events are normal.

299,unyan,No characters to like at all,2,8 November 2018,"Why I thought to myself about half an hour in, am I watching a film filled with shady greedy violent characters I already loathe. I cared little for anyone on screen apart from the cute little dog and my major worry was that she would come to some horrifying violent end.
I only realised when they arrived at the heist venue what they were out to steal and from who as this was omitted from the script such was the obsession with politics and violent criminals up to that point.
Liam neeson dies at the beginning leaving you to immediately speculate when he will return to earn his fee so the plot twist is little surprise.
I couldn't decide whether to leave or just nod off. Hugely disappointing stuff from a normally top director but this kind of thing is not Steve's bag.

300,BlackCinemaNow,Great Movie!,9,26 November 2018,"Based on 3 women whose lives are impacted by their husbands sudden death; one including Liam Neeson character. Their husbands die owing a candidate running for alderman $2 million. Viola Davis character Veronica Rollins recruits and orchestrate the women plus one Cynthia Rivo to join them in the effort to pay back the debt. What's interesting is that each woman is given a task in preparation for the heist and how each woman utilizes their strengths to get what they need is captivating, and empowering depending on how you look at it. The movie highlights how politics is a big business ran with corruption and scams. Daniel Kaluuya definitely plays one hell of a bad guy, as he assists the candidate who he is related to in getting his money back. Spoiler alert, the plot twist reminded me of double jeopardy and definitely made me say wow. You will see today's social relevance in the film which I will leave it at that for you to figure out. Overall the movie was very entertaining with some great ""edge of your seat"" scenes, and great twist and turns. Towards the end, you will definitely get a set it off vibe as I did as you're waiting to see if they can actually pull off the heist. Definitely go check out this film!",Widows
301,kevinthecritic,"Widows: Overstuffed Heist Film Has Decent Action, Not Much Else",5,11 December 2018,"Widows has all the ingredients for a fun and thought-provoking heist movie. A solid cast, talented writer (Gillian Flynn, of Gone Girl) and director (Steve McQueen, of 12 Years a Slave), and some decent action. However, Widows fails as both fun heist film and thoughtful commentary due to bad editing, clunky dialogue, and undercooked characters and story ideas. And yet, it has received Oscar buzz. I don't know what film the other critics saw, but I found Widows a slow, tonally inconsistent, and largely uninvolving movie with fleeting moments of dark humor that would have been appreciated more frequently.Following the death of her criminal husband Harry (Liam Neeson), Veronica Rawlins (an unengaging Viola Davis) is threatened by gangster-turned-politician Jamal Manning (A good Brian Tyree Henry) to complete the heist job Harry and his friends were supposed to before their untimely deaths. Fearful but strong, Ronnie enlists the help of their widows, Linda (an underused Michelle Rodriguez) and Alice (Elizabeth Debicki) to pull it off. Meanwhile, Manning and opposing candidate Jack Mulligan (Colin Farrell) vie for the hearts (and votes) of their Chicago neighborhood through increasingly shady tactics that would make a much more engrossing movie on its own.Widows is not going to make my list of the worst of the year. The acting is passable for the most part, the few action scenes enjoyable, and the story just interesting enough to make you see where it goes. However, Viola Davis seems unenthused, the characters are barely developed, and much of the dialogue and themes are poorly handled. Colin Farrell does well as Mulligan, Daniel Kaluuya is fun as another gangster, and Robert Duvall adds some (unintended) comedy as Farrell's cartoonishly racist father. Unfortunately, the moments of dark humor clash with the more realistic tone the film mostly goes for and only made me wish it would just go goofy all the way. There's also a jarringly unrealistic police shooting in the film that took my audience by surprise in the wrong way and should have been left out. While I can admire Widows for its higher ambitions in theory, in practice, the film bites off far more than it can chew. Skip it.Rated R for Violence, Language Throughout, and Some (awkwardly placed) Sexual Content/Nudity",Widows

Directed, produced, and written by Steve McQueen, the movie feels like it wants to be his but is clearly the studio's work. Maybe I don't know the guy as much as I would like to believe. The movie is very Hollywood-y and emphasizes the woody because the movie is dry, without trying to be that. Very cliche and written with a lot of amateurish mistakes. The acting and photography are great and there are even some references to the director's previous work which distracted me a little. One of the soundtracks composed by Hans Zimmer strangely reminds me of the ""Once upon a time in America"" main theme and the music, in general, was fine but uninspired.In short, this is a solid chick flick and the female dynamic Quattro has nice chemistry.

310,karmazyn,Dont mourn girl....ACT ! WATCH IT !,8,8 May 2019,"I will tell you what we have here. A good, crime drama, thats what we have. This is movie about real woman who are about discover how to survive in the man dominated world. Against all odds female cast is forced to work together to ensure continuity of their existence. When man dies and our female heroines want to maintain good standard of living instead of going to work, quick cashing in sounds like better alternative for them, right? So we have fantastic acting here. There are lots of stars in this movie, everyone played really well. Among all of the great stars who played in the movie we have brilliant Viola Davis playing Veronica - a brain behind whole operation. Against all odds she unites with Alice ,played by Elizabeth Debicki, Linda, our lovely and all fans favourite Michelle Rodriguez, and Belle, super athletic Cyntia Erivo. All of them lost their husbands in the heist that went wrong and Victoria who inherited her late husband (Liam Neesons) next heist's plans is forced to carry on heist in order to save herself from just a little bit crazy in the head Jatemme played by Daniele Kaluuya. Lets not forget about Collin Farrell and Brian Tyree Henry who are in the movie to remind us that when it comes to money and power, greed and sick ambition do not distinguish between where you come from, when the game's stakes are high you will be dirty just like anyone else. Movie is tense, well directed and I encourage everyone to watch it. Most of the actors are well characterized in their roles and offer genuine, well rounded perspective on how is to try to survive in mighty Chicago. The plot can get little predictable but it does not matter much as movie is masterfully done. I give it 8/10 and encourage you to watch it.",Widows

312,ssnake_z,The real Oceans 8,9,22 August 2019,"WIDOWS
RATING: 4.7/5Saw this on a recommendation and I gotta admit, I was thoroughly impressed. I was a little worried at first because the director came on before the film, which is usually a bad sign these days, but it was pretty solid. Think of it as a better version of ""Oceans 8"" with the All Women Heist stuff, just a lot more serious with a much better story.The movie takes a lot of time to establish the characters, where they're at in their lives, and why they have to go through with the heist, once they lose their husbands. In that regard, it can be a little slow but the characters are interesting enough to keep the whole thing moving forward at a good pace. Not to mention, the movie sets up a lot of players, but somehow manages to keep the film feeling personal, due to how much time it spends setting up the protagonists. Despite all the players, the film never feels crowded, no matter how much is going on. The film even occasionally takes a time out to remind you that these women are still grieving, despite everything they're having to plan and set up for the heist. I thought that was a smart thing to show.When you finally do get to the heist, it moves pretty fast compared to the rest of the film. It also feels very grounded because you've been with these women through all the prep work, which I very much liked. If I had to say anything negative about this film, other than a few nitpicks, I wish they had an epilogue or some kind of wrap up, at the end. There are so many moving pieces in the film that when it ends, you're left wondering what happened to some of the characters, on a personal level. The aftermath of these widows heist has some pretty big ramifications that really should have been shown. A news report on a TV, in the background no less, just doesn't cut it. Other than that, I'd say WIDOWS is definitely a film worth seeing.",Widows

It seems to have been done (although it could be a trick) all in one shot, and without really noticing, you realise we have gone from one sort of American life to another in no time at all.McQueen really keeps the politics low-key and subtle, but it is there; more as part of the setting than centre stage.

316,huey2088,What a cliche,4,8 February 2019,"I heard a lot about this movie without knowing who directed it. When the credits started to roll, I was surprised it was by Steve McQueen and Gillian Flynn. His 12 Years a Slave was an eye opener and guilt inducing. But Widows is nothing like his previous masterpiece. It is more an action, less drama with a little hint of comedy, a few twists thrown in and a lot of cliche kind of movie.With Black Lives Matter, #Metoo and new wave of feminism in every form of media, it's on trend to make women the protagonists (Davis, Rodriguez, Debicki and Erivo - the latter is a bystander who got involved mainly for money) hence the title. The racism carried out by white men onto black people also plays an important theme as if McQueen couldn't decide which topic he wanted to focus on so let's mix them together in the narrative.The African Americans aren't victims either - only the females are. The excellent Kaluuya morphs into Gary Oldman's Stansfield from Leon (1994). A violence loving thug who interrogates and tortures his victims - one being a disabled man who gets stabbed in his legs to see if he can feel the pain - to get what his politician brother (Henry) needs to win the upcoming election. I am sure his character is included just to please the horror loving fans.With so many characters, Widows weaves in and out of flashbacks. The problem is the actors onscreen time are not only spliced up but the story is also rushed through. I refuse to believe that someone inexperienced, who has never held a gun before can plan and pull off a heist like these women in the space of a month. There are so many loopholes to the plot, it is laughable or as one reviewer wrote - plainly eye rolling stuff.The acting is great although perhaps too much but let's leave Kaluuya have his fun. Davis is extraordinary, she can cry heavy tears without prompting. Debicki is the dumb naive blonde she has played before. Duvall is his usual grumpy old man self. I could go on but there are just too many.Widows doesn't really hit the mark. The female heist plot has been done before and better in Ocean's 8. It just feels like another cookie cutter Hollywood production about racism, sexism and injustice amongst the lower class - all the rage at the moment. It also hastily does the cultural representation thing - Duvall's Asian live in nurse with only one spoken line if I remember correctly. What's the point? Because it's expected now.And by following what is expected and what people are talking about, you get this mishmash convoluted movie that is doing its rounds like a viral post. McQueen needs to stop listening to what everyone expects and do a movie that entertains rather than educates.",Widows

Include entirely implausible plot elements (I won't include any spoilers, but one involves a kiss and the other an army of cops only at one door in a building) and an ending I'd rather not have seen, and you have the summation of this movie.

The story highlights the subject of the woman's condition, of all kinds of discrimination, a topic that does not seem particularly exciting to me for an action movie.The film's script is pretentious, it wants to inspire a complexity worthy of metaphysical topics.

332,boophillips,Brilliant if you like a layered film not just explosions,8,5 May 2019,"I think the main issue with this film (as is evidenced by the extreme scores in either direction here on IMDB) is that the marketing set the wrong tone for the film. It made it seem like some high octane heist film, and the reality is that it's a nuanced, layered film with character development which encourages the viewer to look at the 'why' of things. The heist aspect is relegated to just 15/20 mins of the film. The rest is building a picture and characters.The thing that really stood out to me when watching this was how McQueen made us second guess pretty much every single character. Everyone has faults, everyone has the potential to double cross. I loved that. I was surprised several times at which direction a character ended up going in.I thought it walked the line between drama, thriller and action film really well. It felt weighty but entertaining. I wish it had been a little longer and that there was more time to see people's story arcs through to a more conclusive end and so that some of the more minor characters (and the interesting political sub plot) was More fully realised.

333,lucianolvr,Guess Who's Coming To Dinner.....or for Chicago Pizza,6,3 March 2019,"Pretty much really liked this movie. Have some serious concerns, however. I rented the movie from Redbox and knew NOTHING about it. Hadn't heard one thing about it or read anything. So, I really enjoyed the pacing. I loved learning about Chicago, because I have never been there. Also, when you view the film at home you can rewind and try to figure out a scene or sentence that you didn't get the first time around. I would imagine that if I had seen this movie in a theater I would not rate it as high as I have here. I also took a two hour break to go to the store before watching the second half of the movie, and that helped. Still, I found it pretty riveting!
This review is going to have major spoilers, so please stop reading here if you don't know what happens in the film. Again, I loved how the movie took me on a visual viewing of Chicago, especially that scene where Jack Mulligan (Colin Farrell's character) leaves the projects and ends up, in one uncut scene, in his extremely sweet, tree lined house in an upper scale neighborhood. Shows how fast the transition from poverty and struggle geographically goes to gentrification, class and privilege in almost a heartbeat. Also the conversation in the car was intelligent, how his secretary (assistant? future wife?) knew exactly what he was doing, wondering if all black guys were more endowed than him.I do believe I heard a little Irish accent coming from Colin at one point, and this threw me. His dad (Tom Mulligan, played brilliantly by Robert Duval) is completely American, and even though they are Irish Catholics I don't see why Jack Mulligan would have even a hint of an Irish accent. Unless he was doing a ""lucky charms"" impression for fun. Uh, but this movie was not about fun.I loved the premise that a gorgeous white hunk was in love with a lovely black woman, not ""beautiful"" in the classic sense, and how it just showed it as being a natural, non issue, loving marriage. I suppose now in hindsight all of Veronica's loving memories of Harry were a bit enhanced. How could he act so completely in love with her when he was planning on completely screwing her and leaving her with a giant, dangerous debt? Not only does he dump her for a white girl, the girlfriend of his team mate who he betrays and murders, but he lets Veronica think that he is dead. He really shows no concern at all for her mental wellbeing. Not only did they lose their child together, but he is ready to kill her at the end of the movie for money? Really? That for me was hard to swallow as they didn't show Veronica as having any clue whatsoever that he was a monster that had crawled out of the Black Lagoon.The scene where he was exposed to be alive, in the closet, was great. I loved how she did not open the door, as you expect her to. However, you are left wondering if she knows that he a) had an affair with the Amanda character or b) figures out that he is STILL ALIVE!!I don't like being able to figure out too much in a movie, but the scene in the garage where the van blows up was too obvious for me that it might have been a dead body in the driver seat. And of course the fact that it's Liam Neeson plants the doubt in your head how he can be killed off so early in the movie. So, I thought that it might be a dead body.Let's talk about all the characters in the movie. There wasn't one character that I really liked. The widows aside, every character (except for Bash) sucked. It's one of those Sopranos problems where every character is described as being so base. Who isn't corrupt? For me that's hard to take. From the detective that's bribed to not investigate whether the bodies in the van are actually the criminals the cops are after, to the mortician who is corrupt and provides a dead body, to every single other lead character in the movie, it's just too much, sorry. Real life ain't like that. There's always a good little person running around, honest, trying to do right in every situation. So that's a major flaw as far as I'm concerned.Also, the beautiful blonde (Alice, played by Elizabeth Debicki) has only her looks in the movie. Seems like a cliche. Yes, her own mother is a nightmare who wants to pimp her out, but you would think in this day and age Alice would see herself as having options other than selling her body. And the fact that the only nude scene in the movie is with this classic blonde beauty was a let down, again, why should this actress be the only one who has to strip naked to make the movie good? Just because she's beautiful she's the only one? As a woman I would like to have seen a nude scene with Neeson, or a nice looking dude.It was fun seeing Lukas Haas and recognizing him from Witness as little Samuel. Shane also had a small role in this movie, and I always want to see more of him. What took off the final 4 stars of the movie for me was the ending, and how it is not clear whether Veronica gives the money back to Jamal Manning or not. He is owed 2 million dollars. If she does pay it back, each woman gets approximately 750K. But it doesn't explain what she does with it. Also, what about that getaway car that the women jump in to go after Jatemme Manning after he robs them of their booty? Did Veronica know ahead of time that he was going to do that, and so she had a back up car nearby so that she could pursue him?A few other little questions:
a) Did she know that Harry would be at the garage to rob her? She didn't seem too surprised.
b) What about the van bought at auction? Was that bought with a fake ID? otherwise it could be traced back to Alice.
c) Wouldn't the woman have to launder their money, for example when Linda goes and gets herself a store again? Wouldn't the feds wonder where that cash came from?
d) The gunshot victim of Alice, taken to the hospital. Yes, she is using a fake name of Jennifer, and yes, Linda tells the EMTs that it was a drive by. But the hospital would have to have been close enough to the house that was just broken into and robbed, and where Tom Mulligan was shot and murdered. Wouldn't the Chicago PD first look at gunshot wound victims in a hospital? And wouldn't her blood be easily identified through DNA at the scene of the crime? That was a big hole for me.Finally, the shooting of the mixed race son. Shaking my head. This was necessary to the film, how? Cops don't just murder people in cold blood like that. I know that ""certain movement groups"" like to portray that. (I don't know how much imdv will censor here so I'm not using the movement's name). To continue to portray cops as murderers is dangerous, disrespectful and getting real old real fast. Also, as a young black man his mother would have taught him never to reach for anything in the car as soon as he is pulled over. Hands go straight up, hands are seen the whole time, this is survival. That scene just looked like a modern day, PC statement tacked into the movie which turned me off. Also if it had happened that way there would have been a giant movement with protests and media and Veronica's face would not be anonymous. People would know her.Other than the problems listed above, the movie was captivating, interesting, and good!",Widows
334,andreasz-2381,Best is the Trailer,4,24 November 2018,Trailer was full of hope. Too good cast for a long-winded movie which need to long time building up any tension. Great story idea but bad cinematic realisation.,Widows
335,spuddcw2000-1,Some things worked; A whole bunch did not.,4,16 November 2018,"Few of us writing can direct a movie so opining on someone else's work while easy is done with an implied message that we could do better. Seldom do I think I could. In this case, I believe I could make a credible attempt at it. I see the budget is listed at $40M. Undoubtedly this had to go to paying the cast; about whom 50% could be eliminated easily. Robert DuVal has, I think 3 scenes. One where he discusses campaign strategy with his son,Colin Farrel who is looking to take over his seat. Liam Nesson is barely in the movie as well but did have key plot points. Why they need a A minus actor for his part is unknown to this author.The parts that didn't work is largely story based. There is an election. There is a heist. There are street thugs. There is death of the main protagonist youth at the hands of the police. There is the lobbying for an endorsement from a megachurch pastor. There is a philandering spouse. There is a faked death. There is a notebook that ties it all together. The director should get credit for creating multi faceted and deeply textured characters. But did we need to see that the baby-sitter had babies of her own? Did we need to see that a street tough was learning another language via CD in his vehicle? Did we need to have a bar/bowling alley owner who.... Did we need to have a chemically dependent driver (who apparently was a driver for the guy who was a getaway driver for a crime crew???). You really need a score card to keep track. Once the story gets going which is a very long time in coming, some of the parts come together that were not obvious but others just fall away with no rhyme or reason for their being there in the first place. It comes out on the day I'm writing this so I won't go too far into the details but suffice to say that the characters do not always act in ways that are smart, predictable, or even in their best interest which breathes the breath of these actions being contrived.What works very well is far more plentiful. There are a lot of unbalanced equations in this film. If you're expecting a bunch of 007 type quips where the dashing anti-hero makes a humorous comment after vanquishing their foes; you'll be disappointed. This is a gritty (albeit not gruesome) film where the ""widows"" take on a very masculine tone themselves. The bad guys are very bad; nobody is 100% clean in this movie which both makes you happy and sad. There are some very interesting camera angles that build drama. One of which is a 30+ second scene where the actors are not on camera but their vehicle is; you hold your breath waiting for something to happen to the car. And I've never been to Chicago but I would imagine the churches in the town looking just the way they looked in this film; I could imagine the roads looking the way they look. I could definitely imagine the politics being tough as well. These things worked very well. Even the casting of Elizabeth Debicki who stands 6'2"" is one of those bouts of incongruence that run through out the film.So in summary, it is worth a look but the confusing, unbelievable story drowns out a lot of the better things of the film.",Widows
336,Michele7169,I was so excited.. only to be let down..REALLY let down!,2,23 January 2019,"I was so excited to see this film..especially after seeing The director's previous works ( Twelve Years a Slave, Hunger) but my gosh I don't see why the writers felt the need to fit in sooo many social lessons or stereotypes in one film! This is why movie sales have gone way down in recent years! We want to see great movies with amazing storyline. This is NOT that!
More hate for the white man..let's squeeze in the #metoo movement..oh let's not forget to add the racist cop shooting an African American kid..oops..we also need spousal abuse and a cheating spouse. ..oh can we fit in some prostitution? Men suck..women are awesome! Come on! It builds you up for this amazing heist that is supposed to happen..but heist fell flat!! Very disappointing. All the SJW's will be on here praising it because that's obviously the goal here..not a good movie! Way to many story lines, the amazing actors could have done this in their sleep. This was collassal waste of my time and my money.",Widows
337,mram16,"This film contains two movies, and I enjoyed one of them",6,21 November 2018,"Widows is the story of a trio of...well, widows, who hatch a scheme to pull off a heist. The reason why the widows choose to pull off this heist in the first place is a threat by gangster-turned-political-hopeful Jamal Manning (played by Brian Tyree Henry). It was his money that the deceased husbands of the women were trying to steal before dying in an explosion set off by a hail of police bullets. The money burned up in the flames, and he wants to be repaid. Veronica Rawlings (played by Viola Davis) comes into possession of the plans for a future robbery that her husband Harry (played by Liam Neeson) was planning, and with no other options she and the other women decide to use the plans to commit the robbery themselves in order to pay off the debt (with plenty of money left over).The cast does a commendable job, with particularly good performances put forth by Viola Davis and Elizabeth Debicki as two of the titular widows, Cynthia Erivo as the babysitter for a third widow (played by Michelle Rodriguez) who gets brought into the scheme, and Get Out's Daniel Kaluuya as a cold-blooded henchman who doesn't need to walk around screaming and shouting in order to be terrifying. Also worth a mention is Robert Duvall, who may not be in the movie a whole lot but is memorable nonetheless. The film is shot well by cinematographer Sean Bobbitt, with one standout scene being the short drive taken by Colin Farrell's Chicago Machine political candidate from an area of blight to the nice, quiet street that he lives on at the edge of the ward where he hopes to be elected as alderman over his opponent (Manning). The camera watches as rundown inner-city buildings give way to nice houses that wouldn't seem out of place in a tidy little suburb.For a while it is interesting to watch as the women, who were not involved in their respective husbands' lives of crime, try to ready themselves for the heist. Midway through the film, however, there's a surprise reveal. I said in the title of this review that this film contained two movies, one that I liked I liked. The movie that I liked ended with this ""twist"", and this is where the movie that I didn't like began. Not only is the twist totally unnecessary, but the film just seems to go downhill from there. The women, whose robbing skills seemed understandably shoddy up to this point, suddenly seem to work together like a well-oiled machine. There are more twists thrown into the mix (such as the identity of the person they will be stealing from). The fate of the Rawlings' son, hinted at earlier in the movie. is revealed in a poorly executed scene. The climax of the film feels like a second-rate action flick, and the playing-out of the big twist revealed earlier in the film feels contrived. Then the film ends in a, ""Really, that's how they're going to end this?"" way.I don't hate this film (faint praise, I know), but I feel that there was so much wasted opportunity. If only they had kept making the movie from the first half of this film I could have given it a higher rating, but as it stands I give it a 6 out of 10.",Widows
338,mrivas-42691,Feels partly empty despite so much filler.,5,27 January 2019,The movie was decent. It got boring along various parts. I felt like the movie left too many loose ends which is only made worse by the fact that it is more than 2 hours long and at least 1/4 of the runtime was unnecessary scenes that felt out of place and added nothing to the movie. The heist also fell rushed and empty- feels like there's soooo much build up to it then it just happens in like 5 minutes.,Widows

Now, I will tell you, this movie packs a lot of layers and there is a lot going on throughout the entirety of the film. However, I absolutely loved it. With quips of Tarantino, Ocean's 11, The Score, The Sting, Ozark and Place Beyond the Pines, we get six movies in one. With some comedic elements sprinkled throughout and some absolutely incredible camera work, we get Widows.Now, I can see why a lot of people won't like this movie. It's just sort of a polarizing film. I feel like people either hate it or they love it. Judging by my movie tastes and what I recommend to friends that they always come back to tell me they hated, I'm not expecting many of them to like it.But, just know this. From the opening scenes, Widows will grip you and have you sitting on the edge of your seat. With deliberate sound and camera techniques connected to gun violence throughout the film, McQueen shows politics, corruption, racism, nepotism, poverty, struggle, gender inequalities, stereotypes, a city in turmoil and so much more in this film.Go see this movie!",Widows

341,Erick_Till,Collection of dangerous prejudices.,4,21 August 2021,"As ""ferguson-6"" said very well in his review, Steve McQueen, defines the film from the following premises: ""Woman power- Black Power-Racist Old White Men-Corrupt Politicians-Abusive Husbands-Cheating White Husbands-Racist Cops- Men are Bad and obviously women are strong and good.This is a collection of stereotypes that are probably part of what the filmmaker believes. Steve, obviously to me, has lost his credibility. Being good or bad, honest or corrupt, is independent of gender and other factors.Either way, the movie is bad, slow, naive, full of holes, inconsistent characters and certainly incapable of robbing a convenience store.This story is more worn than my old jeans.

I liked it quite a lot and thought Viola was going to be great in the lead role.Given the cast/crew involved I had some decently high expectations going in. The movie exceeded them all. I was just blown away.The original story was set in the UK, of course, and had a lot of details that were very specific to that location and the time/era that it was made in. This movie takes the core concepts of the original, the motivations, the psychology, the emotions and transports them to Chicago in our present era. Making the movie just as true to the place and time as the series was. You can feel that the screenwriter understood the locations and people in this story.From the best I can recall, the movie sticks to the plot of the first series/season of the show only. Which I feel is a good choice, given the somewhat uneven tone of the second series. But while the basic events are largely the same, the details are appropriately different. This doesn't feel like a cheap reboot that someone slapped together in an afternoon brainstorm. They didn't copy&replace the names of the characters. The new versions are unique and whole people in their own right, with motivations that are similar but significantly different than the originals.My friend and I attended this together, and she had not seen the original series. She found the movie to be equally compelling as an original work. Which to men says that none of the choices in what changes to make disrupted the core story.I cannot wait to get this on video.

The story was interesting, the cinematography was great, the acting was top notch. It was a slow build for sure, but it kept me interested. The it gets to the end and everything felt rushed and a little forced. Also, when she finds out her husband is alive and then kills him, that felt a little forced. The whole Liam Neeson being alive thing didn't feel necessary. And there were a few things that I felt had no real payoff, like the Colin Farrell story arc. I'd say it's worth a watch because there were som very good scenes throughout, but as an overall whole, it feels slightly unsatisfying.",Widows

Relatively realistic and enough side plots to warrant the run time.The only thing I can say as a negative is that I don't think this one has great replayability.

Also the main boss played by the actor from Get Out was a mistake. He was very unbelievable as the head of a crime family.
This Movie needed to be streamlined. I understand this was based on a British tv show which makes sense. I believe this would have worked better as limited series on HBO or Netflix or something.
Also and this is petty but many scenes looked as though they were shot in the dark. This is a relatively new trend I can't stand! I want to see what I'm looking at and the actors expressions. I don't want to strain my eyes to see.
Ultimately there are some interesting concepts and great talent but it never fully comes together causing me to lose a large degree of interest. Also all viola had to do is kill her husband and Robert Duval and steal the money to get the crime lords off her back? Really!?!",Widows

354,robertdelpopolo,So long yet so shortlived,4,1 December 2018,"Spoilers ahead: Harry is a coldblooded thief whose motives throughout the film are unclear and dont make much sense. He kills his crew without remorse and does so for a relatively small amount of money (1 million). This is so that he can later on be revealed to be alive. He even goes so far as to shoot his wife at one point. Another thing that makes little sense is Harry's affair, as that would have been a bad idea considering he KILLS HER HUSBAND and he stays without having to (he replies ""I know"" when asked about this).
The plot about their son Marcus seems to be some sort of activist idea, being shot by a cop, which makes no sense as he was driving an expensive car. So deep.Jon Bernthal is in the movie for less than Liam Neeson which is saying alot, its about 10 seconds and too minutes for each. Alice and Linda seem to be thrown in to the movie as an after thought, neither of these characters go anywhere. Alice is encouraged to be a sugarbaby by her mother, which conveniently helps out later on when she needs specific information. That plotline is hardly explored, which could have been quite interesting TBH as I have never seen a SB/SD relationship on screen. She also seems to be the onscreen punching bag, why is this woman so helpless? One of the only interesting scenes in the movie is when Alice is acquiring a gun, which could have been longer. The only redemption for Linda is that she as Michelle Rodriguez misses all the shots she fires. Thats literally all she does.In the way that only a book could have set up, characters coming out of nowhere to conveniently help the plot along. Such as Belle who happens to be Lindas babysitter who conveniently becomes the driver. There is a whole plotline about politics and their corresponding dark sides, but it never goes anywhere and its supposed to act as a springboard for the heists. I didnt care about either of these men losing money and the fact of the matter is that the heist lacks any substance because of it.
The beginning heist is about a minute and the end one about 2. So much buildup just to end up aprubtly. During the heist itself there are two complications which happen to be quickly resolved and theyre hardly a problem. Which is even stupider because they just happen to kill somebody by driving in the back of his car.This brings us to the main villain, one of Jamals henchmen, who has nothing going for him other than being a nutbag psycho. The scenes with him lack tension and yes, he is an evil dude, but his motivations are unclear and honestly as cold as he was, it wasnt threatening or all that exciting to watch.One of the better performances is the Reverend who has a very good little segment, as well as the Auctioneer, he was hilarious in an otherwise bland movie, from which I was bored way too many times.One of the saving graces is the cinematography which brings a couple of cool perspectives on driving shots, and there is a pretty cool one take going from a speech into the mansion.This movie is CLEARLY a DRAMA.

Mr. McQueen are you ready to show us your presentation?It's always hard trying to make a fun movie that is also smart and interesting and makes you think after you see it. It's not like mindless popcorn flicks are bad inherently, but the problem is how often they feel disposable. Like every time a new blockbuster comes out in the small vain of becoming a hit franchise/cinematic universe, they usually get forgotten or under-perform, and that's largely due to apathy from the audience for not really caring about anything else besides seeing a mindless action flick. They are disposable because the audience asks for disposable films. Which is why it is sad to see a movie as great as Widows under-perform (THANKS A LOT FOX), but at the same time when you have a movie as well constructed as this, I can't help but feel like that it will have a great chance on streaming/award season. Either way this movie is fantastic!What makes this movie work are the characters. We care for these ladies doing a man's job, not because of some cheap sense of girl power, but because these area actual characters with actual problems. They are extremely well round and also relatable and understandable too where the audience actively root for them to win. A large thanks to this from co-screenwriter Gillian Flynn, most known for writing Gone Girl and the adaptation to said book. She is a talented writer and I'm glad to see her become a successful screenwriter outside of her own works. Also it doesn't help that the acting is amazing. Viola Davis anchors this film as the lead, delivering a powerful but grounded performance here. It honestly felt like she's playing Amanda Waller in a GOOD movie (Viola Davis is a really good actress, but she was terrible in Suicide Squad because she was given nothing to work with). Everyone else is great in this movie, with Elizabeth Debicki and Daniel Kaluuya (who is terrifying mind you) giving my favorite supporting performances, but that's not to undervalue everyone else, as Collin Farrell, Cynthia Erivo, Brian Tyree Henry, Robert Duvall, and Liam Neeson are great too. Even Michelle Rodriguez is great here too (albeit giving some spotty deliveries here and there) and does show that she seriously can do better than the Fast and Furious franchise.Steve McQueen is great here at directing too. The cinematography is crisp and precise, and even showcasing some damn good blocking and camera shots. Like that car scene is some of the best film-making of the year and showcases smart storytelling! Even the color choices is great too, showing that Steve McQueen is making a ton of conscious choices too with the sets and costumes. The heist is also amazing too and definitely got me on the edge of my seat! Clearly Steve McQueen should do more action thrillers in the future! I also liked how the politics of the movie is done in a subtle and non-confrontational way too, letting the audience think about what's going on with the environment and dialogue but not drawing attention to it, which while I would have preferred for it to be a little bit more open about the political subtext personally, it certainly shows that there is way more to this film!I can't think of too many issues I had with this film. Like sometimes the dialogue can be a little bit hammy, and the twist in the film was too ridiculous for this film, but I wouldn't say it derailed this film too much. It's just a really tight film and I am happy to see it again! Definitely worth watching!",Widows

368,filmaniacist,No use of potential,4,1 December 2018,"It is with great disappointment I feel the urge to write this review - mainly because of how critically acclaimed this film has been since its release and also because I bought a £18 ticket to watch something not worth it. The plot, the inconsistency throughout 2h09min, the character depth and let me tell you about the biggest disappointment; the first few scenes you're compelled into the loving world of Veronica and Harry - they're compassionate, caring, loving and just a end-product of a healthy and prosperous relationship. And what happens if not that they try to kill each other by the end of the film?! Utterly and completely poor. Not because something so beautiful was destroyed, but because there was no basis to support his side of actions, as if Mcqueen (Flynn) couldn't decide on a ending so they went with the stupidest just to keep the film 'unpredictable'. They were however, parts which justified the unpredictability - for instance, when they were robbed during their robbery (not considered done until you get to the safe house) by Jatemme, and he drives off with their van and then suddenly a car crash into the van from behind and he dies and it was the women, they take the money and leave for the second time (which also questions the credibility, whose car was it, did they steal it, and how did they steal it, with no street credit at all?). Just lack of background, character depth, importance of plot and foundation for it, line of story - all of a sudden they were pulling off the heist, no buildup whatsoever, disallowing the audience to actually feel the adrenaline and excitement and actually support the women; because there was reason to actually feel for them, the losses they endured and how they endured it and how innocent they were; the background of Alice, who seems the most fragile of them because of what other characters think of her (her mother, who wants her to become a prostitute because she doesn't think she has anything else than looks) but who then proves everyone wrong and takes initiative in finding out about the drawing by using her temporary sugar daddy. She not only excels as a character but she becomes Veronica's favorite, who is the alpha in the mess - while mourning her husband, Manning steps into her penthouse and demands $2million, a debt her late husband left after him. She then embarks on a journey, which in the beginning is interesting, to find out what he left her (a notebook of the heist) and what she has to do to get the $2million, but then it gets boring - dragged out, inconsistent, weird; shouldn't she be the one to buy a van, guns and figure out what that piece of paper meant and not hand it over to people who she doesn't know at all? Along the way, the couples longtime friend and driver is murdered by Manning's men and there's really not much to it. And Linda, with two children, was firstly assigned to the piece of drawing, used her Spanish to get to the architect of the drawing, but then messed up when the architects husband opened the door and tells her she is dead. And then she confessed her husband had died recently as well and then they kiss???
What I liked the most was how four completely different women could work together and pull the heist off, without any help from a man - it showed, not only the empowerment of women in Hollywood but also that it was validated -there's not many films with three leading actresses in a blockbuster (Ocean's 8 fine) and I appreciated the film for it. And I liked the works of Sean Bobbit, whose cinematography told a story in the story and which made the visual aspect worthy, as when Jack held a little presentation in a segregated area and walked over to the car and sat in it and the camera kept rolling on top of the hood of the car as he had a discussion with his assistant about him not wanting to do the work he's doing (irrelevant given the outcome of it - again no substantial meaning to dialogue) and by a turn, the camera switched to the other side of the car on the more wealthier areas of Chicago. It was refreshing and needed.
The only thing I wasn't disappointed with and which I would happily pay £18 for, was that if you bring Viola Davis, Robert Duvall, Liam Neeson, Colin Farrell, Michelle Rodriguez and Daniel Kaluuya on screen, you're never gonna be disappointed. Viola Davis outshone everyone, even if the others were great as well. Ah well, at least I can remove this one from my watchlist.",Widows

Too many new plot points with no direction. The political angle had no future. They took a simple, thrilling story about fierce women pulling off an amazing robbery, and tried to force too many 'social commentary' plot points that didn't work: the son that got shot, the election, the older politician pushing the role on his son, the shady politician and his...ummh... what? Handler? I don't even know what they intended for this movie to be about, but it definitely didn't give the robbery the centre stage as Lynda La Plante clearly intended in her book.

375,cetaylor3,Be forewarned.,2,18 February 2019,"This is the film (which I saw last night) that made me realize there needs to be a separate advisory for ""Sadistic Violence."" This is what I just wrote the MPAA in fact:Having just watched the first hour of ""Widows"" last night made me realize (on behalf of my husband as well) that you need to identify Sadistic Violence in movies. It is a whole other beast from 'run of the mill' violence, and viewers should be forewarned. Such a category would include torture (which is - arguably? - inherently sadistic) but would be broader enough to include films such as Widows that might be more 'gray area' vis-a-vis torture but not gray at all regarding inarguably sadistic violence by a major, recurring character in the film. An hour into it, we quit watching the minute that character re-entered the story to predictably carry out more sadistic violence.While 'violence' is almost unavoidably omnipresent, as it comes with the territory of increasing numbers of films and TV (paralleling the ubiquitous contagion of food prepared with chili peppers?), including otherwise (meaning despite their violence) worthy legal or police crime dramas, and as a result we watch more of it than we wish, sadistic violence is another planet - a genre that also should have been specified in a TV series like ""Scandal"" for example.This is a consideration I hope you too will see is worthy of overdue inclusion in your ratings. Your raters surely know sadistic violence when they see it, as distinguished from (alas) routine violence, and classifying it separately would be no more subjective than classifying 'normal' violence itself.I'm sure there are plenty of others besides us who can tolerate violence up to a point but sadistic violence not at all. We need to know this in advance to make informed choices.I rented ""Widows"" on amazon prime with no clue from just the word 'violence' or even 'thriller' that it would cross the line into sadism. Amazon prime has heard my complaint - immediately last night - and my strong urging that they should give such warnings, but it really has to come from you as you are the folks who watch every film to rate it.Please take this seriously.Thank you,",Widows

380,james-60108,More woke than a Gillette Ad,1,6 October 2020,One of my favourite films was Ridley Scott's Alien. That was the epitome of showing the strength of a female character and was totally believable. It didn't feel the need to show every single male character in that film negatively. Which seems a popular trend these days. I pity my eighteen year old son having to grow up in a world where he is force fed this rubbish. The only good thing about this was that it took my attention away from the ploddingly slow story. This film had every negative male cliché. a list too long that you might begin to think that men are simply unable to play a positive role in society. It would be quite reasonable to suggest i am being hyper sensitive and a snowflake. But It seems relentlessly predictable in almost everything you see come out of Hollywood today. I am not expecting much just a little balance to this propaganda that is so transparent Joseph Goebels would be proud.

In the end what I enjoyed most was how the film illustrated Viola Davis' characters' words to her fellow widows: ""we're on our own."" While the movie speaks to race and class, it puts gender at the forefront. The female characters are truly on their own, they only have each other, since the men around them are mostly in it for themselves.

Firth, Neeson and, to a certain extent, Rodriguez are purely and simply wasted. Duvall hits two/three high notes through and through. Kaluyuu seems to come out from a Tarantino movie.

400,michaeljohnson-27597,My most disappointing film at TIFF 2018...,6,1 October 2018,"I'm reminded of an interesting experience four years ago, at TIFF 2014. Over-hearing what some people were saying online on film forums, and in line waiting for Antoine Fuqua's The Equalizer, many were discussing ""Is this a Festival film?"".It was arguably the most elitist thing I've heard about a film (and I've been to film school, where elitists thrive) because I always thought of film as something that engages everyone, and festivals are an amazing way to create awareness and engagement from the casual film-goer to those aforementioned elitists. Why Director Steve McQueen's Widows reminded me of this experience is because the two films, on the surface, have much in common. Both Fuqua and McQueen enjoyed tremendous critical success with some of their previous films, even directing actors to Oscar-winning roles. Both men are a strong proponent of this generations' growing diversification in terms of directors; mentors to help young minority filmmakers find their own voice. Both men, when releasing these respected films in the Equalizer and Widows, based the films off an older television show, and created films that have much more of an action or thriller atmosphere than their previous resume.And both, in my opinion, played it safe.When I reviewed The Equalizer, I thought it unfortunately fell back on action movie tropes and convenience; that Fuqua, who had pushed the boundaries of drama and action before, didn't take any chances. McQueen, sadly, took a page out of that book with Widows.The story follows four women, lead by Veronica (the amazing Viola Davis) who come together after Veronica's husband, Harry (Liam Neeson) and his crew of criminals are killed during a heist. Veronica then gathers most of the widows as they need to pull off another job to help settle things in their life, and with an angered gang leader, who was the individual Harry robbed. 
1.jpg
If Davis and Neeson aren't enough of a draw for you (and they should be, as they most definitely carry the film) then might I add that this is one of the greatest ensembles put together I have seen in a long time. Icons like Robert Duvall, big names like Colin Farrell, new stars like Elizabeth Debicki and Daniel Kaluuya, action mavens like Michelle Rodriguez, and some of the best actors television has offered in recent memory with names like Jon Bernthal (Walking Dead, Punisher), Carrie Coon (Fargo) and Brian Tyree Henry (Atlanta). This was the draw for me. I couldn't believe what a collective McQueen had assembled.I can only assume they believed in the project, however, after viewing the film, I no longer believe. I felt so many of the characters were stereotypes, archetypes or any other kind of type. Tom Mulligan (Duvall) and Jatemme Mannin (Kaluuya) stuck out the most. Both characters, who were antagonists were simply there to be hated, and in every way did McQueen play up the villainous tropes. Mulligan was just a mean-old-coot with all the characteristics we've come to hate about this burgeoning America; he was rich, white, racist and politically corrupt. A subtle comment on social equality and today's western world? Perhaps... but not that subtle. His character didn't even completely seem necessary. Jack Mulligan, his son (played by Colin Farrell) was the more interesting and layered character, caught between his father's crimes, his hatred for his father, yet still pushing to maintain the legacy and safety his family has built. If you removed the older Mulligan, the film would have remained pretty much the same which is a true waste of Duvall's talents. Kaluuya, who broke out in last years' Get Out was the biggest waste. His Jatemme was another character that could have either been amalgamated or cut completely. While the character had almost nothing to give a solid actor like Kaluuya, I even found the way he was played was too over-the-top villainous, throwing paraplegics from wheelchairs and killing without reason or remorse. There were several aspects of the cast I was excited about, yet ultimately disappointed with. I was excited about Bernthal and Coon, but they're barely in the film. Even Neeson has very limited screen time, his role mostly comprised of flashbacks. Debicki is another gifted actor whose character was not given enough time or development to give the actor a chance. I would dare say that with the exception of Davis (again) almost all of the characters were one-dimensional. Without Davis' Veronica, there is almost no one or nothing to latch onto in the story, (This may in fact be one of the downfalls of such a large ensemble and such an ambitious story). Luckily with Davis at the helm, steering this otherwise sinking ship, you can at least enjoy another powerful performance by this seasoned and award-winning actor. Veronica also represents the main point of the film, which is McQueen's focus on creating strong female characters. The Widows are in fact quite strong, one way or another, many of. I think with more time and a better rounded script, they could have all shown that. Sadly, once again, it seemed like the easy answer was to show physical prowess instead of inner strength or intellect; showing how fast Cynthia Erivo's Belle can run, showing Michelle Rodriguez's trademark Latina attitude, or showing Viola Davis' impressive musculature. Davis was the only character who on more than one occasion showed true inner strength and intellect, as she was not only capable of being Harry's equal in terms of planning and leading a heist, but perhaps even out-doing him. Yet that subtext falls flat in many of the other characters. McQueen and his co-writer Gillian Flynn constantly attempt to show strength in these women, but fall just short. They constantly try to convey other sub-textual elements like the class war, or the way men treat women, but again, fall short. They merely introduce concepts and perhaps give them one other small moment within the film, but I never found any theme truly woven throughout the story. The element that was the biggest disappointment to me wasn't McQueen's direction, it was Flynn's writing - I was enamored with Gone Girl (ironically also released in 2014) as I thought the development, the twists, and ironically again, the breadth of strong female characters was near perfect. For Flynn to be so near-perfect in her previous screenwriting endeavor, to create such intrigue, to masterfully reveal twists, and to develop the depth of character she did makes this endeavor that much more disappointing. Granted, she was adapting her own novel at the time, but she certainly has the writing talent and the tools available to have made Widows something special, or exhilarating, but instead it falls flat in every respect. The so-called twists especially were completely wasted. Mid way through the film, there is a major revelation that could have taken the story in so many different directions, and yet, once again, it went in the safest route possible. Everything about Widows whispered ""missed opportunity"" to me, and I call it a whisper because the experience of viewing it was akin to waiting quietly, patiently, but then ultimately realizing my expectations were never going to be fulfilled. While the film starts with some intrigue and excitement, it becomes more and more predictable. The conclusion has been seen several times before in one iteration or another, and especially after the conclusion, I realized there were several plot holes and that my suspension of disbelief for some of the cinematic convenience had been stretched too thin over too much time. You may think I'm simply being too overly critical (even for a guy who has a job title with 'critic' in it), but the fact is, there were reactions from my fellow audience members that were inexplicably inappropriate. There were several moments where I'm positive the scene was projected to be dramatic or sad, but some TIFF goers were laughing. That's a serious issue that goes past someone's terrible individual sense of humor, that's a failure of the director and the actors to convey the intended tone and emotion. You can't argue that a film like Widows, with its pedigree of direction, writing and one of the most impressive casts recruited is a Festival Film. Having seen the packed house at TIFF, you also can't argue that it will have thousands of fans clamoring to see it in theaters. What I can argue is whether it is the film it could have been. Flynn could have written a much tauter thriller. McQueen could have balanced the characters and pace of the film better. The actors could have tried to create more depth rather than surface level tropes. The potential with this group of artists far exceeds what was actually presented, but more importantly, so much of the movie has been done before. This goes beyond simply remaking a television show, but telling the story in a cinematic manner that is neither original nor inspired. I merely felt with all the talent this film had going in, what came out of it made Widows my most disappointing film at TIFF this year.",Widows

3) Directorial choices: Two moments that stood out were: 1) the intro to the characters, a well executed and well edited and sound designed sequence that cut back and forth between snipits of the women prior to becoming widows, juxtaposed with the violent heist gone wrong that eventually turned them into widows. 2) Another standout directorial moment is when Mcqueen chooses to show the journey from an impoverished predominantly black neighborhood to the wealthier part of town, all while two characters talk but are never seen. This was smart because it showcased the environment as a player in the story, and because the dialogue was mediocre at best, and actually showing the characters speaking would have felt melodramatic, expository, and uninteresting, but by shooting it in this way, it forced the viewer to listen less to the dialogue and focus more on the environment in which the event was taking place.Now for what DIDN'T work......
1) The Story: is not only formulaic and filled with predictable tropes, but everything that happens from beginning to end is at the expense of believability and truth. While Widows pitches itself as a heist movie, there's no set-up, build up, or pay off for the heist. There is simply no struggle. Because the script never gives us a plan of the heist, we don't follow the protagonists through the process of preparing to execute a plan that may/may not go as expected, instead we just see the widows running around and buying guns and vans but with no explanation of why and how they will carry out the deed; and thus, the viewer is unable to emotionally connect to the potential exciting/scary trials and tensions of a planned heist gone awry. One of my favorite things about heist movies is that the planning involved builds the viewer's expectations for the undertaking, so by experiencing the process with the protagonists we'd immediately feel for them and want them to succeed. However, in Widows there is no mention of a plan, or a near-impossible undertaking that will keep the viewer at the edge of his/her seat rooting for the characters, instead it's just a given that there is some sort of plan in place that already exists and that is never really talked about or explained, so when the heist is in full swing, it becomes a missed opportunity to have manipulated audience expectations and to take viewers on an emotional, tense filled and action packed journey. This also eliminates any sense of real/potential danger in the film which makes for two hours and nine minutes of very slow and uneventful boredom. There is no payoff at ALL. I attended the WGA screening of this movie (followed by Q&A with Steve McQueen and Gillian Flynn) and the screenwriters made sure to mention that they wanted the heist to be more ""small time,"" they didn't want the characters to steal $20 million dollars, but rather a smaller amount that would be divided among all of them. This comment felt more like an excuse for why Widows' stakes were so low, and less of a commentary on how wonderfully effective ""small time"" crime movies can be. In a good ""small-time crime"" film, the circumstances and stakes are so dire that stealing $10 could have really significant consequences, and the build up could make it very compelling (and sad) to watch someone risk everything for a small reward. Widows fails to deliver on any substantial set-up that could lead to either a great pay off, or sad/violent/disturbing disappointment. A missed opportunity for the writers to manipulate audience emotional connection to the story and its characters.
Another big issue with the film is that entire storylines are built up in Act I and then just dropped and unexplored by Acts II and III. An example of this is the story of Jamal Manning (played by Tyree Henry), who is painted as a crooked politician who serves as the catalyst/threat in the story that leads Veronica (Davis) to pursue this heist. However, while he does threaten her in Act I, Jamal's pursuit of this money falls by the wayside sometime in Act II, and Veronica's intention and reason for ""going on this heist journey"" (to pay back Jamal the money her husband stole, and to split the rest among the widows) never gets a resolution. She never has to face Jamal about the money, Jamal never comes back to claim the money, Jamal's entire storyline and intentions which seem to take center stage in Act I are barely mentioned or addressed by Act III. So the script sets up the audience expectations for really high stakes: If Veronica doesn't pay Jamal back the $2M then terrible things will happen to her (and to her dog?!?!) but then Jamal never comes back to collect on his threat, he never again inquire about the money that is owed to him, this storyline never really goes anywhere except on tangents and weak socio-political commentary.2) Character choices are unbelievable, relationships are poorly developed and intentions are weak and misleading. Secondary characters like that of Jatemme Manning (Daniel Kaluuya) are given center stage and built up in Act I, only to conveniently be killed off in easy and uninspired ways without struggle. Another major issue is the character of Harry Rawlins (Neeson). After his death, Harry leaves his wife a key, and a lock box combination, that sets Veronica on her journey. It is the set up that leads the viewers to believe that Harry loved his wife; so much so that after he's gone he wants her to have his most important possession - a special ""notebook"" that she can sell to the Mannings for a significant amount of money. So while in Act I, the story leads us to be believe Harry's intentions are to ""help his grieving wife,"" by Act III the story wants us to believe that now he's all of a sudden willing to kill Veronica for money (If Harry was willing to fake his own death and leave Veronica his most prized possession, then why all of a sudden is he willing to kill her for this money? Wouldn't it have been easier if he never would have left her the notebook to begin with? His intentions are so muddled and all over the place that it's difficult to take anything that happens seriously). Harry's actions feel imposed onto the story to create a false sense of drama, and to add shock value, all the while compromising the believability of the characters. A ridiculous twist happens in Act III that makes Veronica's relationship to her husband feel like it was a joke all along, one with zero history, and zero emotional depth which is a contradiction to how the writers set up their relationship in Act I. When we first learn of the love story between Veronica and Harry, we are led to believe the couple shared a profound, deep connection, a complicated romantic history, they even raised a child together, and experienced the shared trauma of losing that child, but nothing in the set up of their love story would lead any smart audience member to believe that these characters would so quickly try to kill each other without a second thought. Nothing up until this point in the story leads the viewer to believe that these to people don't care enough about one another to think twice before pulling the trigger. What's shocking is not that they are willing to kill each other, but that it's even happening in the first place. The motivations, intentions and actions are confusing and completely unbelievable.3) The film is filled with convenient plot points that account for missed opportunities for dramatic tension and struggle. For example, during the heist, the women's van is taken from them (it's not stolen, it's taken because stolen would imply a struggle, and there is no struggle). This could have been a fantastic opportunity for action. The protagonists had a plan, the plan went wrong, and now they have to fix it and get their van back? Watching them have to figure out a plan B would've been interesting, they would've had to struggle to figure out a solution, but instead the film cuts to them in another car chasing the van, and magically and conveniently Kaluuya's character hits a curb/wall, and dies instantly, allowing the women to simply just take their money back. There is no confrontation with Manning. So while the script attempted to give us a shocking twist (with Kaluuya taking the van from the widows immediately post heist) the women didn't have to fight very hard to win their van back. They're also never chased by cops (at any point), even though there are gunshots during the heist, even though they are robbing an affluent neighborhood that likely has surveillance cameras and security guards, even though they leave loose ends at the Mulligan house (Nurse could call the cops when her patient Tom Mulligan is killed) but no, there is no one after the widows. Any potential complications that could make the story more interesting are never explored. There is never a sense of fear, or urgency. During the heist, another obstacle presents itself that is quickly dismissed. This happens when the nurse (Robert Duvall's caretaker) comes out of the bedroom mid robbery, at which point the widows decide to let her go back to her bedroom. In a film more grounded in reality, when the stakes are supposedly so high, and these women are supposedly so desperate and reckless, when prison or death are at risk, and their children could be left without mothers, WHY would these women let the nurse go right back to bed after being discovered? Are they not afraid she will call the police? Are they not worried she'll wake everyone up and they'll be caught? Apparently NOT. And in an attempt to make this feel like a believable choice, one of the widows says ""do you think she'll call the police?"" and another widow says ""No that would be stupid"" what is so stupid about calling the police if you're being robbed? It's just a terrible story.",Widows
408,mstvincent,Potential to Be a Masterpiece,7,28 November 2018,"This film is from the director of ""12 Years A Slave"" so if you're expecting another masterpiece then you might be disappointed because this film was almost a masterpiece but unfortunately fell short. The film's payoff; the heist, went too quick and felt a little underwhelming despite the incredible musical score.A great cast w/ Viola Davis, Michele Rodriguez, Elizabeth Debicki, Cynthia Erivo, Colin Farrell, Robert Duvall, Brian Tyree Henry, Daniel Kaluuya and Liam Neeson. The actors all were absolutely incredible and I had hoped to see some acting related OSCAR nominations for this film but was seriously disappointed at The Academy's highly debatable decision. Viola Davis steals the show from all the female leads and gives a performance of raw emotion and desperation. Brian Tyree Henry is a very enjoyable actor to watch, giving a solid performance that is threatening while disguised as the calm before the story... the storm that is Daniel Kaluuya's character. Daniel Kaluuya is absolutely terrifying in his role and even w/ little words said his body language is some of the greatest since the era of German Expressionism. Colin Farrell had a surprising amount of screen time and it's very well deserved as his acting in this is as excellent as it was in ""Phonebooth"" (2002). For unavoidable spoiler reasons I will not go into detail about Liam Neeson's acting.Each shot gives a sense of uneasiness due to some good cinematography by Seam Bobbitt who has previously worked on the director's other films such as ""12 Years a Slave"" and ""Shame"". Each shot gives off a sense of tension even in scenes of calm. A lot of still shots add to the tension as you can only see what's there and are unable to move.The musical score was composed by the man who composes it all; Hans Zimmer. Hans Zimmer's music really builds tension and is absolutely nail biting. His music alone puts you on the edge of your set, yet alone having it accompany an already intense scene. His music as per usual doesn't need much say so all I will say is that nothing has changed w/ him because the music is great.This film has some very emotionally and physically strong female characters. These characters are layered and are very refreshing compared to two dimensional female characters from films like ""Resident Evil"" or ""Charlie's Angels"".While I do recommend this film I do not strongly recommend it like I do Steve McQueen's other film ""12 Years A Slave"". This film is a pretty good film but can be so much better.Final Rating: 7.3/10",Widows

424,beardsmore,"With strong political messages and a slow-burning plot, McQueen's heist thriller is deep, even if a tad underwhelming.",7,19 November 2018,"'Widows' was always going to be a film built on emotion, that much can be garnered from the title. But McQueen subverts this emotion into a heist thriller which encapsulates American society, fuelled by gender and race, and the result is powerful. The twist along the way keeps you guessing, and a standout performance from Daniel Kaluuya as the remorseless antagonist always just a few steps behind is chilling. Protagonists Davis, Debicki (whose character I found particularly intriguing), Rodriguez and Erivo all provide excellent performances, a common desire for success mixed with clashing personalities fuels the atmospheric tension that is present almost throughout. The scenes in which the film feels both the longest and the most tedious is the political ones. There is a strong political undercurrent and a lot of scenes of dialogue which never seem to get anywhere. As a result of scenes like this I found myself internally debating whether or not this film had run longer than the 2h 9m time the internet had given. As good as the heist is in the film's third act, it all seems over a little too quickly and is therefore underwhelming. Yes there is tension and high stakes, but a few extra minutes are needed in order for the pay off to really feel worth it. It is a shame that the ending feels so rushed when the middle felt so long. However, When all is said and done, these women prove they more than have what it takes, and McQueen leaves the audience with a lot to think about when the screen goes black.",Widows

I didn't give a toss about any of the many characters and by the time the film trundled on extremely slowly towards the final act (to the point where something actually happened), I'd already lost all interest.

I can't remember the last time I've wanted to quit partway through a movie so many times - I've got a serious completion complex, but it still took some serious willpower to not turn it off. As others have mentioned, there are simply no likeable or sympathetic characters in this movie. On top of that, it seemed overly and pointlessly violent at times - some of it just plain disturbing and sickening to me. The only reason I'm not giving it the lowest rating of one star is to give some credit to the very competent actors. Overall, though, I simply wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone.",Widows

478,susicutler-09776,Poorly crafted with a few neat shots and solid acting.,4,5 December 2018,"Steve McQueen's film tries to do too much and ultimately fails. The plot felt contrived at points and took way too long to get to the general bad-assery that we all came to this movie to see. The story was choppy, often alternating between leaving the audience to assume too much or spoon-feeding the audience, rarely striking the perfect balance that the movie needed.Characters were poorly dealt with, starting with the problem that twice as many characters existed as were needed. When subtlety and complexity were attempted, it was generally carried out only to the point where the characterization felt inconsistent.The score was fine, nothing more. It seems that the only person who can get good work out of Zimmer anymore is Christopher Nolan.The strengths of this movie lie in the actresses, particularly Elizabeth Debicki, who excelled as the most complex and interesting character. Of note, her American accent is superb, especially when contrasted with that of Colin Pharrell, who fought his Irish accent throughout the film.Overall, the movie felt heavy handed and poorly crafted.

One wonders how a studio drops millions on a script that hasn't been reviewed by storytelling experts. It would be even faster to have experts write the script to begin with. If you know how a story is designed, this movie will be painful to watch. One reviewer mentioned deeper layers of meaning, implicating that as a reason for negative reviews (you just didn't GET it!). It would be more accurate to say that no one missed anything. The story simply lacked a proper design, which means it lacked what the audience expects and longs to see when they go to the movies. One reviewer stated the story had no cliches. Please look up the definition of cliches. You'll find the story was stuffed with them. A good storyteller could have made vast improvements on this bad script.

But the film ends up leaving me quite confused with the necessity of a few seemingly important plot points which in the end stall the narrative in a way. It feels like the screenplay from Flynn and McQueen is much bigger than the film we've seen, but the product is pretty underdeveloped. I understand some people would have problems with the story, misogynistic because the characters are poorly developed in the 130 minutes. I do think the story is a classic Flynn thriller with more humanity and feminity, very intriguing too. It has much more potential as a TV series, something like Big Little Lies, just more space and time to go in depth with every detail.",Widows

How and why the last women joined in for the 'job' was not comprehensible, which means the plot didn't work here.

534,willmullins-09704,"A few good moments, but overall Widows falls flat",4,23 April 2019,"The film starts by cutting between a car chase after a heist gone wrong and flashbacks of each heist members relationship. This fast paced editing helps build excitement and is an excellent way to introduce the viewer to our main characters. Unfortunately this frenetic pace is then held for the next hour as more characters, each with their own sub-plots, are introduced.Each of these characters does have their moments, whether it be shocking, funny or just bad-ass. But these moments pale in comparison to the mistakes this movie contains. The plot becomes overly intricate and convoluted quickly and although each characters motivations are laid out at first they are somewhat lost as the film progresses.So much is crammed into the two hours there is no room for any of it to breathe. In fact I'm sure if half the characters were simply cut out instead of half-baked the film would be a hell of a lot better. So few of the character arcs are ended satisfactorily, or at all, and the themes feel disjointed.There are certainly redeeming scenes and moments, but I was left scratching my head far too many times to enjoy the experience overall.",Widows

However, this was thrown together as if it was at the last minute to get this movie done before the end of the year? Also, I sat in my seat uncomfortable due to the long movie which should have been edited better by a professional individual in this field. Script needed more character development. Sorry but the good acting doesn't save this film. I'm all for good script in a movie and this doesn't cut it for me. I question whether I will see further movies from this director or producer. Don't like his style - passion is one thing but learning the craft to complete a good project is necessary - take a look at Billy Wilder - ""The Best Years Of Our Lives"" or Hitchcock - in ""Rear Window"" even the movie which I love ""Fences"" first done on Broadway then into a movie by Denzel Washington.

But the women's characters were not at all fleshed out. There were many plot holes in the movie. It was often bleak and tedious and usually totally unrealistic. The dialogue read like an outline for a script; Very unnatural and forced. I was hoping this would either be a heavy, interesting, realistic film, or a fun, somewhat unrealistic, but fun heist film. It was trying to be a sprawling political film, about political corruption, a gangster film, and a feminist lady-heist film, and ended up making little sense and being joyless and unrealistic.

544,Abjohnson-228-581020,"I needed rubber gloves, handling hazardous material",5,17 November 2018,"Do know that I had to put on my rubber gloves before writing this review. What's with the frown? One should always wear proper protection when dealing with hazardous material. Widows is everything that I had hoped that it would not be, but I should have known better. Director Steve McQueen is at the helm and I still have PTSD from 12 Years a Slave. A group of professional thieves led by Harry Rawlings (Liam Neeson) are killed attempting to steal from a local criminal kingpin who in turn assigns the debt to Rawlings' widow (Viola Davis). Davis' character quickly realizes she needs help and figures it's only fair that the other dead crooks wives help her in pulling off a large enough job to repay the debt. Imagine if all the significant others of the robbers from the 1995 film Heat decided to plan a heist. They have zero experience in high stakes theft but that's totally okay because it's a movie and you can do anything. Right....One of the critical issues with this film is that it has too many incomplete subplots that ultimately end up nowhere. It's as though McQueen wanted to address a lot of current issues Americans are facing, the most glaring being the tension of race relations between blacks and whites. He also dabbles in the hustle game of politics, the division of church and state, father-son relationships, police brutality, feminism, nepotism, sexism, and pick a couple of other -isms because they're probably also in the film. I understand it can be tempting when you have such a huge platform and there's so much to talk about but it's a trap. All you end up with is a Cheesecake Factory menu of random stuff and all of it is average at best and none quite getting the proper attention it deserves. McQueen would have been better served staying on the task at hand and waterproofing the main plot.The cast is anchored by the talented Viola Davis but even her tears and runny nose are unable to save this film. I was not very impressed by any of the veteran actor's performance in the film. All appeared subpar of what we've grown to expect from Davis, Neeson, Robert Duvall, and Colin Farrell. Duvall and Farrell play father and son whose family has run an area of Chicago for many years and Duvall's character is struggling with the passing of the torch. Both great actors but too often I was on the set listening to actors deliver lines. The conversations were artificial and cliché'.Brian Tyree Henry (FX's Atlanta) is the kingpin who is tired of the dangers of the street life and has decided to go into something equally as crooked (politics) but a lot safer and wants to trade in his gun for a microphone to take advantage of city contracts with kickbacks. Henry has the best performance, but it was like saying he's the ""tallest midget"" in this one. That's not politically correct, I'm sorry. Get Out's Daniel Kaluuya is Henry's little brother and chief henchman. He's gets an A- for effort but is miscast. The old ""being dark-skinned makes your character look tough"" in the film doesn't work. That character stereotype faded in the early '90s and I struggled to accept Kaluuya as a stone-cold killer.I wish I could sit McQueen down for an episode of ""Fix My Film"" and in my raspy Iyanla Vanzant voice, start the conversation with ""my beloved, how did you get here?"" Hey, I can dream, instead I will remain relegated to these words and bring you nothing but the real on the reel. Save this one for RedBox, I give this film an 5/10.",Widows

The story is really slow and the actual heist happened 5 min at the end of the movie. The plot twist was also terrible and the ending was even more ridiculous.

The film is incredibly slow with random scenes that do not add anything to the main plot. Some scenes could have been entirely cut and the plot wouldn't have been effected at all. It took me about half an hour before I realised the film was set in America and not in England as there some dodgy accents throughout.. especially from Colin Farrell...
The story had been changed slightly from the original, which would have been fine if it was a good change. Acting from the widows is fine. However, Liam Neeson still plays the same character regardless of what film he's in.

568,lilmatt028,One of the Top Ten Films of 2018,10,26 November 2018,"Steve McQueen is a genius and this film left me utterly speechless. It helps that Gillian Flynn cowrote the screenplay so you know you are in for a mind-twisting treat. This is one of the best heist films I have seen in the last couple of years! Ocean's 8 wishes it could be this film! The sole reason I wanted to see this was to witness Viola Davis's performance but overall all the women like Michelle Rodriguez, Cynthia Erivo, and Elizabeth Debicki gave astonishing performances. Daniel Kaluuya was terrifying on screen and I would not be surprised if he snatches an Oscar Nomination for Best Supporting Actor.The message that McQueen sets out with this film particularly filming it in Chicago is not a coincidence at all and the true motives for our characters were delicious and heartbreaking. A couple of times I found myself with my mouth wide open and shocked at how this story unravels. The best way of storytelling is when you leave the audience at the edge of their seat not knowing whats going to happen next. I entered this film with low expectations and is definitely one of my top 5 films of the year. I would not be surprised come Oscar season that this racks up major nominations across the board.I love the cinematography and McQueen skills as a director is powerful and smooth. I cannot begin to comprehend how difficult it was making this film and yet he made it look effortless on camera. I need to re-watch this film a good 10 times to get it out of my system and so worth it to seeing it on the big screen!! Please go watch this film!!",Widows
569,greek-14,Kind of weird,5,30 November 2018,"Found myself being pulled out of the spell of the film several times to wonder what I just saw. Some examples:1) Overly kissy in the first scene to the point where you're like, COMMON NOW!2) Long scene where they just do nothing for long sets, being sad or something emotional.3) Going to that architect's house... I mean, what did I just see here?4) Taking forever to get there, reminds me of 70's movies where you'd watch someone smoke the entire cigarette.Many scenes seemed to have no meaning or tie-in to the film. This isn't apparent until the end of the film where you're left wondering why.1) The blond develops this ""relationship"" with a paying customer. We have several scenes with him. Ultimately that goes nowhere.2) Where did the 2nd getaway car come from? I mean, they got it in like 30 seconds flat. I assume they carjacked it, but we're left to wonder.3) Who actually shot the old geezer? I have my ideas, but it's confusing and I think rather important.Then there's the completely unrealistic stuff that even naive people know doesn't pass the smell test.1) you can't just give people piles of undocumented cash to build new library2) you need to ""wash"" the money (aka The Ozarks) and that you'd be noticed pretty quickly spreading all that cash around.There were other disturbing scenes, like the violence of the henchman for the crime lord. I think they are trying to paint him as a psycho, but it's off-putting. I wanted to enjoy this movie. I can ignore a lot of plot holes and bad acting or writing if the action and stunts are awesome. This movie didn't really have that. So I was left to my inner dialogue asking all these questions.I think this movie was made to please the Academy and win an Oscar. I have a $5 bet that it'll be nominated for at least one category.It's not a terrible movie, but it's about 30 mins longer then it needs to be and you'll probably be wondering what they were thinking with some of these scenes.P.S. they really missed an opportunity for Liam Neeson to do some badass stuff.

This is revealed by how inaccurately they seem to intuit and understand other people's minds. And that was revealed in the characters' largely off-the-mark and illogical behavior, not to mention a moonscape of plot holes. The chess pieces -- I mean characters -- were moved around the board in random patterns, just because. Large swaths of the story seemed invented on-the-spot with little thought as to whether the characters and scenes held together in logical storytelling form. Whatever little bits of scenes seemed at all real, we've seen before. And besides, a story is supposed to entertain; so blood, guns, a sex scene here and there, car crashes, and swearing do not entertainment make.But I gave it another star for the actors, who would have been better served had the director simply remade the original series word-for-word.",Widows

It seems everybody was expecting a heist movie a la Oceans 11, and instead got a Steve McQueen movie. Well, for all of you who're craving for some action fast-paced exciting scenes that only happen in the movies... You can have Ocean's Eight. Not a bad movie, thought. Don't forget the xanax before bed.",Widows
601,nickbolton-63999,"Poor plot, open loops and ultimately pointless",3,9 November 2018,"Going against the grain of all the positive reviews, I found this a very unsatisfying and silly drama. The plot is incoherent and so many story lines are left undeveloped and, essentially, irrelevant. Key plot lines make no sense at all from the macro plot to the micro details that don't stack up and serve only to undermine it. I suspect the very same film from a less regarded director would be slammed but we become hyptonised to assume there must be something important and worthy going on here.With so many plot lines this would make a great Netflix series but as a film it is very poor.Only the acting redeems it.",Widows

603,simba-80927,One of the best films I've seen this year.,10,13 November 2018,"Thrilling film with some of the most interesting and contrasting characters I've seen on the big screen for a long time. The film editing and camera work should also be noted. Many of the film's main scenes are constructed around the soundtrack; the sound design is used as a way of not only dramatizing a scene and describing the characters, but also directing the pace and style of the picture editing. A truly cinematic experience.",Widows
604,philatmatch,A movie that tries to be many things and fails.,5,15 November 2018,"I'm amazed at the rave reviews. Too many serious flaws. A big budget , great cast let down by a poor scenario and script. A 'caper movie' where these previously law abiding and moral women arm up for an armed robbery, overpower an armed guard and murder an old man with no moral compunction. American Animals was somewhat more realistic about the impact of such behaviour. This was a mash up of various bits of other movies clumsily put together , and seeking self consciously to be taken seriously, despite the comic cuts ... upside down safe combination Really!!! ...gun buying was hilarious. ... coincidences and convenient happenings .... alongside brutal torture and violence. It was for me greatly unsettling in the cynicism of the industry that produced this.",Widows
605,abaluodufa,CREATED AN ACCOUNT TO TELL YOU NOT TO WASTE YOUR MONEY AND TIME,1,21 November 2018,"It falls flat.First of all, we are not endeared to the thieves to miss them when they are blown up. We just see them flashing on and off the screen before they die.It's good acting from Viola Davis but then it makes absolutely no sense that her her husband will turn the opposite way and do her bad like that. The acting could not even justify this.So many unanswered questions: did they pay Jamal his money seeing as this was such a central subject?
Is Jamal still looking for the book?-another subject that a big fuss was made about, I mean they killed someone and injured the wheelchair guy because of this Almighty book!
Will he avenge Kulaya's death, after all he can trace it back to them easily?
How did the nurse not call the police after seeing them? etc etcIn all these movie fell flat. The trailer is better than the movie.At the end I was like ""Is that it???""",Widows

607,loribean-33637,so bad in so many ways,1,24 November 2018,"I can't believe so many people thought this was even a decent film. It was so slow to take off, it had no space in it at all, it was way too violent which was not necessary (shock does not add value in my book) and it was downright silly at times. I could not keep track of all of the story lines they tried to develop. I think it had potential, but they needed to take half of the fluff out, develop the characters that mattered, open it up a bit and give it some room to breath, and take the disturbing useless violence out. Lots of people walked out. Terrible and a total shocker that anyone could actually say it was any good at all!",Widows
608,edrisahmadi-92981,Had a great nap!,1,24 November 2018,Most boring 'action movie'. Had a nice nap though..,Widows
609,MCCLUV,How to get away with murdering a widow....,3,26 November 2018,119 minutes of character development and what seems like 10 minutes of total action you see in the previews. It emphasizes getting you to familiar with characters so much so you lose interest with the plot. Felt like it builds you up just for nothing to happen and by the time it does you already had anticipated it. Lots of scenes of Viola Davis walking into the frame around walls and planning the heist.,Widows
610,netraam-94404,A mess,1,9 December 2018,"Too many unnecessary characters. Way too many side plots which add nothing to the story and do not get solved. A build up of nearly two hours to a completely underwhelming heist. So many unrealistic and unbelievable events. So many completely illogical things.After veronica finds out her husband is still alive, why does she still go trough with the plan instead of getting revenge over him? Why are we shown so many shots that prove veronica has an intimate relationship with her husband, but in the end he screws her over with no proble and they try to kill each other as if they don't mean anything? Who is the guy who gets money to build a library in the end? Why doesn't she build the library herself? Why do they go trough all this trouble to do the heist when they could just kill manning and his guys? Why do the other two women even agree to do the heist? Who is the blonde girl and why does she agree to get involved? Who is the girl in the barbershop? What is her story? What's up with the guy in the bowling alley?This movie raises enough questions to fill a whole season of a television series, but in the end almost none of them are answered. Also it tries way too hard to bring emotional scenes into the story without first laying the foundation for this by having the audiance build a connection to the characters. At the ending some people in the cinema were laughing at how contrived and unbelievable it was. The only interesting scene is the one where they ride from the hood to a nice neighbourhood and you only see the reflections in the car window.",Widows

613,ginoperotti,An amazing cast,9,10 March 2019,"A thriller with brilliant performances that will have you on the edge of your seat. An original and slightly different take on a heist film. And lets face it the heist genre has been done again and again so it's refreshing to see one that isn't just a rehash of Oceans 11. The chemistry between the women is what made this for me, along with the character development.",Widows
