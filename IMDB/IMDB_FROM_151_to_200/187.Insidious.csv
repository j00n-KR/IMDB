0,TheLittleSongbird,Insidious haunting,7,16 October 2018,"It took me a while to watch 'Insidious' and its follow ups, with so much going on with my studies and commitments and with an ever growing watch and review list. Decided to finally watch them all, with the intent of reviewing the latest film as part of my quest to see as many 2018 films as possible and wanting to see how it compared with the previous outings. Also with an appreciation, if not quite undying love, for horror.Having seen 'Insidious', it is not a horror classic, or at least to me it isn't, and it is understandable as to why people don't like it. Especially if over-familiarity, strangeness and silliness are not for you. Personally, 'Insidious' was, warts and all, worth the too-overdue wait, and it is not hard to see why it has appealed to others. There are a lot of merits executed very well. For one thing, 'Insidious' llooks great, especially for horror films released in recent years (too many of which have looked like they were made on the schlocky cheap). It looks slick and stylish while having a spooky setting and suitably nightmarish lighting. The music, when used, is haunting and not over-bearing, recorded in a way that is not overly loud or obvious that it spoils the atmosphere (which was great because many horror films seen recently failed in this regard).Script is not too awkward and is structured coherently, with nothing cheapening it like sluggish exposition or cheesy misplaced humour. The direction is meticulous in detail and clearly shows an engagement and ease with the material. The story takes time to unfold but doesn't get dull, actually really admired the restraint of the first half, meaning that the film started off incredibly well. 'Insidious' is genuinely scary with a great atmosphere, with actual tension, suspense and dread, in a palm-sweating and heart-pounding sense at its best, while not relying too much on jump scares (they are there but have build up and were surprising).Also liked the characters more than expected. The leads were ones worth caring for, didn't get frustrated with them, wish for more personality or annoyed by them. The ghosts may be overused but have eerie presences and didn't look that cheap to me. The direction is assured and the performances are strong from particularly an intense Lin Shaye and Patrick Wilson handling his character growth believably. Rose Byrne is also as professional as ever. On the other hand, the restraint does decrease later on and things get a little too over-the-top in some of the second half, very unsubtle over-stuffed kitchen-sink-like. Things do get silly at this point too and less logical, making the sense go out the window. The second half is still intriguing and creepy, the film just worked much better when restrained.It has been said that 'Insidious' is derivative. Definitely agree with this, the over-familiarity from running through as many modern-haunted-house clichés as can muster and having parts similar to other horror films is all over the film and makes one wish there was more freshness. Will admit that the final twist is a shock, but instead of being unnerving of ingenious it came over as out of kilter wacky and not easy to take at face value. The whole ending in fact felt rushed. Summing up, enjoyable and effective but the divisiveness is understandable. 7/10 Bethany Cox",Insidious
1,Leofwine_draca,"Starts well, but soon turns into a pantomime",5,10 January 2013,"INSIDIOUS is yet another one of those Hollywood ghost stories involving a possessed child. It follows a predictable format, with minor, isolated incidents gradually giving way to larger-scale, more pronounced apparitions and events before culminating in a full-scale onslaught of evil. And it's all rather silly.I enjoyed the first half of the movie. It's here where things are kept subtle and straightforward, with effectively creepy scare scenes and half-glimpsed figures spotted lurking in darkened rooms. So far, so good. But around the halfway mark, the film introduces a trio of paranormal investigators and things quickly descent into POLTERGEIST-style farce.The problem with depictions of a hellish limbo or netherworld is that, in order to make something scary, you have to pretty much identify with the different fears of each viewer. Sorry, but I don't find tussles with greasy-looking hobos and Darth Maul from THE PHANTOM MENACE to be particularly frightening; in fact, there's something pantomime about the whole thing.The actors, including the dependable Rose Byrne and Patrick Wilson, do their best but at times in the latter stages they seem to struggle to keep a straight face while the ludicrous events increase in scale and speed. It's a shame that the whole thing goes to pot, because if it had been handled more sensitively (and with less sensationalism) by the team behind the SAW franchise then it could well have worked much better.",Insidious
2,SnoopyStyle,Good old fashion horror,7,24 May 2014,The Lambert family has moved into a house with a dark spirit lurking within. Josh (Patrick Wilson) and Renai (Rose Byrne) have 3 kids. Their boy Dalton has an accident falling through a ladder in the attic. He hits his head and falls into a mysterious coma overnight. Three months later and he is back home but still in a coma. There are strange voices over the baby monitor. The younger boy Foster is scared of Dalton walking around late at night. Strange things keep happening. They move but the haunting follows them to the new house. Grandma Lorraine Lambert (Barbara Hershey) brings in Specs and Tucker and Elise to find the cause.This is a nice solid little horror using all the classic haunted house effects and possession/ghost story elements. It is a lot of old school filmmaking from horror specialist director James Wan. The performance are all solid anchored by Rose Byrne who plays a compelling young mother. The characters are certainly real enough that I didn't ask why they don't just move. These people actually moved. This is good old fashion horror.,Insidious
3,Horst_In_Translation,The good outweighs the bad,6,29 March 2016,"""Insidious"" is an American 110-minute movie from 6 years ago. It was fairly successful in terms of awards, box office and critics, so that it should not come as a surprise that several sequels have been made already. The director is James Wan (""Saw"") and the writer is his longtime collaborator Leigh Whannell. I personally thought this film had ups and downs. I am a fan of horror films that have an unknown danger attached to them (like the Blair Witch) and this one does as well, which I liked. After a supernatural encounter at the attic, a boy falls into a coma and the rest of the film is about the parents trying to find out how to help him, all in the process of dealing with more and more supernatural forces coming to the house where they live in.What I did not like about the film was the sound work. Good sound effects are crucial for a film in carrying a story as well as elevating the material sometimes. But here it is the opposite. Obviously the sound technicians wanted to make sure they get recognized as the volume is so over the top compared to the people talking. Some audience members may like it, but for me it does not elevate the scare factor, but just becomes really annoying. Apart from that, the sequence with the dad in the parallel world was not really necessary and I did not find it as memorable as others perhaps. All in all, Wan and the cast made a good job by channeling aspects and performances that have worked well in horror in the past and even if they brought nothing really new to the genre, they still did a decent job. I would not say that (despite the cliffhanger ending) I am too curious about the sequels, but this first film is worth watching. I recommend it.",Insidious
4,claudio_carvalho,Finally a Great Horror Movie,10,13 August 2011,"The teacher Josh Lambert (Patrick Wilson) and his wife Renai (Rose Byrne) move with their three children, the boys Dalton (Ty Simpkins) and Foster (Andrew Astor) and the baby Cali, to a big house. When Dalton is exploring the attic, he falls from the ladder and hits the head on the floor. On the next morning, Dalton does not wake up and stays in coma, but the doctors are not able to diagnose his problem. Three months later, weird things happen in the house and Renai sees apparitions. She is sure that the house is haunted and convinces Josh to move to another house. Sooner Renai sees ghosts in the new house and Josh does not believe in his wife. But his mother Lorraine (Barbara Hershey) tells him that she had also had a vision of a fiend in Dalton's room. They invite the medium and Lorraine's old friend Elise Rainier (Lin Shaye), who brings her team of ghost hunters Specs (Leigh Whannell) and Tucker (Angus Sampson) to investigate the supernatural phenomenon. Elise explains that Dalton is a traveler with the ability of leaving his physical body and travel in astral projection. Now his spiritual body is lost in a place called Further that is not for the living and entities are gathered trying to get inside his empty physical body. Among these entities there is a demon that needs Dalton's body to cause pain to the others. Further, Lorraine discloses that Josh is also a gifted traveler and must seek out Dalton in Further and bring him back. ""Insidous"" is a great horror movie with a spooky supernatural story without gore that is scarier than any slasher. The screenplay is well written and the film has good performances. The cinematography, the edition, make-up and special effects give a frightening atmosphere of nightmare. The surprising conclusion ends with golden key this film. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Sobrenatural"" (""Supernatural"")Obs: I bought the Blu-Ray and today (20 Oct 2012) I have just seen it again. ""Insidious"" is the scariest film that I have seen from 13 August 2011 until today. I found it better than the first time and I also changed my vote to ten.",Insidious
5,kosmasp,Classic Horror ... with a twist,7,5 June 2014,"Obviously this is trying to emulate and recreate things that have worked in the past and is very ""oldschool"" in its approach. But not the whole way through, because towards the end, this does take a bit of an unexpected turn. I think it does so successfully, but there are quite a few out there who would disagree.So while there are movies out there, where you can decide after a couple of minutes what you think of a movie and if you should continue watching, this might either surprise you badly towards the end or actually make you think, that it is better than you though to begin with. Horror (especially one without much blood or violence) does rely on scares ... this has a few very good ones",Insidious
6,classicsoncall,"""How did the voice of reason become the bad guy here?""",7,9 July 2012,"In checking the user ratings for this film, I'm finding that my initial suspicions about younger viewers hailing this film as one of the 'scariest of all time' to be based on age. I'm over sixty, and I saw ""The Exorcist"" during it's original release in 1973. Let me tell you, that was one scary flick. My son, who's thirty five thought this film was right up there in the fright department, but I wound up pretty much ho-humming my way through the entire thing. So my theory here is that one's susceptibility to being manipulated by a film's gimmicks decreases with age.There are other things working against the film as well. For one, the tone and mood of the set up was filmed too colorfully for a horror film. Virtually all of the scenes occurred during daylight hours, so any attempt at suspense was dissipated by lack of atmosphere. There were a couple of well placed cryptic elements like the misplaced box of sheet music and the bloody hand print, but their impact seemed negligible in the larger scheme of things.When the theme turned to astral projection and out of body experience, I felt I was watching one of those Sci-Fi cable channel documentaries, thereby relegating the story to a ghost hunters exercise rather than a horror flick. Turning the principal disbeliever (Patrick Wilson as Josh Lambert) into an active participant in the demon hunt seemed sort of contrived, and the disturbing finale was a little too late to save the picture over all. Inattentive viewers might miss the nuance of the final minutes of the story; for me that was one of the few hooks that forced me to think about what had happened.One interesting observation as I discussed this film with my son was his reaction to the background music provided by Tiny Tim with his version of 'Tiptoe Through the Tulips'. When Herbert Khaury recorded that song it was nothing more than a novelty tune done in falsetto that made Top 40 in most markets. Because of it's use in the picture, my son thought it was a truly creepy song and couldn't reconcile himself to my description of it's origin. For my part, I tried to see it his way and in a way I guess he could have been right, but then I'd picture Tiny Tim and the whole thing fell apart.Followers of 'out of body' science will probably find the ideas explored here to be presented well enough to validate some of their own ideas about the concept. For myself, I thought the depiction of the demon was rather well done, but it was too little too late to make the picture truly horrifying. The effectiveness of the ending will probably be lost on most viewers as well, unless you take the time to rewind the last couple of minutes like I did trying to make sense of what happened and who or what made it out of The Further.",Insidious
7,gavin6942,Solid Work From the Saw Boys,7,12 July 2011,"A family looks to prevent evil spirits from trapping their comatose child (Ty Simpkins) in a realm called The Further.This film is marketed as being from the creators of ""Paranormal Activity"", which makes sense given the subject matter -- but this is really the brainchild of the ""Saw"" boys -- being directed by James Wan and written by Leigh Whannell (who also appears as a character). For an added bonus, horror veteran Lin Shaye is here in one of her best roles.This film is legitimately creepy. I am not big on ""jump"" or ""bus"" scares, and even less of a fan of computer animation, but this film just impressed me. There were so many shots that made it worthwhile, with quick flashes of a shadowy figure -- just enough to get the imagination to conjure up something more. The best balance for horror is the use of the seen and the unseen in a certain mixture -- not sure precisely how much, but the makers of this film clearly do. I think ""Insidious"" was overlooked by many and that is just a shame.The advertising consistently used quotes from reviews to insist this film is the best thing since either ""Poltergeist"" or ""Exorcist"". I assume anyone who reads that thinks it's an exaggeration. But do not think it exaggerates too much -- these are not just cherry-picked quotes. While putting ""Insidious"" in the same league as either of those two films is hard to do, it is not far behind... in fact, I would not even mind saying it gives ""Poltergeist"" a run for its money...While I hope ""Insidious"" does not turn into a franchise (we are all a little burned out on ""Saw"", ""Paranormal Activity"" and ""The Collector""), as it stands, this film is a winner. It takes the haunting subgenre of horror and completely turns it on its head... for the better.",Insidious
8,jboothmillard,Insidious,6,6 May 2011,"At the time I saw this it was number one in the American box office chart and it was billed as one of the scariest movies ever, and being from the makers of Saw and Paranormal Activity I was keen to try it, from director James Wan (Saw). Basically the Lambert family, Josh (Patrick Wilson) and Renai (Rose Byrne) and their three children are settling into their new home they've moved into. Their son Dalton (Ty Simpkins) one night hears noises in the attic and goes eight year old to investigate, and he climbs a ladder which has one step step and cause him to fall, and the next morning he has fallen into a mysterious coma. Three months pass and he is still in a coma that the doctor says wasn't caused by the fall, and over the next few days paranormal events occur in the house, Renai seeing and hearing scary things, including a bloody hand print in Dalton's bed and dark figures. Josh agrees that if she is so worried the house is haunted they can move house, however the new house makes no difference as the dark forces have followed them to their location. Therefore Renai has a talk with Josh's mother Lorraine (Black Swan's Barbara Hershey) who refers her to paranormal activity expert Elise Rainier (Lin Shaye) who agrees to see them about the fearful goings on. Along with her team, Specs (Saw's Leigh Whannell, also writing) and Tucker (Angus Sampson), and she does confirm that they are being tormented by evil forces, but it is not the house that is haunted, it is Dalton. Because he has the ability to have his soul walk around out of his body, and the coma status has forced him into another dimension guarded by the evil, and there are nasty entities trying to take over his body, but the nearest is a black figure with a red face of fire. With Renai and Josh's agreement they begin a form of exorcism to get rid of the spirits and try to make way for Dalton to come back to the real world, there is a little bit of progress made. Elise tells Josh that he also has the same ability to transport his soul out of his body like Dalton, explained from photo evidence with him as a child and a dark figure getting closer to him, she says the only way to get him back is to enter the demon's world, ""the further"", without being noticed by the other spirits. Eventually after the near doom Josh does manage to get Dalton out of the spirit world and they both return to their bodies, Renai is relieved to have them both back. In the end we see them slowly going back to normal, and we see Josh really lose it with Elise when she takes a photo of him, he kills her after she sees an evil figure, and the horrible ending is not happy with Renai discovering evil is still present, and we don't know what happens next. Also starring Andrew Astor as Foster Lambert, Heather Tocquigny as Nurse Kelly and Ruben Pla as Dr. Sercarz. I can see the comparison to Paranormal Activity and Poltergeist, and there are elements of a few other haunted house films (even though it's not technically the house), but I genuinely found it scary, I jumped at least five times (even some bits I knew I would I did), I admit some shock value does not work the second time watching, but it is still a really worthwhile scary supernatural horror thriller. Good!",Insidious
9,Tweekums,An effective chiller,7,17 December 2018,"This chiller opens as Josh and Renai Lambert move into their new house with young sons Dalton and Foster, and Cali, their baby daughter. Shortly afterwards Dalton falls in the attic; he doesn't appear badly hurt but the next day he doesn't wake up. He appears to be in a coma but the doctors can't identify the reason. His condition doesn't change and three months later he returns home to be looked after there. Soon afterwards Renai starts hearing noises and then seeing things. Convinced the house is haunted they move to a new house; the occurrences don't stop; in fact they get worse leading to the Lamberts calling in to professionals.When I watched this I expected it to be really scary as it had been recommended by a friend who is into horror films... I didn't find it quite as scary as I hoped but it had effective moments and a good creepy atmosphere. The setup is impressive as it nicely suggests that we are in for a haunted house film before changing tack and giving us the real reason. While this definitely isn't a comedy-horror there are a few good laughs that lighten the tone... just before it darkens again. The cast is solid; Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne impress as the Lamberts and Lin Shaye is equally impressive as expert as Elise Rainier. Overall I'd say if you want gore this will disappoint but if you prefer creepy/menacing horror like 'Poltergeist' or the more recent 'The Babadook' then I'd definitely recommend this.",Insidious

11,BA_Harrison,Polternormal Activigeist.,7,23 July 2011,"Seen Poltergeist and Paranormal Activity? If so, then you'll be in very familiar territory with James Wan's Insidious, which borrows heavily from both of these supernatural blockbusters, but thankfully does so with just enough verve to still make it a satisfying experience.As in Poltergeist, Wan's film centres around a suburban family—Josh and Renai Lambert (Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne) and their three kids—who experience supernatural activity shortly after moving into their new home. At first the occurrences are fairly innocuous—strange noises and moving objects—but after eldest son Dalton (Ty Simpkins) mysteriously lapses into a coma-like state, the incidents begin to escalate in severity and scariness.Just like Paranormal Activity, even moving house doesn't prevent the creepiness from continuing, leaving Josh and Renai no option but to turn to a team of experts (led by the always delightful Lin Shaye), who discover that it is Dalton himself who is being haunted—by a hideous demon intent on occupying the boy's body.Although Insidious certainly won't win any awards for originality, it successfully does what it sets out do do: frighten the audience silly for an hour and a half with plenty of well executed jump scares and lots of fun freakiness (watch it and just try and tell me you weren't weirded out by the sight of that little kid gyrating to Tiny Tim's 'Tiptoe Through The Tulips'—mind you, the song on it's own is enough to make my skin crawl!).",Insidious
12,moonspinner55,Thing That Go Bump in the Attic 101,3,17 July 2017,"Despite the fact all his vital signs are normal, a little boy has lapsed into a comatose state after encountering something in the attic of his parents' new home. Handsomely-made ghost story with some shudders, though director James Wan and screenwriter Leigh Whannell keep the audience on edge by mechanical means: loud noises, door slams, an earsplitting security alarm and an incessantly crying baby. The only aural effect that shows any ingenuity is a '60s recording of Tiny Tim singing ""Tiptoe Through the Tulips"" (which is scary all by itself). The family at the center of this thriller are cookie-cutter dull, while the plot developments are derivative and carried out listlessly. Followed by a sequel in 2013 and a prequel in 2015...and one fears there's more to come. *1/2 from ****",Insidious
13,paul_haakonsen,Everyone said it was oh-so-scary...,4,13 June 2011,"Okay, well I had heard nothing but praise for ""Insidious"" and that it was the scariest movie of 2011 so far. So naturally I gave the movie a go, being the horror aficionado that I am.And I will say this much praise for the movie, it was great up until half way through, give or take. The first half of the movie was actually quite good, because it was building up a lot of dread and suspense. And there was a certain feel to the movie, the sort of feel you had going on in the old ""Poltergeist"" movie. You slowly got to see more and more of the haunting and whatever entity it was that was the cause of this.But then you find out what it was, and the movie started to crack and fail. I was thinking they can't be serious about this. So now I know what happened the Darth Maul. Wow, talk about being a major disappointment in revealing what was doing the haunting. I am sure the concept was working well enough, but this Darth Maul look-alike clone? No, not really working out all that much.And to top it off; when Josh went into ""The Further"", as they cleverly called the Astral Plane. That was painful to sit through and look at. There was nothing out of this world about that at all, and it was a shame, because it would otherwise have added a very cool element to the movie.Now, ""Insidious"" is more interesting and more spooky than both of the ""Paranormal Activities"", and that is a big plus. Because they were major disappointments in each their own way. I read that someone compared ""Insidious"" to ""Saw"" and said that ""Insidious"" was more scary? Ehm, yeah, two completely different genre of movies here, so you can't really compare the two. ""Insidious"" had a lot going on for it, especially in the first half of the movie, but then it snapped and went spiraling downward fast. And the whole ""Poltergeist"" feeling (or tribute, not sure what the director was going for), also worked out well for the movie.As for the cast and their acting, well I think they had managed to put together a decent enough ensemble of people here. And it was a bit weird to see Patrick Wilson (playing Josh Lambert) in a movie of this genre. But he did pull off the character and came through with a good performance, so the genre change worked for him. Lin Shaye (playing Elise Rainer) had some big shoes to fill out, standing up against the iconic character Tangina (played by Zelda Rubinstein) in the classic ""Poltergeist"" movies. But still, Lin Shaye did it well and added her own unique touch to the movie.I had been looking forward to watching ""Insidious"", but was sorely disappointed. My low rating for the movie is because of the nature of the entity behind the haunting and the last half of the movie. Had the entity been something else, a high rating would have been given. What pulls up the score is the dread and suspense that the movie managed to build up in the first half. I will say that for a horror movie, then ""Insidious"" does a better job than many others.""Insidious"" provides adequate entertainment for an evening in front of the screen, but for those who have been addicted to the horror movies for many, many years (like I have), there is just something unsatisfying about the end result.",Insidious
14,Coventry,"Impressive, atmosphere-driven horror.",8,12 January 2012,"Titles that spontaneously spring to mind when reviewing ""Insidious"" are ""Poltergeist"", ""The Haunting"" and ""The Exorcist"". Now, you'll have to admit that there are far worse movies in the genre to get compared with! ""Insidious"" is another collaboration between the multi-talented writer/actor Leigh Whannell and the multi-talented director James Wan. The duo was previously responsible for the original – and undoubtedly still the best – ""Saw"" and the creepy ventriloquist chiller ""Dead Silence"". Especially compared to their gore-soaked debut feature ""Saw"", ""Insidious"" is a completely different kind of horror movie. It's a mature and effectively slow-brooding horror story that thrives on atmosphere, intelligent plotting and a few imaginative themes that will keep even the most experienced and knowledgeable horror fanatics intrigued. The story opens like thirteen ghost movies in a dozen do A happy young family moves into their newly purchased dream house, but not much later their oldest son – presumably due to a banal fall from a ladder – slips into a mysterious coma that perplexes all medical experts. Renai, the mother, is convinced that somehow the new house is haunted and soon after begins to hear eerie noises through the baby monitor and see ghostly appearances in her boy's room. She manages to persuade her husband to move elsewhere, but when the strange paranormal occurrences continue, they get the professional help of a spiritual medium. She discovers that the son isn't suffering from an unknown illness, but that he's gifted with the ability to explore alternate dimensions during his sleep. Only,  he stepped across a dangerous boundary this last time. And, moreover, his gift seems to be hereditary Admittedly the first full hour of ""Insidious"" is rather uneventful and very vague, but Wan and Whannell nevertheless succeed in keeping you confident that the wait will be worthwhile. You just sense that it won't be another routine and clichéd haunted-house thriller. The ambiance is similar and the clues point in that direction, but the films admirably comes with an innovative twists on the supernatural themes. The last half hour is very powerful and contains a handful of truly efficient ""jumpy"" moments, albeit still without gore or expensive special effects! The last five minutes actually even qualify as the strongest horror finale I've seen in a few years. The acting performances are decent (great to see Barbara Hershey again!) and the set-pieces are well selected. I can only recommend this movie.",Insidious
15,michaelRokeefe,An unexplainable coma.,5,31 August 2011,"A psychological thriller from director James Wan. According to Merriam-Webster...Insidious:treacherous; having a collective effect. Josh Lambert(Patrick Wilson)moves his family into a brand new home and immediately Josh and his wife Renai(Rose Byrne)hear strange noises in the middle of the night. The next day their son Dalton(Ty Simpkins) informs his mother that he doesn't like his new room; actually afraid of whats in his room. Even Dalton's brother is afraid of the footsteps he hears in the night. Dalton becomes sick and falls into a mysterious coma. The doctors can't explain the coma or the other hospital tests. The boy is taken home where his body begins to attract a malevolent force. When the Lamberts begin to realize there is a real threat, they move to another home hoping to leave the convincing evil spirit behind. Well, that's when their problems really get serious. Cinematography is super; wish I could say the same for the last third of the movie. The Lamberts must give in to the supernatural to awaken their son from his coma. I just can't get into Wilson or his character. Byrne is no better. Others in the cast: Angus Sampson, John Henry Binder, Ruben Pla and Barbara Hershey.",Insidious
16,hitchcockthelegend,Tiptoe Through the Tulips.,8,6 October 2012,"Insidious is directed by James Wan and written by Leigh Whannell. It stars Patrick Wilson, Rose Byrne, Ty Simpkins, Barbara Hershey, Lin Shaye, Andrew Astor and Leigh Whannell. Music is scored by Joseph Bishara and cinematography by John R. Leonetti.The team behind ""Saw"" and ""Dead Silence"" bring us ""Insidious"", one of the finest exponents of the haunted house movie in the modern era. Of course that doesn't count for much with those not particularly struck by the formula, but it does seem to be one of the very few horror sub-genre movies to come out with better than average appraisals.Of course it's not perfect, few films, especially in horror world, can stand up and come through unscathed by critics and fans alike, yet for the like minded adults who can set the mood and channel themselves into the boo jump and creepy atmosphere world wrung out by Wan and Whannell, then this is the bomb.Much has been made of the shift in the last third, where the film brings in Astral Projection as its reasoning for the pant soiling previously unleashed. Undeniably the film runs away with itself, goes too far and the last 15 minutes are a chaotic mess of bold ideas and inadequate staging. However, it's interesting to note how often the haunted house movie in recent times gets accused of not bringing something new to the table, something thrown at the wonderful ""Woman in Black"" that followed ""Insidious""down the pipe. Here the makers offer up something different, true, it hasn't worked in the way they or the hardened genre fans would have liked, but personally I found on second viewing it is forgivable. It's like riding your favourite Big Dipper, you enjoy the spins and upside down scream moments, but just tolerate the flat standard drive stretches of track while your heart tries to steady its beat.When ""Insidious"" is hitting its heights it's utterly thrilling and unnerving, paced to perfection, it builds from whispered voices on a baby monitor to entities invading the home of the poor Lambert family. The mystery element is strong, just what do they want? Why is son Dalton in a coma but the medical boffins have no idea why? How come the entities have followed the Lambert's even when they move house? The latter of which is refreshing to see in the screenplay, it's a logical move but so often it's not done in other horror movies. The jumps are nicely placed throughout and a number of scenes are so freaky they get under your skin and stay there for some time - seriously, I don't think I'll ever be able to listen to ""Tiptoe Through the Tulips"" again without my blood being chilled. The use of photographs and mirrors bring the goose flesh to the skin, while Lin Shaye's arrival as the paranormal physic, and the subsequent use of a gas mask, keep things ticking on the freaky deaky scale (though once the gas mask scene hits it's where the pic slightly falls away).It borrows ideas and takes its tonal cues from other horror movies, definitely, and the second half doesn't live up to the promise of the first; hell I'll even concede that a certain entity is badly designed, but it does have something new to offer the formula, it's also well performed by the cast, that itself is a rarity. It hasn't resonated with all, but it was a monster hit at the box office, making nearly $85 million in profit. The market for a good haunted house spooker is always open, so Insidious, in spite of its second half irks, sits in the top draw with the best of them. 8/10",Insidious
17,Scarecrow-88,Insidious,6,13 January 2016,"A family's idyll is undermined by a perplexing incident involving child Dalton (Ty Simpkins) falls into what they perceive to be a coma, but father and mother, Josh and Renai Lambert (Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne), so realize that he has the uncanny ability to ""astral project"" himself during sleep (the ability of his soul leaving his body). After leaving a house they moved into because of eerie noises, disturbing sights of disrupting apparitions, unsettling voices, and Dalton's condition doesn't improve their situation at allit only worsens as those from a limbo-type after-death known as ""the further"" want to use Dalton's body to enter the world of the living. If they don't want to forever lose their son, the Lamberts will need to enlist the aid of psychic Elise (the great Lin Shaye, inheriting the best role of her career) and her two paranormal investigating cohorts, Specs (Leigh Whannell, writer of the film) and Tucker (Angus Sampson). Barbara Hershey also shows up as Wilson's mom, Lorraine.James Wan's ode to ""Poltergeist"" and its ilk even offers a hideous red-faced, black bodied demon which kidnaps Dalton and awaits Josh. Josh, a school teacher growing weary as his wife is in regards to the condition of a dormant Dalton, will need to head into the further to find his son, much in the same way Carol Anne will need her mom to do the same in Poltergeist. You have pale-skinned ghouls seemingly frozen in non-motion, only to creep up on Josh when he turns around while journeying into the further might remind you of the ""look out behind you"" Weeping Angel Stone Figures on Doctor Who. The home-made gadgets Specs and Tucker pull out to investigate are a real side-splitter (they are fashioned by toys, household items, and everyday devices), particularly the gas-mask head piece Elise wears while communicating to Specs what Dalton says inside the further. The bickering and attempted one-upmanship between Specs and Tucker is part of their Abbot and Costello shtick and charm. Their partnership with Elise itself is rather amusinghow they seem like such an unlikely trio out to help others stuck in a situation few would accept as factual.Wan followed his ""Saw"" formula in the bleak ending (you also see this in ""Dead Silence"") as perhaps someone who came back from the further might not be who they appear. The sound effects and music cues are a Wan necessity it seems. The ""Insidious"" titles in big red letters and the violins striking up aloud are a trademark of the franchisequite a recognizable aesthetic. The lantern light Josh uses as he moves through the further really is a nice touch, such as when he encounters those in this after-death but there is a lot of darkness, and the decision to show as little of the demon as possible gets a bit disappointing. It is shown just enough to prove how unpleasant it looksSpecs drawing of it based on Elise's description is a good little scene, though. The pictures by Dalton also offer an affective visual evidence Josh needs to motivate him to disavow his skepticism. Elise's fate is horrifying and somewhat unexpected. The further offered Wan and Whannell plenty of room to create this completely unique worldfor the most part it can be quite equal parts spooky and frustrating considering the darkness. The ghost photography is an obvious homage to the Japanese horror boon of the late 90s/early 2000s as Josh is linked to Dalton in regards to his own ability to astral project. The way the ghouls emerge and pop up at unanticipated times are essential tricks Wan relies on throughout. This film seems to be a like it or disapprove of it affair. I guess I'm somewhere in the middle.6.5/10",Insidious
18,Hey_Sweden,"A good, solid spook show.",7,19 October 2013,"""Insidious"", at first glance, seems like it might just be a retread of the classic films that influenced it, such as ""Poltergeist"" (obviously) and ""The Entity"". (It even has actress Barbara Hershey, who'd starred in the latter film.) But fortunately screenwriter / co-star Leigh Whannell and director James Wan do some interesting things with the premise, and prevent it from becoming a cheese fest. They create some bona fide atmosphere and chills here; ""Insidious"" is definitely for the horror fan bemoaning the focus on gore and cheap thrills in more recent genre fare. It's got a number of ""jump"" moments, but they actually work, most of the time, because they're not expected. And it's all acted with the utmost sincerity by a good cast.Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne star as Josh and Renai Lambert, a young couple settling into their new house with two boys and an infant girl in tow. After the son Dalton (Ty Simpkins) takes a spill in the attic, he soon slips into what seems to be a coma but is something different altogether. After supernatural experiences begin to be too much for Renai to bear, Josh's mother Lorraine (Hershey) calls in a medium friend of hers named Elise (horror veteran Lin Shaye). But things only get worse after that. Josh learns that it's up to him to resolve matters.Whannell (who plays the part of ""Specs"") and Wan deserve some credit for creating a film that genuinely manages to creep a viewer out. Wan takes his time, doling out the imagery carefully, bit by bit, until the big finale where an alternate dimension dubbed by Elise as ""The Further"" must be entered. And even when the story requires its primary demon (played by Joseph Bishara, the films' composer) to be shown a little more, the character doesn't lose that much effectiveness. Certainly one successful element is the convincing enough creation of disturbing surrealism in many scenes. (And the song ""Tiptoe Through the Tulips"" is made even more creepy than it already was.) Wilson and Byrne are easy to sympathize with as the parents, and it's always a delight to see Shaye and Hershey in anything. Child actor Simpkins does alright in his role.Clearly, the film is designed to end the way that it does in order to set up the sequel, but it does leave one wanting more.Seven out of 10.",Insidious
19,Doylenf,Scary thriller does the job without slasher gore...excellent job by Patrick Wilson...,7,17 April 2011,"Despite several implausible gimmicks in the script about astral flights into The Further, INSIDIOUS does the job of keeping the viewer glued to the screen as the shocking incidents begin to pile up before the surprise ending delivers a final blow. Patrick Wilson's performance gives nothing away with regard to the film's last bit of shock value. He's simply the husband who can't believe all he's expected to deal with when Lin Shaye shows up to rid the family of its cursed monster.One of the more obvious effects is the stark use of music for shock impact, but used in connection with what's happening on screen it does manage to deepen the sense of explosive terror. Leigh Whannell's clever script fairs better in the story's first half up until the arrival of a team of specialists--but it's then that the horror elements reach their peak. ***** POSSIBLE SPOILER AHEAD*****It's just that the astral aspects of out of body experience don't carry much weight in the way of credibility and the voyage into darkness toward the last fifteen minutes is a bit over the top by the time it's over.Acting-wise, it's fine with good work from Wilson, Rose Byrne, and Ty Simpkins--but it's Lin Shaye whom you'll ultimately remember in a very intense and believable performance.For thriller fans, this is not the blood and gore type of thing some may be expecting--but an intelligent thriller that plays its mind games with the viewer in a fascinating way. It's handsomely produced and shows no strain from its more modest budget limitations. I found it an extremely effective thriller.Warning: You'll only be able to enjoy the second half of the film if you're willing to accept the startling premise of The Further.",Insidious
20,preppy-3,Scary but bogs down at the end,6,19 August 2011,"Josh Lambert (Patrick Wilson) and wife Renai (Rose Byrne) are happily married and have three kids. Then, after moving into a new house, one of their kids Dalton (Ty Simkins) falls into a coma...for no reason at all. They take care of him at home but then scary things happen. Rose starts hearing noises and seeing strange people around the house. They figure the house is haunted and has affected their son. They move to a new house and quickly realize it's NOT the house that is haunted.Pretty good evil spirit story. I avoided this like the plague when it came out because of the PG-13 rating. ALL the PG-13 horror films I've seen (except for ""The Ring"") have been boring and stupid. This was praised by critics so I decided to give it a try on DVD. It was much better than other PG-13 horror films. It IS well made and acted and there were some very scary moments...but it's far from perfect. For one thing after it's established the couple has three kids the other two seem to disappear completely when they move to a new house. Also it has those incredibly annoying jump scare moments. What's even MORE annoying is the writer and director said they tried to avoid using them! There's also at least three fairly long sequences with people wandering around in dark houses and places...and these scenes are deadly boring and bring the movie to a screeching halt. And I HATED the terrible ""it's not over"" ending. Still it did scare me and the acting is good across the board especially by Lin Shaye. It's also nice to see Barbara Hershey in a small role. So--I give it a marginal recommendation.",Insidious
21,dbborroughs,it has moments but mostly its a waste and only scary because of a sudden loud noise,3,4 March 2011,"I saw a sneak preview of Insidious at Lincoln Center last night. There was much ballyhoo with the director, writer and stars in attendance. The film was talked up as being the next big thing in horror and as one of the scariest movies in years. Sadly the film didn't live up to it's hype.The story of the film has family moving into a new house where weird things begin to happen. When one son falls into a coma and the weirdness begins to increase the family decides to change houses yet again. Unfortunately the problem was never the house, and the weirdness moves with them. I could tell you more but should you want to see the film yourself I think you should have some pretense of being surprised (which is hard since the story is so worn out you'll know way before everyone else what is going on) The film is being marketed as being a film with no false scares, and that is true to some degree. There are no false jumps anywhere in the film. Unfortunately there aren't that many real scares anywhere in the film at all. There are jumps and starts, but few real scares. It's not that they aren't there it's simply that Director James Wan under cuts everyone of them by adding an exclamation point of VERY LOUD music with almost each one. The two creepiest moments, the first a figure behind a crib works because the noise doesn't come until after we've seen the figure for our selves. The other is a small figure in the background as Rose Byrne walks past it is scary in a ""did I just see this"" sort of way. The rest of the scares are undercut, as if Wan doesn't trust the audience. It's terrible and tiring.If that wasn't bad enough the script, or at least the film that was cut together by Wan (he edited it) is derivative and unimaginative. The plot is basically a combination of Poltergeist, The Entity, Psychic Killer and any number of really cheap films from the 70's and 80's. Watching the film I was struck by how so many elements seemed to have been taken from other better and worse films. I kept thinking that if this was like movie X then Y would happen and sure enough it would. Almost nothing in this film seems original (even one of the creatures seems a copy of Darth Maul in Star Wars). Even worse, where most other horror films have occasional moves by the characters that are clearly stupid, illogical or the sort of thing that any rational person wouldn't do, this film is full of them. The plot hinges on repeated and frequent trips to the well of character stupidity, including a move at the end which assures a sequel.(I won't talk about the how unintentionally funny it is)How can anyone feel this is the next big thing? Yes I applaud the lack of gore and false scares but outside of that what is there to keep your interest? Watching the film I was mostly bored. I wanted to walk out, but I waited to the end hoping that the film would pull itself together. It never happened and I walked before the director Q&A. I didn't care and anything I would have said to them would have been very impolite.That said, the film does have moments. There are a few moments when the film creates tension and some truly frightening images, but they are wrapped up and hidden in a film that looks like it was made by a someone who was making his first film, not someone who's made one classic horror film (Saw) and few near misses.If you must wait for TV.",Insidious
22,zardoz-13,Subtle But Spooky Saga,7,12 September 2013,"Subtle and spooky go together like spiders and cobwebs in Malaysian director James Wan's psychic chiller ""Insidious."" This imaginative yarn deals with haunted houses, astral demons, and the out-of-body abduction of an adolescent. Wan and his screen writing partner Leigh Whannell, who collaborated as director and writer on ""Saw,"" and ""Dead Silence,"" have retreated from the obvious, literal world of ""Saw"" and plunged into the nightmarish oblivion of the Further. ""Paranormal Activity"" producers Jason Blum, Steven Schneider, and Oriel Peli have fashioned another one of those horror movies that doesn't seem scary. Nobody gets butchered by a maniac and wallows in a pool of blood created by severed limbs and legs. Nevertheless, ""Insidious"" is all the more terrifying for its refusal to indulge in gore. Astral projection lies at the heart of this creepy, 102-minute, PG-13 opus. Astral projection is an out-of-body experience, such as when people die but survive and return to talk about their brief journey into the void. The worst thing that you can expect from ""Insidious"" is the appearance of otherworldly individuals who slip up behind our young married couple and generally create chaos in their house. Things take a turn for the worst when Renai (Rose Byrne of ""Bridemaids"") and Josh Lambert (Patrick Wilson of ""Watchmen"") move into another house. Renai convinced Josh to move them from an older house to a new house after a series of eerie events occurred that made her skin crawl. One of their two sons, Dalton Lambert (Ty Simpkins), ventured into the attic of the older house, climbed a ladder, and then fell from it. The following day, when Josh tried to awaken Dalton in the morning to get him ready for school, he got no response. The baffled doctors believe that Dalton has sunk into a coma, but Josh's mother, Lorraine Lambert (Barbara Hershey of ""Beaches""), suspects something more sinister. Lorriane brings one of her oldest friends, Elise Rainier (Lin Shaye of ""2001 Maniacs""), over to visit with them. Initially, a pair of paranormal technicians, Specs (Leigh Whannell of ""Saw"") and Tucker (Angus Sampson) appear with an arsenal of exotic equipment to make sure that Josh and Renai aren't nut jobs. After Tucker spots a couple of ladies clad in white in a hall way, he assures Specs that it is time to summon Elise. to assist her. Eventually, we learn that Josh is an astral traveler, and Elise dispatches him to find his son in what she calls ""the Further."" Wan relies on sympathetic performances, upsetting music, and surprises to keep ""Insidious"" interesting. The unsavory but interesting conclusion comes as a jarring shock. Nevertheless, ""Insidious"" qualifies as a neat but effective white-knuckled exercise in suspense.",Insidious

One genuine shock (spoiled by the trailer!! Thank you Trailer!!) in seeing the nasty black & red demon – a bastard of Darth Maul/Freddy Kruger and the Bogeyman – is the only thing keeping this underwhelming scare fest alive with its B-movie tropes (i.e. creaking doors; shock 'jumps', & the telegraphic score!).

Then scary things start happening - noises, people seen out of the corner of the eye, bloody handprints on sheets. So they move. And the phenomena continue, So Wilson's mother calls in specialist help: two comedy paranormal investigators and a more serious psychic/mystic-type person.The story is essentially Poltergeist, told with a Paranormal Activity-type vibe, although there is no found footage pretence - this is a straightforward fictional supernatural story.It is maybe a little too leisurely in the set-up, but once it gets going and canters along quite nicely. There are the requisite number of ""Made you jump"" moments, and the story is quite good fun and well told. The small cast all do their jobs quite well, and the film delivers.Incidentally, is it unreasonable of me to infer a connection between the fact that the demon is very reminiscent of The Phantom Menace's Darth Sidious, and the film's title Insidious?",Insidious

It feels the need to wow us with a frenzied conclusion and a last-minute twist, as if it was tailor made to show up eventually on one of those YouTube compilations assembled by a twenty-year-old who hasn't seen any horror movie released before the year 2000.But within that circle, ""Insidious"" fares better than others, like ""Paranormal Activity"" and ""The Conjuring,"" two films that it brings to mind. It's competently shot and directed and manages to provide some good old-fashioned creepy suspense. The ending of the film goes off the rails in a way that I like, getting so weird and out there that it actually works.By far the creepiest scene for me involved a little boy dancing to ""Tiptoe through the Tulips.""

26,ferguson-6,Behind the Red Door,6,9 April 2011,"Greetings again from the darkness. Ahh, the lost art of horror films. I don't mean slasher films or gore-fests. I mean real horror films. The ""Saw"" series falls into gore-fest and its collaborators, director James Wan and writer Leigh Whannel, team up again for a more traditional horror film ... one designed to scare the viewer, rather than just gross out society.The film opens as Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne move into a beautiful old house with their two young sons and infant daughter. By beautiful house, of course I mean terribly creepy with nooks and crannies, creaking floorboards, squeaky doors and an attic designed by Satan. The mom (Byrne) quickly realizes things aren't just right with this house, and as is customary in horror films, the dad finds some lame excuse to work late so the mom and kids can be haunted without him.There are some bits and pieces from classic horror films like ""The Exorcist"", ""Poltergeist"", ""Amityville Horror"" and, yes, ""Saw"" (but not the gory stuff). Remarkably, this film is rated PG-13 which means the filmmakers really have to tell a story ... and they do.The mom gets so desperate, she begs to move. They do. Guess what? Things aren't better. So mother-in-law Barbara Hershey says she knows someone. Next thing you know, two goof-balls that look like they should have their own cable show are in the house confirming something is definitely amiss. So they call in their boss. Unfortunately, the great Zelda Rubinstein (Poltergeist) passed away, so our expert is played by Lin Shayle. She does an effective job explaining astral projection and the next thing you know all hell has broken loose. Nice work lady.What makes the film work are the characters, the setting, the atmosphere and the really nice build-up of suspense and drama. Sure I think there were some details that could have been handled much better. For instance, the ""other"" brother looks like he is going to be a factor, but instead all of the attention goes to Ty Simpkins as Dalton. Simpkins was seen recently with Russell Crowe in ""The Next 3 Days"". Also, more of the backstory with Hershey and Wilson's childhood could have proved very interesting.Still, I will say if you are a fan of horror films, this one is worth seeing. If nothing else, you will absolutely love the opening credits with their haunted images and smoky font. It's a bit of a fun challenge to find the ""image"" in each of the opening sequences. Just make sure to finish your popcorn before the movie starts. That stuff is too expensive to be tossing across the aisle when you JUMP!!",Insidious

Happily,I discovered that the nearest cinema to me was going to screen the film in a weeks time. Having booked my ticket for an early showing, I sat in the cinema prepared for a insidious viewing.View on the film:As the opening credits to the film started to roll the screenwriter/director of the film (Leigh Whannell and James Wan) make a huge departure from their earlier turn of Horror with Saw, via Whannell & Wan displaying a surprisingly restrained side.For the first half an hour,the makers show a chaotic family,which Wan (along with some very good performances from Rose Byme and Patrick Wilson) cleverly uses to slowly build up an intense supernatural atmosphere.After creating a fantastic icy atmosphere in the opening,Wan and Whannell unleash some truly nerve wrecking moments,Unlike quite a few recent horror films that turn that suddenly turn the volume of the score up to max to achieve a very cheap scare,Wan instead wisely uses Joseph Bisharas creepy score to keep the unease of terror humming in the background, as the film builds up to its next shock.Although it has to be said that the ending of the film does lack a bit of logic, (how could Josh get worn out?)

A family moves into a big house only to discover that their son has fallen into a coma type state. Doctors analyze without result so he is brought home under life support. Patrick Wilson plays a father and school teacher. Rose Byrne plays his wife, stay at home mother who works on returning to a career in music and song writing. She soon hears strange whispers in the baby monitor. Then strange images of ghostly figures appear. At her urge, they move, but problems still persist. A spiritualist is brought in and she informs them that their son isn't in a coma but rather his soul has travelled and is at the mercy of demons. Director James Wan previously brought us Saw, so he knows how to present a scary atmosphere. Here again he gives an ominous house of creaky noises and frightening visuals. Wilson and Byrne hold strong. We learn that Wilson passed down this trauma to his son but hasn't any memory of his younger incidents. It is unfortunate that this film takes the cheap route where the demons are seen as triumphant. Lin Shaye plays a psychic type figure who seems too much of a joke in her methods, that will ultimately be fatal. Barbara Hershey as Wilson's mother is limited yet plays a crucial role that moves things forward. This is a kid who braves the nightmare while awaiting parents to brave the same nightmare. While not the best of its kind, it will creep up on genre fans who will expect the obvious. Score: 6 ½ / 10",Insidious
29,kannibalcorpsegrinder,Highly impressive supernatural chiller,9,19 December 2014,"Falling victim to a slew of strange experiences, a couple's attempts to find the cause of their woes center on their comatose son's journey into a world inhabited by demons and forces them to travel there to bring him back alive.This was quite an exciting and enjoyable effort that has a lot going for it. One of it's better features is the fact that there's a lot more going on in the story than just the usual haunted house tropes that are found in such efforts, as here we not only get those fun and enjoyable supernatural tones throughout the first half when they're constantly under attack in the old home that results in some great scenes as the attack in the bedroom and the blaring alarm constantly going off, this is then based quite nicely off the second half where it turns into a demonic attack effort with all the paranormal investigations throughout the house before finally unveiling the final half which is the cleverest aspect of all these different efforts. Each one tends to lead into the others quite well as the early stuff is based on the threat of something there but not quite seen to determine how to go about dealing with the claims which are used to great effect in actually getting them out of the house where they knowingly experienced something creepy and dangerous going on. The paranormal investigations are likewise a lot of fun by getting all the usual jump-scares out and really using the large, sprawling house to great effect in generating some fine scares throughout here. Even more to the point, this concerns the film's highlight sequence in the séance into the different dimension that contains some truly freaky ideas before fully unleashing the action into hyper-drive with a stellar, exciting and action-packed sequence that really sells this quite well. The atmosphere in the final half does have some great uses here especially the different demons interacting throughout here as well as the sequences with the mannequins which are unnerving and truly chilling works that altogether give this a highly impressive series of events. It really only falters in a few areas, namely the finale which is obvious the second the trick is mentioned twenty minutes earlier about the freed-hosts' body and never really has a chance to surprise because of the obvious nature of what happened. Likewise, the fact that this one is so dependent on reusing storyline ideas from other films and even filming whole sequences wholesale from those efforts does cause this a little bit of distress as there's just enough here to make this feel as though we've seen it all before yet is still original enough to matter here. These do hold it down slightly, but not enough to still make this a highly entertaining and chilling effort.Rated PG-13: Violence, Language and children-in-jeopardy.",Insidious

The trouble is, he's been doing it for so long that demons have noticed and want his physical form.He ends up in an inexplicable comatose state and the family, thinking that the house is haunted, move, but there troubles follow. The film doesn't rely on the performances of Wilson and Byrne, although they are very good, the film relies on all out scares, and even though they are the sort that contain shrieking strings from the soundtrack, and are predictable, they are delivered here in droves.From the makers of Saw, you would expect gore, but here, there is none, even though the Billy puppet is featured in one scene, there is no gore, and this is another thing that is refreshing. There is also a lot of humour in the film, even though it's serious throughout, there will be laughs to had.The film does borrow heavily from other films. Most notably, The Shining, House, BBC's Ghostwatch, The Exorcist, and Signs.The first hour is pure mayhem, and has to be one of the best times i have spent in a cinema with an audience. But it goes a little ridiculous toward the end, when Wilson travels to the further, this is where the comparisons to the 1985 'classic' house come in.Both the main protagonists in these films have to go into another 'dimension' to save a loved one.But these days, who really cares about stuff like this, when you are entertained for the duration of the film and not bored once.All in all, it's a great horror film, filled with dread, with a good ending, and one things for sure, you'll never see Darth Maul in the same light again.",Insidious

Horror films are their forte though Wan did branch off for a remake of Death Wish with Death Sentence, before re-teaming with Whannell behind the camera to come up with Insidious, one of the best jump in your seat horror offering in quite some time.It's easy to pass this off as another quick hack out to earn an easy buck at the box office. For instance, the poster has this creepy child, and creepy children have been staple in films such as The Orphan, the remake of The Omen, and countless others in recent years. The opening credits scene is incredibly cheesy and cheap looking, but it gets better, trust me. Then there's the story about a haunted house, a requisite in many, many horror films, but that's only the tip of the iceberg, as Wan and Whannell intended to lull you in with complacency built up from one's horror film experience, before shoving the motherload of scares right down your throat.Even the building of the premise may make you roll your eyes at the expectation that this may be just another Paranormal Activity, since it tells of the Lambert family, with parents Josn and Renai (Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne respectively) and their three children Dalton (Ty Simpkins playing Wilson's kid again, collaborating before in Little Children), Foster (Andrew Astor) and another toddler in arms who bawl at the slightest of disturbances in the house. And there are plenty, with the usual moving and slamming doors, a very receptive baby monitor and documentary styled camera movements that reminisces that of Paranormal Activity 2, sans voyeuristic eyes from CCTV and found footage. You won't be faulted if you had suspicions that this film took a leaf from Paranormal Activity and combined it with your classic haunted house spooks, but here's where Whannell, who also starred in this film as a paranormal geek alongside Angus Sampson, upped the ante despite having to have the family move house, and came up with a tale that's best kept under wraps to retain the surprises that come along the way, although some may find fault with his rather geeky and detailed explanation through the medium Elise (Lin Shaye), engaged by Josh's mom Lorraine (Barbara Hershey) that links up with Josh's own repressed past.But as far as scaring the audience goes, Insidious scores top marks. Wan has a knack for designing his scary pieces with aplomb to jump scare even the most jaded of horror film goers, and the best part is, you're primed to expect something to happen, and they do, without too many time wasting red herrings. Wan gives what an audience will expect, and does so without pulling his punches, so much so that it's somewhat of a thrill ride as we journey with the characters to make sense of what's happening. The beauty comes from the simplicity of the ghoul design, clichéd some may be even, and one red faced demon that looked very much like Darth Maul. But they did their job in old school like fashion, complete with a very in your face, scratchy soundtrack that did half the job since this film would not have worked without Joseph Bishara's violin-centric score.Costing only 1.5 million dollars to make and grossing over 50 million to date, Insidious just goes to show how profitable horror films can be, where there's no need for fancy graphical effects, but reliance on simple practical ones to send chills up your spine. If it's a good scare in the cinemas you're after, then Insidious serves that up by the bucketloads without insulting your intelligence. Stay right through to the end credits for one final hurrah. Highly recommended!",Insidious
35,jdesando,Would have been better as a comedy.,5,31 March 2011,"Astral projection (out of body experience) is the real heart of the paint-by-numbers horror sideshow Insidious. A family keeps moving from haunted houses until it realizes the demon is in their child, not the houses, and the other demons want him. Saw's James Wan directs this sometimes amusing hodgepodge without Saw's bloody business or a modicum of innovation. At least it has the guts to avoid overdoing the CGI.The demons, who seek the body of young Dalton Lambert (Ty Simpkins) because he astral projects and leaves it frequently, are the motliest crew I have ever seen, from desiccated brides to downright devils with tails, a posse of poltergeist fiends not quite as alarming as they might be in Dawn of the Dead or Shaun of the Dead, for that matter.The haunted house evokes images of The Haunting, and just as cheesy as that film is this one. Even The Exorcist's darkly painted violence is here with a priest in tow. Insidious never comes close to the fear I felt in The Descent or the interesting layering of characters in 28 Days Later, but it has its scary moments and even humor.Yes, the nerdy fixers are funny, the technicians that is, who use a variety of outdated machines to film and capture the dead seeking the bodies of the living.Insidious would have worked as a comedy.",Insidious
36,StevePulaski,Definitely an insidious horror film,8,10 April 2011,"You definitely get what you pay for when you see Insidious. Loud booms, a unique premise, and quite a few good scares. It's definitely one of the better horror films I've seen in recent years. It beats the remakes of Friday the 13th and A Nightmare on Elm Street by a long shot, but still doesn't match the intensity brought in a film like Frozen.The plot: Renai and Josh Lambert (Byrne and Wilson) and their three kids move into a new house which looks like it was built some time in the good ol' days. The eldest of the three kids, Dalton (Simpkins) ventures up to the attic to explore resulting in him falling off a ladder and hurting himself. When Josh can't wake Dalton up the next morning, he takes him to the hospital where we find out Dalton is in a coma after he hit his head when falling off the ladder.After three months, Dalton still hasn't woken up. He is now in The Lamberts' home for in home care. Now a number of paranormal events have been occurring. Renai starts to see different men at night, some resembling demons, and others looking like intruders. It begins to be a nightmare for the whole family.I don't want to go into too much of the story because I feel the less you know going into it the better. I saw this because I heard a few people online say ""it's the scariest film I've seen in years."" I thought I'd see it on the big screen to top it off. It was very effective and very eerie in it's own right, but not a lot is accomplished in it's hundred and two minute run time.We never get a lot of questions answered in the film. It's almost like Battle: Los Angeles. Why is the audience bribed of information? Many don't care, but for someone like me, I want to know pretty much every answer to my questions. But it's a horror film. I must really sound stupid for wanting background information.Insidious is not a slice 'em dice 'em fest so don't go in expecting ""From the MAKERS of Paranormal Activity and Saw"" to go very far. Director James Wan took a little paranormal twist with this and doesn't give us tiresome torture porn or bangs and booms as main scares. He adds bite to his bark.Starring: Patrick Wilson, Rose Byrne, Barbara Hershey, Andrew Astor, and Leigh Whannell. Directed by: James Wan.",Insidious
37,Smells_Like_Cheese,Ernest Scared Stupid was scarier than this,4,20 July 2011,"In 2009 there was a huge phenomenon buzz around the film Paranormal Activity, bringing the scare back with simple effects and noises around the house that would make the hair on your arms stand up. I can see why Hollywood would want to capitalize on this since it was so successful, so a bigger budget film was made with the critiques on the poster on how this film is not only scarier than Paranormal Activity, but even scarier than the proclaimed most frightening film of all time The Exorcist. I love how almost every scary movie wants to upstage that title when I would say personally that The Exorcist raised that bar too high for a lot of other films of the genre to reach. My grip when people said that Paranormal Activity wasn't scary because you didn't see anything was that in my opinion, it's what you don't see that is very scary. I think the producers of Insidious took that criticism too far and gave us what started off as a very creepy movie and gave us way too much to be truly frightened.Renai and Josh Lambert have recently moved into a new house with their three children. One night, as Dalton is playing, he hears noises in the attic and goes to investigate. He steps on an old ladder to turn on the light, when it breaks, causing Dalton to fall. He starts screaming after looking at something in a shadowy corner. Renai and Josh help him. The next day Josh goes to wake Dalton, but he does not move. They rush him to the hospital where the doctors say he is in an unexplained coma. Three months later he is still in a coma and they bring him home to care for him. Over the next few days, disturbing events begin to occur. While Renai plays piano and the baby is sleeping, Renai hears whispering from the baby monitor. Then as she gets closer to the stairs, someone yells ""I want him now!"" Renai believes the house is haunted. But it turns out that there maybe more to this house than just being haunted.The beginning was pretty strong, even though we have no real connection to these characters so I don't have much sympathy for them, the film does have some genuine scares. Mainly they rely on the jump scares, but for the most part the ghosts are pretty creepy. However I do have a couple complaints, one being that I think seeing the ghosts killed it for me because if they don't scare you, they look goofy and to me they looked a little goofy and too CGI. The devil is sharpening his knife fingers to a pleasant song which I know is supposed to be creepy but for me killed the moment and I was just laughing like crazy, not only that, but the way he moved was too typical and cliché. Then the ending, that drove me crazy because it seemed like the writers just gave up and went into a M. Night Shamalamadingdong territory where the ending went into a totally whacky land. The whole ""being haunted was inherited from my daddy"" thing was bogus and such a cop out. I kinda wished they maybe would have made the boy just pure evil, like an Omen thing. Would I recommend this film? I guess this is the Paranormal Activity for the teenagers, now I'm not trying to insult the adults who found this film frightening but honestly after all the films I've seen, this movie is nothing.4/10",Insidious
38,KineticSeoul,Silly at times but still pretty darn scary,7,10 July 2011,"I was in the mood for a really scary movie and I heard this movie was really scary so I decided to check it out. This really is a scary movie although silly at times, but when it comes to the scare factor, it can get really scary and has tension to it as well. I wish the main demon had a different design to it cause some audiences tend to make fun of it a lot instead of get intimidated by it. It basically looks like a Darth Maul Demon and when it actually shows the ghost it loses it's edge. The violin scores is what builds the scare in this movie, cause just the violin scores is frightening. There is almost no blood and gore in this movie which proves that you don't need those elements to make a movie that is actually scary. Anyone looking for a good scare should see this flick.7.6/10",Insidious
39,Hellmant,'INSIDIOUS' is insistent horror fun!,8,1 April 2011,"'INSIDIOUS': Four Stars (Out of Five) The team that brought us the original 'SAW' once again team up to bring us this creative low budget shocker. James Wan (a member of the unofficial 'Splat Pack'; a grouping of the best of modern horror filmmakers) directs and Leigh Whannell writes this supernatural thriller. The film stars Patrick Wilson, Rose Byrne, Ty Simpkins, Lin Shaye, Angus Sampson and Whannell (in a rare comedic turn) and was made for a mere $800,000! Which goes to show what you can really do with a limited budget given a lot of passion and creativity. The film is a good old fashioned creepy ghost thriller, sort of like a modern variation on 'POLTERGEIST' in many ways.'INSIDIOUS' tells the tale of the Lambert family, who recently moved into a new house. Dalton Lambert (Simpkins) is one of two brothers who falls into a coma early on in the film, for unknown reasons. His mother Renai (Byrne) keeps seeing creepy images in the house and believes it's haunted. She also thinks the things she's seeing are after her son. Her husband Josh (Wilson) is disbelieving and hides from the family's problems by staying late at the school where he works. He eventually gives in and hires a supernatural expert (Shaye) who discovers something more terrifying than either had imagined.The film, like I said, is just a good old fashioned spook fest. What Wan and Whannell pull off on such a low budget is amazing. There's no CGI here just classic horror gimmicks; clever camera motion, lighting and creepy music. They also do so with little to no blood or gore. This is their first PG-13 effort and it's just as creepy and effective as their other films. I enjoyed this much more than either of the 'PARANORMAL ACTIVITY' flicks. The acting is adequate, the screenplay well polished (including some pretty humorous moments) and the directing top notch. If you like this sort of film you definitely won't be disappointed.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffxjYiwLUko",Insidious

41,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,A great atmosphere is let down by everything else being a total mess,2,1 February 2012,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Josh (Patrick Wilson) and Rose (Reni Lambert) move with their young son Dalton (Ty Simpkins) into a new home. However, after Dalton suffers a fall, his parents find him trapped in a coma he can't seem to break free from. Worse, shortly afterwards, spooky events take place around the house, causing them to relocate again...only for these events to follow them, causing them to face a terrifying truth about their son that will force them to go above their realm of belief to save him.If Insidious does nothing else right (which it doesn't) it does create a terrific, unnerving atmosphere that fits it's status as a horror film perfectly, not only in the opening titles with the jarring, skin crawling soundtrack, but the impressively grey, drained cinematography in the set up that follows, with an impressive use of no sound to hammer this home.Saw director James Wan shows more restraint and ditches the blood/gore excess and concentrates on setting up the ground work for a decent horror picture. Sadly, he fails to create characters we can care about or a story that is in any way engaging, leaving it to degenerate more and more into preposterousness which robs some of the admittedly eerie scenes of their effectiveness.Horror is one of those genres where if it's done right, things work wonders but when it doesn't, it's just a complete mess, which sadly is the case with Insidious. Atmospherically, and even visually, it's perfect, but sadly all the other components fail to come together and despite being a short film, it feels like a big slog to get to the end. *",Insidious
42,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Just about conjures enough successful scares to work.,5,30 July 2021,"James Wan and Leigh Whannel reunite with this ghostly horror film that sets its targets squarely on supernatural scares instead of the extreme gore that (the sequels to) their first collaboration helped popularise. It's an admirable intent, but the end result isn't so much frightening as is it frustrating. Firstly, its narrative structure is incredibly messy, especially in its first third, and it takes far too long to settle into itself, feeling as though it's still finding its footing for a majority of its runtime. It kind of feels like the filmmakers took the approach of throwing everything at the wall and seeing what sticks, with the end result ultimately feeling rather incohesive in many ways. Secondly, the frights are all crafted in a firmly 'cattle-prod' kind of way, with loud and unanticipated music stings doing much of the heavy lifting. Sure, it makes you jump, but it isn't scary. That's not to say that some of its scares aren't successful. There are several moments that do genuinely work and bely the kind of genre prowess that Wan would go on to prove in 'The Conjuring (2013)'. Still, the majority of the movie is just a little dull - verging on boring, at times - and it isn't as compelling as it needs to be. You don't really care about the characters, so their peril doesn't have the impact it ought to. When it's all said and done, 'Insidious (2010)' will probably slip from your mind fairly quickly. It isn't bad, but it isn't great. You can do much better in the 'haunting' subgenre, even though you can also do much, much worse. 5/10.",Insidious
43,bowmanblue,"Not original, but not bad either",7,20 June 2016,"I think it was 'Poltergeist' which set the template for modern horror, i.e. family finds out house is haunted, doesn't believe it, does believe it, calls experts and then resolution. 'Insidious,' like so many other post eighties horror films, follows that formula to the letter. However, whereas most are pretty forgettable, this one has just about enough scares and creepiness in it to make it worth watching.It's hardly worth going into detail regarding the plot, as I'm reasonably smug that I've summed it up sufficiently in my opening paragraph. Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne play the mum and dad. Yup, they're happy, successful and have three children. They play the parts well from everyday doting parents to disbelieving and supernaturally-harassed protagonists and they do nothing to make you not want to root for them. Especially when one of their children slips into an unusual coma and his housebound ever after. But that's when the haunting begins...Instead of being sucked into the TV-dimension, he's stuck in another afterlife and spirits want to get into our world via him. Those dastardly spirits (including one that looks like Darth Maul from Star Wars: The Phantom Menace – so it's nice to see the poor Sith Lord can still get work after that depressing inclusion into the sci-fi franchise) follow the family from house to house until the mandatory local paranormal expert is called in to sort the spooks out.Cue the resolution. I won't spoil it as sometimes the family wins and sometimes they get horribly murdered and it ends on a downer, but, once again, the resolution follows. Like I say, this is 'horror by the numbers' but it's good enough to watch. If you're a horror fan then you've probably seen better, but that's because you've probably got classic horror films among your DVD collection. However, you probably won't see many – recent – horror films that create a creepy/tense atmosphere. Give it a go.",Insidious

When told of a way to bring him back the family will risk everything to get their son back. Let me start by saying I am not scared very easy at all in movies. I can count on one hand the movies that have actually scared me. Saying that the ones that have scared me include ""Poltergeist"", ""Paranormal Activity 1"" and "" The Exorcism Of Emily Rose"". I say that to tell you that this movie is a lot like those three put together. Which is why this is one of the scariest movies I have ever seen. Take that statement as you will, but this movie had me sitting up with the lights on for almost the entire time. I'm actually a little surprised that this movie is only PG-13, but that just shows how desensitized we are getting to horror. One of the best things this movie has going for it is that it is scary without being gory. This movie creeped the hell out of me, and I loved every minute of it. Overall, I would call this ""Paranormal Activity"" meets ""Poltergeist"" mixed with ""What Dreams May Come"", with a dash of whatever will make you scream. Watch this, but not alone.

50,filipemanuelneto,A movie which cleverly uses minimalism.,8,16 January 2017,"This movie did not promise much but it ended up deserving my congratulations. Traveling out of the body, sleeping or hypnosis, is a rare theme in horror films and has given body to the film in an elegant and solid way. The film does not allow us to have an immediate perception of what is really happening, and this helps to lengthen the suspense and mystery around it, which gradually becomes more intense, grabbing the audience. James Wan, the director, made his reputation with the ""Saw"" franchise, which I do not appreciate for being too graphic. Apparently, this director is truly capable of doing horror without resorting to liters of false blood. Lin Shaye is the most notable actress in the film, with a strong presence and a charisma built on experience and talent, but Patrick Wilson, in the role of Josh, was also at ease and made a good performance, in harmony with Rose Byrne. The film has an interesting ending, although without the intensity that we could be expecting. Another thing I find pleasant is the use of cinematic solutions that are alternative to the avalanche of special effects that we are used to, as it was done for the evil entity or when it was decided to show ""The Further"" as a dark and misty place. The sound effects, a classic haunted house setting and a purposefully gray cinematography do the rest and make this movie worth remembering. Refined and elegant, the film still uses some usual clichés in the horror and haunting films, but does so in the right way and so convincingly that it ends up being another plus point in this great quality film.",Insidious

As a fan of James Wan (Saw, Death sentence n Dead silence), i was excited to see this film. Insidious starts off on a routine note - a family moves into a new house and are absolutely in love with it. Soon strange, supernatural-like things start to happen n the son goes into coma after falling from a ladder in the attic. Sensibly the family moves into a new house. Thinking they've left those occurrences behind, they soon discover that it's not the house that was haunted but their son. Insidious was actually scary at some points. There were several pretty chilling set pieces and the ghost designs were particularly creepy. There is this one scene where the red demon is standing next to the sons bed n the granny inquires the demon. Man, that really terrified me. Another scene was the one wher someone is walking behind the curtains. While watching this scene i turned behind to check my window. The scary moments are well-paced and always effective. Creepy figures emerge from the shadows and appear in the background in an unpredictable fashion. The soundtrack complemented it well. The cast is remarkable. Patrick Wilson, Rose Byrne n Lin Shaye all gave good performances.",Insidious
53,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"Although familiar and overdone, the talent behind ""Insidious"" makes for a quality film",7,9 August 2011,"Haunted houses and questionable children have composed many a horror film, but there's a reason they work. When they do so despite years of being recycled, it's usually thanks to talent. ""Saw"" director James Wan found something of promise in ""Saw"" writer Leigh Whannell's story ""Insidious"" and the same must've gone for stars Rose Byrne and Patrick Wilson. Horror films rarely get that infusion of talent, and as such, ""Insidious"" does not get lost in that dark dimension of forgettable horror.Josh (Wilson) and Renai (Byrne) Lambert have moved into a new home with their two young boys and infant girl. Like always, paranormal oddities occur in small doses here and there until one morning they find their son Dalton in a coma. A few months pass and they move Dalton back home. The freaky incidences increase and eventually Renai sees the ghosts. She convinces Josh to move them into a new home, but it gets worse, so they bring in a paranormal expert (Lin Shaye) who provides them with some shocking revelations about the state of their son.Like ""Paranormal Activity"" (a film thats producers have credits on this film unsurprisingly), the idea is to mount tension through paranormal phenomena and expert suspense. Wan provides a number of perfect angles and color to achieve the various moods. As much as you've been spooked this way by films before, you can't simply shirk the way the film creeps in — Wan won't have any of it. In fact, nothing here in terms of scare tactics will come as a revelation; many with a higher jumpiness tolerance will likely find it boring in many regards. No gore or horrific images to be found here — ""Insidious"" does it old school.Once Shaye's character Elise and her two employees arrive on scene, the story mutates from paranormal suspense to other-worldly mystery. Elise explains what's going on — something that involves Dalton's soul being lost in a realm called The Further — and now they must rescue him. Whannell constructs an interesting mythology here and the story goes from horror to more of a mystery/thriller with demonic elements. In a sense he borrows from science fiction in establishing the rules of what's going on. It's mostly interesting, but in many instances flat-out weird to the point that horror purists might not like it.The best way to describe ""Insidious"" is first half ""Paranormal Activity"" and second half something akin to Sam Raimi's ""Drag Me To Hell,"" which equates to a nice balance between self-seriousness and horror fun. The ""X"" factor would be the performances. Byrne keeps Renai from becoming an obnoxious scaredy cat as her role's importance dwindles in the latter half of the film, in which time she still keeps Renai relevant. Wilson's character is no typical over- macho father figure or anything. Together they provide an unusual boost for horror, which typically strives for random faces with questionable experience.In general, ""Insidious"" possesses a professionalism not often seen in the genre; most horror films go for cheap across the board from the budget to the talent to the thrills. Although ""Insidious"" lacks distinctiveness in terms of story, not an ounce of it can be perceived as immature or hollow. What a rare (but not unusual) treat.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com",Insidious

In fact they have for my liking but that's OK because they've put an original spin on it, as they're talented at doing, and that pulls it through.The acting was solid enough. Rose Byrne and Patrick Wilson carry the story through without ever making you think 'wow!' Lin Shaye could've been better cast in my opinion. Her delivery in some of the explanation scenes wasn't eerie enough for my liking. And the characters of Specs (played by Whannell) and Tucker were too lighthearted for my liking and took away from the creepy atmosphere the film was working so hard to create.Insidious for me was a cross between The Exorcist and The Cabin in the Woods. It reminded me of The Cabin in the Woods because it created a story which seemed to allow for any creature of any type and appearance to pretty much jump out of anywhere at anytime. Lots of fun to make a film with that being the case I'd imagine. And the similarities between this and The Exorcist need no explanation.One flaw for me was that I never really felt the characters were in enough danger. The 'rules', if you'd call them that, laid out allow too much comfort for the characters. Things were constantly jumping out, but it never felt like once they'd jumped out they were actually going to do anything overly menacing.A good film for those who like to get the heart racing a bit. If you liked Saw and Dead Silence expect things a little bit different, but still up to the same quality and standard. I read in the trivia section Leigh Whannell made a conscious effort to avoid clichés and he did this well. Everything here is pretty original and you certainly won't find yourself groaning at any ""never saw that coming"" moments. Also, as these film-makers have treated us to in the past, you'll get a nice little surprise at the end. Enjoy.",Insidious
58,BeneCumb,"Scary, thrilling in the 21st century?! Come on...",5,25 January 2013,"Distant voices/noises/whizzes, flashing lights, music from the past, ghost busting and exorcism?! Those who think the above mentioned are hair-raising should have their mind/nerves checked and cured. It would be another story in case of a wrongdoer, a criminal, or an alien, a vampire - at least. In the era of digital effects, ghosts and devils may be catchy to watch, but, in fact, they are unable to terminate someone's life. That is why I prefer physical evil as - in the event of well written and directed movies - it is hard to predict the course of events and ending (e.g., Se7en, Silence of the Lambs). The cast is also just above average, nothing special. The ending has a twist, but, nevertheless, I cannot comprehend the movie's popularity and I can hardly recommend this movie to anyone I know. If you must see a similar movie, then pick The Others or Rosemary's Baby.",Insidious

Shortly after arriving their little boy encounters a spirit that takes over his body. This movie is directed by James Wan (Conjuring) and stars Patrick Wilson (Conjuring), Rose Byrne (Bridesmaids), Lin Shaye (Ouija) and Ty Simpkins (Revolutionary Road). The storyline for this is fairly cliche but the execution isn't at all. The acting in this is out of this world and really grabs hold of the traumas plaguing the family - both the husband and wife dynamic and the parent/child relationships and stresses. The movie does a good job of using intense music to setup and execute the scenes and the special effects are out of this world. I also really enjoyed the depiction of the demon throughout the film, the pace of the storyline and frequency of the horror elements. The ending is dynamic and intense and wraps up the film perfectly. I'd consider this a classic and score it a 10/10.",Insidious

63,GiraffeDoor,"If you've seen the Conjuring, you've seen this.",2,1 July 2019,"3 years before The Conjuring they had already made it.This semblable example of a Dark Supernatural Thriller trying to pass as a horror is just as heavy handed, just as obnoxiously cliched, just as simpering with its bland, normative characters learning the hard way that ""ghouls just wanna have fun"".With its less than original black and brownish filter making it feel even more factory produced than it already is, the occasional atmospheric moment makes me want to try and put my guard down and enjoy it as an oldschool horror. But every time I want to meet this picture half way it does something to make me just go ""f#*@ you, movie"". Whether it's an in-your-face effect, using a sudden burst of strings to kill a frightening moment (seriously, that's the horror equivalent of a laugh track) or any of the many cheap scares.Like Conjuring they bring in the paranormal experts. That's why it's a paranormal thriller not a horror. They're more focused on world building than actual chills.It feels more like a Simpsons halloween special so often that I wonder if they should have just made it a horror comedy but it takes itself way too seriously to be taken seriously. By the end, the only pleasure I could get from it was to laugh at its own expense.Even its ending (which has real potential) wasted its own potential by clumsy execution.This decade has been the best decade ever for horror. But this is everything wrong with the horror of this decade. This didn't annoy me as much as The Conjuring but it was pretty dang close.",Insidious
64,estebangonzalez10,Wan lost me halfway through the movie when the fear of the unknown is lost,5,29 October 2013,"""You may be a superhero, buddy, but you're not invincible.""Insidious began with a lot of promise and several scares, but midway through the film it began to lose its appeal and it went downhill from there. James Wan's The Conjuring was one of the best horror films I've seen this decade and I can see how certain elements from this movie (especially the first half involving the haunted house elements) were perfected and used with greater effect there. Wan knows how to scare audiences creating an eerie atmosphere and uses the camera effectively. Despite the interesting premise, I did have some issues with the characters which wasn't a problem for me in The Conjuring. Patrick Wilson was great in that film, but here I felt he had very little chemistry with Rose Byrne. There is one scene where the alarm goes off and he finds the door from the main entrance wide open. He closes the door and sets the alarm on again only to hear it go off a few seconds later and find the door open again. Despite everything that is going on in the house he still doesn't believe his wife and thinks she's overreacting. Even if he didn't believe the ghost story then at least he should've called the police because someone is forcing the door open and sounding off the alarm. I just found it hard to believe he would go back to sleep after that. The characters weren't developed very well, but the scares still worked during the first half of the film. Unfortunately the second half doesn't live up to the standards set during the first half. The final act instead of being scary ends up being laughable, and it is a problem I find with most horror movies nowadays which don't know how to connect the gran finale with the suspense and the tension they've been building.Josh (Patrick Wilson) and Renai Lambert (Rose Byrne) have recently moved in to their new home along with their two boys Dalton (Ty Simpkins) and Foster (Andrew Astor), and their baby daughter. Strange things begin to occur in the house, and one afternoon Dalton suffers an accident in the attic. He seems to be fine, but when Josh goes to wake him up the next morning he doesn't awake. The doctors can't explain why, but somehow he seems to be in a coma. They decide to bring Dalton back home as he remains in coma and strange things continue to happen. Renai begins hearing voices through the baby monitor and finding blood stains in Dalton's sheets. She begins seeing strange presences and her son Foster claims to be hearing Dalton walking through the hallway at night. Convinced the house is haunted, Renai asks Josh to move again and so they do. At their new home strange things continue to happen, so Josh's mom, Lorraine (Barbara Hershey) decides to intervene. She had a similar experience with her son Josh when he was younger and gets a group of paranormal investigators led by Elise Rainer (Lin Shaye) to come intervene. That is when things begin to get a little freakier. One of the major problems with this film is that screenwriter Leigh Whannell (who worked previously with Wan in Saw and Dead Silence) by trying to stay away from the clichés of the genre takes us to unexpected places during the second half of the film. For instance, he thought it would be great if the family left the haunted house instead of staying there like in other horror films.This should've been a good thing, but Wan was creating such an eerie atmosphere with the classic haunted house formula that somehow it backfired here. The creepy moments that were beginning to scare me completely abandoned me when we got to the new home and the paranormal investigative team began their astral projection talk. This really took me out of the movie and truly disappointed me. The scares were gone and everything became sort of laughable. I think the reason why I really loved The Conjuring is because Wan went back to the classic formula and stuck to the haunted house elements which were working so well for him during the first half of Insidious. I don't think this is a terrible film, but the ending was so disappointing I don't really feel like watching the second film.",Insidious

67,drownnnsoda,"Something borrowed, something new.",7,22 September 2011,"""Insidious"" follows a young couple, Josh and Renai (Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne). The couple have two sons and an infant daughter, and have just moved into a new house. Renai doesn't feel comfortable there and later has several experiences with a man appearing in her daughter's room and outside her bedroom window. The couple's eldest son, Dalton, then mysteriously falls into a coma which the doctors cannot explain. After the supernatural incidents become increasingly frightening, the couple move into a new house— and it follows. They find a medium named Elise (Lin Shaye) through Josh's mother (Barbara Hershey), who tells them that their comatose son is the reason for the paranormal activity, and that he has become a vessel for the dead who reside in a dimension she calls 'the Further'. What ensues is a struggle to retrieve Dalton's astral body and return it to his physical one.James Wan and Leigh Whannell hit it out of the park with their smash hit ""Saw"", which has turned into one of the biggest horror franchises in history (with less-than-stellar sequels, if you ask me). They followed up with the underrated puppeteer horrorfest ""Dead Silence"", and here they take a turn at a good, old-fashioned ghost story that's anything but old-fashioned. The film toys with classic concepts of ghostly women in black, demons, possession, and alternate dimensions, but is perhaps the first film to deal with the concept of astral projection — that is, the ability of the soul to leave the body during sleep and enter alternate planes of existence. It's a concept widely discussed by psychics and mediums, but this is probably the firs time it's ever been dealt with on film.In other regards, the film borrows ideas from many others; in some instances, it feels like a 21st century ""Poltergeist"" with elements of ""The Amityville Horror"", and the score is eerily reminiscent of that in Stanley Kubrick's ""The Shining"". But in spite of the draws the film makes from other classics of its genre, it very much feels like its own movie.Visually speaking, I have to say that the film stands out the most in this arena. The ghosts are presented in a lifelike manner, and the characters featured in the Further have a Gothic, mannequin look to them. The visuals are startling and the appearances of the ghosts are disturbing and surprisingly realistic. The sets have a stolid sensibility to them, with pallid and dreary colors that add to a sense of dread that is felt throughout the film. The menacing demon that is the pinnacle of the supernatural activity is visually simple, but for that reason alone he is even scarier. The acting is all-around respectable, with Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne leading the film, and the presence of classic actresses Barbara Hershey and the quirky Lin Shaye lend the film even more credibility. Writer Leigh Whannell also surprised me, playing a nerdy paranormal investigator quite well. The film's ending was expected on my part, but by all means, it worked. Standout moments: the séance scene, the ghosts in the Further, and the woman in black.Overall, ""Insidious"" borrows a lot but also makes its borrowings very much its own. The story has some fascinating elements and contains some genuinely frightening moments. The visuals alone are dazzling and surrealistic, and for that alone I'd say this film is worth a watch. With all of its elements put together, it feels ""off"" in a way, but one has to wonder if it is supposed to. If anything, it's a respectable and interesting effort in a genre that is slowly becoming anything but interesting. 7/10.",Insidious
68,kluseba,Are you ready for a dark ride?,9,13 May 2011,"This movie is one of the most frightening movies I have ever seen. Before I start my review, let me suggest you to watch this flick in the cinemas or at least with a modern home cinema equipment to be capable to appreciate all the noisy sounds, creepy atmospheres and the brilliant score. I might also warn you. This movie is nothing for people that easily have nightmares. You have to like the feeling of getting scared to watch this movie. I was almost crawling out of the cinema at the end of this dark ride because I had so many moments of scary fears and I my heart pumped like a rattling machine gun but I must admit that I somehow like this feeling and when I got out of the cinema this feeling got away and the film didn't haunt me or kept me from sleeping.As you might already suppose, this film is not your usual horror slasher or gore movie as it works much more with images and sounds. It's a supernatural movie about demons and ghosts but that won't stop you from getting addicted from the bottom to the top to this intense and dark movie. It starts all very slow just to get more and more profound and scary and to end with a big bang and a little twist.This is a movie full of ups and downs. The sound rises, the camera moves into a dark room and an actor opens a door or looks somewhere and you expect something scary but nothing happens at all. You get used to it, the music slows down, the actors breathes and feels relieved when suddenly a dark scheme appears and almost freaks him to death in a moment of relative tranquillity. That's what's so strong about this movie. Even if you know what happens and what the strange things mean or look like, you never know when they appear, how they appear and what happens next. This movie plays with wrong expectations, terrible fears and emotions. I have rarely seen anything that was as scary as this.My only reason to not give the top rating is that the general idea of the movie is nothing new and could have been even more original. But the rest is great from the camera works over the realistic acting to the brilliant score. In times of ""Saw 7"" or ""Scary Movie 4"", this flick is a true relief. It helps to vote up the reputation of a genre that has become too commercial, gore and ridiculous in the last few years and should get the status of a future classic. This movie might be the renaissance of a whole genre and is on one level with the scary classics from the seventies and eighties and unites the old and the new generation with its creepy approach. This is the first big cinematic highlight of the year 2011. Don't miss the chance to watch it.Are you ready for a dark ride?",Insidious

This movie gave me chills when I watched it, it truly is just really scary, especially at night, when I watched it. And the way they ended it, oh my goodness, the ended just leaves you shocked and scared to sleep alone at the same time.

Can Dalton still be saved?The device used to explain what happened to Dalton and what can be done to deal with the situation was quite ingeniously conceived by the writer Leigh Whannell. However, the execution though by the director James Wan is a tad disappointing in several parts. This movie pulls out all of the traditional horror tricks to make this movie scary. The shadowy darkness, the loud startling music, all to bring about a creepy atmosphere and jolting surprises and screams from the audience. The images of the ghostly tormentors while disturbing and unsettling are more weird than really scary. I believe that I may have been affected by expecting too much from this film.

72,jfgibson73,Horror movie with some contrasting elements,7,27 September 2015,"This was a well-made horror movie that built slowly, increasing the tension as it went. A family is plagued by unseen forces, causing one of their children to slip into a coma. When they contact an expert, they find out ghosts and demons are trying to posses them, and the father has to enter the shadow world to get his kid back. There were some pretty effective moments, such as the scene in the fire demon's lair. This movie has some quieter moments with deliberate pacing, but also goes over the top in a way that makes it stand out. It has a sense of theatrics, such as the loud, flashy title card at the beginning. The ending is a cliffhanger, but after viewing the second movie, I don't hold that against them. It's not like some movies that leave things wide open--this ending had very specific plot points the sequel needed to follow up on. The mixture of low key and flashy scenes distinguish this movie from most current horror, and I enjoy watching back many of the well done segments.",Insidious
73,TOMNEL,One of the best horror films I've seen in years!,8,2 April 2011,"I rarely go to see horror films in the theaters anymore, mainly because 90% or more are complete garbage. They are only there to give a cheap scare, and feature bad acting, and awful scripts. This movie gives some cheap scares, but it also gives more than that. It features images that have been stuck in my brain. It's not all quick jump scenes, but instead, it also has scenes that scare without having a blast of music or a quick run across the screen. This is a film that wants to, and almost transcends the genre of typical horror fare, but kind of falls into a middle ground between trashy horror films and well thought out horror films. Either way, it is still one of the best horror films to come out in the last few years.After their son falls into a mysterious coma, Josh and Renai Lambert begin seeing and hearing frightening things in their new house. They decide to move, and still, mysterious creatures inhabit the house. After calling in a psychic, they learn that their boy is a skilled astroprojector, and in his sleep, his soul traveled too far from his body, and was trapped by malevolent spirits. It's up to Josh to think back to his repressed childhood and astroproject himself to find his son in a horrifying place called ""The Further"".This horror movie has something that most recent one's haven't, and that's likable lead characters that the audience actually cares about. Unlike typical ""kill 'em off"" horror flicks, this film develops it's leads enough for the audience to root for them, instead of rooting for their death. The writing wasn't too bad, and the decisions the characters make don't usually come off as completely idiotic. Often in horror films, the characters never seem to remember the scene before and stay in the house for another night, and while there is a little bit of idiocy going on here, the characters seem real for the most part and don't forget previous scenes of terror just to keep them conveniently in harm's way.Horror is the genre here, so the question is, ""Is this movie scary?"" I would say it definitely is. The atmosphere is tense, and even when nothing is happening, and we aren't waiting for something to happen, things can be really creepy. A scene where Patrick Wilson is looking at drawings is enormously creepy, and never does a jump happen, or does the film make you believe one is coming. A few images here have stuck with me, and when they appeared in the film, they were both genuinely startling, and disturbing, where they stay with you much after the movie is over. And this film is consistently scary. Even the chaotic musical score was scary, and fairly memorable, and I haven't had the music in a horror film stick with me since maybe ""The Sixth Sense"". Rottentomatoes has started writing sillier and less reflective summaries of their movies since they hooked up with Flixter, and this one is a great example of how much I disagree with them. They refer to the third act as shaky...I would actually say that was the most original and interesting part of the entire movie. The astroprojected world is an example of how this film transcends the typical horror movie. It's so creative, and understated at the same time. It's dark, and creepy, but also surreal and artistic, and the creativity of the third act makes this movie feel more like the original ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" or ""Poltergeist"" than say ""One Missed Call"". The dream world is dark and hard to see, but that only makes it all the more fascinating, and the whole trip to ""The Further"" is worth admission price alone. It's an original aspect of a not-so original, but nonetheless effective movie. It was thrilling to see such a competently made and genuinely scary movie in this ever dwindling genre. I highly recommend this one, for a good and scary time at the movies, with a film that surely won't be soon forgotten like so many others of the genre.My rating: *** out of ****. 100 mins. PG-13 for terror and violence, and language.",Insidious
74,aharmas,Truly Scary Tale,9,5 January 2016,"""Insidious"" raised the bar high for future directors of ""scary"" movies. James Wan keeps that camera on people long enough to see and understand their feelings. He also knows that too much sometimes is just too much. It's the quiet and the suspense that freaks us out because we just don't know when something or someone is about to strike. A comatose child, garbled static, concerned and irritated adults... they all add up to us forgetting it's a tale of possession and the supernatural. We become invested in the future of these people and the ultimate fate of the young boy.It's always dark in just about every scene, with people both on and off the screen straining to see if we can believe our eyes. Ghosts appear, threaten us, leave enough clues so we can't doubt the reality of their existence, but what is worse than knowing others might just think we are crazy?Byrne and Wilson are very effective as the afflicted parents. They're young, and the film's believability factor increases because they look like modern people who wouldn't be acting irrational unless something bad and special would be truly be invading their lives. I like how so little time is wasted in dialogue and much depends on their reactions to all the supernatural happenings. The film actually picks up steam as they move to a new house, and things just happen to get worse.So well put together is the movie that I could ignore how much it borrows from other movies, from the rocking horse, to the marks left behind by others, to the anachronistic music and the appearances of the mysterious children. It doesn't matter because we have a good director putting it together, and veterans like Hershey providing support.Enjoy the transformation, the decline of reason and the futility of what we always thought would work, and don't despair, there's plenty of originality, too, and everything works when the mood is just right.",Insidious
75,questl-18592,Darth Sidious 1,6,28 September 2020,"Insidious is really just the same old movie with a bit of polish and a paint job. Don't get me wrong, the paint and polish are nice but when I stop to think about what's actually happening it becomes so obvious how generic this is.Family moves into a house where there's an evil thing, evil thing decides to start tormenting a select couple members of said family, fake out, ending. There's even a whole portion that felt like a straight rip on Poltergeist. The acting is fine, but nothing stellar. Bigger issue is the way the script seems to force some stuff and makes it feel a bit clunky.Still, despite all that, this is filmed brilliantly. There's some legitimately creepy shots here and some fascinating effects. It also does a decent amount of background work which, save for an audio cue, don't have attention drawn to them and I feel like that's often very effective.All in all, the story itself is pretty average, as is the acting but the cinematography really is a saving grace and gives it a bump. If you like horror movies then this one is worth a stream. If you don't, I can't say I felt this was really providing much else to make it more accessible.",Insidious
76,aidanratesmovies,Wan goes Further into the Unknown,9,27 July 2021,"A creative and incredibly clever little horror flick- Insidious is yet again another brilliant and iconic horror film from Wan and easily one of his best. To start off with the cons of the film, although it hardly matters in the entirety of things, I feel the way they introduced all the 'further' concepts and such was a bit heavy handed and if they took a bit more time to explain it- would honestly prove to be a bit better in terms of how the story is told. Besides that though, I truly did love this movie. The acting is great, with the phenomenal Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne in the starring roles, and Lin Shaye in easily the biggest moment of her career. It's hardly the acting that makes this film run though, but truly through Wan's creative vision and Leigh Whannell creative storytelling are we able to transcend what we have seen in horror films and ghost stories before for a truly original and exciting experience. The atmosphere is incredibly done, and Wan uses every frame to the most of his ability. The cinematography is excellent, as well as the score, providing for some of the scariest scenes you will ever witness in a PG-13 movie- and honestly from many horror flicks still today. Its execution of ideas and themes are for the most part pretty well done and clever, and the film ends in one of the most daring ways you can think, and I honestly left feeling quite impressed. In the end, Insidious is as brilliant as it is iconic. It may not be as good as Wan's Conjuring films but it certainly stands strong on its own.My Rating: 9.3/10.",Insidious
77,valleyjohn,Spoilt by the comical Ghostbusters.,7,5 July 2011,It's not easy to make genuinely scary horror movie any more. Most great ideas have been done and Hollywood has a lazy habit remaking the best Asian and European horrors and failing Miserably. Insidious is an above average horror that really tries it's best to scare the audience but ultimately is let down by a ridiculous storyline and the introduction of two comical characters.This film is a little bit like freeky 1980's horror film Poltergeist. The kid gets lost in some kind of ghost world so the family call in a specialist to get him back. the problem with this film is that the specialist brings with her a comical pair of ghostbusters and it totally kills the atmosphere.This film does have it's fair share of scary moments and for that it has to be applauded but in the end it just falls short of being a really good horror flick.,Insidious

79,Reviews_of_the_Dead,One of the Best Haunted Films,10,11 January 2020,"This was a movie that I'm not going to lie, terrified me the first time that I saw it. I was fresh out of college, saw this with a couple friends from high school and was living with my grandma at that time. This legit made me feel uneasy to the point where I was turning on lights before entering hallways and rooms. I watched this only for the second time with my girlfriend and was curious how this would hold up. The synopsis is a family looks to prevent evil spirits from trapping their comatose child in a realm called The Further.We begin with a family moving into a new house. The father is Josh Lamber (Patrick Wilson) who is a school teacher. His wife is unemployed at the moment Renai (Rose Byrne). She is a composer and is currently home with their baby daughter and while also working on composing music to sell. They also have two sons, Dalton (Ty Simpkins) and Foster (Andrew Astor).She begins to notice funny things going on in the house. One morning she places some of her books on a shelf and later on that day, they're knocked all over the floor. It gets really creepy when she is working at her piano and hears someone talking in her baby's room over the monitor. Upon investigating, she finds nothing. Days later, Dalton falls into an odd coma. The doctors do not know why it has happened or what to do for him. They finally bring him home and take care of him there.Spooky things happen like doors opening on their own, strange noises and seeing ghosts. It continues to the point where bloody prints from a hand that doesn't look quite human are found on Dalton's sheet. Josh isn't able to concentrate at home and he stays even later at schools quite a bit to the point he's noding off and this causes a strain on their relationship. Renai finally gets freaked to the point that forces the family to move again.It doesn't take long for the haunting to continue in the new home and Josh's mother Lorraine (Barbara Hershey) isn't all that surprised by it. She brings in a friend, Elise Rainier (Lin Shaye), who is a psychic to help. It turns out that she knows Josh, even though he doesn't remember her. Helping Elise are two men, Specs (Leigh Whannell) and Tucker (Angus Sampson). They bring in equipment to help document what they're doing. A secret from the past comes up and Josh has to do something he hasn't in a long time to save his son.Now I have to say that after this second viewing, I have even more of an appreciation for this movie. I can see how this has sparked three sequels/prequels now as there's a lot of story that is introduced here that could be fleshed out later. It doesn't take us long to get into the creepiness of what is going on here.The first thing I want to delve into is the technology they use. Renai hears creepy voices over the baby monitor and this is one of the first films I saw do this to the point where these things creep me out. Going along with this, Tucker has created different things that they use in the film to detect energy from ghosts and this makes for some parts that get under my skin for sure. I think this really helps to build the tension in a way that feels believable.This film also does something that many haunted house films don't do. The family feels the house that they're experiencing this in and it follows them there. What makes this good is that there's the troupe of people staying in the house despite what is happening and some movies give good reasons why they can't. I like seeing here to explore that, but it doesn't make things better.The writing here is just good overall. Whannell aside from his role in the movie also wrote this screenplay. I think that he builds some good mythology here to the afterlife and I like those little things are introduced early on that play out later. I should shift to the pacing while covering this since I've already said it doesn't waste time. What also works is that we don't go too long in-between scares. They're not non-store to allow us to piece together what his happening while keeping the intensity going. The tension ramps up toward the climax which used to bother me, but after this viewing I really didn't have issues with something that happens. I also like that it does set itself for a sequel, but not really in a cheap way.For the acting here, I think that it's really good across the board. Wilson has a bit of a jerk in him that because he's stress about his home life, he's living to stay over at work. He does want the best for his family, but it is breaking him down where Renai is facing it head on. I like that he's the one that's skeptical about all of this while having a past he doesn't remember. Byrne is great and I feel horrible for her. While Josh is avoiding what is happening, she's taking it head and willing to do whatever to stay Dalton. Simpkins was fine, but he's asleep for a good portion of this. Shaye is great and I love that she's become kind of the heroine of this series. Whannell and Sampson play off each other well. I thought Hershey and the rest of the cast did fine in rounding this out as well.The effects are something I've been waiting to talk about. They don't really seem to go CGI heavy for the most part. I know the ghosts seem to be done practically and if they used CGI, they hid it well. There are some really creepy things of people in certain places in rooms where characters don't always notice them that get under my skin. There's also the Lipstick-Face Demon (Joseph Bishara). I know he was done with CGI at times, but not going to lie, he still makes me feel uncomfortable. Some of the things the ghosts do as well make me feel that way. The cinematography is also very good as well.The last thing to cover would be the soundtrack, which I think is amazing. They use a lot of string instruments which really help to make some of these scenes even creepier if I'm going to be honest. It helps to raise the tension. On top of that, they use Tiny Tim's 'Tiptoeing through the Tulips' effectively. I'm not sure if this is a song that everyone found creepy, but being it this movie it has ruin forever in a great way.Now with that said, this is a really good movie and one of the best haunted films ever for me. I even have friends who don't like the genre who like this movie. It doesn't waste any time getting into this, but it also is effective in its scares. It does a lot of things that I find to be unnerving if I'm honest. I think that the acting really helps as seeing this family fall apart in not knowing what is happening to their son. The effects for the most part are really good, but there's one moment of bad CGI with the Lipstick-Face Demon. It isn't nearly as bad I thought it was from memory. The soundtrack is great and definitely adds to the feel of this movie. Overall I think this is an amazing film and I've come up on my rating. I'd recommend this to horror and non-horror fans alike.",Insidious
80,Reviews_of_the_Dead,One of the Best Haunted House Films,10,11 January 2020,"This was a movie that I'm not going to lie, terrified me the first time that I saw it. I was fresh out of college, saw this with a couple friends from high school and was living with my grandma at that time. This legit made me feel uneasy to the point where I was turning on lights before entering hallways and rooms. I watched this only for the second time with my girlfriend and was curious how this would hold up. The synopsis is a family looks to prevent evil spirits from trapping their comatose child in a realm called The Further.We begin with a family moving into a new house. The father is Josh Lambert (Patrick Wilson) who is a school teacher. His wife is unemployed at the moment Renai (Rose Byrne). She is a composer and is currently home with their baby daughter and while also working on composing music to sell. They also have two sons, Dalton (Ty Simpkins) and Foster (Andrew Astor).She begins to notice funny things going on in the house. One morning she places some of her books on a shelf and later on that day, they're knocked all over the floor. It gets really creepy when she is working at her piano and hears someone talking in her baby's room over the monitor. Upon investigating, she finds nothing. Days later, Dalton falls into an odd coma. The doctors do not know why it has happened or what to do for him. They finally bring him home and take care of him there.Spooky things happen like doors opening on their own, strange noises and seeing ghosts. It continues to the point where bloody prints from a hand that doesn't look quite human are found on Dalton's sheet. Josh isn't able to concentrate at home and he stays even later at schools quite a bit to the point he's noding off and this causes a strain on their relationship.

81,Samiam3,The stuff that nightmares are made of,7,5 July 2011,"Insidious is a movie where a light goes on but the room still feels dark, where you are too afraid to look but you are forced to anyways, and where things go bump as they always do, but you don't see it coming. Such are the makings of a successful horror film which this is. The photography alone would impress Hitchcock, and even though the material is familiar to the genre, Director James Wan makes it feel juicy and fresh. Wan enjoys the stuff that nightmares are make of, as he has demonstrated here for the third time, following Saw and the arguably underrated Dead Silence. As accomplished and frightening as Insidious is, it's not perfect.Two problems come to mind. First of all, Patrick Wilson's lack of range for a lead role is unacceptable, especially next to Rose Byrne. Secondly, Wan's ambitious starts to take him into curious territory for the climax. Insidous goes from being Sixth Sense to being In the Mouth of Madness. Wan flirts a little too closely to the surrealist category, and while the film maintains perfect coherency, and is certainly no less scary, It gets a little hard to take seriously as Insidious comes to a close.Even so, the film does what it sets out to do. It's memorable and stands out, earning it's place as the horror film of the year. I hope James Wan can keep up the good stuff.",Insidious

84,Sherazade,One of the scariest if not the scariest film I've seen in a very long time.,9,13 January 2014,"After a series of initial paranormal occurrences in the home of a seemingly regular family, a child goes to sleep but forgets to wake up and after the unraveling of a dark family secret his father must enter a purgatory-like dream world called ""the further"" to remind his son to wake up, all while battling ""insidious"" entities that are trying to make it back into their bodies before they do. Exceptional acting by all, including the children.One of the best and perhaps the scariest thing about this movie is that it did not go the obvious route of gory spectacle, blood spilling, suggestive innuendo, profanity laced, obnoxious characters screaming their way through the majority of the film only to get killed at or towards the end and whatever other nonsense is typical of so-called ""scary"" or ""horror"" movies made nowadays. Instead the writer (and director) employ simple things like ""familiarity"" and ""psychological terror"" that would unnerve even the most tough to ruffle among us... if it could happen to them if you happen to you right? Their lives seems so routine and so safe how could such horror possibly happen to such a lovely family?",Insidious
85,SnakesOnAnAfricanPlain,Insidious (2010),6,13 December 2011,"James Wan and Leigh Whannell return with a love letter to the haunted house genre. If you are well versed in cinema there will be very little to surprise you at first. Books off the bookcase, baby monitors, looking through cameras etc. The build up is impressive, but too familiar. Lingering shots down long corridors, cutting to each family member sleeping (plus a leaky faucet). It gets tiring after a while, as you can predict when things will or wont happen. When stuff does happen, it can be very effective. The first major attack was awesome, but it quickly gets annoying at the stupid actions of characters. Never do they call a specialist for their comatose son, they never call the police etc. They seem to accept the fact it's a haunting just so the film can move faster. We also get some contradictions in character, where Wilson is all brave and checking out the house, and then he stops coming home at night. The film often jumps into the unexpected. With some subtle scares that people may not even notice. This is when it works best, as the camera moves around and there are images to notice but are not pointed out. Many times it became a great movie, but then quickly dropped down into an average horror. I respect the practical effects, and the restraint on gore, and for the kind of horror it is, this is done very well. It's creepy, and then Darth Maul turns up. It goes from haunted house to paranormal fantasy. But would I ever watch it again? Probably so.",Insidious
86,Seraphion,Just another horror,5,9 October 2014,"The opening kind of fooled me for me thinking that it was Dalton. As like any other Hollywood horrors nowadays, the story builds the characters for quite far too long. Then the main scares come. And again just any other recent Hollywood horrors, the scare strategy remains the same; build up the smaller scares with medium length build up and peak them with sudden appearances that don't last more than two seconds. This lets the audience off as to when the finale comes. And then the finale builds with all those lengthy thrills with strings of those previously thrift sudden scares, with sometimes a twist here and there. But this movie contains one good twist to the opening scene and the nice additional element of fatherly sacrifice. The ending is predictable, as most Hollywood horrors leave a wide room for a sequel or at least to keep the scare in the hearts of the audience for long after they exit the theaters. The acting is actually quite good. This movie shows Rose Byrne's capacity to act in almost any genre. Patrick Wilson still retains his usual successful cocky man, even though his character now is only a schoolteacher.",Insidious
87,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,Entertaining but brings up its own questions,7,4 January 2015,"Although director James Wan hasn't made multiple horror movies, his productions usually end being the next box office grab. Not only did he ignite the Saw (2004) franchise, but he also began his second franchise here with this film. It's not a surprise that this happened because of how much of an innate talent Wan has for making horror films. At first his focus was on insane people, then ghosts and now demons. The trend just keeps getting more supernatural. The story depicted is about a husband and wife that end up seeing their son go into a coma. As time goes on however, they begin to also notice strange events going on as well that for some reason deal with their sleeping son.As a narrative, the story is very solid. Leigh Whannell's writing not only makes its audience invest themselves in the characters but also in the new universe (The Further) that is given as well. Unfortunately, there is one drawback and that is, of which this new dimension, The Further is explained. Who discovered this dimension? How does one acquire the ability to enter and leave this particular area? These kinds of questions are rather significant when this specific plot point is the backbone of the story. Besides this, the writing is captivating enough that viewers may not have these questions on the tip of their tongues. Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne both portray their characters nicely and develop off of each other from time to time. Ty Simpkins plays the child that is in the coma. Although Simpkins does not take part in much of dialog, his part is still a scary position to be in and when he does speak, he shows he can act. The rest of the supporting cast is noteworthy too, of which writer Leigh Whannell is apart of. Along with him are Angus Sampson, Barbara Hershey and Lin Shaye who all try to help the couple get their son to good health. The visual aspects to the film also worked in its favor. John R. Leonetti's cinematography helped with the atmosphere of the situation and definitely made good use of his visual style when entering The Further realm. Leonetti also had David M. Brewer work with him. My guess is since Brewer does not have many theatrical releases under his belt, Leonetti was giving him some professional advice and experience. The special/practical effects and horror elements to the film blend nicely too. James Wan also seems to be backpedaling when it comes to gore. Ever since Saw (2004), his other directorial films contain less and less blood. For gorehounds, they will be disappointed but gore isn't always needed to make these kinds of movies scary. The scariest thing about this movie is two parts. The first part are the ghosts smiles, they are downright unnerving. The second is the demon played by musical composer Joseph Bishara. The makeup on him is terrifyingly well done. The only problem however is the way Bishara plays the demon. Originally, his minor appearances are extremely noteworthy. However later on, he's portrayed in somewhat of a campy fashion. Not sure if it was intentional or not but it lowers the terrifying quality of this character when initially his presence was so menacing. As for music, Bishara's composition is a totally different ball of wax. Right off the bat, like many other tracks composed by Bishara, audiences will be introduced to the shrieking strings. Despite that being his way of creating many of his tracks, Bishara actually composes a lot of other emotionally related themes that revolve around the family in the story. This shows that Bishara knows how to compose motifs that are easy on the ears no matter how simplistic and juvenile his other tracks may sound.It has decent scares, believable acting, well-rounded music and a new story to tell that goes beyond the normal ghost stories told before. On the other hand, there are some key parts of information left out that are quite important to the back-story. Plus, some of the terrifying tension may be lost if one can't get past a particularly campy scene.",Insidious
88,raulfaust,Sometimes the scariest things come from within',6,26 March 2012,"After thousand of recommendations to this movie, I finally rented it and watched with some friends. Many stated this is one of the scariest movies from the last years-- and I must ratify that! Art direction and directing itself are quite professional, making the atmosphere become scary enough for you to feel like turning the television off! The colors are contrasted and confusing; James Wan ""accidently"" shows some random (and creepy) faces in the dark when you're not ready for this, so you can imagine how many jumps this film may provoke. So that's it, the execution of this film is brilliant! Now I must complain about the story. If this plot was at least original, I could easily give it an 8-- but it is NOT. The get go plot is just like ""The Strangers""'s, with too few differences. The table reunion scene is too similar to ""The Others"" and ""Skeleton Key"". The masks are too similar to ""Saw""-- which is understandable, since Wan is the writer of that franchise. All in all, ""Insidious"" is a good movie (when comparing with the rest of 2011's), but would be much better if the plot wasn't so saturated. Six is a fair rating.",Insidious
89,pc95,Possibly Best Horror Film since 'The Others',7,9 July 2011,"With a high average rating here on IMDb, thought to catch ""Insidious"" sooner rather than later. And I must say I enjoyed the show. It does a lot with an obvious thin budget. It succeeds I believe on a couple of strengths - not getting too gory, having an interesting and a bit sci-fi- ish concept, and very good makeup and great use of music. While the movie could've done better with set designs, and I grew a bit tired of the inside of houses, I thought all the actors were satisfactory and Lin Shaye as the paranormal lead was very good. (spoilers) I guess I would've liked to see the story hashed out a little better - the last third was when it finally started moving nicely - maybe a longer runtime could've helped and more use and description of ""astral-travel"". Nonetheless recommended for horror fans, and it's high average is merited rightly at 7/10.",Insidious
90,lewiskendell,Enjoyably frightening flick.,7,9 August 2011,"In Insidious, strange happenings and frightening occurrences lead a family to believe that their new home is haunted, especially after a tragedy befalls one of their members and the ghostly presences seem to become stronger. Insidious is definitely scary. I'd challenge anyone to watch it alone at night and not be freaked out by it. The first half will probably meet the approval of nearly any horror fan. It takes time to build atmosphere and establish the characters, while still offering more than enough scares. The second part may be more divisive, though. The story goes in a fairly original direction, and I wouldn't be surprised if some people were put off by the shift in tone. I didn't find it that difficult to adjust to, though I did think the former half was more frightening and satisfying than the latter. I just thought I'd offer a warning that how the movie starts is fairly different from how it ends. Great finale, though, even if it wasn't totally unexpected. Overall this is a more than solid horror movie, and I recommend it.",Insidious
91,brando647,"An Excellent, Eerie Ghost Tale",8,24 August 2011,"I'm always impressed when a studio manages to create an entertaining horror/thriller film with a PG-13 rating. The lower rating means the film won't be relying on gore effects to rattle the audience, instead relying on atmosphere, creepy music, and hauntings rather than eviscerations. It's odd to think this movie comes from James Wan, the director responsible for the original SAW (the film that jump-started the world's love for torture porn). The film focuses on the Lambert family; Josh (Patrick Wilson) and his wife Renai (Rose Byrne) move into a new home with their three children and mysterious occurrences begin almost immediately. Exploring the attic, their son Dalton falls from a ladder and, while he appears fine at first, he soon falls into an inexplicable coma. As her son lies comatose, Renai begins to experience instances of garbled voices over the baby monitor and visions of people in the house. Despite her husband's skepticism, Renai is sure something supernatural is involved. She finds help in Elise Ranier (Lin Shaye), a medium assisted by two socially-inept paranormal investigators, who delivers some grave news to Josh and Renai: it's not the house that's haunted, it's their son.I love a good haunting film (especially the adaptation of Stephen King's 1408). Ghosts and poltergeists are much creepier than masked psychos, in my opinion. INSIDIOUS doesn't bring anything new to the genre and borrows a lot of the same clichés, but at least the filmmakers try to do it with their own style. There is the usual séance scene, but to up the creep-factor Elise wears an old gas mask and shares the experience by muttering into the headphones of her associate Specs, who transcribes the conversation and passes it on to the confused family. I've read a lot of posts and seen a lot of web reviews of people who seem pretty terrified of this movie. I'm sure their exaggerating a bit as there's nothing really to scream about, but the movie does a great job of keeping the chills consistent. In what was personally the eeriest sequence in the film, Renai is cleaning her new home listening to some music on an old record player. She steps out take out the trash and the record player crackles, switching to the warbling sound of ""Tiptoe Through the Tulips"". Then, through a window, we see a young boy dressed straight out of the '20s dancing a little jig. By the time Renai rushes back inside, everything's back to normal. Little weird bits like that keep you on edge throughout the film (you know, unless you've been desensitized to normal spooks).I loved how the film touched on astral projection. Rather than running the same route as POLTERGEIST and other ghost films, it touches on a supernatural element we never really see in movies. The ghosts populating the other world, the ""Further"" as Elise calls it, were great. The cast does an awesome job here, everyone filling out the usual roles we find in these sorts of movies: the tormented wife, the skeptical husband, the strange medium, etc. I thought the paranormal investigators (played by Angus Sampson and screenwriter Leigh Whannell) were fun as the comic relief in the later parts of the film where things are starting to get serious. Overall, it's a really well-done ghost story with very little detracting from it. I did think it took a bit long to get into the story. It's a pretty slow build-up as the family is introduced before we get into the meat of it all. I was also sort of put off by the ending (though I'll avoid details here). It would've been fine if it had tied up all the loose ends, but leaving it open for a sequel means there's a chance for more films to milk a potential franchise when I'd much rather have a real good one-off thriller.",Insidious
92,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"A spine-tingling haunted-house ride in the vein of the classics, ""Insidious"" is one of the best horror films of the past 10 years!",9,2 February 2012,"From director James Wan (""Saw"", ""Death Sentence""), writer Leigh Whannel (""Saw I-III"", ""Dead Silence"") and producer Oren Peli (""Paranormal Activity 1-3"") comes ""Insidious"", a tense, eerie haunted-house film in the same vein as classics like ""The Changeling"", ""The Haunting"" and ""Poltergeist."" With it's minimal special effects, gore-less style and creepy atmosphere, it raises enough goosebumps to leave you awake at night, pondering what's behind the door or under your bed.The film stars Patrick Wilson and the gorgeous Rose Byrne as Josh and Renai, a young married couple with three young children, as they move into their new home. Renai is a singer and musician, and a stay-at-home mom for their infant daughter, while Josh teaches at an elementary school during the day. At first, their life seems perfect, before something happens to one of their sons- Dalton, who mysteriously slips into a coma before strange events begin to plague the house. At first it's just disembodied voices and strange noises, but as the activity becomes more and more violent, they decide to move, realizing that the house is haunted. However, when these events follow them to their new home, they consult a paranormal expert who confirms- it's not the house that's haunted, it's their catatonic son Dalton, and the spirits want his body, and his life!The film is a remarkable feat in modern horror. While most studios churn out silly slasher films, and watered-down CGI-filled remakes, ""Insidious"" is a true classic ghost story, with a touch of fantasy towards the end, and feels very fresh and unique compared with the films that pass for ""horror"" these days. It is confident to take us to dark places where the simple sound of a footstep will make you gasp, instead of throwing rubber gore in your face. It really eats at you, and builds tension terrifically. I also am very happy that there are no ""fake scares"" in the film. No cats leaping out of closets, or characters surprising each other- if something happens that makes you jump- it's a spirit and a threat! There are no fake-outs, which is gutsy on the part of the filmmakers.The cast is all very good. Wilson and Byrne are fantastic and really convey the emotions of a distressed couple, Lin Shaye as a paranormal expert is a delight, Barbara Hershey as Josh's mother is believable. They are all great. The child actors try, but aren't quite as good, but I will give them credit, as they are very young and are doing well for their ages.The direction is top notch. It isn't too slow, nor too flashy. It's very calm and deliberate. The music is also fantastic, and reminded me of a lot of classic horror scores. (It reminded me of William Castle films, to be honest, which I loved.) The script is tight and works, although it does become bogged down in the middle, when we learn more about what's going on. Everything functions perfectly, for the most part.I will say, though, that don't expect the whole film to be a haunted-house ride, as the second half does delve into a bit of fantasy, which I quite liked, and turns into more of a roller coaster ride than a chilling tale in the finale. But I still loved it, and was still cowering in fear the whole time.As a horror fan (and a believer in the paranormal), ""Insidious"" was a treat! I loved it, despite one or two shortcomings, and feel it's one of the best modern horror films I've seen. A great 9 out of 10! Pop it in, turn out the lights, and prepare for an eerie, spooky ride!",Insidious

So then again, it comes down to the instructor, or director, if you wish.The movie is a good try, and gives a couple of good scares, but is made very unbelievable and therefore uninteresting. This is done so much better earlier on in other films, so you have to watch this before the others if you are to have a good experience with it.The strangest thing is that when watching the film, you really think you have seen it before.you wonder if you have seen the film earlier. You haven't. It's just copying. Even Ghostbuster's are recognized here. The film also has trouble in being serious. Another reason for it no to function. When people at scared, it looks like they are action, and then it becomes unwillingly funny.I haven't been too fond of the film I've seen by James Wan. They are all lacking believability and heart. They are just to caricatured to me. Death Sentence, Saw (though it was the first and best) and Stygian. They are all overrated due to this. I certainly want more from my films than this, and I'm actually afraid he'll mess up Fast & Furious 7.",Insidious
95,saadgkhan,To have a complete horror experience must watch it alone in a dark room; it'll scare the hell out of you.,9,21 June 2011,"INSIDIOUS – CATCH IT ( A ) Ever since I saw first trailer of Insidious, I knew there was something special about it. Then after its release slowly and gradually it got the critical acclaim and became one of the most successful movies of the year. Insidious cost on $1.5 million and it has so far earned over $76 million, which is a great achievement. Finally, I got the chance to watch Insidious all alone in a dark room. Wow, it literally scared the sh*t out of me, there were moments where I was holding my heart just so I can pass through those scary moments. The best thing about Insidious is it deals with a new supernatural element ""Astral Travelers"", which rarely we see in supernatural/horror movies. The director made a great choice to cast Patrick Wilson & Rose Byrne as grieving parents whose son falls into Astral Projection state. Both Wilson and Byrne are famous in indie circle but not on the international level, which makes us really easy to relate to them. Plus both have proved their talent in various movies. Ty Simpkins as Dolton was adorable and impressive, after his innocent face on the poster sold out the movie perfectly. Besides the lead stars, the supporting cast Barbara Hershey, Lin Shaye, Angus Sampson and Leigh Whannell did an amazing job. In Insidious lots of contribution goes to make-up artist & set designer who created the horror with minimal special effects. Brilliant! Overall, to have complete horror experience must watch it alone in a dark room; it'll scare the hell out of you.",Insidious
96,SusieSalmonLikeTheFish,I just don't get the appeal...,6,8 February 2015,"I love the 2012 horror film Sinister, Sinister is one of the best horror films of the 21st century that I've seen. When my friend heard this, she recommended I watch Insidious. So I figured, what the hell, I might as well check it out, the trailer looked very interesting and it seemed like it could be a lot of fun to watch.Well, I'm not saying that Insidious was bad, but I just don't understand why it's so popular. I sorta fell asleep three quarters of the way through it. It certainly wasn't original by any means; much of its plot had me thinking back to the Paranormal Activity franchise and The Conjuring (2013). The acting for the most part was good, the soundtrack was okay but not very memorable... what else can I say? It just wasn't a movie that I'll be remembering, and I doubt I'll be checking out the rest of the Insidious franchise.",Insidious
97,punishmentpark,Another mediocre scary movie.,5,25 November 2013,"I had actually looked forward to this one, but this wasn't quite the successful scary movie. The tag line that goes with this one (''It's not the house...'') was even on the DVD-cover and is simply a spoiler, but oh - inspired by that Eddie Murphy bit (''Leave the house!'')?Then, why Josh' mother waits so long to take action, when all the while she could have seen things coming... it's a mystery to me. And about the séance with the older woman: 'suddenly' Josh has the gift as well, so he was the best option to get Dalton out of the astral world in the first place - rendering the preceding séance rather useless. But hey, it's a way to get a film to clock 103 minutes.And there were some more little questions I had about this and that, but I'd be perfectly able to turn a blind eye if a horror film is otherwise successful, i.e. bloody, atmospheric, scary and /or such, but honestly, I don't know what all (most of) the hubbub is about. One scene (in the astral world, with the toys) and those clumsy 'ghost busters' were rather okay, though.All in all doable, just this once.",Insidious
98,Troy_Campbell,Frightening but clichéd.,6,28 May 2011,"Scary children are, well, scary. There's something about a haunted youngster that just gets under my skin. Insidious is no exception. Harking back to the not-so-subtle horror movies of the seventies, this chiller about a young boy with demons leaves no cliché unturned. Doors swing open unexpectedly, cast members venture where no sane person would, and things mysteriously get moved throughout the night. Thankfully though, the Aussie team of James Wan (director) and Leigh Whannell (screenwriter), who brought us the original Saw movie, provide a plethora of genuinely frightening moments that had me jumping out of my seat. I loved the opening title sequence too. 3 out of 5",Insidious
99,dunmore_ego,Not Normally this Para.,8,24 November 2011,"Uh-oh. I need to turn on the lights...INSIDIOUS is one of the few modern horror films that is truly scary. Not many movies can hold your nerves hostage like THE EXORCIST or THE OMEN, but INSIDIOUS comes close, with atmospheric direction, blood-chilling sequences and lots of screeching violins.A family with three kids moves into a rambling house in Middle America - the type with hardwood floors, high ceilings and a dark attic that practically screams, ""Hey, look at me! I'm haunted!"" Patrick Wilson (WATCHMEN) is father Josh, Rose Byrne is mother Renai (sans her baby fat as Brad's plaything in TROY, 2004). Their little boy Dalton (Ty Simpkins) has an accident in the attic and goes into a coma that doctors can't explain. Months pass. When Renai tucks in Dalton's little brother, he whimpers to her one night about comatose Dalton in the next room, ""I don't like it when he walks around at night."" Blood chills. Hairs rise. Cities fall.Written by Leigh Whannell and directed by James Wan (the twisted Australian duo who brought us SAW), INSIDIOUS kicks us in the ribs with classic horror iconography: loud noises, doors opening by themselves, apparitions, whispers on a baby monitor... some beautiful scares - like the unclear vision of the Dickensian boy through the window dancing to ""Tiptoe Through the Tulips."" Only thing scarier is Tiny Tim.INSIDIOUS channels POLTERGEIST fiercely - and though we might call that movie a classic today, even POLTERGIEST did get a little kooky in its third act. Remember all the Hollywood commotion in the final scenes, skeletons popping up in the pool, the house disappearing in some kind of vortex, and the elf woman with the voice that sounded like she was suckling helium?... So too INSIDUOUS cannot live up to its razor-burning first half, although it does retain enough ectoplasm for a wild ride to a satisfying surprise conclusion.Like most horror films, INSIDIOUS does not survive its ""explanation"" phase. As per Horror Protocol, a suitably wizened old woman psychic (or medium, or charlatan, or whatever they're called) provides the prosaic explanation behind Dalton's coma: as the POLTERGEIST Helium Elf called the other dimension ""The Light,"" the INSIDIOUS psychic (Lin Shaye) calls it ""The Further"" and explains that Dalton is actually astral traveling there, while demons are trying to use his inert body as a vessel to squeeze their bad selves into our dimension...Royt...Which brings up all those usual questions I have for psychics, mediums, charlatans, whatever: Why don't the demons just come through and be done with it, instead of poking around half-heartedly by leaving bloodied handprints on sheets and speaking through baby monitors? Are they trying to possess Dalton? Is he going to turn into a maniac axe-murderer inbred hillbilly? Why murder people if they only wind up in heaven? Isn't that undermining your whole demonic task of bringing them to hell? Why bother ""scaring"" them at all? Wouldn't demons from another dimensional plane consider simple Earthbound scares below their dignity? And in the noisy climactic scenes, ghosts try to cross into this world by busting out of a closet - and a man obstructs their paranormal entrance into our dimension by holding the closet door closed! Really? That's all it takes? I thought ghosts could go THROUGH things... Can we get a Demonic Infiltration Rulebook up in this haunted hizzouse?And then - the perennial Séance. Why in the dark? Does the absence of light really affect inter-dimensional contact? Human eyes can only pick up a miniscule section of the electromagnetic spectrum - between 4000 to 7000 angstroms - that we call ""visible light,"" so how could it possibly affect entities that can obviously communicate along a much wider bandwidth (and who are from a dimension where everything is supposedly so frickin' bright)? I'll tell you ""why in the dark?"" Because all those unsophisticates who handed down ghost stories from yore figured it would be scarier. How I love scientific explanations...Writer Leigh Whannell plays one of two paranormal investigator dorks, whose funny appearance in the film is at a point where some levity is welcomed after heart-skipping scares - but his presence also presages the wizened woman and the unneeded ""explanations."" From the outset, the main drawback of INSIDIOUS is its PG-13 rating (we know they're allowed to say ""fuck"" but once and are only allowed concepts that won't overwhelm your average Lindsay Lohan fan), so with that hobbling, we realize what a good job the filmmakers did to make those hairs rise on your mammalian body. Point the finger at Joseph Bishara's eerie, evocative music.Funniest (or most ignorant) by-product of movies like INSIDIOUS is that the slapstick mongoloids who call themselves ""ghost hunters"" notice all the made-up ""paranormal"" detection devices on screen and believe that they can actually construct this bogus equipment - at the very least, name some glorified toaster the same name as that apparatus in the movie and presto! Instant Ghost Detection Device! Which says more about the pants-wetter who is using it than the device itself.The first half of the movie gives you The Fear - that notion of the inexplicable; half-seen visions with no point other than an abiding alienness; the second half is for ghost hunters with weak bladders (that would be all of them, no?).If I, a nullifidian cucumber far above the superstitious beliefs of afterlife, angels and demons, needed to sleep with the lights on after this effective movie, I shudder to think how hellish this movie must be on those pants-wetters. Look behind you, ghost hunter. It's waiting for you in the dark.",Insidious
100,chrichtonsworld,Finally a genuine scary movie!,8,26 April 2011,"It really has been a while for a horror movie to make me jump. And to be honest the first fifteen minutes did make me wonder if this movie was going to be any good. And yes,it did. In this case the slow build up does benefit the tension. And for once they actually put in characters you like. Not that you learn to know them well. But at least we do care for them which of course is crucial in movies like this.When events start happening it is asked of you to put aside logic which you will be rewarded for.So while Insidious is filled with creepy and scary moments it is not always super scary. But after a while it does get very thrilling and tense and it doesn't let go. Must watch!",Insidious
101,oneguyrambling,A solid build up quickly devolves into in-silly-ness,5,27 December 2011,"Insidious leads with a reasonable title sequence that leads to an overly dramatic actual reveal of the title. For a while the film follows suit.The early stages of Insidious are straight up haunted house fare, Josh (Patrick Wilson, Renae (Rose Byrne) and their three munchkins move into a new home and are immediately beset on all sides by the usual reasons for self-eviction, random door openings, moving books, brief glimpses at the window and distant but oh-so-close footsteps there was even one scene I have cried out for ever since we bought a baby monitor in 2006 – pity it's been used about three times in the last few years and is now hardly original. Still the scene sorta worked here.Then one of their boys inexplicably becomes comatose overnight.The following days and weeks find the family becoming increasingly terrorized and not knowing why, particularly at wit's end stay at home musician Renae.What were once brief visions and glimpses rapidly seem to grow ever bolder, and suddenly the house is infested with actual ghosts. Big loud brash ones.So – as everyone in the audience is already saying – the family moves.In the new house it doesn't take long to realize that these ghosts consider themselves part of the family, so they tag along too. Barbara Hershey shows up as Josh's Mum to lend a hand, and a crew of nerdish Ghostbusters complete with an angular faced ghost whisperer type get called in.Things are moving exceedingly fast already at this point, the finale kicks things up another 5 or 6 notches in silliness.Where Paranormal Activity reveled in leaving the audience perched on edge, Insidious wants so badly to push you over into outright fear and panic, it's just that the 137th BOO! HEY! and OOGY-BOOGY! comes across the same as the first one, so they simply put more of them in and make them louder and sillier, culminating in a never ending series of mini money shots that leave you exhausted and jaded, instead of breathless and exhilarated.Rose Byrne and Patrick Wilson try desperately to lend credibility to this menagerie of the ever more pushy undead, but without success. In fact after the (very) early baby monitor scene I wasn't moved at all aside from by momentary loud noises.Teens and young couples on dates will probably love this film, there is no gore, no sex and minimal profanity, add to that the fact that it is not at all scary and it is the ideal risk free teen movie event, (I actually thought it veered incredibly close to self-parody). But for those of us who like some 'horror' in our horror films, I advise you to stay far away from this In-silly-ness.Final Rating – 5 / 10. The game started with a slow build, but early in proceedings the filmmakers gave up on development and started trying to hit everything for a home run. The longer it went the more they struck out, and the more generous my 5 score becomes in retrospect.",Insidious
102,areatw,"Decent, but Wan is capable of better",6,12 June 2017,"I'm a big fan of horror director James Wan, but this is the first time I've watched one of his movies and felt underwhelmed. The 'Saw' franchise were much more complete horror movies and 'The Conjuring' remains one of the creepiest, most disturbing films I've ever watched.'Insidious' is still quite scary, but unlike Wan's other films, it didn't have much of an effect on me. Maybe it's because the plot didn't feel believable, or that it relied a little too much on jump scares towards the end. Whatever it was, I just didn't enjoy 'Insidious' as much as I was expecting. There's nothing wrong with it, it just didn't 'wow' me like Wan's other films.",Insidious

104,educallejero,Late to the series. It was fine but this is no The Conjuring,5,5 August 2018,"I struggled a bit with this one. To be honest, this might be the worst James Wan movie I've seen so far.He plays, like always, with horror movies clichés, but in this one they are boring. I was bored. Its possible that I just miss Farmiga (just perfect). Rose Byrne is actually pretty good (good in Bridesmaids, excellent in the small roles on the X-men movies). She does fine, but its less memorable.Having said that, It picks up once they finally accept that ghosts exists.
And then it picks up again with the final twist, which I didn't see coming. It just didn't work for me anyways. When i say that ""it picks up"" is that the movie starts to go faster, not necessarily better. I didn't love the first slow half, and I didn't love the scares of the second half.",Insidious
105,KnightsofNi11,Flawed but scary,6,4 November 2011,"The haunted house genre of horror seems to be making a comeback in recent years. I wouldn't call Insidious a breath of fresh air, but it is certainly a fun addition to the genre. The film teams up director James Wan and writer Leigh Whannell once again for a horrifically electrifying film. It tells the story of a family who has just moved to a new house in the country. Shortly after moving there, their son Dalton has an accident that puts him into a comatose like state. It isn't specifically a coma, but the doctors can't discern what exactly the state the boy is in is. The family quickly learns that it has a lot to do with the supernatural as strange noises erupt throughout the house and Dalton's mother starts seeing ghosts. Eventually they learn that Dalton is the one who is being haunted, not the house. And so begins a harrowing effort to cast out the evil spirits which have befallen Dalton before its too late.Insidious has all the chills and frights you would expect from a great ghost story, and it presents these spine tinglers in unique fashions that legitimately frighten and disturb. You'll find some intensely frightening images within this film that are sure to haunt the dreams of the weak minded. There are some disturbing things in here which are hard to shake, and make this film a sadistically fun ride. I really do have to give all the props I can to how scary this film is. I wouldn't call it the most terrifying film I've ever seen, but Insidious knows how to be scary and how to frighten us the most. It isn't the kind of scary that messes with your mind and disturbs you for a long period of time, but it is the kind of scary that makes the film nerve racking to watch, but in the most fun way possible.As far as the real substance, the real story of Insidious it is fairly tailor made to be a basic haunted house film. It throws in the twist of the boy being haunted rather than the house, but all the same principles apply. The family moves to a new house, strange things start to happen, things get so terrifying that a ""specialist"" is called in to perform some sort of exorcism on whatever is being haunted. Insidious is even complete with the two comic relief goofball exorcist assistants who come to the house to perform tests and make sure there actually is a supernatural presence.It is these kinds of flaws that I attribute to lazy screen writing from writer Leigh Whannell. This gentleman is also what kept Saw from being a phenomenal film. His dialogue is very poor and he isn't the best at properly structuring a story and creating believable characters. His writing has certainly improved since 2004, but not enough to make Insidious an outstanding film. He takes the easy way out of writing a haunted house flick, simply going through the motions and not presenting anything substantially original. None of the characters are particularly memorable, except for maybe the exorcist, played by Lin Shane. The story is littered with irrational decisions that only serve the purpose of moving the story along, as well as Hollywood conveniences that don't make a lot of realistic sense, but make for some exciting visuals.But if you put some logic aside and take some of the craziness for granted, Insidious is a very fun film. It is legitimately scary and disturbingly exciting. For a story that doesn't deviate much from the original, it still works in making Insidious an engaging watch from beginning to end. The film's far from perfect, but it's not a total disaster either.",Insidious
106,gregsrants,"Creepy, eerie fun",7,16 September 2010,"When it comes to horror directors, there are only a handful of them out  there that produce consistent quality. There is Eli Roth, but his  resume is still in its infancy (Cabin Fever, Hostel and Hostel II).  There are the Spierig brothers who brought us Daybreakers and the  Undead, and Rob Zombie who has the Halloween franchise under his belt.  But again, each are still fairly new and are still trying to experiment  with the genre to find their niche.  Then there's James Wan. Saw, Dead Silence and Death Sentence are were  shot with Wan behind the camera and Saw's II, IV, VI and the new Saw  3-D were all executive produced by the budding horror star.  For the 2010 Toronto International Film Festival, James Wan brought his  new film Insidious to the masses in what was a generally crowd pleasing  tale of a family and their fight against evil spirits.   The film opens with the introduction to the family. Josh and Renai  (Patrick Wilson, Rose Byrne) head a family of three children with their  eldest being Dalton (Ty Simpkins) at an approximate age of around 10.  The family has just moved into a new house and are still in the stages  of unpacking when strange things begin to occur. Things begin to move  around the house and noises can be heard in rooms where the children  sleep. One night, Dalton goes investigating in the attic and falls and  bumps his head. The next morning, Dalton falls into a comatose state.  The family takes Dalton to the hospital, but doctors are dumbfounded as  to why Dalton is not responsive. Months later, the situation has not  improved and Dalton is back at home where he is tended to by his mother  and a day nurse. But unexplained things continue to occur in the house.  Doors open and images of ghosts are seen by Renai. But when a red blood  handprint shows up on Dalton's bed sheet, the family moves in fear that  their house is haunted.  Their new home brings them no less troubles and we learn that it is  their son that is haunted, not the house. An expert and two  scientists/assistants run tests and reveal to the family that Dalton  can astral project himself and he has done so and lost himself in a  place known as The Further. Now, with the help of the psychic and  Josh's comparable abilities to project, they attempt to find Dalton and  rescue him from a ghastly hoofed tormentor that wants to use Dalton's  human body for evil.  The comparisons between Insidious and 1982's Poltergeist are too  comparable to ignore. Both films have a haunted child. Both have a  psychic and assistants who have weird gadgets in an attempt to capture  evidence of the unknown. And both films employ a solution wherein a  parent must travel inside the spirit world to find their child.   The first two thirds of Insidious have great scares and moments of  spine-tingling suspense. Wan didn't want to use normal conventions in  the film so there are no cats jumping out of closets or images  appearing in bathroom mirror reflections when someone tries to put  their toothbrush back in the medicine cabinet.   Instead, the scares from the experiences with the family. Think of it  as Paranormal Activity shot with multiple cameras and with a budget.  Some of the scenes were downright frightening like when the psychic  sees the face of the evil spirit (which looks like Darth Maul) hissing  at her behind Josh's head.  But in the final acts, Insidious could not keep pace with the momentum  of the first half and we lose a little of the eeriness when Josh enters  The Further and dry ice and ghosts become the setting. The creature  which has abducted Dalton has great powers and strength, but we are to  believe that he uses cheap, breakable chains to entrap his victim? And  when the creature does get screen time, he is hardly as scary as the  description and flash images we had leading to his formal introduction.  Still, Insidious delivers the goods enough to be a recommendation. A  strong recommendation. Wan knows how to manipulate an audience and  doesn't try to bite of the hand that feeds him. He puts humor in all  the right places and doesn't dumb things down too much for the genre  loving audience. There was a lot about the final 20 minutes that could  have used tweaking (and please tell me there was a better ending for  the film that will show up on the DVD), but still, I challenge you not  to be creeped out by events leading to the final chapters. Seriously, I  dare you.",Insidious
107,fernandoschiavi,"Even with this dissonant and fanciful climax that clashes with the realism used until then, Insidious establishes itself as one of the best recent examples of the genre",7,18 June 2021,"James Wan and Leigh Whannell stunned the world by releasing Saw in 2004. The pair reunites on the direction and script of a new horror film. Completely distinct from the ""torture porn"" series, Insidious is closer to another scare series, Paranormal Activity - and has, not by chance, the haunting film's director, Oren Peli, in production. The trio employs many of the lessons learned in their previous projects here. First - and most important - they use suggestion to create a powerful atmosphere. In addition, they establish strong emotional connections before they begin to devastate the family at the center of the plot.As has often been proven, the mere suggestion of what might be behind the walls still works as a powerful form of immersion between the viewer and the atmosphere that can permeate horror works. Not surprisingly, the person responsible for the frightening Paranormal Activity appears in the film in question, Insidious, as one of the producers, and anyone who watched that film knows Peli's taste for betting on what the eyes cannot see. And in counterpoint, we have director James Wan and screenwriter Leigh Whannell, coming from the bloody Mortal Games, indulging in a work that adopts subjectivity as a weapon for a construction worthy of a good film of the genre.Bringing again the acquaintance of the plot of a family that inhabits a haunted house (and because of this, comments about the synopsis become unnecessary), Wan and Whanell's greatest asset in Insidious lies in the clever use of clichés as a mere excuse to craft spooky, spine-chilling sequences. And it is not only in the subversion of clichés that the film finds its great success, but also in the way the script works its characters, transforming them into common figures in the middle of a fantastic situation, easily able to generate some identification with the audience, which obviously contributes to the feeling of fear and claustrophobia.Often, before the scare - and more important than this - comes the suspense generated, the tension caused by the scene, the chills and adrenaline caused by fear; sometimes it's so obvious that something is going to happen, and even then, when it happens, the scare is inevitable (it's the time when essential elements like sound are put to good use). A horror movie has to get the viewer's attention, involve him in the mood of wanting to feel that adrenaline, and creatively cause scares. The plot follows a somewhat disused line these days, which is to tell the story more through the absence of visual information than bombarding the audience with a CGI-created ghost show. In fact, we even have a lot of ghosts in Insidious, but most are made up of actors. And the appearances of these ghosts are quite restricted. In this case, the best scenes in Insidious are those made without seeing a ghost or in which we only have a vision of a shadow. Notably, nothing better than when the medium Elise looks over the boy's bed and seems to see something. Or when the shadow of a strange creature is seen at the bedside of the comatose boy.Insidious is also surprisingly well filmed. There are exceptional sequences, like the shot where Rose Byrne's wife (Omen) goes to take out the trash while a specter dances in the room (and wasn't he there in the corner of the laundry room, facing the wall?). Or the game with angles, with the man in black walking on the porch, and the great scene in which a demon taped to the ceiling is depicted. Wan knows how to use the soundtrack like few others. Armed with extremely uncomfortable songs, which almost form an increasingly strident symphonic disorder, the director fulfills his role of disturbing with his sequences. While this is nothing new in the industry, here (as in much of his work), it makes all the difference. Not to mention the fact that, at times when you think it's necessary, the transition between the diegetic to the extra-diegetic track (it flows from what the character is actually listening to, to what only the spectators hear) are made very efficient and that actually fit the plot.Another very well used resource is photography. With many side camera shots, the director gradually introduces the environment in which the story takes place. In this way, he makes you look at the details calmly, in addition to almost forcing the viewer to pay attention to anything that might suggest a certain importance for the development of the plot. Such use of the resource also makes the rooms appear larger than they actually are. After the plot change point, the image starts to adopt cold and grayish colors, which didactically convey what the characters' emotions and afflictions are. Finally, the union and harmony of the two resources mentioned, result in at least two very efficient jump scares - James Wan manages to scare using only the actors, good makeup and intelligent camera movements.Another great moment in the film is when the father goes to the spirit world to rescue his son. And if in Poltergeist we never saw ""the other side"", in Insidious, it is possible to accompany the father during this good moment in the plot. The Insidious world is shown as a dark place filled with memories of other ghosts. The feeling is almost like being on a ghost train. The totally dark environment dimly lit with red lights, smoke that hides the demonic figures and shows just what is necessary to send chills in the audience through James Wan's framing a disturbing journey, causing chills and apprehension.The script, even if with a certain quality, does not deliver as much as the technical factors. The story, as already mentioned, is based on clichés of the genre, both in its format and in its developments. As usual, the house ends up playing an important role in the story, becoming almost a character, something we are tired of seeing. Another disturbing detail is the lack of communication between the protagonists after witnessing completely bizarre events - which forces them to make highly questionable decisions. Finally, the climax of the third act ends up being a little weak for being too expository, since the greatest asset of the film is the idea of leaving things to the suggestion and imagination of those who watch it.The filmmakers are also betting on a welcome humor, especially in the second half, which makes Insidious bring to mind the eighties productions of the genre and early Sam Raimi movies. The classic Poltergeist - The Phenomenon (Poltergeist, 1982) is also honored more than once. The mix of comic situations and characters (Leigh Whannell himself has a role) with scares, terrifying images and impeccable sound design is accurate.And if Wan surprised in Saw by the creative way his camera could be worked within limited spaces, the director perfects his technique as he walks through long corridors and spacious rooms while still maintaining a growing sense of suffocation and nervousness. Spooky sequences are created from, like the child running through the house in front of mother Renai (Rose Byrne), the depiction of a demon on the ceiling, or when a devilish face is seen on Josh's shoulders (Patrick Wilson, pure charisma). The use of certain artifacts in the projection of a horror film is so characteristic that the use of the element is obvious. James Wan, a filmmaker of memory and the camera game, brings out an essential type of horror especially for new generations who do not always easily find a horror film of other proportions than the one that is exhaustively injected into the circulation, that nothing more is a raw movie with formulas (possessions, free scares and a seemingly happy ending). In Wan's film it is clear to see the influence of fantastic cinema both in its setting and in its climax well used in an agile way, with curious cameras as always, but never for nothing, always looking for and leaving sparks for the final revelation and clues to find the boy (Ty Simpkins) who had left his body in the real plane and his soul in the ""Further"" or ""Beyond.""Something to show Wan's ability, reveals itself even more when during long sequences, especially at the end, the red lights strike, the darkness devours, the creatures already ""known"" by the viewer appear with a different air, the surroundings enter the search for truth and justice, the connection to dreams and briefly to religion (a factor almost impossible to ignore). It makes you believe and then unmasks them, navigating through fears, traumas and childhoods on a journey where the main plot of terror of the plot passes from protagonist to antagonist, reviewing a clear scene where evil is not merely something we think it is, but it is part of a set, something greater than a simple being or something natural.Insidious is a conglomeration of genres and scares, one after the other, based on apparitions, hauntings, dead people walking through the house, footsteps here or there and loud scares punctuating when the audience must scream - that is, you certainly already you've seen it all before, especially if you're a horror fan. Some will really be annoyed, especially the most impressionable ones. The big problem is the inconsistency in the narrative, which in the middle of production, when it abandons the psychological horror (more efficient) to assume a more exaggerated tone, where characters appear out of nowhere to help the family and explain to the characters (and, consequently, to the public), no need, what was going on. Even with this dissonant and fanciful climax that clashes with the realism used until then, Insidious establishes itself as one of the best recent examples of the genre, entitled to all the clichés of all times, but still being a delicious experience, with a terrifying and functional scares.",Insidious
108,Vivekmaru45,The Downfall Of The U.S Horror film industry...,4,30 April 2011,"If this is the best James Wan can do, his directorial days are numbered. It seems Hollywood has a habit of churning out crappy horror films. Make anything to earn a buck.The topic of this film isn't new at all. Astral projection. I had seen a film of this sort long ago. It was called Out Of The Body (1989). It was about a man who unknowingly goes out of his body in his sleep and kills beautiful women. Then I saw The Blue Man (1985). This one was about a dissatisfied Montreal director of TV commercials is taught to astrally project himself by a mysterious woman. But soon he finds that he does it against his will when he sleeps, and while he does it, he commits savage acts against those in his life. Then I saw The Poltergeist Trilogy of films and The Nightmare On Elm Street. A seasoned horror film fan. I have watched horror films going back to the 30's. Nothing is new to me. This film is especially made for newbie horror movie lovers who have no experience at all and for whom this film is made. That's where all the cash comes from. I pity these suckers who spend their hard earned money on this film.Plot of film: a family of five (husband, wife, two small boys and a baby), move into a new house. Their youngest son has the habit of astrally projecting himself during his sleep and wandering the realms beyond, until he gets trapped in a far-off place called ""The Further"".The boy's father has the same inherent ability. He has to go into hypnosis, project himself astrally and rescue his son.This was the biggest mistake made in the film. All of James Wan's films have terrible endings. This one is NO exception. Verdict: either watch it online for FREE. Or RENT IT CHEAP, or borrow the DVD from a sucker who has already bought it and now plans to use it as a Frisbee.",Insidious
109,johnstonjames,"Wouldn't Want To Watch It Alone, After Dark",8,2 August 2011,"scary stuff. i don't know which was scarier, the supernatural chills or the fact that you can make a movie on a very low budget, gross three times that amount back and still make a film that is far better and more interesting filmmaking than a lot of the large budget CGI crap.films should be produced more economically. i hate hate huge, unnecessary expenditures in films and half the movies made don't really require or justify the budgets they have and horror films in particular, are often scarier without all the corny, overblown CGI FX.a lot of the ghostly creeps here are fairly disturbing. i was surprised at how many clichés from other horror films this movie could squeeze and still use them effectively and with a much lower film budget than those films. the elements from movies like 'Poltergiest', 'The Exorcist', Peter Jackson's 'The Frighteners', are familiar, but they have effective impact and seem different and original when applied with the lower budget.i thought Patrick Wilson was a very good sport to support low budget filmmaking since he is obviously in more demand than this. Wilson's performance is hardly the caliber of the amazing 'Hard Candy', it's not even 'Phantom of the Opera', but it's good enough to be involving.this is also one of those movies that people will predictably trash because of it's low budget. you know, the type of viewer that thinks they are not being indulged enough unless someone attempts to sink themselves financially in order to please their pampered viewing needs.this is also one of those scary horror flicks that will probably disturb the viewer more if watched alone after dark. everything is always easier to take and less scary if you watch it with a audience. but i'm not sure anyone should do that. especially if you are superstitious about demons or exorcism.scary stuff, i personally would like to see more fantasy movies like this that are unassuming and produced modestly. it leads to more interesting results.",Insidious

The acting is terrible except for patrick Wilson, the story line is lame and the make up effects are laughable. Some moments were supposed to be scary and I found myself laughing.This movie is about a family who moves into a new house but soon begins to think the house is haunted. After moving again from that house they still find strange things happening and they find out its their son thats haunted not the house.This movie was just retarded...like actually one of the worst horror movies I have ever seen and I have seen a lot of bad ones in my day.

113,Superunknovvn,"Creepy in its first half, loses its momentum in the second",4,20 July 2011,"James Wan and Leigh Whannell have come a long way since they single-handedly set the so called ""torture porn""-movement in motion with ""Saw"" - a brilliant thriller that only got its bad reputation from its countless lukewarm sequels. Already their second attempt at horror, ""Dead Silence"", was a complete u-turn, relying more on shocks than on gross-out violence. The story involving evil dolls and a creepy old lady that kills you, if you scream, was a masterful combination of known, but modernized horror stereotypes. Much like ""Dead Silence"", ""Insidious"" also treads on well-known territory: it's a classic haunted house flick with many references to ""The Haunted"", ""The Entity"" and ""Poltergeist"". Actually, it's little more than a mash-up of those three movies. And that is part of ""Insidious""' many problems.But first things first: The movie is built-up very well. It's a relief to see Wan and Whannell move even further away from explicit shock value towards mood and atmosphere. This development may not have been their decision entirely. People generally seem to be fed up with gore and the success of ""Paranormal Activity"" has re-opened the shrieking door for subtle horror that relies on objects moving by themselves more than anything else. That is exactly the kind of scares that ""Insidious"" displays in its first half. The creepiness is underlined throughout by great sound editing and clever camera movements that keep things interesting.The problems arise when ""Insidious"" follows through on its promise in the second half. The movie isn't as ballsy as ""The Haunting"" was by relying solely on suggestion. When we actually get to see the otherworldly figures that terrorize the family, they are not scary at all. Up until the typical Wan/Whannell ending ""Insidious"" plays almost like a grim fairy tale for children. In some scenes the tension falls apart completely, for instance, when Patrick Wilson suddenly has a fist fight with a guy in white make-up or when we learn that the main villain looks like a mixture of Darth Maul, the Darkness from ""Legend"" and Freddy Krueger. The story itself is not too logical and, as mentioned above, very, very derivative of other, better movies: From the general ""Haunting""-feel and plot devices lifted directly from ""Poltergeist"" (scary trees in front of the window, something creeping up from under the bed, a team of scientists with a female medium entering the scene, people crossing over into another realm) up to the minor twist that this isn't actually a haunted house movie, but a haunted person movie (which is taken directly from 1982's ""The Entity"", which incidentally also starred Barbara Hershey), ""Insidious"" has almost no original ideas.In the end, Wan and Whannell have made a movie, that will scare the living crap out of children and people who are not watching many horror movies. Hard-boiled audiences, however, have seen this before and will get bored soon. Still, it's not a bad flick at all. It definitely shows signs that Wan and Whannell are moving forward as filmmakers and are at the forefront of worthy modern horror directors and writers.",Insidious
114,Hayden-86055,Cheap scares and a poor plot,4,7 December 2020,"Insidious is a film I just didn't like very much, I felt like the jump-scares were over the top, the location of the film wasn't very interesting and didn't leave room for quality camerawork and the cast is average (apart from Patrick Wilson who does a good job).The monsters are well designed and could have been amazing but the jump scares aren't subtle and are overdone. The plot is also quite poor and I hated the ending.4/10: Not a very good film, a bit overrated in my opinion",Insidious
115,Likes_Ninjas90,You know your film is in real trouble when the most disturbing element is hearing Australian comic Angus Sampson putting on a thick American accent,1,25 May 2011,"A couple, Josh (Patrick Wilson) and Renai (Rose Byrnes), move into their new home with their three children. They have twin boys, Dalton (Ty Simpkins) and Foster (Andrew Astor) and a baby too. Josh works as a teacher, while Renai stays at home to look after the baby and work on her music career. When strange things start happening in the house, Renai begins to panic. She has visions of small children running through the house and is also hearing loud disruptive noises. After Dalton has a fall in the attic he slips into a coma. The doctors say that he does not have brain damage but the boy is left bedridden inside the house. When even more disturbing events occur like bloody handprints appearing on the sheets, both Patrick and Rose are convinced that their house is now haunted. Helping them move into a second house is Patrick's mother Lorraine (Barbara Hershey), but they find that the paranormal world still follows them. Horror movies are always full of boring, stupid people. They shriek, ask 'what the hell was that' like they've never seen a horror movie before and enter dark rooms by themselves. Insidious went to this school of horror and spent all its time copying notes off Paranormal Activity (2007). The film is directed by James Wan, who gave us the first Saw, but producer Oren Peli's stamp is visible. He made the first Paranormal Activity and the plots are so lazily similar that you can pinpoint the moment the psychics will show up. This is a copy of a film that was already a rehash of every haunted house cliché. True, it is a break from the torture porn trend but it's only to fall back on the first tier of horror clichés, like creaking doors and mysterious falling objects. Unoriginality is not even the film's biggest sin though: it's unintentionally funny rather than scary. The way the opening titles come up is like a throwback to 1950s schlock horror, except they're not playing for laughs. The tone, visually provided through the film's ugly, muted colour filters, is deadly serious. But it's very difficult not to laugh at this brand of horror because it's been parodied so often. In its favour, it's a marginally better film than Paranormal Activity because it's unconcerned about masking the artifice. Wan omits any phony quasi-documentary aesthetics and the narrative is more eventful in its final quarter. But it's also in the last fifteen minutes that the story moves from otherworldly and into, let's say politely, nonsense. It mistakenly shows the monsters and also tries to explain their existence through lazy slabs of expositional dialogue. It's saved by some slightly creepy imagery, though I'm certain they've pinched some from the video game Bioshock (2007). And the demon cheaply looks like a man in a rubber suit, who'd be more suited to tapping people on the shoulder in a ghost train. Typically for a horror film the characters are underwritten and the cast is misused. Wilson and Byrnes are not the most annoying horror couple but they lack distinctive voices and any life they share exterior from the house is empty. With very few lines or actions, Barbra Hershey is terribly underused. But you know your film is in real trouble when the most disturbing element is hearing Australian comic Angus Sampson putting on a thick American accent.",Insidious

117,Andres-Camara,It's been a long time since I've seen a good scary movie,7,10 January 2017,"The truth is that I was surprised and much and for good. A scary movie that is scary. It is not the fear of the scare that if you take the sound away there is no fear, no, it is fear well done. It puts you in a world that you believe, it takes you to the dreams and it does not fall into the ridiculous one, but that gives you you are astonished.The film, moreover, is made with courage, is not afraid to let you see things, normally scary movies hide everything and then get you on loose planes what you have to be afraid. This is not the case with this movie, you are watching on the screen what is happening and this way it gives you even more fear. In the spoiler area I will comment more.The actors are very well, even those who are made up, do not fall into the ridiculous, the other way around, they scare you because they take you to a world you do not know and it is scary.The photograph is very well used because it is beautiful and in the dream uses it very well to tell.The management is very good. It does not bore you, it upset you and takes you. The planes are beautifully designed, composed and designed to be scary.Fear and intrigue goes up and up and does not decay.Spoiler:There are plans, like one in the living room, that you see what is going on. In this room, we see a character who enters, walks through the room and as it passes a ghost appears and when the ghost disappears again. In others you see how the actors see things moving.

Very corny, orchestrated string music and loud. 2. The story was actually easy to follow, and not predictable till the very end. I don't think anybody in the theater knew how the ending would be till the very last five minutes of the film. 3. As for being scary, it's more creepy than scary, also jumpy because of the music. Creepy as in ""little children creepy"" with those little giggles and laughs they have.Give the movie time because it takes a while for the movie to get going, but that's what makes this movie good. A creepy person doesn't just come up and scare you right away cause that's just weird. A creepy person sends you messages of I'm there, but you can't see me. Like someone hiding in a bush, and you see them for a split second and you look back and they aren't there anymore. If you are frighten or startled easily, then this is the movie for you.

These incidents, for the most part, just get ignored, but things change dramatically when their son, Dalton, doesn't wake up one morning. Seeking any help they can, they turn to Elise Rainier, a spiritual psychic, and learn that their son has the ability to astro-project and is actually trapped by a hideous demon in a realm known as The Further. Desperate to get their son back, Josh has to enter The Further to get Dalton back before it's too late.Insidious is a really good and a very creepy movie. The first 30 - 40 minutes are a wee bit slow to be honest with not much happening, but even though it's a bit slow it does build the story & tension up nicely, leading into the last hour which is where it gets much better. It doesn't really rely on the ""jump-boo"" scares either - although there are a couple of good moments of those - but plays more on the psychological scares of just making you feel really uneasy and creeped out....and it works great.The main demon is done really well, and even though you don't see a whole great deal of it, you definitely see enough for it to freak you out. This works really well because with a lot of these kinds of movies it's what you don't see that can actually scare you. Sometimes the thing that scares you the most is your own imagination and this is what Insidious plays on. It doesn't rely on gore or intense violence either. It's just a really good, creepy psychological horror.If you enjoy creepy horrors such as The Conjuring, Sinister and The Amityville Horror then you should enjoy Insidious.

122,Horror-yo,Could have been the best horror movie of ALL TIME,7,30 October 2011,"First off, not up to the hype. It's not as scary as people make it, no matter what you read. I was terrified by it before I actually saw it. Then I was like: really ?!...ok cool, I'm sleepin good tonight.But then, the pros and cons must be distinguished: Pros: * Incredible intro/theme. Very subtle, the perfect intro/credits ever for a horror. * Good use of the music with the momentum of the scenes. * Good ideas for the scare scenes. * A killer plot that had tremendous potential. * Excellent vision for the ""Further"". The perfect nightmare.Cons: * Borrowed or simply copy/pasted a lot from many movies before it. * Acting, direction at times, script and just feel overall too Hollywood, too unreal, too polished - actors are playing mere pre-written characters as opposed to real human beings who react to a horrible reality. * Could have been much scarier given the pieces they had to their puzzle. * Some aspects in bad taste (long haired fiend...) * A bit too unrealistic towards the end.All in all, just like Inception this film touches on subjects of astronomical potential and importance - the realms of dream, reality-meets-fiction, eternity and infinity - and fails like the latter to deliver a complete, whole picture of its monumental failed ambition.Because of the great and the good in this movie, and because of the efforts on the artistic side to make this more than just a polished, soulless Hollywood creation: I'll be generous and give it a 8/10, though a 7 could be in the discussion. But there's no way this movie earns less, and it just doesn't have what it takes to get to 9 or 10.Fully developed and less Hollywood, less commercial - this has the potential to have been the best horror movie of all time...too bad.",Insidious
123,asda-man,It felt like I had an outer body experience!,9,8 May 2011,"*Minor spoilers* I was expecting to like ""Insidious"", I heard how scary it was and after seeing many ""scary"" films that actually failed to scare me. I was ready to be genuinely scared by ""Insidious"". And guess what? I loved every minute of it! Right from the really creepy opening I knew I was in for a pretty creepy experience. There are several sequences in this film that actually are genuinely scary and most of is down to James Wan's fantastic directing. Mr Wan knows how to make something creepy. He allows the audience to follow every bit of camera movement, making every shock count. There is something very unsettling about a camera sweeping through a hallway slowly. It's almost as if you are there and you know that something is going to come out to shock you.The acting is also very good for a horror film. Barbara Hershey manages to impress again, like in ""Black Swan"" (only not quite as impressive as that) and there were some characters there that we could all care about.My only complaint would be that the granny should've been the main demon villain. I don't feel that there was any need for the red faced bloke, he was no where near as terrifying as that granny! I think that it confused the story and he ended up being a bit naff.But the final moments in ""Insidious"" are really tense, edge-of-your-seat stuff. It turns out to be frightening fun and an excellent experience in the cinema. I think the effect would unfortunately crisp on the small screen, so I do feel it's important to see this in the cinema.What I really liked in ""Insidious"" was the fantastic music! It was a throwback to those 70's/80's ghosty films in the way ""Drag Me To Hell"" did with its music. It blew me away to hear it in the cinema, and I got a chill whenever something popped up with that dissident/atonal music. It is brilliant!""Insidious"" is an updated ""Poultergeist"". It's filled with genuinely scary, creepy and terrifying moments. There are some images in there that will scare the hell out of you!

124,LazySod,Slightly better than run of the mill,7,15 June 2011,"When a kid sees eerie creatures in the night the parents do the usual thing - they comfort the kid and blame childhood fantasy. But when the kid slips into a coma and other people in the house start seeing things they may have been wrong.Films like this are a dime in a dozen and they usually pick one of the more classical films and take whatever they can from that one. This one is no different and leans very heavily on Poltergeist (1982). It's still rather different from that one though so it's OK, it's better to copy creatively than to create badly after all.The tension build in the film is quite good. It starts slowly but gets under the skin eventually. Attempted shock moments are there but are completely ineffective (and might just be designed to be like that) but they don't disturb anything. As the film rolls on and picks up speed it becomes a pleasant watch but never goes above that level. So, all in all, slightly better than run of the mill.7 out of 10 dark intentions",Insidious

The mixture is fairly well brewed with quite a few make-you-jump moments and adequate performances (though Barbara Hershey is wasted in a thin role and the lady medium reminded me more than somewhat of the late Queen Mum!). The lighting inside the two Haunted Houses is almost as dim before the weird stuff starts as after, and the glimpses of the 'Further' (the Afterlife has been re-branded) are a bit like the Ghost Train at a funfair, with things jumping out of near total darkness at the rider/viewer.It's a relief to have a horror flick that doesn't rely on gross-out gore, but this is only a scary-ish movie.

129,Shattered_Wake,A wildly fun & scary haunted house flick,7,11 November 2010,"James Wan, best known as one of the initial creators of the 'Saw' series, returns to the duo with 'Saw' co-creator Leigh Whannel (who also stars) with a new ghost story starring Patrick Wilson ('Watchmen') and Rose Byrne ('Get Him to the Greek').Josh (Wilson) and Renai (Byrne) think they have it all: a beautiful new home, three lovely children. . . and a gang of unruly ghosts causing torment around them. Unfortunately, after Dalton, one of their sons, is knocked unconscious and falls into a coma, things take a supernatural turn for the worst. To save Dalton, Josh and Renai call on a ghost-hunting team (Leigh Whannell, Angus Sampson) and a psychic (Lin Shaye) to investigate the paranormal presence within the house and put a stop to it before their son's soul is lost to ""the further.""Due to recent trends within the horror genre, haunted house flicks have been rather few & far between. However, a few recent solid entries have been more than worthwhile, including 'El Orfanato' and the 'Paranormal Activity' films. James Wan, thankfully, adds this quality haunt film to the short list of recent successes. His film, however, does something different than other ghost stories: It's funny. While it doesn't go as over-the-top with its humour as a film like 'Drag Me to Hell,' it does blend enough laughs throughout to greatly enhance the entertainment value of the overall film, making it feel like a classic-style dark house flick. If only Vincent Price could've been around to perfect that feeling. Technically, the film is quite impressive, especially for the reported $1 million budget, which is unsurprising after what Wan & Whannell did with the $1.2 million they had for the original 'Saw.' The highest levels of the film come from those elements that don't need a massive budget: the direction, cinematography, and writing. These really were what set the film above what, by anyone else, would have been a straight-to-video-quality forgotten film. Another solid element that makes the film a step above most at its level comes from the cast, especially the work by genre veterans Barbara Hershey ('The Entity') and Lin Shaye ('Dead End'). Their acting added a much-appreciated level of depth to the fun of the film. Of all the many positive aspects of 'Insidious,' however, perhaps the most attractive is the simplest: It's actually pretty damn scary. While it doesn't contain the slow-burn creeps and chills of 'Paranormal Activity' and the like, it does contain some of the most well executed and well timed scares in a long time. Though the quantity of scares tapers off throughout the final act of the film, the first two-thirds of the film contain more than enough to satisfy any fan of the haunted house subgenre.Overall, 'Insidious' manages to be, as expected by Wan's previous work, an entertaining & original ride. It has enough humour & horror to satisfy any film-goer without focusing too heavily on one angle to make the other side feel awkward. One hope: Do not let the PG-13 rating shy you away. It actually contains more content worthy of an R-rating than 'Paranormal Activity' did.Final Verdict: 7.5/10. Highly recommended.-AP3-",Insidious
130,nitzanhavoc,"The best non-Asian Ghost Story I've seen, and one of the best Horror films in history!!!",10,1 April 2013,"This has actually been the second time I've watched this film. I remembered it was excellent and terrifying, I just didn't remember how much! Now I've seen it again so I could review and rate it, and even though I remembered the twists and the ending, it still scared the living daylight out of me!I usually start off with the build-up and the story, but in this case I'll save the best for last. The acting has been absolutely excellent by the entire cast! I've especially enjoyed the slight and subtle comic relief by Leigh Whannell and Angus Sampson as Specs and Tucker. They give a few seconds of comic atmosphere, enough to give us a breather from being absolutely terrified, and not enough to spoil the overall sensation of utter fear. Speaking of utter fear - the cinematography and sound effects have also been excellent, right on the spot for a Ghost Story Horror sub-genre. So far the scariest ghosts I've seen have been in The Ring and The Grudge, so I'm a big fan of the Japanese way of portraying a ghost. In this case - the macabre style spirits have really frightened me, especially the ""frame-cut"" shots where moment second they are expressionless and then suddenly they smile a neurotic deranged smile.Now for the best part - the story. The build up is a little slow and slightly empty of event to the point of boredom, but becomes packed with fear and thrill at just the right time, proving that patience pays off. As for the story - in one word, wow! During the past years, at least from my experience as a devout Horror freak in general and a huge fan of Ghost Stories in particular, in such films the main focus is on the haunting's physical manifestations (moving furniture, shattered light- bulbs, doors opening/closing suddenly etc.) and/or on the ghost itself. Very few screenplays have a truly genius, original and horrifying story (with the exception of The Haunting in Connecticut where the story is original as it is brilliant). In Insidious, however, the screen writing has been, in my opinion, flawless. Almost perfect. An original and simply excellent idea, using Astral Projection as the connection to the world of spirits. It's been long since I've been so impressed. I'd like to shake the hands of writer Leigh Whannell and director James Wan for creating one of the best Horror films in history.Now for some criticism, or what this time I call ""why I'm not giving Insidious a perfect 10"". Without giving any spoilers - I just want to say I was very disappointed with ""the demon"" that's mentioned towards the middle... the way it's visually portrayed is so banal, so obvious and unoriginal, and that's very obvious in such a film where the main idea is as original and superb as it is. Why use such a cheap and terrible overdone design? Simply a shame... However, that's the one and only thing I didn't like. EDIT: I've just now looked at the overall rating here, and I'm furious. So I'm going to do what I feel is right, be subjective, and rate it 10 for justice's sake. Shame on the IMDb raters for this film!!!All in all - I think Insidious just might be the best non Asian Ghost Story I've ever seen. I can't recommend it enough. I'm a grown man and an experienced Horror fan, and I don't scare easily. And yet, Insidious will give me nightmares. Don't you dare miss out on this one!",Insidious
131,rajatdahiyax,A very effective movie to horrify you!!!!!!!,7,27 August 2015,"Saw franchise veterans James Wan and Leigh Whannell team with Paranormal Activity writer/director Oren Peli to give the familiar haunted house story an exciting new twist with this tale of a family that moves into an old house and begins to suspect they are under siege from otherworldly forces when their young son inexplicably falls into a deep coma. As devoted parents Josh (Patrick Wilson) and Renai (Rose Byrne) struggle in vain to uncover the root cause of their son's condition, the stress of the situation gradually begins to take its toll on their once-strong relationship. Later, when darkness falls and specters appear to reach out for them from the shadows, the frightened parents realize they're dealing with powers beyond human comprehension.",Insidious
132,joelwatchesmovies,Spooky and engaging,7,28 October 2020,"A spooky ghost story that eventually possesses the body of a more straight forward (though still supernatural) investigative thriller, with a third act that explains the scares and establishes a clear action-plan-plot leading to the climax. It's a unique approach that works well, following up a solid first two acts filled with excellent jump scares and well-crafted atmosphere (the startling soundtrack and second act move are dreadfully effective, though the drab cinematography is less so).",Insidious
133,LloydBayer,Got me under my sheets!!,8,9 April 2012,"Either way you look at it, this is a 'love it' or 'hate it' movie. As a horror movie, you will love it for giving you the chills you expect, or, you will hate it for giving you nightmares.Having loitered in the horror genre long enough, I am always skeptical when gauging a film's alleged fright factor. This has more to do with personal expectations rather than what the film promises through pre-release trailers. When this film starts, the credits have names disintegrating into ghostly smoke. To me, this animated effect is hugely similar to the light hearted ""Scooby-Do"" episodes, or even Bill Cosby's ""Ghost Dad"". Within just a few minutes, I realized I underestimated the film's potential to induce hair raising chills. Perhaps this is director James Wan's way of saying ""Think you can handle a scary move? Wait till you see this!"" Then Wan threw me off course again. Having scripted, directed and initiated the ""Saw"" franchise, I was prepared for some blood and gore along the lines of a slasher/thriller, and no way was I expecting a true horror story. Amazingly, Wan goes on to offer a horror movie with minimal use of blood and even confines the content to a juvenile rating of PG-13. But don't let this rating misguide you.Having recently shifted to a new house, the Lamberts barely start to unpack before facing increasingly disturbing occurrences. Things take a turn for the worse when their eldest son slips into a coma after a minor fall. Doctors are baffled by Dalton's rare condition and after three months without respite, Renai and Josh bring their son home. Thinking the house to be haunted, the lamberts move again, only to realize that the problem is not the house, but that malevolent forces are using Dalton's body as a gateway into our world.Along with screen writer Leigh Whannell, Wan's success lies in the screenplay and its execution. For me, his use of the triple S formula is what really works here. At the fore is a well written script with clever homage to old school classics like ""Psycho"". Wan has also used the element of suspense, skillfully amplified by moments of deliberate silence. You just know something is going to happen, but not knowing what or when makes it all the more intense. His final S is the choice of soundtrack or score. Ominous and jolting, are the two words that come to mind. Cinematography is another area he gets right. Combined with the soundtrack, angles of filming and just the right amount of lighting, cinematography here creates the right atmosphere for the story.Aside from the technical bearing, human elements play the part to perfection. This is where most horror movies go off track, relying on effects and sound editing to do the job. As Dalton's parents, Rose Byrne and Patrick Wilson dish out some plausible portrayals. With lesser screen time but with as much prominence are Barbara Hershey and Lin Shaye in custom made roles. Although each plays vital roles in the film, Shaye has the edge as an occult specialist.A common problem with Hollywood horror movies is that every now and again, a hotshot film maker thinks he/she has what it takes to outdo the previous hotshot film maker who thinks he/she did a 'hell' of a job in scaring the audience. Think about it, how many times has a haunted house, demonic possession or a Halloween themed movie been remade? No doubt, with each re-make, the makers assume superiority over the previous releases. For Insidious, the outcome is not entirely original. Some scenes of the house are also reminiscent of Alfred Hitchcock's ""Psycho"". Even with the well written script, the ending appears to have a lot more going on than the first half. Possibly Wan and Whannell attempted to through everything they had at the audience, including a dark caricature of the ""Ghostbusters"". I am not entirely convinced if this was a right move, but I can say with certainty that if this movie is meant to scare people, people will be scared. Even if this story was not made into a movie, it would still make a compelling tale by a campfire.",Insidious
134,sunznc,"Wow! Scary, creepy film",8,26 February 2012,"Insidious does what it is supposed to do. Scare people. And it is effective at that little task. A small boy travels in his dreams but goes too far and can't get back. That leaves an empty vessel to inhabit and the tortured souls that want that vessel will do whatever they can to prevent the boy from coming back.Sound scary? It is. Some of the dialog was a bit predictable. There were three scenes that seemed rather trite. Aside from those small missteps though, this movie scared me. Very effectively I might ad.

135,Finfrosk86,Fantastic horror. Just straight up done right.,9,1 June 2015,"Let me tell you a story. A story about a couple dudes who love their horror. Me and my brother had this thing for several years, where we watched a horror movie almost every night. Some nights even two! We loved ""ghost movies"" maybe the most. So we were always on the look-out for those. Then one night we got a hold of this one, Insidious. We hadn't heard of it, but we gave it a whirl. As I said, we watched a lot, and a lot of what we watched was pretty bad. But his one, oh, it just blew us away.There are plenty of reviews on this one, so I won't go into too much detail. But the thing with Insidious, is not that it's a revolutionary movie you've never seen the likes of before. It is that it does what it tries to do, so very, very good. The stuff that happens is just cool, and creepy. (The scene with the record player and the creepy song, in particular) It just has these small details that not everyone gets. And these details are what makes this a horror classic.In a haunted house movie, a very important part is what kind of creepy stuff happens. Not everyone understands this. A common mistake is to pace it wrong. In Insidious it is very well paced, and the incidents that happen are really cool. And it is genuinely scary. Scary movies never really scare me, but this one gets pretty close.Insidious goes to show that there are still excellent horror movies to be made. And that on a budget of one million dollars? James Wan, you know your damn stuff!",Insidious
136,bob_meg,"Best haunted house film in years, just OK on the demonic possession front",7,17 July 2011,"There's a scene in ""Star 80"" where a hooker tells john Paul Schneider (Eric Roberts) why, despite his coarseness and unattractiveness, he's got to be her best lover. ""Honey, you just plain...try harder,"" she laughs. One could say the same about James Wan's films. Though sometimes falling a bit flat in their morass of fantastical elements or dissolving a bit too quickly in their frenetic camera-work, you can't deny the heart and energy he injects into his movies. It they're failures, they're not from a lack of trying.While ""Insidious"" is most definitely not a failure --- it's actually the creepiest haunted house movie I've seen in maybe thirty years --- it suffers from the More is Too Much curse of much modern horror, at least in the demonic possession realm.What keeps it going, and ultimately wins us over, is the acting and the brilliant casting choices. Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne are usually good in whatever they do, but they're spot on here as a clueless couple whose son falls victim to a mysterious coma (or so they think). In trying to find some solution to not only their son's sinister ""illness"" and to the havoc that plagues not one, but two, houses they attempt to start a life in, they bring in ghost hunter Lin Shaye and her two assistants, one played by Wan partner and (once again) screenwriter Leigh Whanell. Shay is exceptional and Barbara Hershey continues her run of good, believable supporting work since ""Black Swan.""Wan's pacing and shot set-ups are craftily constructed, devilishly executed, and the use of the discordant piano chords (""Black Christmas"" anyone?) is surprisingly effective. The problems come when the demons get a bit too ""visible"" and therefore lose a lot of their shock value. There's a bit toward the end, however, where several wax-looking figures pop up that makes you rethink that rationale...there's something in this sequence that's creepy in the extreme, but it doesn't last long.The demonic possession aspect of the film was an unfortunate combo of chestnuts I've heard before, and an overly complex explanation...it didn't do much for me and explained too much about too little. I'd have been more curious about the apparent homicides that seem to have taken place in one of the houses, though this is never expounded upon.Whatever the details prove out or don't, the overall effect of the movie is unsettling, and while I'd have preferred a bit more atmospherics, what we get is still far and away better than the usual pappy crappy pablum of films like ""The Haunting in Connecticut.""",Insidious

Insidious is and example of how a PG-13 horror film can work. It isn't a bloodbath, and doesn't constantly throw false jump scares on you.This film actually builds suspense and then hits you with something truly terrifying. Much like the Paranormal Activity Franchise. There were two really good jump scares in this film that made me scream.

138,xhidden99,Relies heavily on scary noises and weird sound editing,5,12 August 2012,"Typical haunted something or other movie: strange kid, only the mother/wife knows about it, dad/husband is of course clueless, a teacher and staying away from home as much as possible (affair with student? Who knows?), strange vaguely menacing mother in law. Also young family living in a huge house beyond any practical ability to own it. The irritating thing though is the sound. There's a crying baby practically nonstop through the first half hour and anything scary that happens is so loud and so oddly edited that it's boring.

In fact, there were several points during the film where I screamed.From the opening credits, they created an intense, haunting tension that didn't leave my body so easily. And the movie constantly feeds that tension making the movie more terrifying. The movie was great.

140,dvc5159,Pure scares,6,20 May 2011,"I think ""Scream 4"" said it best when it comes to the state of horror films nowadays. It's all either torture porn or failed reboots of famous classic horror franchises (If they decide to remake ""Jaws"" or ""The Exorcist"" I'll never forgive them), or worse, dumb them down to PG-13 tween-friendly spooks that will barely raise an eyebrow for classic horror fans.""Insidious"" does not follow today's trend. It's not gory or bloody, it does not have sex scenes or too much foul language. The PG-13 rating is justified. The movie's sole purpose, like many horror movies, is to scare the crap out of us. And it does. Brilliantly. Using good old fashioned scare tactics without making them cheap - remember the cliché where there is incidental music build up to a probably scary killer/ghost only to cop out to a scared animal or whatever? Nope. None of that here. The music comes strictly when it scares you. The non-music parts greatly serve to build the tension so high to the point that you can cut the tension with a knife. It's old school. I like old school.In fact, it's so old school with the delivery of the scares, that one may mistake the film for being stuck in between the 1970's or 1980's. Director James Wan and writer Leigh Whanell, together with producer Oren Peli, probably fashioned the film to be a homage to the great spook horror films of the past, most notably ""Poltergiest"", with bits of ""The Exorcist"", ""The Shining"" and Peli's own ""Paranormal Activity"" thrown in for very good measure.A script which is a homage to other films can either sink or swim. This one swims, because Whanell uses the classic scare elements and removes the clichés. Wan directs with caution, going mostly against audiences' expectations. The actors play their role straight as per the crew - Rose Byrne and Patrick Wilson are very good in their roles, and Lin Shaye is a bit creepy as the medium who helps them. With the music by Joseph Bishara effectively eerie at many parts and some truly spooky production design and camera work, Wan's tense direction propels a homage script into their own - a great, solid horror flick that does exactly what it's supposed to do - scare - brilliantly.Look at the horror film directors of the past. John Carpenter. Wes Craven. Tobe Hooper. The granddaddy of horror Alfred Hitchcock. Even Sean Cunningham has a cult following. Does anyone familiar with horror films remember names like Samuel Bayer or Nelson McCormick? Granted, Alexandre Aja and Neil Marshall has done some fairly solid stuff, yet Eli Roth to be honest tries too hard. James Wan isn't up there with the greats yet, but if he keeps up this old-school trend without copping out, he just might very well be. I'm just saying.This is great stuff for a horror film. This was how scary movies were made in the past, this is how it still should be.Overall rating: 80/100",Insidious

142,evening1,Surprised how bad this was,2,18 September 2019,"I've never been a fan of haunted-house stuff, so I wasn't expecting much here, and I wasn't surprised at the mediocrity of this film.This is a stupid story about a couple whose older son is able to ""astrally project"" so that he wanders around the spiritual world while his body lies in a coma at home. The only way to free this kid is to send his father into the ether to retrieve him. Er, OK.I gave this film two stars, rather than one, because it succeeded in producing a little tension as spooky things started to happen around the house. These occurrences are more creepy than scary and they get old fast. After a while they are downright dumb. A red-faced character that resembles a devil? I've seen scarier images in a coloring book.A big problem with this movie is that it tries to be funny amidst all this ridiculousness and fodder. This does no more than create cognitive dissonance and irritation in the viewer.I'd never have sought this film out, but it was screened as part of a horror-film class that I'm taking. Though presented as a good example of sound artistry, I didn't find ""Insidious"" compelling even on that front.What does it say about our culture that a movie like this spawned three sequels? Now that's something to be scared about!PS: Don't be fooled by the appearance of Barbara Hershey in this film's cast.

143,Bloodwank,"Decidedly underwhelming, surprisingly popular spook schlock opus",4,2 May 2011,"As of writing Insidious is the most profitable film so far of 2011 and basks in the praise of genre fans. Rarely have I been so dissatisfied by a film so feted, and I'm a pretty easy guy to please. Not to mention I dig haunted house films anyway and have a lot of time for the era of schlock that Insidious taps into (that would be the blessed 80's). But somehow, from start to finish Insidious fell flat for me at almost every stage. A family find themselves the target of mysterious and menacing spooks after one son winds up in a coma after a ladder accident. From here the film moves into overdrive, serving up boo scares with loud and obvious scoring by the numbing, repetitive barrel full with a saddening minimum of actual creeps (baby monitor put to good use). The restless dead seem to have a lot of fun popping up, or out or in and props to them if they are indeed having fun as it must be pretty lame not passing on, but the constant activity combined with lack of serious threat or greater purpose (I didn't exactly expect a probing gaze into the traumatised mentality of parents post tragedy but the film is remarkably thin stuff) makes for a hollow experience lacking menace. Plus pretty much only one is designed with any flair and it gets underused. The living of the film are slightly more effective, though still flawed Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne offer sturdy performances as the leads, they never summon much in the way of drama but are never less than watchable. Barbara Hershey is fine value as a helpful mother though, and Lin Shaye makes for an endearing psychic. Things eventually build to a modestly entertaining climax in which the film finally achieves some sense of the unusual and a bit of style (though the direction is pretty dodgy) and a rather cool capper that deserved a better build up. Altogether though the film came across to me as nothing more than a haunted house fairground attraction with less verve or humour (an effect aided considerably by the occasional shrieks of my fellow cinema goers, shrieks I rather hope were intended humorously) at around an hour and a half or so an overstretched and tedious experience. I seem to be one of the few dissenters on this one so perhaps my thoughts ought to be taken with a grain of salt, but in no way do I recommend this one unless you have a stack of viewing aids and some buddies on hand to make a laugh of the watching. 4/10 from me.",Insidious
144,Meven_Stoffat,"A return to what horror really is, and should be, about!",10,1 April 2011,"Insidious... wow, what can I say.It starts with the title... what does it mean? It rings through your head. Insidious... insidious... it's a fascinating word. It means ""Proceeding in a gradual, subtle way, but with harmful effects"". One should wonder, ""why is it called Insidious?"" I was excited about this film from the moment James Wan announced it. I am a fan of him and Leigh Whannell, and have been since Saw. Dead Silence was scary as hell and Death Sentence was pure fun. When I saw the trailer, I was so excited, and anticipated opening day.This film will grab you right from the opening shots and its opening titles. James Wan knows how to set the mood for an experience that will fill you with fear and dread, and Insidious is proof. The cinematography is excellent and atmospheric... boasting a mostly muted and gray look, Wan's visual style sure is eye-catching and creepy.The film's plot revolves around a family of five- A married couple, Josh and Renai, a teacher and musician and their children. Having just moved into a new home, they seem to have a perfect sense of belonging. However, one night, the eldest child, Dalton, bumps his head after falling off the ladder and is soon in a comatose state.Three months later, creepy stuff begins to happen. Ghosts can be seen. Break-ins occur. They move to Josh's mother's place, but even that doesn't help. Soon, they find out it's Dalton that's haunted- not the house, as he is stuck in a realm called The Further!!! Insidious is creepy and good fun. If you're expecting jump scares every 5 minutes, you will be disappointed. This movie is largely tension based, and jump scares are minimal. Wan brings back what horror is about- being SCARED. To feel fear... to dread what's coming next.The performances are great too- Wilson is excellent, and so is Rose Byrne. Also turning in a good performance is Leigh Whannell- undoubtedly the show stealer- as the geeky and hilarious Specs. He and his buddy Tucker provide the comic relief (the flashlight scene was hilarious!!!).In short, Insidious is a success. Wan and Whannell clearly love being scared as much as we do, and it shows. To James Wan: Touche. Thanks so much for showing what horror is about!!!",Insidious
145,ExpendableMan,Did Charlie Kelly write this?,4,28 June 2015,"There's an episode of ""It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia"" called ""The Nightman Cometh"" where one of the characters makes a misguided attempt at seducing a woman by writing a musical. The show revolves around a young boy who gets his soul stolen and dragged off to another dimension by the titular Nightman, a Demon with slick black hair and cats eyes who hides in the shadows. It's not very well written, poorly acted and inevitably, winds up being a total disaster.Why is this relevant you may ask? Well because the plot to 'Insidious' is remarkably similar. Sure, it's not a musical and the acting is generally rather good, but the story of a young boy dropping into an inexplicable coma during the night because of a Demon with slick black hair and cats eyes dragging him off to another dimension is uncomfortably close to Charlie Kelly's ham- fisted calamity. That being said, if you're not familiar with said comedy you might still find 'Insidious' intriguing, but only if you've not seen any horror films before. It does a pretty good job of setting up the tension in the early going, but soon loses it's way once you realise that it doesn't have many original ideas. It might not be about a haunted house, but aside from the fact there's one point where the protagonists move, it sure plays out like one. Considering the Demons spend most of the film doing little more than the occasional cackling or running past an open door, it's also hard to feel scared by them.In fairness though, 'Insidious' isn't awful. The early scenes work quite well, the interplay between Rose Byrne and Patrick Wilson does make them seem like a convincing married couple and the two bickering paranormal researchers are actually quite entertaining. However, it just feels like it was put together by a committee who wanted bits of 'The Amityville Horror' and 'Poltergeist' stitched together. By the time the finale comes round you'll be humming a song about the Dayman, fighter of the Nightman, guardian of the sun, master of Karate and friendship for everyone.",Insidious
146,ebossert,"Like Most 21st Century American Horror, It Goes For Cheap Scares",4,20 July 2011,"There's a guy in my office that occasionally hides under my work desk and yells ""BOO"" when I return from the restroom. Sometimes he jumps out from the coat closet near the front door, or hides behind the wall adjacent to the office kitchen. Every time he uses the same lame ""BOO"" scream because he's too stupid to properly construct an effective scare. It worked the first few times but now it's totally worthless. He can't scare me. I, on the other hand, will occasionally hide behind his door in the morning before he arrives. His office lights are usually off and the lighting is dim. He'll walk into his office, feel someone's presence, turn around and see a shadow near the door. Is it a part of his imagination or is it real? He squints his eyes for a few seconds and then notices that someone is actually there. It scares the crap out of him every time, and I don't even need to scream ""BOO!"" Ironically, sometimes when I don't do it he'll stop by my office and say, ""Man, I thought I saw you this morning."" This very basic difference between amateur shock tactics and well-constructed sequences of terror is something that 21st Century American filmmakers ignore with reckless abandon. In case you hadn't noticed, the American horror industry has sucked for quite some time, and one major reason is that they almost always go for the cheapest, laziest routes to producing scares. In the case of Insidious, it's jump scares supplemented with 100-decibel piano/violin BOOMs. If Insidious limited itself to 2 or 3 such moments (or even 4 or 5), then it could have saved enough room for more mature, expertly crafted horror elements. Unbelievably, Insidious tosses in approximately 20 jump scares, an unacceptable descent into unprecedented laziness. The condensed nature of the jumps falls prey to the law of diminishing returns. It would be like the guy at my office jumping in front of me and yelling ""BOO"" every 3 minutes. It quickly becomes a parody of itself.Brian Salisbury from ""Film School Rejects"" makes some good points in his review of Insidious, so I'd like to quote him here: ""Seriously, horror filmmakers: put a moratorium on jump scares. I know everyone and their brother is using jump scares as a counterattack against increasingly desensitized audiences, but it's time to give up the ghost (pun only slightly intended). I got sick and tired of something popping up like Jack-in-the-Box every five seconds obscuring my vision from the much more interesting, and far scarier, story going on behind it. Jump scares are the junk food of horror films – providing only superficial and extremely temporary sensory nourishment. Soon enough, your brain is hungry again for that fear response and jump scares are about as substantial as eating a box of Twinkies on Thanksgiving Day. When you watch the Oscars and the category of Achievement in Sound Mixing comes up (you know, when you normally make a trip to the bathroom), you may ponder on the value of a film's sound mixer or sound designer. Five minutes into Insidious, you will understand the dire necessity of these artists if only by virtue of the fact that we're subjected to their spectacular failures for 90 minutes. Every apparition carries with it its own deafening shriek and every jump scare is heralded with an explosion of disharmonious (read: eardrum-shredding) violins. It seems to be operating under the same delusion as Drag Me to Hell that loud = scary. But, along with jump scares, incessant loud noises are the charlatans of fright. We are not infants, so please refrain from resorting to the same tactics that terrify barely cognitive life forms."" That sums things up nicely. The praise that Insidious has earned for it's cheap scare tactics should be concerning for fans of the genre, because a transition from the recent torture/gore trend towards jump scare compilations isn't much of a progression for the pitiable American horror industry. Take away the 100-decibel piano/violin BOOMs and almost none of the jumps will work on your mainstream cinephile. (And by ""work"" I'm using the generous term ""startle"", which is probably the laziest way to scare someone.) The storyline is stupid, the acting is mediocre at best, the dialogue ranges from decent to lame, and the dramatic elements are limp. The only true positive is the fairly brisk pacing that keeps things from getting unbearably boring.Despite everyone I know complaining about my biased preference for Japanese and South Korean horror, it's pretty damn obvious that my fellow Americans are simply too incompetent to construct long-sustained sequences of terror, produce dense atmosphere, develop interesting psychological/philosophical elements, use ambiguity properly, patiently utilize deliberate pacing to build tension, or supplement horror with good story lines and characters. If Insidious is the creme de la creme of modern American horror, then it's time to write an epitaph.",Insidious

148,Quebec_Dragon,Not as insidious and scary as it could have been,6,1 July 2012,"The trailer is very good and makes you want to watch the movie, although it spoils a few things, so better to avoid if you can. The first half (in the first house) is superbly done: building up suspense, making you unsure what to expect and basically making you focus on the corners of the screens (away from the characters) to anticipate what might appear. This ""where's Waldo game"" starts in the credits where some of pictures have something that shouldn't be there or moving. Scares relied on creepy sounds, shadows, inanimate objects moving and quick glimpses of human shapes and faces where they shouldn't be. So, traditional stuff, but it was creepy, and I was buying it. Then not long after the start of the second half, something weird happened as the more things got supernatural, the less I was involved, the less I was unnerved to the point of being quite calm near the end. That big problem, especially for a horror film supposed to be climaxing, might have been caused by 3 possible things: the introduction of comic relief nerd exorcists, the shift from haunted house story to possession story and showing too much of the ""entities"" (as in lingering too long).Speaking of which, some of the most memorable parts involved a red-faced ""demon"" appearing quickly where it shouldn't be and as a shadow later on. Near the end, the more you saw of him, the less disturbing he became, showing the limitations of his design. So we have a two-headed beast film here: the first half of the movie, scarier, more subtle, insidious even, would be a 8 for remarkable; the second half, flashier, less scary yet still entertaining, would be a 4 for slightly below average. The acting from the family was decent. The acting from the paranormal investigators, especially the old woman, sometimes veered close to caricature. Jump scares weren't cheap, false alert ones and some clichés were intentionally avoided (as heard in the extras). There was some blood but not anything gory or physically disgusting. The Blu-Ray extras, all put together, are a paltry 20 minutes long. If you like that kind of film, you could be doing worse than renting this one, but I wouldn't buy it sight unseen.Rating: 6 out of 10 (good)",Insidious
149,doorsscorpywag,Star Wars meets Kingpin!,3,24 April 2011,Some decent bits at the start but soon becomes Poltergeist and then Star Wars when that bloke with the red face who was a Sith turns up with for some unknown reason Tiny Tim. The ending descended into farce when after getting in the Excorsist for one scene they sent for the Ghostbusters who called in the landlady from Kingpin and all Hell broke loose for the last 20 minutes as the cast re-enacted scenes from Poltergeist but could not afford a rope and instead just made do. Then the guys who were in Michael Jackson's Thriller made an appearance and we got a shock ending that was obvious and silly. The most frightening part of Insidious is that we will likely see a part 2. I am not sure whether it was meant to be a horror film or a comedy and can't really be bothered to care.,Insidious
150,kikiboo_8,Really good one,10,19 July 2021,"It's fun, has multilayered creepiness to it - not just the admittedly frequent jump scares, but also very creepy music, and exploring the darker side of the unknown. It's no mystery that the astral projection is very much real. Which makes it even more scary. Then add a bit of demons, a whole separate yet horrible world to the story and voila! You get a really fun and creepy movie. In addition to that, characters are lovable, relatable and real. So many of you here say they're bland, stupid or cowardly. Idiots. I'd absolutely love to see you handle the situation any better than they have. No can do? Thought so. The movie doesn't get as much love or recognition as it certainly deserves.",Insidious
151,MikesIDhasbeentaken,A genuinely scary horror film,6,30 April 2011,"how often does a film come along that is Actually scary? so many films try, yet all they end up offering is a couple of jumps and maybe a bit of gore. So films now days maybe 'jumpy' and disgusting, making you want to turn your head away, but it's not the same as being actually scared.There have been moments, the end of 'the ring' (original) being a stand out moment. But Insidious really did do the job.OK i was alone, at night, with the lights out. Which helps. but the first hour of the film might well be my favourite hour of horror film ever. it's a shame it kind of turns in a circus (although an extremely frightening one) towards the end, it all of a sudden became like a weird comedy.But i think this is the intention. It's everything i had hoped 'drag me to hell' would be, straight out of the 80's, as cheesy as ever, but very scary.watch this film if you like horror films and have been looking for one to scare you as much as 'nightmare on elm street' did when you were a child.

152,Jerique,One of the scariest movies of all time!,9,12 April 2011,"Insidious comes from two of my all-time favourite filmmakers: James Wan and Leigh Whannell. Nevermind the fact that this film is on a $1 million budget and the cast is filled with no big names. This movie will blow your mind.Keep this all in mind as you watch this horror masterpiece. It takes you on an intense ride that will have you squirming in your seat. It is probably going to be the best horror film of 2011, and one of the top ten of the year, as well. It's just so damn good.It starts off showing a family unpacking boxes in their new home, when strange things start happening making me think of The Haunting in the Connecticut. It quickly dives into depression as the son Dalton falls into what the doctors deem as a coma...but not really. But the strange things don't stop but instead grow more intense. Even when the family changes environments by moving to another house, the family is plagued with the spirits in the house.It doesn't follow the same set-up-pay-off format as Paranormal Activity, and nor does it follow the disturbing nature of Dead Silence. Instead, it combines these two elements to give us the psychological aspect, but while also giving us jump scenes.I lept from my seat at one point because this movie is scary. It doesn't have any bloody scenes but it is not necessary here. It doesn't have any of those scenes like Paranormal Activity, but instead makes it's own scare scenes using lighting and effects. It is truly a freaky film by most of what happens in the the second half of the movie.Perhaps the creepiest thing in the movie is the song that is sung by Tiny Tim. It occurs briefly twice in the movie, but both times send some serious shivers down your spine. It chills me and although this movie freaked me out more than any movie has, I would love to see it again. Seriously, folks, if you haven't yet seen Insidious and want a good scare and want a good film to see for the early 2011, go see it.",Insidious

The music its perhaps the best part about the film, its such a great score and while I do like the movie I think this music deserves a better film, it sounds like the soundtrack to a modern day horror masterpiece and Insidious its far from a masterpiece but its not bad in any way.

The writers are too busy trying to dodge the clichés of The exorcist and their previous Paranormal Activity that they do not realize how out of wack their story is. The story is so far fetched in the second half that the horror does not even work. Horror is about believability, taking something audiences can relate to and expanding on the concept to scare them. Director James Won pulls across little believability and little stylistics to make up for it and the result is lacking. I cannot pan it due to its desire to be original but I cannot like it either for the absurdity of the plot elements. Film buffs should move on.",Insidious

Insidious is your typical story;a family move in to a house and are haunted by evil demons,BUT,this has a very interesting story and its,not gonna spoil,but turns out to be a kind of bloodline thing with the demons. Lin Shaye stars in this and does a brilliant role but sadly as we all know,dies in the ending. Insidious has a very good story but by now,that story is just worn out cause lots of people have used it now;family haunted and it turns out to be a bloodline thing between father and son'. Insidious is a awesome horror film,good story,good acting from Patrick Wilson(Conjuring) and Lin Shaye(There's Something About Mary)",Insidious
159,FairlyAnonymous,Heavily Overrated as far as scares go,5,10 December 2011,"Insidious was one of those movies I heard everyone talking about saying, ""So scary!"" or ""Scariest movie I have ever seen!"" even someone who claimed they were a horror film fanatic had this movie over the exorcist! I can tell you that this movie is not scary... at least to me. But it is jumpy.I think audiences now a days do not know the difference between horror and terror. According to Devendra Varma in The Gothic Flame (1966): The difference between Terror and Horror is the difference between awful apprehension and sickening realization: between the smell of death and stumbling against a corpse.Insidious is full of ""horror"" but it uses a LOT of jump scares. This movie is very jumpy, and uses cheap scares about every second. The only problem is that you can tell when a jump scare is going to happen except for about two scenes. I will admit there are some good concepts in this movie and the good ideas start to fold at the end of the movie, but the beginning of the movie just isn't so good. The movie uses the loud violin screeches way too much. Really the violin is so loud in this movie that you can't hear anything else.The plot follows a family in what is seemingly a haunted house after their son goes into a coma after falling from a ladder.. Creepy noises, bloody hand prints, and other strange stuff occur. They leave the house and move, but even stranger stuff occurs. It ends up that the kid is actually trying to be possessed by many demons/spirits and the same time. There isn't a real main bad monster, or bad guy, but there is one that appears frequently and looks like Darth Maul meets Freddy Kruger.I will admit that the red faced demon is pretty sweet looking, and hearing tip toe through the tulips was great! I actually sang to it really loud while watching the movie since I know the song well. I guess for some people the song made the movie scarier, but for me it made it lighter.The movie has some LOL moments where the dialog is just dreadful, but that is mainly during the first half of the movie. The second half has much better acting and dialog. Scary scenes were ruined by some bad dialog.Overall the movie tried something interesting but kind of failed in having genuine terror.",Insidious

162,RockPortReview,The Best Horror Movie of 2011!,9,4 April 2012,"Insidious is the new horror movie from James Wan and Leigh Whannell who brought us the original ""Saw"" movie and the 2007 movie ""Dead Silence"" which was also reviewed on this blog. Insidious is the best scary movie of 2011 so far. It is not gory and bloody like ""Saw"" but returns to the basics how to really scare you in a deep and authentic way, with out resorting to cheap violence.Insidious is a story that that crosses two popular horror sub genres; the haunted house and demonic possession. With this film director James Wan has created some of the creepiest and nightmare inducing images to be seen in a long time. Along with the musical score by Joseph Bishara (who also acts as the main villain) they have created a truly frightening film.The Lambert family has just moved into you typical dark and foreboding new house. The doors creak, the attic is cold and dark, and things just don't feel right as the family of five starts settling in. When Dalton, the younger of the two boys, has a mishap while exploring the attic he seems fine but doesn't wake up the next morning. After a trip to the emergency room, he checks out to be perfectly healthy but in a sort of coma. Over the next few days the mother, played by Rose Byrne, is freaked out by the strange things going on inside the house (think ""Poltergeist""). When she is attacked by a ghost, she begs her husband Josh (Patrick Wilson) to move. They do, to smaller and happier looking place. But the ghosts and spirits seem to have followed them. They have a paranormal team investigate and find out that ""The house is not haunted, it's your son"". This plot twist and how the rest of the movie unfolds has alienated some viewers, but if you've come this far, you might as well strap in and enjoy the ride.Dalton is stuck in and other worldly dimension called the ""further"", a sort of purgatory for demons and lost souls. Lin Shaye plays Elise a paranormal medium who seeks to bring back Dalton to his earthly body before it is taken over. The premise is no doubt out there, but the filmmakers know this and really go for it. There are not cheap scares in this movie, no cats jumping out of the dark, no flocks of birds hiding in the shadows. They've created a roster of truly frightening baddies in the Old Woman, the Lipstick-Face demon, and the Doll Face girls. What's more amazing is that this film was made for only one and a half million dollars and grossed over 58 million in theaters.The movie was also produced by the ""Paranormal Activity"" people, but ""Insidious"" actually delivers on the scares. Insidious is now available on DVD, Blu Ray, On Demand, Red Box, and probably more. So see it today!",Insidious
163,isantistao,A Truly Great Horror Film,10,4 November 2021,"There is little more that I can say about this horror film than it is a truly great one. Thoroughly enjoyable and well done. An amazingly well written story, well acted and executed and produced. Ticks all the boxes on what you want in a horror film, and with even a little bit of comic relief in some parts that adds to the enjoy-ability. And unlike many it is actually scary. And with a pretty serious cliffhanger ending that just puts the final cherry on top. And for all of those reasons I believe this movie to be a perfect ten, and I think you'll agree.",Insidious
164,colinrgeorge,Spiders Among Spider Rings,6,6 April 2011,"Hollywood horror films draw from a grab bag of assorted Halloween party favors, but amidst all the cheap plastic spider rings, director James Wan inserts a tarantula or two for good measure. His latest, ""Insidious,"" takes a see-what-sticks approach that can sometimes be as frustrating as it is refreshing, but in a cinematic climate where scary movies are becoming an increasingly on-rails experience, every goose bump is worth its weight in gold (and I imagine it adds up).""Insidious"" has plenty of genuinely chilling moments, and makes better than average use of the oft maligned ""jump scare."" The technique doesn't always deliver the desired impact, but that such instances are uneven in effectiveness is in a way an incredible asset. Emotionally, we're on our toes. Wan puts convention in a blender and the audience is often left reeling from the topsy-turvy inertia. That familiar horror guardrail is gone and we're left groping in the dark.Taking a page from Sam Raimi (not to mention title work more than a little reminiscent of his 2009 flick ""Drag Me to Hell""), Wan keeps us off-balance with unpredictable emotionality. Not every bizzaro changeup he pitches lands squarely in the strike zone—a bumbling pair of paranormal investigators falls flat on the comedy front—but by constantly upsetting our expectations, ""Insidious"" picks a cerebral scab and burrows under our skin. A particularly inspired and disorienting soundtrack choice is the use of Tiny Tim's ""Tiptoe Through the Tulips,"" proving perhaps definitively that nothing is more terrifying than a ukulele.Little unconventional details help too, and with credit to ""Saw"" screen writing veteran Leigh Whannell, ""Insidious"" makes some subtly interesting choices. For once, our parental protagonists, Josh and Renai Lambert (Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne), are not the progenitors of an only child. Creepy kids are a genre staple, but by diffusing that cliché with siblings, Whannell opens himself to some less-traveled roads. Unfortunately, one of his most glaring oversights is underplaying that idea; in the inferior second half of the film, the other offspring essentially disappear.Or take, for instance, the critic's ace-in-the-hole: ""Why don't they just leave the house?"" Like in ""Paranormal Activity,"" Whannell explicitly explains that the demonic presence is attached to his characters rather than their homestead, but they hightail it out of there all the same. I can't immediately recall another example of haunted protagonists rationally raising stakes in the middle of the second act.It may seem insignificant, but it makes a big difference in a genre as delicate as horror, where the element of surprise is everything. If ""Insidious"" were comprised entirely of offbeat innovations, it would be a perfect film. But just as often, Whannell lets convention get the better of him, or he piles on too many sub-genres—what starts off in ""Poltergeist"" country winds up closer to ""A Nightmare on Elm Street,"" if you can imagine that. The disparate elements clash and complement each other in equal measure.Spearheaded by Wan and Whannell, the ""Saw"" franchise pushed horror in a new direction. ""Insidious"" nudges it back. Inspired by classic seventies spook-outs, the filmmakers crafted what feels like Hollywood's most synonymous effort in years, imperfect though it may be. There are no hidden camera gimmicks, and absent is the also oft maligned ""torture porn"" the pair popularized eight years prior. Instead, expect to be treated to the unexpected. True, the beats and ""Boos!"" are familiar as can be, but when ""Insidious"" jumps the rails, it's one hell of a ride.",Insidious

166,jdring2007,compelling tension and unorthodox horror movie acts mixed with typical tropes create an interesting experience,8,20 September 2021,"First and foremost, the concept of The Further was what really drew me into liking this movie, or at least remembering it as something special, and it's not a facet introduced until the third act. It's a unique plot device executed very well, used intelligently without being overwhelming. Secondly, easily the most standout scene for me, even after three viewings (this review written after the third), is ""the daytime scene."" It was the first time I'd watched a horror movie where I was genuinely unnerved while the sun's shining. Although not in-your-face horror, the subtlety of the terror in that scene, and the overall palpable tension, of course built up beforehand, was especially effective. That said, one thing that nearly ruined the whole experience for me was the annoyingly strident music, but after the overdramatic opening I should've expected as much; and it's not constant, fortunately. This in mind, there's something to be appreciated about the strange aesthetic approach they took in this movie, for the demon, which I can imagine might either repel or attract viewers. Still, it's kept at a bare minimum in the first half, which is basically a thorough rise in tension. Meanwhile the acting (namely Patrick Wilson, Rose Byrne, and eventually Lin Shaye) and direction is solid, which Conjuring fans would come to know and love even more, as James Wan proceeded to use Patrick Wilson in more movies. Overall it's a solid modern horror flick with some great scares and creepiness while still following seemingly unavoidable tropes and gimmicks.",Insidious
167,DustinRahksi,It was okay.,5,8 January 2013,"These are my brief thoughts. With all the love people give this movie, it attracted my attention, luckily I found it on sale and bought it. Surprisingly there wasn't to many scares, but there was a lot of suspense and creepy moments. Nothing I lost sleep over.The plot was just fine, nothing mind blowing. The characters were not very interesting, but they served their purpose. The music was few and far between. You either get loud screeching or upbeat songs that the ghosts listen to. Why do they listen to music, who knows. Now we get into the demons. First we got this Darth maul/devil which looks like a generic picture of a devil, you can tell they weren't too creative. Then we got smiling ghosts/demons that a can't help but smile right back, I mean they look so stupid, you can't stop yourself from laughing. And the scene where the lead actress get's licked by the ghost just looks ridiculous. They pretty much failed to scare me with the supernatural beings.The film wasn't great, but it is worth at least one watch. When it comes to smiling demons I think I'll stick with The Evil Dead.",Insidious
168,Fields201,Insidious Activity,7,1 April 2011,"Just before paying for my ticket to see Insidious, I heard a scream come from the woman at the ticket booth. She screamed pretty loud. Looking up to see what happened, I noticed someone scared her from behind. As I paid for my ticket, I told the woman, ""I hope I scream like that when I see this movie."" Of course, she laughed.I can't say that I screamed during Insidious, but some people in the audience did. I must admit I jumped a few times, with help from a rather loud audio when the jump scare happens. There are even suspenseful moments to get your heart racing. For the first half of the movie, I knew I was in for something great.Notice I said the ""first half of the movie.""When the movie begins, it reminded me of one of those old, 1970's horror films with a scary sight, large words of the title appearing on screen, and the classic shrills from the violin as if to say ""BOO!"" At this point, I felt the film was trying too hard but I was giving it a chance since it just started.Then we are introduced to the family moving in, enter Josh and Renai (Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrnes) who have two boys and a baby girl. They just moved into a creepy looking house that looks right at home in Amityville, and like Paranormal Activity: strange things happen at night. Things take a turn for the worse when their son Dalton falls into a coma and the doctors have no idea why. For three months they keep him on oxygen, and the other boy claims he walks at night. This is where they get strange visits from ghosts and the situation gets so bad, they did something the couple in the first Paranormal Activity should have done.... move. But then, things get worse, to the point where they call in a paranormal investigation team. It is there they discover what's really going on, and why Darth Maul is running around in their house.As I said before, the first half was great. The second half gets so outlandish and weird (though still implementing some good ideas) that it took me out of the movie. Even still, it was like the film lost sight of their main characters. In the first half of the film, we see Renai is struggling to become a musician, while Josh is teaching in school. But as the film goes on, it just seems like the two of them are just going through the motions, losing track of those plot points and just focusing on the entities and that stupid story they are trying to tell. Also, besides the use of the baby monitor, I didn't get why the baby was needed in the film. It didn't help with the plot device, only to serve for a couple of scares. This may be a result of some lazy writing, and the film itself could just be going through the motions.One last criticism that needs to be addressed and I know I am not the first one to point this out: Darth Maul. I can't help but to think that the main ghost that's causing all of this looks suspiciously like Darth Maul. I was waiting for the double lightsaber to come out. This isn't something I should be thinking about when I'm watching a horror film!Insidious is a hit and miss. It's an enjoyable experience, but it will only be enjoyable one time. It won't have the lasting appeal as some of the better horror films out there. If anyone is thinking of going to see this one, by all means go see it. It definitely has its moments. Unfortunately those moments are a one scare wonder.",Insidious
169,mirwais-orbit,"Cheap, cheesy, disappointing.",3,24 May 2011,"Insidious could have been a great horror film. Everything happens very well in the movie from the beginning to its half. The main character doesn't take long to realize that her house is haunted, her husband tries not to believe it although he knows that something wrong is happening. Very obvious things happen, but are treated as ""obvious"" and not always as a ""cliché"" and that was interesting because the characters discover what is happening and do what must be done to find solutions instead of dying one by one or keep the whole movie discussing with the Catholic Church. But when complex explanations start to appear justifying the mysteries, all the good qualities expressed earlier in the movie are brought to the drain. The film then turns into a B horror movie with infant arguments for a subject that could have been very interesting if well developed. The makeup is more laughable than frightening. If fresh makeup was supposed to be frighting, for sure Insidious would be a blast! I was very curious about this movie, it took a lot of my attention in the beginning but in the end I was regretting seen it because its disappointing.",Insidious
170,FKDZ,Darth Maul's early days in acting.,3,20 September 2021,"I don't have a lot of positives to say about this. Another one of James Wan's works that excels at throwing a disgusting amount of loud noises at you to make you jump without actually any frightening imagery.The only redeeming factor is the directing, which is done well, in Wan's style. The acting was okay at best. Really mundane performances though all around. The movie has the typical Wan terrible color grading, everything is bleak and grey. Also the movie is much too long for its own good. It drags and is one of the few movies I actually needed to skip through because it was so slow and boring.The story... well it's something I guess. It has no depth at all. It's just whatever a dream world but there are no rules. Nothing makes sense. How the movie ends is just laughable, it's typical horror movie style but it makes no sense after what the dad just did in the dream world.This sounds like a huge rant, and I guess it is, I expected more especially after some reviews and it's general score. The monsters are blegh, nothing is scary. The only scary thing is how loud the next noise will be.Also this movie is INTENTIONALLY edited to have very low dialog audio and generally is lacking and sort of ambience just so you turn your speakers up and get ear-blasted with a loud jumpscare noise.",Insidious
171,blacklist-1,"A bit creepy and well made, but completely bonkers, forgettable and uninvolving.",6,2 May 2011,"The horror film Insidious when I looked at the IMDb rating of 7.3 on here I became very sceptical, thinking due to three previous film experiences that it was highly overrated. The films I refer to (two not being horrors, but still overrated were The Fighter and the hideously bad Thor). The third film which was a horror and had a rating of 7.4 was The Descent, which for me without a doubt is one of the worst horror films in years as I wouldn't even classify as that because it was so bad. So I settled down to Insidious with cautious optimism. I'm afraid to say again like The Descent, Insidious for me has been quite overrated, but it is not as out of proportion and this was much more entertaining than The Descent.The story itself has some promise with demons and spirits which is nothing new. But there are some creepy moments throughout the film when these spirits appear with unending ease, which stayed in my mind for a while during the film. The atmosphere created by director James Wan is done well to an extent with some impressive make up and special effects and his effective use of sound, though mainly this in the first forty minutes. The acting too (though not amazing) was reasonable for a horror. But really the film lost heart after about forty five minutes as it became more and more silly where I just laughed at certain scenes (and I'm glad from looking at the audience reviews on here I wasn't the only one) as it didn't look at all that real. When they camera does an extreme close up of like the demon, it looked like some ridiculous attempt from a child at making a Halloween costume. The thing is Insidious does market itself as a serious horror and me laughing at it is what disrepute's it to being better than it could be for me. It is completely bonkers with a stupid ending, but strangely in a way it being silly made it more enjoyable in a goofy sort of way.But by the end the film had lost it's chilling atmosphere and was half horror and comedy and though it was entertaining, it didn't remotely scare me and was uninvolving and forgettable. It's nothing special but is enjoyable enough to watch and it passes the time and is more entertaining than The Descent.",Insidious

The so-called 'torture-porn' horror. There is also an obsession with remaking or 're-booting' films to try and make money from the horror film franchises, like the recent Nightmare On Elm Street. However, what Insidious proves, is that by writing something clever and serious, you can make a new and scary horror film.The key to the success of Insidious is that on the whole the cast play it straight. The cast led by Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne are all good. It helps that the script, written by Leigh Whannell, while in truth not the most original, taking elements from films such as Poltergeist, it does enough with these elements to work on it's on level. It also helps having James Wan directing. Although still best known for making the first (and best) Saw film, he has made some interesting films since, Death Sentence being one, and Dead Silence which has a similar feel to Insidious.While Wan may not be a high profile director, he does an excellent job here. He creates an atmosphere of tension throughout, including some excellent scares in daylight, a rare feat indeed! And while he does use the 'jump' scare technique, it works very well. Even at the climax of the film, which is a little predictable, he stages a chilling ending.There are faults. The ending does go a bit overboard, loosening the tension created up till that point, and a couple of paranormal investigators bring some unwanted comic relief.But these are minor issues. Whannell and Wan have created a truly unsettling horror film, and one that pretty much succeeds on every level. It takes a lot to scare me when I go see a film. The only ones that can, are those that create the right atmosphere. Most films don't manage that. This does easily. And it did scare me.This is easily one of the best recent horror films I've seen and I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys being scared.",Insidious
174,tapio_hietamaki,A good-looking horror-thriller that plunges into fantasy,6,29 November 2013,"Have you noticed how many horror films start with an ordinary family moving into a new house? We get to know the parents and the kids (usually at least one teenager) and their problems and dynamics, and we see how they have trouble adjusting to their new home. They hear weird noises and see weird things like objects changing place or doors closing. The tension increases and we prepare ourselves for something scary. And then the film's original story takes it from there.Insidious is no different, in fact the beginning of the film is so conventional that I was sure there has to be something more, something surprising. Well... there is, once Insidious gets into gear it does offer some twists, but not exactly like you'd expect.Here's the big spoiler: this film is not scary. The first half is somewhat scary and it seems like the ending might be hellishly frightening, but it's not. It's funny. The film starts realistic but turns into fantasy horror, pretty much like the show Supernatural. There are comic sidekicks and slapstick action sequences, and the plot becomes very fantastical.The humor is pretty subtle and understated so the film doesn't really jump the shark, it's just a pretty startling change in atmosphere.The acting is alright and there are some cool, dark visuals.",Insidious
175,utahman1971,PG-13 says it!,1,3 June 2011,"Not voting because I won't see it. I don't understand how anyone can say PG-13 horror are horror. If no gore then its a immediately a thriller not horror. Horror in definition has gore. So this is not an officially a horror movie.Stop with the horror PG-13 lies. I watch so many of these false claimed horror flicks, that I only see horror if its R or Unrated now. Sorry, these knock offs are about as good as Poltergeist, which is now not really scary anymore. So people out claiming this is scary is weird. Just because the music gets louder and a big loud noise does not make it scary.I been so disappointed with the media lately with PG-13 horror that they not worth the 1 and half to 2 hours of watching. A few that I thought for an example as terrible is Others, The Fog remake, The Skeleton Key, Signs, The Village, Sixth Sense, and a lot more are bad.If your looking for a diet version of horror movie, this is one for you. For me I do not need a diet or light version of horror movie to see. They are just no way scary at all.The people that are saying this review is not good are probably girl screaming boys or teenager girls that go to PG-13 horror movies to scream at every single loud noise in theaters to annoy anyone that is sitting around them. A normal adult would call this movie dumb. I actually took the chance to watch this and find out I was right this whole time. It sucks like all PG-13 horror claiming trash. Heck, this might be worse than Poltergeist, but I can not even watch that anymore. Not very many horror so called horror even Rated R or Unrated are even scary, but at least the gore gives something more interesting to see, than this crap. If I attempt to watch another PG-13 so called cheated horror flick I will shoot or some how kill myself first.Do not. I repeat. Do not, see this trash. I can not believe James Wan made this after Dead Silence. If he does not redeem himself with a R horror, then he went down with all the Directors that went to PG-13 too. I will never end the complaining with these trashy movies.",Insidious
176,hoytyhoyty,Had us jumping off the couch,10,9 August 2014,"I'd possibly even give 'Insidious' an 8/10, it's very, very scary. It certainly deserves higher than 6.8, but c'est la vie that's the public for you.I have only one major criticism: the producers/director need to learn about DYNAMIC RANGE in sound. Whilst I don't mind loud bumps for making you jump, these aren't so much loud bumps as soooo loud it's WHAT?? WHAT?? I CAN'T HEAR YOU?? WHAT?? - this it does after pulling the childish trick of having everyone speak quietly so that you turn up the volume, then blows your eardrums during a scary part (cinema systems can handle it by themselves). It's immature, pretentious and frankly just irritating - if your playback apparatus has a compressor/limiter function, USE IT.But of the story, the unfolding, the characters, the build-up - all the stuff that matters? Yeah, it's got them! Insidious has the lot.It builds slowly, then starts to scare the hell out of you with macabre events, leaving you unsettled. Then it really starts to pour the action on.It even provides some comic relief in a couple of places - nice to see something that doesn't take itself so seriously that it can't let its hair down - but this just seems to make the scares even worse because you let your guard down!I liked Insidious, and I like the sequel too.",Insidious

179,schroeder-gustavo,Not your average haunted house horror flick...,8,13 June 2015,"Insidious takes a very different and original approach to the typical haunted house theme we have seen countless times in movies. Let me start off by saying the atmosphere throughout the movie is amazing: the way they combined creepy music with disturbing imagery is incredible and the filmmakers did a great job in creating this. Also, great performances by basically everyone cast for this movie. I also find it quite amazing when a horror movie can disturb you with a minimum amount of blood and this movie shows that it is possible to do so. I do think the movie has its flaws, though. One of these is borrowing the basic idea for the movie from Poltergeist, in which the little girl gets pulled into this spiritual world and the parents are trying to get her out of there. Also, there are one or two really unnecessary jump scares in the movie but mostly James Wan knows how to build tension and execute these very well because most of the jump scares in the movie are rightfully earned and my issue is just with one or two. Props to the crew for creating such a creepy and original movie with a pretty small budget of about only $1.5 Million. But I think the small budget helps the movie in overall creepiness, from the lighting they used to the practical and great makeup the spirits have in the film, great job. I also loved the fact that a minimum amount of CGI was used, which helps up the creepiness. I had a lot of fun with Insidious and, aside from a few issues, it is mostly an original and creepy horror movie.",Insidious
180,jake-law123,Scariest film of all time!,7,23 July 2011,"When it comes to a horror film for me, 10:00 p.m. in the basement, lights out, headphones on, volume cranked, full screen, and I say to myself, ""lets do this"". No, not really, but yeah. By the time I finished this film, I had some wetness in my pants, and was shaking like crazy. This film is insanely scary to no end. They may be mostly jump scares, but some psychological stuff is thrown in also, and the jump scares fuel them, making them 10x more scarier.The film's dark atmosphere and beautiful and scary music score fuels it into each scene preparing you for the worst, then hits you where you least expect it. BOOM! jump scare, a psychological one here and there. But yeah, not much else but jumpers. But that's still fine. There's nothing wrong with them. Now a days, psychologically scaring someone is almost impossible, so what other choice do director's have. But this one found a way to make it work. Quite a clever maneuver.Some don't like jumpers, and that's fine. But in this film, its an exception, no question. Because the jump scares don't just scare the ever living s**t out of you, but they make the more psychological scares scarier than usual. You'll know what I mean when you see it.Most modern day horror films don't fit the bill of scariness, such as Paranormal Activity. But films such as this, and Disturbia, it works like a charm. When I first heard of this, I thought it would just be another stupid horror film thinking it was scary, and just had pointless bull crap in it. But instead I got something different. I got a horror film and a director, actually trying, and succeeding.This film was simply nonstop scary, and in terms of horror films, that means its good. The scarier the better. And for this film, it couldn't be scarier, so it couldn't be better. Scariest film ever!",Insidious

Ghost stories can end up being cheesy and cheep or they can be a frightening experience if directed with creativity and originality. The film does contain some bone chilling scene and is effective in making sure it sticks at the back of your mind when you lay down in bed.It not groundbreaking by any means but it sure trumps over films recently released in the genre. Unlike other ghost tales, this film is quick off the mark and successfully pulls you in.Also like many other ghost films, the father will always be in a state of denial, belittling the claims of their wife's or children. Agreed, the father in this does seem more approachable and in fact becomes centre of the attention. The first act effortlessly drags you in. Second act leaves you wanting more frights and the final act takes you a surreal journey which some may or may not.Overall, the film achieves its goal on delivering a chilling experience and making sure you don't forget it any time soon after viewing.",Insidious

The only good part was there is a hilarious scene about a seance with a goofy psychic and involves an unexpected accessory she puts on. It was laugh out loud funny. But besides that, nothing interesting. The effects are bad and very cheesy. You can tell this movie didn't have much of a budget. Nice house though, its amazing a teacher could afford a big house like that in a place like California. Yea, right. I'm being sarcastic here.

185,bushtony,Less than half good,4,2 May 2011,"The first half is great. If I were rating this on the first half alone it would score an 8 or 9. But then, well...Haunted house movies are overburdened with clichés these days and this one is no different. Yet, the way in which the atmosphere is generated from the outset is extremely skilled and considered. The camera angles, the build-up, the inspired use of music and sound, all combine to create a successfully creepy and nervy ambiance. The scene where the wife sees through the window a short figure in black dancing to ""Tiptoe Through The Tulips"" gives the nape of the neck a good tingling for a moment. The triggers within the script are cued immaculately, timed just right for the right unnerving effect. It kicks off and sustains an unswervingly solid creativity for the first fifty-percent of it's running time.Everything is cleverly crafted until this critical midpoint, wherein a decision must be made about the reveal, the moment for exposition when the audience begins to take delivery of what is going on and why. The makers opt for the most campy, hokey, misguided direction to take and the whole construct catastrophically falls apart.The introduction of the two Ghostbusters rejects, paranormal comedy nerds, is utterly jarring. They have lots of homemade electronic spirit-detecting paraphernalia to talk about and a standard slacker animosity for each other. Then the little old psychic lady, a physically normalised version of the eccentric short-stop from Poltergeist, steps in and dons a gas mask for a séance. She rattles off lots of mind-stupefying mumbo-jumbo about the afterlife and out of body experiences that absolutely ravages the fabric of credibility that the film has established. Next we're off to the astral plane, the realm of the dead, and it's really very badly realised - a sort of emptier, darker version of the real world with grinning, painted mannequins and lots of Alice Cooper eye makeup. The downhill plunge all the way to the ""oh, like I didn't see that coming - yawn"" shock ending is astonishingly abrupt and irreversible.What starts as a genuinely disturbing paranormal chiller suddenly and sharply devolves into a banal, low-rent version of The Cell or Dreamscape, and my interest almost completely evaporated. It's such a shame that the trajectory of the premise didn't continue and deliver the expected payload in the second half. Seldom have I seen a film go from near genius to total bilge so completely, utterly and irredeemably. It's a real shame.The lesson is, when it's time to reveal what's been going on, these filmmakers should really try a lot harder in future to make what comes next as good as, if not better than, what has gone before.

188,el7,I Wanna See It Again,9,7 April 2011,"Only next time I won't be hiding behind my bag of popcorn for most of the movie. Insidious tells a tale about a family who flees their haunted house, only to discover that it was never actually the house that was haunted. The proceedings follow a familiar path to anyone who has seen classics of this genre like The Haunting and Poltergeist, but it tells it so much better than similar films of more recent vintage. Right out of the gate it spooked me. I can't think of another movie that grabbed me by the throat quite that fast that I've seen in a theater recently. A good bit of the credit for that goes to Joseph Bishara, who wrote a score that skittered up my spine like a spider. Director James Wan also made great use of shadows and unexpected juxtapositions, and just created such an all-around sense of dread that even when you're pretty sure you know what's about to happen, it's still freaking scary when it does. Leigh Whannell hits all the marks for an Old Dark House movie, and layers it with believable middle class family pathos. The actors all fill out their roles sympathetically, and Lin Shaye in particular knocks it out of the park as the psychic who tries to help the family. The only flaw I can see here is that the way the story plays out is not really going to surprise anyone familiar with this genre. If you watch a lot of haunted house horror, I'll bet you even guess the twist. However, it's all told so very, very well that I'll only take away one point for that. Highly recommended!",Insidious

192,dharmendrasingh,Wan uses cliché like it's back in fashion,5,19 April 2011,"The age-old formula sets the tone. A quintessential American family settles into a quintessential American house. Within days the wife, Renai (Rose Byrne) starts hearing strange noises and sees what she's sure are apparitions, but what her husband, Josh (Patrick Wilson) calls her imagination.It takes the sudden unexplained comatose of one of their sons for Josh to take Renai seriously. Though he remains sceptical, he agrees to change house. All is okay in the new home until the same sorts of things occur: more freakish noises and strange sightings.Now Renai is hysterical, so Josh enlists a pair of ghost-busters. (It was correct to make them comedic and not take them seriously.) Wan uses cliché like it's back in fashion. I counted at least five: a heater turns on by itself, doors opens by themselves, the clock has a pendulum, mysterious kids run in and out of view and doctors can't diagnose the boy's condition; they've 'never before seen anything like it' (why not find out who has?).Turns out the boy has been possessed by a particularly nasty demon, which has got to him in a realm called 'The Further' (hell?). To get him back, Josh must ignore his fears and enter this godforsaken place.There's no build-up. Clichés are like contractions: they come out of nowhere and then disappear, never to return. Why are demons so coy? Wan's demons – get this – 'crave life', but like to toy with their victims before revealing themselves.

It seemed right up my alley; supernatural movies are my favorite subgenre of horror and I actively seek them out, from the mainstream right through the low-budget indies. But ultimately Insidious was a disappointment.Most people who didn't enjoy the movie cite that the third act borders on absurd. While that's partially true (there were actually points where I felt like the protagonist was being attacked by The Crow and Darth Maul, and the explanation is a bit of a stretch) that's not the reason the movie didn't work for me.The reason it didn't work for me is that everything about it was ""overcooked"". Even the opening credits, which could have been understated and dread-inducing, were diminished by CGI effects. It pulled out all the good old tropes that us ghost movie fans look for - the kids drawings, the creepy tune on the gramophone, the gentle buildup of sinister events etc. - but in each case it was just handled too heavily, too evidently, too gaudily to sustain the foreboding atmosphere that drives the best of these types of movies.The only two genuinely creepy scenes were already revealed in the trailer and everything else unfortunately served to detract from those moments by being so heavy handed. It begins by masquerading as a ghost movie for adults, but don't buy into it... by the third act you'll probably agree that this was clearly targeted at a younger, dare I say it, sure I dare - ADD - generation.I see what James Wan was trying to do with Insidious, I really do - it was a brave attempt to update Poltergeist for a new generation - but now I realize it takes someone with a finer touch than him to pull off a feat that big.",Insidious
194,wandereramor,"More like Inshi -- nah, it's not worth it",5,13 October 2012,"Insidious is not a haunted house movie. This is something that the movie tagline and all of its ads trumpet, but it still treats it as a major revelation. So for the first 45 minutes or so we're forced through the umpteenth rehash of Amityville, with the same stock characters and cheap scares one would expect from James ""Saw"" Wan. Well, that's not entirely fair -- it avoids Wan's penchant for blood and gore, but doubles down on loud noises and quick flashes of something that wouldn't look very scary in the light. I'm fine with a bit of misdirection, even an extended pretense at being a different type of movie -- hell, I loved Audition -- but when this lasts for half the film, and is as bad as this is, it has to be regarded as a failure.When we finally get to the actual cause of the spooky events things pick up a bit. It's still not exactly a good movie, but it's a fairly entertaining one, replete with long-held secrets and weird spirits. Insidious creates its own mythology, and it's expectedly unwieldy, but still more interesting than what it was before. It's still braindead, but for about half an hour it's thoroughly addictive popcorn fare.But the characters are too generic and the baddie too vague to ultimately sustain interest, and the de riguer twist ending is just tiresome. What gets me is that it's not as though the extended misdirection is even necessary for, or builds suspense to, the entertaining half-hour that is the peak of Insidious. Maybe Wan wouldn't have been able to extend that second act to feature length, but at least he could try. As it is, Insidious doesn't fulfill its ambitions and spends most of its time shooting itself in the foot. The fact that this has been described by some as the best horror of the year doesn't speak well for the genre.",Insidious

But when the central idea was revealed before the midpoint, it became a silly exercise in quick glances of demons and ghostly looking people that reminded me of Halloween Scare Houses, or Carnival Dark House Rides, and by the end, I was bored and reduced to occasional chuckles and whispered jokes to my friend watching with me.For anyone to suggest this is one of the scariest films ever, they either haven't seen many, or they scare awfully easily. To be genuinely scary, a movie must make the viewer buy into the happenings, not just see a lot of scary faces with loud noises. The idea itself should have suspense and dread. This film also had the cliché of an older lady, probably a medium, explain all the hokey happenings as though this were a well known phenomenon. I could list at least 20 scarier movies going back to the 50's and 60's than this disappointingly dumb film.

There's an evil child film almost every year, and what separates one from the rest? You have every right to think so, but not with ""Insidious"". Trust me when I say it. ""Insidious"" is an entirely different beast. One that actually resonates with scares and intrigue. One that relies on character development, and a script to hold it together.

It's all smooth sailing until Dalton is in a supposed ""coma"", but the actual reality is that he's haunted. What will Dalton's family do to stop this entity?First of all, many complain that the second act bogs down the film and is inferior to its first half. I wholeheartedly disagree. I think as a whole the film is just fine. Yes, there's a drastic tonal shift mid-way, but that doesn't detract from the experience. The first half plays a typical haunted house flick, except it's actually scary, and the suspense is well built. Then the second half is like a cross between ""Poltergeist"", ""House of Wax"", and a little of ""Beetlejuice"" sprinkled in for good measure. Furthermore, the performances while nothing to write home about, are pretty decent to say the least. The two leading protagonists do their job and Dalton is pretty solid given what he had to work with. Moreover, the script is very inventive, and has multiple twists and turns. Yes, this isn't the most unique screenplay, but it still stands on its own, and is actually quite effective.To top it off, the production is just very beautiful. This movie is very easy on the eyes when it comes to cinematography and location. Now the question everyone is dying to hear. Is it scary? I'd say yes, but don't get too carried away. If you walk in thinking your going to have nightmares, or if you're going to see Rosie O' Donnell, chances are you'll be a little disappointed. However, if you're going in expecting a creepy thriller that just happens to have a few intense moments, you'll be in for a fun night out. Also, I love the nostalgic factor this movie has. It feels as though it was made in the 80's. Old school horror strikes back!With a restraint heavy PG-13 rating, and a middle-of-the-road concept, ""Insidious"" isn't looking too pretty. However, looks can be deceiving. This is one movie that doesn't mess around, and doesn't play it safe either. I can easily say I will be revisiting this film from time to time just because it's so fun. You'll laugh, you'll jump, you'll be entertained. This is what a fun night out should be like.

I have watched it twice now, and I can't tire of it. It is an intriguing story, and well acted by all. I couldn't help but compare it though, to an updated version of the Steven Spielberg film, 'Poltergiest' Really really enjoyed this one. Well worth the money, and a watch in a darkened room! From James Wan, the director of the original and best Saw movie, this is an excellent very creepy movie about a young couple who think their new home is haunted. But they realize as they move house and the ghost follows them to their next home that it's not the house that's haunted. A very well acted film, Patrick Wilson from Watchmen and X Men First Class and Damages star Rose Byrne are both very good as the young couple, this has elements of both Poltergeist and Paranormal Activity though without the camera. This film proves that you don't need to have lots of blood guts and gore to make a good horror film though if you're one of those people that love lots of blood guts and gore then you will probably hate this movie as there is hardly any.

200,amosduncan_2000,Passable time waster,4,5 April 2011,"I was about to give up on ""Insidious,"" then there was a rather creative sequence about halfway through that carried me to the end of the movie, weak as it was.I guess it's quaint to suggest a horror film should have any kind of modestly believable back story that gives some credibility to the events; nowadays you just turn up the volume and have the cast start screaming. It may be past the stage, however, where we should CREDIT the movie makers for not thinking up any real story. This is a family values scare flick, so we don't get any nudity or threatening sexuality. The male lead had a part in the classy studio flick ""Little Children"" a few years back but I guess he's still waiting on another one. Barbara Hershey is the ""Baby Jane"" veteran star slumming in the nonsense. You get a typical shocker ending, that's shocking because it totally contradicts what the movie maker just told you happened. Funny, such things aren't very shocking anymore!Comic relief guys are not funny but the spook hunter lady was likably non-actorish, like a substitute teacher who somehow wondered onto the set. There is a certain silly, spook house quality to the movie that is kind of likable. The use of the late Tiny Tim's novelty hit ""Tiptoe through the Tulips"" is kind of funny. Tiny Tim was scarier, though, then anything in this movie.",Insidious

202,BeanieCore,Spooky enough.,7,12 October 2021,"""Insidious"" has become something of a horror classic within it's decade. It is easily the most frequently imitated horror film of the last 20 or so years, with even many of director James Wan's following efforts being an attempt to re-capture the lightning in a bottle energy he found here. And though the supernatural shenanigans have all become unspeakably cliched by now, ""Insidious"" arrived at a time in which ghost stories and atmospheric horror were not the norm. Subtly re-shifting the entire horror landscape for years to come, back in what could be considered, a more ""classical"" direction. And though it doesn't quite live up to the insane hype built around it, it is a solid, effective and enjoyable horror flick. Much better than most of it's peers could ever hope to be.Both one of the film's greatest assets, and eventual downfalls, is it's reverance for classic horror. Seasoned genre fanatics will be able to easily spot moments that pay not so subtle homage to various films such as ""The Shining"" and ""A Nightmare On Elm Street"". Hell, the entire plot could be considered a re-writing of ""Poltergeist"". But Wan and trusted screen-writer Leigh Whannell inject just enough of their own personality into the proceedings to keep them from being stale, or feeling unoriginal. The film's strongest point is it's incredibly thick atmosphere. Wan takes time to let the scares and chilly ambiance build to a crescendo. There are several effective jump-scares, but they're not oversaturated as in many modern horror films. And the best moments of fright rely much more on nightmarish imagery, tension and writing.Another asset is the cast. Rose Byrne and Patrick Wilson are instantly likeable and believable as the parents. Meanwhile Whannell and Angus Sampson play a couple of quirky and loveable paranormal investigators. But most memorable is Lin Shaye, as psychic ""Elise Rainier"". Shaye has long been an underrated character actor, and she simply inhabits the role of Elise. Though Wan's direction is tight, the same can't be said for the cinematography. David R. Leonetti shoots the film in dull, washed-out colors, and his sloppy camera-work gives the film a clunky feel. The effects can be hit or miss as well, but most of the ghouls are well-designed enough to become iconic. All together, this isn't the most original or well produced horror flick of the 2010's, and it's certainly not the flawless, monumental classic that some make it out to be. But it's a good, fun effort. Shame about that wave of unbearable copycats though.",Insidious
203,boris_unanimate,"Better Than I Expected, But Not As Scary As Many Claim It to Be",6,28 October 2020,"I'm usually not a fan of movies that are full of fake scares, annoyingly predictable musical cues and loud noises, but I was pleasantly surprised by 'Insidious'. And although I don't understand how some think it's the ""scariest movie ever"" or even terribly frightening, I was engaged throughout most of it and never bored. Maybe I'm not scared by loud noises that anticipate scares like I am by atmosphere, but to each their own.I like Whannell's writing and acting, and the ending was well executed and gripping compared to most modern mainstream horror movies. James Wan did a great job directing and making the most out of the small budget, showing how to use practical effects & makeup to create an atmosphere of anxiety towards the end. I wasn't scared so much but the movie was good at what it promises. Way better than 'The Conjuring' & 'Annabelle' movies.",Insidious

The ghostly figures are about as scary as the painted zombies in Michael Jacksons thriller video (yeah, that ""scary"") and the main ""scary"" creature who is the spitting image of Darth Maul is so unscary I really was in fits of laughter! I wish someone could tell me which bits were so frightening. The whole thing looks like some cheap made for TV movie, and is such a let down from James Wan. I haven't read up on how much it cost to make but it really seems as if all expenses were spared. This thing wouldn't scare a child.

What makes this movie scary is that as a viewer you imagine what terror the family must be facing.Movies about spirits are not new. Yet Insidious makes it feel fresh with unique theories of the paranormal and the spirits whos malevolence are obvious due to their appearance. What adds to the unsettling feel is that there's something humanlike and subtle about their appearance that makes you imagine what horrific fate they must have had. Also the settings were very atmospheric.The strength of this movie is that it pulls you into the story. It makes you believe the story could be possible because a lot of attention was given to adding depth to the characters when needed but also leaving room for mystery when it was needed.

210,jacklmauro,Close to Excellent....,8,24 September 2013,"It's too bad when Wan goes along beautifully and then loses his grip. That's the only real problem here, and kindly ignore reviews trashing the acting, etc. It's uniformly solid, with believable leads, and Wilson nicely avoids what could be a 'pretty boy' trap. The scares begin and build creatively, and the direction keeps you in pace with the victims. Yes, the whole idea is 'Poltergeist', but absolutely everything's been done before anyway, and what matters is the novelty of approach. This film brings it. Sadly, the rescue of the boy in the Further is just too, too protracted, and relies too much on stock horror nightmare props. I'd have preferred plain murky, for why would these lost souls be so fetishistic over scary dolls and creepy music? This is a dimension, after all, and not a realm within a person's mind, which might explain those elements. And...I wanted a happy ending. Sorry. But I did. All that said, however, it's highly watchable and light years better than all the slasher/sadism porn calling itself horror.",Insidious
211,scott-sw,One of the best,8,2 April 2011,"Insidious is the latest horror endeavor by the original Saw creator, James Wan, and Paranormal Activity producer Jason Blum that will literally terrify audiences. It revolves around Josh Lambert (Patrick Wilson) and Renai Lambert (Rose Byrne as they move into a new home. Their oldest son, Dalton (Ty Simpson) is an adventurer who likes to explore. One night when venturing into the attic, he falls and hits his head. The next morning, he is in a coma. Unable to do anything, Josh and Renai bring him home to care for in the hope he will one day come out of it. Then, strange things start to happen. Strange noises occur. Faces appear. Things are moved. The alarm sounds. Strange happenings occur more frequently. After a while, they have had enough and move to a small house for lease. It does not help. Apparently, it was not the house that was haunted, but rather Dalton. More bizarre things happen - frightening things. At this point, they turn for help from Josh's Mom, (Barbara Hershey) and Elise (Lin Shaye). She explains the strange things that pervade: what is happening, why it is happening, and how to get Dalton back. This leads to a secret memory that Josh has buried (which was easy to figure out) and a terrifying venture into the spiritual world. Insidious, despite a few flaws is deft craft, using atmosphere, suspense, terror, and stunning visual imagery that will frighten the deepest part of your soul. This accomplishment is primarily done with Wan's wonderful direction that leaves an audience confused, guessing, and frightened. The performances by Wilson, Byrne, Shay, and Simpson are also good, giving the audience people to care about. The story is also engaging, slowly unfolding in a subtle way that keeps our interest. It is part Amityville Horror, part Poltergeist, part Exorcist, and a few other horror gems. The most stunning aspect is the imagery, especially when crossing over into the spirit world. It is not only frightening, but downright disturbing. Yes, it has a few flaws. The explanation offered by Elise seems too convenient and easy, as if writers assumed the audience HAD to know what was going on instead of leaving us in the dark to figure it out for ourselves. The ""surprise"" for the audience is also weak, and is something that can be seen a mile away. Making up for these flaws is a disturbing terrifying movie that relies on suspense and fear instead of buckets of blood and guts. In the end I was exhausted by fear, and it took almost an hour after movie's end for the terror to fade. This is one of the few times a horror movie has infused a fear into my soul. I would rank this as one of THE most terrifying movies I have ever seen.",Insidious

213,austin-takahashi,Insidious - 2.5 Stars,5,1 March 2013,"""Insidious"" is a horror movie about an average family haunted with supernatural forces that possess a natural tendency to open lots of doors and make funny noises. Most fans of this subgenre will praise it not because it is an excellent film, but because the ones that came before it are infinitely much worse. Have you seen ""The Haunting in Connecticut""?The unlucky family in this horror film is the five members of the Lambert family. Each of them is terrorized by a mysterious creature, but most unlucky is young Dalton, who is in a deep sleep and would not wake up. A doctor says that he isn't in a coma. A psychic claims that his spiritual body is trapped in another dimension she likes to call, The Further. Dalton's parents, Josh and Renai, are, to say the least, confused. Whether any of these explanations makes sense or not is not a major concern, because the story mainly serves as an opening to provide scares.""Insidious"" is conscious of the genre's obvious clichés, but it avoids some of them by conforming to an unhelpful, alternative idea that is soon to be a cliché itself. Characters living in haunted houses are often so traumatized by the ghouls that they forget about the possible action of, you know, leaving the house. The Lambert family makes the practical decision of abandoning their home early on in the film, only to have their efforts thwarted when they are told that it's not the house that's haunted, but their son. ""Oooooooo"". So, instead of one haunted house, we get two haunted houses.Read more here: http://localmoviereview.com/insidious-movie-review/",Insidious
214,eonbluedan-1,Should have been so much better!,4,8 May 2011,"I thoroughly enjoyed ""Saw""; it was suspenseful and fun; James Wan was almost Hitchcockian in his approach. To an extent I enjoyed its sequel, and this would be thanks to Leigh Wannell, who starred in them, but doesn't ever seem to receive much recognition for the writing. It should have ended there, but what are you going to do, the market is what it is, right? Given that ""Insidious"" sees the two guys back together, and after the rather lacklustre ""Paranormal Activity 2"" and the torture porn of late, I was looking forward to a film that would provide a rare opportunity to enjoy some intelligent and genuinely frightening psychological terror. To an extent, they succeed.First the good. Credit must go to the film for some great casting; I'm a big fan of Patrick Wilson (see ""Hard Candy"" and even ""The A-Team"" for evidence of his ability) and Rose Byrne, who are great as this perfect couple, and very busy character actress Lin Shaye (""A Nightmare On Elm Street"", ""My Sister's Keeper"" and ""Snakes On A Plane"" to name a few of many!) has great screen presence. The problem is they are under the direction of somebody whose intention with the film falters halfway through, meaning they find themselves either doing things that do not make sense, seem silly and absurd, or worst of all, they are wasted by being given very little to do; this is a particularly bad crime when you have someone in your film with as much to give as Barbara Hershey (""Black Swan"").Wan and Whannell spend pretty much the first half of the movie providing a haunted house setup; the initial haunting, the house move (not really a spoiler, given that the trailer TOLD us what the twist of the story is), and the events that take you to the pivotal point of the film are all done very slowly; some would argue a bit too slowly, but it's good to see him taking his time with the creepy setup. Not since ""The Exorcist"" has there been a horror movie I can think of that has been paced in this way; it causes a restlessness in the audience, and a desire to want the story to push forward, which of course heightens your anticipation and makes you more uncomfortable. Wan is very good at the classic vibe; he actually manages to do what ""Paranormal Activity"" did, but better. He tips his hat to many other classic of the genre, a bit too heavily at points, but it remains very solid and creepy.This only emphasises the disappointment we feel when the film reaches the part of explaining what has happened, and sets up what will occur in the second half. Whether it was Whannell's choice to change gear, or instruction from on high to get away from the ""Paranormal Activity"" similarities (same producing team), we can't know, but whoever's it was, they should regret it. The explanation of things feels like a bad re-working of ""Poltergeist"", and the previously scary techniques are replaced with ham-fisted effects and dodgy makeup. Too much is shown, and due to the look of certain aspects of the piece, it starts to become a bit laughable; the on screen events becomes sillier and sillier, and we reach a point where the tone becomes one of ""creepy computer game"", rather than ""scary horror film"". There is an introduction of comedy into the film that is completely uncalled for and though genuinely funny, the jokes could not be more out of place; they ruin all the atmosphere that has been created, and you know it is going downhill. This is also the point where we have stopped being scared, and this is a problem for any horror film, hurtling towards its final act with the audience having been lost some time ago.Speaking of the final act, it is just absurd, and in thinking about the film afterwards, you begin to realise just how many loose ends there are, how many plot holes are left open, and then the question of whether it is all for the sake of a sequel comes to mind. Given that ""Paranormal Activity"" had one, it is hard to imagine them not pushing for one here, which is a shame, because this should have been the brilliant, one-off psychological terroriser the first half promised so heartily, and not the silly theme park walk-through it becomes.All this said, James Wan has some talent, as he has proved, and I will not give up on him just yet. Worth seeing on the big screen, in a room full of people for some of the jump-scares, but otherwise, ""Insidious"" is one to rent.",Insidious
215,cmovies-99674,Created the different dimension horror,8,25 October 2017,"On the surface the different dimension horror genre is so far fetched, but when you look deeper at INSIDIOUS you see a trend of similarities after the film aired. Movies like THE CONJURING and SINISTER were created because of this movie, and although this is the most modern of classic horrors it is probably the most influential. This film takes large motifs like children, photographs, and spirit hunters and uses them together in the plot to create a very intense film. Those motifs are now famous and this is why this movie created the different dimension horror genre.www.chorror.com",Insidious
216,sixhoos,It's OK...,6,28 May 2019,"It's a ""Poltergeist"" ripoff, but not a bad one. I found the ending to be a bit lame, obviously just a setup for the reportedly lame sequels which I don't plan to watch.",Insidious
217,Tender-Flesh,No it's insipid,6,15 November 2011,"I suggest that, if you choose to watch Insidious, that you also check out the Horror 101 that is a special feature on the DVD. It is about 10 minutes long containing interview footage of the film's creators discussing the film's background. You will see they are woefully in need of their own Horror 101 to sit through.OK, basic plot outline, a married couple with 3 kids, two boys about 9 years old and a baby girl, move into a ""creepy"" new old house. There are plenty of floor creaks and the other usual trappings to make you think the house is haunted. One boy has an accident in the house, goes into an unexplainable coma, and while in the coma, weird things happen in that house as well as the new house the wife forces the husband to move them to. So, we at last are told it is not a haunted house or even two haunted houses, but rather a case of ""astral projection"" gone wrong. If you are not familiar with the concept, projection involves a sleeper whose soul can leave the body, at will and normally controlled by the mind, and wanders through the astral plane or wherever. The boy wanders too far and too long and eventually becomes lost, thereby leaving his physical form as an inviting new home for other lost souls or even demons. A seance is held and so on.Oddly enough, as I was killing this movie mentally by noting all the other films this movie borrowed from, I found myself unnerved by the non-supernatural aspects of the movie. Hearing a voice in the baby monitor, real or imagined, would be scary, but it's not a new idea. And having the home alarm go off and front door open, plus the knocking at the door, would be something that'd scare me, but it doesn't have to have a supernatural force behind it. IMDb lists about a dozen films that already deal with astral projection, so for the film makers to say they didn't think this topic had been covered before is, well, pretty typical for today's moronic young horror director.The film House from the 80's stood out in my mind the most as I watched this. If you haven't seen that, a father loses his son in an old house and goes between worlds, meeting ghosts and demons, in order to find and free him to bring him home, where they are followed into the physical world by someone(something) who knew the father earlier in life. Sound familiar? Yes, it does. Do yourself a solid and watch House instead. House had an intense impact on me as a kid, influencing much of my artwork at the time. It's not necessarily scary but far more enjoyable than Insidious. Even the repeated moving camera outside the house at night was right out of House.This is exactly the sort of film I'd expect from the creators for Saw and Paranormal Activity. Except for an F-Bomb, this could have been a TV-movie or a decent addition to Goosebumps. I felt like I was watching a professionally made real film version of Paranormal Activity, another film I could do without.The film stock looked cheap, almost made-for-cable and reminiscent of those Haunting shows, as if I wasn't watching a film, but a re-creation by ""actors"" who couldn't get a job doing anything real, repeating the lines of a story that supposedly happened to someone else.And, just like with Paranormal Activity, I didn't care about the family because they didn't act like real people. I'm sorry, but you don't get your butt whipped by some devils in a seance then just go downstairs and chat about it. I normally don't boycott horror film directors or writers, but in this case, they have forced my hand. I will never watch anything by this ""director"" again.",Insidious

220,JohnnyPHreak,"Decently directed but over hyped ""scary"" movie",4,15 September 2014,"Insidious is one of those movies I avoided. I don't jump on fads. I am very hipster when things don't fit into my nerd realm. That goes hardcore for movies. Insidious was one of those scary movies that came out and blew up. I hated this trend of the next scary movie banking at the box office when my idea of real horror was passed over. It seemed like every year there was a new scary movie or a sequel to a new scary movie. They were all a year or two years apart. Have to bank on that hype right?Right from the start I was going in with a negative sense of view. But I thought that if I was watching it then there was something about it that appealed to me. The film stars Patrick Wilson and Rose Bryne as loving parents who start experiencing odd occurrences in their new home. When the events escalate they move to a new house and realize there is something more involved. It's a haunted house story with a 'twist'. From the start of the film you can tell even with the budget James Wan as a director is talented.It is the exact duo that brought us the Saw franchise. James Wan is behind the lens with Leigh Whannell writing and acting. Technically the film looks great. There are some inventive shots and the ending haunt is staged very well. But the story feel like it's been done before. There are all sorts of elements from multiple haunted house films. If a film could be called a mash up I would give this film that title. Wilson and Bryne do their best with that they have. The story fails them. When things start to ramp up everything of the why is explained by a newly emerged character.There is a back story to why this is all happen. This is not explained until nearly the end of the film. It's newly introduced characters that wrap up everything in a nice tight package. Some of the back story is shown but not much. It would have been nice if these piece of the story were scattered throughout the entire film. I wasn't really scared as the 'boo' scares weren't stage that well. It was more of putting things for the audience to jump instead of building tension. The most entertaining and well executed sequence was the ending.There was a nice twist at the end that on it's own would have sat very well. But knowing that there is a sequel comes off as strategically place for a sequel to be made. There is just too much hype surround this film and for me it didn't (never had the chance) to live up to it. Seeing Sinister and The Conjuring (from James Wan) I know there are good haunted house films out there that live up to the hype. I can only describe this film with a quote taken from a user on Reddit, ""I think the reason so many people like it and praise it is because it is so bland; it feels safe. It's the movie the average moviegoer can go to, not get too scared, but still say that they love a horror movie."" Well said.4.4 out of 10",Insidious
221,movieman89-2,James Wann and Oren Peli make a great team,8,12 May 2011,"I first of all saw the trailer of this at the movies when seeing another movie. The trailer definitely caught my attention. But then I saw it was by the makers of the first Saw and Paranormal Activity (which I'm a huge fan of both of those films) and thought this I definitely got to see.I went to see it and came out extremely impressed.The story was original and captivating. It has mix of Poltergeist and Paranormal Activity. I was nearly disappointed when the story mentioned about possession because it has been used so many times. But when I found it's more than that with the boy's ability, it immediately grabbed me.Very interesting use of lighting effects which made the scenes even more tense.The acting was great and very convincing and made it easier to connect well with the characters.The soundtrack really gave me the creeps. It even freaked me out on the opening titles. Even during when the scare scenes built up more and more, I even tried to find a way to break the silence by moving in my chair or even making a slight cough.Through out this film, you really had to look all over the settings when the scare scenes because you just notice things nearly at the last minute, like it did with Paranormal.The special effects were great. There wasn't much but it use appropriately when it was needed For horror fans like me, this is definitely for you. Trust me, you won't be wasting you're money.",Insidious

223,Dandy_Desmond,Above average,7,6 May 2011,"I went to see Insidious on the back of the released stills of the movie which showed promise - I have usually been let down, this time I wasn't. I really enjoyed it. It also succeeded in making the audience cower in their seats, making girlfriends cling onto boyfriends arms, nervous laughter after the scares and most importantly having the ability to stay with you long after it has finished. Insidious plot is standard with a little twist. Man and wife with young family move into haunted house (you think) slamming doors, voices, strange faces its all here. Toss in the psychic woman, the gadgets to capture changes in temperature and you have the usual set pieces. Influences are very obvious but never directly copied as Insidious definitely makes its own stamp in the haunted house movie genre. What can also normally disappoint me in some of these ghost films is the ghosts are never shown enough, here they are and although some of the ghosts miss the mark, there are some genuinely frightening moments. It also manages to keep interest as it switches from a creepy movie to almost a monster movie for me it did lose its tense edge when this happened but at least it never got boring. For gore hounds and torture porn horror fans this is not for you - it is more poltergeist, the fog and the Shining than Saw or Hostel. As a big horror fan myself I would recommend it as a fun scary ride.",Insidious
224,toddg-473-289818,Decent but not flawless,7,17 June 2014,"Even though this movie came out in 2010, the first collaboration I saw between director James Wan and actor Patrick Wilson was 2013's THE CONJURING. They worked together on INSIDIOUS, and this movie carries some similarities in story. As an audience member, I appreciate how James Wan captures and maintains the flavor of normal people being attacked by evil intending, supernatural forces. Seeing Leigh Whannell's name in the opening credits is always a bonus for me, as I have appreciated all of his work in the horror genre since he first put SAW on the map back in 2004.In INSIDIOUS, we are introduced to Josh and Renai Lambert and their three children, adjusting to their move into a new house. Their oldest son Dalton inexplicably falls into a coma which doctors cannot accurately diagnose, and then we are slowly given the explanation as to what has really happened to Dalton. The story further unfolds as we are told, and then see firsthand, what it will take to bring Dalton back.I got a good scare out of this movie, but found the plot development to be a little slow in the beginning. Also, the character of Elise, the older woman who serves as a conduit between the living and the spirits that travel the netherworld, came on suddenly as too intense and one dimensional.

They have these people come in and try to figure out what's wrong and most people are afraid of the demons coming out of him and I didn't understand this until the lady came up and explained why the kid was sleeping for a long period of time. The family try their best to get the child out of his own world and get him back on Earth so that he could wake up, so they had the dad sleep to get him back.When I went into the theater to watch a movie about astro-projection, me and my friend were scared to death. It was scarier than Poltergiest. I mean, what? Like a sleeping film of Poltergiest? Well, yeah, I also thought it had a reference to Inception too, you know, the new movie. Yeah, both of these create new worlds.Personally, at the beginning, I found it to be kind of cliché, but then I got over it and enjoyed it a lot. The acting was superb, the script had enough details to even scare adults and the storyline was just.But, I'd be darned, I wouldn't recommend this film for anyone under 14. It would be too scary and kids would have nightmares. I hope I don't. There are very little comedy and mostly serious moments of the family trying to wake the kid up.Insidious: 7/10",Insidious
227,dutchchocolatecake,"too much, too soon",4,13 January 2013,"There's too much material and too little time for adequate cinematic presentation. Everything feels rushed and crammed into one movie. They waste too much time on irrelevant scenes, and not enough time on scenes that should be anticipated. There's too many plot twists that strain credibility, and after an hour the entire situations starts looking ridiculous. Que the nostalgic seventies technology and it gets very close to comedic.Starting with zero stars, I gave one star for originality, one star for competent acting (not Oscar winning but watchable), one star for paying homage to movies that were actually worth a damn, and another star for setting and ambiance.So I hear they are making another installment: Insidious, Chapter Two. But I can't imagine the next movie to do anything but rehash the first one. All the ideas were used in this one.And after the Paranormal Activity series; I get that people don't want to wait five years to figure out what's going on. I just don't think cramming a couple movies into one is a very good idea either.",Insidious
228,culmo80,Breath of Fresh Air for the Hollywood Horror Industry,7,20 September 2013,"This is a fun horror film to watch, mostly because its not the same crap that gets pawned off as horror these days. When we've had more than a half-dozen Saw movies (and I am aware that the same people made this movie), and other such flops, its nice to have a horror movie that doesn't rely on blood and gore.Even though it was very clear to the audience that the house itself wasn't haunted, I liked that fresh approach. The entities were all creepy, but they also weren't required to have all that much on screen time to do their work. The visit to the Further region was cool; weird but also spooky.The acting was sub-par at some points, but it wasn't too bad. The special effects were pretty good.My only complaint is that the movie was sometimes too dark that it was hard to see what was going on. This could have been the provider (Fear.net)hadn't optimized the film for presentation, but there were points where I figured it was supposed to be scary, but I had no clue what was going on.Anyway, I enjoyed this film. Hopefully it and others like it (such as the Conjuring) are a sign of things to come from the movie industry for the horror genre. There are predictions that the era of the blockbuster is coming to an end. Maybe that will mean Hollywood will focus on making good movies instead of expensive movies.",Insidious
229,blackmambamark,I will have trouble sleeping tonight....,8,3 April 2011,"Of all the genre's that Hollywood has to offer, the most tattered of the bunch is without a doubt the horror department. I am so sick of these wannabe 'so called' horror flicks that belong on late night lifetime channel. Im sick of the same old parlor tricks and scare tactics that have been used for the past 10 years. And i am even more sickened by the fact that they keep making the same crap year after year. You would figure after great horror flicks like ""The Decent"" and ""Paranormal Activity"", studios would start realizing what actually works and what audiences want to see. Hopefully in the coming years, this genre' will come back to life.When it comes to horror movies, i think the two most crucial elements are the cinematography, and the musical score. Actually, i prefer there to be no music at all. Almost all the great horror movies never use it, because they rely on scaring the audience with disturbing images, not raised music that makes everyone jump. If i want that, I'll go to a haunted house. When i go to see a horror flick, i want it to leave a lasting impression. However, movies like this are the one exception.This film had such amazing cinematography, that i didn't even care about those 'raised music' sequences. I rarely get creeped out at the theater, and this movie scared the crap out of me. I'm talking' sweaty palms, eyes wide open, my body sunk all the way down in my chair scared. And for those of you who have read my reviews in the past, i hardly ever say that about a horror flick. And what really sold it was the cinematography. This film is packed with tons of really creepy and disturbing images. So much in fact, that you will hate walking into your dark house alone. Yes, they do use the same scare tactics, but since everything in the movie looked so damn creepy and demented, i for once didn't want the lead female to hurry up and open the basement door and get it over with.The storyline is pretty decent. It's not an amazing concept or genuinely creepy on it's own. But it does a decent enough of a job to keep your interest and sell what your seeing unfold on screen. And it's safe to say that this is a very different take on your typical haunted house.Bottom Line......holy crap, i just realized that this movie is only PG-13. Is it possible for a movie to be scary as hell and only be rated PG-13? The answer is yes, and this is a prime example of that. You know when a horror movie has done it's job? It's when it scares you both in the theater, and hours later when you try to sleep at night. Tonight, i will have lots of trouble sleeping. I can easily say that this will probably be the best horror movie of the year.",Insidious
230,RileyOnFilm,"Understated, modest budget, horror at its best",10,22 November 2016,"A movie critic cohort on my blogroll, Darren at Movies 101, pointed out to me yesterday that ""Insidious"" had a ridiculously low budget of just 1.5 million. We were discussing it in context with a film he was reviewing with a small budget as well. It is true that money can buy an awesome production but there is still a lot to do with a little money. Insidious definitely fits in that category.There is no set criteria for a great horror flick, in my opinion. I rate them based on what they try to be and let me say this, it's fairly easy to detect what a horror movie is trying to be. There are ""Saw"" formulas and others for movies like ""Paranormal Activity."" I'd say there are probably a handful of classic themes/formulas and two handfuls of ones that have emerged in the past 20-30 years. Insidious follows the formula of cheap camera scares and ingenious sound effects and they are used well. Everything else in the film, including ghosts, is minimal. The creepiest scene in my opinion could have been aired on the Twilight zone in the 1960's.There may be minor spoilers the rest of the review. That doesn't mean it's not graphic. It's far less so than ""Saw,"" which was made by the same people, but it's not for very small kids like 0-7. Still, it is a minimal movie that relies on the creepiness of strobe like scares and a ghost story that really never goes anywhere  until the end. I loved the end. There is a twist that made me smile for sure. If you're looking for a great horror movie without the gore and not as much stuff jumping out as ""Paranormal Activity,"" this is a fun one to get your blood going. I didn't like some of the writing choices. For example: I thought the boy came into the house with a feeding tube far too quickly after being in the hospital. I also thought the story was way too slow and not much was developed until a certain point. It could have ""gotten to it"" much earlier for my taste. For that reason I took off just one star and still rated it very high as a great horror film.",Insidious

232,Marc_Action,Surprisingly Really Good,8,29 May 2012,"This film was much better than I expected. These days it's really hard to make something original and actually scary. Too many horror movies(or movies in general) copy heavily from previous movies and rely too much on special effects to carry the movie. Insidious is the exact opposite.Insidious relies on a really good storyline, old school scare tactics, and a great set of cast members to carry the movie. Basically, the story revolves around a young couple and their 3 children that move into a new house only to start seeing strange, paranormal things going on. One of their sons, Dalton (Ty Simpkins) falls into a deep comma for no apparent reason and doctors can't explain why. Dalton is eventually moved back home still in the comma but paranormal incidents still continue to occur, but at an increasing, dangerous pace. Dalton's mother Renai (Rose Byrne) senses the evil presence in the house more than anyone else. She then convinces her husband, Josh (Patrick Wilson) to move out.But the strange paranormal activity only follows the family to their new home. The couple then enlists the help of Elise Rainier (Lin Shaye), a modern day ghost-buster of sorts, to help them rid the house of the paranormal activity. Along the way though we witness a couple of plot twists that are for the most part nicely done and effective.Let me just say, Lin Shaye is not a well-known actress but she shines as Elise Rainier and helps set the pace for the climax of the film.In today's terms, the movie had a really, really meager budget - a paltry $1.5 million. So, it's no wonder there's a big lack of special effects that most modern horror films rely on. But don't be too disappointed. This is one scary movie (think Poltergeist). Director James Won does a terrific job of creating fear with some really creepy moments throughout the movie. A malevolent voice shouting from your baby's monitoring system, only to see no one there when you get to the room; a shadowy dark figure with claw-like hands standing in the corner of your son's dark quiet room; or how about an evil entity cursing your very existence while your assistance scribbles down his every word in a wild, possessed-like manner. Scary stuff.The only draw back to the film is once the action speeds up and the plot twists start coming into play, it sometimes comes off as ""far-fetched"" and some elements toward the end are unnecessary. However, overall the movie is great and the ending is to die for, literally.Check this movie out, it's a must see!",Insidious

234,jafar-iqbal,"Great first half, absurd second half",6,13 September 2013,"A family is seemingly haunted by spirits from another dimension, which leads to their young son going into a coma. The longer the boy remains comatose, the worse the haunting gets. A medium is brought to solve the issue, who discovers that the boy's spirit is trapped in another dimension known as The Further.I haven't watched very many horror movies at the cinema; mainly because there aren't many top quality horrors out there now. But the pull of a double-bill, and the fact that this is made by the creator of the Saw franchise, dragged me here for this. And for about half of 'Insidious', I was pleased I made the decision to go.The first half of the movie is terrific. The characters and the haunted house is all set-up nicely. You have accomplished actors in Rose Byrne (as Renai) and Patrick Wilson (as Josh) at the helm, and pretty good child actors. Like all good horror movies, the chill factor is amped up. Creaking staircases, dark doorways, scary apparitions – it's all here, and it's all very good. I'll be honest, I was a little scared. There's something quite unnerving about watching a horror movie in a dark cinema, it certainly adds to the ambiance.The second half, though, is ridiculous. As we start to understand what is going on, and what these apparitions are, the film starts to descend into absurdity. The 'monsters' aren't really that terrifying once we see them properly, and the story becomes far too mental for my liking. The best bit about the second half is the introduction of medium Elise (Lin Shaye), who is a breath of fresh air. Similarly, the characters Specs (Leigh Whannell, also the writer) and Tucker (Angus Sampson) bring some much-needed comedy to the proceedings. These three characters keep the film watchable, but doesn't stop it getting ridiculous.'Insidious' is definitely a game of two halves – the setup is nice, the payoff not so much. However, there aren't that many great American horror movies out there. So if we're using its peers as a comparison, then the film is definitely one of the stronger offerings out there. If you're able to tolerate the absurdity of the second half, then I think you'd enjoy the terror of the first.",Insidious

There are jump scares in abundance, but they all mostly work and really do take you off guard.

The story is great and the acting was great, no super-cheesy, one-liners or off-the-wall moments; it's just a plain and simple deliverance that achieves build-up scares, emotion, and just an overall spectacle not seen since Steven Spielberg's Poltergeist. Insidious Is a classic not just among horror films, but among the family drama. It shows that parents would do anything to keep their children safe, no matter the cost. Insidious is a theater-worthy film and a must-see. Don't think twice about seeing this movie, even if it's from the makers of Saw and Paranormal Activity, because it is WAY better than both, or if it's PG-13 because it shows the bloody, gory horror films how to make an effective horror without ripping off body parts or dismembering victims.

241,zactac,We have just witnessed that horror isn't dead.,9,10 October 2011,"Now I think everyone can agree that the last decade of horror movies has just been one remake and gross-out after another. Nothing has lived up to the expectations of the originals as well as nothing original has come out. It's usually something we've always seen before, however it really isn't the fault of the use of dilapidated old houses or mansions every now and then. It's more from the clichés and no feelings for any characters because the filmmakers have been mostly trying to gross us out instead of trying to make time to create people we care about as well as to do what horror movies should do, and that is to scare us. Yet it was in 2007 when Paranormal Activity came out I caught a glimpse of the future of horror. It replaces Saw as the Halloween movie to see and now we are at last getting something good from these places called ""film studios."" Drag Me to Hell definitely kept things going in the right direction in 2009 and now we have Insidious. Horror movies are finally (as well as unbelievably) getting better. And Insidious is just another reason why we shouldn't give up horror movies.The story is pretty straight-forward. A family moves into this old house then strange things start happening as well as their son falling into coma. Of course you would think the haunting has something to do with it but you never know with these movies sometimes. At first it looks like the same old kind of horror story you find from the Masters of Horror series but it progresses from that into a full blown horror movie that made me jump, squirm, and even almost scream. Even though I didn't scream I still said ""Oh my God!"" maybe a hundred times. This definitely went beyond my expectations.But it's hard to find the perfect movie for its genre and there are a few minor problems. One being that the strength of the film kinda lightens up in the last act but still maintains some of the eeriness of the rest of it. My last complaint is that when the last act starts coming to an end you can pretty much guess how it's going to end. Now with any other movie these would be the problems that could possibly destroy it. And actually those rules don't apply to Insidious. The film is held up by its eerie atmosphere that grabs you from the very beginning and the talented actors to relate to you by being normal people.The film is actually a collaboration from the creator of Paranormal Activity and the creators of Saw, you would think that such a collaboration would be disastrous but it actually was probably one of the smartest collaborations since Wes Craven worked with Kevin Williamson on the Scream movies (first two and the fourth). There is no gore (which surprised me considering the Saw creators were in on it) or even any blood at all. The movie does what scary movies should do and that is to scare and not gross-out. So while there are some problems, Insidious is probably one of the scariest movies of the year and helps create something original out of the so frequently used ghost stories with haunted, old houses. And that's what is so good about Insidious. It shows that most of the time it's not the setting or the story that makes horror movies bad, it can be the filmmakers and no inspiration put into it. So I just hope that this can be a model for other horror movies and show that there is originality in what was once an almost dead genre.",Insidious
242,med77_99,"Borrows a lot from other films, yet stands out on its own..enjoyable Horror movie",8,29 March 2011,"Just came back from watching an advanced screening of "" Insidious "" tonight with my wife, we both liked it a lot. When it comes to Horror films, there are always the same Horror formulas which film makers really can't escape when making a Horror, because there aren't much they can work with and they are limited to that same formula. So Insidous borrows many of its ideas from other Horror films, one comes to mind is 1982 film "" Poltergeist "", but here we have a family of 5, Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne play the parents of 2 boys and a little baby girl. after a slow build up, a small accident occur and their older son falls into comma or so it seems !! soon after, weird things start to happen at the house and the mother suspects evil spirits are in the house !! A simple story that as i said was done before, however, I thought it was done differently here, there was a better atmosphere and some elements of the plot stood out as being fresh that made this film unique somehow. As scares goes, this was definitely scary, there were several moments in the film that gave me goosebumps !! there were also the classic jump out of your seat moments too. Some scenes were creepy and the mixing of music and sounds were done superbly to add to the Horror. so the movie does deliver as far as scares are concerned.Acting was superb too, all cast involved did a very good job, particularly Rose Byrne whom I'm fond of after watching her in the excellent TV show "" Damages "". Patrick Wilson was also good here.the atmosphere was creepy, the director managed to catch nice footage of the house and other elements of the film. So in summary, get ready and grab your loved ones and go catch this movie this Friday, it entertains. very enjoyable and scary, and even though it borrows ideas from other Horror films, it never imitates, it stand out as a new and fresh take on traditional Horror !!",Insidious

There's a certain jump scare that gets me still to this day. The idea of ""The Further"" is definitely creative. However, elements of it don't work sometimes along with a certain sequence of events.

244,eytand94,Insidious Is....,10,13 August 2011,"There are two kinds of haunted house movies: the one that builds dread and never shows a ghost and the one that takes you on a roller-coaster ride. James Wan's latest horror outing, ""Insidious,"" is a combination of both.Josh and Renai have moved into a new house with their sons, Foster and Dalton, and their baby girl, Cali. Renai is still getting over the nervousness of moving in, but overall, things are going quite well. Until Dalton falls into a sudden coma. That's when things go downhill. Strange voices vibrate off of Cali's baby monitor, loud noises erupt randomly, and Renai begins to see things. Almost certain that their house is haunted, Renai and her husband move into another house. But not even that can stop the terror. And when they invite a group of mediums/ghost hunters, they make the horrifying discovery that it's not the house that's haunted.Next to the important fact that it's from the creators of ""Saw"" and Oren Peli, director of the ingenious fright-fest ""Paranormal Activity,"" produced it, people will mostly recall the advertising campaign for ""Insidious."" A black screen constantly saying ""Insidious is..."" One who has never seen the film can only ask that question. What is ""Insidious?"" I can proudly answer that. It is easily one of the best and creepiest haunted house movies since ""The Others,"" or maybe even ""Poltergeist."" But the film does feel like this generation's ""Poltergeist."" That was James Wan and Leigh Whannell's intention: to make a ghost story that is low-budget, atmospheric, and reminiscent of the classic 80's haunted house films.Despite maybe one happy moment between Josh and Renai and some comedy from the ghost hunters(played by screenwriter Leigh Whannell and Angus Simpson), there is nothing funny about this movie. Right from the opening credits, an immense feeling of eeriness and mood drips off of the film like common horror movie blood. Things start out creepy, and build to a terrific edge-of-seat fright that never flies off of the wheels.While the demented, torturous ghosts(or demons) are extremely scary, especially to look at, it's the more subtle, quiet things in the film that get to me most. There will be moments when something scary is happening, and you barely even notice it. Other times, a chair will rock or a door will slightly open, and a chill is brought down the spine.""Insidious"" is filled to the brim with fantastic acting talent. Patrick Wilson(""Watchmen"" and ""Hard Candy"") and Rose Byrne(""Adam"" and ""Bridesmaids"") are perfect as Josh and Renai, especially Ms. Byrne. She may have been noticed in the horror sequel ""28 Weeks Later,"" but as fun as that movie is, I've always longed to see her make a seriously scary movie. She's done it here, and has proved herself worthy of more jobs in Hollywood in many different genres. Other times, Leigh Whannell, Angus Simpson, and horror mistress Lin Shaye(known best because her father, Robert Shaye, created New Line Cinema, and helped Wes Craven give birth to ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"") nearly steal the show.And then there's the work of director James Wan. His two previous movies, ""Dead Silence""(a fun horror romp) and ""Death Sentence,"" went by without much attention. But everybody knows Wan for ""Saw."" As creative and frightening as that film is, I was a little afraid that Wan would stay labeled as the creator of ""torture porn."" Luckily, he has broken that mold, and shown people that he can easily scare people with atmosphere more than a dude with a weapon. He also pays homage to directors like Tobe Hooper and David Lynch, as well as his first inspiration, Herk Harvey's 1962 film ""Carnival of Souls."" Thanks to this film, things have just gotten better for Wan and his partner, Mr. Whannell.While there are so many more remakes and harsh criticism, even for the more original films or sequels, you might realize that the horror genre is getting better. With movies like ""The Strangers,"" ""Paranormal Activity,"" ""The Last Exorcism,"" ""The Descent,"" and ""Black Swan""(yes, I call it a horror film), the future is bright for fright flicks. And ""Insidious"" has just been added to the list. You'll scream, you'll gasp, you'll quiver with fear. This is a haunted house movie that nobody is going to forget.P.S. If you get freaked out by faces at your window, don't watch this movie.",Insidious
245,theycallmemrglass,Refreshing Old School Scarefest without need for Gore and CGI,8,15 April 2011,"Just seen this at a preview screening in London.From the makers of Saw, this was surprisingly devoid of any gore and instead what we get is a refreshingly old school scare fest, 80s style. No stupid over-used CGI, just good effective camera work and traditional make up effects (akin to that of Sixth Sense).But this film was so similar in structure to one of my favourite 80s scary movie that if I mention what that movie is, I feel I would spoil the whole movie for you! I'm pretty much saying this is an act for act total rip off of that movie. I'm surprised they're not even calling it a remake, or a reboot. But I don't mind the extraordinary similarities as this has its own signature and flavour to win over fans of the ""original"" and definitely will win over those who haven't.Did I jump out of my skin? At least 20 bloody times. At one time I worried if I was too far away to get back in my body. Granted, they are your traditional BOO moments with the sound cranked up to maximum, you know the type but they are pretty damn effective and done with great timing and excellent editing.The audience I saw this with clearly loved the scares whilst dreading it at the same time. It's amusing to find people trying to laugh the scares off and I was one of them, its like a defence mechanism. You know you just got tango'd so what do you do? you try laugh it off!Having said that I think they used that card a bit too many times in the first and second act so it was quite noticeable that later scary moments didn't quite have us jumping out of our seats and in fact some of it fell quite flat.My other gripe was that the last act did not quite reach the urgency of excitement that the film was clearly building to, some more tightening in the editing was needed here. I might have felt that way because I'm uncontrollably comparing it too much to the ""original"". I was also hoping for a little more visual imagination in that last act. But I later found out that this movie was made on a minuscule budget of $800,000. Considering this, they did a damn good job of making use of every penny of it. So it was moderately exciting but not as fulfilling as I would have liked. Even though I think this a clear rip off of an 80s film I love, this delivered exactly what our sadistic inner demons have been crying out for lately, a movie that scares the bejesus out of us. So this is a great movie to watch on a Friday or Saturday night with your friends and for guys with their dates as I guarantee your arms will be sore as your girlfriends grab you violently several times.",Insidious
246,Clintekabor,It's not the house that is Haunted,7,23 November 2020,"I was pleasantly surprised with the direction of this film. It differed slightly from what I was expecting when watching the trailer with me thinking along the lines of a demon possesses the son and it would go down an exorcism path. While there was a fleeting moment in the film however that wasn't the case in the overall story here.Patrick Wilson and Lin Shaye are the ones to watch but it was the M rating that intrigued me in the first place as I had read so many positive reviews about how well the film was executed with plenty of genuine horror moments.Unfortunately it didn't quite reach the level and hype I hoped it would. It was in a lot of ways different in what you would normally expect from a standard possession film which made it all the more pleasingly fresh and I quite liked the astral projection concept.The film is really well paced which gives you honest jump scares and only brief moments to calm down before the next paranormal occurrence keeping you keenly focused on the story and regularly on edge.For the first two thirds of the film the Lambert family moves out of their current residence thinking the paranormal hauntings are linked to their new home. Unfortunately they soon realise that it is in fact their son who is haunted and who takes an entity with him.James Wan does a brilliant job of creating an entertaining story and branches it into three concepts Haunting, Possession and Astral Projection without the need of resorting to cheap scares, heavy violence and a high body count.Some moments in the film feel new and are greatly executed such as the gas mask in the seance scene. Another moment is the smiling family scene which feels like memories and souls of real people trapped in another time.The red faced man could have been the next Horror icon with it's slick movements and Freddy Krueger like claws, the real let down here is when the creature scales the walls with rapid pace chasing the boy and you do notice blatantly obvious CGI which takes away most of the fear and realism and just makes you feel far less terrified of the demon.But overall this does make me interested to want to watch the remainder of the Insidious films and see where the story takes us and for that it was a success.7/10",Insidious

Directing wise the terror scenes were okay but the normal scenes were awful, that camera angles and the fact that the camera was always shaking was really annoying me. I like the fact that they actually moved out when they figured out when they're house was haunted, something that never happens in terror movies and really annoy me and I also liked that there was a terror scene during day time.",Insidious

249,iReviewFilms,Fanaticalaboutfilms Review: Insidious,7,3 May 2011,"Now if there is one thing that freaks me out most in movies it is horrors that involve children in any way. So when I sat down to watch a movie from the guys and gals that have given us Paranormal Activity revolving around the story of a possessed child, well lets just say I had my diaper at the ready!Insidious follows a textbook family, the parents- Josh (Patrick Wilson) and Renai (Rose Byrne) that have it all as they move into their new suburban house with their 3 beautiful children. However all is not as it seems as one of their sons, Dalton (Ty Simpkins), after slipping off a ladder while exploring in the attic falls into a coma. Strange things then begin to happen as objects move, mysterious voices are heard and you catch things in the corner of your eye. After this activity drives them from their new home they enlist the help of a paranormal psychic Elise (Lin Shaye) and the horrifying truth becomes evident. It is not the house but Dalton that is haunted! As with most horror movies, I find they only tend to scare me until I know what I'm up against ie. keep the monster hidden and let the suspense/not knowing get me grabbing for my cushion. This movie was similar in that respect with the majority of the scares coming in the first two thirds before it began to fall away slightly. This was more than enough though and will give you the jumps that you are looking for if you decide to go and see it.Considering what the trailer gives us, I was quite surprised that it took so long to get to the realisation that it was in fact the boy that was possessed rather than where they were living. It is a good 50 minutes to an hour before this is realised which irked me somewhat.The inclusion of the two bickering paranormal activity assistants was a well thought out idea as it gave a break from trying to scare you, injecting a bit of comedy into the fray and enabled the audience to be lulled into a more relaxed state so that when the next scare came you were off guard and less than ready for it.Apart from the scary evil entities, horrors are made or broken by the music or lack thereof that accompanies the suspense and the cinematography. Insidious does not disappoint. The music leads to the creation of an intense tension that stays with you throughout most of the movie and lingers after it finishes and the cinematography is also top notch.Insidious does serve up moments of actual horror that had me keeping an eye out for anything out of the ordinary several hours after the film had finished. It is a far cry from James Wan (director) and Leigh Whannell (writer) other collaborations of the Saw series and despite using a tried and tested framework, they made the movie original. It will probably be one of the better horror movies that's released this year but then again, I doubt there will be much competition.For further reviews feel free to check out: http://www.fanaticalaboutfilms.com",Insidious

Blood splattered all around is gross but not scary. Most movies have a few but this one is really creepy. Lots of jump-out-of-your-seat scares. This one is right up there at the top.Good story and well acted. There were a couple of characters I would rather had been left on the cutting room floor but they were minor and not a big bother.You want to watch this one with the lights ON. I watched it in the afternoon and don't scare easily but this one did it for me. Don't want to see it at night.More, please! Rock solid (usually) Mikey",Insidious

252,LordJiggy,"A well-done ""homage"" to Poltergeist",6,14 July 2013,"Homage or ripoff, you decide. But it owes a great deal to Poltergeist, from its suburban setting to the strained domestic situation between the two leads, Rose Bryne (always believable) and Patrick Wilson (dependable, as well). The big difference is the location of the haunting, which was pretty clever. As this was a low-budget film, the writer and director couldn't cover up story holes with more CG. The scares as sharp and surprising, making nice use of silence, the shadows, and the supporting actors, who do a good job of conveying reality to some pretty unrealistic situations. Fairly eerie make-up, too.Only two failings, and one was budgetary: when the spirits put in a final appearance at the end, they looked far too solid --- again, no money for fancy CGI. But the other was a real failure of writing, that is, the ""twist"" ending. Most of us watching horror films know there is going to be a twist, and we're expecting it. Part of the beauty of a twist ending is that you are surprised. But since it's now considered a requirement, then is no surprise, no matter how allegedly clever the ""twist.""",Insidious
253,cb_whitewood,It's a movie.,4,28 June 2021,"Every twist you can guess, this movie has. It's well-produced, but that's not enough to make it an engaging watch. I found the family to be very dull and a Hollywood cookie-cutter sort, and while the demon was very visually interesting, there just wasn't enough for me to enjoy this film. The twists at the end are great, but don't make up for everything that comes before. Probably better suited for those who haven't seen a lot of horror movies.",Insidious
254,SoverniX,The tension is growing by the minute...,9,5 February 2021,"I can't remember when I actually watched a horror movie. Shivering, getting goosebumps, and feeling my heart pounding. From childhood, I remember the popular films about Freddy Krueger at that time. At the age of 12, I experienced fear when viewing the picture ""Others""...In recent years, a special reaction to mystical thrillers and just horror films has not been noticed. Today's browsing brought me back to those forgotten emotions that I fell asleep at once...I liked the film and ... iconic or not, I watched it on the day when it was on the calendar... Friday, the 13th... I will not talk about the plot and its criticism. I have taken up this comment only to note the fact described above. Yes, I was genuinely scared and throughout the tape remained immersed in the mystical atmosphere of what was happening.It wasn't even the boy who was causing the most alarm, but his mother. The boy, as it seemed to me, did not play quite naturally. And here's Mom...P. S. the Film, it would be interesting to see again on the big screen and with sound.9/10",Insidious
255,unemployedvirgin,good film even though i predicted the ending,8,3 December 2011,"when this film came out there was a huge buzz around its material since the work stems from the SAW writer and director. being a huge fan of that classic series i was always interested what the duo would come up with next. an impressive movie is spawned, good choice of child actors and an all rounded mystery spoof made it worthwhile.now there's the negative..overuse of basic sound effects such as a screeching door or the eerie creaks of floorboards made me feel less invested. the fear factor was surprisingly minimal in comparison to the standards i've adored in the past with the likes of James wan. in some of the quick shots (that's the best two worded phrase i can use to describe them) there's a poor use of camera work that makes it go from your standard cinematic look to some low budget poop. the creature that possessed the child has a striking resemblance to Darth maul (and this is coming from a non star wars fan) from the skin tone, clothing and pigmentation, a skinnier version to be more specific only with goat hoofs (i'm guessing that's to give a more neolithic Satan look?).although i myself do not believe in the supernatural as i'm an atheist, at least this movie challenged my perception somewhat in dealing with the subject matter of astral travelling. granted i've trashed it quite a lot with it's flaws as you read above, with that said the plot did thicken from time to time and it's not like i wanted to tune out in boredom.so in conclusion? depending on your personal standpoint of film knowledge or how far your willing to be a ""believer"" plays a big part in how much or how little you enjoy this piece. for me, i just hope Leigh (who by the way had a hilarious role) and James come up with something unique in the future like their previous accomplishments instead of being 1 hit wonder inventors that end up going down the ""spooky Jesus"" avenue of predictable outcomes. *cough cough* Toby hooper *cough cough*As always..take it as you will.",Insidious

At 51 there's not much that scares me in the way of movies since I've seen about every scary movie that's been made, but ""Insidious"" raised the bar and did it with a lot of heart.I can always be reassured of the entertainment value in a movie based on the caliber of actors who choose to be in that movie, and since Barbara Hershey signed on I knew I was in for something with depth and meaning as well as a unique way to tell a ghost story which this movie is and much more. It's how I chose ""The Black Swan"" another of Barbara Hershey's which I also thoroughly enjoyed. Smart actors like Barbara and Robert Duvall, Gene Hackman and others of the same caliber have never disappointed me in the movies they've chosen throughout the years they've been around.Let me just say this movie's portrayal of the paranormal is so uniquely creepy, tense and realistic in ambiance, timing and photography that it's a big notch above Paranormal Activity. I constantly got chills over my entire body literally with how its presented. And the plot is so unique with a great surprise ending.",Insidious
257,user-543-975655,"I've Seen It 10 Times, It Still Scares Me!",8,1 November 2013,"I saw the second Insidious a couple weeks ago, and I thought I would re- watch this one. I am still scared every time! I know what's coming, but it still gets me each time I watch it. Oh, by the way, I reviewed the second one, so you should go check that out. This film is absolutely terrifying, and I think it deserved an *Oscar*. I don't know if it did, but I'll probably check later. The movie was completely awesome the whole way through. It was scary, and realistic. It was funny, at times, and was filled with awesome special effects. Takashi Shimizu, an Asian director, believes that the more special effects you have, the less real the movie looks. I think the same philosophy is applied here, and there is only one moment where they used special effects. That only added to the realness. I thought the acting was awesome, and just like the second, believable. Even little Foster Lambert, who is played by a boy named... I don't know. But he was good. Rose Byrne was good as well, but nothing really outstanding. Patrick Wilson, as always, did such a good job, it's a shame he hasn't been in more horror films. He's been in his fair share, but this is where he really stands out. In this movie, he plays a lovable dad, with humor, compassion. Lin Shaye does a memorable job as Elise Rainier, and one that cannot be replaced by another actress. Barbara Hershey did ab as always wonderful job as Lorraine Lambert. You can probably replace her, but it won't be easy. Even Joseph Bishara, who didn't have one line as the Lipstick-Faced Demon, because he was so agile and strong and scary looking. Leigh Whannell and Angus Sampson were the writers and producers, but also made an exceptional duo as Specs and Tucker. They were the only people who kept the movie light when it wasn't scary, which was a good idea. This is one of the only movies that I can watch and be genuinely scared of, unlike Paranormal Activity or Boogeyman. That movie was just terrible. I thought that James Wan's directing style is unique, and weird, but in a completely good way. He uses the instant scene change technique, and also the dread technique, meaning he does more jump scares than a lot of people, and also can kill you in suspense more than anyone else I know about. I was shocked that people 10 years older than me can't sleep after watching this. It is very scary, but I had no problem going to sleep. As I said before, James Wan is a very skillful director, and I want to see more of his movies. He directed Saw I and III, but I don't plan on seeing those any time soon. The story was pretty generic and original at the same time. The generic side is that there are a bunch of ghosts hanging around, and on the original side, the son falls into a coma and a big elaborate process tries to save him. That wasn't a spoiler, was it? Anyway, the music was extremely different, but in a completely good way. It has sense of terror every time it plays, and when it plays, you KNOW something is going to happen. They really are disgusting. Brief recap: Acting-awesome. Effects- awesome. Story-pretty cool. Music-extremely scary. That was my review of Insidious, I think you should go see it, if you like really scary movies, and see ya!",Insidious
258,joben-525-633946,"A little to unrealistic to haunt you with nightmares, but still very scary.",7,22 December 2012,"Director of 'Saw' and 'Paranormal Activity' James Wan returns to the horror genre with an at times, intensely frightening paranormal movie which is undone by a few too many over-the-top moments which make the movie unrealistic and the scare factor evaporates.Let me elaborate. The first half of the movie is chillingly scary and builds up atmospheric tension superbly. The second half of the film is a little disappointing and it is much less scary in comparison to the first half of the film, other than the occasional shudder in the movie's climax.Josh Wilson (Patrick Wilson) is a teacher who's family moves into a new but spacious modern day home. However, he and his wife's life (Rose Byrne) is made a living hell when son Dalton (Ty Simpkins) is being possessed by an evil spirit cult, leaving him in a coma like state.The story is gripping and the acting is consistently excellent from each casting member. Patrick Wilson is particularly good as the desperate father willing to attempt anything to save his son; his performance has an emotional presence and he portrays a realistic microcosm as a man in this particular situation.Overall, I found 'Insidious' - at its best - a terrifying and well executed piece on the shoe string budget at its disposal. However, as the scare's begin to evaporate, so does the realism and the idea's become a little loose.Probably deserved of a score of seven.",Insidious
259,enigmaticmaniac,Scary but not great,7,30 July 2011,"From the moment I saw the trailer I was pretty much into it as it looked scary. Moreover James Wan is the one directing which makes it a must. Well frankly this was a lowdown from dead silence for me. Wan is the person who cleverly places a brilliant twist in the end which makes the movie being rated higher. Its not quite the same thing here. Initially the moment movie starts you're gonna get a hint that this is gonna be scary as hell. The music, the makeups everything adds to the creepy scenario. Actually its scary in places and you might get jumpy. However towards the later part of the movie it feels stupid script-wise. I guess they needed a better script. The direction is in his own style again. Some humor have also been added which makes it more creepy. It could have been much better that's what I feel. Anyways as the matter of fact, its definitely gonna scare you no matter what, so go for it.",Insidious
260,Parks,Drag Me Back To Hell Again,6,29 April 2011,"Insidious is a magpie of a horror movie that steals ideas from other classics and weaves them together to make a fun movie - even if it will seem familiar to any horror movie fan.The opening is J-horror-ish with The Grudge-ey type spooks inhabiting the house of a young family coping with the fact that one of their children has gone into an inexplicable coma. We then move to ""Poltergeist"" territory as the family brings in kooky help to help rid them of the presence in their home and finally, the film evokes ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" in the last (and weakest) part of the film as those things which lurked in the shadows are finally exposed (and are frankly kind of disappointing).But even with all these influences, the film it reminded me of most is Sam Raimi's ""Drag Me To Hell"" another movie that threw shock after scare at the viewers, contrasting eerie quiet with LOUD in an effort to lift the audience of its seat in unison. And just like DMTH, the impact is spoiled a little by a ""twist"" you will have predicted easily unless you have never seen a movie before everIt's this over-familiarity that stops this movie from being more than a scary ride. It is a fun ride while it lasts but once it's over it will soon be forgotten.",Insidious

Some truly scare the barnacles of you scenes, especially the figures lurking in the shadows type effects. Not all the frights happen at night. There are moments of humour, thank god, as they give you brief respite from the chills.The acting is pretty good really, especially the husband and wife.

262,Dfschohr-532-549658,Insidious,8,17 November 2013,"Leigh Whannell, and James Wan have the knack for the low-budget, suspenseful storytelling. They proved it with Saw(the original) and Dead Silence, which may be more cheesy then I had liked. But now comes their third theatrical film together, Insidious. Their take on the worn- out haunted house, ghost stories. The film stars Rose Byrne as Renai, and Patrick Wilson as Josh they are a married couple who have three kids, Dalton(11), Foster(6), and Callie(baby), and they are trying to get settled in their new house. Weird occurrences begin to happen around the house, sending Renai into a panic, so they decided to move. Their son Dalton has fallen into a coma, and they are able to take care of him from home. More weird occurrences take place, that involve Renai seeing demonic creatures. So they decide to call in ghost hunters, one played by Leigh Whannell, and they begin to explain Astro Projection. Which basically is an out of body experience while you sleep, and their son has gone to far into the world they call, ""The Further"" How will they get him out? I might have given you more information then you would have liked, but it is so hard to describe this movie because its very slow, it builds tension and when it goes for a scare it gets you. It only fails within the showing of ""The Further"". But I blame that on their budget. This film soars above so many recent horror films that have been released within the passed few years. I can't wait to see it again. I give Insidious a 8 out of 10.",Insidious
263,waterman_harry,Worthy Start to An Influential Franchise,8,26 April 2015,"A worthy start to an influential franchise, the supreme mix of Wan and Whannell proves to blend enough ghouls and grime to result in a fun film. Byrne fits the ""contemporary stone-faced worrier"" of a mother horror archetype that seems so popular nowadays and she does rather well as the tired-eyed parent of a young boy in a coma, who seems to be attracting the tormented and often disfigured demons who inhabit a distant realm. Patrick Wilson balances her out well with the warmth of the father-figure and also gives a good performance as a genuinely concerned and worried parent. The use of colour borrows heavily from the work of Argento and thats a good thing, smearing our worst nightmares in candy-coloured paint, contrasting to the bleakness of the real world. The main demon antagonist is a little kooky though and depending on its audience will definitely inspire a few unintentional laughs.",Insidious

265,alexart-1,Insidious is Truly Insidious,9,17 April 2011,"How many horror movies are actually scary? Three, maybe four? Make that five. Insidious just made the list.James Wan's Insidious is unusual in every sense of the word. It's a 100-minute thrill ride that is a homage to countless horror movies, including Poltergeist and The Shining, and often enough, Insidious succeeds in bringing the scares. Terrifying and entertaining, Insidious threatens its viewer with an insulting amount of jump scares, however it does not matter when the result is this good. Popcorn entertainment may not be this fun again for a while.Insidious' plot may sound contrived, and that's because it is. Leigh Whanell's original script borrows a lot of previous horror greats. Renai (Rose Byrne) and Josh Lambert (Patrick Wilson) are a married couple with three children that have just moved into a new house. Yet not everything is perfect. The protagonists' marriage is tense and cold and there's something deeply unsettling about their home. It isn't long before one of their sons, Dalton, falls from a ladder while he is investigating a noise in the attic and becomes comatose. The house isn't done with the Lamberts yet. And the filmmakers aren't done with us either.Wan shows a clear sense of maturity with Insidious. That is to say that he has stepped it up from the bloody albeit twisty Saw and the boring Dead Silence. Insidious alludes to past horror masterpieces frequently, and after all, isn't copying the sincerest form of flattery? Wan uses all this to his advantage--Insidious becomes creaky, slow carnival ride that never lets up. Wan has clearly learned from the masters; now he's just showing off.As if Insidious' atmospheric tone wasn't enough, Wan has made Insidious a textbook example of horror done right. Lighting is used to create intrigue and mystery; the camera whirls and shakes to give the film an unsettling dissonance. Often Insidious verges on corny, but this is all with good intent. Violins certainly hit the high notes to give the viewer chills.But Insidious is far from perfect. In fact, Wan's film is still marred by many flaws, notably a tonal change about halfway through that nearly wrecks any momentum gained in the quiet first act. It also seems that every two minutes there is a jump scene. This is a something that works at first, but by the end of it, it gets to be a bit much. And while there is some much needed comic relief in some of the scariest parts, it doesn't quite hang together when jokes are made. Furthermore, some elements of the plot are nonsensical, yet all this can be missed when disbelief is suspended.In 2009, Paranormal Activity was hailed as one of the scariest movies ever. It's time for Insidious to get the recognition it deserves. Insidious may not be everyone's type of horror movie, but it's an intelligent, scary, and well-made film designed for people who actually care about watching movies. Although Insidious may take itself way too seriously, it's hard to ignore a film that is so intensely scary as this. There's one scene where Lorraine, played by Barbra Hershey, says, ""I had a dream last night. I was in the house. I was very afraid."" Aren't we all, darling.",Insidious

There was actually good chemistry and a good storyline somewhere... the movie itself felt quite ""by the numbers"" though. There were jump scares, but not too many or too annoying ones .. little shaky cam and overall a suspenseful atmosphere .. quite appreciated.There is not much i outstanding i can say about this movie, but also nothing dreadful. It was a good time that did not disappoint. But was it scary? .. Maybe i am a bit numb for those horror movies (i am more affected by suspense and ""strangeness"" than outright scares) .. so no.. it was not scary .. at all.

Insidious is to The conjuring, what Paranormal activity is to the Exorcist. Despite both being made by the same director and starring the same lead actor, they are worlds apart. While The Conjuring had slow scenes which you watched because it moved the film along and added tension, the slow scenes in Insidious had me drifting off in boredom. The budget of the Conjuring was obviously a great deal more than Insidious but more than that, Insidious had the overall feel of a music video or a bad trip. Some scenes were comedic,not intentionally. I won't spoil the ending but will say James Wan diffidently learned from his mistakes. If your looking for a film so bad it's good, this is for you, if you want a film you might actually find engrossing go for the conjuring.I'd like to add that this has a sequel, heaven knows why, although it lends support to the theory that sequels are made not because a film is good but because it sells well, they are not the same thing.",Insidious
268,guillermobosque,"In spite of its messy final act, Insidious is clever, well-acted and suspenseful.",7,11 January 2015,"Summary: In spite of its messy final act, Insidious is clever, well- acted and suspenseful. 73/100 (B)Insidious is a low-budget horror film directed by James Wan. The first act of the movie looks like Paranormal Activity 2 (without the found-footage), but after the first 25 minutes it becomes more original and some scary stuff start to happen. Wan directs very well, the movie boasts a nicely handled suspense, especially in its first act. In addition, it has terrific sound effects. The acting is superb, Rose Byrne and Patrick Wilson were great in their roles. The two main characters performed by Byrne and Wilson were believable and very well developed. Insidious is a spooky, well-acted flick and probably Wan's first good film.As I said above, the plot is refreshing and the scares are effective. The characters are well developed and some of them are funny (in a good way), a great example are the two male paranormal experts, both play a hilarious role without being annoying. The film scares you with some creepy noises and unexpected images. Its final act keeps the tension although it's a bit weak in comparison to the last two acts. During its final act there is a scene where this demon is revealed. It was very surprising for me, the demon itself looks very scary and that whole scene was so terrifying.On the upside, Insidious has some thrilling scenes, good performances and unexpected scares; also, its second half is strangely original. James Wan is a director with experience in the genre and creates here a truly scary atmosphere that is reinforced with strong performances by Rose Byrne, Patrick Wilson and Lin Shaye. I also liked the camera work, this movie has lots of creepy shots and a good illumination too. See this film if you're a fan of the genre or if you're interested on seeing a strange, weird ass horror film. Also if you like jump-scares. Insidious is a jump-scare fest, a very good one.On the downside, its final act is strange, sometimes confusing and it almost ruined the whole film for me. During its first half, the movie kept the suspense and delivered lots of scares; however, in its final minutes the suspense was totally gone and the movie was not as terrifying as it was before. I liked it anyway, the whole production design is awesome and the special effects are well done in spite of being a low-budget flick. In conclusion, Insidious is a great, scary flick that boasts a creepy demon and originality. My only issue is the final act, it's such a mess. (B)",Insidious

270,IheartCali5882,Don't expect to be scared....Expect a good movie,7,10 April 2011,"Inisidious is not particularly scary, but let's be honest. 90% of horror films don't scare us anymore. If that's what it takes for you to give a thumbs up to a movie, then this won't be the movie for you. Nevertheless, it's well made and well acted. It's a simple retelling of the haunted house genre, that's not about the house. In this case, the house has some unwanted inhabitants because of this family's little boy who is being surrounded by evil deities. I won't go into the explanation for why this is. One, because it's too cheesy to be believed, and two because it would take too long.Aside from that, I still enjoyed the film. The entire movie consists of BOO! moments. I admit I jumped several times, but towards the end I became a little desensitized. What made Insidious work for me is two things. Because I never knew what was going to pop out at any given time, I was always on the edge of my seat. Second, Rose Byrne as the main character was believable and sympathetic. With a lesser actress, I probably wouldn't have enjoyed it half as much.So you have-Pros: Exceptional acting, good pacing, spooky atmosphere, good heroine, ending with a twist Cons: Those ""jump"" moments become repetitive, explanation for the haunting is kind of hokey and borderline ridiculousBetter than average, but becomes repetitive and predictable at times. 6.5/10",Insidious

272,samtko-04675,It's ok,6,11 September 2019,"Firstly before someone curses at me for the rating my true rating is more of a 6.5/10.
Secondly I will say I'm a very big fan of James Wan, I support all his work and think he is a very talented person.
Now onto the review, this movie starts out like a haunted house film, and it does a decent job at having an eerie feeling it's nothing too original and it's pretty cheesy but it's fun.... then it gets muddled, they add a strange twist that it's the son that is an astro projector and his empty vessel has attracted a bunch of spirits and demons, then come to find out the father is one too and has to pull his son out, it gets very muddled. Despite this it is still an ok movie and kinda fun, however I think it's one of Wan's lesser works.
I still recommend it for a few viewings",Insidious
273,ashecatlin,Better the second time round,7,17 October 2020,"So I watched this a while ago and absolutely hated it, I ended up watching the 4th one and really enjoyed it so I gave this a second shot.I'm not sure I would rate this as a horror movie, as I kept on laughing throughout. There are just so many things that tickle me, like the ghosts one of them straight up looks like an old age vampire. When he's attacking people it's supposed to be scared but it just came off as funny to me, there are so many scenes where this is supposed to be really suspenseful but I just found it hilarious. It's not a bad movie, in fact I really enjoyed watching it. Time flew by, even though I remember the ending and the big plot points.The big bad is a perfect example of why this film is so funny, he starts off as a creepy silhouette, which works. But they keep going back to him and making him more absurd as the movie goes on, like the second time he has darth maul face paint. Then he gets a Freddy claw, then a tail and finally a really bad CGI crawl on a wall. It just made the whole thing silly,Again this was well worth a second watch, just keep in mind it's not quite a horror movie. Patrick Wilson was incredible in this though, thoroughly enjoyed watching him throughout, the rest of the cast were pretty good to.",Insidious
274,zanghi_james,Solidly Spooky and Satisfying Haunting from the Further,8,30 October 2021,"James Wan, lately, has been a mixed bag for me in regards to his growing catalogue of films. I am not a fan of the Conjuring Universe films. Most of the ones I have seen could have been much better, but that's another thing altogether. The Saw series I couldn't watch because it was so horrifically sick with imagery, and I have yet to watch his pre-Insidious films nor Furious Seven or Malignant, though I found Aquaman to be incredible and am eagerly awaiting its sequel.Now, I had seen Insidious when it first came out on DVD, so I knew the story when I just recently re-watched it prior to posting this review. I think it's probably one of the better films that Wan has done. Right from the beginning, the movie just gets under your skin and brings the spooky and creepy disturbing imagery, which is only enhanced by the nightmarish and otherworldly score by by the mutli-talented Joseph Bishara. At times, though, the jittery and screechy violins used all over the score made me feel a little uncomfortable and squirm, like I had ants crawling under my skin.The acting is really good, too, and that is where this story shines. Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne have great chemistry together here, plus the two boys who play their children do a good job. Lin Shaye is odd but quite interesting as the mysterious medium and paranormal investigator Elise Rainier, while script-writer Leigh Whannell and Angus Sampson evoke imagery (at least in my mind) of Dan Akroyd and Harold Ramis in Ghostbusters. Barbara Hershey's character is also far more easy-to-like than her bizarre performance in Black Swan, which I think is the only other movie I have really seen her in. The actors who play the Ghosts are creepy as heck, and Joseph Bishara is terrifying as the bizarre demon looking to possess Dalton.Visually, this movie has some of the most unique camerawork I've seen in a horror, which is great because I remember hearing that James Wan likes to experiment with camerawork. The special effects are relatively fine and age well and look alright on a Blu-Ray disc. But what really sells this movie is that you can feel for the Lambert family. From the beginning when they finish moving into their new house at first, they are exhausted and hoping for a better experience than what they have had before. However, as Dalton falls into his coma-like situation, you can rapidly see the family starting to fall apart and the tension rise. Then you add in the repeated appearances by the ghosts and ghoulies, you just can't help but think to yourself that the Lamberts got dealt a really raw hand.My only real other complaints about the film is that cliffhanger of an ending. For anyone who hasn't seen it, it's quite the shocker, but also it is a little annoying since you then have to watch at least Chapter Two of Insidious to get more answers because it ends so abruptly. It was more annoying when I first saw it, since I realized I would have to wait for Wan to make Insidious 2 and, at the time, I didn't know how long a wait that would be. However, now that I have all the films in my collection, It's far less annoying.One other criticism I have to mention is that it really focuses on the Lambert family and Elise's team trying to help them. However, It seems like they don't interact with really anyone or have any friends or colleagues who could help them through such a terrible ordeal as well. There could have been a few more characters appearing to help Josh and Renai save Dalton, in other words.Well, whether you like a good spooky film or a Blumhouse Production in general or James Wan, I recommend you check out Insidious. And if you have seen it already, then don't you think you should watch it again?Stay Scared!",Insidious

By switching progagonists halfway through from frightened mom, Renai, to traumatized dad, Josh, the film loses its focus, spiraling out of control into a convoluted mishmash of clunky exposition, eerie supernatural tableaus, campy villains, and bizarre ghost hunting tecnhiques. While many conceptual and visual elements of the film remain creepy, its generic shock based soundscape and choatic final act undermine the tension of the first part of the film.",Insidious

It had justified jump scares, a creepy premise, a genuinely disturbing soundtrack, and creepy ghosts to top it off. But it's a bit of wasted potential. There were moments I almost laughed at some of the CG and the narrative becomes a little too unbelievable as well. But when compared to more recent films like The Nun or La Llorona, this movie is a more than a cut above.",Insidious
278,tonynworah,Insidiously scary,8,10 January 2012,"I sat down to watch this movie INSIDIOUS with mixed feelings. I love horror films nut recently Hollywood, has been churning out thrash in this genre with few notable exceptions like THE DESCENT. Even the much over hyped PARANORMAL ACTIVITY seemed to me to be a boring experiment in cinematography.Then a film like INSIDIOUS comes along to breath a fresh air into the genre and revitalized a story telling style of haunted homes that is reminiscent of the old horror movies.Its greatest strength perhaps is that it does not rely on gore, surprising considering that the director is James Wan who made his directorial mark in the hyper bloody and extremely gory SAW. Script writer Leigh Whannel creates a story about a family that moves into a cute old fashioned house to begin a new life. Soon, odd things, spectacles, noises, begin to occur which makes Renai Lambert, the matriarch start to suspect that the house is haunted. Suspicion becomes conviction after her son falls inexplicably into coma. Faced with baffled doctors and a semi-skeptical husband, she is forced to force the truth of the horror that her family is about to face. Anyone with even a passive interest in horror will see the clichés in INSIDIOUS. The afflicted child, the haunted house, the distraught mother (not the father), the hair rising music. We have seen them all in such movies like THE EXORCIST, THE UNBORN, HAUNTED, etc. But in INSIDIOUS, the clichés are refreshingly told with a simplicity and a style that makes you hooked right from the spooky credits (again reminiscent of old movies style) to the heart stopping conclusion. And unlike in other horror movies, halfway through the movie, the couple decides to do the most sensible thing a family will do in real life if confronted with an inexplicable evil in their own house instead of waiting till all the family members are killed.Both the director and the writer deserve a lot of credit for this outstanding horror piece. Rose Byrne was good as the distraught mother who would believe anything to save the son's life. So was Patrick Wilson who at first is hesitant in accepting a supernatural explanation for what was happening to their son. Their acting was not really outstanding but still good enough to support a low budget horror movie. (It had a reportedly budget of $1.5m and grossed over $50). Great scary movie.",Insidious
279,peteranderson975,Poltergeist remade as a horror film?,7,25 June 2011,"A family moving into a new house are disturbed by strange things happening. When their son falls into a coma they need to look for help from paranormal investigation team.That short synopsis makes this film sound like Poltergeist and it's hard to avoid the comparison. But Poltergeist was big flashy special effects extravaganza and this film is much more subtle. The scares come the from mysterious noises and the sudden appearance of things such as a face at a window and bloody hand-prints on sheets. My biggest jump scare came from the appearance of a red-faced demon just behind Patrick Wilson's headI thought the film was very good at building up the tension through the first two-thirds of the film. Rose Byrne and Patrick Wilson really were very convincing as the desperate parents trying to get help for their son. Lin Shaye was lot less bizarre as the medium brought into to help than the unearthly Zelda Rubenstein in Poltergeist, at least she was until she put a strange gas mask to talk to spirits. Perhaps the rush of events just left no room for the quiet tension that was so effective earlier and the last third of the film was a bit of let-down. Despite that is still a very good film and I think it is better than Poltergeist, especially as horror film.Rating 7/10",Insidious

I thought there won't be anything that could possibly beat these two but I was wrong. Insidious is terrifying in every way possible. It just creeps you out. The sound, the story , the characters.

There are some impressive moments of lighting vs framing, but it doesn't flow, and becomes too fantastical and mystical to be grounded and real. The climax conflicts with the main body of the film, where it is attempting to ground the surreal and paranormal, but then sends the world of Insidious into a ""hell-ish"" scene which is so flamboyant, it is more comedic than horrific. Insidious falls victim to showing too much of the shadowy villain, and leaves little to be desired. With so little left to the imagination, it becomes more boring than anything else.",Insidious

Most people who didn't like the film have noted that at seems that it was two movies stuck together, with the first half having some nice chills, and a certain level of tension, but the second half being a typical mish mash of reused horror clichés. I concur.Other reviewers also have noted that American horror movies show too much. This is also a valid criticism. In almost all horror movies, once you know the nature of the evil, and once the protagonist moves ""beyond fear"", all horror is gone, and then it usually just becomes an action/adventure movie, with fights, chases and loud noises. This is exactly what happens in this movie. Finally, it uses too many stock horror movie clichés:The shadowy figure that moves across the room, initially out of the line of sight of the characters.The husband who doesn't take the supernatural situation seriously, even though he has seen all the objects in the kids room move at their own volition.And finally, worst of all, the possession, in the final scene, ensuring a sequel.

289,tomsters,some effective scary moments but to much taking from other scary movies to call itself original,6,22 April 2013,"i find it very hard to be scared or shocked when i can see them coming. it doesn't matter what kind of movie really, the older i get the more I've seen the harder it is to see something original.i was surprised at some of the attempts to shock or scare me and they were very effective. but all i all, i have seen this movie in to many other movies that in themselves may not have been all that original either. i guess that would depend how old i was when i saw, say, poltergeist and how many movies I've seen before. yes, it very obviously stole from that movie. a child being used to get the message across to the living from the ghosts, and mommy, this time daddy, going into the other realm to get baby back. i found it a bit amusing to see Barbara Hershey in a movie about a ghost that follows the victim from house to house as in the 1982 movie she stared in, the entity, supposedly based on a true story.many reviews cite many movies that have been borrowed from that i have not seen or even heard of. thats just shameful. there is only so much borrowing you can do without calling it a remake of some sort even if its remaking several movies at once. even at that, some of the scares were scary, not all, but some. then again i was tired and getting shocked out of my sleep only helped the effect of the shock and i cant re-watch it to see if the shock is just as effective now that I'm wide awake. and no, the movie was not so boring it put me to sleep at the end of a very long day. star wars would have put me to sleep then.",Insidious

It also takes a lot from the movie Poltergeist (1982), in its characters, plot and basic premise, so if you're familiar with that it will feel rather derivative.However, it adds many completely unique ideas of its own, eschews flashy special effects and cheap jump scares for some simple yet highly effective theatrical methods that are unnerving because they are so right yet so wrong, and takes us on a haunting journey through some truly creepy scenes with solid direction that never gets clumsy or obvious.It also has really great skin tingling sound that at times flickers around your ears in the most disturbing fashion, and when sudden loud noises happen they are never unqualified by what is going on onscreen.So please look past the at times distracting digital errors that pop up in some scenes and enjoy an otherwise great scary movie.",Insidious
292,thefadingcam,A dreadful modern chiller with a classic touch,6,11 December 2013,"James Wan's ""Insidious"" borrows, like almost every Hollywood horror flick, the clichés, jump scares, and ideas from all the commercial horror movies from the past decades. However, it manages to successfully build a mysterious, eerie and dreadful atmosphere. Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne headline a cast that delivers a good portrait of the haunted family with a first half that sets the bar high, very high, that will leave you at the edge of the seat and afraid of dark. The final act tough begins too soon and drags for too long, taking the movie through a fantasy outcome that is doubtful and perhaps too literal.

Frankly, I found the creepiest thing about this movie to be the dark-haired little brother. But oh, they will probably be using him in the sequel. I really dislike it when a movie sets up its own franchise. That was perhaps unique back in 1980 with Nightmare on Elm Street. but it's old hat now.All the dad had to say was ""Hey, he looks like Darth Maul. You know he got killed, right?""

However, I was enthralled then badly let down. It reminded me of Jeepers Creepers because of the great first half and dreadful second. The first held of the film creates the idea nicely and we work out the different characters and their issues. The boy's fall is handled well and his false coma explained. Then the scares come and they are well done and it reaches the inevitable angst of the parents. A little unneeded humour is added with the paranormal investigators but that is where the film starts getting sillier and your interest wains. Firstly the gas masks - why? Then the inevitable tag-line - it is not your house but your son and it is explained where he is etc and I thought let's forget the silliness and get back to the dread and fear. But the music and feel of the other zone is ruined by the people on the sofa and then the dreadful old style rendition of Tiptoe through the Tulips. Why as it just totally destroyed all tension. And the ending was lazy and totally unsatisfactory. Great idea, good first half but poor second and totally unsatisfactory ending. Don't make a sequel. Just make a better ghost story.",Insidious
295,znegative,Another piece of Hollywood Garbage,2,13 July 2016,"Is it just me, or do mainstream, Hollywood horror films nowadays suck? I'll start this off by saying it's very possible it's me-after all, I've seen pretty much nothing but rave reviews for movies like Insidious, Sinister, The Conjuring 2 and The Purge, and I've hated them all. In fact, hate is too strong a word for it requires a certain level of passion that I cannot find myself to waste on garbage like this, which I find incredibly boring. (Before ending this paragraph, I will say that I did like the first Conjuring, but I digress...).The story here is extremely basic and cliché. The eldest male child in a young family falls from a ladder and subsequently into a coma. The mother starts to experience strange anomalies in the house, things out of place, moving chairs, and more of the like...At her wits end she does what any woman desperate for answers would do in a rational world...Seek out the aid of paranormal investigators and psychics! Soon it is discovered that her soon is a master at 'Astral Projection', and is not really in a coma, but rather, trapped in a dangerous dimension where an 'insidious' spirit is attempting to usurp his body. Just so happens his father (Patrick Wilson) was once a master at 'Astral Projection' as well, and in order to save his son, has to travel to the same dark dwelling where malicious spirits lurk, and bring his child back before and inevitable case of possession occurs.Now, that synopsis could probably prove appropriate for 90% of the supernatural/'horror' films that have come out in the last ten years. I couldn't help while watching it but think, 'My god, I could have written this script when I was 12 years old!'I initially had become interested in Insidious because so many reviewers made claims that it was perhaps the 'most terrifying film of the decade', and what with a PG-13 rating, I became interested because it obviously had to rely on tactics other than gore to so thoroughly 'frighten' the 'herd'. Maybe the vast majority of the population who watched Insidious aren't really die hard horror fans like myself, but even so, I was fighting to keep myself awake, THAT's how incredibly boring and dull I found this film.A lot of the positive reviews praise 'Insidious' for its use of 'sound' and 'disturbing imagery'. I suppose there referring to the screeching violins and smiling men and women in corpse paint. I mean, the thing is so cliché that if I were to teach a class on how to make an unoriginal, and boring horror movie, I would choose 'Insidious' and 'Sinister' as first pick candidates to display the finer points of boring the audience with conventional and lame techniques to 'scare' weak minded people.I guess I shouldn't really be surprised. All the good horror movies seem to be coming out of Spain, France or Britain nowadays, and the few that come out of the United States are indie flicks like 'Dead Girl' or 'Excision'. The days of classics like 'Hellraiser', 'Alien' and 'Event Horizon' are clearly long gone. Hollywood's found out what makes money-cheap thrills and forgettable plots...Oh and apparently Patrick Wilson helps too.",Insidious

The concept of the story was recycled heavily, as were its scares. I found myself bored to tears waiting for it to get better but it actually got worse as it went along. Poor acting, poor characters and don't get me started on the ghosts. The art department should be especially proud for incorporating a ghost-like Darth Maul into the film!

301,Polonius85,A Scary Version of Poltergeist,7,11 July 2012,"Yikes! I haven't seen a movie in awhile that both jolted me multiple times AND creeped me out for a long time, simply with it's worldview! (The worldview being that pretty much everyone goes to a dark, creepy hell after death and there is no God). Also, the scares do not let up from the opening title screen to the end of the credits. Plus, the soundtrack, including the use of Tiny Tim's annoying but innocent sounding ""Tiptoe Through the Tulips"", shot my blood pressure up for most of the film.Quick summery: Josh and Renai find their son, Dalton, in an unexplainable coma. Immediately after this, the hauntings begin, and become increasing violent, evil, and horrifying. They hire a medium who tells that that Dalton is not in a coma, but has had an astral projection (out-of-body experience) and his spirit has wandered too far from his body and is lost in the netherworld (or ""The Further"" as it's called in the film). As such, Dalton's body is unoccupied but alive, tempting spirits and demons to possess him in order to enter the world of the living; some to simply live again, and some to wreck havoc. Josh is told that he also possesses the ability for astral projection and thus, he must be the one to enter the netherworld to find Dalton.I agree that there are two ""halves"" to the film, but I strongly disagree that the second half killed the first. The first half is a typical haunting film (slamming doors, strange figures moving around at night, malevolent spirits, etc). The second half goes beyond strange phenomena and has Josh actually go to the other side to get Dalton. This sounds a lot like Poltergeist, but The Further is not a bright light filled with creepy clown dolls and giant skulls. No, this a completed dark parallel universe filled with creepy corpses in suspended animation...until they are disturbed by the living and attack. There is also a demon that I think is the weak point of the film: The face looks like Darth Maul (like spitting image...look it up), but he has a long forked tongue like Venom from Spiderman, and a body like the Hell Knight from Doom and Doom II (look it up). Not that scary. But the lack of lighting and music are creepy enough that it makes up for Darth Maul/Venom.All in all, a very scary movie that I probably won't watch again...it makes you jumpy and uncomfortable from beginning to end. If you need a good fright night movie, this a good choice.",Insidious
302,sumana-m21,"Not scary, funny at times, lame storyline",6,22 May 2011,"5.5/10Darn, this movie was not scary. I read into all the good reviews here and was biting my nails as the movie began. I was so tensed and stressed out even before it began. I watch horror movies all the time. With regards to this movie, if you are 8 years old you will be scared no doubt, but not for adults. And I even saw a bunch of 8 yr olds walk into the theater and then I knew something wasn't right. It was more like taking your kids to the carnival to see some scary looking clowns. My husband and I were bored half way through, we just wanted it to be over. The script started out pretty well but the writer went overboard.

There's got to be a decent scientific explanation to everything, you can't just close your eyes and vanish into the 'Further'.",Insidious
303,crdnlsyn13,I was told this was the scariest movie of 2010,1,19 October 2011,".... Watch Poltergeist instead, it's basically the same movie, but done MUCH better... haunted child? check. old woman psychic? check. paranormal investigators? check. going to the other side to bring the child back? check. Terrible movie, terrible story telling, terrible execution... If they would've called this a poltergeist remake, I wouldn't have wasted my time in watching this. It also seems that they spent a good portion of the budget in hiring some recognizable actors, but in doing so, they completely dropped the ball in EVERY other aspect, although it was good to see Darth Maul get some work. sorry, that's my opinion........ xZx",Insidious
304,JasonXIX,An Insidious Reboot,4,14 September 2019,"Basically a reboot (or ripoff) of Poltergeist, The Exorcist, The Entity, The Sentinel ect. Barbara Hershey even has a part in this movie, just so the Director can acknowledge how much he is ripping off The Entity. Overall, a simple plot with plenty of jump scares and loud noises to add excitement to an otherwise lazy, by the book horror film.",Insidious
305,jasonbourneagain,Great satire.,7,20 November 2011,"I started LMAO when the old lady spirtualist mentioned astral projection. It's a great way for people who do not have a life to live. I was thinking this was a great creepy 'B' movie before that and could accept the two Ghostbusters, but I started laughing so hard my sides hurt when the old lady put on the gas mask with the long nozzle. My Bloody Valentine? It was great comic relief. Then we had that awesome seance scene which led to the raw meat on Whannell and Dalton battling Darth Insidious of Star Wars. There was even the two girls from The Shining tossed in and the ghost family looked like The Night of the Living Dead. Was that Linda Blair as the old bride? I finally got the joke. There probably were some other references that I missed like Freddy's glove and Jason Voorhees' hockey mask. This movie was absolutely hilarious. It was an enjoyable thrill ride of a movie because of the satire.",Insidious
306,neil-shrubb,Hmmm,4,25 April 2021,"Boring & annoying in equal measure, even the desaturated colour annoys me. James Wan shouldn't be allowed to direct traffic let alone Lin Shaye.

307,Nibbler007,"Finally, a true horror film. Hard to be surpassed...",9,24 June 2011,"Hats off to James Wan, I loved Insidious!!! And most of the merit goes to him. The story happens like many other Poltergeist-Paranormal Activity-ish films, but even with this simple argument (boy, we have a haunted house and it's a pain in the ass), we are tested in every scene. Our capacity to scare is tested with original tricks. I didn't notice, but there was not a single drop of blood in the whole film. Even with some borrowed tricks, it scared the hell out of me. The acting was so good, not a flaw, not a single overacting, but an adjusted performance of everyone involved. It also has a strange sense of humor in some parts of the movie, which I liked, similar to the Wes Craven's auto-parodies. Some of the scary parts are to collect and retain in our memories. I must repeat, without spoilers, that IT SCARED THE HELL OUT OF ME. That's what classics do. There are some cinematographic deliverances that made me enjoy extatically the mastership of Wan when it comes to film. But he didn't relie on his talents, he used his talents (like Kubrick's The Shining) to deliver a classic horror film. I'm not comparing Wan with Kubrick, but some of the camera works, some of the angles, are truly brilliant, rarely seen in a horror film. This is a movie you can analyze in many levels... I watched it again and again. I almost never watch a horror film more than once, since is very rare to find a gem like this in the genre and normally I pass the movies with the strange feeling of ""oh my god, this is the same movie I saw last week!"" and I grew tired of horror films recently. But with Insidious, I didn't want it to finish. For me, having seen Poltergeist, I think that (Spielberg apart), Insidious is a masterpiece of horror in a similar level than Poltergeist, or even The Shining (cinematographically speaking). The next horror films, might be a little boring. If there were the Oscars for horror genre, James Wan would get all of them this year. He has stablished a mark with this film, and will be hard to be surpassed.Absolutely recommended. 9/10",Insidious
308,hoju_31,Ugh...,1,28 August 2011,"Why does Hollywood have no concept of money or common sense? This family lives in a $500K - $1 Million house, depending on where the story is supposed to take place, they have three kids, one of whom requires constant medical care and the wife doesn't work. The wife claims she needs to move because the place is haunted. So, does the husband, who hasn't seen anything to indicate ghosts in the house, maybe question his wife's sanity as the most plausible explanation? Of course not! Instead, he does the following: ""Well, sure honey, any reasonable person would think you're insane, we have thousands of dollars of medical bills to pay per month for our comatose son, and I'm a freaking teacher, so yeah, OF COURSE we can just up and leave this house and move into another mansion. It's only money, baby!"". Despite all that, this movie is just your average, cliché-ridden mess full of *gasp* jump scares which are the laziest horror staples money can buy.",Insidious
309,zach-tiefling,Mediocrious,4,25 July 2013,"I can not understand why so many people give this movie high ratings. In the end, it is bland and utterly predicable, so much so, that I was able to call end around the middle of the movie. Insidious tries nothing new or special, nearly every plot-point seems to be recycled from another horror-movie. The only 'tension' in this movie derives from jump-scares. Even the design of the 'ghosts' are 'slightly creepy' at best; The main antagonist, however, looks like guy in a very elaborate halloween costume. Although no movie is required to reinvent the wheel, Insidious doesn't juggle its generic plot, production design, special effects and direction good enough to make for a enjoyable movie. Insidious was filmed on a budget of 1.5 million dollar and (ironically) I guess that - in this case - throwing more money at the production would have benefited the movie a lot. Especially the sets and visuals in the final act seemed to be toned down to the bare minimum they had to be, to make the conclusion of the movie work. Because of that, the end feels rather anticlimactic, instead like a pay-off for a long and slow build-up. This movie will fade away in your mind rather quickly, becoming one with the memory-mush of all the other mediocre movies you know you have seen, but struggle to remember them.",Insidious
310,revelinchaos,INSIDIOUSly crappy,5,29 October 2011,"I read several comments posted here, of grown up men with wife and kids who went on and on about how scary this movie was and how it almost made them pi-, I mean, wet their pants or scream like little girls. So, long story short, I was eager to watch this one, especially because a movie with this budget that succeeds where so many million-dollar-blockbusters fail would have been epic and praiseworthy as a feat in itself.The movie is not so bad for the first half or so, during which it behaves like an ""average"" psychological-horror, that is to say, a movie that works solely on atmosphere coupled with a good photography, music and sound effects to create a sense of tension and/or fear; and it does that relatively well, despite being rather slow paced, uneventful and based on a weak plot. So, to wrap it up: no gore, no special effects, and I'd say, no plot twists.So far it would have been a decent movie (like, 6/10) with some scares (very few) but also pretty boring overall. Fact is that the second part of the movie is actually quite lame, starting from the unnecessary ""comic relief"" of the nerdy ""paranormal investigators"" and continuing with the ridiculous ""monsters""/spirits, the related paranormal mumbo-jumbo (this time involuntarily comic, I guess) and the laughable ""quest"" to save the possessed child.The general acting level left me very unimpressed, and I think that plot, pace, visual effects and ending also leave much to be desired.However, I keep seeing a lot of 1/10 or 9-10/10 flying around these days on here, which I believe to be extremely unbalanced and almost always undeserved. My rating for this movie is 5/10: surely more than watchable (if you like this kind of ""soft horror"", that is), but surely not worthy of all the hype surrounding it, and thus deceiving, or better, insidiously crappy.",Insidious
311,Nixonbrian42,This film was one that I honestly thought was going to be genuine...,2,3 August 2012,"I am a fan of all types of movies, especially very good ones. When I decided to check this one out I read quite a lot of reviews on this site about it beforehand and the majority was how frightening it was. Everybody not only said it was good but that it was the scariest film they had ever seen. To be fair the poster artwork is pristine, whoever was responsible for the poster definitely did a brilliant job. The boy standing in front of the house with the red shirt and demonic eyes looks amazing.I put the movie in, started playing it, and seriously prepared myself.I am not going to dump on anyone else's review. This will be straight forward. The small portable intercom that conveniently picks up audio from another area has been done before people: instead of aliens it's a demon (Signs).The woman being a piano player in general has been done before also: instead of a haunted house it's a haunted boy (The Orphanage).And, oh yes, oh yes...the premise of a child being abducted by evil spirits that ultimately encompasses one of the parents having to cross the boundaries into the other world to rescue them, in case you forgot or are not aware, was already thoroughly covered in a spectacular 1982 Steven Spielberg film called Poltergeist: instead of a little girl it's a little boy. They even managed to steal the idea of the outside help who enter and examine their spooky home. Two men and one woman. Exactly the same scenario. Except that in Poltergeist the three characters delivered intelligent lines and dynamite performances; in Insidious their lines are incredibly flat and their acting, particularly the two guys, could rival any performance from a Japanese Godzilla film.Now aside from the fact that this movie rips off from everything in sight, I'll focus on the level of the scare meter. The scares are equal to a fairgrounds haunted house. They involve a character dressed in very cheap makeup to go RRRAAARRR!!! right after the Director yells action; and then of course adding in post production a loud piece of music. That's silly filmmaking.I have never said the following words in my whole life, but I mean this.........the poster art is misleading. It's so misleading in fact that the poster is more interesting to look at than watching this entire film.I only mentioned a few films that this silly movie steals from but there is actually more.If the storyline had some originality to it and the whole project was more respectfully constructed this could have been a memorable trip.Every OTHER movie I mention here I highly recommend. Signs, The Orphanage, Poltergeist and of course The Exorcist are all excellent. Insidious is cartoon scares and dull thrills.The following is a MASSIVE spoiler: The little boy. Even though you're expecting him to frighten the living hell out of you...he does absolutely nothing?! Reagan in The Exorcist lives up to all the hype, watch that instead.I also want to say one more thing, if you open the ""trivia"" page on this site you'll see that the writer stated at a film festival that he wanted to avoid any movie clichés. I personally found that information to be shockingly hilarious. If you haven't seen this movie yet, check out the trivia first...then check the film out. If you're a regular movie goer who knows a ripoff when you see one then the trivia will have you rolling on the floor in laughter!",Insidious

So I look at it like this. If it freaks you out a few times. Even if the movie is bad and the ending is terrible. It's still worth it.That being said. Man o man is this movie above all else. It's not blood, gore or CGI. It just works on so many levels. The music and sound add so much to this well filmed and acted Horror movie. What a treat it was to watch this film.The whole team that worked on this picture should be given an Oscar when it comes to making horror movies. Its subtle things can do so much.I'm sick of movies that call themselves horror.Freddy From Nightmare On Elm Street never kept me from falling asleep. I was afraid to go swimming anywhere after Jaws. And the Exorcist... that's just scary as... well... hell.INSIDIOUS belongs with these films and many other CLASSIC horror Movies. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.

313,symonm,Scary at first but then turns into a remake of Poltergeist,6,30 April 2012,"Insidious is a strange movie. I can't remember being initially so unsettled by a horror movie for a long time (maybe White Noise all those years ago, the first viewing of Paranormal Activity perhaps) but it soon descends into a rip-off of more than one ""classic"" horror and ends up being almost a word for word re-write of Poltergeist. The eerie moving furniture, the parent having to enter the netherworld to retrieve the child, the ageing female medium that can see the dead and her two buffoon like cohorts that walk around with their Ghostbuster wands. ""Walk to my voice"", ""Only you can save him"" and so on. At the end, if skeletons had risen from an underground graveyard I'd have laughed out loud, but thankfully there was some saving grace in the ending. Even there though, it's well enough done but it's not a shock. In fact I'd suggest that anyone who didn't see it coming, is at best, very new to Horror.So why the 6 rating? Because it's a product of it's time. It's not original, in fact it's so unoriginal with regard to one particular film that it will be viewed as almost a joke movie to some, but as a standalone scary film (and especially if you're young or new to Horror) it's quite creepy at first and a reasonable stab at the genre. I do wish it had lived up to it's start, not been so predictable and not been so overtly a remake of Poltergeist but I guess it's hard to be truly original in Horror nowadays.",Insidious
314,good-decision,"Suspenseful, yes! Scary? Mootpoint",7,30 May 2011,"First of all, I am 38. So, maybe age is a factor. I had nothing to do this evening so I decided to go watch Insidious. I liked the reviews i saw on here that spoke highly of it, and all in all i was not disappointed. The movie will keep you on the edge of your seat. However, I did not find it thaaat scary. What I found real scary was the lady behind me who screamed at the top of her lungs every time a door was slammed open or slammed shut. I would rather say you will be startled a lot during the movie, startled rather than ""scared"". In the first half of the movie, what you may find scary is the fear you see and hear everywhere on the actor's faces (And perhaps behind you if that woman finds a seat behind you too). It was during the first half that I was bored with all the slamming doors and gasps leading nowhere. It reminded of the movie Scream Part 1 when Drew Barrymore was being chased outside in the garden and i was thinking ""yada yada they will never kill Drew"" Then she was slain and gone in the first 5 minutes. THAT made the movie. But here on this one, after a 100 slammed doors and screeching windows, I was more exhausted than scared. Then in the second half, what they are afraid of starts to show. The story is a patchwork of so many pieces you have seen from here and there, a minute from the Exorcist, a minute from the Grudge, a minute from Gothica, and indeed a minute from Saw (towards the end when the dad faces his own demons you will see what I mean). the story is nothing amazing and that heck of one single expression on every single actor's face that doesn't change! How the story is told however, is a different matter. This is not the Others, or Sixth Sense. But it is a good movie on the whole. Would I watch it again or buy the DVD? No.",Insidious
315,austinkunkle,The first in a long time scary movie to actually make me jump,10,21 November 2016,"Of course when you watch a horror movie that contains sequels,you know that the original is never going to change as the scariest original masterpiece ever. When I saw the trailer,I was amazed,but not really scared. When I saw the movie,I was amazed and scared. Quite ironic,right? Well,it surprised me quite a lot. Compared to the sequels,which were really good,but the original will always remain as the best horror movie of 2011. There were quite a few good horror movies I have seen throughout this year,but Insidious was the one that terrified me the most. After I saw this movie,I was doing research on the director James Wan,and I saw he was a horror director,which amazed me due to how many movies I know and loved of his movies. The movies I know he made was Saw, Dead silence,and a few other movies made in the future that I also loved. So James Wan is considered to be the next Wes Craven,and he is just my idol. James Wan really knows when not to mess around with horror films,and I am deeply honored by his line of work",Insidious
316,Raydio,Less than stellar,7,30 June 2011,"I am a big fan of horror films, and have seen many over the years. I had heard good things about Insidious before sitting down to watch it, so I did have slightly high expectations going in. I must admit, the first half of the film was reasonably effective and did a good job of setting the scene for some decent scares. Yes, elements of the story have mostly been seen before, but I was still enjoying the movie. Unfortunately the story started to get rather silly during the second half, and the whole ""astral travel"" thing left me a little disappointed. However the worst feature of this film for me were the ghosts themselves - they just weren't that scary. I mean from the Darth Maul look- alike to the ugly bride with a seriously bad makeup job, I was not so much scared as I was amused. I almost laughed out loud. Not good. For a film that held such initial promise, I was left shaking my head when the credits finally rolled. Not the worst horror film by a long stretch, but it could (and should) have been so much better. If you are after an effective scary film may I suggest any of the following; The Exorcist, The Grudge, The Changeling (George C Scott), The Others or The Descent. 7/10",Insidious

I want to see a storyline, I wanted to be driven into a nightmare and scared, but I am not willing to forget what makes a film good for a few excited(?) jumps.I wanted to like this dud I am reviewing, I did. I went with a good friend, it was a premiere at Lincoln Center in Manhattan, the director, writer and actor were there, it was sweet and personal, but the movie is just BLAH...Didn't like it- it felt laborious, theatrical and cliché-ridden. The directing was choppy- the director never found the right groove it seems and he was trying so damn hard I could hear it. It dragged and it went on endlessly. If it weren't for the loud bouts of sound effects I would not have found a rhythm at all. The acting was unconvincing and listless (ok Rose Byrne had moments of clarity), including the two (extra) heavy handed comic relief atrocities that popped up for no apparent reason than a technical need for a diversion to liven up the sea of dull. I didn't care for a single character, I pretty much wished them dead and over with. Not good. The storyline was way predictable- part Paranormal Activity, part Amityville, part Poltergeist, and not in a good way- ugh- just DULL...

There an overabundance of jump scares, but most of them work incredibly well and the filmmakers' vision of the astral plane is like something out of a childhood nightmare.",Insidious

320,Alenbalz,In side the next dimesion,4,20 January 2016,"A Rather clichéd and predictable below B grade horror movie. But I wouldn't really call it a horror movie. Some kid gets lost in a spirit dimension after astral traveling (out of body experience) Which we discover about 2/3 of the way into the movie,Of course, how or why would an innocent kid ends up in a demon infested 'other dimension' is not really clear. But then it's a horror movie right! So there's no way he'd end up in some happy fantasy land, full of lollies, ice cream and cakes. So the tired old theme of demons possessing the young and innocent Though in this movie, the kid isn't really possessed, just that his soul has wondered too far from his physical body and the panic that if he doesn't return soon, his physical body will be taken over by a demon, So where are all the angels, and why don't they ever take over a kids' body Such is the cliché of horror movies.A demon-mortal combat, where a mere mortal often outwits and beats the devil, Unless of course the producers plan on a sequel Then the demon wins, or survives to fight another day (i.e. act in another movie). And yes there's two sequels of this mediocre movie. Having said all that, there's worse out there, but I wouldn't rate this much above 4, 0nce again I got sucked in by the IMDb rating above 6.

I felt this movie was genuine, the decisions seemed realistic, the scares were real scares. When you watch a horror movie and you want to really watch it for the genre, you probably do something like what I do, switch off the lights in the room, put on the earphones or the speakers and watch it somewhat close to the screen.

323,utslitt,"I Don't Get All These ""Scariest Movie Ever"" Reviews",3,14 July 2019,"After watching the movie, I wasn't impressed. I figured I'd get on here and see what other reviewers had to say that might change my mind a little, as well as what some interesting facts were that could maybe influence my negative opinion to a possibly less negative (or even forgiving) one. I didn't want to just type my first impression having not really thought about it all too much for it to be nothing more than a negative, unhelpful rant of garbage.Unfortunately, nothing changed my opinion. Everything reinforced it.I'm a huge fan of Patrick Wilson, but this movie is by far not one of his best examples of his acting talents. He looked just as bored as everyone else on screen. The movie drags on as monotonous as it possibly can while providing many overly obvious jump scares.What bugged me the most was how some of the imagery in this movie had the potential to be so much more impactful if it had been treated a little better. The only thing that will stick with you after this film is Tiny Tim's ""Tiptoe Through the Tulips"" and even then I don't know how grateful you'd be for that because it's truly obnoxious. There's clearly a reason why there's so many memes out there of this movie. Not because it's ""so scary"", or genuinely demented, but because it's a joke. Instead of being tuned in for the scare of a lifetime, viewers will spend their time amazed at how they've all of the sudden became a psychic due to newfound abilities to know what's going to happen in the movie ages before it happens.When it comes to the ending of the movie, it was so lazily done. It feels more like a glorified Worldstar video that should be on reddit than it does a tension packed, twist ending. It had me in disbelief that James Wan directed this. The same James Wan that would go on to handle The Conjuring so well, and had brought us Saw, had made this colorless, lifeless garbage that was on my television right now. How disappointing.If you haven't seen this movie, don't bother. It's nothing more than an overhyped laughing stock that tries and fails to be the Poltergeist of its time. Even then, if you still insist, grab some friends and some beers and get ready to indulge each other in some MST3K style banter as one cannot hesitate to poke fun at the garbage fire that is this movie. If you have a hard time finding it to watch, check the $5 bin at Walmart. I'm sure it'll be there.",Insidious

It had been a while since I saw a decent scary movie so I was looking forward to it. I went into it expecting some scares but nothing too bad. Wrong. This movie scared me out of my wits. I don't think I have ever jumped more during any other scary movie. The audience was spooked too. I saw many other people jumping out of their seats and even heard a few actual screams.What I loved about this movie was that it actually tries to scare you, not gross you out. The images are frightening for sure. Insidious doesn't waste any time trying to creep you out. The scares already start with the opening credits. I sure was not expecting this to be one of the scariest movies i've seen but it lives up to that. That being said, I don't think I'd have the guts to see it again!",Insidious

I had to go through 5 pages of reviews on this site to finally find some people who also were unimpressed with this film.I'm not even bothering to go into the whole plot. It reminded me of ""Poltergeist"", but no where near as thrilling and suspenseful. No. Where. Near. The buildup was so damned slow and the plot wasn't very good either. It was a totally average kind of horror movie. Maybe not even average. I thought it was kind of stupid. People were laughing in the audience. Not good when it's not a funny scene on the screen. It wasn't scary or suspenseful. I don't understand how people can call this movie frightening and unsettling. It's totally not either. Of course, I didn't think Paranormal Activity was scary, suspenseful or very good.I guess, if you liked Paranormal Activity...have at it and watch this.

The movie is made by the guy who created the Saw series, James Wan, and I liked the first one but the rest were dumb to me. I was eager to view this, and I wasn't disappointed but I feel the hype was undeserved with some calling this a horror masterpiece and all.The movie starts with a family moving into a house and the young son of the family falls victim to demonic forces and lays in a coma as a result that nobody can explain. Strange things start happening and eventually the parents call in paranormal investigators who explain to them the son is in a dimension called ""the further"" which his son is lost in and only the father can rescue him as he had experiences as a child.This movie I felt would have horror clichés, and I feel it was wearing movies like Poltergeist and The Exorcist on its sleeves.But the movie does have a few good genuine scares, and it does manage to build suspense, but I felt the demonic figure in this movie looked a little fake, and the last forty minutes of the movie was predictable and not as good as the opening half.But by all means it's an above average horror movie and audiences will get what they're expecting.",Insidious
328,MoffatLP,One of the Scariest Movies I Have Ever Seen,7,13 April 2011,"Without a doubt, this is the scariest movie I have ever seen. It isn't a movie that only makes stuff jump at you, 'Insidious' combines sudden creatures jumping out at you with disturbing, creepy figures you can't even bare to look at. I personally can't remember the last horror movie that actually mad me scared, but this I will say is the first to succeed. Plot is very good, when a kid goes into a coma and his soul gets trapped in another world where demons roam, and attempt to possess his body in order to escape to the real world to live again. It may not seem scary, but trust me, it was really, really horrifying. The way they looked, with their weird smiles and close up images of them make you jump and scream.It was clear that 70's and 80's horror films inspired this movie. With high pitched violins to build up the scene where something really creepy happens. Some scenes were so scary I had to cover an eye. It was the way the creatures looked that did most of the scares. Some of the predictable scenes scared you because you knew something was going to happen, but didn't know what it was. A movie with high pitched violins, really loud noises, and lots of screams is a descent way to define it. The movie starts off kind of slow, but progressively gets better and better as it goes on. There are a few shaky camera angles and some dark shots that tried to make it feel scary, but you can't seen anything. In the shots like this, they only last for a few seconds before changing to give you a better view of the scene.Yeah it gets kind of stupid near the end and Darth Maul was in it (why, again?), but it was rather enjoyable. However, there isn't much to go back to and I don't have any desire to see it again. But for a single viewing, Insidious was well worth the watch.Insidious gets a 7/10.",Insidious
329,art-miller,Nonsense. Dated. Lazy. Clichéd.,1,4 June 2015,"OK. If you are aged over twelve obviously you won't be reading this review as this is a children's film...so this review is directed at the kids.Wow, children...you are going to love this. It begins with some clichéd bog-standard off-the-shelf stock horror movie music which sets the scene. Then we have the actual title appear in scary Hammer Horror style (sorry, you are too young to understand that reference.)The hammy block-of-wood performances from all involved will not bother you as you will not have yet understood what real acting looks like. And the so-called storyline won't trouble you either as it moves along predictably like one of your Enid Blyton books.Look out for some well-signposted scary bits. You will know well in advance as the music will get really tense with lots of screechy violins. Get ready for a loud bit when the director hits you with something sort of dark; it might make you jump so hold on tight to your mum's hand. She might be asleep at this point so wake her up and tell her something happened.About two thirds of the way through it will go into an amusing final third where everything is what we call spooky and blurry with a man wandering about in a mystical place called 'Further'. He has a torch which in true horror film style he shines mostly in his own face. This might be the time to ask your mum if you can have an ice cream. When I foolishly watched this film this is the point I left the cinema for refreshment....and never came back.Just be sure to tell your mum if you intend to do the same. Stick to Disney, kid. Probably scarier than this.",Insidious

331,josephjanz,33 violins,7,28 September 2021,"Mood music, ambiance, and jump scares. If that is what scares you then you must see Insidious. They used 33 violins to create the mood music and ambiance for this thriller. The cast of this film is outstanding. Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne make very believable parents and I was thrilled to see Barbara Hershey back in the horror game as well. Lin Shaye is planting a firm foothold in her place in horror history as well. This film is the best evolution of haunted house films because it goes beyond the physical confines of the house. Can't wait to see the rest of these films.",Insidious
332,jlt86,Definitely the Best Scary Movie in a LOOOOOONG Time...,7,20 April 2011,"Insidious is by FAR the best scary movie to come out in what feels like a very VERY long time. It wasn't just a ""good"" scary movie, but a genuinely ""scary"" scary movie. From the opening shot to the credits, everything just seemed to work. There were no big special effects and there was no cheesy CGI which in my opinion, really brings down the quality of supernatural movies. The scares were genuine and a few parts really had the whole audience gasping and jumping out of their seats. I myself had chills...which hasn't happened with any scary movie in the past 8 years. Granted, it's not a perfect movie, and there are some of the usual scary movie clichés, but in no way do they rob the movie of being enjoyable. Overall, Insidious is creepy and very scary and most importantly, a FUN movie to watch. It gives you the scare you want and the enjoyment you want from walking through a Haunted House during Halloween time. After watching this movie, horror directors and writers should takes notes and tips from James Wan and Leigh Whannel.",Insidious
333,The_creator2010,A horror/Chiller that is worth the praise!,10,17 June 2012,"Insidious is a classic piece of work released in 2010. It follows the Horror slash chiller path, representing a genre that has failed cinemas for the past 10 years . Certain Horror movies have made a significant mark in cinema history, dating back as far as ""It""(1990), Halloween (1978), ""Friday the 13th (1980) and ""A Nightmare on elm street""(1984). Those few of many classics are fine examples of the word, ""Horror"" as they were successful in frightening the audience, leaving visual implants into the brain of the average viewer. If you are still thinking of a movie that scared you mentally and physically before you go to bed at night? that movie had done it's job. If you find yourself watching it for the next 20 years or so, it is indeed a classic. Similar to my examples above. Another example, Insidious.Dalton Lambert (Ty Simpkins) falls suddenly into a catastrophic coma following an accident in the family's abandoned attic. The parents, Josh and Renai are bewildered to the result that follows as Dalton is hospitalized before being transferred home to be treated further more.The Coma appears far from basic as several months on reveal Dalton is no closer to being revived. It is when spiritual happenings occur through-out the house that Renai (Rose Byrne) begins to question the possible relation to the apparent haunting and her son, Dalton.Josh (Patrick Wilson) is your typical male, ideal father. Although he is paranoid for the safety of his son, he does not believe in Paranormal activity. The films disturbing plot is seen through the eyes of Renai and Josh as we watch their creepy situations come to life. As Dalton lies lifeless in his bed, both parents are caught up in haunting visions and disturbing sounds as whatever it is stalking the family home, it appears to be coming from Dalton's room.In a desperate bid to seek and rid the house of the evil spirits, Renai invites paranormal doctor Elise (Lin Shaye) in a last ditch attempt to convince herself that she is not going insane. The Inclusion of Lin Shaye proved a touch of class as the result of her inclusion is highly memorable, offering a more darker feel than her character ""Elise"" had intended.A haunting tale with a slight twist, Insidious looks and feels awesome. The movie is shot with a dull shade of grey, giving off a depressing feel to what seems ever so real. There are some jumpy scenes that will guarantee the awakening of the average viewer.A great introduction with a snip of relation to the vintage Hammer production, with a frightening violin tune that the mind will struggle to erase once the movie comes to a climax. Without saying too much about such a clever and tense concept, it is a plot that should be truly revealed in a dark room, by yourself! Taking into account what we have seen over the years, Insidious finishes top with one of the best horror movies of the past ten years. The last movie released that blends into this category is ""Drag Me to Hell"" by Sam Raimi. Also a must see for all horror fans.Insidious did all the right things for me. It had me shook in a disturbing way, a way that makes me want to witness its crafty work over and over again.Did you enjoy my review? check out my previous and up to date reviews at my blog - http://gerrysreviewsforthosecurious.blogspot.com/",Insidious

Arts & Crafts is the new Victorian haunted house that can bee seen everywhere after this film (American Horror Story, Lights Out etc...)

343,awvknj,Scary but cinematic effects got lost in the dark,7,30 September 2021,"Although I managed to enjoy this film I kept thinking to myself as I watched it - I'm really tired of how this genre wants to film what seems to be a majority of scenes in the dark. It's not enjoyable and hard on the eyes. There needs to be a better balance between setting scene as being ""in the dark"" mode but then actually being able to see the special scary stuff. I watched it streaming and I kept backing it up to understand what I was supposed to be seeing and what I was missing. When I wasn't feeling frustrated by all of the scenes filmed in the dark it gives a few good scares and twist at the end but now I suppose that means sequels ad infinitum and I doubt they'll be any better than this one.

The story has an interesting storyline that is a bit recycled but the direction, details and flow of this movie give you something that has been missing for these types of movies which is the shock factor. So much shock factor and it is so well done. I thought the shock factor in these ghost/else-realms was gone with the 80s but here we see all that goodness back and very much welcomed. It is hard to pull off the shock factor in a non slasher movie but they do it here. Now when I saw the storyline is a bit recycled don't let that fool you. I'm talking in a general sense because you'll watch it and see that the story is original but it does barrow elements but what movie doesn't nowadays? Don't get me wrong, it is a great horror movie and I'm surprised Hollywood still remembers how to make them.SEE THIS NOW.. with the lights off",Insidious

The one good thing about this movie is the rather ingenious wordplay inside the title itself. On the other hand, I'm not sure of this director and above all, this screenwriter, warrants any form of praise. If you like your food premasticated, then enjoy this rehash by all means; it looks like the writer or director has plundered the kitchen of the Friday the 13th franchise, The Shining, and above all the Poltergeist family saga.

349,davebest2001,Another over-hyped non-scary horror,4,16 May 2011,"I could tell from the opening credits that James Wan was copying the style of 'The Evil Dead' here. In certain places he also seemed to be copying Kubrick's eerie style as used in 'The Shining'. I saw one scene reminiscent of the climax to Nick Roeg's 'Don't Look Now'. The first half of the film was pretty good. It built up nicely as the threats to the family increased. The baby monitor with the threatening noises on it was one of the few frightening scenes. The intruder in the bedroom was just daft, as was the dwarf running around the house. The demon character was like a Mexican wrestler or Darth Maul from Star Wars. The bit where the dad goes into The Further and back into the house was plain daft. The ending was poor as well. Overall the material was there to deliver a really good horror. However, it just came across as confused. I don't think that it's a good sign when horror films are PG-13. Takes a very skilled director to create scares within those confines.",Insidious
350,EvilBaldDude,Good traditional horror film,8,27 December 2011,"A lot of people get horror DVDs expecting to see blood, and gore and internal organs all around the place.Insidious isn't like that. It basically just uses more traditional methods like good directing, good editing and good acting to scare the life out of you.There are elements of it that are reminiscent of the 80s film Poltergeist. But unlike that piece, it won't try to dazzle you with special effects either.I guess they realise that fear of the unknown is a much more effective motif than anything they can visualise with cgi.",Insidious

The Conjuring was one of the best movies I've seen, so I thought I'd watch James Wan's earlier movies. I had heard about Insidious a very long time ago, but I never thought I should watch it, until recently. I was very surprised by how good Insidious was. I was expecting a creepy-ish movie revolving around in-house hauntings, but it was much more than that. Insidious had an amazing plot, and was also much more frightening then I expected. The movie revolves around the idea of astral-projection, an out-of-body experience that makes you feel like your physical conscience is disconnected from your body. (Some real mountaineers who hike through low-gravity zones describe this.) The movie displays a boy who can do this at will while sleeping. Although something about this ability ends up bringing a lot of fright to him and his family. I found the movie very exciting and suspenseful, while also being interesting & enjoyable. There were a few jump-scares that made me jump, and the movie as a whole was quite scary. There were some extremely creepy moments that I still vividly remember. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes horror movies. My final rating is 9/10.",Insidious

The only negative about this movie is that it also fits well into the low budget trendy new horror movie genre as well. If you don't focus too much on the acting per say (which isn't all bad) you can see how this movie has a good build and plot that succeeds away from the cliché. Even though I thought the closing scenes were a bit cheesy it still is a good overall movie. Yet, considering i haven't seen chapter 2, i cant whole-heartedly fully validate this movie. 7 out of 10 rent it in succession if you're bored.",Insidious

355,james_tabang,"Scary at some scenes, but not too much.",7,15 February 2015,"I had watched James Wan's The Conjuring before this, so I had high expectations. I am a fan of found footage horror films, but the Conjuring was one of my favorite commercial horror films. The start of Insidious is always good, like in Annabelle, which he also had directed. James knows how to create a very uneasy atmosphere. Insidious was a scary one, but as usual, at the middle towards the end, it gets fast=paced, knowing that the mysteries are being divulged. Plus, the repeated overusing of loud distorted scary orchestra sounds can sometimes be annoying, like it is trying too hard to scare. Near the end of the film, it doesn't get scary, especially since the demon's face is explicitly shown. It looks more like watching an adventure/fantasy film. Overall, I enjoyed this better than Annabelle, but this film is short of scenes that would have made it more well-remembered.",Insidious
356,Bolly_Boba_Booboo,violent cult masterpiece,2,25 November 2011,"Truly awful! Incoherent story line, grainy unimaginative cinematoraphy, thunerstorm loop for a sound track, extremely poor acting - in general no redeeming reasons to torture yourself by viewing. That is unless you're into guys in their underwear writhing in bed while rubbing their chests (?) The blooper reel, however, was half interesting since it showed how awful the actors really were. Although the movie is put out by ""Cult Films"", it has no hope of attaining a cult film status. Rent anything else...Much worse than I thought it would be, and that was pretty bad. The only reason I gave it 2 stars was the boys were extra fine, but the script needed much help, it was a disaster. Mr. Wan, you let me down on this one. I am a big supporter, but this one failed miserably. 2 stars, don't waste your time unless you like to see straight boys in their shorts, bad one",Insidious
357,chantalroxanne,Average,6,11 June 2014,"I watched Insidious thinking it would be one of the scariest movies I would ever see. I've read so many good reviews and heard great things about it. But honestly, it's an average horror movie. Not bad at all, but not spectacular either. The story is good and not predictable if you haven't read any spoilers. There are definitely some great jump scares and a few pretty creepy scenes. I think the actors are doing a good job in this film, especially Rose Byrne. But here's the negative thing. The demon that wants to take control over Dalton's body looks like someone dressed up for Halloween. Far from scary. Especially when you see him crawling like some sort of lizard. If they had come up with a really creepy demon instead of this one, the movie would definitely get a 9 star rating from me. But this funny looking creature kind of ruined it. All together, I do think Insidious is a nice movie when you're really into horror. It's not like you will really waste your time. It just could have been better",Insidious
358,algal-64164,A film that does not necessarily work in favor of PG-13 horror movies,4,14 May 2021,"The set-up of Insidious certainly is fascinating: a child, after going into an old attic, falls into a coma. Nobody knows what is happening. Strange things keep happening around the house. Finally, the family, distraught, calls a group of paranormal investigators to investigate the situation.This is where the film gets truly stange, as it shifts from being a standard horror film to being a strange fictional docu-drama/horror combo. James Wan pulls out a few cheap jump scares. However, for the most part, the film stops being interesting because the screenwriter has decided to make the threat too tangible. The sense of hopelessness that pervades the first section of the film seems to vanish as the film falls into trope after trope of scares and creepy imagery. It is not a completely ineffective film, and at times is quite intense, but because the film decides to give everything away at once, it becomes very dull and tedious.A few words of praise: Lin Shaye's performance is outstanding by horror standards and she makes her character by far the most interesting in the film. The film was also completed on a tiny one million dollar budget, which by Hollywood standards would have been unacceptable. James Wan manages to make something out of it.",Insidious

Although it put me in mind of ""Poltergeist"" with the whole having to go to another ""World"" to save someone, or the classic part of Amityville 8 with the final attic scene. This was a very promising storyline, however it tries so hard to be realistic from the off then trails off into fantasy land. *sigh* I really felt for the characters originally, struggling with their young son who suddenly one day after a fall is in a ""coma"" Cue distraught mother and absent, working late, aggro father refusing to believe that the house is haunted after weird things suddenly start to happen.. before finding irrefutable ""evidence"" ( who does not look at their kid's wall and see drawings when trying to find out what has happened to them??? they spend a good deal of time in his bedroom but never spot a MASSIVE clue??) Some scenes genuinely had me freaked.. the shoes and the little boy, Dalton ""walking around"" while in a coma was very eerie. The creepy guy stood by him pointing. The house in the ""further"" with the very odd family. But the main ""demon"" well, not so much. Didn't even look scary- a pierced darth maul- esque face with blue eyes,the classic cloven hooves under furry legs and razor sharp teeth showing hints of a forked tongue.Hmmm, sure. It was at the point where he is filing his claws on a sander surrounded by puppets in some phantom of the opera worthy setting that I felt the movie had lost it's way slightly. Also the whole,creepy psychic woman- who knows more than she lets on.. mother's prophetic/flashback dream and of course, the token over exuberant paranormal investigators made me think ""tired clichés!"" but they did manage to make some scenes more realistic in this attempt at least...So, a few too many clichés and cookie cutter horror scenarios later( the hey I'm a psychic- something's up with your house- you know that cause I pause mid sentence and give ""that look"" but dismiss it.. so..""let's look round here-oh!yep a ghost-Let's break it to the family.

I usually cringe at possession movies but this one has such a good backing behind it with a diffent take on the possession thing. James Wan once again solid directing and earns every scare. I feel like the tension was mediocre some ports near the end were good.

364,krenwregget,Doesn't live up to its potential.,5,31 July 2014,"This film falls under what I like to call ""commercial horror"", that being produced by a large, Hollywood studio for as wide an audience as possible. In that, I guess it's a success. Where it does not succeed is providing the horror-savvy viewer with anything new or interesting.This film and it's director/writers borrow from other films in the genre (the Sixth Sense, the Shining, the Others, Poltergeist) but any seasoned fan should be able to guess where and when the scares are coming.The first half creates a decent tone but the tired, horror clichés tend to skirt away any real tension and the overuse of sudden, jarring musical/audio cues jolts the viewer more than any of the imagery. It's as if they didn't think the movie itself was doing a well enough job of conveying the frights so they decide to hammer you over the head with loud noise to indicate that THIS PART IS SUPPOSED TO BE SCARY!! GET IT???!!! The cast seem to be more horror stereotypes or caricatures rather than real people we can identify with and even Patrick Wilson, who is usually very solid, gets a little cartoonish towards the end. Things start to come off the rails in the third act as the film struggles to find its identity, especially when it can't decide who is really the villain: rip-off Darth Maul/goat man or the rip-off 'Woman in black'.If you are a horror newbie, you might enjoy this but for the 'smart mark' viewer, you've seen this before and executed better in other films.Is anyone else really tired of unresolved, open endings that allude to an obvious sequel? I know it's about trying to milk the marks for all you can, but I think it leads to lazy writing, and this film is proof.",Insidious
365,Demetrius_Stork,Terrifying and interesting,9,29 November 2015,"Insidious is the kind of film that gives me hope for the horror genre. This film at least lets me know that there is still potential for horror movies to be well made, have original ideas, and most importantly, be scary. One thing I enjoyed about this movie is the score. A really talented group of sound designers worked on this film and it really shows. From the bright, flashy title card, to the music cue set whenever something scary happens. This score has already become classic and several other movies have utilized this same kind of score, leading me to believe that this movie had significant influence on the horror genre.Another thing I really enjoyed about this movie is the quality of scares. This movie really has a good idea of how to set up suspense and payoff. The demon in this film is good too, even though many make fun of his uncanny resemblance to Darth Maul. The way they present him is fantastic. Playing ""tip-toe through the tulips"" along with keeping him in the shadows for the majority, it's all very scary. The rest of the ghosts in this movie are cool too. This movie really isn't afraid to show you what's supposed to scare you, which I give it huge props for. Director James Wan has shown in the past that he knows how to present the scares well and it clearly shows in this flick.The acting in this film is good. Patrick Wilson always does a pretty decent job, and he does so once again as the lead Josh. I'm always a fan of Rose Byrne and she does a great job here, showing her diversity as an actress. I really enjoyed the two nerdy guys too, Specs and Tucker. Their comic relief kind of comes out of nowhere and isn't really necessary but I enjoyed it none the less. The rest of them are O.K. Lin Shaye I find to be a little hokey at times but it's very passable. The child actor is pretty bad, but what can you really expect?The plot of this movie might be it's best aspect however. I love the idea of the further and astral projection is something that isn't touched upon very often in films so that's really cool. The idea of going into a realm, the further, that is filled with troubled spirits is really great and offers some great tension. The last third is where I find the most problems with the film though. The scene where Josh fights the Demon in front of the red door is stupid. The fact that he can defeat this thing just because he's the one alive is just silly. If that's the case then why can the main demon kick our main hero's ass without a problem? The other thing I really didn't like also involves the main demon. It's shown throughout the whole movie that this thing is super powerful. And the further is a plain of reality where this demon can move to wherever his wants, this is demonstrated when the demon seemingly teleports behind Josh in his lair. But this demon, multiple times, let's the kid escape when he could easily catch him. The suspension of disbelief is shattered when the demon tries to grab him under his bed instead of just cornering him. Then the demon who is fast as hell is outran by a kid! It's just silly and it's the reason this movie isn't a 10/10.In conclusion, This movie is awesome, this movie is sure to make you jump and make you turn on a few light after it's over. The scares are good, the music is brilliant, and the movie immerses you in a story you won't want to miss(and the ending is cool). Worth a watch, if you want to get scared.",Insidious

It started to build up quite nicely and then abruptly the movie takes a turn into hacksville, driven by Hamfist and his girl Ms. Boring.Heavy handed introduction of 'comedy', over explanation, in your face 'scares' which insinuate the audience is too stupid to get it on their own, and an other realm which is boring as all get out. Even the supposed super bad guy was laughable because he looks like he was lifted right from another movie. With all they could have done with the theme, and the scare credit they had built up it was such a damned disappointment. The best I can say it was like coffee which had too much sugar in it, the thing that was supposed to accentuate it, was overdone, ruining it.Final Analysis: It did have a few shocks, but they were muted in the end when they let the film go off target.

Acting is great, music fits perfectly and reminds on old school horror and thriller movies (why there aren't more movies that use violin to create scary atmosphere?!). In one word little masterpiece filmed with rather small budged (congratulations Mr. Wan and crew!). In this part of the movie I decided to write the review, just to prolong the time to go to sleep.2. Last 20 minutes or so... In here all went down the drain, atmosphere and tensions that were so carefully built were ruined, or at least I felt like that.

I was expecting it to be scary but not as scary as what it is there are some scenes that will make you jump some scenes that will haunt you forever. The scares start right from the opening credits and it doesn't get easier to watch the pace of the movie is really good as well it never has a dull moment plus the plot is a inventive one that you wont have seen much of. Insidous shows us that horror movies can still be scary not just full of gore. Insidous is one of my top ranking horror movies if you want a really really scary movie this is a must see but don't watch ot without the lights one ill warn you now is one hell of a scary movie.

374,dreamflix,No Night Terrors,4,2 April 2011,"There was a review on Friday from a 13-year-old who saw the movie with his mother. The kid was spot on with his review regarding the music. The music was great for this movie. It reminded me of the old-days Vincent Price movies. The opening credits were attention-getting. After that, the movie fell into sleep-mode. The kid did mention that to him the movie was scary-creepy, but for adults, it might be just scary. I thought I would give it a try, expecting to see a good movie. I would say that if you liked Paranormal Activity I/II and from years back the Blair Witch Project, then you would like this movie. Had I known it was made by the same folks from Paranormal Activity, I would have stayed home and saved my money. The movie is so slow to start. The story line was oh, so predictable. If you watch movies of this genre and have done so for decades, then you can pick up on the story line in a heart beat. The ghouls were not scary. Reading that the movie was made on $800k explains a lot about the cheap look to it. - Just like the Paranormal movies. Why did I bother to even see those movies? I thought the first one was fact-based. My nieces talked me in to seeing the second one. And they were bored. Back to Insidious, I could hear restless movement in the movie theatre. People were bored. Only a few jumped here or there. If you're scared easily, this is the movie for you. If you like something that's fresh, moves at a good clip and keeps your mind active, this isn't the movie for you.",Insidious

Then for months the house is haunted but the idiot father can't see it. They move into the new house, and they see it is the kid not the house.For no reason, two of the people they hire are comedians, not serious actors, the ""computer guys"".

They are mostly with blood and guts spilled all over the place while this one focuses more on ones' psyche which is really rare. I've watched this movie only twice but both times it was creeping me out. Combination of good sound effects and creepy pictures make you unable to sleep afterwords. The ending was so unpredictable and brutal that I was shocked by it. Although I haven't seen the actors before in any movie I can say they did a really good job portraying the characters in the very best way they could. I recommend this movie to everyone.,Insidious
377,justinpkelly,A pretty bland movie with few legitimate scares,6,14 October 2017,"I went into Insidious really excited- I love James Wan and I think both ""Conjuring"" movies are incredibly well-directed thrill rides. Although Insidious is considered to be one of the scariest movies in recent years, unfortunately, I felt that the scares in this movie were really cheap and the characters were too thin.Although ""The Conjuring"" may not have the greatest characters, that movie is so well-directed with such incredible atmosphere and pacing that it was a non-stop thrill ride. The scares were legitimately frightening and were not just loud sound effects. Unfortunately, the scares in ""Insidious"" are more like the latter; they are all accompanied by an ear-splitting noise that honestly annoyed me every time it happened. There were some scenes, like the scene in which the ghost is standing behind the crib early on in the movie, that were ruined by the ridiculously loud piano bang noise. That scene would have been so much creepier if the ghost was shown just standing there in complete silence. Having the loud noise only distracts the viewer from what is really scary about the scene. If the jumpscares were only occasional, I probably would have been able to disregard them. But it got to the point where practically every scary scene involved a loud jolting noise and there were few subtle scenes in between. The creepiest moment in the movie was when Josh's mom showed him the pictures of the old lady demon standing beside him. That was an incredibly scary scene and did not include a headache-inducing bang; the creepy subtly was enough to make the scene work. The characters were also very bland. I would have been able to overlook the cheap nature of the scares if I felt emotionally attached to the story, but I didn't. We were supposed to care about Josh because of his past encounters with that old lady I suppose, but it was set up really poorly. In fact, the beginning of the movie was really weak in general. The characters were first shown in really sloppy fashion and I never really felt hooked like I have in previous James Wan movies.There was a lot of creativity in this movie, though. The third act, in particular, was quite entertaining and the ""ghost dimension"" had a great atmosphere. It separated this movie from typical haunted house films. The designs of the creatures and ghosts were all great, although I must admit the main demon creature looked far too similar to Darth Maul and it is incredibly obvious that James Wan ripped off that design (that's not to say that it isn't scary, though). I also hate the fact that the movie ended in a cliffhanger. We never got any resolution to the film and they might as well have had the words ""Tune in for Part 2!!"" show up on the screen at the end. Despite the creative elements in that third act, to be completely honest, there were too many similarities to Poltergeist and it should have been toned down by a lot. It didn't feel like a loving homage so much as it felt like it was ripping it off.Overall, Insidious is just OK. I was incredibly disappointed with the lack of truly scary scenes in the movie and I hope that James Wan never reverts to the techniques he used here.5.5/10 Grade: C+",Insidious
378,hearthstoneivan,A festival of shiny lights and loud noises.,8,9 April 2018,"7.6/10 A bit of a repetitive bore, until it embraces its delightful goofiness. There is a certain amount of relief, when you find out that the movie is not taking itself too seriously, and it allows wonkyness to work in its favor. Aside from the magnetic Lin Shaye, the enthusiasm of the actors seems to reach only the pointy ends of a dollar bill, which is neither offensive nor surprising.

I didn't get anywhere near, it was described as terrifying I watched it late at night with no one in the house and still forgot about it 2 minutes after. All the scares are telegraphed , the story is a mix between Poltergeist, The Hole and The others and while it was entertaining slightly, I was expecting far far more. So all in all the rating pg 13 was correct and I wouldn't expect anywhere near the movie that has been reviewed.And while this is a lot lot better than the drivel coming out in the last 10 years im afraid the days of classic scary supernatural horror are over with a few exceptions like the ring, Dead Silence and Gravedancers, i give a solid 5 out of 10",Insidious

Oh wait, that's a different old lady, she's just playing the exact same role, I get it. Why does every family in every movie that involves a ""haunting"" insist on keeping as many lights turned off as possible? Is the midst of a Haunting problem really the best time to go green? Did the ghost trip a circuit breaker? Hey, your house may be haunted, your kid may be in danger, but don't bother turning on a light somewhere, naww.... just blunder around in the dark.

382,fireblazer666,"Started out great, fell off short pretty fast though",6,24 December 2011,"I can't give this less than 6, but I can't maintain dignity and give it higher than 6. The movie has a great start, really great actually. It was hauntingly chilling during the first third or so of the movie, but sadly, it began getting unconvincing and unbelievable as the movie progressed. The story just got so preposterous half way through that I had a hard time sitting through it. I found myself rolling my eyes, sighing, saying to myself ""really...? c'mon"".I love movies, horror movies especially, and if this would have maintained the quality and believability of the first third of the movie it would have been a solid 8, maybe even 8.5. For the most part theacting was decent. As usual Rose Byrne acted her role very convincingly. In fact, I only watched this movie because I hold her acting abilities in high regard after watching 4 seasons of Damages, as well as the movie Just Buried (which I watched 3 times).I think when everything is said and done, I almost wished I hadn't watched it. But Rose Byrne was great, it was chilling for a good 40 minutes or so. I won't say how the ending turned out, because that would spoil things, but I'm a fan of non-typical endings, so I was ""ok"" with the ending.I feel bad giving it a 6/10, because Rose Byrne performed so well, but the story just didn't hold up to my expectations as were established at the beginning part of the movie. I'd give Rose a 9/10 easily though, as an actress. Her husband however... I couldn't get over how fake his snores sounded, call me picky, but they just sounded silly... and frankly, it's silly of me even to be bothered by that, yet, oddly... I am.Worth a watch if you like Rose Byrne, but elsewise I can't necessarily recommend it as it felt unbelievable, preposterous, and drawn out, story-wise.",Insidious

However, one night, the eldest child, Dalton, bumps his head after falling off the ladder in the loft and is soon in a coma.

This is the scariest film that I have seen since the 1st Paranormal Activity film. This film grips you from beginning to end as the scenes and the soundtrack set the mood and the atmosphere of the film which is terrifying and negative. The film is also creepy and throughout the film the suspense builds up as you don't know what is going to happen next.And I was the only in the theatre who did a couple of screams.

The movie isn't scary at all! Nor is it original. Its the run of the mill story of the wife being home alone quite a lot and she starts seeing things and of course the husband does not believe her at first until he sees things too so they get some mental woman in to help get rid of the spirits. Its the same rubbish we've seen a million times in the past and I dare say we will see again in the not too distant future.

Anyway the parents seek help from a group of exorcists to help free the boy from possession. This movie has a lot of effective imagery. The demons look really strange, especially when they're out in the real world. The move does go a little over the top with scare chords and hammy acting, but this is probably deliberate. The exorcism scene is the best scene in the whole movie. It is very intense and dark (literally) and memorable.My problem with the movie is the last act, which gets very slow and almost turns into a completely different movie. The atmosphere changes completely and it pretty much becomes a haunted house ride that drags on for a long time. Also, random things happen at times for no reason other than to scare you.

That could have been a good, interesting twist, but it just ended up being silly.When the psychic woman gets the guy to draw pictures for her, it seemed pointless. Why does she need him to do that?? What is the point??? Why does she need him to write down what she says too?? What is with the sandman mask? Why can't she just talk normally??

388,Yellow_under_the_feet,One of the best horror film coming out from 210-2014,5,3 August 2014,"Insidious is a 2010 American supernatural horror film directed by James Wan ( saw , paranormal activity and many more ), and starring Patrick Wilson, Rose Byrne and Barbara Hershey. The story centers on a couple whose son inexplicably enters a comatose state and becomes a vessel for ghosts in an astral dimension. A family looks to prevent evil spirits from trapping their comatose child in a realm called The Further. A sequel, Insidious: Chapter 2, was released on September 13, 2013, with Wan returning as director and Whannell returning as screenwriter. Because of the film's success it was turned into a maze for 2013's annual Halloween Horror Nights. Music- Insidious was composed by Joseph Bishara, who also appears in the film as the demon. Performed with a quartet and a piano, a bulk of the score was improvised and structured in the editing process, although some recording sessions began prior to filming. On describing the approach of the film's soundtrack, director James Wan explained, ""We wanted a lot of the scare sequences to play really silent. But, what I like to do with the soundtrack is set you on edge with a really loud, sort of like, atonal scratchy violin score, mixing with some really weird piano bangs and take that away and all of a sudden, you're like, 'What just happened there?",Insidious

391,lauralmhs,"Got to be one of the scariest movies of all time, and coming from me, that's saying a lot!",9,4 April 2011,"As soon as I heard about the new movie Insidious, I said ""Oh boy, this is a MUST-SEE."" For as long as I can remember, I have been a fan of this genre. I'm not talking about the Freddie/Jason slasher-type films or the torture/amputation sicko-flicks, but the truly psychological twisters that do a number on your head.This is the story of a young family whose oldest child, Dalton, after a seemingly minor household accident, slips into a mysterious coma that medical science is unable to explain. Doctors and hospitals not being able to do anything for Dalton, his parents are forced to take the not-quite-living-but-not-quite-dead boy home where he lies in his room completely unresponsive. Spectral entities are soon haunting the house, or so it seems, but when the family moves to a new home, the haunting continues; hence the tagline: ""It's not the house that's haunted."" Turns out little Dalton has entered The Further, a sort of nether-world where evil spirits vie to inhabit his body. At some point his grandmother (played by Barbara Hershey) hires a psychic who sends the boy's father into The Further to search for him and hopefully bring him back via some sort of astral projection or out-of-body experience. Insidious did not disappoint. Although highly derivative, that is not a bad thing here. It has elements of every one of my favorite ghost stories: The Haunting (haunted house, unexplained noises), The Innocents (possessed child, ghostly apparitions, eerie weeping), The Others (creepy climactic séance), Flatliners (crossing over into another realm) and Carnival of Souls (pale-faced ghoulies coming to get ya). Very much like the aforementioned The Haunting, most of the early scares in Insidious rely on sound, lighting and camera angles. Because of the way tension builds up (like in Paranormal Activity), the sight of a face eerily appearing in a window, or a sudden loud noise, can make you jump out of your seat. The beginning of the movie is all about suggestion, mood and atmosphere, and what you don't see, which are the elements of the very BEST ghost stories.Special commendation for the excellent editing. As much as you might want to shield your eyes in anticipation and dread while watching this movie, you won't want to miss some of the split-second spine-tingling images.My only complaint is that the last one-third or so of the film was almost over-kill. The scares were so relentless toward the conclusion of the story, you barely have time to recover from one fright before another is foisted on you. Nevertheless, there are some truly frightening images in this movie. I have seen many many such movies (and have read even more such novels) and I consider myself pretty jaded and not easily frightened, but I am a little embarrassed to admit that one scene in particular actually made me scream out loud in the movie theater - a first for me! By film's end, my heart was literally pounding. If you are highly suggestible or prone to nightmares, do not see this film, but if you are truly a fan of a good ghost/haunted house story, do not miss Insidious. Got to be one of the scariest movies of all time.",Insidious
392,Mykewood,"Wow, what a turd.",1,22 April 2011,"This movie was slow, boring, & painful. But at least it was long! They took some of the basic story lines of Poltergeist & the Exorcist & made a ""new"" movie out of them.The beginning is way too long & drawn out.Then the rest is goofy &/or predictable. The assistants coming to evaluate if the situation was real is pointless. The medium already knew the father's history, so she knew it was most likely real. Was she testing her assistants? What was the point? Couldn't it have been for the audience's sake? We've already seen proof by then, as have the parents. So all that was a waste. It felt like it was just so they could ""shock"" us with blaring music notes while we see ""creepy"" ghosts in corners. We've seen all that before. It's a cliché & it wasn't needed.The father not realizing he was actually asleep & outside his body has also been done before. Several times So much that's it's expected. When it's expected, it's not scary or shocking, it's boring. Him walking thru the realm of darkness wasn't bad. But again, it seems like it was so they could shock us with more extremely loud music notes & ghosts with creepy smiles. How many times has that been done before? Seriously.Simply a bad movie! Go watch the Exorcist & Poltergeist. You'll see what they were trying to do here, only better.",Insidious
393,tomreves,"decent, but nothing special",6,22 April 2011,"I read some reviews here before watching this film, and at first glance this movie seemed to be very promising. However I didn't feel very scary while watching this film because the plot was easily predictable and primitive at times.The costumes and special effects were not too sophisticated.What rescued this film from disaster is an incredible acting by Patrick Wilson, Rose Byrne and Ty Simpkins. They are the reason this movie was worth watching, but due to flawed plot I am forced to get 4 point away from this film.The problem with these kind of films is that closed space, i.e. haunted house, was used so many times before in other horror movies, that the more you watch such movies, the more silly they look. I love such films as Paranormal activity, or Blair witch project, as they are original in context of other horror movies. A lot of already seen details are not scary anymore, movie-makers have to think more to get an interesting horror movie now.",Insidious
394,NuthinSpecial,"It was good, but will be forgotten.",7,1 April 2011,"I'm going to go ahead and say that ""Insidious"" is one of the best PG-13 horror movie of the past twenty years, or at least of the 2000's, only to be beaten out by ""Drag Me to Hell."" ""Insidious"" is really scary. Let me just state that now. It is scary because it takes successful horror movies, what was scary about them, and applies them. I noticed some parts borrowed from ""Poltergeist"", ""Drag Me to Hell"", and of course, ""Paranormal Activity."" All of which were scary on their own by using their own method. Notice how i said ""borrowed"" and not ""stolen."" This is only because ""Insidious"" was not a flop, but rather a hit in the horror industry. It's true, the first half of the movie is way more scary than the second. Once the actual story starts to unfold, it feels more like a video game. Yes, i know, it is weird to compare a horror movie to a video game, but i felt as though i was in Silent Hill towards the ending. Not that thats a bad thing, but it is honestly how i felt. All in all ""Insidious"" is really good, but in the near future i feel it will be forgotten. it doesn't go the extra mile, and isn't an achievement in the horror industry. If you are a horror fan, i suggest seeing it and play a game where you point out what parts are borrowed. If you're not a horror fan, take your girlfriend/ boyfriend to see it, because it is that scary.",Insidious
395,dp-brightful,Straight Up Creepy!!!,8,11 November 2012,"If you are looking for a true horror flick, not a slasher film or some scary / comedy flick, but a TRUE horror film then check this one out. Have to give it 8/10 because it's been since the original Exorcist that I have truly been creeped out. The story itself seems familiar at first. A family has a problem with a haunted house. Seen it 1,000 times, right? Not so fast. The story develops into something reasonably unique and gives us a plausible plot. Good story line throughout the film. It moves along quickly and is well directed and edited. Great visuals, music and acting. This should be the new model for horror. Best horror film in the past 30 years IMO.",Insidious
396,RoshanJG,A Horror movie with a difference,10,26 June 2011,"Watching this horror movie was very enjoyable..unlike most movies of this genre that have innumerable clichés ,insidious managed to stay away from most of them.. Acting from Patrick William and rose were on the spot.. Direction was also great. This movie is indeed a must watch for any horror fans.. The scare tactics used in this movie is also excellent and is well placed.Another plus point for insidious is its soundtrack and its usage in the movie.... The movie doesn't have dull moments and once the plot sets in ,you are certainly in for a ride.I feel that insidious is one step ahead of paranormal activity and fans of PA wont be disappointed with Insidious.. The best horror movie of 2011 so far....",Insidious
397,aweynand96,The exact opposite of what I expected; incredibly frightening.,7,15 June 2011,"I have seen a very large amount of horror films such as this one; the whole haunted house setup, the possessed child, et cetera. Having said this, I expected this to be just one more ""Amityville Horror"" kind of movie. Yet I heard good words about it and I went to see it with a couple buddies. It got me from the start; the eerie music, the creepy scenes, everything. Yes, it was ultimately a cliché, as many movies similar to this have been done, but in a way, Insidious made a name for itself in being nearly perfect with timing, lighting, the music, the setup, etc. It was original on its own. It was one of those rare horror films where instead of delivering constant cheap scares and suspense buildups that result in merely a cat from behind a door or something like that, it had real, intense moments where you will be squealing and jumping from your seat. Pop-ups come at completely random times, where you are 100% vulnerable and are not expecting it, and boy does it get you good. When the elderly lady is describing the demon to the father and mother in the kitchen scene, and the demon suddenly appears behind the father out of nowhere, snarling, I screamed and so did my friends. Not only random pop-ups, but subtle ones, too, that have you thinking and freaking out at the same time. From start to finish, this film will have you reeling, and a MORE than satisfying ending that will you keep you up for days. Not completely original, but definitely a must-see for horror fans. It's probably the scariest movie I have ever seen.",Insidious

I was expecting a run of the mill scary little movie but what I saw was a genuinely creepy film with some real scares. Now I've been watching horror movies for a long, long time now and I love them. There is something primal about that feeling of unease and terror that accompanies real scary films. This film has it. The acting is good, great main cast with brilliant support. A nod to other films and a blink and you'll miss it Jigsaw reference. The direction is awesome and the team behind the original Saw prove that they know how to make a good horror movie. On the whole if you like feeling uneasy and being scared then this could be one for you. My girlfriend thoroughly enjoyed this film from behind her jumper and a cushion. That sort of scares is rare indeed.",Insidious
400,thenachoman,If you like supernatural horror - Insidious is top class,8,28 April 2013,"I'm writing this at 11.33 pm on Sunday night after watching Insidious. I'm telling myself I'm writing the review now because I want to get it done before I forget the details of the movie. The reality is I'm doing it now because I don't want to walk downstairs in the dark. Or brush my teeth in front of a mirror where something could suddenly appear behind me. I have Insidious to thank for turning me into a wussy scaredy cat.Supernatural horror movies, especially those that involve some kind of demon, are one of my favourite genres. I've watched all the ones I know about, which is a fair few. The Exorcist remains at the top. Sinister is a fantastic recent example. And Insidious is another example of the genre done right.The thing that makes Insidious most effective is that it's very well put together - good acting, great (and creepy as hell) cinematography, believable script, eerie music and jump out of your seat sound effects. In some horror movies where one of these parts is off, it can let the whole movie down. In Insidious all parts are done very effectively. The end result is a film that will have you on edge the whole way through.Unlike some horror movies - the worst recent example being Mama - the characters in Insidious are not stupid. When Renai (Rose Byrne - very effective in her role) realises her house is haunted, she wants to leave - immediately. Josh, the father, also believes. Seeing a room destroyed by the powers of the ghost is enough to convince him the house is haunted. These nods to rationality make the movie believable, which is always going to be a challenge when dealing with this genre. My rule of thumb is that if by half way through the characters are acting how I would act - I'm as scared as they are.The story itself is a nice take on the genre especially the last 20 minutes. I sometimes get really frustrated with these movies because the characters are never given a way to fight back. In Insidious this isn't quite the case, which is a nice change.Finally - the twist at the end is terrifying. It is exactly what I didn't want (and yet kind of did), but deep down was expecting.I really enjoyed Insidious and can't wait for the sequel...just give me a few months to recover from this one...",Insidious
401,zombie134,"Decent film, stays fun! Lighten up movie know it all!",6,1 January 2012,"I will say that most of these reviews are correct about Insidious. It does borrow a lot from other films. No there are no Academy Award winning performances. No it's not the Exorcist. All that being said for the so called movie review ""experts"" here on IMDb lets remember what movies are for. They are for entertainment.What this film wasn't was the waste of money some people state here. Come on guys. This film was fun. Great camera work here akin to House on Haunted Hill. Awesome music, combined with the odd camera angles makes for unsettling suspense. I also liked the new angles on old concepts.This movie ultimately does not take itself too seriously and that is important. Maybe thats what causes some fellow movie goers to go out of their way to rip this movie to shreds. There are very serious horrors that are the comparisons. The Exorcist, the Sixth Sense, Night of the Living Dead...these classics are for the most part totally humorless and damn scary. Insidious does not fall into this bracket. Phantasm, the Evil Dead, Nightmare on Elm Street, Poltergiest...these movies remind me a little of Insidious.If you haven't seen it it's worth watching to judge for yourself. People go way overboard with these reviews. Its not Shawshanks Redemption but it's not Superbabies 2, lol.",Insidious

403,tomas208,The most respectable horror movie so far this century,10,6 September 2013,"If you, like me, are a fan of the old ways, you should not be disappointed by this movie. Usually when there's a new horror movie the conditions for being scared are nullified from the get-go because of all the irritating traits like ""young people who speak in the latest cool way of speaking"" and special effects/monsters that could be deemed ""wild and crazy"". Or, if they're going for a more subtle feel it usually ends up like a goth rock music video or a new age medium TV show. The somewhat young couple in this movie thankfully act a bit older than they are (at least by today's standards) and help the movie maintain a bit of, if you could use such a word today, ""solemnity"". It's amazing that it can be combined with the movie actually being really over-the- top in some departments. It's just done with that 70s/80s Italian style, in some way, where you could freak out with themes and still maintain respectability. Mixed with the Asian style of the 90s and early 00s (Ringu etc) where horror is so much magnified due to the down-to-earth tone and lack of Hollywood modernness.",Insidious

405,mlunsworth,Delirious. Mysterious. This is Insidious...,6,9 May 2011,"With the makers of the original Saw and Paranormal Activity behind this, I was very intrigued to see how they would deliver a new angle to the haunted house premise. The result? A deliciously neat, scary and tense (if not, a bit ridiculous) ride which should please most horror fans.Insidious is creepy for all the right and wrong reasons. Yes, it's very tense in parts, and the supernatural forces that overpower the house are enough to make even the toughest of people jump out of their seats, but when old women start wearing gas masks to talk to spirits, and ghouls start looking something like Darth Maul, you'll start to find it very creepy indeed. It also features two idiotic and not-so-amusing policemen, who really don't fit in place for this horror film, and should belong in a scene from something like Ghostbusters, and the final part may seem a bit far-fetched and OTT. However, even though it may drag on in parts, Insidious is better than your average standard haunted house tale.The film does very well on the shock factor, and never have I been in a packed cinema where most of the audience scream out loud and fix themselves solidly to the screen for the 98 minute run. James Wan certainly knows how to satisfy his audience, and Insidous will certainly play on your imagination, even if it may be for all the wrong reasons.So if you're a fan of the genre and like films such as Poltergeist, Paranormal Activity and The Amityville Horror, this'll be perfect for you as it's simply great haunted-house-horror. And it wouldn't be right if the makers of Saw didn't include a final twist at the end. Well, watch this until the very last scene and you'll be in for a subtle treat. I'm sure a sequel will be soon to follow. 6/10",Insidious
406,lauren_mayte_x,Couldn't of asked for anything more.,10,6 May 2011,"Insidious is... Brilliant. I entered the cinema having absolutely no clue as to what I was in for and as the film started I began doubting the movie as the music was a little over the top for my taste, I wouldn't of seen the plot coming in a million years. I'm not going to spoil any of it for you because I am extremely glad that I didn't know what to expect before seeing this film, I went through so many different emotions throughout the duration of the movie and loved that it was so fresh and really did the horror genre proud! It's been an incredibly long time since I've seen a horror movie that I left satisfied with, well I left the cinema with shivers down my spine as the music started again and the massive red block letters of INSIDIOUS appeared on the screen. The ending will leave you in a state and I can confidently say that if you're the same as me, it's like watching a whole movie about your worst nightmares as a kid. I definitely recommend this to anyone that has missed watching a movie that gives you the shakes, makes your pulse race and leaves you terrified. A definite 10/10 from me and a guarantee that I'll be having nightmares tonight, completely worth it.",Insidious
407,timharries,Are You Kidding Us?,5,10 May 2011,"Midway through ""Insidious"", James Wan's foray into the haunted house genre, comes a moment so misjudged and tonally out of joint, that a cynic might ponder the real intention of those behind this fitfully scary horror romp. I mention it purely because what has gone on up until this point has been for the most part, effective and enjoyable.The premise of the upwardly mobile WASP family having their nest hauled apart by forces unseen is hardly groundbreaking territory, but the slow disintegration of this cosy, tad too opulent bubble invites the same hint of schadenfreude that audiences may have felt when spirits trashed designer chic in genre bedfellow ""Paranormal Activity"". (Notably, director Oren Peli takes the role of producer here) The restraint Wan uses in the first portion of the film must be applauded. Much like ""Paranormal Activity"" the key lies in the domestic space and in the seemingly mundane. Our first glimpses of the ""other"" are brilliantly executed - more often than not we are left in horrible dread - what was it that just marched across the balcony? where in god's name did that child in Victorian dress disappear to? The zenith of all this creeping tension comes at that most benign of places; at the dining table, (and in broad daylight) a hideous apparition that comes at you in a snarling flash. A knee jerk moment that sets the film at a cracking pace, raising audience expectation to giddy heights.Such a tragedy it is then that the film dissolves so rapidly into a fairground/video game aesthetic, negating all of the good work gone on before in place of ill-judged, generic thrills that feel as creaky and predictable as the last time you were in a haunted house ride.To take us back then to the point at which ""Insidious"" takes that fatal stumble: just when our nerves are suitably raw, we see the introduction of two ""ghostbuster"" dudes, who trade funnies with each other like extras in a Judd Apatow vehicle. Comic relief is entirely justified and a lot of the time, expected in horror films. The banter here though is on display for too long - the characters come off as too smart, too knowing, thus plunging proceedings into doubt.When ""busting"" parafernalia is brought out we snigger, a ripple of derision that picks at all the plausibility carefully in place. When a medium starts to do her thing, (whilst wearing a gas mask no less) those sniggers turn into out and out howls of laughter - the like of which no amount of spooks or kooks could ever hope to dispel.In short, a great opening 45 minutes followed by a needlessly botched second half. How sad that it is that it should be two of the characters in the film that reveal the smoke and mirrors, from which all of the film's horror emanates.",Insidious
408,michael-neichl-904-632888,"Two stars for the two moments I got ""scared""",4,2 August 2011,"And scared isn't the right word because I define scared as feeling uncomfortable and exhausted and just wanting to pause the movie to watch something less scary (like when I watched paranormal activity, that was a great movie) But I jumped two times when an unsuspecting jump-cut happened. Thats it! The rest of the movie is for those who have never seen a horror movie, then it probably is pretty scary, the scenery isn't too bad but the story, the characters, the shock moments you know absolutely every scene and what's going to happen next.So like I said those who love clichéd horror movies or who never saw a classic horror title may have a pretty good time.",Insidious
409,arisdisc,Best of this genre I've seen in many years,9,12 July 2011,"EXCEPTIONAL shocker. I was pleasantly surprised at how meticulously each 'shock' was carried out. Nearly every single one of them worked. As someone who has lived long enough to experience the horror/sci-fi craze of the 50's and 60's (where William Castle laid down the groundwork for the 'shock' sequence) this movie would make Bill proud. Ignore the 1 and 2 star reviews that are permeating this entry on IMDb. Those, apparently, are from viewers who revel in torture/gushing blood/and the thrill of intestines on the highway etc. etc. (which frankly, are beginning to bore me).

As a horror movie, it did its job scaring me, but don't be scared by the people who tell you this is the scariest movie they've ever seen (although those are individual opinions). I bought this one after seeing Sinister and Paranormal Activity and used those two as standards, so I was all set for a good old' mental breakdown. And the first half hour was SCARY. But after that... it's a very strange way to do a horror movie. The standard is often to build tension before unleashing hell at the end. Insidious doesn't. It's intense from the start on, already showing off a creepy old ghost-lady, eerie music and a semi jump-scare before the five minute mark. But beware that the first hour might leave you shaky enough to break down during the rest of the film, that (sadly) just goes bananas with ghosts, demons, loud noises and unsettling visual details. Know this: the rating is wrong. Do NOT turn this on for your 13 year old, people. Norwegian censorship gave it a PG18, but I would say the correct one would be around 15.

411,radoii_87,Lifeless camera eye,4,6 February 2014,"This fails both in terms of writing and execution. It's a shame that innovation within the horror genre has been close to non-existent in the past couple of decades, especially in Hollywood. This is so simple and formulaic that it looks silly instead of scary. We have a family where the dad and his son are able to travel from one reality to another during their sleep(""astral projection""). At the end, the dad must battle his own repressed memories and fears to bring his son from the ""dead"".The writing had some of the essential structural elements for it to work. However, part of the problem for me here was that the ""reality of the dead"" was underdeveloped which made it difficult to believe and become invested in. The tension and the energy, that I saw glimpses of in ""Saw"", were absent as well. It seems that James has lost his way somewhat. Horror thrives on the synchronization of musical patterns with the dance of the camera eye. Unfortunately, the camera here is lifeless.This made a lot of money. I wonder if the viewers will trust James next time. But yet again, I am not sure if we remember what a well-made horror movie looks like.2/5 - FormulaicP.S.

I watched many scary movies and Insidious is the one that really made it sound and seems so real that it allows audience relate to it. I was expecting to see some people died in horrible way where their guts and bloods are everywhere and floor splashed with red tomato juices.

415,Leviathan80,Promising start but intensity spoiled half way through by unoriginal tropes and poorly conceived images.,5,28 November 2015,"Insidious is one of those movies I avoided. I don't jump on fads. I am very hipster when things don't fit into my nerd realm. That goes hardcore for movies. Insidious was one of those scary movies that came out and blew up. I hated this trend of the next scary movie banking at the box office when my idea of real horror was passed over. It seemed like every year there was a new scary movie or a sequel to a new scary movie. They were all a year or two years apart. Have to bank on that hype right? Right from the start I was going in with a negative sense of view. But I thought that if I was watching it then there was something about it that appealed to me. The film stars Patrick Wilson and Rose Bryne as loving parents who start experiencing odd occurrences in their new home. When the events escalate they move to a new house and realize there is something more involved. It's a haunted house story with a 'twist'. From the start of the film you can tell even with the budget James Wan as a director is talented.It is the exact duo that brought us the Saw franchise. James Wan is behind the lens with Leigh Whannell writing and acting. Technically the film looks great. There are some inventive shots and the ending haunt is staged very well. But the story feel like it's been done before. There are all sorts of elements from multiple haunted house films. If a film could be called a mash up I would give this film that title. Wilson and Bryne do their best with that they have. The story fails them. When things start to ramp up everything of the why is explained by a newly emerged character.There is a back story to why this is all happen. This is not explained until nearly the end of the film. It's newly introduced characters that wrap up everything in a nice tight package. Some of the back story is shown but not much. It would have been nice if these piece of the story were scattered throughout the entire film. I wasn't really scared as the 'boo' scares weren't stage that well. It was more of putting things for the audience to jump instead of building tension. The most entertaining and well executed sequence was the ending.There was a nice twist at the end that on it's own would have sat very well. But knowing that there is a sequel comes off as strategically place for a sequel to be made. There is just too much hype surround this film and for me it didn't (never had the chance) to live up to it. Seeing Sinister and The Conjuring (from James Wan) I know there are good haunted house films out there that live up to the hype. I can only describe this film with a quote taken from a user on Reddit, ""I think the reason so many people like it and praise it is because it is so bland; it feels safe. It's the movie the average moviegoer can go to, not get too scared, but still say that they love a horror movie."" Well said.",Insidious

Nervous mother, annoying kids, working father. Mother sees and hears stuff and its really pretty suspenseful. Spoilers from now on: If you watch this movie, and you don't want it to drown itself in hilarity and rather want to keep a memory of a decently scary movie, then stop watching at the point where Elise describes the demon sitting on the ceiling. Seriously, from that moment on everything gets really stupid and looks like a bad musical.The film really switches from a serious ghost movie to Charlie and the chocolate factory.

I wouldn't go so far as to call it 'original', but it possesses original qualities! It seems some reviewers want EVERY movie to be 100% original, otherwise its no good (giving them ratings between 1 and 5 stars of 10) which is a ridiculous way to review movies.

I don't think I have ever jumped more during any other scary movie. The audience was spooked too. I saw many other people jumping out of their seats and even heard a few actual screams.What I loved about this movie was that it actually tries to scare you, not gross you out.

It was not the writing or the acting, just that in the context of the movie up to that point it didn't work for me. Next,...the last 30 minutes(roughly) was just not very good. If any movie could benefit from special effects this was it. I'm trying not to give too much away here, it's hard to, blah, too late,...astrological body...the further(this was a great concept)(could have been a great title too, a little cliché perhaps yeah, but then again the movie became so cliché when it entered the further)...back to the point...It would have been so much better to have the scenes in 'the further' less, idk...earthly, if the people didn't look like people, if it was not set in an earthly environment(a house). And the costumes, especially the fire face, omg, looked like darth maul to me, lmao; The whole movie just fell apart for me in the last half hour, very disappointing, because it started off so well. All in all, worth watching, I did enjoy it. It had potential to be a classic, a great, but ended up being just good, just descent.",Insidious
423,fashionable_boy420,"Deserves to be in IMDb Top 250, and Should have been appreciated a bit more",10,1 September 2013,"The movie is as good as any horror movie one can get. I definitely wanna see this movie in the top 250. And one's rarely gonna see anything better than this. From the beginning till the end,everything is perfectly done be it the acting or the plot itself.Its a delight for all the horror movie fans out there. I strongly recommend this movie to everyone. Many reviews out there compare it with the 'Poltergeist' and term it as a poor remake. But I just don't agree with any of those reviews, although everyone is free to express themselves wherever and whenever they feel like. This movie is among my all time favorite horror movies.However, the only problem with this movie is its depiction of the demon. The special effects/graphics could have been better. But they still could convey what they wanted to show(also one should keep this in mind that this is actually a low budget movie). Moreover, the fear/scare in the movie doesn't come from looking at the demon, but by the plot and the story of the movie.Just don't get confused by reading any of the negative reviews out there and give this movie a fair chance. I'm certain that this movie is gonna entertain like any horror movie fan out there and will definitely give one a good scare with quite a few frightening moments, some goosebumps and a feeling of uneasiness throughout.Despite being not a perfect movie i still rate it 10/10, may be I could have rated it 9/10 but I want the movie to move up a bit in overall IMDb ratings.",Insidious
424,jessicabailey68,What a let down,4,31 October 2020,"We had trouble deciding between this and Sinister. I was told by a handful of people that this movie would keep me up or give me nightmares.
It was pretty lame. Had they just kept it as a haunting without these weird ghosts walking around with terrible make-up and costumes, they may have had me. But the Darth Maul looking guy and his weird hooves, so silly. Almost reminded me of the devil in the Tenacious D movie. I would have much rather had Dave Grohl show up.
I wanted to take it seriously, but I couldn't. It was just awful. If I was that type of person, I would sue every single one of the people that told me this movie would terrify me. I'll stick with the Exorcist, thank you.",Insidious
425,aaronadoty,"After a strong start, ""Insidious"" fails to deliver",5,5 August 2015,"""Insidious"" has a number of things going for it: a stylish credit sequence, with an old- school giallo feel to it, and enhanced by the creepy still images; a gorgeous house as the setting for the first part of the movie, which builds some great atmosphere; and a spookily discordant stringed-instrument score (though it has a tendency to overwhelm the action on occasion). There is also an excellent jump-scare about halfway through that caused me to call out involuntarily as I sat watching the movie in my empty living room. Unfortunately, the shift in action from the 'haunted' house also sees the movie lose its way. The characters proliferate, but fail to add depth, and as Rose Byrne's 'woman on the verge' storyline fades into the background, so does any sense of compelling narrative. The action takes an unwelcome baroque turn, and the attempts at humor do not add to a series of sequences that commit the grievous sin of failing to be even remotely scary. After a promising start, the disappointing second and third acts feel like they have been pasted in from another movie altogether.",Insidious
426,rafaelsimer,...just more of the same.,3,12 November 2017,"Well, it tried. This James Wan dude thinks himself as the king of horror and stuff, but he ain't. The simple fact that he worked on those ""Saw"" films makes me loose respect for him. Those things were ridiculous! So, obviously, the saga was a bit hit.""Insidious"" was a suggestion from a friend, since we like similar movies. Then, I saw that Patrick Wilson and James Wan (I didn't know about his connection with ""Saw"" yet) were int it, and since they worked in ""The Conjuring"" (which is pretty good) I was expecting something good.I'll admit that I forced myself to watch it until the end. No, it wasn't scary. Wan' s vision of horror is simple: you look now and see nothing, you turn around and ""boo, I'm behind you"" and violins playing in the highest pitch possible. That's not horror, that's just...annoying.The entire film is a collection of clichés and is completely predictable. It begins with the common formula: ""Oh, we're a young family, struggling to make ends meet while pursuing a dream. We're good and kind parents of some little children. In spite of the difficulties, love keeps us together. We've just moved into a new house, so I hope nothing bad happens."". But, of course, bad things do happen. And the first thing the mom thinks is that the house is haunted. Duh, obviously, uh? And even never going to church, she calls in the local priest. After all, all priests know of demonic possessions, how to guide people through the problems, and whenever you call them, they'll come right away. Yeah, I don't really think that priests have much to do on their daily lives.So, the clichés never end. You already know what's going to happen on the next 10 or 20 minutes. Why did I watch it? Well, I was curious, it was late at night and I didn't feel like browsing and picking movies again...it sucks.Most of the clichés are the basic: problems from the past reappear, the children are the targets, the mom suffers and nearly goes insane, the father is skeptic at first but then believes her, the child already knew about those things and had been drawing about it for a long time (and no on never noticed it), some tech dudes walk in with cameras and other instruments in order to pick up and electromagnetic fields the ghosts leave behind, the old lady shows up and is an expert in the subject and can talk ""to the other side"", where the dead reside and suffer forever, the evil dead want the child's mind. And, of course, there's a demon.Wow, being dead must suck. Pain and suffering forever, having to fight a demon to win a healthy living body, just so you can inflict pain upon others.And it goes on and on and on until it reaches its predictable end.",Insidious

There's the odd jump scare in a movie and that's about it. But this movie has you on edge from start to finish. Right when you think nothing is going to happen, BAM it happens. I love it!

428,Jigsaw_At_The_Disco,Insidious Is Scary -- What More Do You Want?,7,21 April 2011,"James Wan, the director of the cult classic SAW returns to make what might be one of the greatest PG-13 horror films ever made. Things may start off a bit slow, but when things start to get rolling the scares don't stop until the very end. You'll be grabbing your arm chair and covering your mouth to avoid screaming the entire time. Let me just say that this review is coming from a very skeptical, very anti-horror film kind of guy. I had low expectations for Insidious and was expecting to just laugh and make fun of the dumb characters on screen. Instead, I was met with an intense and sometimes just downright scary thriller that had me at the edge of my seat to the very end. I think what holds this entire movie together is the music. It intensifies every situation and is what separates its self from other realistic horror movies like Paranormal Activity, which for the sake of realism, didn't have any. The screeching violins, and banging and clawing come together to make a reckless, terrifying soundtrack that ensures that your scared even with your eyes closed. Another strength that Insidious has and most horror movies don't is great acting. The entire cast, although small, makes this film very believable. The main characters feel real so you care what happens to them. Most horror movies fail to make you care at all about any of the characters involved, but you're able to connect with them in Insidious. The script writing is good, I can see some of the lines from this becoming remembered like the famous, ""He doesn't want us to cut off our chains. . .he wants us to cut off our feet"" line from Saw. I'm not gonna spoil anything but the ending sort of let me down and left some questioned unanswered. Other then that, I enjoyed the script and every development within the film.The bottom line is Insidious has everything you could possibly want from a PG-13 horror film and more. It's scary but it's also really good. I can see this becoming a cult classic in the near future. Anyone who enjoys horror movies will DEFINITELY enjoy this. However, this can be enjoyed by anyone. There's absolutely no gore and nothing that'll really gross you out if that's not your thing and I think that's just one more thing that makes Insidious so good. It'll make you scared out of your mind without blood and guts, something that horror movies can't seem to do nowadays.***/*****",Insidious

We are long time horror fans and love scary movies. Unfortunately it took so long for the movie to start to unfold that we got bored. It didn't take 90 minutes to tell this story and then 10 minutes of semi excitement. It was also very easy to see what was going to happen. We practically predicted every scene before it happened. It was very predictable. Every once in a while a loud sound would occur and I guess this was the ""scary"" parts. It almost seemed like one of those spoof movies because it took a part of many other recent films and put it all together. Then in the end for the last 10 minutes we laughed and said how will they set this up for a sequel. I will not see this movie again. It was downright boring at times and the story took forever to tell. You wanted something to happen and it just never did until the end, and even that wasn't exactly life changing. In todays movie world where horror/scary movies are as rare as it gets, Insidious is just in the long line of flops. The standards are so low.

It's the equivalent of making a movie about space travel where rocket ships are sent into orbit on the power released by lighting a fart on fire.On that note, this film is the best comedy of the year. Not a ghost to be found here and there's all kinds of comic mishaps involving astral projection and lost souls.I give it a big thumbs up for making me laugh so hard, but my monkey apparently was none-too-pleased and decided to astrally project himself to a Dutch whorehouse instead.What can I say?

434,Sean_Friel,A bog standard horror with its fair share of fun jump scares,5,19 April 2020,"Insidious, follows the story of a family who have recently moved into a new home. Their eldest son falls into a coma and with that a number of paranormal occurrences follow.The film is certainly fun. Its use of a number of different scary demons will definitely cause you to feel uneasy.Rose Byrne's role as the mother is very well executed and appears to be a natural one. Byrne's caring nature will have audiences sympathising at her situation as the family's life is thrown into turmoil.Patrick Wilson, who by observation appears to be in every other recent horror film made stars as the father in the film. Wilson's performance is unconvincing at best. You get a sense he is uncomfortable in the role which takes away from the film.There is a lot to be desired with the plot. The unoriginal approach to a haunted house and a possessed child story is one replicated far too often. The story is all over the place. It feels as if the writers have sacrificed continuity for jump scares which comes across as lazy.The idea of sleep paralysis in the film is something that personally sparked an interest. An interesting subject with little understanding the horror of sleep paralysis is very real. I'll give credit to the writers for that decision.Side characters, a lovable psychic and her comical geeky assistants do offer up a few unnecessary laughs. These characters do add to what is an non-debatable mediocre film.Insidious although poor in execution is what it is. A silly horror film that will appeal to mainstream audiences has been understandably popular. I'd certainly say it's worth the watch especially with a group as it will definitely provide a night of entertainment.Although not a classic of the genre, Insidious will certainly cement its place as a horror that will always be brought up in discussion.",Insidious

436,leahcsykes,"Incredible start, bad ending.",7,30 July 2020,"When I first went to watch Insidious, I was unsure what to think of it. Most reviews I'd read were either very positive or negative and I wasn't really sure what advice to take.So I turned on Netflix on my tv. This was a good decision, as after a second watch I find it's much better on a bigger screen. The opening sequence began, and I was reminded of other movies such as Birdemic: Shock and Terror, that used long opening credits to compensate for lack of runtime.Seriously though guys, this sequence is LONG. It's pretty much 5 minutes of creepy music and imagery. Things weren't looking up.But in the first few scenes of the movie, I was pleasantly surprised. The movie had set a pretty good atmosphere, and it felt like there was ok character development.Then came the scene that might make or break a horror movie: the first scare. Dalton (the kid) was climbing a ladder to turn on a light, but we already knew that one of the rungs was broken. I was physically cringing as he climbed the ladder, knowing exactly what would happen.Basically Dalton hit his head and there may or may not have been some kind of demon. Then the parents did the natural thing and sent a child with a concussion to bed!Admittedly, the parents in this movie are classic horror protagonists. And by that I mean stupid. They make about 4 terrible decisions throughout the movie that made me scream at the tv.So, next thing you know, Dalton's in a coma, and the parents have to take care of him. They have to go through their day again, this time without Dalton.What follows is one of the most effective sequences in the movie, in my opinion. One of the other kids asks the mom to move him out of Dalton's room because, ""I don't like it when he walks around at night.""Then the parents go to bed, but are woken up by an insanely annoying alarm. The dad goes downstairs, and finds the door wide open. Then, we get jumpscared by the alarm again. It's annoying, but actually effective.Then, later, the mom is writing a song. Oh, I forgot to say, she writes songs. She hears something weird on the baby monitor, and goes upstairs to check on the baby.So we see a weird guy standing over the baby, and the mom gets scared. The dad didn't see it and he doesn't believe her.The parents go to bed, but the dad, Josh, gets up. The mom, Renee, sees a guy walking outside of the window. For some reason, he teleports inside. Weird but actually very scary.Renee wants to move so Josh and the rest of the family agree to so they buy a new house and move Dalton, who's still in a coma, by the way.But even when they move, the problems still bother them. Renee, in the scariest scene of the movie, sees a little boy dancing to Tiny Tim's ""Tiptoe Through The Tulips""She goes inside to see where he is, but he's gone. So she calls her mother, who leads her to a woman who says she can solve it named Elise. She sends Josh into a world called the further to rescue Dalton.So far, I was amazed at the quality of this Conjuring-style thriller. But things go way downhill from here.First of all Darth Maul shows up. Literal Darth Maul. I'm not kidding. The creature design is so laughable that it's more funny than scary. And later he turns into a spider. Yes, a spider.But Josh comes back and meets a childhood nightmare THAT WE KNEW NOTHING ABOUT SO FAR, turns into it, and kills Elise. Dalton wakes up, but he and Renee are left on the run.Normally, I love ambiguous endings, but this feels like they just didn't really want to write one. No resolution at all, it's almost like they didn't bother finishing the story.This movie is a mixed bag which sometimes feels smooth and well written and sometimes like the writes just gave up. The last third of the movie is a stark contrast to the rest of it.But overall, this was enjoyable. If you separate the good from the bad, this was a pretty good movie.",Insidious

The astral projection thing worked fine and what I liked most was the way the story unfolded which is why I call it the best movie I have seen in a very long time. There is no hurry - things evolve naturally from good to weird to worse all the while you are comfortably knowing that you're in for a real treat. The cast and the acting was spot on. Rose Byrne is very convincing and sweet as the mother (Renai Lambert) who is the first to experience all those strange events. To Wan's credit I also liked the fact that she didn't freak out or that she and her husband (Josh, played by Patrick Wilson) didn't break up because she was hysterical and he just wouldn't understand. I really felt that they were a real-life couple, not just brought together by a script and a caster but in it together all the way.Let it speak for itself - if you like scary movies this is the one you shouldn't miss out on.I'll give 11 stars - the last one is for the goose bumps that just won't go away!",Insidious

James Wan did a very impressive for only an $800,000 budget for this movie. If you're going in the theatre expecting to see the typical, run of the mill, haunted house flick you will be sadly mistaken and surprisingly pleased at the same time. The parts that I liked most about the film is the detailing. Everything in the movie means something no matter how small and I love that when the suspense builds up for the audience to be scared, you won't be disappointed to find its just the dog or the tree brushing against the window....it will definitely be something to be scared of. The people sitting beside me kept laughing at me because whenever the suspense would build I would say to myself ""uh uh....uh uh"".But enough of my rambling, the plot was definitely original and James Wan and Leigh Schanell definitely succeeded in bringing the audience something scary, suspenseful, funny, emotional, and frightening all at the same time. The score is amazing. The use of all sound design was great specially since they weren't any fake screams. LOL. The best acting performance, hands down, was Lin Shaye. She did an amazing job with her role. I can't say anymore without spoiling the movie. All I can say is, if you LOVE a good scary movie then you must see this movie.",Insidious

However I felt the want to make mention on this movie, the first good horror movie I have seen in at least 6 years or so. All modern horror movies seem to want to throw blood and gore in every scene, so much so it just disgusts you(unless there is something wrong upstairs). I have no clue why modern writers/directors have to throw that crap in, it's just not scary.This is a good movie that takes horror a bit back to the roots, stuff that actually makes you jump and keeps you on the edge of your seat. Having said all this, I give it a 8/10 because the ending was horrible. Not going to say anything else, but they could have taken it in a much better direction(the last 15 minutes or so of the movie).

Especially when Tiny Tim came on, a perfect choice of creepy upbeat song. It combines elements of a lot of ghost/haunting movies, but with the added flair of another dimension and being able to see what its like. I love the actors in this movie, especially Rose Byrne, she's very likable and sympathetic as a mother.

You start to wonder how they are going to really hit the climax of the film. Then, it starts to turn into an over the top rip off of Poltergeist and Exorcist. Everything that made the film actually creepy and disturbing turned it into a three ring circus that killed any momentum made for the victims to be in danger as well as its creep tone.It's disappointing because this film looked as if it wasn't going to need hokiness as well as things popping out of nowhere to really get the viewer interested in watching, but the second half of the film negates that and over does it ten fold.Overall - Very disappointing.

That said, I would have liked this movie no matter who was had the lead roles. It is genuinely scary and uses horror conventions with insidious skill toward an ending that is both entertaining and unsettling. The humorous scenes are genuinely funny. I loved the way the movie turned ""Tiptoe through the Tulips"" into a counterpart to Schubert's Erl-King. The acting from both the leads and the character actors is excellent, especially the elderly exorcist. Wilson gives a selfless, rigorously character-based performance, and Byrne is moving as the grief-stricken mother.

A theater of 16 year olds didn't even scream through the movie.This movie could've been great, but was extremely poorly executed. The entire climax of the movie was a joke. The protagonist was essentially told he's ""invincible"" while in ghost world looking for his son. The viewmaster scene could've been good if they didn't flip to two girl ghosts from the 1800s (why not something scary and creepy looking???). The only scary ghost in the entire movie (the Undertaker) was severely underutilized and disposed of by the protagonist by a Bruce Lee double chest karate chop. The directors could've expanded the final scene of the movie by 1 still of a really scary ghost and left a lasting image on the audience but they inexplicably didn't.The idea was creative, the execution was horrible.

I tried everything, watching all sorts of movies, from classic horror to gory torture, but nothing worked. That is until I saw Insidious. For those of you who know horror, you will see how inspired this film really is. This is a true horror film that uses suspense and plot to lock the movie goer in. I appreciate that it was very well done and did not need to rely on gore and cheesy special effects to scare me. This movie had it all, weaving a plot that was original. You may hear some critics saying it was basically a combination of a bunch of other movies, but what movie isn't? Wan took a risk with talking about astral projection as the average person is not familiar with what this is. However, it worked perfectly for this movie and that is what sets it apart from the others. You can tell that this movie was very well thought out. This movie is suspenseful, visually stunning, terrifying, and pulls at the strings of spirituality. It is a classic masterpiece with a modern twist that will leave you begging for more. This is the first horror movie that I have enjoyed watching in a long time. Thank you Mr. Wan, my hat's off to you. And for all you skeptics out there, beware insidious.",Insidious
452,caviiar,Crunch time,9,30 March 2011,"Normally I review very good or really, really bad movies. This falls in the good category. We have to admit that making an original movie is specially difficult; there are too many common places, and while this movie visits quite a few of them, it introduces twists and surprises that takes you unprepared.The initial scene only makes sense once you have watched the last one, bringing the whole tale full-circle. The high-pitch music delivered with the initial title and then repetition with the closing title have devastating effects on your nerves. The depth of the title becomes more and more apparent as the final credits roll. Slowly you start thinking ""that was an insidious b..."". The execution of this film is superb.This is not to say that the movie is without flaws. There are several lost opportunities, and towards the end some of the carefully crafted eeriness dissolves... but only for a moment. This movie is a great piece that honors a crowded genre.",Insidious

It had some good moments but nothing serious. The only spooky moment is at the end and it lasts only for 5 seconds... The plot, though, was based in a pretty good idea... Watch it just to understand how marketing works and how a mediocre film is promoted like the ""scariest movie after The exorcist""... Oh, please! It only scared me as The grudge 2! And on how I see it Grudge 2 wasn't a film to make you scared but to make you bored! Acting was pretty good and music was also pretty good. PLOT: 7 ACTING: 6 SCARY MOMENTS: 3 DIRECTING: 4SO...

And it definitely shows. I was just looking at how much profit it had already made and I felt nauseous. I had to write this. All the reviews giving it high marks are so clearly FAKE. Or written by people with horrible taste when it comes to movies. The IMDb is being used as an advertising tool. Don't buy it. Don't buy a ticket for the movie. Its like throwing money out the window. It is impossible to write a comprehensive review of this crappy movie so I won't even try. The plot is standard in the beginning but turns outrageously ridiculous at the end. You might find yourself wondering who comes up with this kind of stupidity and who gave the screenplay a thumbs up for filming it. The acting is on the level with the movie. You will notice the incredibly loud and annoying background music, I guarantee it. I also guarantee you won't like it. I might call it watchable up until the little lady psychic from Poltergeist( same character, different actress ) is introduced. Her explanation of events turns the plot hilarious. Or outrageous. It depends how you look at it. And whether you spent money on it. And by the way, the main bad guy is a demon. Its a bad CGI character with hooves, black shiny body hair like a horse and a red face like Darth Maul. The other ghosts look like sick people with bad make up.AGAIN. THE MOVIE IS NOT WORTH WATCHING SO DON'T SPEND MONEY ON IT. If you are curious, wait for the DVD or get it some other way.",Insidious
455,movieexplosion,Scary as hell!!!,9,17 May 2011,This is top quality horror. It creeps inside you and gives some serious scares. When couple Josh(Patrick Wilson) & Renai(Rose Byrne) move into a new house with their young children one of their sons has an accident while exploring the attic. The next day he doesn't wake up and the doctors are baffled by his brain activity which is not usual for a coma. Things in the house then start to turn very creepy.... The likable Wilson here is the family man back to playing the nice guy we saw in 'Lakeview Terrace' & 'Watchmen' as opposed to his comedic villainous role in the recent 'A-Team'. Byrne here although playing a worn and stressed out mother still manages to look good and demonstrates her range. Also impressed with Lin Shaye(Magda from 'There's Something About Mary') playing it straight.This is a highly originally and engrossing horror and definitely up there with recent crowdpleasers like 'Drag Me To Hell' and 'Paranormal Activity'. See it at your peril...!,Insidious

My two favorite scenes were: 1. When the apparition walked back and forth across the window, suddenly appearing in her room. 2. Main character's encounter with the spooky family in ""The Further"" realm and their creepy wide-smile scene. I really thought some of the scare tactics were brilliant and surprisingly original, not to mention eerily realistic.

458,dms-21,Painful to watch,1,21 September 2013,"This movie is boring and painful to watch. The acting is mediocre at best, with the father, in particular, showing the emotional range of a clam. The story is trite. I kept waiting for some kind of kicker that would make the movie worth watching, but was left at the end feeling I'd wasted 2 hours and 20 minutes of my life.There are many bad horror movies made, but most of them at least try to compensate for bad acting and stupid plots with lots of sex, gore, or both. This one has neither.I can't believe they're making a sequel. Who are the people who would actually want to watch this?

459,mattangley,Scariest movie I've seen,9,12 June 2018,"I love the horror genre. I love being scared. Unfortunately most of today's horror movies dont have that effect on me anymore. This genre is being beat to death by cheap jump scares, really bad acting, and recycled plot lines. I still search for the few good ones amongst the bunch and often come out empty handed. It seems one good horror movie will come out every few years with a bunch of really bad ones to fill the gap between them. How's the saying go? You gotta kiss a lot of frogs before you find your prince. It's like that, but with moviesWell, Insidious was one of the good ones. No, scratch that. It was one of THE BEST horror movies I've ever seen to date. Right from the beginning with that unnerving low volume tone playing during the intro, I was already feeling anxious. I went and saw this in the theatre and I can honestly say it was the first time I've ever actually been scared at a movie. My palms were cold and clammy the entire time. It wasn't just a heart racing kind of scare during the scary scenes, but a kind of scary that makes you uncomfortable, even between scenes.Unfortunately they continue to cheapen this film by releasing terrible, awful, laughable sequels just to make a quick buck so I don't recommend even seeing them. Just watch this one. James Wan (director) used to be better. He's mainstreamed, however. How many spin-offs of the conjuring must we endure?",Insidious
460,mattangley,Unnerving suspense and dread throughout,9,16 June 2018,"I honestly don't know how this movie has such a low score. Even lower than The Descent, which is a cheap summer teen screen. Blah. Anyway, I'm a huge fan of horror. REAL horror. I appreciate being scared in an honest way, not by cheap jump scares like almost every horror movie made these days. So naturally I go through a lot of bad horror flicks before I find a good one in every hundred or so. When a movie has the ability to make my hair stand up numerous times with no jump scare involved, it makes it into my Blu Ray collection. This one made it in there as soon as it was released. I went and saw this in theatres and my hands were cold and clammy the entire time. I felt exhausted leaving the movies from being perpetually scared for a couple of hours. This movie has some of the best suspense I've experienced in years. Right from the opening credits while that eerie high pitched note plays, you're immediately put into an unnerving mood. Then the way James Wan actually scares you with true horror. Making you feel scared without needing to pull cheap jump scares to do it. Like in the scene where the demon is in Dalton's room when the mother is describing her dream. All you can see of him is the figure in the dimly lit room, which is scary enough on its own. Then She asks what he wants and all you see is the demon slowly point to dalton with a slight crackling sound as his arm moves. That's it. No jump scare, no cheap effects. Just pure dread. THATS horror! And that's what most of this movie is likeThen there's the score. The sound effects they use from yesteryear such as the slamming of random piano keys in scenes that scare you. Just hearing that jarring sound scares you enough. And I'll never be able to listen to ""tiptoe through the tulips"" the same way again. Ever.",Insidious
461,dannydc-07666,Review 08 - Insidious,8,8 March 2018,"Insidious is about a normal family that have just moved into a new area. A few weeks later tragedy arises beyond the family as Reenae and Josh's son Dalton falls off a ladder; ending up in a coma. Since that incident, the family have been experiencing horrific and terrifying monsters, aiming to cause pain on the family. After hiring a group of professionals, we actually find out that Dalton was never been in a coma. His physical body has remained on Earth, but his mental body has been taken over by the monsters, and it trapped in a place known as the ""Further"". We also find out that Josh has also been in the same situation, as he has been dreaming of a creepy woman dressed in black.This movie is scary. I need to point that out now. The director has done an amazing job on making this movie terrifying. I struggled to go around my own home at night with the thoughts of the monsters in my mind! The music and the jump scares are also fantastic.All of the actors do a fantastic job of portraying their characters. But the star of the film for me is Lin Shaye. Her character is by far the most likeable throughout the whole movie. But everyone does a great job! This movie is one of my favourite horrors of all time. Its the only one i have seen in the series so i can't wait to review the next 3. I recommend this movie to all horror fans, as you will be creeped out!",Insidious
462,callumbainbridge,The Worst Movie I've Ever Seen,1,16 September 2013,"Now I'm not saying it's the worst movie hands down but many movies that are worse than this one don't receive as much attention and almost realise themselves how awful they are, Insidious fails to do this and the fact that it completely mocks the horror movie genre as a whole lands it as the worst movie that humanity has ever spawned.So let's look at what happens: nobody dies, nobody is really particularly injured, there's a single instance of blood from a handprint that is neither that of the child nor that of the demon, there is some random system of underworlds that is designed solely for this movie that neither makes sense nor is particularly original, half way through these two guys come in who are ghost detectors and they're pretty much a comedy duo, throughout much of the movie the woman is the main character but then at the end for no reason in particular the man takes centre stage after having been barely in it to turn the movie into an action movie, the final showdown being a fist fight (Yes, A FIST FIGHT) with the demon, who apparently wants to cause mass destruction but can't beat a guy who works out too much at fisticuffs. It wasn't scary, it wasn't believable, it wasn't interesting, it was a constant parody of itself and I couldn't help but feel a little bit awful after I had watched it. Seriously, please, please don't buy this movie.",Insidious

Swirling violin music. A devil with a red face? Dolls and puppets. An old record player playing an old song. Cue old lady medium and ghostbuster sidekicks with ridiculous gadgets. Seriously? I love good horror films and this isn't one of them. Think of something original please. I have had to say that there are spoilers in here but the things I mention already spoil the movie.

And though, technically, it's not the houses that are haunted, this film has all the makings of a good haunted house flick. Before the coma tragedy and the hauntings that follow, the family goes through the normal concerns of adjusting to a new home. Isn't this how many haunted house films begin? Insidious certainly has the haunted house props. The first house has a tall staircase and a spooky attic. The second has a long hallway with a grandfather clock at the hallway's end that sort of stands in an eerie spotlight. There are plenty of places for ghostly beings to hide. Creating such hiding places in suburban homes seems to be one of Director James Wan's specialties. For a more thorough review, check out my wordpress blog. The link is on my profile page.",Insidious
468,gilmoregirls47,"Insidious... Just the name shows this movie, is not one to see",3,7 April 2011,"The ""thriller"" Insidious is not what it seemed like it would be at all, not scary, so-so storyline, and horrible graphics filling the parts that ran out of plot. As scary parts came along, the giggles became plentiful as graphics, music, setting, and acting were all horribly entertaining and not set up the way they should have been. After moving into a new house, a young family's son unexpectedly falls into a coma and tests are done with results that are all but helpful, just after the tragic accident, the family learns that their new abode is 'haunted' or so they think. In the end of several happenings that throw the husband and wife into a crazy state, they finally decide to move to a new, not 'haunted' home. While unpacking the wife undergoes yet again, another happening with a ghost that throws her into turmoil and confusion, pushing the family to greater heights and forcing them into the Ghostbuster yellow pages.After the experts check out the home, they decide that they immediately need to put a plan into action in order to save the sons live, whom is not haunted by the house, but by his dreams. Usually, a film has a least one great trait, this one does not- the filming is way off for what it should be, the acting is not in character, and the plot makes no sense and sparks no attention what so ever. For a credit, the makers went in the right direction for an actual thriller that makes you jump, but ruined it with all else included in the movie. Obviously, I found this movie as one of the worst I have ever seen, scary movies are not supposed to make you laugh throughout them, this ends with a harsh score of 4 out of 10.",Insidious
469,danneman_857,Overrated movie of the year,5,29 May 2011,"As a big horror fan, I was really looking forward to this movie. Watched it at the night in the cinema. So, a perfect scenario - A new horror movie, at night , at the big screen! Well it was not what I expected. The first hour was quite okay, and I was looking forward to the finale that seemed to be really good! But the last 30 minutes.. Seriously? It was just a major letdown! Maybe it was because my expectations was skyhigh, but it doesn't matter, either way I cant just ignore the fact that it was just plain bad. My friend beside me said after an hour that the movie became more and more complex and just absurd. The plot was just too overkill, and the movie did not live up to anything at all. It was not entirely bad, but compare this to Paranormal Activity which I found great is just pathetic! Insidious had one scene in the entire movie that was a bit scary, but since i've already seen it in the official trailer.. Yeah you get it. The monster in the film was pathetic, it looked like a five-year old put it together in paint. Is that the best you can do with all your computers in 2011? I've seen better looking film-monsters 1970. As a summary: 1. Not too bad acting, but the storyline just fades away and becomes more and more absurd. 2. Smocked with b-horror movie clichés, like hands in drawers, clowns, ugly monsters you name it.3. Worth watching if you're really bored, but I don't recommend it! :)5/10 .

470,DMan_76,So Close,8,19 February 2013,"***Contains Spoilers*** OK! So I am assuming the readers of this rant have some interest in horror flicks or why else would you be researching this movie. Well let me say that this one was on the verge of greatness. Let me explain. You know how most of the so called scary movies out there are either to corny like 'Zombie Strippers!' or so slow and drawn out that you want to eat your own arm off before any action occurs like 'Paranormal Activity'. You won't have that problem in this film. The reason I say ""Was on the verge of greatness"" has nothing to do with the acting or script itself but with the makeup malfunction. You see right in the middle of the movie when this film is scaring most people senseless, imagine my surprise when Darth Maul (Phantom Menace) appears as the demon. I mean there are some subtle differences but come on, its Darth Maul. This was such a great movie and I encourage any horror fan to watch it. I just think that they could have made a better demon.

471,ciccarellib,Falls flat,6,6 August 2012,"Some things in this movie were so well done. The ghosts at times could be very terrifying not just in making the viewer jump, but also just scary to look at. The main characters are really well developed and all have their own personality. Unfortunately, the plot bores the viewer to death in the second half. I was incredibly disappointed in the direction this movie took and I felt like from second half on I really had no interest but for the movie to end. It's a shame, because the first half really had some scary moments and it was gradually scarier and scarier. What I enjoyed about the scary scenes was that I felt as if they had more substance than most movies. They were not the enjoyable but cheap thrills of the Paranormal Activity series but rather strong visually and psychologically. Though I will never understand why the movie took a turn for the worse, I do think the movie is still worth seeing and it is perhaps someone else's cup of tea more than it is mine.",Insidious
472,acidictrip,Good movie. DO NOT miss the end!,8,9 January 2013,"*This review may contain SPOILERS*. Personally, I find supernatural horror to be the creepiest of all the sub genres of horror, because it is something that we don't know how to handle (if at all it exists). In that sense, 'Insidious' is as scary as it can get without being too gory or visually unappealing. Director James Wan proves that you don't need tons of scary makeup and mutilated or bloody or zombie-like people to give a fright. Sure, there is some makeup used for frightening effects, but the scary-looking people, in addition to the tight story, make for a good scare. The haunted family with the apparitions and scary faces popping out from every corner of the house, the husband (Josh, played by Patrick Wilson) not believing the wife (Renai, played by Rose Byrnes)when she tells him about the apparitions, thinking she's imagining things, yet eventually being forced to move to another house because the wife can't seem to control herself, the son (Dalton, played by Ty Simpkins) unconscious and doctors unable to explain the 'coma' he is in, are all routine ingredients of a horror flick. That's as routine as it gets. Enter Elise Rainier (Lin Shaye) and her team of paranormal investigators, and the story becomes gripping. Initially dismissive of Elise's observations, Josh eventually relents when he tallies some of his son's drawings with Elise's findings. What follows is even more thrilling as Josh's past is revealed and he tries to save his son. But like with every good narrative, the best part is at the end. DO NOT miss the end! Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne do a good job as the parents, but I felt that Byrne needed a little polishing of her acting skills (not that it handicapped the movie in any way, though). (Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne look good together.It would be interesting to watch them in a romcom.)Lin Shaye gives a very strong and highly laudable performance. She clearly has the responsibility of the movie on her shoulders and does complete justice to her role. Ty Simpkins surprises you when he is not sleeping (which he does for half of his screen time) with his acting. There is also a touch of humour the director tries to provide with Elise's teammates as they try to get one up over the other. The writing is tight and keeps you hanging for more. The cinematography is almost perfect, the sound effects and music add to the spooky aura of the film. With the supernatural genre, the writing sometimes tends to go awry and writers end up with more twists than they had initially intended for. Writer Leigh Whannell sticks to one theory and pretty much keeps the story linear and free of messy twists and turns. All in all, 'Insidious' is a good scare if you are a horror fan. It's definitely worth your money.",Insidious
473,lcri-1,A Huge Disappointment,4,9 April 2011,"Insidious confuses me. Not because of the plot, which is endlessly spelled out by exposition-spewing secondary characters and is all shamelessly lifted from better movies anyway. I'm confused as to how so many people like it. A 7.4 on the IMDb, a ""Fresh"" rating on Rotten Tomatoes, and people proclaiming it's the scariest thing they've ever seen... has everyone been taking drugs? Have they forgotten all other horror movies exist? I know I'm not alone in this. Everyone in the theater with me disliked the film. Four girls walked out partway through, people were laughing at the ""scary"" bits and cracking jokes, and when the credits started rolling, I loudly proclaimed, ""Well, that sucked."" The crowd laughed in agreement. So what happened? Was my theater somehow screening a different cut of the movie? Is everyone else living in an alternate dimension where this is a good movie? I have no idea.Now onto the plot. A family has just moved into a big, creepy old house. One of the kids falls into a supernatural coma, because his spirit is trapped in the realm of the dead, and the mother starts seeing visions of ghosts. The dad is skeptical at first, but eventually cannot deny the truth. They move, but it's the person who's haunted - actually stalked by a demon trying to possess him - and not the house. They call in an old lady and her goofy team of supernatural tech experts to bring the kid's soul back into the real world. What's that, you say? It sounds exactly like a sloppy cross between Poltergeist and Paranormal Activity? Well, yes, that's because it is.Nothing happens in this movie that isn't incredibly predictable. That might be okay if it were done better than most other movies, but it isn't - the apparitions are often more goofy than scary, there's too much comedic relief, dialogue is simplistic and far too expository, and the acting never rises above mediocre (and is usually somewhat short of that mark).Near the beginning of the film, it's shown that family life is tense. The parents have three kids, and the father, a schoolteacher, has been staying at work late every night with flimsy excuses. That plot point is mentioned once or twice, then completely abandoned. The two kids who still have souls in their bodies, a baby girl and young boy, almost completely disappear from the movie at the halfway point and never amount to anything. We learn that our female lead is a songwriter near the beginning, which is really the only characterization we get, and also goes nowhere other than the standard ""mysteriously moved object"" scene with some of her sheet music. In fact, the entire film is almost completely devoid of character development.There are some plot points that carry over, but this is actually another problem. The movie thinks it's much more clever than it actually is, and also assumes the audience is full of idiots. It uses the tried-and-true device of kids drawing out their nightmares, and almost every single time we see what inspired the drawing, the movie cuts back to that picture in case we forgot about it already.There's also a subplot involving a previous possession attempt on another character by a different spirit, which is clumsily introduced with more over-expository dialogue and of course leads into the telegraphed ""twist"" ending. This subplot also makes heavy use of the ""spirit photography"" element, and feels a lot like Shutter or parts of The Omen.There's even a trek into the otherworld in which a character is sidetracked from his goal when he discovers the origin of two smiling, murdered female ghosts who have no real relevance to the plot other than to serve as a sloppy and unnecessary allusion to The Shining. It's implied they may have been killed in the house that the family moved into at the beginning of the film, but this is not at all important to any occurrence in the movie's story.These girl ghosts are joined by two other standard ghost types who are highlighted amongst all the inhabitants of the netherworld for no apparent reason: the creepy guy with a disgustingly malformed tongue and mouth who is required to attempt kissing a character at some point, and the playful, annoying, goofy and unscary little kid spirit who's obligated to play ""hide and seek"" with a victim.Occasionally, something scary will happen - a few scenes build reasonable suspense and there are several cheap jumps, but these don't override the failings of the film as a whole.Maybe people liked it simply because it reminded them of some of their favorite older horror movies. I'm of the mind that references don't work unless the movie they're in is good on its own, and I didn't find this to be a good movie. It wasn't even bad enough to be fun - just 103 minutes of generic, disappointing, and uninspired horror tropes. I suppose I'm happy for all the people who like it; I certainly wish I'd enjoyed it as much as they did. But I can't say I see the value in this movie. I didn't think it was OFFENSIVELY bad, so perhaps you should take a chance on it since so many others think it's great. Just don't be surprised if you walk away feeling like you wasted your time.",Insidious

There are all those elements that you're used to see in such films: the new home, the careless children, the over-busied wife, the distant and clueless husband, the easy scare jumps, the obvious ""external help"", the ghosts, the sequel-friendly ending...When you have watched a ""Polstergeist"" movie, you've seen them all.

I watched this movie the first time in 9th grade I believe. It was in our classroom and we turned the lights off and it was awesome feeling. You know I just realized what makes things scarier...when people around you are scared. When people around you are screaming and hugging each other it puts more of a fear into you or (me).

478,zaferzipzip,"Scary but, not that scary",6,25 June 2011,"I think the first half was very promising and scarier than the second half. Since first 40 - 50 minutes of the movie is built upon horror movie tradition, ,and working great in the sense of horror genre (haunted house, possessed little boy, etc ). Unfortunately director destroys the first half in the second half, simply taking an unorthodox approach to the genre. Basically what he did was he turned horror icons upside down, for example he tried to scare audience with shots taking place in almost sunny daytime ,or he used a group of characters even in the most scary moments rather than one helpless character. The problem here is when you see daylight or a bunch of people screaming around you don t get scared because you fell safe. When you fell safe while watching a horror movie, you don t attach yourself to the characters and fell any empathy for them. Also the technological stuff that the characters used to bridge between our physical world and nonphysical world wasn't exactly working as it was supposed to , in fact i believe many people find it funny, maybe the director actually used it to ridicule the genre he played with. Anyway I'd say, the movie is OK, it sometimes scared me sometimes I found it very funny (evil make-up was Ridiculous). I think, the director deliberately mixed horror icons with unusual elements to surprise the audience more ,but I don't know why he wanted some funny stuff in his movie. I'd recommend this movie to horror fans who look for something different, but i can't say i myself enjoyed much.",Insidious

480,whitebricks,Very bad Poltergeist Rip Off,5,23 April 2011,"I only decided to watch this movie because I like scary movies and IMDb had good reviews on this. What a mistake!!! This movie started off OK - Decent until the cheap rip off of ghost hunters entered the picture then the movie lost all credibility, eg: A distressed family is sharing their horror experience with the ghost hunters in their first interview as one of them is eating what looks like a burrito or wrap, attempting to add some humor or comedy into the picture. The rip off of (Tangina) from Poltergeist was also seen, anyone who has seen the movie Poltergeist will totally see right through this sad attempt. The movie from this point just went on being ridiculous and not scary at all.I should have known better, ""Paranormal Activity and SAW"" should tell you enough save your money rent it!",Insidious
481,elfnik,Very best horror movie so far!,10,4 May 2011,"WOW What a great movie. I am horror fan, i have seen so many movies in my life. Every movie i watched by now wasn't even close to this one.This is masterpiece of horror movie, it has all the elements that one movie need to have. Just perfect.The best thing is that from start you gonna think that its something similar to any other horror movie, but as the story goes, more and more you realize that it is so great.It keeps you attention to the end, its not boring at all, not for a minute.Simply, this one you must watch, especially if you are horror movie fan!",Insidious
482,movieman1947,Surprisingly Good and Intense,7,2 April 2011,"The film Insidious has done something many horror movies have failed to do recently, and that is to be scary. Insidious has a lot of really intense moments that scare, and then grab hold of you. Its not entirely made up of ""make you jump"" scenes, which it does have, but scenes with genuine horror. Insidious has taken a risk with doing something original, and It works here for them. Without giving anything away the movie does not just talk about whats scary, or show the the aftermath of something going on in a room that you can only hear until its over and the door magically unlocks. Insidious shows you whats scary, and quite often reminds you whats there, and waiting in the dark.",Insidious

If you're afraid of scary old women and little girls in horror films, I'd love to see your reaction after you see this. The acting is also pretty good, considering there are little known stars in this.I saw this about two weeks ago and still find it hard to sleep now! Some of the scenes are not only scary, but disturbing, particularly the end scene....All in all, if you want a good scare and unsettling sleeps, watch this.... you won't regret it.",Insidious

I watch it because it's so well done. Exhausting as it is, it just do a what it was made to do.

486,scatter_brained4,Watched it completely alone in a theater room with... still left me feeling like I got ripped off,3,9 May 2011,"Okay first of all, I was expecting to be scared out of my wits. The beginning left me wanting to leave the theater because the music was so loud and creepy especially because I was at a matinée and no one was there except me. The movie drags for so long. Some scenes feel like Paranormal Activity. Realistic and boring... just waiting for the good parts. I felt as if I was in a cheap haunted house during Halloween. I thought the point of this movie was for the child to be evil and do crazy stuff, but that only happens occasionally and he is completely zombiefied. I would've given this movie 1 star, but there were some scenes I particularly liked. For instance, the scene of the insane family in The Further towards the end and the scene where the little boy's tormentor is up in his crazy room with his machines and clocks... The plot of the story is plain boring. The lines were so dreadful and the actors I just felt like punching in the face especially the father. The only decent and interesting character was the old women who came to help and the other little brother. Everyone else seemed tired and uninterested almost as much as I was. I was falling asleep and forcing myself to watch until the last 20 minutes came in. After that, the mood I got from it was bad. This movie is so cheesy, and I had no trouble sleeping. If you want to watch something scary just pop in The Exorcist.",Insidious
487,Rowley9050,A Phenomenal New Horror Film!,9,22 October 2011,"I've been hearing praise towards this movie all year long, and since this October 2011 has been a rather stale Halloween season for newly released horror films, I decided it was time to see Insidious for myself. I'm glad I finally did. Insidious is a phenomenal new horror film that starts off as an all too familiar haunted house tale, but then quickly takes the viewer on a very creative and unique journey. The cinematography is brilliant; full of dark narrow hallways with clocks, winding staircases, and shadows lurking in the corner. The sound effects are spine tingling and the eerie violin shrieks and mellow gongs from the musical score perfectly set the mood. The acting is also very good for a horror film.A quick plot summary; Insidious is about a young family who moves into a creepy old house. An incident in the attic causes their eldest son to fall dormant in a coma-like state. Strange occurrences and hauntings begin to take place forcing the family to leave and move into a new home where the hauntings continue to happen. A psychic reveals to them that their son is the cause and that ghosts and demons are trying to get into his body to bring pain towards others.Now I must admit, Insidious did not scare me as much as I thought it would, but it certainly has some very creepy moments and is up there with some of the scarier movies I've seen in my life. For one that red demonic creature is terrifying! - especially the first time it appears, in broad daylight behind the grandmother who is describing her dream. Nowhere is safe now. I wasn't expecting it at all, and the special effects team did a frighteningly good job on its features; hoofs and all! That's when I realized that this horror film was for real; the rest of the film left me tensed and waiting for that thing to appear again. I should mention that one of its later appearances was a very cool scene that reminded me of Freddy from Nightmare on Elm Street, the demon is sharpening it's claws in a chilling red sanctuary.Aside from that the atmosphere of both the houses creates very uneasy environments and works well in the film. The séance scene was really adrenaline inducing as well and is a great example of how well this film worked to create fear without being overly gory and violent. In this scene one of the paranormal investigators is writing really disgusting things on paper that the demon is apparently saying; this allows the viewer's imagination to run rampant. Another notable part of this movie is the hellish journey the father must take at the end in order to save his son. This mind-bending quest allowed the filmmakers the freedom to do anything in order to make sure we (the viewers) would not sleep at night. It also breaks the rules of reality putting the viewer even more on edge to the fact that he/she has no idea what to expect anymore. This was brilliant story writing and filmmaking! For all the praise I have given Insidious, I took some points off primarily because some of the plot line was pretty far-out there. The fact that the kid has the gift to allow his spirit to travel out of this world when he sleeps was slightly vague; can that kid ever sleep sound again? Also the ending, although it was a good twist, could have been a bit better. I still don't really know how the father and creepy demon lady got switched around or what really was going on as they were facing each other down at the climax. So a couple vague plot elements, but overall they can be easily overlooked to allow for an enjoyable film experience.In conclusion, Insidious is a spectacular new horror movie that stands out from many of the rest. I'm excited to say that James Wan is finally beginning to establish himself as one of the great new horror directors of film having done Insidious, Dead Silence, and of course Saw.",Insidious
488,Henbaine,Started out so promising- sadly fell flat : (,7,11 May 2013,"The premise is pretty good. Although it put me in mind of ""Poltergeist"" with the whole having to go to another ""World"" to save someone, or the classic part of Amityville 8 with the final attic scene. This was a very promising storyline, however it tries so hard to be realistic from the off then trails off into fantasy land. *sigh* I really felt for the characters originally, struggling with their young son who suddenly one day after a fall is in a ""coma"" Cue distraught mother and absent, working late, aggro father refusing to believe that the house is haunted after weird things suddenly start to happen.. before finding irrefutable ""evidence"" ( who does not look at their kid's wall and see drawings when trying to find out what has happened to them??? they spend a good deal of time in his bedroom but never spot a MASSIVE clue??) Some scenes genuinely had me freaked.. the shoes and the little boy, Dalton ""walking around"" while in a coma was very eerie. The creepy guy stood by him pointing. The house in the ""further"" with the very odd family. But the main ""demon"" well, not so much. Didn't even look scary- a pierced darth maul- esque face with blue eyes,the classic cloven hooves under furry legs and razor sharp teeth showing hints of a forked tongue.Hmmm, sure. It was at the point where he is filing his claws on a sander surrounded by puppets in some phantom of the opera worthy setting that I felt the movie had lost it's way slightly. Also the whole,creepy psychic woman- who knows more than she lets on.. mother's prophetic/flashback dream and of course, the token over exuberant paranormal investigators made me think ""tired clichés!"" but they did manage to make some scenes more realistic in this attempt at least...So, a few too many clichés and cookie cutter horror scenarios later( the hey I'm a psychic- something's up with your house- you know that cause I pause mid sentence and give ""that look"" but dismiss it.. so..""let's look round here-oh!yep a ghost-Let's break it to the family. Person X: not I refuse to get help! you are full of it.. oh no, wait, my bad..the house is falling apart : / OK maybe we should do this.. let's call a spirit/ astral body..ooh geez that escalated quickly it's gone wrong and spirits are attacking us.. let's go to the other world to save someone and follow someone's voice back.. *pauses for air..*) The one saving grace *drum roll* -twist at the end! hurray! And yes, ever the hard to please viewer..I humbly admit- I didn't see this coming! (or fully grasp it) Pretty open to interpretation- and now I see why-sequel! Good call.so now I am actually looking forward to seeing things unravel further in Insidious 2.. let's hope it can redeem some of it's flaws!",Insidious
489,mush_disaster,"Good plot, interesting development, disappointing ending",7,25 September 2013,"While I found the plot interesting, the scare-factor was a big disappointment. Without the sound effects, the movie wouldn't have been at all scary. Maybe a little thrilling, but not scary. The demon looked like a well-made Halloween costume; the doll-faced ghosts weren't even a little bit realistic (and don't look like they could have been people once upon a time) and the ending was nothing but predictable.I did enjoy the plot though, and also the actors (everyone but the boy). There were no terrible special effects (which is a big plus in my book). I found the plot development refreshing (this time the characters actually moved out when they got scared, contrary to most other characters in most other movies who very frustratingly stick around until they get themselves killed).But long before the end I already knew what was about to happen and to whom. Sadly, I find most horror-movie endings disappointing and this one was no exception. It would have been so much more refreshing if things had gone well, if there had been a happy ending!",Insidious
490,fernie121793,Spooky Good Fun,9,7 December 2014,The first time I watched it I couldn't sleep at night. Sure this movie is unoriginal which is unfair because of similarities of other movies with similar plots but this movie is unique of its own. The cast were great and the atmosphere was just creepy for me. The lipstick demon was scary in the dark but later on it wasn't so much the movie was a fun paranormal thriller. I love how they attempted to satirized the haunted house theme with a psychic and spooky children. There's definitely a few jump scares either by just the music (which worked on me) or the ghosts themselves that play a haunting image in your head when you're about to sleep.,Insidious
491,balsac44,nailed it perfectly,10,2 May 2011,"For what this movie is, it is a perfect movie. Anyone who would say this is not a good entertaining horror film is operating on a personal agenda. The bottom line is go see this movie so the filmmakers can make more movies like this for the people like me who love them. Everyone else steer completely clear of the entire production and any like it please. For it be you who want our thrill rides to disappear and be lost forever only to make more room for the countless bloated over budgeted, Real D and CGI infested crapfests that survive only because fat suits have billions to burn on marketing and promotion. It is the little engine that could (scare the bejees out of you) that will be profit by word of mouth at the box office and long after in rental and DVD sales. So please if you heart these horror films as I do go see this one on the big screen and get those goosebumps like never before to stand at attention until laying to rest fully satisfied that films like this will never die, just their critics.Now here is why we love it...Insidious is an absolutely horrifying film. A sledgehammer to you senses and a tattoo you will not easily remove anytime soon on your nerves. I want to see it again RIGHT NOW. I want to own it, so I can look into madness on pause and view nightmarish fiends violently attacking innocent human beings in slow motion. This movie is a dance with something unimaginable but the same time made seemingly possible. A beautiful family is at the mercy of a malevolent crew of demons and it does not matter how or why but they must wage war to survive and what a fantastic battle it is. The bumbling stumbling ghost tracker crew must not only explain, discover, and draw out the adversary but also defend itself against it and folks the good guys do not always win anymore in these great low budget freakshows that offer absolutely no apologies.You will get no blood, not one drop. What you will get is uneasy and restless from the eerie sounds of footsteps, whispers, creaking doors banging piano keys and ear piercing violin strings set to shadowy walk bys that happen so fast you will leap from your seat so high you may think you have entered an Astral Plain yourself. So prepare yourself and get a good grip because unlike the moron that sat behind talking and giggling YOU will keep your eyes wide open, your mouth closed YOU will not be disappointed in what you see.",Insidious
492,DreamScapeSev7n,Pretty Average Horror Film,5,23 January 2019,"Maybe it's because I find supernatural stuff less intriguing as a non-believer in ghosts and demons, or maybe it's because I've seen a lot of the stuff in this movie done before, is why I didn't like this movie. I think personally it's both. Though this movie does have some cool sequences and interesting creature designs, it just doesn't save it from the mediocre plot",Insidious
493,remaxmiracle,...good heavens was this bad,3,28 January 2012,"Sorry to say it, but this entire movie was an experiment in how to jump the shark, or nuke the fridge or whatever you want to call it. I am so glad I did not pay to see this in a theater. I would have asked for my money back after walking out half an hour in. With elements from other, better movies you'd hope this would have been more interesting - but no amount of ripping off from Poltergeist can save it. Every single character was wooden and uninteresting and I had no desire to see any of them live through the movie. Not one. Not even the kids. The so called suspense wasn't suspenseful. The plot was so thin and predictable I am surprised M. Night what's his name didn't write it. At one point I looked at my husband and said ""for crying out loud..did they really just go there?"". A total face palm moment. I really really love a good haunted house/haunted kid/something evil under the bed type movie. This wasn't it.",Insidious
494,YesterdayTommorow,Somewhat slow at the beginning but solid end,7,12 June 2019,"The build up to when everything goes down is a bit slow but I think necessary in amplifying the emotions you feel in the last sequences. There are jump scares though what I found to be most terrifying is the imagery - imagery being one of the motifs of the story as well, initially using drawings and photographs and then to dreams.The music feels a bit cheesy but works and it was a fun movie with solid composition.",Insidious
495,zippelflorian,An average horror movie - could've been much better tho!,6,14 November 2020,"Depends on whether people find this movie scary or not, there are very polarized reviews rating it either 1/10 or 10/10. Neither is describing this movie accuratley.I found it to be a quite average horror movie, not bad - not excatly good either. It delivers a promising start and actually left me quite scared round a'bout the half of the movie.Then the same mistaktes occure that much of the genre is haunted by: overexplaining. No, sorry, you can legitimately explain the existence of different types of ghosts and an Outer world. Once the Ghost Busters arrived, I started laughing out loud - suddenly nothing about this movie was scary anymore. Why do horror movies feel this need to add a bad, unnesscary story line and pseudo-scentific explanations for impossible things?Conisidering that the acting actually wasn't too bad and the effects and jump-scares were actually well-made, it is still overall not just your usual cringe-worthy horror-comedy movie. However, a different approach to the second half of the movie and this could've been actually a great horror movie.",Insidious

Plot is good, characters are well developed and they make sure to keep the thrill intact till the end. What more can we ask for? Definitely worth a watch.",Insidious
497,Tarjanian,Stongs start but falls apart a bit at the end,5,24 November 2012,"I sat alone in the dark watching Insidious and came out with somewhat mixed feelings.The set up was good and the initial build up and tension as the story slowly unfolds with good atmosphere and some good jumps that allow you to overlook some flat acting and clumsily written dialogue.I won't comment to much about the plot so as to avoid ruining it for those interested in seeing it but, I will say it's nothing ground breaking and for those that are familiar with the more suspenseful style of horror.The main issue I have with Insidious is the last quarter or so of the movie, it does a really good job of raising the tension and then loses it all for the final act.The whole feeling of the movie changes and the atmosphere is lost to the point that anything that is supposed to be scary isn't and feels like it's just relying on cheap jump scares and the plot loses it too and falls into a couple of very poorly executed twists (one which isn't obvious but is rubbish story wise and the other you'll see coming a mile away and groan about afterwards)In summery, would recommend the first three quarters of the movie, it'd probably be fun to watch if you have a really jumpy friend or something like that but don't expect it to floor you or anything.",Insidious
498,daugaard4-1,Great... yet bad.,6,16 November 2013,"When horror films decide to get into the ""other side"" discussion, they need to be very careful. I've enjoyed films such Sinister and Shutter, because they let spirits be spirits, and don't try to explain the unexplainable. I know many of you liked the fact that Insidious moves us closer to the unknown by trying to visualize the ""other side"", but to me it backfired. I do however see the idea and vision, and I think the reason why it's been positively reviewed is because of exactly that, so credit should go to Wan. If Insidious should have been successful in its attempt there should have been a waaay more scary monster (than Darth Maul), a stronger build up (the viewer should have asked him/herself more questions regarding the plot, before it was all spilled to us in a 3 minute monologue) and there should have been stronger acting performances. There is still one horror movie above anyone else (A tale of two sisters) and Insidious does not change that. It is however a refreshing attempt, with its moments, hence 6 out of 10.",Insidious
499,wellsland,Completely exceeded my expectations!,10,19 January 2014,"Wow, I just finished watching Insidious and my mind is blown. The movie was simply awesome! From the story and writing to the acting and surprise ending, Insidious delivers on all accounts. This isn't your typical haunted house ghost story, instead it's something new and unique that even the most seasoned horror veterans should be able to enjoy! I found the film to be well balanced between storytelling and horror elements. Additionally, the pacing was just right for me. Plenty of thrills and chills within, though don't expect a brutal slasher filled with gore. Instead you will find a thoughtfully crafted ghost horror thriller that is sure to please. Watch it... now!",Insidious
500,tomlawless3,"Entertaining, jumpy, funny, well made; but it just isn't scary!",7,3 May 2011,"After seeing the trailer I must admit I found myself excited and looking forward to seeing this film. Unfortunately, the trailer is just about as scary as the film gets. That aside, it is a very well made film and I found it hugely entertaining.The story itself is decent enough; haunted house, different realms, possessed child. It borrows a lot from other films but still manages to stand out as original, which I really like. I'll avoid explaining the story here as there is a synopsis for that.The whole pretence of the story is that the child is lost and may become possessed by an evil demon, who I will come to in a second. That in itself creates a race against time scenario with lots of freaky characters and many excellent opportunities for jumps and scares; which this film capitalises on at every possible occasion. Unfortunately, that is the only horror in the film: jumps and scares. Refreshingly, there is no gore and, surprisingly, there is no actual possession of the child. That is something that is totally over done in modern horror films. Mark Kermode talks excellently about paedophobia (he actually wrote a thesis largely about the subject) and that is something very prominent in this film. You only have to look at the poster to see that, even though the scares don't actually come from the boy himself, the whole notion of a possessed child seems to put the wind up us and has scared the hell out of us since The Exorcist and even before that.Instead, the film creates a wonderfully refreshing character that is a sort of medley of lots of others, which is homage to the overall thread of the film. The film itself borrows lots from other classic horror films. It owes massive debts to Poltergeist (the quirky seer, the use of technology for tracking ghosts, comedy between characters, etc) and it takes other elements from previous films, such as The Hole and Paranormal Activity. The ""demon"" itself, in my opinion, is a medley of Jeepers Creepers and Freddy Krueger. The ""demon""s ""lair"" very much reminded me of Freddy's in Wes Craven's New Nightmare, as did his metal claws and hideous appearance. The Jeepers Creepers homage is in the use of Tiny Tim's ""Tip Toe Through The Tulips"" throughout the film, as a sort of trademark or sound-piece signalling the presence of the demon. There is a particularly chilling scene that uses that song where the demon is sharpening his claws, which was excellently done, if a little silly! I also really think that the film makers should have focused a lot more on the demon. It's good to introduce the other characters that wanted to possess the boy's body, but sticking to just one character and developing him would have greatly improved the film. In comparison, imagine if A Nightmare On Elm Street featured four or five different characters all haunting their dreams. It just wouldn't have been as good and would have diluted the horror of the film. I feel that this has happened here, which is a great shame as the demon himself is pretty scary!The last third of the film does, admittedly, get quite silly as the protagonist is travelling through ""The Further"" to find his son and there are hundreds of ghosts and ghoulies breaking into our ""realm"". More ""Casper"" than ""The Exorcist"". It's all jumpy and funny but, ultimately, it just isn't very scary. Also, the film seems to end rather quickly and runs out of steam rather than completes itself. There are questions (why did they throw in the old woman character so quickly at the end? What happened with the demon in the boy's room?) rather than answers to conclude the film, which leaves a disappointment post viewing where there should be terror.The film overall lacks something to make it genuinely scary, and that is menace. In Paranormal Activity, while not overtly scary, there was a presence of menace that provided genuine terror and an overall seriousness to the film. Insidious lacks that overall feel with its use of computer graphics, the inclusion of (very funny, it must be said) comedy and its over reliance on jumps to compensate for the lack of horror.Insidious is an entertaining riot of a film and it contains some wonderful set pieces, a gripping plot; brilliant homages to some classic horror films; a decent script and solid (if unremarkable) performances from its cast. But, as a horror film, it just doesn't stand up as scary. However, when you consider that it had a smaller budget than the first Saw movie it really is an achievement. One thing I loved about this film is that it avoided the use of gore and instead compensated with the use of jumps, which is far more skillful, respectable and enjoyable than a boring bloodbath. It also managed to be wonderfully entertaining, so it must be said that Insidious is a good film that is well worth a watch. Although it relies heavily on influence from other superior horror films, it pays homage to them rather than outright ripping them off, allowing it to stand alone as a brilliant modern horror. Insidious achieves something that, while not exactly what I think it intended to, still achieved something, which is more than can be said for most low budget horror films of recent times. Hats off once again to James Wan...",Insidious
501,markandyanni,"'scuse me, your boy is haunted",8,25 November 2011,"He: From the beginning, the movie does a great job pulling out all the scary sound effects clichés. For me, the bit that had me on edge the most was the crying baby. That would make even the hardest criminal crack. Though there were some good scary flashes, I could stand to see more of the scary guy a bit and was a bit disappointed that no one died in the movie. Sorry, the psychic woman doesn't count as a human being. Oh, and by the way, once you mention astral projection, I'm thinking less about horror and more about a D&D campaign where I'm rolling a D-20 die to winnnnn! She: I like movie on the whole. It's unexpecting! I did not expect they would move to another house. I thought that the house was haunted. The mother is beautiful, the father is cute, but I don't understand the ghost. Random ghosts, like, appearing from nowhere, and especially the demon. Why the demon? That is not related to a ghost story whatsoever. But then again it kinda makes sense in the end. In the end it gave me a kinda a creep.Kaiguo: OK movie but nothing new. Kind of projection of several other movies I've seen before. Babies crying, doors creaking, know what I mean?",Insidious

I've tried looking around and I've heard good things about this movie. Too bad it was a great disappointment. I have not found any real inspiration in the story and direction, flat acting, etc ... The previous time I have tried something similar I have found ""The Myst"", that is a great horror movie! Of course there are also good aspects, the photography, some scary characters and yes in some parts the film scares a little bit(though honestly I do not understand the comments of people terrified by this film). Let's say that the story holds up decently until a little more than halfway through the film.

So I was pleasantly surprised that it wasn't a typical slasher or ghost movie. I screamed several times and just had chill bumps thru the last half of the movie! In comparison, Paranormal Activity 2 had some chilling moments, but you pretty much knew when they were coming. This movie had LOTS of scary moments!! I loved that it wasn't gory, and it had some great 70's type horror movie scenes/music/sound effects. At the beginning of the movie, when the name of the film came up, the sound and look of the title reminded me of many old scary movies, when they relied more on sound effects than computer generated effects. It was surprising and unpredictable at times. It was not corny, either. Very refreshing for a scary movie lover!! I went with a friend that I always see scary movies with, and we both agreed that this was the scariest movie we have seen in a few years! I would definitely recommend it to anyone that loves horror/ghost movies!!!",Insidious
504,wl-casper,"Terrible, over-hyped film.",1,8 May 2011,"I went to see this film the other day and for some reason I wasn't surprised at how bad it was, considering how much people over-hype films these days.Where to start with this film?.The pacing is all over the place, the film is too slow at the start and by the end you feel like you've sat through an hour and a half of a cheap home movie.The acting is another negative point to this film.You can't connect with the characters and as a result you don't care what happens to them.There are some good things about this film if very few.The film makers try to use creep factor instead of giving the audience blood and guts and the premise of the story is decent but the end result should have been so much better.As for the scary parts, its one least scary films i've ever watched.There are a few moments that make you jump out of your seat but nothing more.People are saying this is the scariest film they've ever seen - How many films have these people watched? not many I guess. I would strongly advise people to wait for this to come out on DVD and have it for a Saturday night shock because it's not worth the money or the trip to the cinema.",Insidious
505,tstrycula1,Nothing you haven't seen before. They tried too hard to make it scary.,1,16 April 2011,"I'm sorry, but honestly, I don't get what all the hype is about! To me, this movie seems so overrated! They were trying way too hard just to scare people, that it left no room for a good story or good acting. I actually think I was laughing more than being scared while watching this movie because of the ridiculous acting. And also, does anyone agree with me when I say the music was absolutely outrageous and over the top. Thats what I meant when I said they were trying too hard to scare the audience. Without the music this movie would be totally hopeless.Not to mention they copied probably 3 to to 4 different movies. You got Poltergeist, with the kid getting lost in some other world and the dad goes in to save him. You got Dead Silence, with the smiling, doll look-a-like people. And you have all those exorcism movies with the demons and the devil thrown in there as well. Also, did anyone notice that the music was extremely similar to that of The Exorcist? Total copycat movie.You get nothing new in this unoriginal and highly overrated movie. I would recommend this film to those who like cheesy teen horror flicks and like to be scared by stupid pop-out moments. To me, it was a very over-hyped movie that will probably be forgotten within the next year. I wouldn't waste my money. And if your still interested in this pathetic excuse of a horror movie, I would wait to rent it on DVD. Overall, it was a Hot Mess! Stay Away!My Rating: 0-10",Insidious
506,francis-cy,below average and not scary,4,18 September 2011,"when i watched this movie I thought I would probably have trouble sleeping tonight (mainly for the fact that I'm the biggest coward that you've ever seen) but i also thought it would be an interesting movie to watch (at least not alone) so we watched it with the lights off and for the first 30 minuets and it was alright even though it was a bit cliché. but towards the 2/3 of the movie things became cliché for the worst of reasons. the characters became even more dull than they already were and downright silly. even the usually enjoyable nerds of movies like these were poorly executed. i don't really see what was so scary about this movie. pedo women who stole my look, guy with claws and old people. the ending reminded me too much of Michael Jackson's thriller. so yeah in conclusion an overrated cheap flick which is so bad it becomes funny.",Insidious
507,sstrick500,BOO! Did I scare ya?,7,2 December 2011,"I usually don't watch so-called ""scary movies"" because, well...they aren't very scary to me. So the ""scary"" moments in this film are the typical BOO!, LOUD SOUND. Yeah I jumped. Several times.Acting was blah; especially from the husband guy. Its like they filmed his rehearsal. Pretty much emotionless...even in scenes that DEMANDED emotion. The wife and children acted fairly well though.The story flows fairly well. There's not much ""character building""..as its not really needed in this film. Some scenes leave you scratching your head afterward (""what was the point there?"" you ask yourself).As many previous reviews mention...the film starts off well, and then kinda nose-dives: not a total explosive wreck...but a crummy rough landing with some minor injuries..so-to-speak.",Insidious

509,DaveCooper,What a let down,5,30 October 2011,"Okay - creepy children scare the hell out of me. I normally avoid watching these types of films - but, hey it's Halloween so, why not. True enough, the opening 45 minutes was very tense with some great scares and strong direction from the safe hands of James Wan. Whilst not avoiding every horror cliché, Wan does well to keep the camera moving and not telegraphing the jumps. However, in my humble opinion it's the second act where it takes steep nosedive and ruins most of it's early hard work. The plot becomes pretty ludicrous and negates any fear, by being, basically dumb. Out of body flying children and demon faced wierdos aren't nearly as scary as a good old fashioned ghost boy. The father having experienced this all as a boy and being the only one who could save his son, along with the obligatory 'Twist' ending were all signposted a mile away and by the time it was finished, I wasn't even nearly scared. Just a bit bored.",Insidious
510,LizardKingBey,FINALLY a genuinely terrifying movie!!!,10,4 April 2011,"First of all, I'll try to keep this as ""spoiler free"" as possible. After the extremely eerie opening sequence, the movie's soon-to-be iconic title brutally pops on screen with some the most unnerving strings ever heard. From that moment, you know you're in for one Hell of a ride. Then we go back to ""normal"" in a very Poltergeist-esque setting: a happy family moving in to a new house, one of the children has an encounter with evil spirits and gets lost on the other side, the parents try to help their kid the best they can, they bring in mediums, of course, and the rest is history. YES, a lot of this film might appear as déjà vu, but the director knows that, and that's exactly why he, in between two terrifying and effective jump scares, winks at some of the greatest horror movies out there. Hey he even got Barbara Hershey in this movie, for Christ's sake. The cast is absolutely brilliant: Rose Byrne's talent stands out the most, but Patrick Wilson is pretty impressive, and Barbara Hershey shines as always. Lin Shaye brought in the tongue-in-cheek humour this movie much needed, both for brief moments of stress relief and for showing us that it's not taking itself too seriously (it's a horror movie, not Casablanca.) Don't take this the wrong way, humour doesn't mean lean on scares. Never in my life have I been THIS terrified while watching a film (only Stanley Kubrick's ""The Shining"" and Ti West's ""House Of The Devil"" come close to that, in my book.) It felt like a increasing nightmare from the very first shot and it never let go. At some point I was literally shaking in my seat, that says a lot, coming from me. I even screamed at one point, and I'm usually annoyed by people screaming at horror movies. But this... this was something else. It was a movie of sheer TERROR, not just horror. And don't worry, you'll actually SEE the ghosts and other entities in this one... And although I would've imagined them looking less cartoonish, they actually scared the crap out of me for some reason, so I guess their look worked after all... Anyways, see for yourself. Trust me, this is one horror movie you DO NOT want to miss in theatres. Lightning doesn't strike twice and THIS, my friends, might very well be the horror movie of the decade.",Insidious
511,envision-greater,"Should have been titled ""Look There's Something in the Background *LOUD NOISE!!*""",3,10 December 2013,"Insidious should have been titled ""Hey, Look At That Thing in the Background"" or ""Loud Music When You Least Expect It"". I don't understand how these kinds of movies keep getting advertised as terrifying, or how audiences find this and similar films (The Conjuring, Paranormal Activity, etc) frightening.Another ghost/demon/spirit/entity/monster/shadow/man in a mask haunting another family in another house with creaking doors, strange noises, people in places they shouldn't be, opened windows, lights going out, specialists being called in, specialists being scared out of their minds, a history of something malevolent in the main character's past, a handful of jump scares as things pass by the screen, and ultimately another less-than-satisfying ""scary"" movie. How do actors keep a straight face when making a movie so silly? Chances are you'll jump a few times, but that's because the filmmakers lure you in with the quiet and then throw a loud noise at you with a scary face attached. Don't waste your time with this one.",Insidious
512,keremgo,Horrible indeed...,1,10 July 2013,"Genre is horror but movie was horrible. What a load of nonsense. Worse creature designs and make-ups I've ever seen. Those ""other world"" environments suppose to be scary? I could do more scary stuff myself in my home with a box of scraps.Production design was terrible. They tried to be scary so badly, it looks funny. People with Halloween costumes coming out of closets. I actually laughed out loud when I see this. Total waste of time, worst horror movie I've ever seen.Music was also really bad. I think because the lack of production design, they tried to scare audience with the loud nonsense noises. Awful music. Personally I love horror movies with good music - like Silent Hill. Check out The Apparition for example, not a super good movie but music was great. Good music creates fine atmosphere and makes everything more catchy. This movie is also lack of that...Save your money for something else instead.",Insidious
513,Christianga76,2nd half of the film messes up the movie.,6,29 July 2013,***MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS***The first half of the film was terrifying I thought the scares were so effective and the suspense was high. The film succeeded in showing enough but not too much and the ghosts looked scary. But as the film shows more of its ghosts and demon it ruined everything the first half worked for. The demon looked awfully like dark maul from Star Wars and having it sharpen it's nails in a room full of dolls and puppets with tip toe through the tulips was so cheesy and by then I lost interest. also when it showed the ghosts more and actually had them fighting it just took the realism and scariness from the film. It just did too much for me I'm the type that likes my movies to have many scares but it can't be too much and this film just went off the rails. The conclusion was suspenseful and I knew right from the end there was going to be a sequel no matter how long they took to announce it. Hopefully it's sequel will be an extended full movie of this films first half.,Insidious
514,itssomething,Truly fantastic!,9,7 May 2017,"The classic retro horror atmosphere of this movie is superb! For me personally any horror fanatic worth his salt should know that scary often comes from great direction and production, not the ability to make blood splatter, and this is where this movie does it for me.Insidious not only has a great plot carried out by a great cast, it also has an enjoyable feel all the way through.You can be smiling one moment and wide eyed the next.A personal favourite I can watch again and again.",Insidious
515,SeaSludge840,"Underwhelming, the second half gets dumb FAST and disappoints",4,4 May 2020,"Well... I thought it was nice that they showed the demons, especially the shot in full lighting at the table. Other than that... this fell way short of expectations.Honestly, just save your time and read the below.I was interested the first half and was excited to see where it was going to go... that all ended abruptly once the ghost hunting team showed up, one of them with a hot pocket in hand. The way these two were written as overly exaggerated ghost hunting clichés just didn't feel correct to the tone of the movie, and were just so bad it really took me out of the movie at that point. One right brain, one left brained, always arguing over who was more important to the team which made them feel like bumbling amateurs or beginners, not seasoned hunters that would be needed for a case such as this. They were supposed to be comic relief, but their jokes were really bad, on the nose, obvious, lazy and confused the tone. They ruined the tension in the second half. Enter the clairvoyant type character. She was a bit over dramatic, but was much more plateable than the rest of her team. Which also made one wonder, again, why she would have herself be represented by such bumbling idiots. Regardless, shortly after she appeared, it was revealed that she knew the Dad because.... THE SAME THING HAPPENED TO HIM AS A CHILD. Wow.... What a weak reveal and twist.... Now it's painfully obvious that the father will re-learn how to astral project so that he can go do battle with demons and save his child........ So dumb! I was over the movie at this point and was not looking forward to the resolution. Cheesy and dumb, and just took it too far. The root of the evil should have been grounded in something a bit more tangible than astral projection. My problem wasn't really the astral projection, it was more the whole thing where the dad went through the same thing, but his memory was wiped, so he had to do it to save his son was just really corny and the movie really wasn't scary after that. It'd been ruined. Also, the full reveal of the main demon creature was a bit disappointing. Kind of like a hooved Darth Maul, but he really needed to be much bigger and more menacing. At LEAST taller and more akin to his Nosferatu-esque shadow that appears earlier. All in all, their other efforts with the Paranormal Activity series are much more tense, they fall apart near the end too, but the tone was certainly more even throughout those movies. Still... the scariest and most frightening films I've ever seen are foreign. American's tend to pull their punches and go for the broad appeal or movies that lend themselves to franchises and multiple sequels.",Insidious
516,jandeleeuw100,"Goosebumps, right from the beginning...",10,20 June 2011,"This movie literally gave me goosebumps all over my body, as well to my girlfriend who couldn't keep watching as she was so scared! As a matter of fact, everyone in the cinema was scared!!!Why? It already started with the credits, they were scary (with insane sound effects). For some reason I just knew it would not be an ordinary horror (from the people who brought you Paranormal Activities and Saw).The development of the story was great, starting with the procurement of an old, eery house. It kept everybody thinking it was the house who brought the unexplainable things to happen, but it was far more worse than that! The creatures in it keep popping up in my mind, even two days after seeing the movie.. The final part of the movie was the most frightening, with extraordinary confrontations of the creatures that haunt the family.Wow, I finally have hope for the horror-genre again. After seeing so many bad-horror movies these days, I finally found one that gave me goosebumps and keeps me hungry for more!Great movie, and a must see in the cinema (because of the special effects and sound effects)!",Insidious
517,CokerAmmiano,"If I could rate less than a 1, I would.",1,18 July 2011,"Initially, I set out to watch this movie because I'd heard from many, many people how scary it was, and frankly, my goal was to justify my position that they were all wussies.Well, the joke was on me.I was right, everyone I know is a chicken, this movie is not scary. But, it's also not even remotely entertaining.I had hopes I'd at least enjoy it, as I've quite enjoyed some of the previous offerings by Wan and Whannell. Now, I'm just angry at Wan and Whannell for dropping the ball so very, very badly. I suspect they owe someone money, and this is what they did to get it.Find below an enumerated list of my major complaints: 1) I know nothing is really ""new"" anymore, but this is basically nothing but Poltergeist with Astral projection. Boring.2) Astral projection? Seriously? Come on. And the Dad being able to do it too? How convenient. Not quite a Deux ex Machina, but close enough to leave a bad taste in my mouth.3) While I'm on astral projection... I realize that it's difficult to ""film"" that concept, but seriously, walking around in a house? That's the least convincing depiction of astral projection anyone has ever come up with. Seriously. Horrible. Did anyone think that was GOOD? 4) Fist fighting while astrally projecting? Come on.5) Contrary to popular belief, not all North American audiences are drooling morons, and we don't need to see things like the red door, and then him flashing back to the drawing of the red door. We didn't forget seeing the drawings guys... we made the connection. Also, again with the horse. I don't like my movies spoon fed to me, thanks.6) The demon looks like Darth Maul. The only thing scary about Darth Maul is how many people went to see that other snooze fest of a movie on the big screen, including me twice. If they'd been able to reanimate Tiny Tim as the demon to go along with his music, it would have been a lot more frightening than the demon they had.So, there were only two things I enjoyed in the entirety of the movie. Two. That's it.1) The creepy smiling people in the house. They look fun, and I'd invite them to dinner.2) I'm glad the father came back possessed. Though I was hoping it'd happen to the kid too. But hey, gotta punk out for the North American audiences, right? Can't do that to a kid. Blah.The end is the only thing that saves this from a total zero..5",Insidious

It just kept getting better and better,and when they introduced us to the further in such a believable way i got really amazed,and even more interested. This movie is very well done,James Wan really shows us that he is a master of horror.It has so many good scares,like the ghost behind the baby,that old creepy lady and the demon. Many movies fails when it comes to the ending,with like a bad twist or something but not this one,the ending is superior leaving us craving for more.

So, upon hearing from some friends and reading some reviews I decided to watch Insidious. From the trailer, one will obviously laugh this film off elsewhere. But once sat in front of the movie itself, it will pull you in and make your heart pound to the very end. This is no Friday the 13th, Nightmare on Elm Street, Paranormal Activity, Saw, etc. This is pure terror and it will scare the hell out of you. In every movie I've seen, I am eager and excited to see what is waiting on the other side of the door. This is the ONLY movie where I was begging the character NOT to open the door. Being PG-13, I was sure this would be another rotten egg, but this movie will push you.. until you fall over the edge. It takes you when you least expect it. You can't stop it.

Now alarm went off husband running around the house with an iron bar and wife was staying in the kid's room without even trying to call the police. Well I am a bit realistic freak. What would you do?? call the cops or wait for your husband to be a hero or get killed? Second point when they moved into the new house where did the 2nd boy go?? Did not show him for a bit.The ghost catcher lady said the husband was scared to take pictures. When she said that the wife looked really surprised!! Well you are married to someone for years who does not have any photo since child hood will raise some questions.and also the grand mother knew her son had the same problem. But she did not think it is important to share that. specially when they moved house because it was haunted and strange things were happening.At the end the whole devil trying to get into the real world scene was more funny than scary.Anyway I normally do not analyze too much,come on it's a movie!! But when I sit down to watch a scary movie I do not expect devil to look like a joker from a circus or more appropriate he looked more like darth maul from star wars.After this time I am never watching a movie reading reviews from IMDb.

527,callumthebeast,"Some clever and big scares, let down with lazy plot",7,26 February 2012,"With the 'saw' franchise at its (depressing and three dimensional) end, a horror sized hole in Hollywood has been created. With insidious hoping to fill it. Insidious follows the story of a family who are looking to prevent evil spirits from trapping their comatose child in a realm called 'the further'. With quite a unique concept does insidious deliver? and above all, scare?The effective technique to 'show as little of the villain as possible' in a horror film applies to Insidious all too much. This isn't a problem for the 1st half of the film, as the majority of the first 45 minutes doesn't include the main bad guy only his 'ghost henchmen'. When the main villain is eventually revealed to us the shocking effect of his first appearance quickly wears of, as he is showed time and time again. If they had just held back his screen time he would have been much more scary and shocking. Unfortunately this villain who was supposed to be the main centerpiece of the scares turns out the be the main centerpiece of the laughs.Saying that, I thought that some scenes where absolutely terrifying, showing sparks of genius at times.Especially at one point, which has to be one of the most unsettling scenes in horror film history ( in my opinion) I won' spoil it, all i'll say is 'tiptoe through the tulips'! The scares are partly down to tempo of the film, it takes a while to get started but once it does the scares hit hard in some clever sequences, this creates a really tense atmosphere that had me in hysterics. However i couldn't help but feel let down after the film as the terrific scares in this film are ruined by the ridiculous and unrealistic plot. As the plot gets more and more silly throughout the film, new characters are added, which just increases my annoyance! 3 characters enter the film who provide no scares or suspense whatsoever, they just drag the film down and pull the viewers away from the suspense by providing awful comedic value.This film provided terrifying moments at times, but the disappointing lack of realistic plot dragged the film down. If this film had maintained its suspense that was created by the 'ghosts' in around the 45 minute mark, this film would be a real winner and one worthy of attention. I want to give this film a 8 stars but the lack of plot, silly characters and unconvincing, tame bad guy means that i have to give this film a 7.Calum. Russell",Insidious
528,leonasunflower1978,Good fun but not very scary,6,7 May 2011,"I was expecting to be absolutely terrified by this film after reading many of the reviews on here. I am a huge horror fan and love to be scared (love eerie films such as the original Grudge, The Ring, The Others, Drag Me to Hell) and love being made to jump, so from that point of view I was very disappointed by this film.I actually found the film pretty enjoyable, good fun and very amusing but not sure that was entirely the intention of the film makers... The acting was fairly ropey, especially from Patrick Wilson who I've not seen in anything else so not sure if he's a sound actor usually?? I love Rose Byrne and she certainly did her best with the material, but why do characters in horror films always act in such an unrealistic and nonsensical way??!! Would you be able to nod off to sleep quite happily on your own the night after witnessing very obvious signs of a haunting in your house?? I sure wouldn't!!My husband and I are normally both very jumpy but neither of us jumped very much at all during this film. I did feel that the tension was built up quite well and loved the music but felt that the scares never really came to anything!! Maybe if I'd watched it at home on my own at night it would've seemed scary, but in the cinema surrounded by other people I wasn't remotely scared!

Rose Byrne and Patrick Wilson were amazing and good in their roles. the old woman in the beginning might not make sense but as you get towards the end it makes perfect sense. I found the actual creature that was trying to take over the young boy very creepy, i could only look at it for a couple of seconds before turning away. The further world was very creepy and surprised me when i saw it, i was expecting something crappy or not scary. The only i found funny instead of scary were the ghosts in the further world that smiled. Me and my friend cracked up when they would come on screen.

531,sam-50-208908,"Insidious, so close, so very close",7,10 May 2011,"Insidious is the newest film from duo James Wan (director) and Leigh Whannell (writer/actor) who were made infamous by their first film, Saw. Except this time, instead of starting a sub-genre, they're paying homage to another: the Haunted House genre, which includes films such as The Amityville Horror and House on Haunted Hill. Now as much as I like campy little tribute pictures, like Brutal Massacre or Grindhouse, I usually don't consider them great movies. The reason? As fun as it is to revisit a genre that is otherwise dead and gone, these movies don't really bring anything new to the table. That being said, Insidious was a delightful surprise.It keeps its heart close to home with the classics, but is totally original in both its execution and plot. Now you may think you've seen this movie before - quick shots of people walking by doorways, turns out a brutal multiple-homicide took place there years before, blah blah blah - but I assure you, you're wrong. The film does have some aspects of familiarity to them, there's no denying that, but it also has a refreshing edge that most recent horror films don't have. One of these things is that Insidious EARNS its scares. Yes, it does have the quick shots of things appearing and disappearing, loud noises, and all that jazz, but it also has a shocking number of scenes that rely on build-up and legitimately creepy circumstances instead of the pop-out scares that we're all so familiar with.Unfortunately though, Insidious isn't consistent. For every brilliant scene that is beautifully done, there are at least 3-4 that either don't make a whole lot of sense or are the cheap pop-out style scares. Also, the big reveal into what's going on in this movie was good, but it also missed the mark slightly; other scenes were carried out a bit too long and got a bit too ridiculous. One can see where they were trying to go with it, but it just didn't come out that great.It is unfortunate that this movie wasn't better received; they came so close to being a notable force in the horror genre, which is so desperately needed right now in main stream cinema, and personally I think James and Leigh would fit the bill wonderfully because they have something that very few people don't: heart, and they've got a ton of it",Insidious
532,Tonymjacques,This movies insane.,9,8 December 2011,"This movie is definitely one of my favorite horror movies. When i'd first seen the preview, I thought 'Hmm looks like it could be scary' but I got a lot more than i expected. I'm not going over exaggerate but this is THE scariest movie I have ever seen. Some might pick at it so they don't get scared, but seriously, just watch it. Don't expect anything good or bad of it. The way things popped up and how they looked were terrifying, and i typically don't get scared by movies and can predict most of whats going to happen, but when i saw it in theaters, by the 2nd half of the movie i was balled up in my sweatshirt, especially when it was coming closer to the end. Insidious was overall very good, very scary in my opinion and had great freaky music but the only reason i didn't give this a 10 is because i thought that the characters seemed a bit awkwardly written. Insidious is a nightmarish movie that still has me afraid to be alone in the dark at times.",Insidious
533,mattie88,"Don't be overly cynical, just enjoy the really scary ride",7,21 June 2011,"I've anticipated this movie for a few months now. And despite that it has a unoriginal storyline and is at times even a little corny (the opening credits will make you think of a lame Haunted House ride) it's the best horror movie I've seen since Paranormal Activity.This is not because of its originality, because frankly: it is not. Actually, it's the unoriginality that makes this a very scary movie. It uses tested scare tactics to create a suspenseful atmosphere and a few body-jolting moments without it being ridiculous overdone like in Drag me to Hell. I was slightly disappointed that the ending spun a little out of control, but it couldn't bother me so much that I thought of it as a bad movie afterwards. Basically I expected a scary movie, I got a terrifying one. What more can you ask for?It's very easy to dismiss this movie as one with a flimsy storyline or just plain ridiculous. But then you would miss the point of this film. It's not meant to have a great storyline. It's not meant to be original. It's just meant to scare the crap out of you for a (very, very) long hour and a half. And on that last point, it solidly delivers.",Insidious
534,jdonahue444,Excellent movie once again from the creators of saw,8,1 October 2011,"A fantastic original scary movie. I didn't see it in theaters but I still jumped. I probably would have peed my pants if I saw it in theaters. The music is perfect and it is played through out the movie at the right to make it even scarier. The movie starts out at a wife and her husband move into a house with their three children. Then the family starts to see ghosts and demons. While I was watching it, I thought of the amity ville horror and thought it was going to be another haunted house movie. But then the family moved back to their old house and they keep seeing these demons. Then you know its not an ordinary paranormal movie its something more. Since its from the creators of saw you know there will be a twist at the end and there is just not a huge one like saw. Its more like a wow not an OMG ending.",Insidious
535,sid-Jo,Insidious is chilling,8,11 May 2012,"This is a well directed 'family in a haunted house' movie that really has an air of creepiness. The main characters put in convincing performances and there is a strong air of menace attributed by fine camera-work and direction as it pans every room in expectation of something sinister in the offing. It has a realistic normal everyday feel as the newly arrived family carry a few anxieties on settling in, the father being a teacher busy with marking exams, the mother of three left to cope with unpacking, manage the kids and prepare the house. The creepy atmosphere leaves you feeling spooked and on edge and the strong sense something invisible and menacing is watching the occupants of the house within the house. I don't think i've ever seen a film where i am actually believing that this really is a haunted house, it permeates throughout and is totally convincing.If you want to be scared out of your wits this film will take you there. This is a house that looks and felt haunted and there are many heart stopping, jump out of your seat moments. This truly is a spine chilling film. I watched it alone in the dark, not a good idea.One downer is you are left wandering if the male investigators were in the right prffesion.",Insidious

On contrary, every great horror movie had great music score, as every major movie should have. I'm talking about music, not loud sounds combined with tense scenes which would scare about anyone I know, but has nothing to do with the atmosphere of the movie. Most of new movies are made like that and horrors are no exception. Music was and is great part of those great horrors and I kinda miss that in new ones. I'm no fan of horror like I'm no fan of any genre. I just like good movie. My point is that good music gives a movie a whole new dimension, which nowadays, unfortunately, happens on very rare occasions. Have a nice day, mate.",Insidious

Drag Me To Hell, Forget Me Not, Human Centipede and The Devil's Chair were all absolutely terrible- I don't know why Drag Me To Hell got such rave reviews. Horror isn't what it used to be. It is a dying, if not already dead, genre which relies on gore more than scares. James Wan's movies however, are different- they rely on genuine scares. Insidious, along with The Conjuring, is actually the scariest film I have ever seen in years. From the brilliant soundtrack, which is actually the best horror movie soundtrack I've ever heard, to the actual suspense itself, this is what makes Insidious so scary. The special effects are kept to a minimum, and the terror builds and builds, making the movie more and more scary. The acting is brilliant as well. I have taken a liking to James Wan's movies, and am definitely looking forward to the next one!",Insidious
538,Moataz_Mahmoud,"A very good drama, a modest production",6,2 June 2015,"I've watched a lot of movies before, many of high drama ones, many of intensive dose of action and many fascinating sci-fiction movies. But no movie has induced me to write a review about like this movie.Insidious is one of the most strange cinematographic works I've ever watched! The drama side of the movie is awesome. Most of scenes you can't predict it, and every prediction you build doesn't keep alive for more than 5 minutes, and then be broken by the following scene.The horror side also was accepted for me, it's not that fascinating one but it's accepted and not that bad. And also the sound effects worked well to make this movie more horrific.But what made me so sad, is the level of the production of this very strong scenario. There were many meaningless scenes and a lot of shots which were very terrifying but the actors didn't get terrified, and vice versa! There were many other scenes which were extremely underacting and failure to get me engaged with.One another good thing is the 20 minutes which was acted in the lost world when Josh tried to bring his son to the real life. That extraordinary idea which I didn't watch in any horror movie before. But still there were many scenes which didn't get performed well and many meaningless objects and ghosts in that world.Also there were many scenes which could be made better than that trivial way which ridicule from our minds! Like that one which ""Elise"" spoke ""Dalton"" and ""Specs"" translates what she said to The dad and the mom. And also like that scene in the lost world which the dad just said to the ghost ""Get away from me"" and push it away and the ghost disappears! And what made that scene more ridiculous was the reply of ""Elise"" in the real world when she said to him ""You are stronger than them Josh, you can win""!! If he was the strongest why he suffered to get out of that world and why the whole storyline originally!!Also one of the most admiring scenes in the movie was the paintings on the wall of, it was very expressive and a very good way to exchange the thoughts in silence.The last thing which I liked was the end of the movie which was extremely unpredictable, and not that ordinary one which drawn in our minds that the father will be the hero one and save his son and all things will be alright! Finally, this movie is still worth watching, but I hoped that the director was at that professional level which he produced ""The Conjuring"" withNOTE : Watch the chapter two, it may change many of these thought, it may be completely different.",Insidious
539,oakpill,Not entirely sure about this one...,4,14 December 2011,"A lot of people seem to like it, and I've seen it on many top 10 lists for horror movies of 2011. To be brief, I found the first 30 minutes or so very well done. But then the rest of the movie happened...For those of you who crave ""true"" horror, this may not be for you. A lot of the movie is very tongue in cheek. While there are some memorable scare moments, this movie handles its reveals like a true PG-13 film. That is, this movie should only be truly scare to those in the 13 and below bracket.Overall I found the film's plot sloppy. The entrance of two pseudo-comic relief characters mid point, who weren't even very well written, didn't help.As an aside, the use of Tiny Tim's ""Tip Toe"" as if it were some obscure ancient song of a forgotten bygone era is kind of ridiculous. Though I can see it being creepy for those who are less culturally aware (again, 13 and below for the most part).To close, I can see where the appeal is. But my personal tastes had my eyes rolling as this movie came to its conclusion. Just not my taste, or my style. PG-13 horror is best left to master directors (Spielberg's Poltergeist comes to mind), otherwise it kind of falls flat. Just my two cents. 4/10",Insidious
540,aleapug,A scary movie worth watching!,9,1 August 2013,"A great horror flick that will send chills down your spine, especially in the 2nd half of the film. James Wan brilliantly managed to create a superb horror flick without one drop of blood. While the violence in some horror films can add to the creepy atmosphere, this is not needed in ""Insidious"". Although the film relies heavily on jump scares; most do work and satisfy your need of jumping out of your seat. Watch this film if you are just getting into light horror films, because this flick does the trick.Rating: 9/10P.S. Definitely see ""The Conjuring"" which is now in theaters. It is triple the scary, and possibly one of the best horror films of the decade!",Insidious
541,ferna_oe,Clichés galore. Still fun to laugh at.,2,5 April 2016,"Insidious is another one to follow this late horror film tendency which started with the conjuring, to throw all the classic horror film elements onto the grill and shamelessly pretend to achieve something new or fresh, actually not achieving anything at all.As it starts, you can already take your notebook out and start checking on your cliché list: Old widow ghost, check, moving to an old haunted house check, baby monitors check, child's drawings check, rocking toy horse check, skeptical father, kid ghost, twins ghost, Gothic vampire ghost, esoteric technicians installing monitors, esoteric rites, the only missing stuff was the monster of Dr. Frankenstein, the mummy and green slime dripping off the walls.After all that mess, you get to see the father go into the beyond to rescue his child from a pedophile bondage sex loving demon, which instead of horrifying is ridiculous and cheesy as it can get. And predictably, an evil twist the end which of course is the trampoline production wanted to leave there in order to have a stating point for the obvious sequels, because, you never want to stop milking the cookie cutter horror films cow.Seriously, this film is far from horror. Is mostly an exercise for cinema students on how much used resources and clichés can ruin the very fabric of art. Think of this. How many changes should yo make to this film to turn it into a Scary Movie 9 or even an Adventure Time episode? Not many. That's how not scary it is.",Insidious

I have seen many horror films and this is definitely the least horrific one I have seen. We all have different scary levels though, but to me this was not one best horror films I have seen or one of the scariest. I would say this movie is specifically for ages 12 and up. I would say this is a good movie for sleepover or friend get-togethers because it is not too scary. I would not consider this movie for families. I would give the movie a 6 out of 10 for having to draw many conclusions and not having a very strong plot. Also this movie is very low budget with not many good scary scenes.",Insidious

To me a scary move doesn't just make you jump or squirm in the theater, but its stays with you. Making you check in the back seat, under the bed, and question every little bump in the night. Well Insidious did it, the first thing I said leaving the theater was, ""well I'm never sleeping again, how bout you?"" and what's more amazing it's not gory, which is something I would have expected having the SAW guys on board. Instead the movie works from the Paranormal Activity angle; building suspense to the point where your almost screaming ""oh just do it already"" cause you can't take it anymore (but in a good way). And one of the biggest things I noticed while sitting there was the ""cold"" feeling I had through most of the movie, I haven't had a movie do that to me in a long, long time.

They've managed to blend every possible horror cliché into one single film (which is no small feat, I must concede).It's the most obvious collection of teenager scares of all time ! Poorly written, awfully acted. And don't be mistaken: It's not the story that sometimes does scare the audience, but the sudden bursts of sound blasting your brains away when the director wants to have you scared.And yes, he did scare me, for I got pretty afraid that the soundtrack onslaught on my speakers would cause damage to them, so I turned off the whole thing and went back to my book.Awful !",Insidious

The most believable characters are the little boy who is the brother of Dalton (who is quietly forgotten halfway through the movie) and the paranormal investigators (who are wildly out of place, regardless of their realistic depiction). Every other character is a walking amalgamation of cliche and idiocy that grates on the mind. The monster(?) looks like an unused Scooby Doo villain in a Walmart costume that wouldn't frighten a 5 year old. The story's plot, using that term very loosely here, is so full of convenience and contrivance that it becomes meaningless. I, at one point, actually had to look up if James Wan had children, because how the parents act and react to their children is nothing like how any human would. I am actually worse off having watched this movie.",Insidious
548,forgingviews,Not as great or as bad as Some say,5,3 May 2020,"(NON SPOILERS SECTION)
This film was..... ok, I had somewhat high expectations of this film, my friends gave it good recommendations and when I saw James Wan was involved I got excited.This film kinda feels like if you combined Paranormal Activity with Poltergeist. And it kind of feels like a mess, it starts off pretty serious and grounded but it goes off into some really out there territory.A lot of the pieces were there but they don't quite hit the notes you want them to. Like a twist involving the father that didn't go where I expected, it just felt like the set up was kinda weak. There's so much stuff that happens and is explained in the third act that it feels rushed.I feel like this film could've benefited from being longer so it could build and set up the story more. That way the crazier third act may be more suited.(SOME SPOILERS AHEAD)
There's a point where the family find out their kids spirit is stuck in a different realm and the father has to astral project to find him. The ending of the film has the dad searching for his kid in this ""ghost dimension"". So personally I'm not a fan of this type of stuff in a horror film, it comes off kinda silly. Although I can admit it can be done well, it just didn't work for me here.Overall I found it average, it ramped up without much setup, the characters weren't super compelling, and the acting was alright.The main reason I wrote this review is because most of the reviews I saw on here were either great or terrible and I didn't see much middle ground. It was an ok watch but it felt like a conjuring film that missed the mark.",Insidious

Well it is nothing like a typical cheap horror with an expected banal plot, it rather has a very solid story that would fit into a rare category of emotionally intensed drama. The story is written on a strong ground of mythology and spirituality, and the writer touches the horror aspects of this environment in a precise manner. You will probably find yourself connected to each member of the family and feeling the psychological trauma they got into. This is also one of the very few movies in its genre that has a great success in the open ending that it makes a balance between a satisfying closure to the current plot and a powerful hook to the next film in sequence.

The direction was amateurish. The camera angles were awful and (one of my pet peeves) WAY too many close ups. The make-up looked like it was done by high school kids.You never really connect with any of the characters so you don't care what happens to any of them. The whole thing was just BAD.Wait for this to come out on DVD or even cable. I read all the good reviews and thought that the bad reviews were just people that don't really like horror movies.

I've seen a lot of Horrormovies but I don't think I want to see this one again, or maybe in clear daylight (lol). After seeing this movie I've noticed it was directed also by James Wan, just like ""Dead Silence"". This man seems to know exactly how to keep the audience in fear the entire movie.

As a horror fan myself for nearly 40 years I was pleasantly surprised by this genuinely creepy and sometimes spooky sinister movie. Yes! it has a lot of idea's that have worked for some of the classics like Poltergeist, but I feel it moulds them together to deliver an excellent adrenalin fuelled ride for those of us who enjoy a refreshing take of a modern day horror movie (sadly there ain't too many these days that don't resort to buckets of tomato sauce and various body parts rejected from the butchers or fishmongers!) This is one of the very few movies that does not rely on the said stuff in brackets to bring a racing pulse and sweaty palms...well for me anyway! I found myself creep ed out in such a way it was almost too compelling to watch in parts. So if you like a creepy movie that is NOT a slash-fest then this maybe the film for you. Just turn the light off. Light a few candles and enjoy. As a side note (and I noticed some others mentioned this too) the overly noisy bangs in the film, meant to make you jump, do get annoying. This is my only criticism. But most films these days (modern ones) rely on overly noisy bangs, do they not? Also I think the PG 13 rating is spot on. Younger children would be a little too freaked by this I think. But because of its no gore value older children may enjoy this too. All in all I feel this will appeal to real ""old school"" horror fans like myself who were brought up on Hammer Horror...the only thing missing was a Hammer babe!

The ending (and I only watched the whole flick because it got to the point where I had to see if it could get any more idiotic) is laughable, and the most frightening part of the entire time-wasting experience is the way that the formerly hot Barbara Hershey has aged. On the other hand, it was fun to see Farrelly Bothers favorite Lin Shaye in a role like this, and Patrick Wilson did give us Lynch in The A Team. So they get a pass.

555,KevLysaght,There is hope left for the genre after all,8,19 May 2011,"As a hardcore Horror-fan I had begun to lose hope in the genre over the last few years, what with films such as Scre4m being churned out of the mixer. I can honestly say that after seeing this gem, my faith has been restored. The film takes time to build suspense for the viewer meaning the action takes a while to kick off, however once it does, you are somewhat thankful that it took so long. Throughout the film, the writers use different styles of 'scares' ranging from your typical 'something jumping out of the closet to a sharp Violin solo' to 'creepy, spine-tingling imagery'. This meant that you literally had no clue where the next 'jump out of your seat' moment was coming, a feat not upheld by the majority of the genre today. Despite James Wan; responsible for 'Saw', directing Insidious, there was not a spec of gore or a hint of torture-porn involved in it. This made it feel fresh and proved how films can be scary without having to sling intestines at us in 3D. The film, however was not perfect. The last 20 minutes of the film act as a metaphorical gust of wind to the pyramid of cards that the first hour had built up. Some poor attempts at CGI and a flurry of pointless cheap thrills make it seem that the writers lost their way a little bit near the end. The whole concept of the film, although fresh in modern Horror terms, is not as unique as the writers would have you believe, which in some ways is not so bad however some fans may feel ripped off. There was also a degree of light humour provided by Leigh Wannell and his partner, which distracted from the fear slightly (altough I personally welcomed it). Overall the film is suspenseful and immersive, taking the best parts of films such as Poltergeist, Shutter and Paranormal Activity and making a brilliant piece of cinema. This is almost certainly a 'must-see' for horror fans, especially those who haven't felt a true scare for a while.",Insidious

Insidious started off OK but quickly turned into just another horror film with a lack of ideas. the film really started to go downhill when the mothers friend appeared. the 'out of body experience' was laughable and really spoilt the film. we both thought that sequence was awful. it looked like something a bunch of school kids had put together with no money to spend. very disappointing considering how good paranormal activity was. it just goes to show that less is more.,Insidious
557,jacobconant,Hands down the best PG-13 horror movie ever,8,1 April 2011,"When I went to the theater to see this, I had been excited for awhile. And boy, did this movie deliver. But it unexpectedly did more. I was thinking you'd get your exorcism, with everything being all happy and good in the end, but I honestly was not expecting something that complex. I'll come out and say it: The outline of the movie was not that original, but what the writers did with the traditional ghost story was amazing. They twisted it to make it not so much about the ghosts, but about what was going on to the family in the house. How they were taking it.The effects were great for this type of movie, which really only require a slamming door or a random person standing in. And I also thought the actors did a great job. I particularly liked Patrick Wilson playing the father that doesn't want to have any part of the hokus-pokus ghost stories, but is sort of pulled into it against his will. The best part: It was genuinely scary. There is virtually no gore, because it's not needed to build the creepiness of the plot. It sort of builds and is intense right from the get go. I'm a major scary movie veteran, and I was truly scared (which doesn't happen often). I highly recommend this movie to anyone up for a good scare. If you aren't an experienced scary movie watcher, this is a good starter. And trust me, you will check all the closets and doors when you get home from the theater.",Insidious

The camera movements, the dark sensibility of the scenes and fear factor. The opening remind me of hitcock and a little bit of f.w. murnau (nosferatu) with the music and the gritty INSIDIOUS in red.I tried to brave throughout 87% of the film, but i ended up failing freaking out for the last 30 minutes....but that later.Renai, Josh and their 3 children move into a new house. Life seems good but right away strange things start to happen. She wakes up, and her son eerily tells her he doesn't like his bed room.As the film progressed, i realized that it was not just another haunted house film. I loved the twists and turns in the story, like moving from a large three story house, to a considerably small ranch styled home. Even though they had moved, the things Renai were seeing didn't go away. Finding out that the child was being haunted instead put me on edge ""It's not the house that's haunted"" wooh, that is scary. I loved the camera movements and the quick shot tricks and shadow/lighting contrasts helped the film become more scary during first person view.After they find out the real reason things are wrong, the movie quickly sped up and before i knew it i was covering my eyes hoping for the best with these lovable and relatable characters. The film ended in a twist that reminded me of Dead Silence, mainly because of the woman in 19th century clothing. The twist was expected a bit, but i was shocked when at the only physical death and i was also left wondering what happened at the end when she turned around.It was fun and scary.

The acting was woeful (even the great Rose Byrne and Barbra Hershey couldn't save it). The suspense was non existent and I just couldn't get into the movie. There was no explanation of why the child was in a coma. They tried to explain it toward the end (badly) but by then, you just didn't care.The story line was just a cheap, bad rip off of Poltergeist. It was just plain dumb. It could have been better developed but the result is an epic fail.Don't waste your time with this rubbish. If you want to see something better, see the original Poltergeist. If you are a fan of Wan and Whannell, stick with SAW.",Insidious

I can't imagine how wonderful is this film, i love this film...simply LOVE IT, have an excellent PLOT, amazing Performances, amazing SCRIPT, amazing CHARACTERS! wow, this must be the most original horror film since EVIL DEAD, i am 15 years old and i have watched more than 500 American horror films, then like 200 foreigner horror films, i think i have the correct mind to review this film and say that is one of the greatest horror films and gonna marks history. The producers of SAW?...Yeah! they do this film, James Wan have an interesting view of Horror films....i like that view.",Insidious
562,quinncraig,One of the better unintentional comedies I've seen,1,7 April 2011,"Well - to say this movie contains every ghost story, horror movie cliché ever used would be an understatement. But - for me that is exactly what made it entertaining to watch. I still can't decide whether the creators were using every trick in the book on purpose as a joke or if they really thought they were making something new and shocking? I would put my money on this whole thing being a big joke because I know these guys can make scary movies if they want to. I am rather surprised at how many reviewers say this is the scariest movie they have ever seen! I suppose if you have never seen a single horror movie in your life this might make sense - but for those of us who have seen ""Poltergeist"" or ""The Shining"" you absolutely know exactly what is coming around each corner of this film, right down to the piano strikes and violin shrills when something jumps out at you. As other reviewers have said - this movie starts off pretty strong and seems to really try and build an eerie atmosphere - but by the film's midpoint it sinks into just plain silliness and becomes almost slapstick comedy by the end. What other reviewers are not saying is that not only does the movie quickly sink into a world of silly clichés - but it also seems to lose all of it's budget. To me it seemed like the production quality suddenly drops off and starts looking like a cheesy straight to video horror movie from the 1980's. Ghosts are clearly just stage hands in white face makeup surrounded by smoke from a fog machine. The final 10 minutes when all hell breaks loose has one of the most non shocking endings ever. If you don't see it coming a million miles away then you are one of those people who has never seen a horror movie before this one. In conclusion - This movie should absolutely be marketed as a horror/comedy (if not a straight up comedy). Every moment that was supposed to make you jump with fear instead made me convulse with laughter. So if you are looking for a good scare - don't watch this movie - but if you just want to be entertained and have a good laugh then by all means check it out.",Insidious
563,giveandsee,"Great move, but def. not what I thought it was",9,2 April 2011,You know how you think you have a movie figured out before going to see it? Well I thought Insidious was one of those movies. I thought it was a run of the mill scary movie. However the concept was different.I thought the movie was well put together. At times I thought the plot was a little shaky but it managed to correct that thought.The actors really did a good job with making their roles believable. The concept of the plot made us think if this stuff actually goes on...If your looking for a movie that does not fit inside the normally box of movies in this genre then this is it.Good Movie! I recommend you go see it!,Insidious
564,shaen_cool,Surprisingly Chilling,8,24 April 2011,Just came back watching this movie...and believe me i was not expecting the goosebumps and shocks this movie delivered. James Wan managed to scare us in this low budget movie. When i came out the theater i had a smile on my face as i was happy after a very long time we got something new and stylish. This is definitely not a movie for weak hearts. This movie is kind of creepy that makes for a great night at the movies if you're into that sort. Rose Byrne delivered a descent performance. I was totally not expecting what i got to see by chance. In short this movie delivers the jumps which you expect from a nice horror genre. A movie not be missed and one my favorites now.,Insidious

The plot starts off fine than after an hour i'am thinking wait haven't i seen this plot before oh yeah poltergeist. I laughed through the entire film i thought it was a horror movie not a comedy and the end was awful. I thought the writer of saw and the director of paranormal activity would be able to make a good descent horror film that actually would make me jump and be scared boy i was wroung. So take my advise and do not see this dreadful film.",Insidious
566,laurenlchilcott,a really good scare,8,19 September 2011,"i just recently watched this film (with my mum lol) and thought it was pretty damn scary wasn't really expecting it really just thought it was a typical average American horror and my mum who is usually a massive horror fan even pooped herself and couldn't turn the light off for a while before bed lol, the whole atmosphere of the film is creepy throughout and all the actors did brilliantly, i will say when the sort of ghost busters got called i thought what the hell as a couple of geeky guys turned up but they turned out to be alright really. as it said it was from the same people who did saw and paranormal activity i thought it would have lots of blood and guts but was nothing like saw and had more of a paranormal activity feel to it where u don't really expect whats going to happen. i would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who loves a good horror and likes jumping out of your skin at very freaky unexpected moments. to summarise it up its well worth a watch (if your a horror fan but if your a comedy lover i would give this a miss lol) and a good decent horror for the year.",Insidious
567,plot180,"The best since ""Poltergeist""",7,2 July 2011,"James Wan's finest! A very well-directed and written movie, no doubt. As I was watching i had visions from ""Poltergeist"" and ""The Entity"". Wan payed a great homage to these paranormal movies of the 80's and won't let you down. This is a very good movie, worth watching in a movie theater. And it scares, in these days it's hard to come by. The key Wan uses here is to keep it simple and clean, no gore or violence but following a solid story makes this film much stronger than just a horror and gory movie. Wan is not used to this, that's why we see a more serious side of him, that I loved. This one did take me back to those days and trust me, it scares! Let's not also forget the presence of Barbara Hershey, the one who scared a generation in ""The Entity"". Go see this, if you love paranormal, this is the right formula for a good movie.",Insidious
568,info-347-916579,Insidious gets so much right that I can't seem to understand why I'm finding it so hard to look past it's flaws...,7,18 April 2012,"oh Insidious...my mother tried to warn me about you.... You smooth talking little pg-13 number. I had my guard up too.. I wasn't about to let your first and second acts woo me into a false sense of security. After all, this is'nt my first rodeo you know. I know better than this.. I really do. You came on strong and told me everything that I wanted to hear... You provided an easy to follow plot with plenty of tension and well acting. You had me all figured out. A couple of drinks later and i'm naked in a truck stop bathroom, trying to find my cell phone and the faint hint of ether still hangs in the air.. I thought you loved me... OK... Now that I've been to group and have the emotional tool sets to cope, lemme give you my real insidious review. Hold on... What I meant to say is, "" let me preface my Insidious review."" I am in the business of horror movies. I have seen the good, the bad, the weird and the batshit intolerable ones. An homage to me at this point is useless. Most modern horror films are already homages, minus the self awareness that makes them endearing. ( see my Scream 4 review) Thus now beginneth the odyssey that is my mixed feelings on Insidious. Insidious gets so much right that I can't seem to understand why I'm finding it so hard to look past it's flaws. Insidious opens with such an oppressive heavy feeling of dread that it's hard not to be affected by the tone of this picture. It is the tone of Insidious that automatically Draws you into it. It establishes a universe that is easy to believe and easy to live in for the duration of the film. It is a universe very much like our own with a couple who could easily be your next door neighbors. They are unspectacular and ordinary in all the right ways and add to the general believability that is one of insidious's many strengths.Make no mistake, Insidious works.. It works so well on so many different levels that it feels like little more then a cheap shot when i start to point out it's weaknesses. I love the paranormal. For all it's nerdy chicanery, the world of the paranormal is still a fun and provocative place. Maybe it is my decade long inundation of this world that ultimately starts to pull me out of the Insidious universe. You see, I am more of a journey than a destination guy. Endings rarely give me the kind of gratification that getting there does (don't let this disuade you from trying ladies.. Ziiiiing!!!!). ""The Further""' the mystical Pangea that connects our world to another for those unluckiest of astral travelers who reach it, works better as an unseen threat. The moment we enter The Further, we enter into a navigable world with rules, guidelines and limitations. It is here that Insidious's creep factor starts to drop off sharply. One of the good things about Insidious is that it has come out in a time where the horror genre is so steeped in pointless torture porn clones that even when it comes dangerously close to ripping off some of it's predecessors (again, sometimes an homage in all it's flattery can still seem unnecessary when the plot device mimicked is a central crux to the story) it is almost welcome.In all sincerity there are many, many good things about insidious including all of the fine performances turned in from Patrick Wilson, Rose Byrne and the rest of the cast, including Barbara Hershey. It is Lin Shaye that does a pretty good Zelda Rubinstein and makes her part one of the most memorable (sad it is though I will always remember her from the farrely's brothers' Kingpin - ""what is it about good sex that always makes me have to crap?"" Insidious's score is really the trump card here. Joseph Bishara has brought the heebyjeebies and his A-game giving every moment of the film a lush texture of anxiety and fear. For those of you that miss the film's finer visual points, it's hard to knock this soundtrack, one of the better I've heard from a horror offering in years. Insidious is memorable, even if some of those memories may seem a little ""borrowed"". Recommended",Insidious
569,deek172,"Started out a bit slow but wow, had me tensed up all to the end",9,3 April 2011,"Unlike what seems like most of the reviews are from, I'm not a movie critic or ""self appointed"" movie expert and I'm not going to use big words to sound all educated and knowledgeable(except this one)...I just wanna let everyone know it's a pretty good horror movie, and it's been a long time since I've seen one as scary.Anyways, I took my girlfriend to watch this and it did start out very slow and had me a bit worried that I picked a movie that might suck. But once it picked up(about 20 mins in) it didn't me down.Scary as hell, that's pretty much all all I have to say. Only thing I would call a ""complaint"" is that the ghost's near the end seemed a bit ""haunted house"" or not very scary at times haha. But that's only at certain times. Most of the time, I was jumping left and right.A lot of the popups were obvious but holy crap, I still jumped haha.",Insidious

I am glad it was a different kind of ""possession"" movie, I loved that it wasn't just about possession, but it was a true haunting. It felt like a Fun house, a haunted house, it was just awesome in theaters because everyone in the theater was jumping and exclaiming when the jump scares came around, and not in an annoying way. I will say I loved it more in theaters than watching it at home, I liked the big in your face scares, when they are smaller(size wise) it is a little harder to get into, but that is true of most horror movies I suppose.",Insidious
571,joedavo96,"Scary, surreal and strange.",8,22 June 2013,"Insidious is a horror film that doesn't rely on gore to scare its audience, it instead relies on an eerie atmosphere to frighten us. The paranormal and surreal aspects of the film are reminiscent of horror classics 'The Exorcist' and 'The Shining'. Be warned, Insidious has plenty of jump scares. These jump scares however, unlike most today, are anything but cheap. The film's script as well as James Wan's direction is fantastic, giving the viewer a relentless sense of paranoia throughout the film's entirety. The plot surprisingly delves deep into a supernatural story that is hauntingly fascinating. The less you know before watching this movie, the better. Insidous will keep you up until 3:00am and give you a sense of urgency to make sure there is no one standing behind your bedroom window.",Insidious

They tried to combine ghosts, demons, creepy kids, astral projection, Darth Maul and possession into one movie.Horrible acting and a plot that feels like it got randomly generated coupled with stupid characters with no semblance of intelligence or likableness.Although the first 20 minutes was good, and the first 40 minutes was moderately scary, the rest had me cracking up when Darth Maul's face from Star Wars started making guest appearances all over the house, and when the creepiest music they could find was bloody Tiny Tim.

But looking at the current movie review when you first jump on the page I completely disagree and I feel another perspective may help people who are considering watching 'Insidious' for the first time.I have seen just about every horror film you can think of. From mainstream to independent, Asian and European etc. Not a lot scares me other than maybe 'The Strangers' but 'Insidious' is a film with a truly intriguing storyline, excellent acting and genuine scares.Its not the type of film that relies heavily on death counts or blood and gore but goes right back to how a horror film should be - scary and eerie and should have an unsettling feeling in your stomach days after watching it.'Insidious' is a ghost story with a twist and defiantly something not yet done in previous horror films. Yes, it does borrow from the likes of films like 'Poltergeist' but does not copy it just borrows certain elements and makes it it's own.I am not going to give you a run down of scene for scene or any spoilers as I think you would get the gist from the synopsis and I don't want to ruin anything but I will tell you 'Insidious' has a classic horror feeling right from the introduction. The music is so creepy that it makes you feel uncomfortable, the scares are disturbingly eerie and the acting is top notch. This movie is a 10/10 for me nd no matter how many times I watch i I still feel uncomfortable. That's what a true horror film should do. Always stay with you, each and every-time you watch it.'Insidious: Chapter 2' Comes out This weekend in the USA (I have to wait a bit long as I'm in Perth, Australia) but once you watch 'Insidious' and see how the movie finishes you'll be running to the cinema to see what happens next.'Insidious' will remain a classic horror film and will not be forgotten in years to come.",Insidious
574,booradey,Horrific Sound & Character Design,4,2 November 2020,"This movies immersion was ruined from the get go, with overbearing sound design which rather than existing to support the plot, overshadowed it completely. There were multiple moments where they had a baby screaming for no reason, or has loud dissonant chords not to set a tone but just to piss the viewer off, in my opinion.Not only that, but the character/monster design. None of them seemed to be from the same world, genre, or connected by anything at all. This once again ruined the immersion and removed any semblance of horror, since I was laughing too hard.

James wan has truely lived up to my expectation of how to display a good horror movie properly. The makeup, the jump scares, the acting, the producing. It's all amazing.

So someone like me goes into this movie with very low expectations. ""the further...?"" come on. Every aspect of this movie advertises cheese. And interestingly they kept some cheese in there. (Something they could work on) The name too.Regardless, you get a lot more then what you expect. You're swept away into the typical ""our house is haunted and it really scares me: lead-stay-at-home mom/actress; honey you have nothing to worry about: dad-etc."" The spooks come on quick and they crescendo at a good pace, never letting you down. If you're like everyone else in judeo-Christian, post-post modern, western civilization then there is that belief stuck in the back of your head that there IS something going on and there could be something like this happening, somewhere. (i.e. ghosts, demons, what have you, do exist) After too many wobbling camera's, weird walking dirty girls who's hair always covers their face for the first 80%, and paranormal activities abounding, this movie steadies the lay of the horror genre by cutting to the chase quickly, and starts the actors running with good old-fashion, I'm keeping the lights on after I'm done watching this, fun.

The disappointment that I experienced while watching this film may have been as intense due to my high expectations. That being said, it didn't bother me that the story has been done over and over again. I wasn't even all that disappointed that it wasn't as scary as I had hoped (they usually never are anyway). It did have one or two moments during which I was startled enough to jump a bit. What upset me, was how unbelievably stupid it was. I actually laughed out loud when they referred to the other realm as ""the further"". I get that it was, in part, an homage to Poltergeist (one of my all time favorite movies). But really? The Further? I think some level of respect for the audience would have been nice. I felt like a child being coddled through a scary story the entire movie. The ending was one of the more disappointing aspects of the movie. I won't give it away, but I definitely sat there for a moment as the credits rolled up the screen feeling truly let down. What we have here is a film that begins strong, but after about 15 minutes dwindles to nothing more than a complicated story that never fully makes sense, a few less than terrifying monsters, and a truly disappointing ending. I know I'm in a bit of the minority, the people I saw this film with actually loved it. And they love horror as much as I do (you don't know me, but I LOVE me some horror movies).

Insidious however did not disappoint. This film blew me away. From the makers of Saw I was expecting a lot of gore and cheesy lines, instead I was shown a masterpiece. The opening credits were like a style icon in the land of film; the mixture of eerie music, black and white visuals and red graphics sets the mood for the film. Throughout feature it uses the 'good old conventions' for horror films, but instead of paranormal activity where it was really cheesy, the slamming of doors,creaking of floor boards and the rocking of a rocking horse all fits in a new fresh way, that will make the audience jump - it made me jump and I never jump at horror films. The end of the film starts to feel like a game, the lighting, setting are amazing and I felt completely immersed in the whole style of it.Overall if you like old horror's, then this is a new contemporary horror film that has a great nod at the classic's, and is amazing.",Insidious

Not since the 70's when the Exorcist was released, has there been any film which has made me really jump several times, not want to look at the screen on a few occasions and have an effect on me after the film had finished. I left all passage lights on when I went to bed the first time in over 30 years and didn't want to look in the mirror when washing my teeth just in case someone would be looking over my shoulder.

However there is a a nice twist at the end that brought the rating back up a little bit..I would recommend it for watching it with your girlfriend if you are after an 'easy scare', but not if you are expecting a believable story line.Starts Well, ends well, just a few dodgy bits that are hard to swallow.

When I was 5 years old my father took me to see Poltergeist in the theater. That movie stirred fears in me that took decades to quell (remember, I was 5). Poltergeist created a genuine love for the genre but also very high bar for other movies to reach. In other words, a movie has to offer some truly shocking and creepy, unsettling moments to take home with me when the movie is over for me to even remember it,With that being said, this movie will haunt me for years, and that says A lot. I went to see the Sunday matinée (nearly empty theater adds to the creepiness), and I was COMPLETELY FLOORED by the amount of hair raising, spine-tingeing, jumping-out-of-my-own-skin moments that this movie packed. THIS MOVIE WAS AMAZING!! I have seen most, if not all of the acclaimed horror flicks, Nightmare on Elm, Friday the 13th, Halloween, The Ring, Paranormal Entity/Activity, Amityville, and many,many,many more. NONE OF THEM CAME CLOSE TO DELIVERING LIKE THIS MOVIE DID!!!!! Poltergeist came on at a distant 2nd place tied with the Ring and maybe the Grudge.I would do this movie an injustice by telling you why I rated it 9 out of 10. See it for yourself and make your own judgement. If you like a good scare, you won't be disappointed.IF YOU WANT A CREEPY MOVIE THAT YOU WILL REMEMBER FOR A LONG TIME TO COME, AND THAT WILL KEEP YOU GLANCING IN THE SHADOWS FOR WHAT MAY BE LURKING, THIS IS THE MOVIE TO SEE!!!!

As far as all the other reviews that list this waste of time as being one of the scariest films, I just don't get it.It was nothing more than a low-budget amateur attempt at a Poltergeist remake, and a really bad one at that. Apparently Barbara Hershey needed the check as well as the rest of the cast. They all acted as if they were thinking of somewhere else they'd rather be. I kept waiting for all those really scary moments that everyone was talking aboutI'm still waiting. I laughed throughout the film, especially when Elise waits till Josh gets the crap beat out of him by the big bad demon, before she tells him he is stronger than the demon while looking for his son.The story was a farce, the acting was lame, and I've seen scarier demons at my front door on Halloween.The only horrors about this film were that I had to hear Tip Toe Through the Tulips after all these years of trying to block it from memory and that I paid $20 for this complete waste of time.",Insidious

I love watching them and then being disappointed at their utterly predictable failure. When I saw the poster advert for this movie, I wasn't even interested! The old ""possessed kid"", or demon child bit has been done to death, especially recently. I didn't even give the trailer a chance. But for whatever reason I just decided to check it out. And from the first 30 seconds of the film, to this exact moment right now, I have an eerie, creepy, wrenching feeling stuck in my gut. I feel like something is over my shoulder, and I am stressed out! I don't want to turn off my lights, or look out my window blinds. I am now afraid to open my bedroom door, after having closed it! (and locked it) My Review: The film is done perfectly. It had a little bit of everything, even a few light moments of humor. But not enough to draw you away from the sinking feeling it gives you. The musical score, sounds more like alarms in your brain telling you to RUN! You don't just hear it, you are bothered by it! The physical settings, were a perfect backdrop with an oldness that in a way became a character in itself! The acting, each character and their roles, and the way they where affected by....by the ""main antagonist"" as I will put say!!!!!!!!!! uh (shivering) I just need to forget that face, and that sound, those movements, for the rest of my LIFE!!!! My mind is totally playing tricks on me now!!!! But... on another note..... WATCH THIS MOVIE, preferably with BACKUP, and follow it up with a Care Bears and Rainbow Bright Marathon!! Its the only thing that will get you emotionally back into shape, and able to physically, and mentally function afterward! ""HOORAY"" to the writers, director, and actors who finally for once, assembled such a great horror film. It should be re-released! (golf clap) (Note: there is more film after the credits!!!)",Insidious
591,smallvillefan6290,Better than most offerings in today's horror market,7,1 September 2013,"I decided to finally get around to seeing this film after seeing that it was time for the second one to come out and I found The Conjuring to be a pretty good modern horror movie. For the first hour of the movie I found the suspense and scares to be well done. It's not often that I can compliment a modern horror movie for that. For the last 40 minutes of the movie, however, I didn't enjoy nearly as much. While it still had that creepy mood I didn't really have the same feeling as the first half of the film. This movie did a good job of establishing its own mythology in the confines of its world and I found it to be overall pretty well done. However, the being that was shown only in shadows was better done by just sticking to the shadows. Later in the movie they show it up close and it lost a little bit of the edge it had while keeping to the edges of sight. The ""home"" of this thing was also quite well done for the design and definitely had a sense of dark humor about it with the workshop (Tiny Tim music was great).The ending, which a lot of people seem to have issues with, makes sense to me personally just due to all the threads laid out all throughout the runtime. However it left some unanswered questions that I'm hoping the sequel will elaborate on and allow for a 2-part end to this storyline instead of pulling a Paranormal Activity which still leaves some unknown things in the air for years.Overall, I actually do recommend this movie. It has a well done suspense feel for the most part and was definitely an enjoyable film for myself since I usually wind up just rewatching horror movies in the 80s and further back. I gave this movie a 7/10 due to some of the issues with the tone change at the hour mark, the (for lack of a better term) sequel bait ending that didn't fully cover the ramifications, and some points that I just wound up losing interest due to some parts having some slow pacing.Regardless of these things, just watch the movie and decide for yourself. It's certainly not a bad movie by any stretch and will allow for some enjoyment of the modern movie market, at least for a horror fan.",Insidious
592,liamq9,couldn't call it a horror movie !,4,19 May 2011,"The movie overall was average, i wouldn't go out my way to watch it though. I went into the cinema feeling like it was going to be one of the scariest movies of all time (what i had heard) and it just didn't reach its potential, the story line was poor and was all got abit stupid and cheesy. The first 30minutes are OK but after that it seems they ran out of ideas! I would say paranormal activity it better than this, because this looked fake, the 'ghosts' didn't look very real and all just seemed like bad acting. on the other hand the director does know how to make it tense. Also, they say it's a horror movie but i didn't see much blood or any gory deaths !, hardly any deaths. Was a cheesy movie with a poor story line with poor acting.",Insidious
593,studioscarab,Worst in Years!,1,6 February 2012,"I always have to laugh out loud when people say that either this film scared them, or they enjoyed in the least. I'm sorry, but it's a natural reaction. This film was recommended to me by someone who saw it in the theater, so I went with a filmmaker friend of mine figuring I was going to have the crap scared out of me, and I found myself not only laughing in the theater, but he and I were exchanging looks like 'really...this is what we paid 11 bucks for?"". Although maybe some thought the premise was original, when they reveal what is happening to the kid, I had to chuckle. We both were so disappointed in this, that when I see what the film cost to make, and what it made in theaters, it makes me sad, since there are so many other better films out there that are indie horror films more deserving financial success. You want to see a great indie horror film, check out the french film ""Inside"". Much better and very scary. I don't post many reviews, only when I feel strongly about a film, and this film is horrible, laughable and I'd caution you on wasting your time on it.",Insidious
594,imanerd115,This was a horror movie?,8,18 November 2011,"This movie does have some jump scenes in it, but I found it to be satirically hilarious. The entire movie I was laughing and screaming consistently. It's absolutely bizarre and hilarious. I can't imagine this wasn't a joke. If it was, this is brilliant. If it wasn't, oh well, watch it anyway, it was still funny. Definitely fun to watch, definitely funny, great movie to watch with friends.The movie has kind of a cheap look to it, and the costumes and special effects are absolutely terrible, which just makes the entire movie more hilarious. Very solid acting, unexceptional sound track. Don't think it's not scary, there are some very intense scenes, but you're going to be laughing more than screaming. Enjoyable, fun, frightening... can a movie get any better?",Insidious
595,unlusan,I like it,6,3 July 2011,"The producers made their homework. They searched what people found scary in other films and then added the old woman in veil and dead family from ""The Others"", weird toy maker clown face from ""Saw"", big scary guy with a mask from various knife yielding murderer films such as ""Jason' & ""Halloween"", little bit of ""Elm Street"" etc. Kidnapping vessels idea is from the ""Skeleton Key"".The film is clearly very similar to ""Poltergeist"" with the little expert old women and the ghost-buster geeks trying to rescue a little kid trapped in the Further. The film changes completely in the middle from a haunted house film to a weird fantasy world film like ""Pan's Labyrinth"". Overall it was an interesting, entertaining and scary film. I like it.",Insidious
596,nickelsdimes2077,Slightly above average; but the average isn't great,4,3 June 2012,"The film creates suspense very effectively through the lighting and sound. That being said, the suspense of the same violin screech, or twang, or bass sound becomes increasingly less effective. By halfway through the film, they were largely more annoying than anything else. At the beginning of the film, there is a nice mix of light and darkness, but this is abandoned in the last 1/3 of the movie. Ominous shadows and rooms give way to the sporadic flashlight, and in tandem with the unending screeching of the violin, it made me angrier more than anything else. Jumpy cuts led to some jump-in-your-seat moments, as you would expect. Overall, I think the movie is executed better than the horror films we're used to, mainly because it's a call back to the time when horror films were about suspense, not violent bloody mutant or alien murder. Compared with the films of today, I would say it was above average. But, if you compare it to the older titles of the kind (Rec comes readily to mind), you will be far less impressed.I sat down to watch a suspenseful movie, and that's pretty much what I got. However, I won't be watching it again and I won't be suggesting it to anyone.",Insidious
597,avanti_nn,I thoroughly enjoyed it without getting scared out of my wits,6,20 September 2012,"It was a horror film. I get scared pretty easy but I did not get scared in this film. And I think that it was because the director made it in a way that the film carried the spook and yet was watchable so that viewers focused more on the story than the spook. Often horror film buffs watch horror films to get the kick out of it, of getting scared out of their wits. This film did not scare me out of my wits. It allowed me to watch, understand and absorb the story that was being narrated through the motion picture. And I liked it. A well made horror film in a while is what I would call it. It was not just sensational horror drama to give adrenaline the kick that a lot of horror film buffs want. The performance given by Rose Byrnes was outstanding. It absolutely was something that new actors should learn from. Overall I had a great time watching this film, it was far from disappointing for a horror film fan. And I hate gore horror films.",Insidious

""Solid"" is a good word to describe the first half of the film. It may resemble many other horrors from the past, but it did well in telling its own story at its own pace. Maybe it wasn't an icon to ""the most scary is what you don't see"" philosophy but it did well. Unfortunately something broke down along the way...Such a great potential to make a good horror in the era of torture porn trash thrown away by the creators that gave up to the urge ""to show more"".

I will say that this movie did impress me though. It isn't really scary, at all, creepy is more of the term I would use. Not once did I just feel like my heart was gonna explode, and anyone who says that it was terrifying was probably 1. a twilight fan or 2. a 15 year old girl, sorry but this isn't scary. Dead Silence was better in my opinion for the whole scare factor, and it was only a shock and awww film. Insidious is the type of movie that inspires a dark, eerie mood. It was a little to similar to poltergeist though in my opinion. I put this up because I was sick of people saying this is terrifying when in fact it isn't even close. I do recommend that you should watch it though, especially if you like poltergeist type movies.",Insidious

New media will never be credible with this kind of attitude! When bad acting meets lack of creativity, you get a scary movie like this one... why don't they start to show us a black screen and then pop - up some white faces and scream when the atmosphere is most silent! Then you'll get some heart attacks or other results alike! So keep creating ""real"" accounts and submit positive critics, lying doesn't cost a thing!

First impressions are the budget of the movie and feel they give....complete opposites....for such a shoes string budget they got the real money's worth in the output. It has the paranormal activity+Poltergeist combo without the regular Hollywood treatment of cheesy camera work and dialog....its fresh and good back to basic horror. The leads are convincing, we can immediately step into their shoes.....3rd footwear reference...not intentional...its just the flow. What is really good - the chill-thrill, music, camera work and focus on main story, no deviation. Watch out for hidden stuff allover the movie, clues...and references and any sneaky stuff that moves.

The movie looked old, like it was filmed in the 80s and while all the kiddies in the movie jumped and screamed, nobody left there truly scared...or excited about seeing a quality movie. For hardcore horror movie fans, this movie is a DEFINITE no!!!!! Rite was much better and it's jump scenes actually did make me jump! REALLLLLLLY disappointed!

It felt like watching a half developed remake of ""Poltergeist"" ""follow my voice"" ""come into the light Carol Ann"" Granted, there are a few jumpy scenes if you're the ""jumpy"" type but in no way shape or form would i call this a great horror movie.

605,fionainns,Worth a watch,7,29 April 2011,"Expecting an old fashion 'style' haunted house movie and that's what the first half was - great suspense, fabulous score and lots of 'jumpy' moments. The second half becomes more 'fantasy' horror with ghouls more than ghosts but in places it's just as scary playing to fears with dolls and puppets. There are also a few 'nods' to Saw as this film shares James Wan as director so look out for those. The end is probably a little bit drawn out (maybe 10 minutes longer than necessary) but the final scene is actually quite good. I didn't leave feeling disappointed although I would've preferred more 'haunted' and less 'demons'. The performances were good and solid, particularly from Patrick Wilson (underrated in my opinion) and Rose Byrne as well as the from the kids. It's worth a watch, and was pretty well received from the 3 out of 4 of us who went today.",Insidious
606,lonedreameryaoi,When a good horror forgets its own plot,6,6 June 2011,"For Insidious they took a really good movie and half way through lost the plot and stuck a different movie on the end. The first half and the second just didn't match, they would have made two different films but together they'll didn't blend well and it fell into the American trap of showing too much and completely nullifying the scare factor. Let's talk about the good, the film starts using classic horror scoring even the font for the title is old styled. It's like watching the horror films of the 1930's imagine the font and music of Nosferatu. This older scoring makes for a classic eerie atmosphere, it's an unnatural music with sharp sounds great for creating an unfamiliar and unsettled environment. It really works in the films favour as it does make this house feel haunted and creepy; you don't trust it and you already feel like something bad is in the house. Now the first half sets up the haunting and some of the things you need for a horror film. We have an imposing house that already feels ominous; the camera angles also make the house seem unfriendly giving us unusual views of the staircase and shoots of locked doors. Add to the mix the young family, new home 3 young children one still an infant in the crib, a new job, the pressure of motherhood and working from home, an unfamiliar area and the isolation you get as an adult when you move to a new area and only have each other. This all leads to added anxiety for the characters and us as the audience who begin to emphasize with their growing concern and apprehension about their new life. So everything is set up nicely for a good horror film as the characters are already under a lot of pressure which makes for a nice tense atmosphere to add a haunting. And this they do well with a subtle build-up of books moving but no one see's how or when, a strange voice on the baby monitor and some really good jumps. I was well on my way to feeling truly unsettle and had given myself a heart attack at the jumps. I soon started hiding behind my hand and decided that this film was a bad idea because I was freaked out. This is a great example of a haunted house film coupled with the growing anxiety of these parents. Before long one of the sons is lured into the attic another source of fear and has a fall, next day he is in a coma. We don't know the reasons and soon its 3 months later, mother is getting more and more freaked out in her home and father is spending more time away from home unable to help his wife. Things begin to come to a head as it becomes apparent that something in the house wants our comatose youth and its getting closer so our mother finally convinces her husband to move house. As soon as we get into the new house the wife starts seeing ghosts which are a little too real looking for me. This is where the great atmosphere of the first half is ruined and the film takes things too far. Here's where the film goes bad and wrong. They call in the Ghostfacers (if you've seen the show Supernatural you'll know what I mean) they act like the comedy double act of the ghost hunting world and while its works for a little while, you are lulled into a false sense of security by the comedy and then something jumps out at you, it goes too far and then they call in the exorcist. Now it all goes wrong, OK the exorcist seeing that it's a demon haunting the son trying to steal his body that's fine but it just didn't work. We get all the back story and a stupid plot about astro-projection and our little boy lost in a place called the Farther, his soul is lost and now ghosts are trying to take his body and worse than that this demon. It turns out that good old dad was an astro-projector and when he was young a creepy old women stalked him getting closer (as revealed in a selection of secret photo's his mum kept). Somehow creepy woman didn't run off with his body, dad has forgotten this and now it's up to him to remember his power and project into this nightmare world to save his son and escape the demon. It just gets plan silly now, old woman exorcist puts on a gas mask with a weird trunk and does some odd séance that looks ridicules. And then Darth Maul appears, I'm not even joking you see his face once in the normal world and I jumped like crazy but then we meet him in crazy ghost world he's fully revealed and just not scary if you've seen the recent Star Wars movies. The astro Farther scene just plays out too much we explore all these ghosts that we know nothing about, they're not needed it just bulks out a storyline that is running away with itself. Then we enter an area that looks like the VIP area of a night club mixed with the Phantom of the Opera's lair. Just to make things weird we see that Darth Maul is a bit of a carnival fan, loves an old record spinning on a classic turn table does Darth Maul. By now we've seen the big bad in all its glory the film is pretty much over for me as its way to obvious and just not scary watching this CGI demon chase our characters around the place trying to get back to their bodies. The film does try to have a quirky twist, one that they flash back to about 5mins after we saw it, but it's just not enough to save a failed second half.",Insidious
607,harris-kent-deadmau5,The perfect horror flick.,9,9 July 2011,"This movie was without a doubt one of the best horror films I have seen this year. When I read that the makers of Saw and Paranormal Activity were releasing this film I wasn't really expecting much as both these movies seemed to lack the main horror elements for me. (Personal opinion of course.) I was not scared by neither Saw or Paranormal Activity, but Insidious created something completely different for me and for most of the other viewers as I have heard. Insidious was a very thrilling film with many scenes that made me jump just a little. As a big horror movie fan I am quick to criticise movies by the way they portray or ghost or a demon as such. In Insidious (if you have seen the movie, don't worry, I am not giving much away), we come in to contact with numerous ghosts and demons from another world which are all different. This brought something new to the table as we are not always seeing the cliché ghost or the cliché demon. The plot in this movie was quite a good one and differentiated from normal haunting stories. The acting was a lot better than I expected it to be also. Towards the end of the film the movie got a little out of hand you could say, but I won't give too much away. The ending was also quite enjoyable and was a rememberable twist, not one to forget straight away.",Insidious

However, after these 20 minutes are up, you might as well turn off your TV because what comes after is just ridiculous. I know people say this film is terrifying and that it doesn't use slasher film elements to be scary, but come on! A man with a poorly painted red face as the antagonist is just laughable.I even found myself laughing at the horrendous acting.. I mean to say that if I came into my son's room and his bed and all the furniture was scattered and broken and there was a bloody hand print on the sheet, I wouldn't just breath heavily and look a little flustered like the parents in this movie. I would be absolutely terrified.. same goes for when the mother sees the man walk through her bedroom in the first house.Regarding ""The Further"" and the ridiculous walk through the father goes through to get his son back, this just proves that Insidious gets worse as it progresses. I watched, daring to believe that this is what people regarded as ""a terrifying movie."" If you are a true horror fan, do not see this pathetic attempt at a horror movie.

I watched it with a group of friends and we all screamed so much. It's very jumpy straight from the start and the music, although slightly cliché, adds greatly to the intensity throughout.I have seen many frightening films similar to this such as Paranormal Activity, Night of the Demons and many others that were made for a similar affect but this was by far the scariest I've seen! I really think this should have been rated higher than PG-13 though, I'm 15 which is the English rating for this film and I found it extremely disturbing. I strongly advise against young children seeing this. Although there's not any strong gore or violence I think the disturbing and very jumpy scenes are enough to terrify people of any age.

But if you take my advice, don't close your eyes or even ears, because this movie is a treat to watch. And if you can watch this movie with your eyes open all the time, then i bet you can watch almost 90% of other horror movies because they are no way close to Insidious.

That's not true, and being only 12, even I didn't find it that scary. The scariest part of it was probably all the devil things, and the fact that it may happen to you, and it makes you jump like 2 or 3 times.The thing I like about it is that its one of them movies where you have to think about and figure out whats going on. The ending just freaked me out, I have to say. You think everything is going to be okay, it's all sorted, everyone's happy, when BAM, something happens.I didn't really get the meaning at first and i had to look it up on google and read a couple of reviews.* SPOILERS * Well, this is what the movie is basically about and what it means, please don't read if you haven't seen it yet.Well a little boy called Dalton falls down a ladder and goes into a coma the next day, but the doctors don't detect any damage done to the brain. The parents take Dalton home, and the mum keep seeing things such as demons and ghosts, but the dad can't see any of it. They end up moving house because the mum gets too freaked out, but weird things keep happening in the new house as well, such as a little boy running around and a room getting completely trashed.Later on, some ghost-buster people and a lady come in to help them, and it turns out that Dalton is an able astral projector and he went too far away from his body, into a place full of them devils.During the movie we also find out that the dad never likes his pictures taken, and that he keeps seeing a devil woman in his dreams, who also appears in pictures of him , closer and closer each time.The only way to get Dalton back is for the dad to go and astral project him self. He goes to get Dalton who does back into his body.What we see at the end is the dad coming back to his body just when the devils are about to reach it, and wakes up. Everything seems to be fine, but all of a sudden the old woman snaps a picture of the dad, who goes crazy and chokes her to death. Later on, the mum comes into the room and looks at the picture, and instead of the dad being there, there is the devil woman that kept appearing in all of the other pictures was there all on her own.What I think it means is that the devil woman was trying to take control of the dads physical body and in the end she got into it, which means it was still his physical body, but the spirit was the devil woman.The old woman could probably sense the spirit in him, and took a picture to make sure.. Well that's about it , 7/10 for the movie overall",Insidious

The movie is predictable. I really wanted to find a strength in the movie, but I can't think of any besides the story/concept.

The only ""scares"" were jump scares, which don't count because that's being startled, not scared. The ""demon"" was hilarious. When I first saw it I thought of Darth Maul. Terrible CGI when he walks on the wall. The movie was only an hour and 45 minutes but it felt longer than that because I wanted it to end.

Insidious Name itself is so scary i loved the experience on a Blu Ray Rose Byrne is so cute Its a must watch ..!! That wicked background music is so evil its real scary.Its advisable to watch it in daylight because its a real scary fright night u will get shivers in some scenes that is the camera is moving in the living room and all of a sudden something appears and the music is like a explosion and it gives you a mini heart attack .I hope you all enjoy it",Insidious

I thought this film showed promise, the trailer seemed scary and then to find out it was created by the two great minds ( i use that term loosely after seeing this film) that brought us two great films ( saw and paranormal activity) this one would be great, suspenseful and possibly gory? Boy was I wrong! It was predictable, the performances where stilted, some of the line deliveries looked like read throughs. It started okay and that's being kind it steadily, no wait, it nose dived off a cliff so fast I could feel the wind in my hair as I watched the screen. I am searching for a reason to recommend to see this movie... wait I got it, if you had the choice between having your limbs chopped off while listening to the latest Justin Bieber album on repeat and watching as people throw themselves off a building (on fire) or watching this film then I would say watch it.

This movie is so bad I'm not even going to go into fine detail, I wouldn't waste my time. The only thing this movie has going for is the scene of the demon, which I thought was pretty creative.Trying to sit through the cringe-worthy ""dramas"" of the poor kid and even poorer acting made me feel like they put zero effort into casting and just threw together the first people that seemed interested. I wouldn't even class this as a B movie, or a C. This shouldn't have gone anywhere near cinema or DVD, this horrible waste of time and money should have gone straight onto free-to-air TV at 3am where barely anyone would get to see it.I honestly don't know how the producers of such a great series (Saw) thought this would work.Avoid it unless you love being disappointed.",Insidious
619,costigan95-712-931904,Some Good Scares...,6,14 June 2013,"I watched this film for the first time recently after hearing good things. I had previously viewed Sinister and was told that Insidious was a similar type of scary. Although the film has some great scream and goose bump inducing moments I felt that the second half and specifically the climax were lacking. The film started off presenting the viewer with some genuinely scary imagery and moments but into the later parts of the film it began to become, in my opinion, silly. (Minor Spoilers Follow) In the climax of the film, I thought the ""Netherworld"" sequence was not very scary and actually took some of the fear away from the movie. The fire faced entity was more laughable than scary. The Final scene of the movie offered a good twist but could not make up for what was a disappointing climax to the film. I hope the upcoming sequel can improve upon this ones mistakes. P.S. If you are looking for a very scary film that is also very good then I would recommend Sinister. Enjoy",Insidious

Have you ever seen a film so creepy you can't stop shaking for hours? This is one such film. Many have lauded the cinematography and I must give praise as well.The concept, not too out of the ordinary, however, it has a much more concrete twist if you will about it.To me, not only were the images immensely disturbing and frightening, the whole idea of what was happening did me in the most.When people think of haunted houses and ghost it is fuzzy, beyond us. This film eerily made the concept of apparitions plausible almost scientifically.Listen to what is said carefully and think about especially when it comes to the how and why.See this film. Please do not see it if you have health issues. I'm healthy and usually am like a typical man and don't get scared easily (except for psychological films like Event Horizon).This movie made me scream out loud in panic.",Insidious
621,ben-korn,Finally,7,13 July 2014,"It has been very well documented over the past 10/15 years that there has been a distinct lack of genuinely frightening films with the horror industry relying more and more heavily on sequels and remakes. And although that there has been some standout films from places such as Europe and Asia with titles such as ""Ring"" and ""The orphanage"", America has seen a noticeable drop in the quality of horror films, although once again with some exceptions such as the ""Saw"" films, ""Orphan"" and ""Cabin Fever. However with the help of brilliant and very underrated director ""James Wan"" horror seems to be making a slight comeback. Insidious has almost everything that i believe makes a film scary, a good amount of jump scares, good tension build-up throughout and a very well made soundtrack and although there is little violence within this film it is neither needed to make the film scary or necessary to the story. The direction of this film is very good with some interesting shot choices and good use of panning and zoom. The actors also managed to do their job very well with some excellent performances from Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne who play the parents in the film, Josh and Renai Lambert. There are very few criticisms i can make about his films the biggest being that the main antagonist in this film is built up to be very scary and simply isn't, also towards the end of the film there are some slight plot holes, however neither of these things manage to ruin the overall atmosphere and brilliance of this film. This is a must watch for any horror fan but definitely not for the faint hearted.",Insidious

There are so many being churned out at the moment, a lot which just go straight to DVD. They can be made on the cheap and generate a decent profit for that reason.I saw Insidious today and thought it was very refreshing. It is incredibly bold in the way that it plays with the genre. In the beginning we're led to believe that this is just one of your average, straight-up haunted house flicks, but as the film progresses, it takes many twists and turns. It seemed to touch on the Sci-fi genre a bit as well, which I thought was brilliant. This could've ended up being quite hokey, but the screenplay is well written and the lines are delivered believably, although some people seem to have an issue with the acting. I also thought the score was superb, very old school. Finally a score which is substantial in the mix, like the good old days.I can understand why some may not like it, as it challenges conventions and expectations, but surely we need new films to be doing just that?

627,greiner3,And I thought Tiny Tim was scary BEFORE this movie.,3,8 April 2011,"The summary pretty much sums up my thoughts on this remake of so many of the similar genre that have come before this;Poltergiest was both funnier and scarier. It's lead actors had a much better presence than these two and where is the movie making 'they're here!' line. Even the remake, a dud, was worth seeing when compared with this entry.Rosemary's Baby had a more believable premise than 'astral projection.'Even some of the bad, and there are more in this category than good, Stephen King film adaptations have better acting, scripts and plot twists.I am of the firm belief that the entire genre, horror movies, needs a disclaimer 'DANGER junk science within.' For sheer schlock entertainment and a way to kill an hour and a half you could do worse but as a way to win your date's heart and more you might do well to listen to her advice and go to that romantic comedy she suggested.",Insidious
628,wusel,cheap thrills,1,6 July 2011,"Insidious is a typical b-product from the scary movie genre. Its story is a collection of clichés from the Japanese horror wave of the past decade and the American remakes thereof. Haunted house et cetera.It is a sure sign of poor writing skills when a movie has characters sitting around explaining the plot for minutes on end, and this movie has a lot of that. An awful lot. This is exacerbated by the fact that the audience arrives at every major conclusion about 30 minutes before the characters do, and the predictability of the plot should even make the end quite unsurprising for the average viewer.The dismal and dreary visual style is actually not a bad choice for the subject and some of the photography was quite agreeable, but the editing and overall feel of it seemed a bit much like a television production. The acting was below average and the two geeks were nice distraction though they were clearly under-used.Due to the total lack of atmosphere, Insidious relies heavily on the over-use of cheap thrills like creaking doors, creepy or sudden music or noises and suddenly appearing ghosts and demons. Just like the haunted house at the local funfair. Yes, it will scare you for a moment, but you will call it a rip-off at the exit nonetheless. Some scenes that were clearly meant to provide suspense were even involuntary funny and laughed at by the audience.The only thing that really scared me is that so many users proved to have obviously never seen a really good movie by rating this stinker at an insane 7.0 and nearly half a million people like it on facebook. I personally rate this movie a miserable failure.",Insidious

633,angelusemre,James Wan and Leigh Whannel are the best thing that happened to this genre!,9,27 June 2011,"First of all, movie was fantastic. It's been a really long time that i saw a movie this scary. Totally worth your money and your time.James Wan and Leigh Whannel simply knows how to create the atmosphere. We saw that ability in the first installment of ""Saw"". Leigh is a very good writer and James Wan simply knows to make that script come alive.Nowadays, horror movies are all about bad scripts, bad acting and lots of special effects. And of course there are movies like ""Paranormal Activity"" done with low budget and wants to scare us with their so- called realism. This movie is also like the old horror movies. Especially the music sounds like very old like ""The Exorcist"" and stuff, but i really liked it. Sound effects were really god, for example, the ""BAM!"" effect not comes with the scary visual, James Wan wants to take your time to see it for yourself, than he hits the sound effects and take the scene to a whole new level. First hour of the film is really slow, but it's also good to create the atmosphere and get to know our characters. Second hour is the best. It's like an unstoppable mind-blowing scary movie. I think that James Wan and Leigh Whannel keeps this genre alive. They respect the works of Wes Crawen, John Carpenter and all the other masters. Also they are very aware of what they're doing, and they're aware of the power they have. So, they're coming to scare and surprise us once again. It's not a thriller like ""Saw"" but it's not a empty teen horror movie either. It's a good horror flick that worth seeing.",Insidious

In other words, the loudness makes you jump, not the content. What did make me laugh, however, was Lin Shaye's appearance as Elise Rainier, the ""psychic"" slash expert on ""the further"". All I could think of when I saw her was her role as the landlady in ""King Pin"", ugh.I did not enjoy this movie at all. I watched it because the review on IMDb was high compared to most psychological thrillers, but I now know better than to trust user reviews.

I told him, ""it means something wicked inside but looks good outside.""

Now at the end of the movie there was a literally insidious thing. I did not expect too much about this film, I just thought it was a regular house-haunting movie, but the second half of this movie was more than I had imagined.

The guy who wrote the script doesn't know what an astral projection means, he doesn't know if haunting or possessing has anything to do with it, it looks to me he had a nice conversation with an old bored lady at the tobacco store and he made a script out of it.

Every chance to win me over was quickly dashed with awful executions of what were good if not great ideas. If I was to rate the concept of this movie I would give it an 8/10 but, as a whole 4/10 is more appropriate. I was especially disappointed in the effects, the scene where all the spirits are coming for his body reminded me of why I dislike most old zombie movies.

645,ianlionheart,Had the potential to be great,5,20 March 2012,"I've been keeping myself away from horror movies and such since I usually always end up being disappointed. Insidious did however intrigue me, and I've been wanting to see it ever since I was at a screening with my girlfriend and Saw Horrible bosses. The director James Wan has previously impressed me with titles such as Saw, Dead silence (not that good, but a classic itself), and thusly decided to rent the movie and watch it. The haunted houses and questionable children is something that have been recycled throughout many many movies, but if they still work and impress in this day and age, It's usually a mixture of both visuals and the actors talent.The movie actually impressed me, as I found it to be really really good the first seventy minutes or so, with no trace of Hollywood destroying the movie; something I've seen and experienced with many movies that could've been great (Gothika, Drag me to hell, Silent hill, you name them).However.. as soon as Josh (played by Patrick Wilson) is about to travel to ""the further"" I knew I was up for a major disappointment. When you build a foundation for a horror movie that based on a recycled idea and actually pull it off, make it interesting and make the jumpy moments innovating and actually ""new"" to the genre, it's NOT a great idea to destroy the last thirty minutes of the movie by having one of the characters in the movie fight a ghost with terrible cgi effects. It's not a great idea to have one of the demons crawl across a wall with once again, crappy cgi effects. It's further not really bright to squeeze in various demons and ghosts into a closet and make a terrible attempt at scaring the audience in a manner that probably wouldn't even scare a twelve-year-old.The movie piled up, and simply became too much. It felt really rushed towards the end, and turned from being a perfectly enjoyable and intriguing psychological jumpy horror flick to being something that Hollywood (once again) completely destroyed. Since I actually enjoyed the first seventy minutes one might think that 5/10 is somewhat unfair. I do however not. I tend to remember the final moments of a movie; those are the one that usually sticks with me, and if they in one way or another destroy what the movie has been trying to achieve I almost always end up unimpressed.",Insidious

Of course, some films need it. But then, does it really have to be this stupid. Astroreality or whatever...what a stupid idea.I strongly recommend to watch this film as long as ""astrolady"" appears.

Which one?Mr. X says, InsidiousMr. Y says, Oh! that horror movie?Mr. X says, Yeah, scary one.Mr. Y says, That is why I haven't watched it.Mr. X says, It's scary.Mr. Y says, I think so. I want to watch it too but I'm scared.Mr. X says, Don't watch it. I didn't watch the screen when something scary was going to happen he he. I just looked away from the screen and watched it back when intense and scary scenes relieved, but gradually I got into it at later half and dared to watch it.Mr. Y says, Did you watch it alone? Or were there others watching with you?Mr. X says, No, I watched it alone. The ghosts are not that scary but the thrills are unexpected and it is a scary story too. There are some scenes which are really frightening.Mr. Y says, I'll watch it during daytime.Mr. X says, OK but don't be too scared, it'll scare you more.Mr. Y says, Hmm.Mr. X says, For a relief, the ghosts are not so scary, but when they appear, they thrill you good. But once you know the ghosts, you'll be less scared.Mr. Y says, OK.Mr. X says, But watch it during daytime.Mr. Y says, Yeah.Mr. X says, Try to look the ghosts in funny way, they'll make you laugh may be. Don't put so much scare in your head while watching this movie.Mr. Y says, OK.Mr. X says, Some ghosts are funny looking too. You might laugh later after movie. Just don't build up the scare too much. I had too much hype coz I read some reviews which claimed it was really scary.Mr. Y says, No but even the trailer is scary.Mr. X says, He he. You might be really frightened for the first half hour or more. But as I said if you are scared, it'll scare you more. It's a good horror movie after all.",Insidious
653,feathers7676,Very disappointing!,2,25 April 2011,"Having read some of the positive reviews here I thought this movie would be scary. I kind of had a bad feeling though as the opening credits rolled (but I stuck with it). The moment the ghost boy started dancing it became apparent this movie was trying very hard to be scary but FAILING in a big way. It went downhill from there really. A 50's biker ghost with gelled black hair, a phantom menace style red face painted demon, and later we had what seemed to be an attempt to imitate Stanley Kubrick's SHINING style by introducing a scene where a few 1930's era ghosts sit on a couch and another ghost stood beside them with an ironing board (ghostly whistling could be heard but no lips were moving). This scene was supposed to be really scary but failed because it looked so out of place and the ghost makeup was just plain bad (the creepy smiles on the faces of the ghosts were just plain sad).A previous reviewer stated that the acting was superb... I suspect that person was either a friend of the director or had exceptionally low expectations. The acting right from early on struck me as being somewhat inept. The characters were poorly developed and you didn't really engage with them emotionally. You didn't know enough about this family to really care one way or the other.When the ghost hunters were introduced, it became clear this movie didn't know exactly what it wanted to be (serious ghost movie or farcical comedy?) You see the ghost hunters were intended to bring comedy relief into what was supposedly an otherwise 'scary' movie. This failed because these two nerdy investigators were also lacking in decent script lines. The attempts at humour from the two techie ghost-hunter nerds failed as dismally as the movie did to scare.I would class this as D-movie (it falls way below the level of competence needed to create a B-movie). The 'D' represents Dismal.My advice to you would be to ignore any favourable reviews and give this movie a miss. Unless of course you like watching D-movies? I can recommend a much better low budget horror: Death of a Ghost Hunter (the end scene in particular kind of sticks with you and makes you reflect).If you want truly scary horrors then look to the Asian ones like SHUTTER (not the American remake).",Insidious
654,gpeddie,"Not as scary as expected, but still a good story",6,6 September 2011,"From the start, everyone was going crazy over this film. Everyone says that this was the scariest movie they've ever seen. I thought it would be the same when I first rented this. I was quickly disappointed from the beginning. It may have been different if the credits didn't take so long to go through. The title in the beginning looked like it was from the '80s. That's not the only problem I have with this movie.There were a lot of things that I feel, if they were changed, would have been scarier. The music is just a bunch of broken violins that aren't good on the ears. They made the movie too predictable.One bright spot, was Tiny Tim's appearance. Didn't make much sense, but seemed to fit nicely. If you are a horror freak, maybe you will enjoy this. For anyone who has told you this was the scariest movie ever, that's going a little too far. All in all, it was great story to follow with a nice twist ending. A few modifications, this could've been much better.",Insidious
655,k_buck4,Truly Horrifying,10,25 July 2011,"After seeing the trailer for the movie, I really wanted to see it in hopes that it would be a truly scary movie, unlike many movies that have come out in the past few years that are not at all scary. After watching this movie, all I can say is this: I have never been more scared in my life. The movie does a wonderful job in getting the audience genuinely terrified. While many films put a few scary moments throughout the film and leave the rest of the movie to be used for ""build up"" to an ultimately un-horrifying moment, Insidious is pretty much back to back terror. While the ending of the movie can petty much be seen coming, and there are a few moments where the acting in the movie lags a bit, the overall feel of Insidious is one of true terror. The film is by far one of the best (if not THE best) PG-13 horror movie to date. Don't watch if you are not ready to scream!",Insidious
656,clocksnmirrors-932-761321,Even scared a jaded movie veteran like me!,8,14 February 2014,"I've been watching horror movies for years and not much scares me anymore, so I was delighted to finally reconnect with that primal uneasiness I used to experience.Insidious genuinely scared me. I'm glad I watched it during the day on DVD. I actually paused the movie to let my jangled nerves settle down.What this movie did well was to build tension and then zap me. It was like walking around the house in socks on a dry winter day. You know the static is building up. You know you're going to get shocked when you touch metal. You anticipate it, and when that zap happens the anticipation adds to the pain. This movie did a lot of zapping! In the horror genre it's hard to be completely original. Here we have another family being haunted. A child is in danger. The mother is the first to believe. The father is skeptical. An old lady expert is called in to fix the problem. There's really nothing new there.This movie wins with execution. It's the right pace of storytelling. It's the right sound editing. It's believable acting (for the most part). It's the right look for the otherworldly beings.Don't expect perfection, though. Once they knew what the problem was, the way they set about resolving it took me out of the mood set during the first part of the movie. Eyes were rolled. Nevertheless, the overall experience left me with a lingering sense of unease.I'm glad someone figured out how to put this all together. I've been waiting years to feel this way again. Well done!",Insidious

I'll watch anything from slasher to monster. This one was like nothing I have ever seen. I don't want to give away spoilers i'm just letting you know whatever you think this movies gonna be about, it's not. Beautifully shot, good acting, good direction, great story, scared the crap out of me and had an ending I have been praying for since I started watching horror films when I was a kid. I'll be honest Paranormal activity scared me. There is some Paranormal activity moments in this movie that made me jump but that's not the whole point of the movie. Don't be thinking it is. Also its from the dude that directed the first saw. There is not blood and guts galore either, just a well thought out crazy awesome story that will have you leaving the theater feeling satisfied and ready to tell all of your friends and co workers to go out and see it.",Insidious
658,tannerwilson36,Scariest movie of the decade?,10,29 April 2011,"So i saw insidious, and i gotta say, this is the scariest movie i've seen since paranormal activity, if not, scarier. The reason for insidious being scarier than the masterpiece, paranormal activity, is because the subtle scares, detailed demons, and truly scary situations. Insidious is just like the older movie, Poltergeist, only MUCH better. Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne both play excellent roles in being worried parents, and very dramatic characters. The ending is truly interesting, the musical score was excellent, the acting was superb, i mean, what is there bad to say about this movie? Go see it as soon as you get the chance, its truly excellent, and very scary.",Insidious
659,shairin,Not your average horror. Wait. Not a horror.,9,20 October 2013,"Hello people of IMDb! This is my first review, after reading that this movie barely got a 6/10. Let's go. I am not a horror type. I tend to avoid horror movies, unless they can teach me something. The story has to be solid, and the characters has to be credible. I loved The Ring, I adore IT (even if it's born as a book)and recently I enjoyed The Woman in Black, and The Awakening. I consider myself an open-minded guy. If something ""may be"" like that, I agree with you. If something seems impossible, I think it's possible. If you say ""why"" I answer ""why not"".I've been suggested to watch Insidious. And so I did. Insidious it's not a horror movie. Insidious is a spiritual movie. A lesson movie. Insidious tells you ""there's this, and this. You may take it as pure fiction and keep eating your popcorn until the credits, or you can actually believe"". You can actually understand that the world we live in is not ours only. We live in an energy world. A world full of spirit. We possess the spirit, but we are not the only one. We are not the only living beings here. Or anyway, not on this level. And if you venture further and further into the ""other"" levels, you may lose yourself, and what you will find... you may not like it. So, in all honesty, if you're going to watch Insidious just as a horror movie, you'll have your share of jumps, but that's it. If you're going to watch Insidious as a lesson, you'll learn a lot. Trust me.",Insidious
660,mm7715,Poor second rate Poltergeist knockoff,3,23 September 2011,"Insidius is a second rate Poltergeist knockoff. The lead characters, just like in poltergeist are trying to bring their kid back from a type of spirit realm except this one's not stuck in a TV. I was hoping to see a movie with substance and an edge of the seat grip, I was sadly disappointed. The movie opens slow and stays slow for the first 35 minutes. Over dramatic Elmer Bernstein style scary music is used to try to make up for the lack of actual scariness. The story line twists and turns in downward spiral of hilarious scary characters including the heavy grease painted red faced character and some others that waddle like leprechauns. I couldn't stomach anymore beyond where they brought in the old lady and turned it off. If you watch this movie you'll be wasting time that you can never get back!",Insidious
661,dennyayden,Scariest Movie I've seen in a long time... Halloween worthy!,6,24 April 2011,"I think this movie had a good story-line. Definitely some jumpy moments and freaky stuff going on. I especially loved the add-in of Barbara Hershey (From 1982 THE ENTITY) and the historic references. The only thing that turned me off was the near ending. I was good with the premise of a Happy ending. I could have even dealt with a twist, but I didn't like the choke-kill of a certain character (no spoiler) and that's where it all went down hill... But overall well done and worth the price of admission. Good acting, some hokey laughable stuff, on-the- edge-of-your-seat moments and Ghost Busters to the rescue! A must see on the big screen. If not, then make sure the lights are out. I advise a dark room with a candle burning for the full effect.",Insidious
662,jonardk,laughable,4,14 May 2011,"I'm really surprised to see this film is averaging 7.2 at the moment. The film took an eternity to actually get into with the opening 30 minutes of the film a constant cycle of the mundane daily routine of the family affected. The concept of the film doesn't work and seems like a cheesy attempt of a children's bedtime horror. I waited an eternity for a proper scary moment, but it completely failed to deliver this. It also seemed to combine pieces of other films most notably the 'fire demon' seeming Freddie Krugeresque and the start of the film seeming liking paranormal activity. Acting is poor, concept is poor, dialogue is poor. Film is a bore from start to finish. If you want a scary film avoid this at all costs..",Insidious

After Poltergeist 1982 (the only spooky yet horror film ever leave the scary effect on me so far), this is the next horror film manage to do the same. The story might be a bit slow on the beginning (but not that slow), but it's picking up after the first 30 min. I can go on watching this film even if it's play for more than 2 hours! Good enough to make me wanting for more. Love the idea of different kind of horror. I'm not a coward person for all that I know but this movie had made me scared, scared enough to make me ask my husband to accompany me to the toilet, thumbs up! But not recommended for younger audience since the entire film from begin to end is scary, might be disturbing for some kids. Gonna watch it again!",Insidious

I couldn't wait to see this movie, the trailer (always showing the best A mix between Paranormal Activity and Drag Me To Hell The beginning of the movie - great, I loved it. Real suspense albeit the musical cues warned me what was about to happen.But the second half flopped; it was almost like they got another writer, that's how different it was.Gas mask? It started to decline quickly after that. I started to laugh - she look so funny in it. The Further? - more like those haunted houses you see around Halloween with paid actors. The zombies reaching out to claim their ""victim?"" Silly. Hey, how about those paper mache ""chains"" (here son, let me just rip them apart without any effort!) Fog machine smoke - c'mon. There's more to rant about but I'll stop.The ending - very cool. It was the old lady who was communicating to the medium. What was written on the tablet by specs was exactly what Josh (old lady) said at the end of the movie. In the end (as I see it) Josh becomes possessed!",Insidious
665,randommathatsmeXD,Scariest movie I have seen in my life!!,10,8 May 2011,"***CAUTION MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS!*** Well, where can I start? The effects, costume, house set and music played a huge part in the movie for me. I can easily say this movie made me jump around 20 times (and I was actually counting!) and I actually screamed at one point. Most of the theatre/cinema had either their hands over their eyes or over their mouths or ears. In my case, I had my hands over my eyes and ears. I was slumped so far down in my seat that after the movie I couldn't get up and had to ask my friends for help. At the first jump, and right at the end of the movie, there were a few 'nervous' laughs and someone was crying at the back. I could honestly say I walked out of that cinema with jelly legs from being so shaky. All the way from start to finish it scared the living hell out of me and when I got home I jumped at everything I saw or heard and hid behind a cushion with my dog until my mum came to bed at 12pm. The old woman and the twins with the freaky smiles scared me the most. I don't think i'll be watching it for a while now... And this is a lot coming from me as I have watched practically everything, even for my age! So as a wrap -up, I strongly advise you to not watch the film on your own and don't watch it at all if you are faint-hearted or have heart problems- it's truly jumpy. And if you are under the age certificate, PLEASE try not to watch it until you get older as it will EASILY give you nightmares for a week. Just remember,don't be fooled by the low age certificate.",Insidious
666,outlaw1990,Finally something that's actually scary!,8,13 May 2011,"Going into this film, I didn't set the bar very high. I was expecting the same predictable horror junk thats been playing in theaters for a long time. Everyone knows what I mean; unnecessarily graphic scenes, bad music, underdeveloped characters, etc. However, I was pleasantly surprised by Insidious. This movie is a serious improvement from the filmmakers' previous work, (Paranormal Activity, Saw)which I found very dull. Insidious has all the good elements of classic horror; characters that the viewers sympathize with, dramatic music, and a build up of tension that will make your skin crawl. The plot is engaging and reaches its climax with out dragging. I was also very happy that the script was not cheesy, but rather quite real. The entities that are shown in the film are creepy without being ridiculous, and are also not shown too often. The best movie to compare Insidious to is of course Poltergeist. While the plots concern the same issues, Insidious has a more believable story and a darker edge to it.My only complaint is the very end of the film, which is written almost as if the creators are hinting at a sequel (shudder). The heroic (but very human) father saves the day, only to be corrupted by an evil spirit. I found myself wishing that the family could have a happier ending after all the crap they've been through. Overall, Insidious is a great suspense film- and the only one that scared me in the last ten years.",Insidious

First of all, this movie is not for the young ones. It contains very dark, and evil themes that might scare some. The movie is very entertaining and very good. The acting is superb. Everything about this movie is great. Its an old idea put to a new perspective. I would go see this again.

669,jessica-beckett,If you appreciate a great movie.. then Insidious is not for you!,3,19 May 2011,"I decided to see Insidious after a number of friends had told me how 'scary' the film was. I'm a major horror/paranormal fan and couldn't wait to watch Insidious and prepared to be spooked.The film is based along the storyline of a little boy, who is stuck in a 'coma' but is actually discovering a new dimension called 'The Further' in which a demon is slowly but surely trying to possess him.The 'coma' part of this storyline really started to scare me.. but then the storyline became ridiculously over-exaggerated when the audience were then told he was visiting another universe which is run by demons and parasites.The events in the house were scary, such as the scary coincidences that happened.. e.g. the baby monitor and the bangs, doors opening, alarms going off etc, and also the younger brother claiming he was scared when his brother (who is in the coma) walked about the house.However.. the scenes that followed, by trying to contact the demons were not scary, and in fact, I spent most of the time during these scenes laughing at how ridiculous the storyline had become and also the fact that you could then see these demons (which only looked like a very low par costume and mask). The appearance of these 'demons' which seemed to be like mannequin dolls, zombies and 'X-men' type characters did not even remotely scary - but only made me giggle. Friday 13th from 1980 had better costuming.. and this is 2011..The ending was predictable, yet you can't understand why and how it actually happened..The only good point I can make about the movie is that the acting was quite good. What a shame they were made to act in such a mediocre film. It's a shame, because Insidious could have been so much better had it followed the same sort of idea as Paranormal Activity.. demons that are invisible and you can only hear and feel them, which is what I believe most demons to be like.If you want a real spook, dig out your good old fashioned traditional movies such as Friday 13th, The Exorcist, The Exorcism of Emily Rose.. don't waste your time on this film. It's over £20 I can't get back from the cinema that I could have spent on a lot of better movies on Amazon..",Insidious
670,Stuart-sidebottom,in-s(tup)id-ious,1,21 May 2011,"THE term horror has been used in movies for the past 115 years since it's gruesome birth on December, 24 1896 at the Theatre Robert Houdin, France, in the form of Le Manoir Du Diable (The Devils Castle).Since then there have been many classics such as The Exorcist, The Shining and more recently Saw; and horror movies have gone from strength to strength scaring their victim audience even after the movie has finished. So with the added bonus of this film coming from the makers of Paranormal Activity' and Saw; it promised to be a true horror classic.The film starts with teacher Josh (Patrick Wilson) and his composer wife Renai (Rose Byrne) moving their family to a new home where everything seems fine.However, within a few days their oldest son Dalton (Ty Simpkins) has an accident and whilst in a comatose state an evil presence appears to consume the family home.Unfortunately over time many good things eventually come to an end and with the birth of Insidious comes the death of the horror movie. Despite a positive start with plenty of jumpy moments, the film rapidly lost life with the storyline being too far fetched and the director trying too hard to place fear into the audience with ticking clocks and creaking floor boards.The addition of subtle humour that seems to be an ever increasing factor in most modern day horror films was unnecessary and ridiculous props that should be scary only added to the pain of an already agonisingly poor horror film.The movie did have some scary moments with a certain camera scene that builds great suspense and the fear inflicted on the audience when seeing a ghostly face by a baby's cot; and the performances from Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne were very convincing but unfortunately could not save the second half of this film.It also had the typical scenes audiences have now seen over and over again like the voice through the baby monitor when no-one is upstairs; and before long you can predict exactly what is going to happen and how it will all end.For the horror film rookie, this may be a great start for you as things will only get better from here; however, for you veterans out there this will no doubt be the final nail in what was once a terrifying coffin.",Insidious

Two words: Absolutely. Ridiculous. The acting was barely decent and the plot line was very awkward. Around the time Tiny Tim's ""Tiptoe Through the Tulips"" started playing I felt the urge to either laugh at this movie or get up and leave.

Insidious always keeps you on edge and it always seemed to get me once I let my guard down. If something lingered too long, I would relax, and the second I did made me wish I did not. The ending was pretty good because it gives you a sense of accomplishment before taking it away from you within minutes. Very good take on horror flicks like this, I really enjoyed myself and I would most likely see it again.

I even paused the film for some time at a point where i couldn't it anymore. Even The conjuring (from the same director) gets dwarfed here. The mood that is set by the film from the word go is the best part of it. You get the feeling that something is not around you and slowly you tend to feel that you are also a part of it.

Whenever a horror movie can give comedy relief and snatch it away from you directly afterwards. There are many ""easter eggs"" in this movie that you can find if you look around the scene instead of looking directly at the subject. That gave my friends and I a good time as well, rewinding the movie afterwards to find as many as we could. If you look at the chalkboard in the classroom, there is a picture of Jigsaw. You're welcome ;) It didn't get in the way of the movie, and sometimes made it a bit more creepy. But it was still a joke among us. The spirit investigators were also a laughing stock of the movie. The evil spirit we made fun of also. He didn't look scary at all, in fact he sort of looked a bit like Darth Maul. The old woman however, was a bit more scary. Is every freaking evil spirit a pedophile? Even the women. Come on! I had been told by many of my friends that this movie was the scariest movie they have ever seen. The only horror movie I had ever seen was I Am Legend, but I had played a lot of horror games, such as Silent Hill, prior to watching this. So, since I Am Legend wasn't scary at all, I wanted to actually have a scare from a movie. I logged in to Netflix and watched it with a few pals and we were pretty stoked. The only problem is, this movie wasn't really all that scary. It was very predictable as well, I pretty much pointed out everything that would happen before it did. This movie also had a horrible misunderstanding of the astral plane. It got nearly everything wrong. You can come in contact with evil spirits, yes, but can you get possessed by one? No. Can you get lost in the astral plane? No. This is because your spirit is tethered to your body. It would be like having a dock as your body, and a boat tied to the dock as your spirit. If too high of tide ever came in, you could pull yourself right back to the dock. And that's what your spirit does. You can research more about that for yourself, but I found that many people didn't want to even think of about astral travel or lucid dreaming after watching this movie because they were scared this would happen to them. I think it's horrible that they chose to represent the beauty of the astral world in such a horrible, unrealistic manner. I was quite disappointed with that decision. All in all, it was a mediocre movie. It lacked good scares, had too much comic relief in it, too many easter eggs, and a stupid representation of astral travel. However, it was a new, original idea to make a movie about astral travel, much like Inception made a movie about lucid dreaming. I just wish they didn't choose that topic to make a horror movie about, because nearly everything was false!",Insidious
675,tywon,Just when you think the horror genre is dead out comes Insidious,10,28 June 2011,"James Wan (Saw) and Oren Peli (Paranormal Activity) the two people behind two of the most popular horror franchises in recent years deliver a surprising and terrifying movie in an almost dead genre.A family movie into their new house and begins to think it's haunted when their son is put into a coma, parents Josh and Renai struggle to uncover the root of these strange happenings and the stress of the situation begins to take a toll on them as they realize that they are dealing with powers beyond human comprehension.The plot is your run of the mill haunted house story but it's a different take on it, as they soon find out that it's not actually the house that's haunted.Rose Byrne plays the caring mother who will do whatever it takes to get her son back and find the root of evil and Patrick Wilson is the father who doesn't really believe what his wife is saying about the house and just wants things back to to the way they were.The acting is solid especially Byrne and Wilson who are always good and I really liked the different take on the haunted house story but the best part of the movie is just how terrifying it is, I was on the edge of my seat all the way through well apart from a few times where I jumped out of my seat scared to death, the movie left me with nightmares.

It starts with a family of two parents with two young boys and a baby girl. They move into this house that isn't your standard haunted house, it actually looked quite nice! While the family is getting used to their new home, young Dalton, one of the sons, decides to have a look in the attic after the door opens ""on its own"". He tries to turn on a light, but falls in the process, but is there something else in there. He starts to scream and mum and dad come to the rescue, but the next day he falls into a ""coma"" with no apparent cause. Soon strange things happen around the house that could well be affecting Dalton and the other children.Now, I thought the writing in this film was brilliant! It delivered a great, scary horror with a great story, which is hard to come by these days, with most going all story no scare or all scare no story. The latter being most common. The characters are well developed, you start to care for them. The action starts straight away with a cheap but brilliant opening sequence! Even the ""demons"" are well made and are all extremely unique, from the ""fire demon"" to the ""dancing boy"". And what an ending!The first half of the film is very suspenseful but does not make you want to look away from the screen, it makes you freeze, in fear of looking away and seeing fire face! The jump scares are not cheap at all and are delivered brilliantly.Overall, this is a brilliant scare-fest for those who want a bit of story with their heart attack.",Insidious
677,Mr_Grieves94,Biggest Disappointment of a Movie I've Seen in a While,4,18 July 2011,"Now, I don't have a lot of experience with horror movie, because I don't see how grotesque dismemberment is entertaining or actually scary. So, I loved the ghost story style horror of the Paranormal series, because they were at least trying. You can imagine I was excited to hear about a new Paranormal-esque movie. After watching, however, I was sorely disappointed. The first half of the movie had some of the best, unnerving scares I've ever seen and for that I recommend it. I don't want to spoil anything and its not a big revelation, but I did say only the first half was good; as soon as you hear the phrase ""astro-projections"" turn it off. After a certain point in the movie it just gets awful and hard to watch. It pretty much turned into a low-budget rip off of Legendary.",Insidious

679,xxredfootxx,Entertaining and definitely above what passes as average nowadays,6,4 January 2012,"A family of five - including two boys and a baby girl - have just moved into their new home. They attempt to settle in and go about their lives until one morning the father discovers the eldest boy, Dalton, has slipped into a coma; doctors are baffled by his condition. Whilst he is tended to in his home, the family begin to experience strange goings-on in the house.This is the premise for Insidious; a modern horror that makes a solid attempt to deliver a haunted house film reminiscent of Poltergeist and the likes. It opens with a suitably creepy scene in which the camera pans from room to room in a house whilst all sleep, following a foreboding silhouette in a window until fixing upon the figure of an old woman. This really sets the tone for what is to come and draws the viewer right in. What follows in the next hour-and-a-half is pretty much what this film's audience will be expecting but the results are still well executed; the shocks put in place throughout the course of the film are generally well timed and many of them genuinely make the skin crawl regardless of whether or not it's something you're likely to have seen before in a film.Whilst the climax may be a bit generic and will therefore likely disappoint some, it's a decent enough pay-off if all you want is to be entertained. I personally thought it worked and felt natural in context with all the events leading up to it. If I had to give another criticism, it would be the characters who are just bland. But who goes into a film like this for its performances? If you're one of those who complains about all the gratuitous violence and gore in horror these days, you'll find Insidious quite welcome. It isn't massively original and probably isn't a film worth watching again, but it is still well worth seeing and I would recommend it as an excellent rental choice.",Insidious
680,christina-west09,A refreshingly oppressive atmosphere,9,23 August 2011,"I loved this movie! I enjoy a wide variety of horror/thriller/scary films. I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of this one. The overall feel, direction, and acting of this film were perfect. But there were a few particular points that made this film for me...-The music! I've noticed a few reviews where people are saying the music is overbearing, or too loud. But I loved it. Every scary film I've seen recently sticks with quiet creeping scores, which have their place. But this film had loud in-your-face music, which perfectly sets and works within the tone and feel of the film.-The color of the film was interesting. The lack of saturation in the film was definitely an interesting choice, but again, it worked. It set up the feel of the film, in an unexpected way. It added an oppressive feel to the atmosphere.-The acting was pretty good. Not amazing, but very good. Believable characters, and fairly strong dialogue. I was not disappointed.-Finally, the finale is fantastic. I won't give any details away, but I will say I was more than satisfied with it.Overall I would go see this film again, in theaters. I will definitely be buying it for my personal collection. I highly recommend it for everyone, and especially those found of scary films.",Insidious
681,kieragriff,"Quite Boring, Actually",3,15 November 2011,"Note/Warning: Contains SpoilersI watched this movie thinking that it would be good. Scary. Creepy. It was none of those, except for maybe creepy. The problem with this movie is that nothing ever happens! Don't get me wrong, the plot is wonderful and the acting is decent, but the trailers are misleading. The only scary part in this whole movie for me would have to be Tiny Tim's (or as I like to call him, Tommy) face appearing behind that other guy's head whose name eludes me right this second. The only good acting came from the kid who played Dalton and the old women really went overboard. The movie was quite boring and really could've been better. I didn't find it all that scary, though the ghosts creeped me out. My suggestion is to either skip this one completely or rent it. I don't suggest the ladder suggestion.",Insidious
682,Dan-willock,Good idea ruined,5,17 September 2011,"After watching this film the first time I have to admit it was quite jumpy and creepy at times. The start to the middle of this film is brilliant, good acting, good story line and an excellent idea. The positives of this film, mainly the idea of going out of your body when your sleeping, which i have read about people believing they can do this. Even i must admit that I've had dreams where i had overlooked myself sleeping. So allowing people to relate to the movie is great. The creepiness that you experience in this film is the kind that makes you not be able to sleep at night, with the small child laughing and running around, but not being able to see his deformed face properly makes it worse (apparantly). Now for the problems, there are a few that ruined the film. firstly there was 'the man with fire on his face' this was just funny, it ruins all of the scary shadows that you might of saw throughout the film of this devil kind of thing. It basically just looks like an ugly man with paint on his face. There are too many hidden meanings in this film, after watching it more than once and also watching the making, they talk about how the child was a deformed man, which in the film you know nothing of this, and the devil man was meant to of rubbed lipstick all over his face? i just thought it was a bad make up artist. Lastly the further idea and the possessed child also ruined the film, making it boring and just plain funny. Overall worth a watch but not the greatest film.",Insidious
683,Lu-cy,They should have kept it simple,6,18 September 2011,"Because the movie is from Paranormal Activity's creators I expected a lot more. Insidious was a good movie not boring at all but it wasn't that scary. The main spirit (with the red face) was scary when you saw it in the dark in the corner but in the end when it was at close you could see it was just a dude with painted face and that kind of ruined it for me.I think I was tricked little bit 'cos I thought that kid was going to be possessed and then he would be the one freaking out the family. The boy was possessed like 15 minutes in the end (if I understood right). Creators should have kept it simple possession story and not mix it up like they did. And by the way the trailer wasn't that good.Actors were great! Specially Rose Byrne played her part as Renai Lambert really well. The ""ghostbusters"" guys weren't that good. They tried to be funny but it didn't really work.The end was unexpected I give credits for that. I was so sure that there was going to be happy ending but I liked how it turned out.Anyway it was good movie (not amazing) and I don't think that I wasted time watching it. Still it didn't get in to my top 10 horror movies.",Insidious
684,knotholaze,At last another real horror movie after a long time.,8,6 June 2012,I watched that the ratings of the movie is 6.8 and I think it is still under-rated. The making of the movie so awesome that its frightens people. It is only comparable to the movie 'The Exorcist'. The most important thing about the movie is the scary part of the movie is properly placed that makes me frightened. Some part of the movie may seem like monotonous but I think it was for maintaining sequence of the movie. The acting was also good. I think Hollywood made a real horror film after a long time after 'The Exorcist'.One last thing about the movie is if someone watch this before sleep he or she can't sleep without a cold feeling of fear.,Insidious
685,JRubioSpain,Are you kidding me?,2,1 November 2013,"In fact,I wasn't any intention to watch this first part but I decided to give it an opportunity taking into account that the second part is on theaters right now! I should have followed my instinct! The only one reason why this movie hasn't disappointed me is because I didn't wait anything at all from it! So I was right because there's nothing right or surprising in it!I know the budget was just 800,000 dollars but I think they could have saved the money instead of wasting them. Seriously?! It's the worst horror movie I've ever seen...Who had the idea of making a second part? What's more, who's going to pay for watching it? Although I'm changing my mind right now... it's not possible that any second part was worse than this!",Insidious
686,ThomasQuill,Good on first viewing,5,29 March 2013,"Before I saw this movie I heard that this movie was really scary, and as a fan of horror, I really wanted to see this. So I found it, and it scared me a lot! I was thinking it was terrifying, but then i had to stop watching because my computer was getting slow. I didn't back to it till maybe a week, and coming back to it I realised there were only around 15 minutes left, so I was hoping it would be worth it. And, it was meh. I could see what they were trying to do, but it just wasn't as good as what was earlier in the film. You see, earlier on pop ups were used, which were very scary, but that's why I've given this such a low rating, not only is the ending not as interesting as most of the movie, but it's the fact that they use pop ups, which can only be scary the first time you watch them. Although that being said, one of the reasons I gave this a 5 is because there is one scene that uses a pop up that is always chilling to watch. Not because it gives you a fright, but because of the very look of it, and how it was shot. I think that pop ups in horror movies are a little lazy to be honest. I don't think giving someone a 'fright' is exactly scaring them. I think to scare an audience well, you should leave them with an idea that will stick with them, certain images that will stick with them, and if you've seen the movie you may think that, and that's what I thought so too, The Lipstick Demon, is an example. Freaky at first, but when you actually think about it, you think, at least I do ""Lipstick? Come on."" And he does kind of look like Darth Maul, although, actually funnily Darth Maul is scarier looking, at least to me. When watch Insidious the second time or more, other than the scene I have mentioned, not much really scares me. When a pop up comes up, I don't react at all. I used to think this was better and scarier than The Exorcist, but looking back at what I said, I cannot believe I said that. The Exorcist not only has a more interesting story and characters, it is something I will always find scary. This, if you haven't seen it, go watch it and you will probably be scared, but watch it again and you might be like me and not think much of it.",Insidious
687,codyharness,"Good, but not Great",6,25 October 2013,"I finally got around to watching this movie the other day. A lot of my friends have been talking this up as one of the best and scariest horror movies they have ever seen. And while I can honestly say I jumped a few times.... I just don't see how it was that scary. Now don't get me wrong, I liked this movie. Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne both did fantastic jobs pulling off the desperate parent roles. And the little bit that you see him act, the kid was pretty good too. I thought the directing was very good as well. Wan did a good job. The film was dark and gritty. And the jump scares were pretty decent. But in the end that is all that it was to me. A few good jump scares and dark lighting. And I think that that's biggest problem with this movie. There is something lacking in the writing. Which is sad because I'm a big fan of Whannell's other work, with the Saw franchise. But I seriously think he dropped the ball on this one. While the story certainly wasn't BAD. It wasn't great either. It seemed to rely to much on jump scares and never really builds much tension. As I said earlier, I really did like this movie, but I just don't think It's as great as some people say it is.",Insidious
688,corabruins,This one hits the spot!,7,26 February 2012,"I'm a real sucker for a good scary movie but most of the time they are to bad to watch. Making a movie that really scares people is a gift and over the years there is a whole stack of producers/directors that didn't take that seriously.The summary for this movie is a bit of a letdown so I thought I would see the very next bad horror movie in a row.It was actually a big surprise!A storyline that can live up to my expectations, scary moments that gave goosebumps and made me jump up from my seat (that hardly ever happens)and actors who I can relate to as normal human beings who get into a situation that you can refer to as abnormal.In fact I liked the most that the makers put in some humor what makes it even more a good film. Life is all about relativity and humor is by far not used enough in movies that call themselves scary.The only thing that bothered me were the much to overdone and loud sound effects.It didn't need them to make the case and it started annoying me after a while. You should get scared of what you're about to see not of what you're eardrums will experience.The actors are well casted and I truly enjoyed this film!",Insidious
689,kiliantennyson-346-551333,Really good,7,10 June 2013,"Its very hard to find a good horror movie these days but insidious is definitely one of the better ones. I loved insidious for not doing a lot of cheap jump scares or using lots of gore, Insidious is a lot more subtle than that. It might be something in the background but its a lot creepier when you notice the scare after a few seconds. It had a bit of originality in it but it was a little too close to other paranormal movies to be extremely memorable. That being said as I sat there in the dark at 2 in the morning watching this, it did terrify me. It may not be as original as Saw or Paranormal Activity when they first came out but it is certainly a good horror movie, and with Insidious 2 coming out it could be the start of a new franchise.",Insidious
690,tconba-358-624806,Absolutely Awful,1,9 November 2012,"The worst horror film I have seen, ever. 1 star is a bonus. Really do not waste your time. Trying to introduce a Freddie Kruger like character that has no back story or apparent relevance. The father following his son in to some place that can only be described as absolute rubbish, why would anyone want to astral project if that was all that they got leaves little to the imagination Also where did the idea that malevolent spirits exist on the astral planes come from, that is not something I have ever heard of. If one is producing fiction with some believability then at least make sure certain aspects of the back story are at least fairly accepted. Overall stay away from this film at all costs, it is not worth the frustration of watching it",Insidious

I wish I was recording this one.I had chills for much of this movie, and many worthy surprises.The acting was very good, the plot largely recycled, but this the unique twists, worth watching again. Not excessively gory, but definitely kinda creepy.Will keep me up tonight, and probably make for some interesting dreams. If you like something spooky, this is it.",Insidious
692,diescheisselol,Do you enjoy really well thought out horror? Then avoid.,2,1 December 2013,"Two stars is being generous. Maybe they could have done something with this movie, but it ended up being very forcibly random, rather than deeply obscure. It got to the point, about 20 minutes until the end, where I was pretty far into some games on my phone out of boredom, and I looked up like ""How is this still going? What can they possibly torture me with for TWENTY more minutes?"" But they'll find some more crap to throw at you, don't worry. AT LEAST the twist at the end is okay, though entirely expected. That's where the extra star comes in. Otherwise it would be one.I consider myself a connoisseur of weird/disturbing/creepy movies. This is not anywhere near being any of those things. If you consider yourself a lover of deep creepiness, who yearns for the movie that will leave you still thinking, when you should be sleeping, then you need to run screaming from this movie.TL;DR version: Why did I waste my time watching this?

Renai and Josh Lambert must then fight to keep malevolent spirits from trapping Dalton in an unknown realm known as 'The Further'. Insidious is definitely one of the creepiest/ eeriest supernatural horror/ thrillers I've seen. The whole idea of the unknown, lucid dreamland aka 'The Further', is unsettling because it's not too hard to imagine it existing. It may even be real! Insidious has mastered the balance of jump scares and suspense to be able to mark this movie as a psychological horror. Not only is this movie creepy as hell, but it's also an in-depth look at what could be happening when we're asleep. I'd say the closest counterpart to Insidious would be ""The Conjuring meets Inception"".",Insidious
694,zulei-khan,Well written and played your own fears against you!,9,30 September 2012,"I have just finished forcing myself to watch this film for the second time.....and I say forced because I still haven't gotten over seeing it in the theatre last year! This film stays with you long after you get home, then as you timidly start to turn off the lights to go to bed....you realise how much it has affected you! Let me start this review by saying that Insidious is a horror film that has taken on board all the scare tactics that every brilliant thriller/ horror has accomplished.....then meticulously uses these tactic to take you on roller-coaster of emotions from slight paranoia to downright ""I can't breath I'm so scared"" fear.Immediately, as the opening credits begin stirring your inner paranoid thoughts,Insidious is blasted on the screen with threatening strings playing in the background with an old school Thriller/Psycho motif, and you already have hairs on your arms prickling with anticipation. You soon find your ears tingling at the slightest sound, and your eyes searching for creatures in the shadows and the film continues in this fashion for the next 103 mins leaving you sinking back in your chair dreading the next scene because your every sense is terrified.I don't want to ruin the story for you with specifics, but, like any horror, you must let the film take you on the ride. The 'bad guy' is scary as hell, and while there are SAW-esque elements to the film, this film stands alone as it's own entity. I commend these guys for bringing out another psychologically played movie where your mind leads you into deeper fear and the film makers take full advantage of this.Please, if you are a scare seeker, you must see this film. These guys know what they are doing......and maybe wear a nappy cause you are at risk of wetting your pants :)The story could have sunk had it not been the brilliant directing and actors involved. The beautiful Rose Byrne leads a fantastic cast that you care for, and sometimes have a laugh at, they actually respond in a realistic way which makes the film more believable.The only thing that I took 1 point off for was how the 'bad guy' was depicted in the end 10 mins where we really see it for what it is. This is where the SAW-esque elements are really seen, and it takes away from the horrifying way we are introduced to it, it's almost like there is no real big show down....However the film has scares coming at you until the bitter end. Enjoy...but leave some lights on in the house...trust me",Insidious

I found many parts frightening such as when Rose Byrne hears threatening whispering voices on the baby monitor and lots of other disturbing scenes. Insidious was rated 14A which I think wasn't appropriate. I think that it should of got a PG with sub headlines of ""disturbing scenes"" and ""Not recommended for young children"". I think this because I have seen PG horror movies that are much scarier because they are actually realistic! Almost all of the disturbing and scary scenes were extremely far-fetched and unrealistic which makes it less insidious!

I scare very easily, I've watched films in the past where I have found it difficult to sleep afterwards...this is what you want a horror film to do. Make you think once you've left the cinema, or check behind you when you are walking up the stairs to bed. Insidious did non of these things.The film starts like a lot of other horror movies, slowly. Which is fine because you suspect they are building up the suspense. Actually what they are doing is lulling you into a false sense of security and preparing you for the biggest load of crap you will ever watch.I think my main issue with this film is that it just isn't scary. At all. The music is laughable, I'm sorry but no matter how many times you play really loud violins at me I'm not going to jump. The main 'demon' looks like Darth maul crossed with a goat crossed with a snake - in fact, it look like a dude with loads of makeup on and false hooves, again, not scary but quite funny. The ghosts which make an appearance throughout the film are stupid, a little boy, 2 weird women who smile, and a guy who looks like he should be in a budget vampire film - seriously?! And the concept of the 'Further' is more sci-fi than horror, and since when has sci-fi been fear inducing? Plus the ending was predictable. Which never helps.

699,SamMosqueda,Pure arrogance and I loved every single second of it.,7,2 April 2014,"Insidious is not an original movie, nor is it groundbreaking. So why in the world did I find this movie so riveting and terrifying? The directing in this movie is fantastically chilling. James Wan masterfully builds tension and earns his scares. From the main title of this movie I was tense and felt something wicked on its way. This film made me feel like there was an evil presence staring me in the face which no other movie has made me feel. Every environment I found the characters in had a life of its own, each one more evil than the last. I felt as if I were walking on thin ice and every scare was a heavier and heavier step. I call this movie arrogant because it does not respect it's audience. It takes everything you have ever felt when watching a horror movie and uses it against you to catch you off guard. An incredibly disturbing journey Insidious manipulates your anxiety at will and definitely sticks its audience.",Insidious
700,tljq,Watch and Weep,8,10 October 2013,"Most horror movies ease you into the various degrees of the fear factor. Insidious skips the series of subtle, scary foreshadowing and dives deep into horrifying scene sequences. There are too many lame films in this genre that can make a viewer become immune to scenes that have others screaming like children. This movie will pierce through that immunity and have you freaked out and jumping out of your seat. What makes the final third of the film bad? It's the transition from a feeling of paranormal, possession-level fear to a fun house-type creepiness, which fails to deliver. Unfortunately, the conclusion of the movie can leave the viewer feeling disappointed. Is it worth watching? Absolutely. The beginning is so superb that it makes up for the ending and won't be a waste of time.",Insidious
701,Flanneletteshirt,Disappointed,6,28 December 2013,"After years of hype for this movie and my love for Rose Byrne, I finally caved in and, accompanied by my younger sister, sat down to watch Insidious with reasonably high hopes (due to several positive reviews).Let's just I was quite disappointed. Rose Byrne and Patrick Wilson pulled off near flawless performances and the cinematography was very well done, however it wasn't even as remotely horrifying as some had said. It was cheesy for the most part. The first 20-40 minutes is relatively scary if attention is paid properly, with small jumps that can successfully freak you for that moment, but as the story unfolds so does the cheeseball. Honestly, this movie is really nothing we haven't seen before, just a highly overrated, been-there done-that, special effects, ""horror"" film.I wouldn't say this is an awful movie, not even close to that, but it definitely does not live up to its popularity and is something you should be able to get a good nights sleep after.Also, I am a major fan of horror films but usually avoid films with paranormal themes as they scare the absolute daylights out of me for weeks, but this one is pretty safe and ordinary. Paranormal Activity will scare you a lot more than this.I wouldn't not recommend this, but just for the sake of your satisfaction go in without any expectations and let it serve you with its original purpose.",Insidious

703,Transworld22,Insidious' potential was lost in act 2.,5,10 August 2013,"James Wan's Insidious (2010) suffered from the same fate that, unfortunately, a lot of modern day original horror films suffer from; asking the audience to suspend their disbelief just a little too much.The opening thirty minutes were promising, with the film seemingly setting up a solid group of questions that were worthy of answers: Whose kid is that? What's that creepy music? Is the mother imagining this? Why's the Dad never been caught in a photograph?Unfortunately, Leigh Whannell's script never took us to what I felt would be appropriate answers to any of them with the Saw (2004) writer instead taking the film on a run through alternate universes and demon mythology wrapped in to one 'Daddy re-establishes himself as the centre of the home' piece which seemed entirely formulated and lacking in originality. At its base, Insidious (2010) was always going to be a horror film that intended to make you jump from your seat and it did a pretty good job of presenting those moments. However, in asking its audience to believe that the child was lost in an alternate reality and that the only way to save him was for his Father (who could do the same thing) to go in after him and 'return him home' just seemed way too much of an almost instant widening of the audiences perception of reality and thus alienated the more logical viewer like myself. From that point on, I became disinterested and therefore not very afraid. Perhaps that was my lack of imagination, or my vast disappointment that such a potentially great 21st century horror descended in to something I wasn't much of a fan of. Either way, it failed to thrill me for 2/3's of its runtime despite acceptable presentation and such an intense and promising opening.",Insidious

The next time I turn on a horror movie that starts with 'family moves into new house, and its haunted', I'm turning it off.Also the audio volume range is here to the moon. Dialogue is turned so far down that you have to turn it way up to hear anything, just for the constant jump scares to wake up the whole house. Screw any directors that do this.",Insidious
706,badrak2007,Highly Insidious,9,28 September 2013,"""Insidious"" is a confident attempt at reviving the Haunted House genre, in more of a creepy and disturbed fashion. From the nostalgic blood-red opening credits to the chilling twist at the end, James Wan's well- crafted gem will get under your skin and into your mind.A married couple, Josh and Renai(Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne) have recently moved into their new home and it isn't long before they're eldest son Dalton (Ty Simpkins) slips rather easily into a coma, which doctors find no cause. This coma marks the start of the 'Spirit realm on the loose', or as the movie refers to it as ""The Further"". The first half of the film is some of the best horror filmography I've seen in a while, it's main asset is its ability to leave the horror in the viewers imagination. Ironically this ideal is totally bashed in the latter half and if you've seen the movie you'll be well-aware of what im talking about. In spite of this, the movie definitely serves some well-cooked scares throughout, and most importantly will leave the lasting impression horror fanatics have been looking for.Wan is beginning to monopolize the horror genre. His recent chill-fest 'The Conjuring', has simply out-played all other competition alike, and genuinely raises the bar for Haunted House Horrors. ""Insidious"" may not be the stand-out poltergeist film that ardent horror fans know and love, but is a sincerely spine-chilling attempt at horror done well. 9/10 - Definitely one to see",Insidious
707,rebadac,Not very original and not very scary,3,14 May 2011,"Some of my friends told me it was one of the scariest movie they ever saw... After having seen it, I am dumbfounded by what makes people scared and what not. I also agree with the people saying it has a lot of poltergeist rip offs. But also from the shining and i presume a lot of other horror movies. The movie was very cliché like... ""Girls always have to scream when they get scared"" ""The electricity always fail when evil is present"" ""small children run around as decoys"" ... etc etc The acting becomes strained because of how strangely the characters react to different situations. There was a lack of genuine response and emotions in certain situations. Take for example the scene where they boy has just been ""comatised""; The father coldly asks the doctor ""so, what do we do...? should we stay here or..."" What parents would even ask such a question? No parent in their right mind, traumatised or not would even think to ask that. If they would have just focused on Rose Byrne's -at least genuine felt- feelings and he just stayed quiet that scene would have been OK.This kind of non real reactions to situations just disturbed me throughout the movie.Even tough I could have coped with this, the movie all of a sudden went very ""theatrical"". Meaning they showed way too much of faces wearing way too much paint, acting way too theatrically. It just killed the suspense, making it more of an ""action"" movie than a horror movie.Thinking back on the movie I think there was too many logical errors. If you can talk about logic when talking about ""paranormal"" happenings. For example... Dead, -evile?- people are trying to get to the other side by using other bodies as vessels... but still they can get through to the other side physically and attack people seemingly when it suits them... So why the h*** do they need a vessel for?... why not take over the world anyways? Other scenes seemed just random, adding no explanation to what was happening.The use of string instruments for creating suspense is OK if used conservatively, but in insidious they were just overused to no end! Sometimes I felt like I was watching a black and white horror movie.There is only one twist in the movie, and you will know where it is if I say that this twist occurs where all horror movies always have a twist. I hope to God though, there will not be an Insidious 2.The cinematography worked, although I felt the camera was sometimes too far away from what was happening where it should have been close to the actor. The smoke/fog machine was used a little bit too much when it was used. The camera angles where non-original and mostly panned, glided or zoomed.What about the good stuff? Yes, what about it? For me, I think the best scene in the movie was when one of the ""nerds"" in the psychic team went around the house taking camera snapshots with different color-filters. It reminded me somewhat of when playing the computer game ""fatal frame"".I give this movie a 5 for cinematography, a 2 for story, and a 3 for acting. In total a 3.",Insidious
708,thatmadcupcakex,Possibly the scariest movie I've ever seen,10,14 June 2014,"my god. Where do I start? This movie has everything. It is unbelievable. I first remember seeing this movie when I was about 15, and I went with two of my friends. One of my friends was a huge horror fan and has seen probably every horror film going, whereas one was a little more anxious about horror. I was quite new-ish to horror movies and I hadn't really seen many in the cinemas before but I was pretty much okay with horror so I decided to see this. Let me just say one thing- I'm so glad I wasn't on my own in the cinemas. It was absolutely terrifying. The first 5 minutes set the typical horror movie scene- a husband and wife and their kids moving into a new home. It was pretty much basic for the first 5 minutes or so, and even then it didn't completely pick up until about 20 minutes in. I didn't feel anxious at all, and to be honest I was feeling a little bored- But then the true horror of the movie really kicked in. From about 25/30 minutes of the movie all the way to the end, I was absolutely terrified out of my wits. I jumped at almost everything, I was shaking- I even screamed at one point and made half of the cinema scream with me. I was so terrified that I just wanted to leave the cinemas and never come back, and I couldn't bear another second of it. My friend who has seen more horror movies than either of us can count had her hands over her ears, my friend who is anxious of horror was covering her eyes, and I had both my eyes and ears covered. I didn't remove them until about 20 minutes from the end, looking up occasionally to see what was happening. When the movie ended, I was thrilled... although I could hardly walk as my legs felt like jelly and I was shaking like a leaf. That night, I was hidden behind a cushion for 3 hours staring into space. Eventually, I got the movie on DVD and learned to not be as scared of it. In fact, I really liked the movie since refusing to ever watching it again when I saw it at the cinema. Even now though, I am 17 years old (almost 18) and I have watched more horror movies than I can even begin to contemplate and every genre there has ever possibly been. No horror movie ever seems to bother me anymore, however Insidious will always be an exception. If it is dark, I still cannot watch it, or if I'm in the house on my own. And the longer I go without watching it again in a period of time, I forget about what happens and end up jumping at everything again. If you want a good quality horror movie and want a twist on the typical ghost elements, then this is the movie for you. It has everything a horror movie should have- slamming doors, ghosts around every corner, creepy kids, a sinister demon, things that go bump in the night... you name it. But what most horror movies missed out on was the element of surprise and the tension that is constantly built up to create a super-scary atmosphere. It's one of those movies where you expect something jumpy to happen, and it doesn't, but then something else happens and you almost jump out of your seat. If you get the chance, it is a 100% must see. 10/10 for the scares and acting.",Insidious
709,jessieliu,The best scariest movie I have seen,8,21 June 2015,"This is my second scary movie I have seen during my lifetime even I am just fourteen years old. And after I watched this movie, I can't sleep at night. But I was still interest of insidious2 and insidious3, then I watched. But I still think the first one is the best. The insidious2 contains too many unimaginable and unexplained things that make me confused. And I was so disappointed of insidious3 because it makes me bored and it is not that kind of interesting. But it didn't make me feel dislike of these movie.So many times I was scream like a baby, the sound that I can't believe but I made it. I was so surprise of director's imagination, and I saw the red door appeared in all of the three movies, that's the important thing that connect the stories together. The red door led them to the story.At the beginning of the stories Lambert family were moved to a new house to get better life. But one day everything is change, Dalton has fell down from the ladder, then fell in a deep sleep, a coma, he slept about three months and return to home. And the unexplained things happened after that, this make Lambert family uncomfortable and scared, Renai thought this is a haunted house. So they moved, but the things kept happening. They ran out of places to go so they found a person Elise who was work for this, she said everything is not because of haunted house, is Dalton. Dalton has a unique ability, a gift, that Dalton can leave his physical body and able to travel places, to see things when he sleep at night, things that living people not supposed to see, the places called the Further. The Further is a world far beyond their own, yet it's all around them. This ability is handed down by Josh. Dalton left his body so long time, the body becomes a empty vessel so the other invisible things smell it and come and try to enter it. That's why the house was haunted. And Josh travel to Further to find his son Dalton. And he succeed. But the story haven't end yet...This film was so true that I felt I was inside the movie. I like the world called the Further even it was so scary to make me scream. After watched this movie, I have a question:"" Is there Further in our life?"" I know it was a baby question but I don't want to know the answer, because I don't think I will able to sleep if I know the answer. At the end of the movie, a horrible thing was enter Josh's physical body, he killed Elise. This is a foreshadowing of next movie.I like this movie very much, I think it is more better than the first scary movie I watched, the Conjuring. I am scared to sleep at night after watched insidious. But I will still watch other good scary movie if I have enough courage to watch. Perhaps there is insidious4 coming soon.",Insidious
710,cHordi9000,Insidious Is Only For A Select Audience of Horror/Suspense Fans,6,10 April 2011,"*POSSIBLE SPOILERS*Lets be real here people, this movie does make you jump.That being said, ""Insidious,"" followed a similar formula of, ""A Perfect Getaway."" That being: A brilliant idea meets an overworked plot. The movie started out creepy, jumpy, and very ominous. But as it progressed I failed to buy into the over-complicated plot. Was the idea cool? You bet. But was it really necessary? Not really.My problem with horror movies like this is that, theatre is classified as art. Art is meant for interpretation, and movies like these end off with very little interpretation. Don't get me wrong, there is a moment where one can wonder at the end what's going to happen, but that still takes away from the overall point. To have, ""Insidious"" end off on an open closure point, and an...almost ""untold"" finish, would have really put more than just the ""jumpy"" fear back into my boots. It makes it mischievous to come home after this movie and think, ""What happened!? What's going to happen to me if I fall asleep and never wake up!?"" Interpretation takes its course. The acting was subpar AT BEST, I have no idea where the other two kids went throughout the movie, and the characterization that was developed early was useless.For those who like the closure points and modern day generic style of horror movies then ""Insidious"" is for you. For those who like to come up with your own ideas, it is still possible to enjoy the movie as is, but seeing as it's average at best like a vas majority of recent horror/suspense movies. Trust me when I say... it is not for every horror/suspense fan.",Insidious

Until...Spoilers Ahead:The first half of the movie was great, atmospheric, exciting and full of tension, but when the second act (the plot) kicked in, I thought... What the Actual Hell, are you freaking kidding me... Ghosts with greasepaint on them? A stage that looked like a high school theater play? This took me all out of the movie. It went from a good thrilling movie to a mediocre school play...I know I'm gonna hurt some fanboys feeling, but Come on!No, this wasn't my cup o tea.

Excellent eerie build up, suspense and scares in perfect equal measures, you have no idea where it's all going. Then half way through the explanations come and it all goes in the same predictable direction. This film really excelled itself though. I can accurately tell you the exact moment the film takes that familiar downward turn. It's when the family move from the massive, eerie, creaky house to the small suburban bungalow. I suppose it's to lull us into a false sense of security. The bungalow is light, airy modern it's daylight no nasties can get us here. Oh but here they come. Actually it's not the move itself it's the entrance of two 'comical' 'Ghostbuster' type characters with weird and wonderful gadgets to seek out those ghosties. They then call in their grandmother-like boss to do the real psychic stuff, and to give us the longest explanation of the spooky goings on that I've ever heard in a film. It was here that I started clock watching and annoying everyone around me by shifting in my seat.

Below you can find why.1) Great Acting Partick Wilson and Lin Shaye rock the movie. Also side characters Rose Byrne Leigh Whannell Angus Sampson make the film going in energy fear and suspense. Acting 10/9 2) Wonderful atmosphere and ambiance. This movie has its own unique atmosphere that can scare all kind of people. No body can leave this movie without 2 eyes open I can guarantee. For me this movie like the pc game Amnesia dark decent. You have only gun which is your light. You walking in enemy's who wants your body. Thats really annoying place to find your son. Atmosphere and Ambiance 10/9 3)Great story. Movie has its own aspect depend on Astral ride. İn theatre where I watched movie, after the child go to coma most people in cinema say oh another ghost story bla bla. When Lin Shaye start to give the idea why the child in coma we all shocked and start to close our eyes slowy:D So this story for me 10/10 in all aspects.4)Monsters.The only blow for me in movie is the Red monster which is not scary enough for me. But the lady is not the type you wanna mess with:D. This is the one of the scariest faces in horror movies, I didn't see other then The Fly or Alien which are science fictions. Moreover when Patrick Wilson go to Astral ride the mosnters in there pretty scary also. Sum up these the Lady and other mosnters save the day.

The first half for me is a winner but as we progress the film starts to feel rushed. The story line becomes odd and the horrors begin to look cheap. It falls fowl of the issues most movies that want to scare us do.You see the evil and laugh, the demons and ghouls look like drama students let loose with makeup, the limited use of cgi which I prefer looks cheap.Did it scare me?

722,chandler_tuck,Scariest Movie I've Seen In Years!!!,10,31 March 2011,"I went into this movie confident that it would be a cheesy, campy romp with the same ""tried and true tricks of the trade,"" like when the hero is investigating the creepy music coming from the basement and a cat jumps into frame, but I quickly discovered that this would not be case with Insidious. After watching the move and obsessing on it for about 12 hours now, I can honestly say it's one of the scariest movies I've ever seen. In fact, there were several points during the film where I screamed like a 13-year old girl at a Justin Beiber concert. Keep in mind I was consciously trying my hardest to keep my composure, mainly because I was sitting beside my new girlfriend of 2 months. She, incidentally, didn't make a peep; thankfully, I later found out she had her eyes closed the whole time. I was also expecting to see some blood and guts, especially coming from the guys who made Saw, but there wasn't a drop. Instead, they used just about everything else in their arsenal to scare the bejesus out of me and everyone else in the theater (my girlfriend included). From literally the opening credits, they created an intense, haunting tension that didn't leave my body till several whiskeys and half a Xanax later. And the movie constantly feeds that tension, making even the characters' mundane family life somehow seem utterly terrifying. I was actually exhausted leaving the theater from all of the uncomfortable squirming I was unable to control. I'd say it's the most calories I've ever burned while watching a movie (well, at least a PG-13 movie). Overall, the movie was great. It was crazy scary, thoroughly entertaining, and even surprisingly funny at times. Having said that, it will be quite some time before I watch another horror movie; I have no desire to be turned into a frazzled bundle of nerves again anytime soon. So, if you plan on seeing this movie, please consider this a cautionary reminder: it's probably best to go with someone who's already witnessed you have a complete physical and mental breakdown, so as to avoid an embarrassing drive home. And maybe bring a Xanax as well.",Insidious

724,z-79982,One of the best psychological thrillers of the year,9,3 June 2019,"If you're really into horror movies and you want to get the daylights scared out of you and stay on edge the whole entire movie, Insidious Chapter 1 will knock your socks off. This psychological thriller plays with your mind and knows how to get you frightened as the music of the film builds, makes your skin crawl and the acting is so superb, that you really get a feel for the situations to come during the blockbuster.The movie begins immediately with a group of violins playing high pitched tune to really set the tone for the movie as the tone stays the same for the entire movie and you will not be off edge at any point during the film. The plot begins with a married couple named Josh and Renai Lambert moving into a new home recently and their son named Dalton going into an unexplainable coma as his vital signs are normal and there are no signs of damage even though he fell from a ladder in the attic. The fact that the cause of the coma is unknown causes a lot of stress on the family, and Renai Lambert specifically is looking for anything that could answer as to why Dalton went into a coma. Then one day Josh's mother Lorraine's friend Elise then tells the couple that dalton isn't in a medically induced coma, rather he had apparently been able to travel to other planes and dimensions. He had apparently traveled too far to the point where he couldn't come back, and that his physical body is here but his spiritual body isn't. Elise then states that the only way to get Dalton back is to have Josh go back into the further due to how he is also able to astral project just like Dalton. Elise puts Josh in a trance so that he's able to enter the plane known as ""the further"". Josh eventually gets to the demons lair and finds Dalton there and they both evade the demon attacking them and they both get back into their bodies and just barely get back in time. After all of the action filled scenes towards the end of the film, the film portrays a much calmer mood as the high pitched screechy violin music stops and instead peaceful music was playing. This all abruptly ends with a cliffhanger when Josh gets possessed and strangles Elise to death and Renai finds a photo of Josh with a demon lady behind him showing that he is possessed and that's where the film ends.The music easily was the best part, and made the movie what it is. If it weren't for the music that they used, it wouldn't reel in viewers as well and it likely wouldn't get the viewers attention for the whole entire movie as Insidious did. It continues throughout the movie, keeping me on the edge of my seat. In addition to show how good Insidious is in my opinion, note that the director of Insidious also directed legendary horror movies such as Saw and The Conjuring - both of these psychological thrillers made an insane amount of money in the box office.The only negative that I had about this film was that they made some scenes a little too dramatic when they didn't need it to be. Like for example, in one scene early in the movie, they show the Lambert family getting for ready for the day and the feel of the scene gave off a very intense and stressful vibe to it, and it was unnecessary because it was early in the movie and there was no drama going on at all.If you truly want to see a great psychological thriller that really plays with your mind and knows how to toy with it, creating excitement, the movie that would fit that desire would be Insidious Chapter 1. The music sets the movie up perfectly with it's skin-crawling and eerie vibe, the way the movie makes you feel the character's situations, and overall how spooked anyone will get while watching this masterpiece. It's a great ride.",Insidious

Well made and as creepy as I would imagine a movie could be w/o being exploitative in some fashion. However, I was shocked when I left the movie w/ my three friends (all of which loved the movie and, like myself, have seen thousands of horror flicks), I heard a meathead-ish guy behind me being like, ""dude, that didn't scare me at all, I thought it was funny.""This reminded me of a few of my other friends that always laughed during scary movies - I was never annoyed by this until I noticed that they laughed harder during movies that I thought were scarier than the average horror flick (e.g. Exorcist, The Shining, etc). Upon further research, I feel quite confident that this type of reaction is disingenuous and, apparently, quite prevalent. Psychologists have examined it for years. Many people, when scared, are able to disassociate from the traumatic situation w/ laughter. This is how they minimize the extent to which they are ""scared"".That being said, w/ people like this out there (and likely critics, too), I would imagine it is a VERY tough battle trying to out-do horror classics. Not only are there these disassociate types, but people are generally more desensitized overall, so you are trying to scare an audience that isn't as easily scared.My point is this - this movie was very well made and very scary/creepy despite some of the comments to the contrary - I'm sure there is merit to some of the criticisms about the acting and such, but I believe very strongly that this movie will eventually get the credit it deserves.",Insidious

In the film, parents Josh and Renai move into a new house with their children Dalton, Foster, and Cali. During one of the first days that they are in their new home, they notice some strange activity going on. One morning, Dalton wakes up in a coma that doctors can't explain. When they get paranormal investigators involved, they soon find out that Dalton isn't actually in a coma, his soul has traveled into another dimension, causing demons to come from that dimension into the real world to bring pain and terror upon Dalton's family. The movie ends with a huge cliffhanger, making the audience eager for the sequel.
Insidious demonstrates solid acting throughout, with exceptional jobs by Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne who play the roles of Josh and Renai Lambert. They bring out the true fear that is felt throughout the film. Patrick Wilson is known for the roles that he plays in horror films, such as The Conjuring, The Conjuring 2, and Annabelle Comes Home. It is because of his strong acting in Insidious that he was able to play big roles in all of these other horror films.
Something that I took out of this movie that really spiked the level of terror was the soundtrack. Throughout the movie, eerie music and sounds would play whenever something bad was about to happen, or when there were big jump scares. Many people think it's cheesy to add loud, unnecessary sounds to a scene that is already terrifying, but I find that it really adds to the overall horror and suspense of the film. The song Tiptoe Through the Tulips still gives me flashbacks to nightmares that I have had about the demons that appear while the song is playing. Another quality that adds to the creepy music is the lighting throughout the film. The lighting appears darker than most other horror movies that I have seen, giving it a more sinister vibe. A scene that shows these particular strengths is when Josh enters the further dimension to bring Dalton back to the real world. The further dimension is always dark, and the only color that you can really see is the red door leading to wear Dalton is trapped. During this scene, that eerie music is playing, creating the creepy sinister feeling.
Insidious is a true horror movie that brings some of the strongest qualities that one would look for in something scary. If you're looking for a seriously terrifying movie with jump scares and great acting, look no further. Insidious will have you begging for the sequel.",Insidious
733,ericaland2003,So Close to Being a Classic,8,3 April 2011,"This film had such a fresh premise and could have been right up there with the Exorcist, but it's overshadowed at times by a ridiculously over the top soundtrack and some corny moments that were almost laughable which is too bad. But it's still worth checking out.Spoiler Alert: There are some weak plot holes like the other kids pretty much disappearing for the second half of the film with only a quick mention of there whereabouts. Or not really explaining why the psychic needed a gas mask to communicate with the comatose boy. Nevertheless, it was still one of the better horror films I've seen in awhile because the basic idea that drives the plot was rather interesting. It explores not just the idea that we leave our bodies when we dream, but that evil could take advantage and try to possess you. For that I have to give the writers credit for being truly original, although you might call this a dark twist on ""Poltergeist.""",Insidious
734,harjainavya,"Not the best, but definitely one of the sacariest.",8,14 July 2020,I would like to say that Mr. Wan has a good taste as i've seen Conjuring and now this. It isn't the scariest of all but definitely a very good horror flick,Insidious
735,gerfologist,Gives hope for horror,8,17 April 2011,"This movie has restored my hope in the horror genre. It does just about everything right. One thing that particularly impressed me is the fact that they managed to keep it scary while revealing what was haunting them. This movie mixes both terrifying visuals and a haunting story to create a old-style yet unique horror experience. As for comedy, it does have a little bit at the very right moments to act as comic relief. And one scene is quirky yet unsettling at the same time. Insidious isn't like any other modern horror movie, it take queues from the classics while mixing in a modern feel and is a very good combination of the two. Also, the acting is superb. Watch this movie if you are a fan of horror.",Insidious
736,musedl,Awful,1,31 October 2020,"This movie is terribly overrated. I went in expecting something that I could turn off my brain and enjoy to, but it was insulting. Terrible waste of time. Poor acting, bad pacing, and cringeworthy tone changes. The ending was absolutely pointless and doesn't deserve praise.",Insidious
737,bricecorbin,Waste of time,3,25 August 2011,"A really big waste of time, really. Don t bother watch this movie...Except if u're 13... Scenario is awful and really boring. Acting performance are really low, i really wonder how they could have such a good actress doing such a poor performance. Effect are like they are coming from a 80s movie... It s this kind of movies where you wait and wait and wait, and u keep saying yourself it can t be that bad something will happen and i ll change my mind about but it never come and in the end u really feel that u wasted your time... And it let you believe in the end that there could be a insidious 2 in the way, please producer let it go... A very big deception.",Insidious
738,ericlowe-10702,Scary? More like ridiculous.,3,12 November 2020,"How people find this scary is confusing. Maybe I'm biased because I watch a lot of horror movies, and when I say a lot, I mean a LOT. I went into this movie expecting something akin to The Exorcist and similarly great horror movies and expecting to be truly scared. I'll admit, the introductory 20 or 30 so minutes was expected. ""Typical family does family things after a move, kid gets curious and explores a part of the new house."" That's where I got hopeful that the horror would start.. right?NOPE. Big, fat tease. Kid screams, camera cuts to the parents running up to get him, what he saw is never explained until much, much later in the movie. Continues along for a little bit while introducing the kid's gone comatose with some creepy stuff here and there, but nothing really pops out at me. Still no explanation on what the kid saw.. but clearly, to the viewer and mother, paranormal stuff is going on. Finally gets to the point where they decide to do something about the paranormal. Bring in an expert aaand.. ""It's astral projection.""Gotta at least give the movie some props here for building off of something like that. I truly didn't expect something like that to be the cause of the paranormal stuff going on.. HOWEVER, throughout the remainder of the movie, nothing really scary actually happens. A jumpscare here, scary music with nothing but a creepy event there.. All in all, nothing really got to me besides a jumpscare or two.My final take on this? Cheap jumpscares, over reliance on scary music and creep factor with minimal to no payout, and I swear some of the actors look like they're only half interested sometimes, the dad especially. Putting makeup alone on someone to make them look like a demon isn't scary on its own(I'm looking at you Red Face). Props for trying with the other ghouls/ghosts/whatever they are when in that ""astral plane"" though. One last thing.. Tiny Tim's Tiptoe Through the Tulips? Really? Who thought that would be a good idea, let alone creepy, in a movie like this?",Insidious
739,maverick_saturn_626,Disappointing,4,8 May 2011,"As a dedicated horror fan and a fan of the original Paranormal Activity, this film just didn't have the lasting appeal I thought it would, in fact, I walked away from it wondering what was the best way to relieve my bored mood.See the thing is, I'm all for scare tactics (despite the fact they never work on me) and there isn't a horror movie I haven't watched and despite not finding scary, enjoyed none the less, take The Grudge for example (Let us not speak of the third one), while I didn't find the The Grudge scary, I did at least find it entertaining, Insidious on the other hand was not, I didn't consider it to be scary, nor did I consider it to be entertaining. There were a few 'when things go bump in the night' scenes which were okay at best, but the whole scare factor is lost because you already know what the cause of it is, and quite frankly, knowing what is causing the haunting as well as the fact they mean no harm, just makes things a little less scary or interesting.The scare factor of Paranormal Activity is in the fact that something is stalking our main characters, we know not what, but it means harm and is willing to kill anyone that intervenes, this just makes it seem all the more fear-worthy.I'm also a person of subtle fear tactics, while I don't mind the loud sudden ""boo!"" effects, I believe that subtle things, like the lights going on and off down the hallway in the Grudge 2, the footprints on the floor and lights down the hallway switching on and off in Paranormal Activity, the dark ghosts prowling on the ceiling and walking up behind a certain girl in The Messengers, etc were all scary and superb in their own rights and if a movie can keep that up right to the end, its all the more enjoyable, the cherry on top being a superb resolution to the issue.Unfortunately insidious had none of these with it's most entertaining scene coming from certain ghost hunter revealing (not really) what we already knew because it's all over the front cover, to which I thought, ""Oh really? Fancy that ey, that sounds like a problem no one has ever solved, how are you going to solve it?"" To which they did......need I say more.",Insidious
740,Danny_Voorthuis,Paranormal activity 2 all over again,5,3 July 2011,"Nothing new, amusing? yes but it reminded me of the paranormal activity movies, only without the real life experience created by the camera work.Insidious does what it has to do at the right moments. A few times I scared myself so much that i practically fell out of bed and awoke my girlfriend. The acting was terrible, I mean a bloodstain of a hand on my sons bed, or strange men in my daughters bedroom would make me leave the house for good!! But i think the actors in this movie don't really believe in their own role, they act scared but they don't mean it, you know what i mean?shortly, a one time experience quickly forgotten. (excuse my bad spelling)",Insidious
741,jisaro-53961,Great first two acts,8,27 July 2021,"Without spoiling anything, the first two acts of this movie is great, tension is built well, you feel for the characters. But once the movie reach it's climax it sort of duds and takes us away from reality. But there's an ending twist that makes the lull worth it!",Insidious
742,gongsihan,It's so scary,8,19 August 2021,"It's quite reasonable to say it's James Wan's best so far. He really knows how to scare audiences. Unlike most horror movies,scary things don't happen because the characters want to explore somewhere frightening. Instead,it's because the spirits want the boy's body. That's what makes the film unique.",Insidious
743,tikolieou,The title says it all,7,3 April 2011,"""Insidious,"" has been one of the few well-made horror films that have come out in the past several years, that kind of stays with you and gets under your skin. While other reviews have noted the obvious parallels to other horror movies - Poltergeist, Paranormal Activity, etc. - it adds a rather original take on the whole genre of haunting and possession. While I liked the movie overall, I couldn't help, but feel it suffered from an issue that seems to be a common pitfall for most horror films.I'm often surprised how nonsensical the main characters act in horror movies which make me not sympathize with them. For instance, why would Renai be fine with just hanging out at home by herself, after all the craziness of the one night, where the front door is opened, and she sees that man by her baby's crib? Josh seems to be unfazed by the bloody hand/claw print Renai finds on Dalton's bedsheets. Yeah, just normal bloody claw prints on the bedsheets, see them all the time. And after Dalton's room gets destroyed by no apparent thing, he still says to the paranormal investigators, ""You guys are just taking advantage of a bad situation""? Really? But what really got me was how Josh's mother, Lorraine, kind of just only appears when they move into their second house. With all that's happened to her grandson going into a coma, you would think she'd make an appearance at some point during the first part of the movie and impart her knowledge to Renai then. I mean was she traveling in Bali the whole time? Where was she until this point? It just felt so arbitrary that you really felt she was more of a place device than a character.Still, I appreciated the fact, that the scary moments weren't the obvious ""let something jump out when the music builds up"" that you get with most other movies. Interestingly, the scariest moments were never really things having to do with the demon, but the little things. Like the child facing the wall in the laundry room, while Renai is walking through the house, and she doesn't see him there. But I really liked how the movie gave us little clues as to how Josh, was not or rather more than just Josh, and it's only until the end, that we realize Elise's efforts to rid Josh of the hag had failed, and he had been possessed this whole time. And it's that ""Oh sh*t moment,"" that's what makes it so creepy in the end, because his seeming normalcy in the face of it all undermines those other movies of what possession would look like. Instead, it's something that's stealthy, and creeping. It's insidious.",Insidious
744,james-bates-4,Some good ideas but ultimately a poor film,4,12 May 2011,"I had high expectations for this film, and so when I got offered free tickets to the preview screening in Sydney then I jumped at the chance. Sadly, having seen it I now wouldn't recommend it to anyone.It starts out well enough, and there are a couple of 'make you jump' moments within the 1st 30 mins or so. But it then very quickly becomes a very frustrating (and unintentionally funny) film, with nonsensical decisions being made and scary moments just becoming repetitive and obvious cliques. Also, the acting by the father is particularly bad and there were audible groans in the cinema I watched it in whenever he tried to be dramatic.The few good ideas and good characters in the film are quickly over- shadowed and moved aside by the bad ideas and bad characters. Meaning no tension really develops and you are never drawn into the atmosphere.To sum it all, the finale of the film caused huge amounts of laughter in the cinema, rather than building to a scary climax.Avoid.",Insidious
745,yaprasad2003-1,Good Film,7,3 August 2011,"Its a Very Good Film, Very Different kind of Horror Film from all other Movies. Nice story, nice shots.

746,cecilia47,An unexpected surprise...so much FUN!,10,2 April 2011,"This was an unexpected surprise! It had many unique plot twists (the existence of ""the further"") while incorporating both Asian horror films, American classic horror films and tongue-in-check campy ""this is so bad...it's good"" aspects.Hard to describe, unless you've seen it, but the audience was screaming, laughing and groaning. Being someone who was raised on old, black and white Samurai movies and foreign films, like ""Diabolique"" and who loves good supernatural thrillers, old B horror movies (like ""The Mummy's Curse"") and totally terrible, first-time-film-maker attempts at scary movies like the ""The Fanglys"", this was a fun ride from beginning to end.See it, but don't bring your youngsters.",Insidious
747,bmarie_snyder,"The VERY rare, occasional moment of suspense was not worth the $10 I paid to see it.",3,23 April 2011,"To start off, the movie had basically NO direction. There was no story, nothing that grabbed me, because nothing truly happened until about the middle of the movie, and even then nothing truly made sense. Family moves into house, baby cries a lot, creepy noises, next thing you know a child randomly lands into a coma. For what reason? ""The house is haunted"", says the mother of the child(Rose Byrne). WHAT! random comas... scary stuff? Come on guys!!What annoys me the most is that the main characters get spooked by noises before they even truly HEART or SEE anything. Are they unaware that it's an older house? They tend to make noises. Then a fat, ugly guy from the Matrix shows up. Scares the mother. They move into another house. But, oh wait! Your house wasn't haunted, it was your little boy, because he decided to wander a little too far into his dreamland, referred to as, ""the FURTHER""; so the dead are trying to posses his body...?? As this scene was paying in the theater, I was praying this was a joke, and hoping that it wasn't heading into this ridiculous direction,.. but it did. It was pathetic. The characters, or ""beings"",that were meant to terrify me in this movie simply made me laugh, they were hilarious looking(almost like a child's cartoon, or an old cheap horror movie from the 60's). The scenery and surroundings were not scary, the house wasn't even frightful. Overall, there was nothing deep about this film that would draw you in to even understand why what's happening is happening, or even make you WANT to know. Everything is surface, nothing truly makes sense, either. There is absolutely NO connection to anything that's going on. Overall, this movie was a poorly conceived idea, and very disappointing coming from the makers of Saw. I've read reviews with people saying how ""terrifying"" it is, and I've read reviews saying that ""it can't be criticized for copying other films."" But maybe that's not entirely a good thing; it was clearly never tried by other filmmakers because the idea SUCKS! It took what was meant to be a HORROR film, and made it into something mystical, and unreal. And personally, I believe the overall idea of a scary film is to scare the audience, correct? If you make a film appear unreal, it will be feared by no one, therefore defeating the purpose. I recommended this film for the age group of 12-16(preferably little girls) who are easily terrified by bugs. This film couldn't possibly strike fear in anyone else. Fail.",Insidious
748,Bridge2086,Naturally Scary!,10,11 April 2011,"Wow, this is the first movie that actually scared me. I have a love for scary movies but had yet to find a movie that gave me chills, would make me jump, and just scare the hell out of me. The premise of the movie was creepy and just the events that happen in the movie were great. I was holding a wad of napkins from the buttery popcorn, and by the end they were a solid cylinder from me squeezing the crap out of them. By the end of the movie ever hair on my body was sticking up, and chills were running through my body. Just an awesome movie, with a great story line.I hope there is a number two or even just another horror movie made by these guys.....To be honest I want to go back tonight to watch it again, and again...and again.

But if you watch it expecting something new and ground-breaking, because you read that in a review, you will be disappointed if you've seen any horror movies made before the 1990s.There is nothing new here, nothing that hasn't been done before. It's basically like Poltergist and Friday the 13th had a baby, Tiny Tim provided the soundtrack, and Darth Maul makes an uncredited guest appearance.It's an OK horror movie, and if you typically like horror movies, then you'll probably enjoy it. The acting is fairly good, the story is as plausible as any horror movie without being overly complicated.",Insidious
750,menkel77,What are people on about here?,2,16 April 2011,"This is the first movie that made me come here on IMDb and write a review, so better read it! If this movie was ??scary??, as people are writing here, then Shawshank Redemption was awful... you do the math. To sum it all up the movie was - bad, bad, bad, funny, almost the good part, funny, bad, bad, the end. I do not find it very amazing if horror movies are mixed with humor. It just does not work. This movie COULD HAVE been very very good, if Christopher Nolan (Director of Inception) would have made it. But if you check the budgets - Inception was $160 000 000 and Insidious $1 500 000. I would say that is where the problem came from. If you watch this movie, you will get exactly as much as you paid for, or how much the makers of the movie paid for. Give this script to Cristopher Nolan and he will make this movie watchable. I am just amazed that people are here giving it 10 points and saying how scary it was. I was literally scared for only 0 or 1 seconds throughout the movie. The best way to sum this movie is this - Imagine Inception done with a budget of $1 500 000... would you go watch it? Me neither... What ever anyone says, this movie is not worth 7,4 here in IMDb. Absolutely ridiculous... Yes, people have different taste, but you cant really argue this was awful :)",Insidious
751,zthorns,Very enjoyable spooker,10,14 April 2011,"I went into this movie with very little information except for what was shown on the trailer. I expected a cheesy PG rated ""horror"" movie that lacked anything new. Boy, was I wrong. This movie worked on every level for me. Good story, good acting, and some very good scares. I liked the initial Saw movies and Dead Silence, so I should have had more faith in James Wan and Leigh Whannel. One other aspect of the film that worked was that they didn't use humor just so viewers could take a break from story's focus. They did have some humor, but it was minimal and didn't last long. You can tell that not only do they make good horror, but they are fans as well. Only a fan could bring home the scares the way that they do. Nice job.",Insidious
752,Tracy_Michelle88,A Must See!!!!,8,6 April 2011,"All I have to say to James Wan and Leigh Whannell is.....Thank You!!!! ""Insidious"" is such a breath of fresh air when it comes to the horror genre. It's a wonderful homage to some of the great classics, but it puts it's own little spin on it. No cheap scares. No excessive CGI. No blood and guts. Just a simple, creepy, blast of a good old haunted house film. The last time I left a theater after seeing a horror film, and felt this uneasy and satisfied, was back in 2002 when I saw ""The Ring"", which is also PG-13. Once again, thank you guys for reviving the piece of crap otherwise own as today's horror genre. Keep making films like ""Insidious"" and I can assure you they will all be successful:)",Insidious
753,gsampaio1211,Secon half took away the reality,6,30 March 2012,"Maybe it is just me but scary movies are better if they seem real. That's why I loved Paranormal Activity and why the second half of this movie disappointed me. For example, the scene where the physic describes the demon is very intense because despite of its description, our imagination creates our own demon. Of course when I saw (clearly) the demon I was disappointed. We always fear what we don't understand. And if we picture a demon who appears as a man with red and black makeup it looses that scary touch. That was the part that bugged me. The rest of the movie is very enjoyable filled with some unpredictable scares. I recommend you see and most importantly, form your own opinion",Insidious

But with this movie you see so much of the bad guys its as if they are actually alive, and the demon was a bit silly, a weird wacky demon that makes puppets, in a way this movie started off like any great horrors do, but then this morphed into an episode of 'are you afraid of the dark' and i was looking forward to a good flick, i even went to see it just from reading all the reviews from here! shame on you :) They just don't make horror films like they used to...",Insidious

Haunted house, kid sees creepy stuff, nobody believes it at first, later they do believe, they get some paranormal lady who can do something about it, things go good then bad, some epic battle, you think yes! but of course in the end, dun dun dun, it's not the happy ending you where hoping for.I was left with a lot of questions after this movie and not even with a scared feeling.

Cheap costumes, ridiculous story, and absolute horrible directing made it a comedy not a horror movie. The director is an idiot. There were a few scenes that built you up to be shocked and then because of the timing, it fell short and you laughed. Like a comedian telling the punch line of a joke out of sequence.

I fought It would be just like that when I saw that the guys from ""SAW"" directed it ques they are weary talented and together with the ""Paranomal Activity"" gang, they have created together a masterpiece of Horror category.

This is definitely one of the best thrillers I've seen in a long time. I'm more inclined to classify it as thriller, because there aren't too many standard horror scenes of blood and gore. It's a spiritual thriller. I think one of the main reasons I found this so appealing was that it didn't stick to the traditions style of suspense. Most suspense films have a very large build up to a quick, startling moment. While Insidious sticks this this method quite a bid, it's individual because it cuts between serious/frightening and turns around to be almost disturbing/humorous, and then back so fast it would just catch you unaware. Leaving you wondering how you feel about what you just saw. In any case, it's great cinema.",Insidious
763,nickolousmcie,"A cliché run of the mill ghost story, that was predictable from beginning to end.",1,13 November 2011,"The acting of this movie is the worst I've seen in years. The plot, was even more horrendous. When it was revealed that the father was an astral walker, I almost vomited. This thing was draped in cliché from head too toe. And, I can't forget about the costume design of the main demon. It was one of the worst costumes I've ever seen. when I saw the demon send the main character flying back without even touching him, I'd think he would be able to prevent them form escaping. And, oh my god, the man is actually the ghost bride, please. Obviously, since it didn't show him reenter his body, something fishy was going on.

764,KingdomComeTooNight,Finally a modern horror film more than worth seeing...,8,2 April 2011,"Come on people! Why are so many saying this film is not original, i don't know?! Their are certain motifs to consider when making a film, especially one that is in the realm of horror and those motifs dictate what sub genre to put it in, but enough about labels. this film is in a category all its own. why? it's down right GOOD! The acting is on point (lin shay is always amazing!) the direction is beautiful (each shot or frame rather is like a series of paintings and the scenes in ""the further"" are breathtaking) the story IS original. The writers set up a world for the dead and its connection with the living that is quite refreshing.You don't need to be a horror film fan to enjoy this film, especially since it has close to no gore,and relies mainly on suspense. If your looking for a great story, close to a folklore or an extended bedtime story this is the movie for you.",Insidious
765,jutia954,Insidious (NOT),5,18 April 2011,"I think it's OK to watch this film if you know what you're getting yourself into. It's not a great film, it has some scares especially at the beginning but soon even the audience begins to laugh at the not very scary ghosts. This film takes itself too seriously. It is not as good as Poltergeist or Paranormal Activity which you can see it's trying to replicate.The demon and ghost are only scary when they appear unexpectedly however when you get a good look at them (which unfortunately is too often) you see that it's just regular people in costumes and cheap makeup. They even forgot to put some scary teeth on the demon. It all looks very Hallooweenish.When you go see this film expect a TV production of Poltergeist and Paranormal Activity and you won't be disappointed. I for one couldn't stop laughing.",Insidious
766,whitewolfshiranui,Laughable at times.,2,3 April 2011,"I've been anticipating this movie for a while, and when I finally was able to go see it, it delivered- for the first half of it anyways. Like I already said, the first part of this movie was actually excellent, if not a little slow. Around the middle (aka the part where the ghost hunters come in) things started to get laughable. The actors were not the worst but definitely not the best, but around the ending it seemed as though they were trying way too hard to be serious and it came out as humorous instead. It was actually terrifying in some points until the demon started listening to Tiny Tim near the ending, and then I couldn't help but not take this film seriously.This movie could have been amazing, it really could've. The graphics for the demon were not very good and some of the music felt out of place at times, but this was certainly not the worst PG 13 horror movie I've ever seen. Laughable? Yes, in some parts. It was decent I suppose so it's not one of those movies that makes you want to walk out in the middle of it. Overall, a six out of ten stars seem suitable.",Insidious
767,wolfheinl,A movie of its own genre.,7,4 April 2011,"A movie of its own genre. Insidious is like 2 movies in one. The first half is a introduction to the family. Then the scary stuff starts. Their experiences start as they move into a new house. It starts out as little experiences like books moving, doors opening etc. Then the son Dalton falls off a ladder in the attic and goes into a so called 'acomma'. Now the events really start escalating. Figures are being seen, the house alarms are going off, and then, a bloody hand print on Daltons bed. The family finally has had enough and moves again. But as the ghostly encounters continue to happen at the new house, they decide to call in a psychic and her 2 goof ball assistants. This is when the second movie starts. The psychic tells the parents that Dalton is in some other dimension called 'The Further.' She also tells the parents about the fathers past experiences with a different, witch like demon only seen in photos taken of the father. The father then goes into 'The Further' to save Dalton before a demon possesses him . There he meets many strange demons including the one that haunted him in his childhood. Finally he finds Dalton all chained up and somehow, he magically gets the chains off but now he has to escape Dalton's demon, or, Darth Maul you could call him. But for some reason, the demon is extremely weak and they get away from him easily. As they get back to the house the father comes face to face with the Witch demon. He just tells her to ""Go away"" and she does, or so we think. The father and son get back into their bodies and regain consciousness. As the family is celebrating the return of Dalton, the father and psychic are talking. For some reason, she takes a photo of him and instead of seeing the father, we see the Witch demon that haunted him as a kid. He then strangles her to death. The last scene of the movie we see the mom, who finds the psychic dead. She finds the picture and finds out her husband is now a demon. She then confronts her husband and the movie ends.",Insidious

I started watching this movie and i was pretty excited as i was looking forward to a decent horror/thriller movie. Half way through it i was feeling pretty nervous and tense, the characters were believable the plot was quite thrilling, had a few scares and i liked where it was going. Then it all spiraled down pretty fast, instead of horrified i was feeling giggly, it suddenly turned into a B flick all over the place. The plot got loose the make up and characters design was horrific, and not the good kind, it was predictable as hell, and all around ridiculous. Thats's too bad because it had a pretty good potential and it did feel, for the first half of it at least, like a new take on the genre, that was all over pretty soon and things bot baad, to put it simply.",Insidious
770,laskabom,Over-hyped (Contains spoilers),3,26 April 2011,"This is my first movie review ever, and I felt i had to write this to express how severely over-hyped this movie is. The movie starts out much the same way as the movie Paranormal Activity, a family in a house doing regular things. After a while, some weird stuff starts to happen, and one of their kids have an accident. So far so good. Then the kid falls into a coma. This is where the movie starts to go in the wrong direction. Two nerdy looking guys come in to the house with some instruments to take measurements of whats going on. To me it seemed like these two guys should really have played in some nerdy comedy, and not a (intented) horror movie. However, they call in reinforcements - an old lady who figures out that the kid is really skilled in astral projection, and the problem is that he has floated away and got lost in the astral realm. After this, all sorts of really silly looking ghosts and demons start showing up, especially the one with a red face. To resolve this, the father astral projection as well to look for his son, fist-fighting his way trough ghosts and demons.When I look back at what I have written here, it seems like a really funny concept - material for a humor/horror movie. However, it's not. It tries to be convincing, but instead it becomes embarrassing, annoying and completely unconvincing with its mixture of new-age elements, drama and fist-fights with demons and ghosts.",Insidious
771,josh630,So Much Wasted Potential,5,23 April 2011,"I'll get to the point, and say that the first half of this movie is really well done. From the opening credits to the creepy string music reminding you of when horror films were actually good. The acting is strong and there are even scenes were the characters are strongly developed. Everything sets up nice, and it has that creepy house/ghost story feel to it, mixed in with a little bit of intrigue. The jumps and scenes are queued on time with the music, and the subtle ""scares"" are really this movies shining moment. Actual suspense and fright, minus the gore that so many ""scary movies"" have been pushing out lately.All this sounds like a great movie right? Well, don't get your hopes up like I did. Somewhere along the half way point this movie goes downhill drastically. It wasn't just a personal opinion either because I heard similar murmurs from fellow viewers. Needless to say, by the end of the movie the plot/quality decline and what could have been a great scary movie for the decade, amounted to nothing more than a failed attempt that left me wondering why the directors would make some of the choices that they did.",Insidious

It takes a lot, I've been bored with horror movies for so long.Always knowing what's around the corner, or the cheap scares, no not this movie. The music, oh my gosh. creepy...The shadows the lurk around the corner, and the demon. WOW! I have nothing bad to say about this film. Cinematography along with the sound effects, music, and it's 70's classic look. The title ... nice! Again finally what it's all about... go see this film.",Insidious
773,misskane,Classic example of a hyped up film!,2,12 June 2011,"To my absolute dismay i went and paid full whack at the cinema to see this film - not only have i lost the 1 and a half hours off my life, I'm also heavily dented in my purse! I foolishly listened to some people who thought it was ""really scary and worth it"" and i also took note of the 7.7/10 rating on here...wow, some people really have no taste in horror, either that or they just have money to burn.The film actually starts out quite promising, however it's very obvious that its made by the people from Paranormal Activity (another hyped up load of crap) The shots and even the set are very similar. It's starts off as a fairly modern horror: the usual loose character developments, the half attractive cast, the fairly unconvincing acting...however at this point i hadn't lost hope. Well, that certainly didn't last long.There are a few decent scares in this film, however it soon becomes obvious that the director is just out to make the audience jump, the plot becomes ridiculous and the use of crescendos increases ten fold, really it's just good use of violins! The first half and the second half of the films are complete polar opposites. The second half takes a leaf out of Poltergeists book, the set of a Meatloaf video and I'm sure George Lucas will have something to say about the fact that Darth Maul shows up (really its supposed to be a demon...but the make up is pretty much the same) The scenes become totally ridiculous and totally ruin the work of the first 40 minutes of the film.In a quick conclusion, this film is a bad copy of Poltergeist, certainly not worth a cinema viewing...the scares probably will not transfer well to DVD either. Save your money!",Insidious
774,Dmerritt16,Kooky,3,3 April 2011,"I am flabbergasted that this film is getting the praise it is receiving. I went into this movie only knowing that it was a horror film. I had no expectations or pre-formed opinions. I hoped I could have an open mind. The beginning of the film gave it a feel of Hitchcock/Sam Raimi. Simple scenes. Black and white. The worst parts of the violin being scraped at. The sounds of a grand piano being smashed with a sledge hammer. I applaud the composer of the soundtrack (to which every bit of the three stars I gave are credited) but the story/characters/horror fell flat almost immediately. And soon after the fall, the kookiness began. It was all topped of with an attempt to bring in some unneeded comic relief? I took the Raimi approach but it was no use. The director was serious about his choice to add this aspect to the film and wrong for doing so.I hope no one hurts their eyes by going to see this film. I can say, if you would like, buy a ticket to go see a good film and enjoy the first 3 minutes of this one while waiting for your film to start. The music is well done, but not well placed. Wasted on a crappy film.",Insidious
775,amschroe324,give me a break,3,2 April 2011,"I only give Insidious 3 stars because the beginning of the movie showed promise. This film was absolutely ridiculous. It was like the people from Paranormal Activity did the first 1/2 - which was pretty good, actually had quite beautiful lighting, and was kind of scary - and the people from Saw did the second 1/2, which was plain horrible. After the initial scary parts in the beginning, the only thing that was scary about this film was the loud music and noises. The ghosts were so silly-looking, and the demon was the stupidest thing I've ever seen. He had some shiny facepaint on. It was sooooo silly. And, they used Tiny Tim's ""Tulip"" song as a creepy song??? Really? I mean, Tiny Tim is creepy, but that song isn't. And when the father enters the demon's ""lair"" or whatever the hell it's supposed to be, it looks like the crew went to Pier 1 and bought all of the cheesy, ugly Mediterranean decor they could find and put it in there. And then the demon is dj-ing Tiny Tim and sharpening his nails with the kid chained up in front of the fireplace. Come on. If this was supposed to be funny, I wouldn't have cared so much, but this was communicated in a serious way! I couldn't believe it. I knew the movie wasn't going to be great, but I didn't think it was going to be THAT bad.

If you are looking for something with a deep storyline or something to keep you awake at night, skip this.

Not since Drag Me to Hell have I enjoyed myself so much watching a scare flick. While the formula is a redux of many a ghost story and heavily reminiscent of Poltergeist, the movie still feels fresh and original.The scares in both the cheap and unique variety and it is all in good fun. Gore is definitely underplayed and the visuals and atmosphere are what yank you in and nail your eyes to the screen.Hopefully, the team holds this high standard in what is sure to be a new franchise from the Saw crew (overdone as those movies have become). They certainly have me locked in for Insidious II.",Insidious
778,kitikong,Insidious.....Disappointing Film,5,2 April 2011,"I have to say the first half of the film was really good and deserved 10/10. The plot, cinematography, directing, sounds, and acting were all superb. However, the movie took a wrong turn in the last half of the film (when the whole real story unfolded). It became nothing but a cheap low-budget DVD-type horror film. I realized they made this film with about 1 millions also but that wasn't the reason why the film failed in my opinion. The script for the last half of the film was just so horrible that it ruined the whole movie. The demon looked like Nightcrawler from the X-Men and other ghosts looked just like those you'd find at Disneyland Haunted Mansion ride. The makeup was really bad. The acting of the ghosts (except the demon) was worse. The scenes in the house where the father was searching for his son were totally video-game like. It just made you feel as if the whole thing was shot in a cheap backyard haunted house somewhere. It was very disappointing. The worst scene, in my opinion, was when all the ghosts were coming out into the real world. It was BAD, HORRIBLE, and most of all STUPID. They walked like zombies. Everything looked seriously fake and pathetic. Ghosts trying to come out of a closet, anyone? The ending was stupid as well. Any horror fan could have seen that coming miles away. It was so predictable and unoriginal. I felt cheated.Overall, the film is a disappointment. My advice is to save your money and go watch an episode of the Twilight Zone instead.",Insidious
779,Antonia-gal,just OK,5,2 April 2011,"I was expecting a lot more and actually got more laughs out of the movie than scares :( Some of the ""scary"" characters were a bit ridiculous to me... Only major problem I had was the makeup and costumes needed a lot of work. For me when I actually could see the grease paint on their faces I was pretty disappointed they looked more like clowns then the dead or then anything really scary at all ... it had a great concept and good story line good music... just needed a little help in the make up and costume department if they could just have improved those it might just have been a home run for me. I wanted so much more from the makers of the movie. Pretty much make up costume department failed the makers here...If there were done more more realistic and eerie it might just have taken it to a whole other level...It is worth seeing however.",Insidious
780,thefutureisbulletproof,More of a comedy than a horror film,1,2 April 2011,"I went to see this movie with a few of my friends today. It was a waste of time and seven bucks. I went into this movie without really being certain of how I felt about it. Usually I go into a movie thinking it will be good or that it will suck, but honestly, when I walked into that theater, I had no idea what the movie was about or what it would be like other than an ""it looks scary"" from some preppy chick in my geography class. I will tell you this right now: it was not scary. At all.The movie started with its title being thrown obnoxiously at the screen with Psycho-like music playing in the background. It was annoying and loud and unnecessary. The fact that they continued to do it throughout the movie rather frequently only agitated me more.The movie was predictable and relied mostly on things suddenly jumping out accompanied by humongous banging noises to scare you. However, as soon as you got over the initial shock and saw how ridiculously bad the monster or whatever you were looking at was, you started bursting out laughing. I'm not even kidding. The entire theater was laughing most of the time.Of course, Insidious was not meant to be a comedy, and the worst part is that they continued to try to keep it serious, despite how ridiculous it was. The parts where they attempted to develop the plot were boring, and I spent most of the movie just dying to get out of the theater. It would have been better off if they had originally intended it to be a comedy or you know, a parody of Poltergeist, considering the plots were pretty similar.I'm really not sure how this movie managed to get the rating it has on here, considering it was simply ridiculous. I'm also not sure how anyone managed to find it scary either, considering the entire theater was laughing throughout the duration of the movie. Last time I checked, laughter meant something was funny, not scary.",Insidious

The movie never gets boring or slow, the plot constantly evolves. The horror element was really good up until the monster's form was revealed. That sort of ruined it, because (spoiler) he looks like Darth Maul and a goat had a baby. After that, the movie was still very thrilling, but this is only a horror in the fact that that there are a few scenes where the actors see the demons, and the end where the **** hits the fan. It's a trill ride of endless fun, scared, and an ending that cries 'sequel!' This is the most entertaining movie I have seen in a long time, and highly recommend it to any horror fan.",Insidious

I give it ten stars because I thought it had a good plot, with many surprises and twists. It is definitely not just your average gory slasher film. That is hard to find these days.

I kept finding myself praying that things wouldn't jump out at me, and I even spilled a little bit of my slushy on myself from jumping. As the movie went on I was sinking lower and lower in my seat. The day after, I was ushering at the movie theater I worked at. I go in to clean the theater Insidious was in and my walkie-talkie began to make funky noises like the baby monitor in the movie was.

The story starts very slow and the characters are not well developed. (Spoiler) When the family changes houses because they think their old one is haunted, nobody in my group caught on to that for a bit. Near the end, the demon, who was in sort of a demonic projection room, suddenly appears with a boom and OMG!..there's a close-up of a cloven hoof to let you know that there's a bygollygee demon there!

So when i finally got time today i decided to watch it with my movie pals.First of all the movie overall is scary and actually creates a frightening atmosphere over the course of the film, however when i walked out of the theater i felt somewhat disappointed probably because i was expecting more. The movie contains a few original ideas of its own and takes an unique approach to the horror genre.

I got a shiver as the first title came up. Very good acting lots of jumpy bits and a thrill through out Highly recommend to watch it.

The film starts a little slow, appearing( keyword)to be you're modern cliché ghost/suspense film. It takes a dramatic turn into a demonic science fiction. The film has some truly interesting and terrifying avant-garde displays of demonic and supernatural entities. I felt like some scenes even transcended the movie. The best part is, the ending is not fluffy and bublegumy. People die, they do not live happily ever after. Evil overcomes good.

789,crazy_fraud_lover,Stylistically scary and a bit eccentric,9,9 April 2011,"I've been looking for reviews on here and was surprised at how split the opinions are. People either seem to love it or hate it. For one thing, when you combine the people from Saw and Paranormal Activity, you are likely to have an audience that does not overlap. I personally only really liked the first Saw and I love both PA's. I felt that Saw 2+ became more like Final Destination where each sequel only seemed to push boundaries and create gruesome situations instead of providing a solid plot line. Therefore, I feel that may be part of the rift between opinions.That said, I'll share mine. I was very surprised with this movie. Like many other people said, I thought it would be the type where you could predict everything and always be ready for what's coming. I'm not a screamer and only really cringe at detailed gore, but this movie kept me uneasy until the end. There are moments of comic relief where you can relax momentarily, but not for long.I feel that's worth mentioning. Many people complain that it tries to be too funny at times or over the top. From the title card, it gave me the feeling of a Dario Argento flick, more like his older ones such as Suspiria. I personally find that refreshing. But what I really want to say is that I think this movie includes these moments to show that it's not taking itself too seriously. Not to say it is not scary, but I think it acknowledges that it's a bit humorous and eccentric at times. To me, the eccentricity of some of the characters in the movie, while some may call it cheesy, adds a dose of madness. A character like Michael Myers or Jason Vorhees are straight up scary. But a character like Freddy Krueger is more eccentric and maniacal. Not to say characters in this movie are like Freddy, but insofar as that Freddy is eccentrically scary. His madness is what makes him so scary and I feel characters in this movies possess that same quality. I feel it might be fair to compare them to the style of the characters from Thir13een Ghosts as well.I feel like this movie took a unique idea and executed it well. There were some parts I wasn't sure they could pull off, but I have to say, especially near the end I feel they pulled it off. There were parts that probably could have been progressed further or deeper, but it's not to the point that it ruins the movie for me. I also think the ending has a classic Argento feeling to it and contributes to what I said about it not taking itself too seriously. If you're going to like this movie, you'll likely still be creeped out at the end.I really liked this movie, you may or may not. It depends on what you are willing to accept and what you consider to be scary. I especially am not impressed with movies that over-gore just to show off their great effects, so for this movie being a PG-13, I feel it managed a very high creep-factor without unnecessary gore.Lastly a bit of advice: if you're the type that lingers after the credits...",Insidious

I think the scariest part of the WHOLE movie, was the old lady, i cant get that image out of my head..i don't know why, but it was just so scary. The movie shouldn't be rated PG 13. It should be like, rated R.. Scariest movie ever. It probably wouldn't be so bad on like a small TV, but seeing it on the big screen terrified me. LOL at one part, I punched myself in the face. Something scary happened, and my arm flew up to cover my eyes, and i ended up hitting myself. Anyway, great movie. Waaay scarier than paranormal activity, when i saw the previews for this, it seemed like one of those movies, but it was SO much better. I'd definitely go see it again, and again, and again. Although i may have nightmares for the next few weeks. I'd recommend it to people of any age, as long as they can handle creepy faces, and scary pop out scenes. :)",Insidious

793,beliveau17,TERRIBLE Movie (may contain spoilers),3,18 April 2011,"When the movie opens up (after the longest, most boring intro ever) we are shown several short, choppy clips of what is supposed to be a normal family moving into a new house (like every other scary movie out there). However, with HORRIBLE acting, camera shots, editing, and special effects, this movie is almost worse than Drag Me to Hell. Insidious is pretty much a comedy. I laughed so hard throughout the movie because I realized that they were actually trying seriously to make a horror movie. Well obviously they failed. The best demon they could come up with is literally a spiderman version of Darth Maul. (except this guy spends his time making puppets and sharpening his claws while holding children captive in 'The Further'). Going into the movie with high hopes that finally a decent scary movie was coming out, the scariest part of the entire experience was the trailer for Don't Be Afraid of the Dark before Insidious even started. I do have to hand it to the director though. It was an original idea. a very unique plot, but it was ruined by cheesy lines and acting. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY TO SEE THIS MOVIE. It is not scary at all except for a few moments of loud sounds that make you jump.",Insidious
794,pnutty_Rach,Good movie!,10,18 April 2011,"Omg so this movie isn't what i expected at all. I was a little disappointed in some parts, but it made up for that a great deal. I screamed in the theater (just a little :) for the first time in a long time. Great movie!! It is obvious that this was made from the makers of saw, keep your eyes open for little parts of saw in this movie and you will find them hidden in the background. The acting wasn't too bad, but the storyline its self was just kinda dumb. To be quit honest there were a few parts i laughed it was so bad, but again it made up for it with simple properly placed scary parts that made me jump! Not a movie filled with top actors and expensive CGI,but still worth watching.",Insidious
795,Malirisk,Almost but not quite...,6,11 July 2011,"This is my first review so don't be too harsh. :P When I first saw this film on IMDb and the good reviews of it, I was thinking that this might be pretty damn good flick. And yeah it was enjoyable, but not nearly as good as the first reviews here let you understand. I'm really a great fan of horror not completely relying on cheap scares and blood and gore. Good suspense and real fear is what makes a good horror movie for me. It doesn't need anything else to be good. This film delivers this. Or at least some.The first part of the film was really good. It was steadily building up the suspense with small things. What really got me here was the jump scares though. I was genuinely freaked out for example when the guy was standing over the baby. The sound effects were also great and they built up the atmosphere and the tension really well. Acting was also very well done in my opinion. Characters were realistic enough to get a sense of their fear and emotions. This far I really thought it would be a great movie, but then something just went wrong.When these two nerdy guys came in with their fancy equipment I didn't really know what to think. It was some kind of comic relief in a pretty odd place. Actually it wasn't just odd place. I didn't think it fit the movie at all although some lulz were given to them. And then there were was the ""summoning"" thing, which was okay and interesting to watch even though it really wasn't that scary. But then came the astral traveling to ""The Further"", and everything just went downhill from there. If I would have seen the movie only from that point onwards I would have given 1 star without a moment of hesitation. The idea behind it was okay, but the implementation was just horrible. It looked like some cheap rip-off from Pan's Labyrinth with some lame wax-doll-ghost-things thrown in it. Not to mention the ""demon"", which was just some guy with red face paint and sharp nails. Not even remotely scary. Even some extra cheesy CGI would have been better than that. I don't even want to talk about the ""escape from the ghosts"". The whole thing would have been so much better if it would have been even close to what Pan's Labyrinth ""tasks"" were. But then again it's probably not fair to compare this movie to that, even though I noticed very conspicuous similarities between the two.With all that said I want to say that this was not a bad movie at all. It's not a masterpiece, but it's a great way to spend the night with your better half. :) Even though the second half wasn't all that great, I still enjoyed it a lot and it's definitely worth watching and much better than your average horror flick.",Insidious
796,banny_1982,"they threw the script out and sent the director, editor and actors looking for it",5,24 April 2011,"The story seems classic at the beginning, then it goes wild towards the end. The plot simply loses attraction, 4 or 5 new characters are just thrown into the movie, and, as others have said it, you really don't connect with anyone in the movie. This being said they still could have pulled it off, except that the acting is poor, and the cut is just awful, it just goes from one scene to another with no fluidity, plus the action scenes at the end are cut even worse. Plus a school teacher who gets home at 10:40 pm every night???? It seems this movie was thrown together without a script... I would say Scary Movie 4 has a better chance at becoming a horror classic. I don't see how critics could rave about this movie, it gets 7.4 on IMDb, 6-th sense gets 8.2 ???? give me a break guys.... this is a 4.5 movie at most.",Insidious

I was laughing the whole time! My wife and I looked at each other and wish we could have our money back. It is filled with cheap acting, cheap thrills and the music is basically someone banging on a piano every time there is some monster or creature behind someone or staring at someone.. felt like a rip off of paranormal activity, poltergeist and exorcist in one. The one thing I can't figure out was this movie supposed to really be horror and scary or a comedy? Because if its comedy then I can accept it, but if this is supposed to be scary, man whoever made this movie needs to watch some real movies in that genre. What were they thinking? Please don't make a part 2.. well it doesn't matter to us we won't be watching it.",Insidious

To my surprise 7.4!?!? Also backed up by the directors of paranormal activity and saw. Sooooo what did I do, I gave the film a try. Let me start off by saying the acting is so rubbish a bunch of school kids could of done better. The scare factor is a joke and the story is all over the place.Please don't get me started on the effects and the rubbish application of makeup to make people look dead.This film was a joke if not a load of horse Pooh (which I would consider more valuable).PLEASE LISTEN AND DO NOT BOTHER YOUR LIFE WITH THIS CRAP.YOU WILL THANK ME",Insidious
799,drewserbell,Scary,10,25 April 2011,I thought this movie would be crap because it was made by the same person who made Paranormal Activity but no. This could possibly be the scariest movie i have ever seen. It has a good story too. There were points in this movie where I jumped and screamed in this movie. Not for the faint hearted. If you watch this movie do not bring your girlfriend because she will leave you straight away from the amount of times you scream. There was a point in the movie where they were just talking nicely and then right behind the fella there was a big black and red monster standing right behind him and i nearly crapped my pants. This movie is a really good watch because it has a good story and will scare the balls off you.,Insidious

I feel like what was meant to be scary turned into a joke and a poor one at that. I literally went from being excited/creeped to laughing at how funny the movie turned. I was more frightened watching Killer Clowns from Outerspace. I am one who enjoys the simple things in a horror movie and I think that is what makes them scary, but I feel like too much was thrown in for no reason. I have watched a lot of horror movies in my life and this is up there with the worst of them. While I was in the theater an angry movie watcher stormed out very upset about how bad this movie was. I was very excited to see this movie and felt let down. For anyone who likes a real horror movie I would advise them not to watch this.",Insidious
801,misc905,Bad Knockoff of Spielberg's POLTERGEIST,1,25 April 2011,"It is very clear that the writer of this film had seen Steven Spielberg's classic horror film Poltergeist because this entire film pulls whole cloth elements from Poltergeist and reworks it to a bastardized version. It is as if this film is written and directed by high school kids who saw Poltergeist and thought it would be cool to make their homage to it with their simplistic understanding of how to create suspense and horror. For these Insidious writer/director horror to them is a person wearing scary makeup and sudden loud noises...nothing more. Insidious wants to be Poltergiest but ends up doing everything wrong. And its embarrassing to watch.To no surprise after finding out that this film was made by the people behind Paranormal Activity and Saw i knew right away one would have to check their brain at the door.For me, i can look by bad acting, poor effects, and amateur-hour directing but if the underlying script is terrible then i am going to bash it. And this my friends is serious high school play writing/directing -- the kind of mess where parents go, sit in the audience and no matter how crappy it is you end up clapping and going home half asleep and thinking about other things.To be fair and give you an idea of what horror films i like:Jaws - Poltergeist - American Werewolf in London - Exorcist - Frailty - Tale of two Sisters (foreign film)It's a small list but they are considered classics by critics and viewers alike (check IMDb's ratings for each). They are so loved because each tells a story in a very realistic way and not looking to cheap tricks for scare value. It's professional storytelling.I'd love to discuss Insidious in a scene by scene way as to what a disaster the thing is but i doubt anyone will read my review outside of seeing my rating of it. 1/10...I'd rate this as UNWATCHABLE and spit but IMDb wont let me.If you are an aspiring screenwriter then watch this film and learn what exactly NOT to do.",Insidious

But the camera work and lightning create and excellent effect of a horror genre, and the classic horror build up is seen throughout this movieThe story is unique and astral projection is not often visited within movies, I would recommended seeing this movie as it is worth a watch even with its few flaws hence my generous rating of 7/10, good job.",Insidious

I could not verify this however, I'm sure all the reviewers that have submitted comments for this film were written by people who have not actually watched this movie! I wish I could reclaim back 90 mins of my life, not to mention a refund for hard earned money that was thrown away on this so called 'scary movie'. If you want a fright equivalent to Insidious , just switch of the lights in your house and play loud music with the occasional hysterical scream in the background (that your 5 year could supply at no cost.)

I do NOT recommend it at all. I saw it with a friend and we both thought that it was the stupidest movie ever. The ending was OK but i kinda saw it coming.We both thought that it was hilarious when they showed the word Insidious with screaming violins. It was a complete waste of 7.50 dollars.

From then on couldn't eat my popcorn for the next hour and a bit I was petrified.The whole storyline was pretty standard horror, but those guys really put all their work into making it more than the plot. Without the blood and gore (which I completely expected from the director of Saw), it cut to the sheer terror that the idea of paranormal ""things"" can reach us.It was an absolutely brilliant horror, which still stays with me now (the day after) when opening my cupboards.

810,russell1104,For Me.. Excellent!,10,5 May 2011,"I am truly a Haunted House/Thriller fan. This film had it all. I enjoy being scared by a film (this hasn't really happened lately, other than a few moments in 'Paranormal Activity') 'Insidious' was as scary as they come, and not in a conventional way i thought. The film did not have the typical 'there's some one in the mirror' bathroom scene, which frankly, i thought was incredibly refreshing. 'Insidious was scary because the writers were talented enough to make us, as an audience, care about the Character Development. The first half of the film was full of jumps and scares, and they were done in such a way that they made you even more terrified. For Example, at one point in the movie, the Characters think they are being burgled, or that someone has entered their home, this makes the fright factor even bigger, as sceptics are more susceptible to 'real scares' like a burglary. In a strange way i found the first half of the movie fairly believable (as much as you can believe in ghosts and demons, obviously..) As the film progressed i just got more and more scared,as did the rest of the cinema audience, to the point were i didn't quite no what to do with myself, or where to put myself! I did, in fact have to peep through my fingers at one stage! I have read a lot of reviews about 'Insidious' and they mostly say the same thing, 'Scary, Brill, 1st half Great! Second half, not so great..' The important thing about the second half of the film is this.. Yes, it got a little silly, yes, it didn't leave much to the imagination, but truthfully, the first half of the film reeled me into such a state of horror that i couldn't have cared less about the 'silly factor'Of all the reviews i have read that have disliked the last 20-30 mins of the film, almost all of those said that they were still scared.If its frights you want, and literally a heart-pounding 2hours.

811,djber1994,A solid movie.,8,6 May 2011,"To be honest, I think the only people who didn't like this movie are the stuck-up wannabe critics who like to sit in their rooms and mock everything because it makes them feel like their opinion matters. There was not much to dislike about this movie. The acting was not bad, the effects were pretty good and appealing to see, and I liked the fact that for once a recent horror film did not involve unnecessary blood and violence. It relied on actual suspense. Parts of it were funny, as well. The only thing that may have lacked a little was the way the plot was put together. Parts of the story were truly obscure and almost seemed a little rushed. But, if, unlike said wannabe critics, you can use a small amount of suspension of disbelief, and do not need EVERYTHING to make sense because you have no sense of imagination, you probably will actually enjoy this movie. However, if your response to movies is usually ""HA! That sucked! I could pull a better movie out of my ass! I'm awesome!"", you'll probably hate it and come write a stupid review about it. In my opinion, one of the best put-together, directed, and acted horror movies of recent times. Not a must-see or instant classic, but a solid watch and a fun time.",Insidious
812,loopyloo1988-48-304839,Started so well but went all Drag me to hell funny kinda...,5,8 May 2011,"Usually we have to wait sometime longer for films to hit UK shores and what with the need to be scared in public eye, as much fun and exciting as can be, this just offered the same predictable jumps and silly ghostly appearances in all the wrong places. Largely because the second half of the movies laughable spirit travelling find your son's inner being in a terrorised ghost realm. That for me, and the audiences response to the ending, a wasted story to such a positive and butt clenching start! And what was with the Tales of the crypt fly towards the camera opening title. That was just hilarious!From the beginning offered your run of the mill strange happenings with little signs here and there that something odd was happening, but it was done right at least. Everything felt on edge and the tension was well built throughout the opening. A stereotypical American family of teacher and housewife and some little terrors running about worked nicely and everything felt in place. You knew as soon as Josh (the man of the house) went to work things would kick off. And just like paranormal activity started slowly and pretty frightening. Moving on to when things get a bit naughty and not selling away the plot, one of the most body tingling, face changing, heart pounding moments comes in the babies room behind the cot! Something made me scream inside ""MICHAEL MYERS IS HERE!!!"" but it worked perfectly well. A lot better than Darth Mauls predictable appearances (you'll see what I'm talking about).When things get really bad they call in some ""experts"" who access the situation for what it is and start the magic off where the film sadly takes a nose dive down and down with no sign of ejecting to safety. And as I said before the film, I feel goes to waste when the Psychic, Ghost whisperer so and so expert sends are hero dad into this spirit travelling rescue mission that the funny, and not the scary begins. With plastic looking smirking like you just don't care Ghosts that oozed humour not fear. Was that intentional? I have no idea. But its not what I call scary. So without ruining a ruined end I'll leave that bit for you to see how disappointing just a great starting movie turned into Drag me the hell stupid scares and predicable goings on.

813,chris_nenov_7,"the scariest movie i've seen, and I've seen a lot of scary movies",9,16 May 2011,"Rather than focus on gore and torture like the Saw films, James Wan focuses more on fearsome demonic forces to terrify viewers. Insidious gets all the things that scare us the most and puts it into one film. Eerie fast paced music, horrific demons, and astral projection. There are more than a few things that go bump in the night, and day! In Insidious, Wan uses the day time as a place for demons to show their face as well as we see the horrific red faced demon more than a few times and a man in a black coat as well as a small dancing demon which makes us wonder what the hell is going on until we realize that we're getting scared by the eeriness. Whannell's script is great leading the actors in the right direction of making us anxious and Wan's direction leads us to time and time again become more and more frightened with whats to come in every single scene with out ears covered and feet up off the floor with fear of a loud noise or a hand coming out from under the seat.I am confident this film will scare even the toughest of movie-goers because James Wan has made this film so we can get scared, putting a twist on the haunted house genre and let me tell you, he has succeeded on every level.",Insidious
814,Nongus,A promising disappointment,5,23 May 2011,"This movie is a lazy oddity.When I saw this, the young, energetic and crowded audience responded accordingly. Squeaks and giggles distracted as the hackneyed script ticked all the relevant boxes, relying heavily on cliché excused as references to classics. The faded palette, screeching-string score and stereotyped characters offered nothing new - but so what? This is a fun horror movie, right? No.Okay, it avoids CG and splatter but that doesn't automatically single it out as the kind of movie to creep inside your head and have you keeping the lights on in your bedroom for the next four nights. As a weak reworking of superior haunting/possession classics, this poorly-acted, weakly-scripted movie is a vehicle for jump-gags alone. Granted, a couple of these gags are inventive if you're a fan of the genre but the final 30 minutes had me yawning and patiently waiting for a probable conclusion with the inevitable twist.So you might as well avoid this unless you have a seriously bored rainy afternoon. Insidious is a dull placeholder for those who remember the awe, naked fear, and fascinating paranormal intrigue of Poltergeist.",Insidious

I went with my girlfriend and another couple. All of my friends, when asked about it, had said it was ""the scariest film"" they had ever seen. I took this on board and read some reviews on IMDb the night before. Every single one of them said this was a ""classic horror film"" or a film ""that will leave you having nightmares for weeks"". I went into the cinema weary that this would be correct, but everyone could not have been more wrong.The film was not scary at all and all so very anti climatic. The first (and only) moment in the film that I jumped at came quite a while into in, when the figure appears behind the baby's cot, and despite it coming rather late into the film, I braced myself for more to come. This was not the case and no more ""jumpy"" moments came. The film dragged on quite a bit and the writers could have tried to insert more scary moments. I also read that the music choice of the film made it even more scarier, but again to my disappointment, this was not the case. There was nothing special with the music and sound effects and at the part where the father found the son in ""The Further"" the music did the complete opposite of what it was meant to do. Instead of creeping out the audience, it completely lightened the mood and to me resembled that of a toy factory and a very childly film.I normally get scared very easily at horror movies and so was expecting to get embarrassed in front of my girlfriend at this one but this did not happen. It was very disappointing and did not live up to all the hype that surrounded it and is most definitely not the ""scariest horror film ever"". I would not recommend this film at all.",Insidious

Talk about a massive WTF moment. Since when is anything remotely spiritual genetic? Next we'll find that only fathers can pass on this gift to their sons. I was totally for the movie until the writers obviously ran out of juice and had to recycle that old cliché. 10 stars, really?

I'd say the best actor was the kid in the coma (when he was in that same state) Yet another disgrace to the horror genre.Filmmakers, enough of the creepy kid drawings, enough of kid possessions (kids are creepy just by themselves no need to enhance there creepytud), if your going to recreate a demon entity,evil spirit, diabolical being...etc...

820,mr-flagg,I usually think low voters are just there to bash anything but...,3,19 June 2011,"I regret to say this time I was totally wrong. The movie starts fine and that's why I give it 3 stars. The beginning is quite similar to Paranormal Activity coupled with a quite saddening family drama. If I had to judge from the first 20-25 minutes, this was going to be a great horror movie. The potential is very promising.Sadly that's where things end being any good. The story turns into a cheap fest of loud noises to try and scare people with the BANG!!! since they cannot scare people with the images and story. The ghosts are laughable, and I mean it literally, you DO laugh when you see them. Special mention to Darth Maul, who is depicted as a quite harmless character which can at most crawl at your back and say 'boo!'. He doesn't feel like a threat and his physical appearance is plain lame.Special mention in the comedy section to the ghostbuster couple and the medium and her gas mask.Regarding the reviews, for once, as I said in the title, I have to admit I agree with people giving it a very low score. They are not just being douches and scoring it low to feel special. It is really that bad. People giving it high scores... I can admit a certain % of the population liking it, if they are easily scared and watch it for a dose of seat jumps... but the amount of high scores is so big I can't but feel a bit suspicious about the source of those reviews. Considering there is little to no control to check if reviews are legit or just spammed by advertisers, in this case it seems quite obvious to me something sneaky is going on.In a word, the movie is _bad_. Very bad. Paranormal Activity 1 & 2 are light years ahead of this movie.",Insidious

I admit that at some parts I found my face inside my shirt, but I guess it wouldn't really be the plot that would scare you, it would be the images and the Dark Maul looking thing. I was really expecting to see a movie like ""Paranormal Activity"", and I thought to myself, ""How the heck am I supposed to sleep at night?"" But I slept peacefully and didn't even give it a second thought. It didn't really scare me, but what did scare me is the preview to ""Don't Be Afraid Of The Dark."" I kind of would recommend it, but at the same time I wouldn't.",Insidious

If you are like me and enjoy being scared...then this is the way to go!!!This was a great movie...the actors were very believable and NOT idiotic like the majority in horror films....ugh....The father btw really HOT....great choice Overall, there are so many jumps and scares in this film.

823,casperc-99-516518,A really great Comedy movie !,3,6 July 2011,"Insidious is one of todays really funny and new-thinking comedy-movies. Although it had its scary moments, The acting was humorous and the story was like five other movies blended together... What a refreshing touch! The plot was predictable and all the way from the start it had major fails. Deamons appearing before anybody was possessed and so. This is NO horror-movie. But it was a great laugh indeed! This is a pile of crap, unless you really go for a humoristic film. If you like ""Scary Movie 1-?"" this is definitely a movie for you. Even though I might say, that even Scary Movie has its moments way above the scariest in this film. Fail! Fail! Fail... Way, way overestimated!",Insidious
824,sakesugaregg,Predictable and Boring; gave me a headache!,1,9 July 2011,"Thank goodness we went to go see this at the cheap theater because otherwise I would be so angry that I wasted my money. Usually, even if the movie isn't great, the experience itself is okay, but this movie gave me a headache (literally!) Like others have said, it starts out a little promising, but turns into a complete disaster. It was just a downward spiral into a throbbing headache for me.There were some interesting parts when the movie wasn't actually trying to make fun of itself, but they were always spoiled by some horrible interruption. The scares are ENTIRELY predictable. The camera always pans in and moves slowly, a reused tactic that I caught onto right away. At every shocker moment I was thinking ""great, something else is going to pop out. Oh look, I'm so surprised, I totally predicted that."" All of the scares are completely unrelated and the fact that the location changes drastically left me feeling isolated from the family-bonding connection. The ending was laughable; I ended up feeling NOTHING for any of the characters.The ghosts/spirits and tactics were overused. There is nothing creative about the imagery AT ALL. The entire second half of the movie seemed to shift from building family values to humor, and then the plot started to turn in on itself. You can't mix that kind of humor with horror without the movie turning into a parody. With an unstable and translucent genre, escaped family morals, and overused/generalized horror that was predictable at EVERY corner, this entire movie was less of a picture and more of a train wreck. My poor head...",Insidious

Cue a cast of undead tortured souls: creepy twins; an old lady veiled in granny-net curtains; a demon luridly covered in black and red face paint like a juggler on ketamine at a rave, most preposterous and unterrifying of the lot. Perhaps aware that they have a largely scare-free experience on their hands, the film-makers insert a comedy sideshow: a psychic who is more Avon lady than exorcist, accompanied by two geeky assistants..",Insidious

And I am a person who isn't really scared that easily. But this movie was great. It made me jump several times, I was even scared to go to the bathroom. This was better than a lot of those R rated movies. And parents, don't hesitate to let your teens watch. They use very minor profanity in this movie. I am looking forward to Insidious 2, I really hope they have one. :) This is now one of my favorite movies. I adored the plot. This is one of those movies that you probably don't want to watch alone unless you're looking for a scare. But it's very interesting. Your eyes will be glued to the screen the entire time. Get your popcorn ready and put this bad boy into the DVD player!",Insidious
827,gators0517,"very good first half, not sure why everyone thinks the second half was so great",6,15 July 2011,"I was pretty excited about this film. Didn't get a chance to see it in the theaters but all of the reviews I read talked about it being a really good horror film that keeps things simple. I'm not a fan of stuff like Saw, Hostel, and other torture porn kinds of stuff. I enjoy a good ghost thriller, haunted house kind of thing (Blair Witch, The Others, The Shining).So, the positives first. I thought the first half was good, nothing particularly ground breaking but nicely paced and staged. The opening credits are cool and when the title hits, I was reminded of Suspiria and other off beat 70's horror pics. The simple hints that were dropped at the beginning (dad isn't in any of the family pictures, kid draws odd pictures that mom and dad think are cute but obviously are a little too weird to be ignored) served to create a bit of an ominous atmosphere. The weird events that happen at night are staged well and provide some good, startling moments. I was excited to see where it was all headed.During the 2nd half, things seemed to turn a bit odd and honestly, kind of comic. I thought the set up was good with the grandmother and psychic providing some interesting weirdness to the explanation of the kid's coma as an extended astral projection where his soul was trapped by a demon. The initial stuff in the kid's room with the psychic describing the demon and the subsequent séance with the gas mask and such was really good, and staged well (though it got a bit goofy at the end).Once the dad projected into the dark world to rescue the son, things just kind of went down hill. Everyone said this last 30 minutes was the scariest stuff, but it was just like some kind of bad carnival ride. The mannequin looking people murdered by another mannequin looking woman. The weird guy with half a face that the dad eventually just tosses across the room, that was kind of dumb. But then, when we actually encounter the demon, he's like an even cheesier version of the demon in Jeepers Creepers (and that's hard to do). Sharpening his nails while weird music plays. Another example of a scary villain that isn't scary once revealed fully. People need to watch Alien to see why less is more in the monster department. Plus, honestly, the demon looked too much like Darth Maul.So, there isn't actually a battle between dad and demon. Dad just runs like hell, gets lost in the dark, finds a way back to the house and then suddenly, there's the witch woman who hounded him as a child. The solution, dad stares in the mirror and yells, yep he yells at her. Just a throwaway scene. And then of course, when all seems right with the world, guess what...dad is actually now possessed by the witch and is going to kill his whole family...fade to black.So, it's fun and I think plenty of people will find the whole thing frightening but I just don't get why some people think this is the scariest film they've ever seen. But hey, to each his own I suppose.",Insidious
828,aarongrantnwa,On the right track....,5,21 July 2011,"Insidious started out as a standard haunted house/possessed movie and was doing a great job of it. It was using a simple but effective formula of slowly building up the scares. Something that a lot of new horror misses is the fact that the anticipation leading up to the scare, the suspense, is where the movie is made. The first half of the movie did this very effectively. Then, all of a sudden, they tell a short and thrown together back story as to why everything is happening the way it is and go totally in a different direction. The second half of the movie is mostly gimmicks with one obvious twist after another and even gets hard to watch at times. While the first half of the movie is almost great, the second half is quite awful. Another great example of an opportunity missed.",Insidious
829,Dmk327,Horrifying movie with a very lackluster finish,6,31 July 2011,"I am not a proponent of giving out any details of a movies plot in a review due to it setting an expectation to another person. The movie has a great plot and theme. The degree of suspense is set high and for a lot of the movie kept me on my toes and had me wanting to take shelter under my blanket if I was still a child. The fatal flaw is that towards the end, and note I am not stating specifically the ending, the movie seems rushed and as if the producers were running low on the budget. If rating the movie from beginning until before the last 15-20 minutes this film would be an 8.5-9. All in all, I would say this movie is well worth the 2 hours you will have to sacrifice from your busy life to enjoy and is a welcome title to a genre that has in the past decade been polluted with mostly cliché garbage.",Insidious

It starts out good, s.fx's are good, even above average, good plot; I'm thinking this may be a good new scary movie. Boy was I wrong!!! Halfway thru the movie, it gets just straight up ridiculous, effects wise. While the plot & story line remain good, the special effects are awful, literally a guy in a mask. It was almost like they didn't have enough money left to invest in the back half of the movie so they just improvised. Save your time, save your money!! The only reason I give it 5 of 10 is for story line & actors, they did a good job with what they had to work with.",Insidious

We curled up in bed, in the dark and put on the movie. What ensued was 90+ minutes of us hiding behind cushions, screaming and generally jumping 3ft off the bed. This is a horror like old school horrors, there is no blood and good, just a good old scare fest that happily trundles along keeping you entertained as it goes.We really did enjoy it, the only downside was having to sleep with hyper, wriggling teenager daughter who was still so wound up she couldn't sleep in her own bed!",Insidious
832,drakrats,Plagiarism at it's worst,5,9 June 2011,"Whilst i quite like movies like this, the supernatural chiller, as opposed to the all out gore and yuckfest that is the Saw movies et al I'm surprised this movie ever got the green light to go ahead and get made. A blatant rip off of Poltergeist and not a very good one at that. The only difference and the only reason i can think of that it got made at all was that it didn't have anything to do with Native American burial grounds....although i wouldn't be surprised if they made an appearance in the obligatory sequel. The movie sustained some kind of tension but that tension is rather to do with my annoyance at the alarmingly similar set pieces that recreate Poltergeists. I don't want to give anything away to anyone who hasn't watched this more to warm them that what they are about to watch is by no means original and by no means a 10/10 film. Do yourself a favour and watch the best movie of this kind and rent/download/borrow or steal Poltergeist.

834,cara_mia_1991,A Great Insidious Surprise,9,13 September 2011,"I had heard many good things about this film in particular recently, and considering the hype that many websites had about it. So as most, I began to watch it with an open mind, with very little information about what the film was initially about, hoping it would be a better surprise, and my gosh it was. Some parts had 'cheesy' FX however, for the most of it, it was a different storyline to most that I have seen of psychological horror. One particular niggle i had about the film was the ghost/spirits that were 1950's men and women. For the costume and make up, it was pretty shabby. They were more like zombies than 'spirits' and for the ending of the film, it was quite a disappointment, bad filming angles, and lighting/FX on the 'Zombies'. Other than that little niggle, fantastic film, great storyline, great FX otherwise, and overall a jumpy, adrenaline based psychological horror, to go in the pile of other greats :)",Insidious
835,carsoccer,"***Hands down best.. scares me, the un-scareable",9,26 January 2013,"Do not expect gore, gimmicks, and other things their previous films had. This is new. This is what horror is all about.I am a scare lover, and i suppose over this course I have become desensitized; nothing scares me hardly. But this did. For most people I talked to, this movie stuck with us, the unsettling feeling. Even going to see it multiple times, knowing what was going to happen, it was terrifying. See, true horror is an art; it relies on subconscious cues and perfect timing. Most 'scary' movies basically announce scares with cues that we all have come to pick up on, (music, silence, camera angles). We hold our breath in preparation and are not scared. Insidious never lets you be ready for anything. The combination of an AMAZINGLY disturbing soundtrack and never really having 'safe scenes' sits you on your utmost edge of discomfort and stress, creating true terror. The timing is so that your brain, after years of 'scary movie' training, subconsciously guesses wrong when and what will happen. This makes ALL THE DIFFERENCE.I will say you must go into the movie wanting a journey, an experience, and a desire to be scared to enjoy it. Don't be a critic, just enjoy it. Watch this if you want a new experience, a different take on terror, not blood. It is a work of art and A lot of fun!",Insidious

I was really fixed on it, really enjoyed it, jumped a few times and grabbed my face in horror at some scenes. scared me more than paranormal activity.

837,Mark_Ard,Some of the worst acting I've ever seen.,3,24 September 2011,"I was extremely excited about viewing this film. partly because of the massive publicity it got and also the trailer for the film was pretty intriguing. Unfortuantly I didn't get a chance to see the film in the cinema so my only other option (which I was happy to do so) was to buy the DVD when I came out.After my excitingly anticipated walk to the shops to buy the film I then watched it that night. With my popcorn ready and my big bottle of 'share size' Coke beside me I was finally ready to watch the 'best horror of the year'. However, my excitement for the film ended within the first 15 to 20 minutes of the film and justifiably the main reason why I rated this so low. The acting in this film is (and this is me putting it lightly) absolutely atrocious. Considering this was such a highly rated film its save to say after not even viewing the first half hour that this film was not all it cracked up to be. The story line for the film was generally good and was quite intriguing and not something I had seen before. (I haven't seen many paranormal films other that Paranormal Activity) Even though I felt that the film was not as good as it was made out to be I am still glad I have view mearly for the fact that it would have bugged the hell out of me if I hadn't on the bases of the hype if had got. I feel that with a lot better acting this film could have been a whole lot better.Overall: Majorly disappointed.",Insidious
838,jordan_widdison,Worst movie ever.,1,8 October 2011,"I did not like this movie at all. I thought the beginning was great, and I thought it was going to be another Paranormal Activity kind of thing, but when they started on the little boy being trapped in astral projection kind of just ruined the movie for me. Also, the hands coming out of the drawers and the demons standing there. I would rather see drawers being thrown at someone by an unseen presence, or reflections in the mirror by a demon. This movie does not have any kind of scare factor whatsoever, and I would never recommend anyone to watch this movie. The directors/writers of this movie I don't think were really all there. Why would someone create that? I don't understand how a little boy being trapped in an astral world would be scary. This would be more of a sci-fi movie, than a horror movie.",Insidious

Not the best acting and especially Lin Shaye is difficult to take serious after all her appearances in Farrelly movies. But still a GREAT horror movie. It's scary in the same way as The Ring. The concept of ""The Further"" is a bit weird, but perhaps they had to invent something new, so it wouldn't be a complete ripoff off Poltergeist.Conclusion: Watch it, if you like movies like The Ring.

It is an edge-of-your-seat, scary, believable horror, not like those cheesy predictable films so common in this genre. The first scary scene is where the mother hears voices on the baby's monitor. The sound effects and incidental music are brilliantly done, as are the lighting and camera work. All work together well to create a tense, ethereal, creepy feel to the entire film. The acting is good enough not to distract away from the feel, as sometimes in movies this is wont to happen, and likewise the script is in keeping with the overall sense of the terrifying unknown realm. The producers give the film a little bit of comic relief in the idiosyncratic features of the two 'specs' who visit with the psychic woman, but have timed it perfectly to give viewers a real ride through an array of human emotions with full effect. Just when your heartbeat has returned to a normal speed the film sets it racing once again! The film is paced well and remains engaging throughout it's entirety.",Insidious
841,poopdog887,Why is everyone so scared?,7,5 December 2011,"Given how many people crapped their pants from this movie, I'm anticipating negative feedback...For a thriller it does a decent job, at least some of the time. I found myself feeling pretty scared during the first third of the movie, but then it suddenly transitions from frightening to weird. With the introduction of some comic relief characters, the movie begins its downward slope (in my opinion). I was initially refreshed to have the scary mood lifted, but it never returned...I recommend watching this movie, but don't expect it to be the scariest thing in the world. Again, don't know why so many people were crying about this movie.One other thing... I don't understand why many reviewers said the scare tactics were unique. They were not at all novel...

842,zombieamour,"Scary, if you've never seen a horror movie before.",2,23 December 2011,"In all honesty, I thought this movie was appallingly bad. So bad, I laughed the whole way through! Insidious was a joke of a movie, the first 20 - 30 minutes were pretty interesting, and I thought that it would be a great movie. But unfortunately, I was wrong.Throughout the whole film, they've taken little parts from different movies like Poltergeist and the Exorcist, which sounds like it'd be pretty enjoyable, but somehow, teamed with silly little demons and music that's just way too dramatic for its own good, they found a way to make you want to jab your eyes out with a ballpoint pen.The acting was just awful, and too dramatic - at times, I felt like I was watching a lame horror special of The Bold And The Beautiful. The only actor who was remotely good was the little boy, and that's because he was in a coma for the majority of the time and didn't talk much. The demons and ghosts were laughable - oh wow, a demon that looks like it was trying on some of its mum's makeup - QUELLE HORREUR!The only part that even remotely scared me in the movie was when the weird demon family all sync in this massive grin - and that was still lame. The entire movie was just way too predictable, and just too over the top.The only thing I don't regret about watching this film is that thankfully, I didn't have to pay for it. At the beginning, I won't deny it, this movie had potential - but the creators of it just tried so hard to make it something it wasn't.The only reason I'm rating it 2/10, is because I got a few laughs out of it.",Insidious

It's kinda B movieish but really good with a budget of $1.5 million dollars it's pretty low however it's pretty decent. It kinda combines Poltergeist (though defiantly not the extremely high budget), Paranormal Activity, and The Exorcist all into one with a little of it's own elements. Overall good movie I just hope they don't ruin it with a bad sequel. It obviously needs a sequel I just hope it's not a bad one. Another thing is that it's rated PG-13. What?! Yep it has a PG-13 rating and it's still scary. I've always praised PG-13 horror movies because 1.There is either very little violence or none at all. 2. It's scary without being gory to where you're not flinching at every kill scene but every time there's something scary you're just numb. 3.Every scare is specific; and finally 4.

Going into this movie, I listened to those people who said the movie was trash and I had low expectations. This movie exceeded my expectations. I was scared, excited, and full of suspense. The acting was great and the designs of the creatures were great. The only thing that stopped the movie from being a 10/10 was the amount of originality.

Just another run of the mill horror movie.",Insidious
846,gaffersgator,I had trouble sleeping when I first saw this movie...,7,4 October 2016,"Horror movies have taken a whole new turn into being terrifying. This is not your average horror movie where there is a killer and a group of teens who get picked off one by one. This movie brings something forward that other paranormal movies have never done before. The young child in this movie does not get possessed by an evil spirit like in ""The Exorcist"", and this is not just another ""Paranormal Activity."" This movie contains something many parents can be afraid of when their children go to sleep, and make them worry if they are ever going to wake up. ""Insidious"" tells of a young boy in which there are several different things that bring it together such as the characters in the movie, and the biggest component... the sound and setting. ""Insidious"" is the peculiar tale of a child who has special dreams and can leave his physical body, however, one day he just never wakes up. For starters yes, this movie may seem corny, or lame to some viewers, but this movie is a genuinely ghastly experience. This movie takes a parents love and protection of their children to the real test. It makes them think of what can really happen when they are helpless and cannot do anything for their child, or newborn. There are two key characters in the movie; Elise the psychic, and Josh, Daltons father. Elise has an amazing performance and the way she brings forth her shaky and bloodcurdling words just makes the viewer realize how serious the situation really is. Then Josh really shows how sometimes parents like to be in denial when they are scared. He denies all of the bad things happening around the house, until they affect him, but also refuses to listen to his wife Renai. He does not take the time to process the severity of the situation and do what is best for his family. The son Dalton could have been sold better. Yes the child seems scared but on the other hand the acting seems fake and uninteresting. Renai is virtually useless because nobody listens. So she just freaks out urges the necessity of help with her voice going virtually unheard. If there was anything that really made the movie, it would definitely have to be the setting, and sound. The house in the movie is constantly quiet unless there is talking; there is no wind, nor creaks or squeaks. Then out of no where there is a flurry of violins or pianos when the scene is getting intense... There is whispering on the baby monitor when there should be nobody in the room. I do not think I can stress enough that one of the most creepy and uneasy parts of the movie is how they can take such a harmless song and turn it so evil and scary. ""Tip Toe"" sounds like a children's song about carelessly frolicking through flowers and playing by an open window. However, when combined with the eerie and empty setting of someone home alone in a house this song creates true anxiety. Especially when it starts playing on an old gramophone on its own.. Then towards the end of the movie this song starts playing when the evil entity is keeping the young child hostage in the dark place in Dalton's dreams, or ""The Further."" The unknown plays one of the most important roles in the movie. Along with the sinister atmosphere, when the psychic Elise has to contact Dalton she puts on an old gas mask with a hose running from the mouth to her analysts ears. You never know what is being said until you see what he writes... or draws. In one scene they are in Daltons room and Elise sees a black figure, and it's the same one Johns mother saw in a dream who said it wants Dalton. Then in another scene Daltons brother says he is afraid to sleep at night because Dalton, who might I remind you is in a deep coma, gets up and walks around during his slumber. Throughout the movie it gradually gets less and less interesting disappointingly. In all honesty the plot could have been better and as I said before even the cast could have been more carefully chosen. There was really only one true amazement in the movie, and that was the ambiance and atmosphere from all the sounds and the way the movie makes you feel. I feel as though there could be something here in the future of horror films if they continue with this style. So, why not travel with me into the further?",Insidious
847,meg-297-54457,Promising start but intensity spoiled half way through by unoriginal tropes and poorly conceived images.,5,20 February 2012,I was really looking forward to watching this film. The trailer looked good: an interesting take on child possession. Good intensity built in the first half - helped by the obvious denial of husband that something was not right in the house. Liked the seeding that he had a past that was obviously going to emerge as the story unfolded....and it did. But what spoiled it entirely for me was the appearance of two lone gunmen/ghost facers types (thanx to X Files and Supernatural respectively)who for some reason seemed to be there to give comic relief. Intensity gone. Enter the medium (Poltergeist here we go again) and the film begins to unfold mechanistically. Static stills of the 'ghosts'from the endless camera flashes show these literally as cheap shots rather than well crafted and wholly conceived images.Josh's past was an interesting take but the whole thing totally overwhelmed by a young director who I don't think was able to take his genre seriously. Compare this to Whedon or McG (who seem to be BIG influences) who would never allow a gag to reduce the awful intensity of the moment.The description of the raison d'etre of the creatures (in the documentary reel) was mind-bogglingly pretentious. An example of how to talk up mediocrity.,Insidious
848,badtzjack-332-608966,Wake Me Up When It's Over...,1,13 May 2013,"So boring. The cure for insomnia. So many people liked it because they'll watch anything in these times. Leave it to the reality show generation. Well, like the old saying goes, there's no accounting for taste. And when will films every be in ""color"" again. So much grays and darkness. It's monotonous already. (And that mother in the film by the way, annoying and trying to pretend she could sing. She didn't even have a good speaking voice. When she comes down the stairs in the beginning of the film, I thought she was the boy for a minute in those kid pajamas).Why are actors so unappealing and dull in the last decade?",Insidious
849,lilithbatcat,Insidious Review,5,12 August 2012,"The first 40 minutes of this film are exceptionally good besides the lead actress's performance. I could tell she was acting, her facial expressions bared no emotion while investigating the noises in the house or the things she saw out of the corner of her eye. Everything in this film is decent (again, aside from the acting) up until the investigation team shows up. From there it goes downhill. The two girls seen while Tucker was looking around with the special lenses in the camera are unbelievably fake and provide no scare whatsoever. The explanation of astral projection seems rushed, as well as when Josh's mother reveals the photos of the old woman that would show up in the background of near every photo token of him. Before the investigation team arrived, this movie was great. Afterwards, not so much. After they take hold of this situation everything seems rushed and loosely put together. Now, another thing that really bothered me while watching this film was the way it was shot. Rather then use a separate camera for shots of (for example) Josh running up the stairs after Renai, it appears that they instead chose to just swing the same camera around and then follow him up the stairs. I felt as if the happenings in this movie where filmed by a guy with a camera, very much like the ones in Paranormal Activity. The ending twist seemed predictable, as I figured that either Josh or Renai would be possessed by one of the demons in the house. I do have mention my favorite scene in the movie. My favorite scene is when Renai is throwing the trash out in the new house, as she walks around the house to the trash can - the music on the record player changes and a little boy is seen dancing to the music. When I saw this, I did jump a little. The designs for the main demon remind me a lot of Darth Mal from the Star Wars films, or rather is facial features. It does provide some good jump scares, and I think the story in decent as well. I'd definitely suggest checking it out.",Insidious
850,emma_phage,Really worth watching,8,4 May 2012,"I really enjoyed this movie. It was very scary and kept me covering my eyes almost the whole time. It seemed to be a mash up of numerous famous horror movie plots, however, it still did a great job putting them altogether. Although, some parts were a little eye rolling, I think this is one of the best horror movies I have seen in a very long time. This movie had serious suspense and scares without requiring lots of gore or CG. I really look forward to what James Wan puts out next, especially considering what he did with the limited budget for this movie . I recommend any horror fan to give this one a shot. I thought this movie was so good I actually created an IMDb account just to review and recommend it.",Insidious
851,info-2446,And it started out so well...,5,17 October 2015,"All the other reviews here seem to be torn between 1* down-votes and 10* praises, which I find both in most cases as good indicators for poor reviews. So I'll try to just lay out what I liked and what I disliked about this movie.Having seen (and loved) The Conjuring a couple of weeks ago, a friend told me to go and watch Insidious, which I just did. Coming from the same director both movies share a good portion of their recipe. A somewhat haunted house, elements of classic horror like Poltergeists and Exorcism mixed with (more or less) modern technology and last but not least a nice share of subtle comedy.Insidious starts out great. There's not much time spent on building up the horror, you'll get your first scares within the first 5 minutes or so. And they are done very well and very unexpected. It plays with the clear portrayal of monsters, but just for the glimpse of a second, as well with blurry, shadowy characters wandering in the background. Weird noises, opening doors and the constant beep from the heart monitor of a kid in a coma make up a great mix for a horror flick. I'll be honest: I jumped in my seat a couple of times and had a good laugh about it, it's a very enjoyable kind of horror.But after about 30 minutes or so something changed. To avoid spoilers I'll put it in general terms: The introduction of somewhat comical characters would have worked for me, what bothered me most was the added amount of cheesiness. I still cant point my finger at it, but it starts to get so cliché at every aspect, that even the portrayal of demons and ghosts which I liked in the first place gets spoiled by it. It kinda felt like the author suddenly realized his paper is due tomorrow. What was built up with care and sweet horror in a calm environment lost itself in a disposable teeny horror. Given explanations and actions didn't feel very satisfying and there were a lot of loose strings left.Long story short: I felt honestly sad about the outcome of this movie, it started as a well made horror shocker and ended up like cheap BO-horror as scream and the likes.",Insidious
852,oceanlife2020,One of the best!,10,13 July 2011,"I was highly surprised when I recently watched this movie. I was under the impression that it was a suspense/thriller, but I was happily surprised to find out that it was indeed a horror film. I have almost given up in past years trying to find a movie that was actually scary, but this movie did it. Absolutely excellent plot, very true to life and believable. The actors were great, everything about this movie was perfect. And unlike many other recent movies that end horribly this one had a good ending also. I try to see all the scary movies as they come out and I can definitely say that this one has something that puts it far above the rest. Let me just say that this movie not only kept me up late at night but woke me up and had me sitting on the edge of my seat. Highly recommended!",Insidious
853,reddrank82,Don't waste your time,1,19 June 2012,"The only thing scary about this movie is that I will never get my 103 minutes back. The story line is great, COULD have been great. A lot more could have been done with this story line and it is really a shame. The effects were terrible (almost laughable), not at all what I was expecting from the same people that created Saw. Almost nothing happens during the first half- yes- HALF of the movie and I considered just turning it off them. Should have because it was extremely boring. I have a very active imagination and am usually very afraid of most horrors movies and this just did not deliver. I cannot believe the amount of wonderful reviews this movie has! I thought for sure I would be having a sleepless night but quite the opposite. If this is what horror movies are coming to then I am done watching them.",Insidious
854,rohaque,One of the worst films I've ever watched.,1,19 August 2012,"There are moments in films which make you respect it. And there are moments in it which make you lose all respect for the movie. In Insidious's case, it's the latter. Whether it be atrocious screenplay consisting of the characters having to explain the whole plot to you, or the main antagonist making you laugh several times in a supposed horror film; this film had too many bad moments to render the whole thing unwatchable.The acting was below standard, the plot had too many irrelevant bits,the only thing scary about this film is how so many people gave it a good review in this site.DON'T WATCH THIS MOVIE UNLESS WATCHING HORSE CRAP MOVIES GETS YOU OFF!",Insidious
855,nunesjoshua,So much potential but eventually falls flat,3,31 August 2012,"This is my first review at IMDb and the reason i'm writing one is because of a review I checked here saying it was so scary that I would not get sleep and that it falls in league with the exorcist.This movie had so much potential to be a good horror movie, it started off really well with me being haunted by the mere intro, however inbetween you find yourself thinking "" such a pity, this is where it stops being scary "" The actors were horrible, the dad being the worst, followed by the dad's mother, the psychic and mainly the kid in the coma. They weren't believable to the point that you can feel like you're watching someone act rather than feeling like you're watching a horror movie. The movie falls flat when they introduce the ""realm of the further"" and start talking about ""astral projections"" the apparitions were funny and oh my god flaming lizard man takes the cake, I actually started laughing when the dad enters the further .I gave the movie a 3/10 because as horrible as it is the movie still has decent starts that will make u jump a bit, other than that it will NOT leave you with nightmares or keep you awake in the night .I can say now that I will be sleeping peacefully and I can even go to the bathroom with the lights off. What a waste of time.",Insidious
856,cannmann21,Snoozer,1,13 October 2012,"If you want to rent this movie - i would recommend seeing poltergeist instead. The premise and concept is the same as poltergeist although a little cheesier. If you have previously seen poltergeist you would be extremely disappointed in this movie. The acting is somewhat bland and the storyline is overly predictable. The special effects were OK at best, which is faint praise for the amount they spent to develop this film. I would have expected much better than the few parlor tricks and simple props they used in the movie.The majority of the audience left well before the movie was over. I was one of the few people in the theater to sit it out (my date wanted to stay). Most patrons left and went into a different movie (one of the benefits of seeing a bad movie at a multi-plex). I am puzzled by the average/slightly above average reviews. My only explanation is most of the reviewers must not have seen poltergeist. I realize there are few, if any, new ideas in today's movies. This movie is just another unoriginal flick trying to put a slightly different spin on an older story. Your red-box dollar is better applied to renting poltergeist.",Insidious
857,nputoober,Awesome movie,9,26 October 2012,"I just watched this movie tonight, and wow it was great. it wasn't extreme scary being a PG-13 movie but for a movie with that rating it has a lot of scares. the suspense it build throughout the movie is great, it does have the odd creepy moment but it is mostly just pure scare. It is nothing completely original, but considering the budget it had and the rating they did an excellent job with what they could. there was no grossing out scenes that are gory at all. very clean movie that way, everything I expected the movie to be it was and more. at first i thought it wouldn't be that scary with a pg13 rating but it proved me wrong about that quick. it is the best scary movie i have seen in a very long time.

858,jimmy-carr78-515-421742,Finally!,6,29 October 2012,"I watched this for the first time the other day. I was expecting a crappy, wannabe horror film. I've been through the jokes of movies that dare call themselves ""horror,"" such as Step Father, Chernobyl Diaries, Deadly Silence, and (my LEAST favorite) The House at the End of the Street.I was expecting to see a lot of the same mystique. The whole ""What was that!?"" When everyone watching knows it was the bad guy. This film actually was done a LOT differently.I was surprised to learn that this was done by the guys who made Saw, knowing full well the twisted minds that the Kings of all Horror Films. Instead of the barrage of visual horror, used rather effectively in every one of their films, they use psychological more often than not, and do it rather well.How ever, this is not the best film to walk off the movie lot. Yes it's entertaining, yes it does succeed in scaring you, but it's another one of those films that you can go with out seeing, and still be okay. How ever, I am excited to FINALLY see proof that there is still hope for the horror genre after all!",Insidious
859,got_SMURFED,A great film,9,15 December 2012,"This is a great horror film. At first i didn't think that this film would be my cup of tea but as the film progressed, it grew on me more and more. The acting in these films is usually bad but this over exceeded my low expectations by a large margin. The producers did a great job on this one as they included little signs that built up suspense. An example is The subtle use of the colour red that made me know something of a demonic nature was going to appear. At first I thought that it was going to be blood but considering the rating I doubted it. My beliefs were confirmed when the devil creature was seen and it gave me quite a fright. Overall personally i would advise watching this film if you are fan of other similar titles e.g. the 'Paranormal Activity' series.",Insidious
860,schontyl,"Save Your Money, Not Worth The Hype",1,11 June 2013,"I rented ""Insidious"" by believing all of the hype I heard stating how ""scary"" the movie was. In short, this movie disappoints on so many levels.First, there is not a real impending sense of danger in most of the movie. The filmmaker seems to think that doors opening on their own and faces popping into the window is enough to scare you.Second, they kept the father in the movie a skeptic for too long and played along the basic horror clichés.Third, they essentially ripped off both ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" and ""Poltergeist."" Seriously, they even had Lin Shaye who played a teacher in ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" in this movie. I have nothing against Lin Shaye and admittedly, she is the bright spot of this bore fest.Fourth, they tried to add humor too late in the movie. If they would have maybe put more humor in the not scary silent (believe me, there are times where nothing is happening at all) parts of the film, maybe it would have been better.Fifth, there a character that just completely disappears in the movie. Now this is not a spoiler or anything. One of the children of the main characters is not seen again at about half way through film. Granted, he was very important to the story but he is noticeably gone.If you are easily scared by ghost children jumping out of closets or people seemingly in danger but perfectly fine a minute later or if you like ""The Blair Witch Project"" or ""Paranormal Activity"" then this movie is for you. But if you desire a little more meat on the bones of your horror film, then definitely choose something else.And of course there will be a sequel. Only time will tell if it is as bad as this one.I rented this movie for 99 cents and let me tell you what, I want my money back.Now, if you do like the movie, please don't attack me for this is merely my opinion on the film.",Insidious
861,pbubalo,Yawn!!!!!!,1,24 December 2012,"This would have to be one of the most unoriginal, unimaginative and predictable ""horror"" films I have seen in a long time!Seriously, if anyone over the age of 15 finds this movie scary they seriously need to get a life and develop an imagination!Everything about this film is totally unoriginal and has been done at least a dozen times before.Right from the start we have the usual cliché of a loving, unsuspecting family who move into a large house with their adorable kids. Its so innocent, boring and lame that you just know evil lurks around the next scene. And of-course, it all starts with the kid.....who would have guessed???Then we have our usual period of scary things going on, doors opening, shadowy figures appearing, objects being flown around the place, etc, etc, etc. All this is followed by the standard team of ghost busters, starting off with the local priest, and moving on to the clairvoyant and her special powers. Then off we go on a scary journey to the dark side and to fight the forces of evil and rescue the young and innocent child. Whooooooo No need to bore you with the rest of the predictable details as im sure anyone with half a brain can work out the rest.I found some of the so called ghosts particularly amusing, One looked as if he escaped from a Goth party. I also found the clairvoyants gas mask/ghost communicator also amusing.Needless to say, this film put me to sleep on more than one occasion, and robbed 102 minutes of my life!Go watch ""Scary Movie"" instead, its more entertaining and probably less predicable.",Insidious
862,clee199283,Scariest movie I've ever seen,10,9 March 2013,"This was a movie that seriously scared me. I got very uncomfortable in the theater. Had the scariest most unsettling vibe ever when I first saw it. There was one part that I literally got an empty feeling where it scared me so bad. Even at the first of the movie I was scared just the feeling it gave me. The music was even ridiculous. It took a very open mind to make this movie. Insidious is a movie that will creep you out and make you think more than actually scare you. Yeah it made you jump a lot throughout the movie, but there were many scenes that were just too creepy. I loved this movie and was very satisfying because I was hoping it would be scary and it definitely was.",Insidious
863,saurabhsiddhant25,A great movie for horror fans..,9,17 August 2014,"'OMG!! The devil-monster entered Josh's (Patrick Wilson's) body. What's going to happen next?' is the first thing to come in my mind after watching this movie. Believe me this movie is so indulging that you can't stop yourself getting that thought. It's equally terrifying right form the beginning. Yes, I have never seen such a spine chilling opening sequence ever in any movie. The way it is presented: the color tone, sound effects etc. really signal that something terrifying is about to come. Music composer Joseph Bishara and cinematographer John Leonetti have done an excellent job in this regard. Unlike other films in this genre, it is very well written and deftly handled. And for a horror admirer like me, this movie satisfied my thirst after a long time. I have seen a lot of horror movies and consistently look for some really terrifying horror stuffs, and finally I got this one. It forced me to cover my eyes with hands several times. Though some of its out of the world concepts like ""astral traveler"" and ""the further"" will bother you like ""what is all this crap?"", but once you accept them you are really going to enjoy it. Also there are certain moments in the movie that draw disbelief, like one can really question ""how can the lady send anyone into the further?"" or ""how can voice from the present world reach the further?"", but stuffs like these are unavoidable in any horror movie. Even the best ones have them. You will also find some weird stuff like the demon lives in a house, works in a 2 storey office outfitted with antiques, and listens to music. But who knows? Maybe this is the way they live. Overall, Insidious is certainly good, but it can entertain you only if you are ready to live in the alternate reality offered by it.",Insidious
864,alwayskim28,Underrated horror film,9,18 May 2013,"This film really surprised me back in 2010. Even the opening title of the movie with its sheer, violin sound effect gave me the impression that I was in for a good horror film. The only problem I have with this film is its catchphrase of ""It's not the house that's haunted, It's your son."" Insidious is so much more than what that phrase offers.I attended the film with a date and we both left the theater with chills and a slight uneasy feeling from what we saw. And what's best about it is that there's no gore, no foolish teenagers running away from the ""bad guy"", and very little fake scares. When a chilling moment in the film happens, it happens in full force. I refuse to give spoilers, but just trust the fact that this film was made with $1.5 million dollars, and made $100 million in the box office. It's a genuine horror film with an unfortunate catchphrase. That's what Insidious is.",Insidious

If this movie scared anyone they are probably 9 years old. This isn't horror. Paranormal activity spawned all these ghastly ghostly movies so therefor I blame that franchise for this type of flick.

866,shasha_9999,Disappointing- Not scary at all!,2,19 June 2015,"If i'm going to be perfectly honest, I found this film absolutely terrible. I'm not quite sure why everyone else seems to have absolutely loved it, even finding it scary enough to put in their top 5. Let me start by saying I'm a total horror movie newbie. The only horror films I've seen before this were the Woman in Black and the Cabin in the Woods. I scare very, very easily. And I did not scream a single time during this film.The characters were bland and flat. The parents, Josh and Renai, had no chemistry. The best actors in the film were the children, who sadly, played very minor roles (despite the fact that they portrayed Dalton as the main character?). No offence to Patrick Wilson (this is the first film I've seen him in), but is he capable of forming a facial expression other than mildly worried? By watching this film, you'd never know. The dialogue was also extremely stilted, and felt completely unrealistic. What totally made me mad was that horror is supposed to be the genre the most capable of following the rule ""show, not tell"", and half the movie was a pseudo-monologue detailing every character's life story and persona struggles. Seriously. Did they even try? The budget for this film was supposed to be around $1,500,000, but the villains looked cartoon-like and exaggerated in a way that made me laugh more than it scared me. Honestly, completely disappointing.The film was a bad mixture of Grey's Anatomy (in terms of dramatic), Beetlejuice, and Hocus Pocus – which, I love independently but should never ever be mixed together.The trailer scared me more than the actual film. Which, congrats, I guess.",Insidious
867,staylor2278,Excellent scary movie,10,13 August 2013,I am a lover of horror and great ghost stories. Insidious really was a good movie. I was scared to death from start to finish. I experienced several different types of emotions while viewing this film but in the end it was fear that took me over. This film takes you to a really dark and scary place and from the music to the strange world you will be curled up in your seat for the whole entire ride. I highly recommend this film it is haunting and terrifying and you will be sleeping with the lights on. I cannot wait to see the sequel because I did not want this one to end the way that it ended nor did I expect it to end that way. When I ask people if they have seen this film they always say no and I always tell them you have no idea what you are missing. See this one before you see the second one.,Insidious

I don't know how it managed to take a place under the IMDb's top ten horror movies list which Includes scariest movies like The grudge.The ending could be better but it seems that making second part of any movie has become a trend and that's why in this movie also John become the monster, I means its completely ridiculous.Anyway I am giving it 4 out of 10, 3 for movie and 1 additional point giving respect to the top 10 horror list of IMDb.",Insidious

I like most sub-genres, even the slow burners like The Exorcist and The Shining.I don't like criticizing films for the sake of it, but I could find not a single redeeming quality in this movie to even acknowledge. It's simply bad: There is a distinct lack of ambiance complemented by abysmal acting and a laughably terrible script. You'd think that somehow the film would compensate for this by being intentionally campy, or having a sense of humor, but it doesn't; it's just a forgettable sequence of events before the finale that spoon feeds you the missing plot.The characters are entirely forgettable and lacking any semblance of personality, which could be forgiven if they were the canvas of an amazing mythos, or served to somehow advance the story, but even in that regard the movie fails entirely.I cannot understand why people like this movie at all.

So we get the popcorn ready and everything and put the movie on only to be scared out of our minds within the first 30 min.This movie has everything you want in a scary movie. The music is suspenseful and not overly tacky like most crappy horror movies. The acting is alright however, the plot really messed with me. I really enjoyed that the demon thing attacks no matter what time it is or what house, the whole ""only when its dark"" or ""only in the basement"" idea about horror movies really bothers me. I also enjoyed that the demon really didn't give a crap who or what was trying to mess with it. It wants the kid, it gets the kid. The movie kind of reminded me about of the new evil dead movie where when $hit starts hitting the fan, it just goes and goes until the movie ends.Lastly, I loved that there is a sequel and that it didn't end happy.

For me, the similarities were uncanny! I felt like this could've been the sequel! If you haven't seen ""The Entity"", I DEFINITELY recommend it. It was supposedly based on a true story & was one of my favorites that year. Very dark & twisted, with awesome special effects for '82. I thought this one was a great ""scary"" movie.

875,Jeff-Spicoli,Great horror flick,9,8 March 2011,"I saw the screening in NYC last week as well, and I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. The lack of gore and elimination of ""fake scares"" adds to the boding sense of doom. I think that the masses are going to like this movie, it's well done. The haunting concept here is different and it's refreshing. I was scared during the movie and some of the scenes still give me the shivers. It's easier in many ways (for me at least) to dismiss over the top gore versus the buildup of increasingly scary concepts in this film. Lin Shaye is fantastic and very effective in her role. I thought that Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne were excellent as well. As pointed out above, the script does not explain every aspect of why the characters do what they do (e.g. why does Patrick's character start working late and stay away from home?) but it seemed obvious enough to me. The only thing that confused me was the introduction (or lack thereof) of Patrick's character's mother, Barbara Hershey. It becomes clearer later in the movie that she is Patrick's mother so this is a minor nitpick in my mind.Congrats on a refreshing take of a classic horror theme.",Insidious

878,janetleigh1984,Great Movie!!,9,29 May 2015,"I love horror movies and I must say that this movie was a great horror movie. The story line, the cast, and everything about this movie was great. It is a must watch. This movie keeps you on the edge of your seat. This is a movie that you could watch over and over. I wouldn't watch it alone if you are the type to be scared easily. I would not recommend for small children of course. This movie leaves you wanting to watch part two and three. The acting in the movie is great. The effects and etc are also great. There isn't one thing bad that I could say about this movie. Great horror film. This movie was well put together.",Insidious
879,ryanisreadingfc,"predictable, not scary, if anything hilarious",1,29 December 2014,"People talked about this film like it was the scariest movie ever made. The truth is actually the opposite. It Is a typical modern horror. A demon in the house, someone is possessed, they seek help from some exorcist blah blah blah... The jump scares were predictable and if anything they were funny. The characters were one dimensional and boring. The special effects and makeup were cheesy and ridiculous. Very disappointing for the people who made saw. In conclusion I think if you have never watched a horror movie before and are below the age of 9, then this film will give you nightmares. If not, expect to yawn a lot. If you want to watch unoriginal jump scare ghost movies then I would suggest watch sinister or conjuring. This will disappoint you.",Insidious
880,indiflick_chick,Extremely flawed in my opinion but I'd watch it again,10,2 April 2011,"the first half of the film was really scary, full of tension, creepy images and jump out of your seat moments. Second half totally lacked the subtlety that created these terrifying moments in the first half.. it got goofy. Which leads me back to my original point of view for most horror films: when you leave more to the audience's imagination, they tend to create much scarier things than a makeup team can.In order for a horror film to scare me its almost like they have to create a form of inception, let me explain: by leaving clues of frightening images and sounds your letting the audience's imagination run wild and you are ultimately planting an idea of something bigger and scarier that has stay power to haunt them right before they go to bed. To me, the power of suggestion is much more affective in horror than an aggressive CGI created face telling you to be scared. It doesn't work and didn't work, not for this movie.I can only imagine the last half of the movie being scary to a child, because as a grown up, people with scary make-up on just look like people with scary make-up on, not monsters.All in all, great actors, great idea for a film, some scary points, some laughs, its worth a red-box rent. I give it 6.5/10",Insidious
881,ddevastation,just like the rest,4,20 April 2015,"After hearing what people had to say about this movie I was interested in seeing how great this movie was. After seeing it I wanted to regain the hour and whatever minutes I spent watching it. Not a single jump scare was scary because they were all predictable. I've noticed watching this one and only staying to watch the first 20 minutes of the 2nd one they are familiar to the conjuring and Annabelle with overly done sentimental endings. Usually great demonic movies the exorcism or the rite, main characters die and you see how the demon is affecting the persons voice skin personality not random occurrences of a demon out of the blue. In the end only voicing opinion, but all in all if you want to be scared, this is not the movie you want to watch",Insidious
882,harrismoat,I really enjoyed it,7,16 October 2015,"Insidious is an amazing film that doesn't follow other films in its genre. firstly i love the fact that this film just seemed to forget all other horror movie clichés,and how most of the jump- scares just come out of no where. There aren't many massive build ups to them either. Secondly the music in this film is beautiful you can't hear it unless you want to and it raises the tension by a lot. However in my opinion I would say that the acting sent very good and Renai reminded me of Wendy Torrence from the shinning in the way that if she isn't crying she just seems to be yelling or holding someones face to conclude i adore this film and James wan is one of my favourite directors but he just needs a new cast new manager.",Insidious
883,lasersailor-75236,Really likes the movie because of how scary it was,10,1 November 2015,"This is one of the scariest PG-13 movies I have ever seen! I was constantly scaring my girlfriend by grabbing her shoulders at the scariest parts and shaking her. That was fun:) But I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to be super scared and also doesn't want to sleep for a few nights! I couldn't sleep for at least a night without waking up almost screaming of terror. I watched this on Halloween because we wanted to watch a somewhat old movie. It was projected on a sheet hanging from a tree and we were all scared to be outside with anybody except our group of about 10 people. That's how scary it was. Anyway, Best movie I have seen in a few months. You should watch it now!",Insidious
884,maltheman,Really interesting and scary.,10,1 December 2018,"It's been quite a while since I've seen a movie this scary, it doesn't solely use jumps area but also horrendous and blizzard looking visuals which made me scream a few times.
The plot was good and easy to follow, but aso wasn't too predictable in my opinion.
A great movie and a classic in my book",Insidious

886,jonascash,6.8?,5,11 September 2016,"At the first, I was a little bored. Everything was convenient and predictable but that's normal after you watch several horror/paranormal movies. The story was great! Okay, it can be a rip off but we didn't saw that side of what lays beyond (they could take this place much more interesting..) Some fewer points: The things that supposed to be scary weren't ""the man with flames on his face"" seemed to be from a '50's horror store Everything was predictable which was a bit of a bumSome good points: Great story Good cliffhanger Good actingFor the story of the movie, the 6.8 rating is accurate! For the ""lack"" of scary, I would give this a 4 So I think a nice 5 rating is good enough. I watched several movies which had more worse ratings and was much more scary.",Insidious
887,tessawhite,Why do people find this scary?,6,30 October 2016,"Insidious it is not a bad movie, but I don't see how it is super scary. There are a lot of jumpscares and i have seen it before, it reminds me of poltergeist. I had to skip some parts in the film because it was dragging for too long. It isn't the scariest movie ever, it has a good story, good acting, good cinematography, but too many jumpscares and I'm tired of it. I love James Wan but in my opinion this film is just not that scary. The red face demon is kinda creepy i got to admit. And i look at the song ""tip toe through the tulips"" differently. But this film doesn't really make me scared when you mention the name and I don't think i could watch this movie for the second time. Its like a ""watched it once but don't think i will again"" kind of movie.",Insidious
888,rdeleon115,"A scary, refreshing horror film",8,29 March 2011,"The experience of watching ""Insidious"" is a great one. Director James Wan and writer Leigh Whannell have put together a fun ride for horror fans and those who like to be scared. Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne are very solid as the two leads and the supporting actors (including Whannell himself) do a fine job as well, amplifying the drama and providing welcome bits of humor. The only downside to the film is that a few aspects of the third act should have been toned down a bit and left to the imagination. Overall though, ""Insidious"" is a great, creepy film. It's refreshing to watch a horror film full of genuine scares, practical effects and that has an ending that's just downright chilling. It should be very interesting to see what Wan and Whannell do next.",Insidious
889,thestuprestonexperience,Laughable,1,3 January 2019,Possibly the worst horror film I've ever wasted nearly 2 hours on. I don't know what planet all the high reviews are on but I think they need to get out more!,Insidious
890,dosealas,long live the Marlboro man,7,26 June 2011,"Just saw the movie, as not being a horror fan, I liked it. good cinematography, good sound and music, acting was great. it is a well made film in my point of view. I was especially surprised to see astral projection being plotted in the movie, something you cant see much in (horror) films. thumbs up for that. is it scary? depends. is it worth it? I would recommend it.well whats my problem then? well I bet everyone my generation knows about the Marlboro man.. he is cool, he is the raw model male Homo sapiens, he has lead many people to smoke to be as cool, he also died of cancer, as many have died following his path. this is the Marlboro man of the scary astral projection realm, don't go there! you will get your body snatched, everywhere is dark and you need a light to see, until you bump into an alien-emotionalized ghostly face. the way i see it its a ""alien fax machines invade the planet"" movie, but i know my fax machine, many don't know astral travel. I hoped at least they could have included some reality or info on the subject. at least people have now heard the subject and will show enthusiasm to astral projection (if they haven't already shitted them selves) :)",Insidious
891,sutherland-16240,Complete Waste of Time,1,22 September 2019,"Slow, predictable, with terrible dialogue and mediocre effects. It stole elements from so many other movies and executed them poorly!

892,SalmanKhan110,Must Watch no doubt,10,26 June 2011,"This is easily one of the best horror movies I've seen in awhile. I had family over and what the heck popped in the Bluray, and I did see many of the scenes coming but everything from the horror sound effects to everything else the movie is amazing. I have never been this scared after watching a movie, I'm 19 now and I like to think I've grown up from getting scared but this movie really did it. I was told about this movie awhile ago but I didn't want to watch it on DVD, My mission was to wait for the bluray, as such hype for a movie can only do justice on Bluray. I'm definitely going to give it another watch in a few days, I've already recommended the movie to a few on my friends as one of the best horror flicks in awhile.",Insidious
893,watchit_84,I want my money back!!!,1,10 May 2011,"How people are claiming this is the scariest film in decades is beyond me.I went to watch this, thinking it was going to be cheesy. I'd seen the trailer but I thought I'd give it a chance.I was rather surprised for the first 20-30 minutes, and thought it was going to prove me wrong. Yes, the story had been recycled but it still could have been a good concept if done right.Then the cheese and my giggles came pouring out. I was sitting there thinking WTH??? This can't be serious. 'Heavy face paint' is meant to scare me? I've seen better at Haloween!!! And as for the ghosts..... well, they made me cry...... with laughter!!! I can't believe I wasted my time and money. The thing that annoys me the most, is that it could have been a slightly different, more modern version of Poltergeist. At least that would have made it acceptable.But no, another huge waste of time. I would not suggest it for any TRUE horror film fans.",Insidious
894,lyricwizard,the funniest movie i have ever seen !!! #laugh out loud,3,25 August 2017,"this movie is just hilarious. just look at that red faced guy, he looks like a donkey. they just stuffed 100+ ghosts in one story. if lorraine knew that the astral traits had been passed on to dalton by his father , couldn't she have told his mother and father that he is not sleeping, was she busy eating dorritos and watching spongebob all the time. and what was that leather coat guy doing ? licking daltons mothers face ?. they are ghosts not zombies that you can kill with a headshot. this movie just made me fall to the ground. my opinion is that don't watch this movie. literally you'll fall to the ground .",Insidious

897,tchoocogordinho,uuuuuuu,9,30 October 2018,"The first good surprise of 2011 in the movies emerges, and it left the man behind the first mortal games, James Wan. The Director works with mastery of the clichés of haunted house films and creates a truly frightening work, something that has not been seen in contemporary cinema for a long time. Anyone who sees only the trailer or the Insidious synopsis has no idea how much the film evolves.
At one point, the film has a touch of poltergeist, of Tobe Hooper and Steven Spielberg, but takes its own original course. Wan takes control of the situation and timing of the moments of fright, which take the audience by surprise countless times. Insidious is sure of chills and disturbance during its duration. As for demonic elements of the film, impressive as James Wan balances the subtle and exaggerated with skill.",Insidious
898,pabetra,I REALLY RECOMEND IT!!!!,6,14 December 2018,"This film is really entertaining. There are more scares than fears ,you have to look closely at the details because there always anticipate what is going to happen.The only bad thing is that is a long film but at least there are always things happening around.In resume I recommend it if you want to have a moment of tension.",Insidious

901,danny2135,It was scary but then it was not!,2,8 June 2013,"I mean, the whole ghosts were very poorly done. Was it lack of budget? The special effects dudes weren't top notch? I don't know but they looked really stupid: like a small town fair horror house. On the other hand, the demon, well, it was stupid too. He really looked badly done with badly makeup. In fact, you could even tell a little bit, the actor portraying him or that it was all makeup. Bad, bad, bad!But this movie scared me because of something, horror movie lack this days. The sound editing was great, superb, really annoying and scary. The sound was great, but everything else, the characters, the plot, the special effects and the funny ""ghostbusters"" dudes was bad, bad, bad!I rate this movie 2/10.",Insidious
