0,Leofwine_draca,Not bad at all,6,4 July 2021,"I enjoyed this film, for what it's worth. It's no classic and hardly original, pasting together bits and pieces from genuine prior hits like ALIENS, BATTLE: LOS ANGELES and STARSHIP TROOPERS in particular, but it works. After a slightly strained set-up with cheesy acting from Chris Pratt, we get thrown into a story offering copious action and even a bit of time travel a la EDGE OF TOMORROW to boot. I'm no fan of Pratt but the supporting cast is pretty good here, and the CGI effects are generally decent for once. The film suffers a little from the family friendly rating but pushes hard at the boundaries, with a high body count and plenty of carnage as the humans battle aliens for supremacy. On the downside, it's highly predictable, the emoting is overdone and it's about half an hour too long, but other than that it's not bad at all.",The Tomorrow War
1,SnoopyStyle,creature feature,6,7 July 2021,"Dan Forester (Chris Pratt) is a high school science teacher and family man with daddy issues and a desperation to succeed. It's 2022 and people from the future suddenly show up. They tell us that humankind is on the brink of extinction from an alien invasion 30 years in the future. All the world's present-day militaries are sent but they fail to turn the tide of the war. A worldwide conscription is instituted to send more people into the future fight.I would have more questions about the aliens than these people seem to have. The movie tries to explain it away with a very weak excuse. It's more likely that it wants to save the reveal for the drama. It doesn't want to show the sharks right away. Aside from a few problems in the world building, the movie also struggles with the daddy issue premise. I get the need to fill out the Dan Forester character but it's all rather ham-fisted. The first act can be cut down. The middle part in the future is basically a creature war battle film. My main issue with the creatures is that they aren't technologically advanced. So the obvious question is who brought these 'aliens'. Quite frankly, I thought it was more probable that these creatures came from a Russian lab. At the end of the day, this is a mindless creature feature and it's nothing more than popcorn fun.Finally, there is an unnecessary fourth act to this movie. It should have ended with the return to the present. If it wants to continue, the story can do so in a sequel. The climax had already happened. The movie needs to end and it's too long anyways. I don't know anything about this writer but he mashed a few standardized stories together. He can cut out the daddy issue and the extra act. It would make this a smaller creature feature which may be too small for a big star like Chris Pratt. This wants to be World War Z and Chris Pratt to be Brad Pitt. Instead, it's a Frankenstein movie of spare parts.",The Tomorrow War
2,nogodnomasters,You are our last hope,8,20 July 2021,"This is another man vs. Aliens to save the planet. The fighting resembles that of ""Star Ship Troopers"" although the film dialogue isn't quite as light. In 2050 or so aliens have wiped out much of the human race. Reinforcements are taken from the elder population, i.e. Those that are dead by 2050. There is a time worm hole that gives people 168 hours in the future to fight. Their survival rate is low. Dan Forester (Chris Pine) becomes the main character as we focus on his family drama and what he must do to save the world and his daughter.It was mindless enjoyable. J. K. Simmons and Sam Richardson were good on screen.Guide: No swearing, sex, or nudity.",The Tomorrow War
3,kosmasp,Way into the future ... of whom again?,8,5 July 2021,"Have to admit, when I first saw the poster I thought this was the long awaited sequel to the Tom Cruise starring (and Emily Blunt, don't worry I haven't forgotten about her) Edge of Tomorrow ... as it turns out this has nothing to do with that. Apart from a man and a woman appearing quite big on both movies main posters. And being Science Fiction to a degree.Maybe even have the same amount of (non)sense to them as well ... one thing is for sure, you should not even try to think too much about what the movie is implying or if it would work (within the boundaries of the movies logic, forget about real logic and science) ... All I can say is, shut your brain off and enjoy this as popcorn entertainment, nothing more and nothing less.With the stellar cast it provides it really is more than worthwhile ... talking about (Inter)stellar: one might see a connection between those movies, father going on a trip from which he may not come back ... and some other things I reckon - this being way more action packed of course. And with the addition of JK Simmons ... well let's say the guy knows how to make fun and tease others ... also has the best line towards the end of the movie ... why didn't you earlier indeed ... you'll know once you see it.So if you are able to shut your brain off and just go for the ride ... well there's nothing that will stop you having fun.",The Tomorrow War
4,classicsoncall,"""We are food, and they are hungry.""",8,2 July 2021,"It's rare that I would get to see a movie on the day of it's release, in fact, I can't think of any other one I could say that about. But I knew this one was coming and had the opportunity, so took advantage of catching it this morning on Amazon Prime. It's not a bad sci-fi flick with some time travel thrown in which often gets complicated with possible repercussions but this one plays it fairly straightforward. The opening throws you immediately into the action that takes place thirty years in the future before it flashes back to present day to affect the setup. The back story and appearance of the 'whitespike' monsters borrow somewhat from the 'Aliens' franchise, realizing that it's almost impossible to come up with something entirely new and different by now, other than to max out the ugly factor which this film does pretty well. The monsters aren't invincible, though they've taken their toll on humanity over the decades, so now, soldiers from the future require the presence of Earth's last few capable citizens from the present day to rotate into the future to do battle. I liked Chris Pratt in this one, he's got the action hero persona down pat, though I wonder if saving the Earth from a future holocaust is a step down from guarding the entire galaxy. The film also explores the idea of second chances with Dan Forester's (Pratt) Dad (J. K. Simmons), and by saving the Earth's future timeline, the relationship with his family. Of the supporting players, no one really stood out for me other than Forester's future daughter, portrayed by Yvonne Strahovski. Special effects and alien battle action take over much of the screen time, and if that's your thing, you'll probably like this as much as I did.",The Tomorrow War
5,paul_haakonsen,Good old fashioned fast-paced man vs alien fun...,7,27 July 2021,"Now, as I sat down to watch the 2021 action sci-fi movie ""The Tomorrow War"", I was told not to expect too much from the movie, and that it was a watchable but shallow movie experience.Needless to say that I watched the movie anyway, as it was a movie that I hadn't already seen. Actually I hadn't even seen the trailer for the movie, so I virtually knew nothing about the movie or what it was about, aside from it having Chris Pratt on the cast list.And I must say, now that I have seen it, that writer
Zach Dean and director Chris McKay actually managed to churn out something that was very enjoyable and entertaining for me. And it was the type of movie that fell right into my preference of movies.The storyline told in ""The Tomorrow War"" has an interesting concept idea. Sure, this is not rocket science, nor something that requires a whole lot of thinking on the audience part, but it is the type of movie where you lean back well into the chair, munch on the popcorn and enjoy the action and fighting on the screen. So essentially, this is some good old fun.Actually, while the storyline is sort of simplistic, I must admit that I actually found it to be entertaining enough. There are some good aspects to the storyline and it definitely makes for adequate entertaining.As for the acting in the movie, well I was entertained. And I will say that they definitely had a good ensemble of actors and actresses on the cast list. Chris Pratt was nicely cast for the lead role and it was nice to see him in a movie such as this. And I was thrilled to see J. K. Simmons in the movie, just a shame he wasn't given more screen time, because he had a great character in the movie and he was just bringing the character to life so marvelously. Edwin Hodge and Jasmine Mathew were also very nicely cast for this movie.""The Tomorrow War"" is packed with amazing visuals, and that really brought the movie to life so well on the screen. And yeah, I must admit that I was really enjoying what I saw on the screen, because the CGI team behind this movie were just spectacular. So when you sit down to watch ""The Tomorrow War"" you will be in for some amazing special effects. And needless to say that the creature design was also something I really enjoyed.As a movie viewer not overly keen on sci-fi movies, I will say that ""The Tomorrow War"" is one of those action sci-fi movies that proves to be incredibly enjoyable, much akin to movies such as ""Starship Troopers"" or ""District 9"".I went in with little expectations from what I was told, but I went out with a sense of properly being entertained for more than two hours.My rating of ""The Tomorrow War"" lands on a seven out of ten stars.",The Tomorrow War
6,neil-476,"Fun, if derivative",8,3 July 2021,"Family man Dan is having job trouble. But that stops mattering when soldiers from the future arrive to recruit help to fight an alien invasion.Amazon Prime present this 140 minute action packed scifi movie which combines aliens (very fast, lots of legs and teeth, see also A Quiet Place 1 and 2), time travel, a great deal of ordnance, two or three decent plot wrinkles, and Chris Pratt's hunky everyman likeability.The film goes quickly despite its length because there is always something happening. The bad language and violence mean that it's not a family film, and it's not massively original - you'll spot bits from various other places in it. But the effects are first rate, the cast are all good, and it never forgets to be fun.",The Tomorrow War
7,ferguson-6,falls short,5,2 July 2021,"Greetings again from the darkness. There are some great time-travel movies, some great Science-Fiction movies, and some great alien-invasion action movies; however, there are very few that successfully blend all of the above. Director Chris McKay (THE LEGO BATMAN MOVIE, 2017) and writer Zach Dean (DEADFALL, 2012) come up short in this attempt, and in fact, much of the movie is borderline ridiculous in story line, dialogue, and special effects. It's extremely rare for me to go two hours (or 2:20 for this one) and never engage with a character or story.We open on Chris Pratt (and many others) falling from the sky and landing in a horrific war zone. Immediately we flashback 3 decades. Pratt plays Dan Forester, a high school science teacher and former Special Forces soldier in Iraq. He has a supportive wife Emmy (Betty Gilpin, THE HUNT, 2020) and a whip-smart young daughter Muri (Ryan Kiera Armstrong, ""Anne with an E""). A glitch in the matrix occurs during the World Cup and a platoon of soldiers announce they are from the future and need help fighting aliens that are annihilating the human race.Soon, a global military draft is put in place. Thanks to a ""worm hole"", those drafted can serve 7 days by bouncing from 2022 to 2051 and back ... well at least the 30% who survive get to come back. When Dan is drafted, he hopes to save the world for his little girl, and told her and his students that ""science is how you resolve problems"". Of course, big guns help too ... but not as much as you'd hope since these aliens are fast, strong, and terribly ugly to look at (with a bit of a throwback look to the 70's).In 2051, Dan reports to Romeo Command played by Yvonne Strahovski (""Dexter""), and he works closely with fellow draftees played by Sam Richardson (""Veep""), Edwin Hodge (THE PURGE franchise), and Mary Lynn Rajskub (""24 Hours""). Romeo Command also happens to be a brilliant scientist concocting a potion to destroy the aliens. The hope is to take it back 30 years and prevent the alien invasion from ever occurring. It's a wing and a prayer plan and there's a bit more to the story that won't be revealed here.Pratt is no stranger to action movies (GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY, JURASSIC WORLD), and he's at his best when cracking wise with one-liners. Unfortunately many of those fall flat when there are only 500,000 humans remaining on the planet, and the human race appears doomed. A crazy (and not believable) turn of events leads us to a segment that includes riding snow mobiles on a Russian glacier. The filmmakers try overly hard to work in serious topics like climate change, government incompetence, and anti-war demonstrations (why sacrifice for a war that's not yet happening?). On top of that, daddy issues abound with multiple characters, which is where a buff JK Simmons (Oscar winner for WHIPLASH, 2014) comes in.If the film had received its originally planned theatrical run, there likely would have been a few refund requests. However, streaming on Amazon is a much better fit for lower expectations.Available on Amazon Prime beginning July 2, 2021.",The Tomorrow War
8,bombersflyup,Outstanding!,10,3 July 2021,"The Tomorrow War isn't perfect, has entertainment in abundance though and I loved it.The premise isn't overly creative, but has a clever plot and the action sequences off the charts thrilling. It's well acted, Pratt a solid lead, though only child actor Armstrong a standout as Muri. I see a lot of films and rarely give this rating, best film of the year thus far. A missed comical opportunity at the end with the volcano kid, should be in a cushy chair eating Maccas in class or something. :)",The Tomorrow War
9,deloudelouvain,Don't pay too much attention to negative reviews if you like entertaining sci-fi movies.,8,9 July 2021,"After reading a lot of negative reviews I still gave this movie a shot because by experience I know I hardly every agree with these reviews when it's about a movie in this genre, that is science fiction/action. And I'm glad I didn't pay too much attention to those reviews from people that are very hard to please or that just are eternally unsatisfied. The Tomorrow War is exactly what I expected, a lot of non-stop action (yes there's a lot of shooting), a story that looks far fetched (but then again it's a science fiction so what do you expect?), and a large amount of CGI's. Sounds boring to some but certainly not to me (neither to my wife), certainly not when it's well done like in this movie. The monsters/aliens are great, the computer generated images here are just excellent. The story is very entertaining, and even though the duration of the movie is quite long you never get bored for a second. As for the acting I've never been a big fan of Pratt but credit to him, he did a decent job. As for Yvonne Strahovski, which did a terrific job in The Handmaid's Tale, where she plays a character you can't help hating, she this time plays a totally different character and it was good again. So in short, The Tomorrow War is a perfect movie if you like sci-fi, good CGI's, and need to relax for a couple of hours with a bucket of popcorn and mindless action.",The Tomorrow War
10,siderite,"Really stupid, boring and offensively derivative",4,5 July 2021,"If you get the idea for your movie from somewhere else and then you do a great film, you are an artist. What are you after you get the idea for your movie from at least three different beloved stories and still do a ridiculously bad film?That's the story of this piece of garbage which manages to mix around the ideas of Alien Earth War, The Thing and something like The Forever War or Old Man's War, gets Chris Pratt and J. K. Simmons in the cast and then takes all of that goodness and somehow manages to drive it into the ground via a latrine. The incompetence of the writer's staff for this film is astounding. Nothing makes sense in this film, I mean literally nothing.Bottom line: ignore this completely. The only worse film this year is Army of the Dead.",The Tomorrow War
11,DKosty123,Updated 1950's Sci-Fi Action Thriller -Tung In Cheek Message For Today,6,20 July 2021,"This movie reminds me much plot wise of some of the strangely plotted 1950's Sci-Fi films from that era. The difference is that this one has modern cgi and plenty of action. Once you put your brain away perhaps the movie can be enjoyed. There are plot holes galore, but the action is action.Do they save the planet? Yes, but not until a whole lot of government waste of lives fighting a future war. One big hole is not explaining why a government that has 30 years head start in knowing what is coming can't handle this better without getting lots of people killed? This is a secret message here about how this pandemic situation is still not being handled properly. Not only did the last administration mess up, it appears the current one is in the process of making the same mistake.So an alien ship crashes in Russia and releases alien animals that eat people for their blood and reproduce by the millions and eventually kill all of human kind. The world is portrayed as a huge mess in the present and the future. It's really hard to tell which is worse here.The best thing going for the film besides the action sequences is the fact this is blue collar heroes. (Green Collar Heroes) The main heroes are all veterans getting some respect they deserve being recalled to fight a war in the future because of their past. The classic ""Thank You For Your Service' is even used here.The cast actually elevates this script more than it should be. The plot is not hard to follow except for the departures from reality late in the film. The folks involved in this one are going to get better. We just have to wait until they hit the right material. Currently this movie is streaming on Amazon Prime, a prime original.At a little of 2 hours, this one is entertaining action while in wait for the next Bond Movie which I think is soon. At least they did not really leave a way to sequel this though I suppose if they did that would make even less sense than this one.",The Tomorrow War
12,thesar-2,Edge of Another Tomorrow,5,3 July 2021,"Ahhh, the good ole days when Hollywood remembered to save their biggest popcorn movie of the year for the Fourth of July weekend. This is how it was, how it shall be again in the summer of twenty-one.In a blend of Edge of Tomorrow, Terminator, War of the Worlds, Alien, Starship Troopers, A Quiet Place, John Carpenter's The Thing and Independence Day (1 and, sadly, 2,) comes Chris Pratt & co. Trying to save the world from its DOOOOMED future. (Did I get all the movies this ripped off? Probably some more.)During an important soccer game no one in America would really care about - but they do in the future of 2022, I guess, comes US from the future to tell today's US that we're losing a huge battle with generic aliens. And they need our bodies! I mean, help. Well, both.Unfortunately for Now US, it's 30 years out when the attacks first happen and you know how Today's US is lazy as hell. If anything, no one would act upon this until weeks before the attack and even then, there'd be countless debates on the best way.But, fortunately for 2022's US, Chris Pratt always plays the same character who has to attempt to save the universe no matter what. Even if there are countless and mind-numbingly bad decisions and dozens of missed opportunities along the way.Though, this movie is the main definition of leaving your brain at the door, it's incredibly slow at the beginning and frankly, 30 minutes could've been trimmed down to get to what we all came for: THE TOMORROW WAR.***Final Thoughts: If you're looking for depth, originality or surprises, watch the aforementioned movies in the beginning of my review. Otherwise, it's suitable if you have a lazy Saturday to kill. And have Prime, of course. You wouldn't want to pay too much for this ""experience.""",The Tomorrow War
13,FeastMode,another streaming movie fail,4,13 August 2021,"I don't think this has happened to me before. I watched two thirds of the movie, thought it was a flawed but enjoyable sci-fi flick and was ready to wrap up and give it 6 stars. I felt it was on par with the better streaming movies.Then i realized there was still about 45 minutes left. That alone is a failure. I thought i just watched the climax (and could argue it really was the climax but near the middle of the movie). But even so, if the final act is good, i can't really complain...........this final act is filled with horrendous movie logic and movie-breaking plot holes. One thing in the third act makes everything in the first two acts completely meaningless. Couldn't believe it. And the majority of the stupid moments are during this portion.Why would you do this? You had a whole movie. Can someone edit the movie and remove the whole end part? Call it the ""not stupid cut""i really was having a good time. They succeed in two of the most important aspects. The action is pretty awesome (NO SHAKY CAM!!!). And the creature design is BEASTLY. I'm a sci-fi fiend and an action junky. Even with the flaws, i would have given it a positive review and watched it again. (1 viewing, 8/4/2021)SPOILERSi'm going to list out as many dumb things as i can remember.1) the way they were sending ppl back was pretty dumb. Untrained civilians with no armor. Without giving them any knowledge of the enemy they're fighting.2) chris pratt jumps down to save his falling daughter, which would inevitably lead to his death along with the vial that would save all of humanity. Good thing his time in the future ended during the 3 second span of that fall. And even if he caught her, what was the next step? They're both dead.I might be able to understand if it was a father not wanting his daughter to die alone, but only if he didn't have humanity's last hope in his pocket. Not to mention his daughter's life work. Yeah, it looked cool. But COME ON MAN3) chris pratt: ""i have the vial that will kill all the aliens instantaneously and save humanity, lets get it to mass production""government guy: ""the countries are too busy arguing. Also too much tax dollars.""are...... you....... KIDDING ME?!?!?!?!?!?!? Legit one of the dumbest things i've ever heard in a movie.4) you have the worlds smartest ppl, both in the present and future, working on a way to stop the aliens. But it takes 3 randos to figure out they were already here. Sigh5) volcano kid: ""the ash covered half the globe"" chris pratt: ""can you pin point where they landed"" volcano kid: ""sure, right here""6) MOVIE-BREAKING: they find the alien ship in russia. They kill most of them with bullets and C4. They could have killed all of them this way. Which means the vial of poison made by his daughter in the future is NOT NECESSARY. The entire first two acts which lead to her creating the vial and sending it back are now pointless. All they needed to do was find the alien ship and blow it up7) the snowmobile jump kick was hilarious. The later tackle looked SO FAKE.8) they spoon-feed you the message they're trying to get across. For example, future daughter says ""you left us!"" but later, he really does have to leave her. But they really want to make sure you get it. So they say the words ""leave me"" or ""i can't leave you"" repeatedly. No joke like 6 times.",The Tomorrow War
14,Cineanalyst,"The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms",7,2 July 2021,"A rather convoluted metaphor for climate change or other, general existential threats to the future of humanity other than an alien invasion, but ""The Tomorrow War"" works a lot better than I feared it would. Sure, it looks similar to ""Edge of Tomorrow"" (2014), what with the time traveling to fight insect-like extra-terrestrials and the teamwork of a man and woman to figure out how to defeat the seemingly invincible, science-ing it up along the way. The future drafting the present to fight the war even reminds me a bit of ""Tenet"" (2020), except there the future declared war on the present over global warming, itself already something of a hostility towards future generations. In this one, instead, our children and grandchildren plead for our help, to fix what we're at least partly responsible for causing in the first place. The Sabbath stuff here, and thus Genesis and the creation of the world, fits well within this parable, as does all the fatherly issues (which, by the way, I hear Chris Pratt's real father-in-law is the ""The Terminator"" himself, speaking of such sci-fi features). And, if the allegory weren't apparent enough, it's foreshadowed early on in the classroom scene, with bullet points on climate change, mass extinction and such displayed on the screen behind Pratt, and what other reason would there be for the teenager obsessed with volcanoes.The better monster movies tend to be about something other than their nominally ridiculous creatures. Around the 1950s, they tended to be metaphors for nuclear weapons (e.g. ""Godzilla"" (1954)), or perhaps communism (the usual reading of ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" (1956)), as well as anxiety over space travel. More recently, we've had a bunch of 9/11 allegories masquerading as alien invasions, from superhero flicks such as ""The Avengers"" (2012) and ""Man of Steel"" (2013), to more horrifying spectacles such as ""War of the Worlds"" (2005) and ""Cloverfield"" (2008). And, this has been the case since the first great monster movie, ""King Kong"" (1933), which is about colonialism, race, sex and filmmaking. Ditto the early Universal horror films, for that matter. The most alarming monsters are the ones preying on what we already fear. Besides the destruction of the natural environment to the point that it unearths ""The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms"" (1953) under another guise, there's been nothing like a year and a half of a pandemic to put into perspective the other threat here that society might just break down over the prospect of the end being nigh and thus rendering the Armageddon redundant.Otherwise, it's just a bunch of silly time-travelling action of people fighting CGI aliens. Even if one dismisses any parable, though, that silly action is relatively well done. A likeable-enough cast headed by Pratt helps, but the real, well not unsung, hero here is the score, as composed by Lorne Balfe. This Hans Zimmer disciple seems to really know what he's doing, which is demonstrated with an already impressive résumé including various action movies. It's mostly why the globe-trotting and space-time-continuum-hopping pacing here works, and it even prevents all the sentimental scenes from becoming unbearably mawkish. Unreasonable to ask for much more from a summer blockbuster.",The Tomorrow War

17,851222,A superb popcorn movie for Friday evening,9,5 July 2021,"Greetings from Lithuania.""The Tomorrow War"" (2021) was a wall to wall popcorn entertainment. The premise was a bit ridiculous, but i went with it and i was not disappointed to say the least.This is a superb popcorn flick where you kinda have to leave your disbelieve or logic at the door and just enjoy the ride. This movie reminded me heavily of ""Starship Troopers"", ""Aliens"", ""Edge of Tomorrow"" and even a bit of ""Interstellar"". I liked the story and concept - its the kind of premise you won't get every day and if you like sci-fi action flicks, you will definitely enjoy ""The Tomorrow War"".Overall, ""The Tomorrow War"" was a superbly paced, wonderfully acted by Yvonne Strahovski (a killer performance), with amazingly good special effects and good and entertaining premised for a sci-fi actioner - this is an easy recommendation for a popcorn Friday evening. Haven't seen this cool flick in a wile.",The Tomorrow War
18,The-Sarkologist,A Lot Like Starship Troopers,5,9 July 2021,"There are a number of ways that this film could have turned out, but unfortunately it didn't quite go the way that I wanted it to go. Look, it was a fun film, but that is probably where I would draw the line because in the end it was nothing that I hadn't seen before, and there certainly wasn't much in the way of exciting twists either. In fact, a part of me just felt that this was nothing more than a reimagining of Star Ship troopers.So, the film starts in the modern era, but our simple lives (and the World Cup final) is interrupted when a gate opens, some soldiers come out, and tell us that aliens have invaded the Earth and they need soldiers to help fight them off. Mind you, as they go through basic training it comes out that there is none (basic training that is), and they aren't shown pictures of the aliens either because it might scare them. This made me think that there was something a lot more sinister going on, but honestly there isn't.In it end, it comes down to a couple of scientists trying to capture a Queen alien, and get some serum so that they might use it as a weapon to stop them in the past (though why they didn't just get a couple of specialists to do this is somewhat beyond me - though CinemaSins has absolutely gone to town on this film).Yeah, as I mentioned, it was little more than just a remake of Starship troopers, except that they are on Earth as opposed to flying through space. Also, it isn't set entirely in the future, but I don't want to give too much away. As I said, it wasn't a bad film, but it certainly wasn't particularly great either. It has its charm, but that's about it.",The Tomorrow War
19,UniqueParticle,Plenty of entertainment packed in,9,5 July 2021,Wish it had a theatrical release would've been even better otherwise really enjoyable! Proud of the fact that Chris Pratt is first time executive producer along with starring as the title character. Some of The Tomorrow War is complex but I think that aspect is well done with superb writing for a movie that could've bombed But seems to be doing well and is actually awesome even has cinematic gloriousness! Unexpectedly solid action/Sci-Fi blockbuster of the summer despite any negativity. I don't know what's wrong with this review this movie is super awesome though!,The Tomorrow War
20,paulclaassen,Pure entertainment!,6,5 July 2021,"We just can't get enough of alien invasion movies, can we? They keep making 'em and we keep watching 'em...'The Tomorrow War' is an interesting concept, although not exactly original. It felt like a combination of 'Edge of Tomorrow' and 'Battle: Los Angeles', and even a bit of 'Terminator' as well.So, civilians are being recruited to fight an alien invasion 30 years into the future. They managed to create a link so they can jump from the present to the future, but they are limited to how, when and where they can jump. One such a recruit is former Green Beret, Dan Forester (Chris Pratt). When his group jumps, the system malfunctions and many die or are seriously injured as they land on top of and between buildings. One of the programmers still said they need to check what happened, but they never mention it again during the course of the movie, so what was the point?The surviving few are sent on a rescue mission, but soon find themselves being hunted by aliens. The integration of these CGI creatures with the actors is incredibly realistic. I mean, its fan-bloody-tastic!! The visuals in general are very good, and some scenes were jaw-dropping. They do add emotional depth to the movies as well, but honestly, all I cared about were the aliens and the action.Time travel poses many issues and complications - from both a plot and credibility perspective. What becomes of a person's memories when the course of history is changed and now the moments attributed to those memories no longer exist? Yeah, I know, it doesn't make the least bit of sense. They also created a toxin in the future, which is taken back to the past, so the future doesn't happen... get my point? No matter how carefully they try to explain this, it will never make sense.Ok, but time travel will always have these issues, so lets forget about them for a moment. This film is bloody incredible. It is action-packed, well paced and delivers some stunning action sequences and alien fight scenes. Its just a pity that - with the amount of action during the course of the movie - the film has an anti-climax ending. It should have had a full-on onslaught, which would have been awesome! Nevertheless, this was pure entertainment and I enjoyed it!",The Tomorrow War
21,Thanos_Alfie,Nice movie...,7,26 October 2021,"""The Tomorrow War"" is an Action - Drama movie in which we watch a man being drafted to go to the future in order to fight for the fate of humanity after an alien invasion. He faces something completely different than what he was thinking but he has to do everything he can to survive and come back.I enjoyed this movie because it had a nice, interesting plot and did not follow the steps of other movies like it such as ""Edge of Tomorrow"" of 2014. The interpretation of Chris Pratt who played as Dan Forester was good and he did a good job on it. In addition to this, J. K. Simmons who played as his father James Forester was equally good and Yvonne Strahovski who played as Colonel Muri Forester was simply amazing. The direction which was made by Chris McKay was interesting and he combined very well action with drama and the beautiful visual effects lifted the movie even more. He also presented very well the plot of the movie without making it confusing for the audience and the interpretations of the cast helped on that. Finally, I have to say that ""The Tomorrow War"" is a nice action movie to spend your time with and I believe that if you are a fan of action movies you will simply love it.",The Tomorrow War
22,cruise01,Mindless sci fi blockbuster which is loud and action packed.,10,7 July 2021,"5 out of 5 stars.The Tomorrow War is an awesome science fiction action film about a futuristic soldiers going to present time of 2022 to draft people to joining there military. For a future war which humanity is losing towards aliens. It is only a matter of time before humanity is lost unless they can stop an ever growing alien army.Awesome plot about time travel. Chris Pratt plays a character that gets drafted to joining the army. Once in the future he meets Yvonne Strahovski which they are trying to stop the aliens. They are running out of time before humanity is lost. It may not have logic with plot. The script and direction is aiming for a big summer blockbuster film that is pure entertainment.The cast ensemble is great. Chris Pratt delivers a great performance. About a family guy. Battling in the future and trying to get back to his family. Yvonne Strahovski also did great playing a character that has some connections to his character. J. K. Simmons, and Betty Gilspin all did good with there supporting roles. Sam Richardson playing a character that tries to add some comic relief with his non stop talking. And Edwin Hodge playing a character that has done a few tours in the war and has a strong motive to stay fighting.The film is big, loud, and action packed. Great action sequences when the soldiers come across an alien army that are fast beasts that shoots stuff out of there tentacles. Big action set pieces that feels like it goes over the top. Like how Zack Snyder Army of the Dead movie did. The visual effects were good.If your looking for an action packed sci fi time travel alien war film. This is perfect for you. Its action packed. Big. And it delivers as a summer blockbuster.",The Tomorrow War
23,eddie_baggins,A high profile misfire,2,6 July 2021,"One of Amazon Prime's highest profile original releases yet with a price tag of $200 million in production costs and a premise that would usually suggest a bout into cinema screens around the world, there's been a significant amount of hype and marketing surrounding the lead up to The Tomorrow War being available to stream into lounge-rooms across the globe but sadly this Chris Pratt lead sci-fi action flick is a DOA with a daft premise and lame execution that ensures this bloated mess of a film has zero chance of succeeding.Directed by Chris McKay who is usually seen in the animated film space both in film and TV, War sees star and producer Chris Pratt try and test his mantle as a leading man with a less comedic role than we've seen from the likeable performer who made his mark with an incredible leap from ""that guy"" role in TV show Parks and Recreation to fully fledged Hollywood star in Guardians of the Galaxy and Jurassic World films but showcasing that sometimes your best off sticking to what works, Pratt is lost in a nothing role as everyday family man turned alien fighter extraordinaire Dan Forester as his natural charisma and smarts are pushed aside for a thinly drawn caricature of a main character. Unchanged:To be fair to Pratt, even if he dialled up the charisma to eleven and somehow managed to make Forester an interesting character to bring to life, not much would've saved War from its downright atrocious central concept that sees everyday citizens from ""now"" drafted and sent to the ""future"" where they can fight aliens that are destroying the world with aged weapons and literally zero training instead of the future citizens of this alien infested land just coming back to warn us to prepare for the war and start building the weaponry/training to prepare better for the fight ahead. Unchanged:As is the case with any time travel film you have to leave a large amount of room for forgiveness and grace when it comes to things making sense as at the end of the day its all so far-fetched there's little reason to usually care too much for things being tied up nicely in a logic sense but thanks to its po-faced nature and tiresome delivery, War isn't having fun with its daft idea, rather its trying to be something its not and therefore forces us to have zero fun as an audience also. Unchanged:There's a undoubtedly a fun film somewhere in this over the top and ridiculous set up, its just like McKay, his screenwriter Zach Dean and in turn the films cast that also includes a trying hard Yvonne Strahovski and the wasted Betty Gilpin and bearded/bulked J. K Simmons didn't know how to create that version of the film with none of the films sci-fi spectacles (that recall mid-budget level games), time travelling escapades or alien investigations bringing anything to the table that is overly enjoyable to consume. Unchanged:Sometimes with films of the same DNA as War you'd wished you had the chance to witness proceedings on the big screen but its unlikely anything but a complete re-write and re-purposing of this material would've worked with not even the most awe-inspiring of big screen goodness and bells and whistles likely to have saved this forgettable affair from its early grave. Unchanged:Final Say -A sad misstep for all involved particularly its off-key leading man, The Tomorrow War should've been a fun Edge of Tomorrow like sci-fi romp but its nothing more than an overly long slog that fails to create a singular reason to care or moment to remember. Unchanged:1 rooftop swimming pool out of 5.",The Tomorrow War
24,Tweetienator,A Rather Dull Affair,4,3 July 2021,"I was almost asleep till the action started - the first half hour of introduction is a well made and acted but nonetheless really boring affair (I hear the writer thinking: I must start somewhere...), what we get after that is something we watched a million times before - and it tastes rather soul- and bloodless: dull action scenes and dialogues on auto-pilot - Independence Day-like blabla with a solid work by the effects department. If you compare The Tomorrow War with The Edge of Tomorrow, it shows hard the lack of quality in almost every aspect compared to Tom Cruise's tour de force. I won't recommend The Tomorrow War but if you like to watch movies like Independence Day or Pacific Rim (I don't), The Tomorrow War may work just fine for you.",The Tomorrow War

26,digitalbeachbum,"The time travel paradox is a logic killer, but the final battle was brilliant.",1,2 July 2021,"The idea behind time travel is never understood. I enjoy some of these movies, like Back to the Future. It wasn't valid logically, but it was a lot of fun. The same can be said for this movie also, its not valid logically, but it is a lot of fun at least for a few scenes.I can understand and feel the pain that Chris Pratt portrays. I think he has honed his acting skills and cut his teeth by putting in the long hours. Do you remember him from Jennifer's Body or Moneyball? He has come a long way.J. K. Simmons is awesome as usual. He plays the aging father for Chris Pratt's character.With that being said, the ending is the creme de la creme of this movie. It is literally one of the best endings I've seen in a long time. It is a fantastic final battle for an ending of a movie. I enjoyed that humans were having trouble with the alien and that it was extremely difficult to kill, but being humans they didn't give up and they were able to defeat it. The way Chris Pratt delivered the final blow, and then shouting ""DIE! DIE!"" with out having to yell some profanity was a miracle.I don't believe adding Sam Richardson to the ending was a good idea. He had nothing to do with the final battle. I found it more of ""let's add the token black guy to make it political correct"". Why not add him to the fight? It would have been that more intense to see three humans fighting the beast and losing a tough fight.The time travel portion is illogical and it kills the movie. It would have been far better to just have the aliens with out the future humans having to time travel back to bring humans forward. It creates a paradox and that is why you NEVER use time travel in your stories.****
Sorry to spoil the movie's logic for anyone, but at the end all these humans return to their lives and think that everything is okay? Well guess what? Your future is about to SUCK the big one, because going in to the future to help future humans doesn't change the fact that these aliens are going to show up and you people are going to get the brunt of the attack. So why didn't you just stay behind and start to prepare? And why didn't these future humans come back to fight the aliens in the past?By coming back in time, they create a different timeline also. So their future is still screwed, but they could help these humans prepare for the attack and they could give them the toxin to stop any future wars with these aliens. But, nope, they don't help them. They could have brought a body back so that humans in the past could have developed better weapons or the toxin
****There are other problems with the movie, but it would take too much time to point them out. I'll just end saying that it was a ""Meh"" movie which had a over the top ending.",The Tomorrow War

It's not terribly complex or even that bright, but it's pretty fun, with big, crisp action set-pieces, goofy time travel twists, and some creepy-enough (though familiar) monster designs. And hey! It's an original thing!",The Tomorrow War
28,southdavid,Miami Heat,6,9 July 2021,"Another massively hyped film arriving on a streaming service, ""The Tomorrow War"" was, as many of them are, pretty underwhelming. However, as I'd seen some reviews lambasting the film before I saw it, the fact that it was just a bit derivative and miscast meant the film was actually better than I was anticipating.Soldiers appear from the future and tell the stunned population that the Earth is engaged in a war against an Alien race and that they are losing. With a method in place to transport people between the two decades, the Governments begin a draft system to send people to help with the fight back. One such man is former Green Beret, Dan Forester (Chris Pratt) who leaves his wife and daughter for one week's active tour. In the future he discovers that his now grown up daughter, Muri (Yvonne Strahovski) is the head of the Earths scientific defence force and that she has a final mission in mind, one in which Dan is a key part.I do feel that one of the films problems is casting Chris Pratt. Whilst I do generally like him, he's not exactly playing another lovable idiot here but his presence does mean that there are some comedic moments that the film goes for, that it doesn't need from him. It's hard not to see them as a being a script punch up, once he was cast, that they wouldn't have looked for ... say Henry Cavill, for example, to do. There are reliable comedic relief efforts elsewhere from JK Simmons and particularly from Sam Richardson.Away from that though, I felt the film was fine, just nothing that we haven't seen before. The time travel rules are a bit arbitrary, when it comes to closer examination, but they do make sense. Jumps are limited to the two points, both of which are 30 years apart but travelling forward in time, so there's no ability to ""replay"" and rewrite a part of the war. It's also an ""Endgame"" style branching narrative, so changing the past can't change the future only create a new one. It mostly holds together until starting to stretch the credulity towards the end.The aliens themselves were interesting and nicely done as were all of the visual effects. There were some decent action moments, but nothing to really push the genre forward.As I said, thinking that I was going to see an absolute disaster and then it turning out to be reasonably watchable was a pleasant surprise, but I wouldn't go out of my way to recommend it to people.",The Tomorrow War
29,paul-allaer,OK action scenes but disastrous cringe-worthy dialogues sink the movie,4,2 July 2021,"As ""The Tomorrow War"" (2021 release; 138 min.) opens, a bunch of soldiers fall out of the sky, landing into an all-out war zone. We then go to ""28 Years Earlier, December 2022"", and we get to know Dan Forester, who has served in two combat tours in Iraq years ago. As Dan and his family and friends are watching a soccer game in Brazil on TV, all of the sudden soldiers fall out of the sky in the soccer field, and one of them implores the audience: ""We are you 30 years from now! We need you to fight with us!"" And with that, the stakes couldn't be higher: literally the end of human kind is in the balance... At this point we are 10 min. Into the film.Couple of comments: this movie is directed by Chris McKay, erstwhile of the ""Lego"" movie franchise. Here he directs a big budget sci-fi action thriller. The good news is that when we finally get to the battle scenes (the first major battle scene comes about 40 min. Into the movie), it is quite entertaining, even if very heavy on the CGI side of things. (It's another 15-20 min. Before we finally get to see the ""aliens"".) The not so good news is that the dialogue throughout the movie is beyond embarrassing and cringe-worthy, as if written up for first graders. Check the scene between Dan (played by Chris Platt) and his dad (played by J. K. Rollins) and listen to it. It blows the mind. Keep you eye out for Mary Lynn Rasjkub (of ""24"" tv fame). Bottom line: it is almost inconceivable to reconcile the amateurish dialogue with the elaborated action scenes, not to mention that at 2 hrs. 20 min., the film runs about 20-30 min. Too long for its own good.""The Tomorrow War"" was supposed to be released in theaters last Fall, but then COVID-19 had other plans. Eventually Amazon bought the film for a reported $200 million (!), and just now released it on Prime, Amazon Instant Video and other platforms. TWO HUNDRED MILLION!

They inform the government the people of tomorrow need troops from today to stop an alien invasion. Can fathers and mothers fight along their children to save the future? This movie is directed by Chris McKay (Robot Chicken and Lego Batman) and stars Chris Pratt (Guardians of the Galaxy), Yvonne Strahovski (Handmaid's Tale), JK Simmons (Spider-man) and Alexis Louder (Watchmen). The storyline for this is very intricate, well thought out and perfectly executed. It did remind me of Starship Troopers in some ways (in terms of plot, not in terms of look and feel of the movie). Several of the aspects were predictable but the special effects, action scenes and intensity is well done. You really felt the situation was hopeless the entire movie. The aliens were fairly unique and the special effects to create them was excellent. The acting is also very good. Overall this is a must see and great addition to the science fiction genre.

In fact even the action which is wholly the good guys shooting the creatures with never run out of bullets machine guns do drag plus the fun to be had from tricky time tricks is wasted.

36,masonfisk,REALLY GOOD BUT JUST DON'T THINK ABOUT IT...!,7,12 July 2021,"An Amazon Prime original starring Chris Pratt is long on excitement & short on logic as we delve into a yarn where in our present day world, soldiers from 30 years in the future appear at a televised soccer event pleading for their help in a future war where humans have been decimated by creatures (from God's knows where). In quick fashion Pratt, currently a high school science teacher but w/a military past, is indoctrinated to fight (along w/other civilians who do not have any service history but fit a certain criteria to journey to the future) where they're transported to a devastated landscape where their goal is to recover vials of blue serum from a research lab. Once reaching the facility, the creatures (looking like albino cousins of the ones seen in A Quiet Place) lay in wait which when finally roused decimate the squad to single digits w/Pratt reaching a safe zone (a series of offsite drilling platforms surrounded by giant walls). Along the way, Pratt meets the older version of his daughter, played The Handmaid's Tale's Yvonne Strahovski, a commander on the base & following in her dad's footsteps, a research scientist. The goal is to synthesize a virus from the recovered serum to infect the queen (since all the males are engineered to protect her) & hopefully turn the tide of the war. Skipping over the fact the creatures are showing signs of intelligence (which goes over the characters' heads), the creatures mount a decisive attack on the base as Pratt zaps back to the past w/a successful virus setting up a last siege where a small group of soldiers, including Pratt's estranged dad, played by Oscar winner J. K. Simmons, mount an attack on the creatures' dormant lair. Taking elements from Starship Troopers, World War Z & the more successfully mounted Edge of Tomorrow, the film works as a piece of mindless spectacle (a neat butt clencher sees the future zap, which they're assured is safe, stranding falling troops in midair as they arrive in the future) w/a lot of questions (how was the time travel tech developed?) left on the floor maybe to be answered in a another installment (since a sequel has been green-lit already) w/the actors given momentary slivers to gel any character traits the audience may glom sympathies upon.

37,aidanratesmovies,Meh,5,11 July 2021,"Entertaining and at times enticing, but all together quite shallow, The Tomorrow War is yet another sci-fi dud for Chris Pratt that takes action and visuals over its complex story. Remember the movie Passengers from 2016? This reminds me deeply of that, not just because of Pratt and its sci-fi nature, but how it squanders its potential. The Tomorrow War focuses on a rather interesting story and does little to nothing valuable with it. There are so many moments in here where the writing feels incredibly lazy, rushed, and simply mistoned. The film can largely feel like a comedy at times but its forced humor nearly never works- and its more serious moments and storylines are often comedic from how seriously it takes itself. I get the film has Pratt and he is a funny and likable personality, but the film can't decide which tone it wants to take, and honestly feels quite messy because of it. The CGI can also seem incredibly obvious at times, and the film can also just be predictable- even to the point of frustration- because you simply feel like it's killing time with all of its formulaic tendencies. If that is still fine with you, to be honest you'll probably like the film. Yes it has its major flaws and isn't as great as it could have been, but thanks to Pratt and the direction- the film is rather entertaining. And even though t can seem a bit melodramatic, the film does a good job of making you care for the characters at hand. In the end, The Tomorrow War isn't anything special- but if you are willing to turn your brain off for a couple of hours than this might be a film for you.My Rating: 4.5/10.",The Tomorrow War

39,TheFearmakers,Not as Good... Or as Horrible... As it could have been,6,2 July 2021,"One thing the director got right was taking what I call the ""Kong 45-minute mark"" before showing the aliens (in the original King Kong, despite everyone knowing what and especially WHO the movie's about, it still takes half the movie)...

41,davidmvining,Contradictory and Really Stupid,2,20 July 2021,"This was excessively stupid. It honestly feels like it was written by AI, not a human. It has all the pieces you expect from a large-budgeted scifi action vehicle starring an established action star, but nothing makes any sense, the emotional catharsis is completely manufactured and feels incredibly fake while being entirely unearned, and it veers wildly from intentionally silly to unintentionally hilarious without a single sense that anyone involved in the movie has any sense of tone in the least. But hey, stuff blew up good and the music swelled at the end, so it felt like a good time, I guess.The future has come back to the past to recruit soldiers to fight a war in the future. Already, this movie is excessively stupid based on just the concept, but other movies have survived dumber concepts without descending into constant stupidity. However, The Tomorrow War rises to the challenge and actually goes out of its way to prove that it's really dumb.Chris Pratt plays James Forester, a retired sergeant in the Green Berets who teaches high school biology. During his World Cup viewing party he proves that he loves his wife and daughter very much (this is important to the movie's stupidity, by the way) while struggling to make a difference in the world (I mean, just...ugh). Then the people from the future show up, and we skip ahead a year. In that year, thousands of people have been sent forward every week to fight with return numbers settling around 20%. The worldwide draft is killing off most of the people drafted, and tensions are rising. Of course, James gets drafted, and then the movie goes out of its way to prove to the audience that the movie is really, really stupid.Time mechanics are hard to figure out in fiction. They require a good deal of thought to consider how to make the whole moving backwards and forwards in time actually make sense. The Tomorrow War takes its time to explain how its mechanics work, but then spends the rest of the movie ignoring all of it. I don't think I'd be nearly as irritated with this film if they had simply cut out the scene explaining the time travel. Keep it as a handwave without actually explaining, and we can go along. But, since the movie explained it, I'll recap. The time portal that opens and closes between the two times means that the two times are linked together, moving along forward at the same rate. So, when someone goes into the future and then sent back seven days in the future later, seven days have also passed in the past, like two boats moving at the same rate in a river, one ahead of the other.Where this becomes a huge problem is the entire emotional narrative of the film hinges on those mechanics not being right.So, for reasons, instead of given a week of training, James' troop must go the first night they're there, and something happens with the coordinates so the entire platoon appears hundreds of feet in the air above Miami, still standing above water after the melting of the icecaps. James happens to fall into a pool on top of a high rise, miraculously surviving along with a handful of others. They had to jump early because the alien forces in the future were attacking Miami and the human research facility there that had some really important research. So, what are the humans doing in the future? Planning on bombing Miami to the stone ages. So,...they have to save the research that the humans are going to destroy themselves? I mean...this honestly feels like it was written by an AI.People die in slow motion with music of import playing, so we think emotionally affecting things are happening (they're not), and James survives a massive explosion really close to him to wake up and find that his daughter is now a colonel in the military and has rescued him, bringing him to the Dominican Republic. Here's where it gets super stupid. You see, Yvonne Strahovski's Muri is really mad at James because, several years after James left for the future, he abandoned the family, leaving Muri alone. Now, this is wrong on two levels. The first is the time travel level. This makes no damn sense. If the two times are moving along at the same rate, then James is gone from the past completely and he could never have abandoned his family because he got sent to the future. If this is because James eventually went back and survived his trip, then there's no dramatic tension because we know he goes back. Time travel is hard to figure out, and the AI that wrote this movie (the credits say its name is Zach Dean) spent no time trying to figure it out because either way, it either makes no sense or robs the film of all tension. The other way this is wrong is character based.You see, James hasn't done what Muri is accusing him of doing. This is akin to her waking up from a dream where he had done something wrong and James needing to make up for it. He hasn't left her and her mother. The only time we saw him and Muri together in the past was where they were a loving father and daughter pair, happily watching the World Cup together. When the movie comes to an end and James promises his daughter that he'll never leave her, it means nothing because he never did leave her. He started as a loving dad and ends as a loving dad. It's not a journey. It's him staying in place with music swelling like he has taken an emotional journey. I mean, this movie is really stupid.And that doesn't even get to the stupidity at the heart of the human plans for the aliens, the White Spikes. You see, in the future they've developed a toxin for the males, but they can't get it to work on the females. So, daddy and daughter use science to figure it out, developing just that toxin from a captured female. Having the female at their remote ocean base attracts a huge mass of males that attack, ultimately leading Muri to dying and James going back in time just in time to save him because of course. The attack, though, knocks out the link between past and present, and James, along with a couple of his buddies, are stuck in the past with this female toxin.Well, what to do? Well, they do what the scientists of the world had, apparently, collectively decided to not do: figure out where the White Spikes originated from, quickly (I mean, really quickly) discovering that they were buried under the ice in Russia for thousands of years instead of falling to the earth some decades hence. Seriously, this movie is really stupid. So, without permission, James enlists his father (J. K. Simmons) to fly them to Russia where they ultimately beat the female by hitting her in the face with an icepick. Where did that toxin go? Was it necessary? I guess not. Well, that just invalidates the middle section of the film, I suppose.This movie has the veneer of an entertaining blockbuster like Independence Day, but it definitely is not that. Independence Day was able to rise about its questions about how a Mac could interface with an alien ship through solid character work and a plot that made sense. The Tomorrow War is a complete hodgepodge of bad ideas flying at each other without any sense of what could or could not work. It doesn't know because it was written by an AI.This was one of the worst big budget action movies I've seen in a long time.",The Tomorrow War

43,rgkarim,The War For Balance and Budget Brings an enjoyable Sci-Fi Film That Still Needs Some Time,7,2 July 2021,"LIKESVisual Effects Are Good for Me:
A lot of CGI in the making, but it's something a gamer like me loves to see in these films. The carnage of the war, the design of the hives, and plenty of futuristic looks are included in this film and for direct to release not the worst bit to come out of the woodwork.Pacing:
Take this with a grain of salt, but the pacing is actually decent for one aspect of the movie in terms of intensity and timeline. The story sets up a limitation, and unlike what Hollywood does, the time dilation is fairly minimized and leads to always putting a little edge and distraught into sequence to try and keep you on your toes. There are few slow parts in this film, and even the science stuff moves at an entertaining pace without sacrificing too muchScience is decently real:
For a movie based on science fiction, I'm impressed with the steps they took to show the real life application and struggles science has. So many films choose to bring the miracle factor and serendipity, but this film shows a far more logical process and does not bog you into the details that will put some to sleep. Nice workActing
While certainly not the Oscar roles that seem to popular, the performances were just fine on most fronts when the characters were used. Chris Pratt may not be the Tom Cruise or Statham when it comes to action emotions, but I think he did fine in this movie, especially when it came to the drama elements that pulled a little more out of the one emotion spectrum. Yvonne Strahovski, the other focus, a fantastic addition, feeling very at home in this film as the role of a military leader/scientist. She had the discipline and heroic components down, did nice work of interacting with a bunch of the other actors, and her dramatic components were by far the strongest of the bunch. Simmons is again fantastic in his work, funny in his execution, and using his gruff voice to somehow be a multi-tiered character that makes him a continued joy to watch. Many other actors succeeded in their roles as well, I'll hit on their strengths later, but let's move on.Comedy:
Would not be a Chris Pratt film without some comedy right? The movie manages to do well for me with some of the well placed lines and situations that were meant to be humorous. Sam Richardson succeeded in using the manic pace of nerves to his advantage and is almost like the Groot/Drax of the bunch to help lighten the darker motifs of the movie. Other characters have their interjections as well, but the highlight for me is that the comedy is not pushed too much or forced on me the way Disney does. I enjoyed the balance and felt it never overtook the other themes of the movie, which meant plenty of time for the other elements promised in the trailers.The Drama/Character building
For two characters the drama and character building are decent, if not a little ill placed. Being used to help elevate some dynamics and integrating that into the story, it added a little dimension to a linear tale, and elevated the stakes a bit more. Avoiding that typical Syfy elements of either sexy couple having romance or merely alien fodder, I wished some of the other dynamics had been as strong as this bond, to help bring cohesion to this movie about soldier dynamics.The First Battle:
When the first action sequence hits, the movie finally delivered the punch I was looking for from the trailers. It had suspense, it felt like there were mission elements to it, and it felt decently real despite the concept. A good mixture of survival elements meets blasting, Tomorrow War's first fight felt like something out of Aliens, lining up the potential for what it was to come. Again, the gamer in me felt there was some Gears of War elements inspiring it and all the involvement, coordination, and the special effects made this sequence the highlight for me for this movie.DISLIKES:
The sound quality: I don't think it's my sound bar, but the sound levels were very unbalanced for me in this film. Many scenes are again reduced to mumbling, while the action scenes are ready to blow your speakers apart like much of the scenes in this film. As such, more investment into what other studios do to provide better sound balance without having to constantly adjust your volumeThe Story
I did not hate this story at all, in fact felt that it was quite strong in some parts that had there been more time, like a mini-series, it would have been better. However, the Tomorrow War's decent opening soon starts to suffer from the pace I stated earlier and compress so much into the final 48 minutes or so of the film. That dynamic I told you about stays strong, but so many other things are dropped, and the convenience factor starts to take precedent once more for a mad rush to the end. Throw in the predictable elements for the twists, and the story starts to degrade further and further.Character Usage:
Another thing to suffer from the pace and time is the use of other characters this film does a big job trying to build up. J. K Simmons, Sam Richardson, and several other key characters are reduced to background noise for much of the film. Despite some promising interactions and an epic involvement in that first fight, they will later go on to do very little until those last 48 minutes or so. Such a shame given the talent, and honestly better acting abilities for this movie being lost, and again an idea for how this movie could have done well as a small time series.The Speeches:
Writing motivational speeches is a challenge these days, given what the past was able to pull out. Tomorrow War's, inspiring moments are a little preachy and cheesy to watch in this film despite the music, sound editing, and set up they tried to use. A little political agenda thrown in to the writing, and well... it only dilutes from the less scripted writing most of the movie has.The Other Action Sequences:
Some say the fights are bland and boring, and I was surprised to hear this given that first scene. But soon I learned what they meant as the movie progressed. Another time crunch casualty, the second fight has some moxie behind it even though we start mid operation and see some of the chaos ensure. A little agenda lead decisions fuels the fight, and the science fiction component I like starts to take on references to an Avenger's movie that feels out of place. However, this is still good compared to the final two fights, which suddenly fall victim to overhead shots, ambiguous editing to give just enough to of the fight without any meat, and only a little sustenance in the form of an out of place brawl that while funny and epic, again misses the mark of the gernes. These moments could have again been much better with more time and involvement, but budget got in the way.The VERDICT:Overall, Tomorrow War is actually a decent science fiction movie that shows with a little more time and planning the age of good Sci-Fi is not dead. Special effects were not awful, as the chaotic future battlefield unleashes it's wrath on the action scenes that they had in store. Acting is good, especially the secondary characters, and there is a very good balance of drama, comedy, and action to give this movie more depth than originally expected. However, the movie's biggest struggle comes in the form of the pacing and time crunch that affected a lot of other elements of the movie. Characters are underutilized, bonds promised are not quite as strong, and the story conveniences really start to weaken in the last hour of the film. Even more so, the action itself loses the pizazz the first fight did and I would have loved more time to really lets these battles shine. I think this would have been a great mini-series over movie, but this reviewer r still approves giving this film a shot should you have some time, and Amazon Prime.My scores are:Action/Adventure/Sci-Fi/Drama: 7.0

45,rannynm,Kicking it off for the summer movie session with 2 hours of straight action,6,2 July 2021,"The Tomorrow War is here kicking alien butt, and kicking off our summer movie season with two hours of straight action, complete with a beautifully composed soundtrack. This is a solid sci-fi action film with a fantastic soundtrack. It possesses generic family origins that can be seen in practically any other film and has plenty of gory moments with mild cursing.The Tomorrow War follows an aspiring scientist/father, Dan Forester (Chris Pratt) as his life changes forever. Dan, along with the entire world, learns of a war being fought 30 years in the future. When more people are needed for this future war, a worldwide draft is put in place to send recruits 30 years into the future to fight. Dan is drafted into the war, and must fight to save not only his own life, but the lives of the ones he loves the most.Chris Pratt continues to prove himself worthy of a wide variety of roles, yet is driven by cliché themes seen in countless other films. The nonstop action is interspersed throughout the film with certain comedic moments to lighten the mood from the major intensity this film brings. Some CGI and effects are mind-blowing initially, but the film reuses them over and over again to the point where it becomes repetitive and the details lose their importance. The soundtrack in The Tomorrow War is exquisite. It embodies the dark and gritty tone of the film perfectly, adding an intense layer pleasing to the ears. The film uses a lot of repetitive techniques that are extremely noticeable. Specifically, slow motion. It's used in tons of unnecessary scenes, really disrupting the proper flow of the film; making it seem bulky in some parts.The film teaches the moral that relationships can be repaired, and family is forever. The Tomorrow War is rated PG-13 for good reasons. Over the course of the film, many instances of disturbing action are shown along with mild cursing. The action at times can be very gory, which may be a sensitive issue to younger viewers. Sensitive, mature topics present themselves throughout the film, such as family abandonment. At the same time, larger themes like love and kin are shown.I give The Tomorrow War 3 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 12 to 18, plus adults. You can watch The Tomorrow War streaming on Amazon Prime Video beginning July 2, 2021.Reviewed by Jude A., KIDS FIRST!",The Tomorrow War
46,mhorg2018,Would it HURT to try and have a little logic?,1,6 July 2021,"Another lame, over special effected attempt at making the audience get involved in a movie with just too many illogical moments. Beware, there are a lot of spoilers coming up. This movie is only SLIGHTLY better than A Quiet Place (and no, I haven't gotten up the nerve to watch the sequel yet), but it also falls into the WHY DOESN'T ANYONE HAVE A ZERO RATING category. In a nutshell, people of 2023 are called upon by their children and grandchildren to go into the future to help the 500,000 remaining humans battle aliens since, like in the even lamer A Quiet Place-most of the earth's military has been-gasp!-WIPED OUT. So problem number one-these people show up while thanks to time travel-untrained (mostly, Chris Pratt is a veteran) to battle these aliens. Each serves a week, and then gets to go home as long as they're mostly alive. HOWEVER, problem number 2: when one person says why not just be there when the aliens show up and slaughter them? Oh, can't do that, time only flows in one direction. SOOOOO, if this is true-how the &*#k! Are these 'volunteers' (drafted from the future actually) getting back home? Of course the hero, Pratt discovers that something bad happened to him in 2030 (hint-he dies) and in an obvious trope that really should have been avoided-his daughter-who watched him die after a car accident, and divorcing her mother-is the chief scientist! Well, everyone goes back to the present, along with the daughter created toxin and they discover (in a lift from the far better The Thing-both versions) that the alien spacecraft that delivered the space fleas to earth crashed thousands of years ago and was frozen in the ice! Sooo, Pratt goes to his estranged father and he and his team sneak into Russia (the world is torn by riots because of anti-future war protesting, the lone thing in this movie I found believable), yes, that's believable. A nation known for its paranoia and a bunch of schmucks sneak right in. They find the alien ship whose crew died in the crash but the space fleas survived. They inject the creatures with the toxin, fight the lone female hand to hand, and ta-dah! The future is saved!My lone question is: DOES ANYONE WRITING THIS CRAP THINK BEYOND THE ""Oh this is so cool?"" part? I doubt it.The lone positive: the movie wasn't PCed and Woke to death. A rarity these days.Let's just say, I hope this trash movie doesn't (but it probably will) generate a sequel. NOT EVERYTHING NEEDS A SEQUEL or a TV SERIES!",The Tomorrow War

51,Abdulxoxo,Suitably entertaining,7,2 August 2021,"The Tomorrow War certainly delivered on the action and thrill. The battle scenes were exciting and although not original, there was a constant sense of dread. Chris Pratt was different in this film. He may not be a convincing high school teacher (granted his own character even seemed uninterested in it) but he was convincing as a military man.The movie also used seemingly random set pieces that eventually would contribute to the bigger picture that the story was aiming for. It was a good way to keep the audience guessing especially if they were paying attention to details all throughout the film. The production design and props were also good. However, the plot was filled with holes. Granted that most movies have plot holes, this one quite took those plot holes and explained them in a rather shoving manner. The movie used time travel as a plot device which is one of the most convoluted and complicated plot devices to use. The movie set aside those plot holes using convenient explanations to get the story moving. But it would not work because towards the climax the story took a turn creating a time paradox, again something that would confuse the audiences. While the action pieces were good, for some reason the movie was filled with many visual spectacles to keep the audiences focused on the action and not the actual story.On the whole, The Tomorrow War is far from a great movie but definitely it is a good movie for those who just want to watch a film and be entertained.",The Tomorrow War

53,arungeorge13,Solid but imminently forgettable sci-fi action fare! [+54%],5,4 July 2021,"A film that can easily be lambasted for its hackneyed screenplay and thoroughly inspired sci-fi world-building, The Tomorrow War's strength lies in its cast and visual craft. The first set-piece, which arrives around the 37-minute mark (after the initial flashback), is actually pretty great to look at. All the characters, including Pratt's, are lifted straight outta the Hollywood action movie encyclopedia. Aside from its bizarre time-travel plot point (which gets weirder as the film progresses), there's plenty of familial sentiment added. It only helps that the lead roles are played by the likes of Chris Pratt, J. K Simmons, and Yvonne Strahovski. Sci-fi absurdity pervades all through, and if you're left with a list of why questions after several key scenes, the makers politely ask you to keep them to yourselves, because we're talking big, illogical summer action fare here.Everything you see in The Tomorrow War is derived from superior sci-fi spectacles of the past (be it Aliens, Predator, Edge of Tomorrow, Independence Day, or even World War Z) . A couple of set pieces would have been nice to witness on the big screen, but that's about it. Several plot points make zero sense. What's the point of sending untrained civilians aged 40+ to fight aliens in the future? Why is a school-going kid deemed the ultimate expert on volcanoes? Why does the Defence Secretary act like he can't send a team to Russia but can send thousands of human guinea pigs into the future to be alien fodder? What's the point of having a toxin when bombing the spaceship was the obvious decision to make? We, as audiences, are not meant to take any of this seriously. We're only expected to say ""yeah, let's roll"" to everything. Thankfully, the cinematographer Larry Fong and the film's VFX department are both solid in what they deliver. The creatures can be viewed in broad daylight without rapid cuts and shaky cam, which is a welcome relief.",The Tomorrow War

I had good time watching as I can pause and could return back to it. Chris Pratt and cast did a decent job considering predictable storyline.My major complaint is Since when we have started to accept Video Games like graphics into movies as Acceptable? I feel like that they've even stop trying to make an effort to smooth out the graphics and use real sets where it can built instead of shooting all on green screens. That's out of the most things takes me out of any fun of watching the movie. If i want to watch a video game, i'll go to YouTube and watch people playing videogames.They need to do better, and I reckon as consumers we need to demand better than what has been bestowed upon us in recent times on the name of Big Budget Movies. Instead of going big and bold you can make compelling graphics like in recent A Quiet Place 1 and 2. That's more impactful and has less than half the budget of this one.",The Tomorrow War

Chris Pratt played himself with endearing awkwardness, always a winning turn.There were some wonderful lines delivered with absolute sincerity, like ""I wasn't going to sit around and watch my daughter be eaten I am still your dad"", what a gem!The CGI was comprehensive throughout and aliens were a mixture of t-Rex, war of the worlds and Alien.Overall this was a firm 7 out of 10, meaning it was just pure fun and entertainment and I loved it!",The Tomorrow War

From one combat scene to the next, the rules seem to change on how to kill them.They fire a million rounds into them with no effect whatsoever. Bellies and necks we are told are their soft spots. So, should we rub them or shoot them? And like all of bad movies of this genre, you can only kill them when it is necessary for the plot for them to die.The aliens are fast enough to run down a moving vehicle, yet sometimes the her can outrun them.They have advanced combat aircraft, yet the choose to fight with foot soldiers carrying small caliber weapons.",The Tomorrow War

Out of desperation the representatives of the future work with the world's governments for reinforcements in their losing war and out of desperation eventually turn to civilian drafts. Dan Forester (Chris Pratt) is eventually drafted and forced to leave behind his Emmy (Betty Gilpin) and daughter Muri (Ryan Kiera Armstrong). Now thrown 30 years into the future Dan must work with other conscripts to fight against the alien menace and save the future of the world.Directed by noted animation director (Lego Batman Movie, Robot Chicken) and based on an original IP by Zach Dean, The Forever War marks the latest push for Skydance Media current stewards of the Mission: Impossible and Star Trek films to build their own lucrative self sustaining franchise. The Tomorrow War has an intriguing hook of a future war recruiting people from the past to fight and there is an intriguing idea that is flirted with, but all to often the movie settles for standard large scale battle sequences and familiar blockbuster tropes that don't do much to distinguish itself.The movie can really be divided into two parts: The present and the future, both are given roughly equal screen time and there's a difference in how they're approached. The scenes in the present I found myself to be much more invested in as there's an interesting emphasis placed on mystery and intrigue that works well to the films advantage. Even once we know what's going on there's some interesting questions posed (which are setups for future installments should this become a franchise) and easily the most thematically rich material and characterizations are on display in this part in the movie. The future on the other hand is basically a loud bombastic near non-stop barrage of action setpieces that while well staged become quite repetitive. I think the biggest issue with the future sequences is that they feel like a more serious and dour version of Edge of Tomorrow (or Live Die Repeat) and unfortunately unlike the Mimics from that film, the Whitespikes aren't nearly as interesting as while their designs are creative, they're basically a gender switched version of the dragons from Reign of Fire with the same end point established except instead of a male dragon it's a female Whitespike that serves as our objective.The action sequences are also a mixed bag. I tended to like the action sequences when they were scaled back and put into claustrophobic spaces such as a scene in a stairwell, or a scene in the third act. Other larger scale sequences were often so busy with too many moving parts and details I found myself overwhelmed by too much detail that wasn't given the weight or polish it needed and reminded me of similar overdone sequences such as the ""zombie pile"" from World War Z.The Tomorrow War is rather standard blockbuster material, but it is well made and has a decent premise as well as a promising live-action debut for Chris McKay.

The cinematography and visuals were near perfect with a few jumpy moments in there and acting was just great adding a little humor and light comedy at times.The idea of the movie was very good had some genuinity and it made made think of reverse terminator somehow ;) Now the plot is where the movie falls short,,, starts with the explanation of time travel , they tried to but all I got is ""time is like a river flows only in one direction"" !! Like come on!!The other thing, about which most people were furious, is that how a just a bunch of people have to save whole humanity instead of asking the UN for more troops and uniting countries to get more soldiers and kill aliens in Russia .. While I do agree to a point where we know how politics work .. I mean we've seen the UN struggling 50+ years trying to solve some global issues without a single progress ,, so this how politics work and how action movies do, One man gotta save humanity.The other issue is saving Muri and few people in the future ,, the movie did somehow bring the idea of going to future again to save the people in the future !! I mean thankfully they didn't stress on that idea,, I mean If you kill aliens in the present , then they seize to exist in the future, right !! No problems there so why try to milk it.. but again this all comes due to the lack of explanation of their idea on time travel.The cast were great, from Chris to Sam Richardson and J. K.

They don't even talk about it! (At least invent a new set of rules that do not make sense, but they magically do in this world! Nothing). Etc.In the end, it has enough sentimentality to be a good watch with your pre-teens kids and the whole family, without expecting anything remotely interesting in any form. Well, that is if you accept the huge amount of violence and alien blood. It's just bad and Chris Pratt wasn't even charming in this one.PD: Why it felt like watching ""The Happening"" at times (the first act, mostly)? It's that bad.",The Tomorrow War

70,bankofmarquis,"Sloggy to start, becomes solid Summer Fare in the end",6,16 July 2021,"The reviews that I had read before I watched the Chris Pratt/Alien Invaders flick THE TOMORROW WAR was that it was a pretty okay film for the first hour and a half, but goes ""off the rails"" in the last 1/2 hour.I couldn't disagree more. The Tomorrow War is a safe and confined film for the first hour and a half and only becomes interesting when they take off all constraints and ""goes for it"" in the last 1/2 hour.Directed by Chris McKay (THE LEGO MOVIE), THE TOMORROW WAR follows a working class guy (Chris Pratt) who is recruited to head into the future to help fight alien invaders. He teams up with one of the leaders of the ""Tomorrow War"" (Yvonne Strahovski) for whom he has a special bond with to recapture Earth for the humans.The premise is solid enough, but the Direction by McKay keeps the film in the ""safe zone"", never veering away into anything interesting and original, almost like McKay wanted to keep the events of the future ""believable"". This is a miscalculation by McKay (and Pratt) and makes the film ""fine"", but not much more than that.Pratt's performance is also in the ""safe zone"" and tones down his usual daffy charm and charisma - rarely a good idea with a Movie Star who relies on these qualities. Strahovski is solid and believable (enough) as the tough-as-nails scientist as one of the leaders of the future humans. She and Pratt worked well off each other and this helped get me through the middle of this film (where it sags under the weight of it's own pretentions).Also along for the ride is Sam Richardson (VEEP) as a fellow Tomorrow War draftee who provides much needed comic relief in the first part of the film. But he does veer into the ""over-acting/caricature"" territory that these types of parts can lead to. It was also good to see Mary Lynn Rajskub (Chloe in the TV Series 24) up on the screen again. I was rooting for her throughout the film.But it is the work of the always great J. K. Simmons that salvages the film. He only appears in 1 scene in the first 3/4 of this movie - he is the estranged father of Pratt's character - but when these 2 join forces for the last 1/2 hour, the film takes a dramatic turn to the Summer Blockbuster over-the-top action hero fun flick that it probably needed to be from the beginning. Simmons looks like he is having a blast taking out Alien after Alien and Pratt suddenly looks interested and his natural charm and charisma comes out.Watch the first hour and a half as a setup for the last 1/2 hour. If you are looking for mindless Summer entertainment, the final part of this film will fit the bill, indeed.Letter Grade: B- (the first hour and a half takes some initiative to get through)6 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",The Tomorrow War

But I liked how there was an answer at the end and there was a final conclusion that made sense and it was imo written very well! But my favorite part was the lil' story within the big story! That was when he came home and he realized what he had and the gratitude flooded back into his face and the acting from ol' boy did a great job! All around , from the mom and the lil' girl and everyone in it. And I was tripping cause I knew I saw the lil' girl in something so I checked her IMDB and realized I just had saw her Anne with an E!

75,Snootz,Just another violent over-the-top monster movie,5,4 July 2021,"If you go into this looking for an adrenaline rush, that's what you'll get. The acting, CGI and directing is pretty much what you'd expect from any ""Transformers"" grade movie. The alien monsters are particularly vicious-- and thus the movie exceedingly violent and the body count incredibly high and graphic.Question: Has no one from the present or future heard of explosive rounds or grenade launchers? Let's just send into global war untrained civilians armed with popguns. Start the movie with that gaping plot weakness and watch it go downhill from there. There is so very much in this movie that makes no logical sense. Frankly, the humans of this Earth need to be destroyed because they're as stupid as... well, I guess as our own global society. What should we expect, sensible strategy? Isn't it amazing in these types of movies how the entire armed forces of Earth are totally inadequate in overcoming what are basically horse-sized monsters? I mean seriously.At one point I found myself sitting here wondering how much longer the movie is going to last and whether or not they were going to end it sensibly. If the viewing audience has a chance to wonder such things, the movie has already failed.Overall it's basically a humans vs the nasty aliens flick and has nothing that pulls it above any other similar film that's ever been made. It's just one battle after another, one gory fight after another. The last third of the film devolves into senselessness, where the audience can already figure out about a dozen solutions to the menace before they ever get around to figuring out one in the film. That's pretty sad.If you're looking for thrill a minute with no real content, this will suffice. But don't go in looking for a special plot or contrivance. Just about every minute of this movie will be either predictable or unsurprising.",The Tomorrow War

81,kjproulx,"A Sloppy, Inconsistent Good Time",7,7 July 2021,"Unless you get rare films like Back to the Future, Looper, or even subtle ones like Safety Not Guaranteed, films revolving around time travel are nearly never flawlessly executed. From inconsistencies with minor details to how it's all explained, time travel is very hard to convey properly. Originally made for the big screen, Paramount Pictures decided to sell their film The Tomorrow War to Amazon, so it's now available to stream on Prime Video, which I'm sure will be the only way to view it for a long time. It's honestly a shame that this film didn't play on the big screen, because it's very obvious it was made that way. Full of issues but still a fun viewing experience, here are my thoughts on The Tomorrow War.From the very first trailer alone, I was interested in the premise of this movie. In the year 2022, soldiers appear from the future to warn everyone that in 2051 the world will go extinct and be taken over by a race that they call ""White Spikes"". A draft is then started to acquire soldiers from the present to fight in the future. Trying to be the best family man he can be and looking to further his career, Dan (Chris Pratt) now has to risk his life, as he is one of the most recent draftees. Having a military background, he becomes exactly what the teams needs and he leads them the best he can.This film is very much divided into sections that all seem to begin and end, which makes for a movie that, in turn, feels its length. I had a blast with all of the big action set pieces, due to the fact I found the creature designs to be unique and they never once glamourized them. The sound design is great and the action scenes are very loud, which made for a very exciting first couple of acts. By the time the third act begins though, I found the film became insanely predictable, which it already was from the beginning. Aside from being predictable from start to finish, it's still a very entertaining movie that cares about its characters.It's not that these elements ruined the film or anything, but when you set up actors in your first act that you know will pay off later, and they don't do anything to make you think they won't follow through, it can feel a little easy. The final act of this film plays out very simply. It almost felt like they put too much effort into the concept itself that they decided to wrap up the film in a very breezy way. Yes, there are consequences and certain relationships worked for me in terms of emotion, but again, it didn't all jive well together when looking back on it.Overall, The Tomorrow War is the perfect kind of film to put on if you're just looking for a film to relax and eat a bowl of popcorn to. Chris Pratt is very likeable as Dan and I also thought Yvonne Strahovski was great as well, sharing some nice chemistry with Pratt. As for the rest of the cast, most were there as either deadweight or comedic relief, even though a few of them have moments to shine. I had a blast with the spectacle of the film and even liked the family aspect of it all, but there is also a lot that's missing, even at 138 minutes. Now streaming on Prime Video, The Tomorrow War, if for nothing else, is worth the watch if you're an action or Sci-Fi fan.",The Tomorrow War
82,kuarinofu,"Forget the interesting ideas, shoot the creatures aaaaaaahhh",5,3 July 2021,"What a wacky apocalypse this one is. Humanity will surely go extinct in the funniest way possible.But seriously, this is as dumb as an alien invasion action blockbuster can get. This is Airship, this is Pacific Rim, but the second one, this is ID: Resurgence, Battle: Los Angeles, whatever.The creators staked on effects, action scenes, and, oddly enough, Chris Pratt. I thought he was going to direct, but, turns out, he was producing.The film is plagued with problems: 1) Chris Pratt is still Peter Quill, not enough time has passed after the Marvel films; 2) The interesting setup was just a bait and switch; 3) The concept of the father-daughter scene in the future, not that it was stolen from Marvel (it has been done before Endgame), but it still does not provide the necessary emotional impact: 4) I did not dig the wacky tone of the film; 5) The writing died around 90 minutes in when the other...part of the film started after the film practically...ended, whatever; 6) The motivations of all the characters hold on like a million of assumptions, all of which turn out to be true; 7) The main character is your every male superhero ever created; 8) The amount of pain and damage these creatures can take is completely random, so the action scenes do not give the viewer an understanding of when the main characters are in danger and when they can easily deal with the enemy; 9) The soundtrack is generic.There were some good things I did like though. Some of the alien design elements were interesting, although there was no alien lore at all (besides stealing from After Earth). The CGI was well-done, with only some of the green screens noticeable. Some of the action pieces were cool, but there were like 2 of those, one with a heli, and one with back-to-back shooting.I don't hate on this film or anything, but there's really no reason to watch it. You've seen it all before, you know what to expect. In the first like 30 minutes, the film tries to bait you it's something cool like the Edge of Tomorrow, but it's not, it's not even Oblivion.All in all, this is the definition of the word ""generic"".

With the impending doom in 2051, citizens in 2022 were recruited to help fighting the war 30 years in the future.So summer started for about a month now, and I had to say this was the first summer spectacle that I have seen. It was a global war against creatures that seemed too fast and furious for humans. This was by far the best part. Every action scene felt grandiose with tons of explosion, shooting, and creatures wrecking havoc on the soldiers. The designs of the creatures were incredible, and this made the action scenes intense and immensely entertaining. Clearly a lot of budget was put into this, and I was very pleased with all the actions.However, the characters were unfortunately cheesy. The side ones were straightforward and even goofy. I appreciated that the story built a theme of not abandoning others around the main character and his family. It did get me to care a bit about our main character, but not enough because it's something that I have seen a lot before. Because of this, whenever the character development scenes came up, I often wanted for the action to return.After about an hour and 45 minutes, I honestly thought this movie already ended. However, there was still 30 minutes to go. While the first part was awesome, I found the last 30 minutes unnecessary. The way that the characters realized something was goofy and didn't really match the overall tone of the movie. However, it was still an excuse for some great action with the creatures, and I again thoroughly enjoyed the last action scenes.Overall, a spectacular sci-fi action despite its weak characters. 8.5/10.",The Tomorrow War
84,katyayan-12892,Worth a watch,7,12 July 2021,"Review By Kamal KIn the opening shots of The Tomorrow War, Dan Forester (Pratt) is about to enter his house where they are hosting a Halloween party. As he walks across the porch, a blowup Halloween doll comes in centre-frame. The inanimate object flutters in the wind, and its head slowly tilts towards the camera, as if it were alive. Those few seconds are enough to establish a foreground for the narrative.A sudden human intervention reveals to the present world that mankind will come under major threat in the next couple of decades, following an alien invasion. In the raging tussle between man and beast, humans are fast disintegrating to a point of extinction. The future humans ask for public help, and through a process of ""drafting,"" calls upon eligible candidates to time travel till 2051 and fight the aliens.Dan joins the force, trying to alter a deadly future just so that he can insure his family in the present.The Tomorrow War utilises screenplay smartly to amp up the sense of crisis that jolts our species into a possible death. McKay imbues a keen reading of gender through a simple tale of good vs evil. The world of aliens is relentless, savage, and most importantly, hungry. Humans fall prey (literally) to their ever-growing numbers. Yet, there is an entire sequence that elaborates how protective the men are of their female counterparts, and how they would sacrifice themselves to keep them safe. That is not to say the females are in any way timid, in fact, as the film shows, the breeding female is the fiercest of the entire lot.This sequence is juxtaposed with Dan and his future daughter, who complains that her father abandoned the family and never found the time to accommodate them anymore. But as much as he would like to imagine the scenario, Dan fails to understand how he could ever do that.McKay places aliens as the external unified force to highlight the fragmented state of the human species. Even though audiences may predict a happy ending, the route taken by the creators is compelling; almost like witnessing an inter-species race to the end.Breanna Adams and Jennifer Alavez (visual effects) create a worthy villain.Pratt's wide-eyed smoulder may become repetitive after a while, but his intentions are well-rounded. As Dan, he puts up an earnest front of a man desperately trying to hold on to everything he believes in, his family, and his need to ""be greater than a high school Biology teacher.""The film not only questions man's superiority as a race but also makes space for a happy resolution to ensure goodwill and sense of hope. The Tomorrow War is a worthy watch, just so long as we can avoid its mushy moments which may pass off as corny at times.",The Tomorrow War

Chris McKay demonstrates all of his undeniable talent behind the camera, delivering brilliantly directed action scenes featuring excellent camera work, a chill-inducing score, and exceptional VFX - the Whitespikes look stunningly scary. Zach Dean doesn't avoid the formulas and cliches of the genre, offering a generic story with no real surprises but still possessing remarkable character work. Chris Pratt is great as the protagonist, but Yvonne Strahovski is on a whole other level, delivering one of her best performances ever in a feature film. With an overextended runtime, the last act is mostly unnecessary and less exciting, ultimately making the ending a tad underwhelming compared to the epic conclusion of the second act.

90,SoumikBanerjee25,Is it Fun? Yes. Is it Entertaining? Yes. Anything More? Unfortunately No.,5,6 July 2021,"The same old concept of Alien Invasion with a tiny bit of tweaking around the corners; The Tomorrow War adds nothing new to the genre. Being a Sci-Fi entertainer; it sure holds up strong when it comes to the visual extravaganza, respectable humor, and nail-biting sequences of pure adrenaline rush. But what about the rest? They just don't fit in! As simple as that.Let me get this straight, it is not a terrible film by any means. On the contrary, it remarkably outperforms in certain aspects. Whether it be meticulous Alien Illustrations, stunning Visual Effects, Precisely positioned Sound designing, or anything that is associated to some degree with its technical way of looking at things.My main contention however is how the script decides to go over this ostentatious subject matter! The Screenplay is tenaciously elongated aside from lacking in adequate elaboration. I could overlook some of the nonsensical and plain ridiculous stuff; all thanks to the traditional suspension of disbelief but I can not tolerate such helter-skelter of a Writing. Characters just don't go that extra mile!I'm sorry to add to your woes but I have serious qualms about Chris Pratt being the lead protagonist over here. In typical scenarios, he's good enough with his usual charm and witty demeanor but whenever there's a particular scene that compels him to be emotionally unguarded or I would rather use the term 'vulnerable'; Despite his best efforts, Chris was unable to emote the wide range of expressions that are necessary for those circumstances. Any other seasoned actor would have done a whole lot better I guess.Moreover, there exists this heartwarming correlation of a Father-daughter duo with the addition of an estranged yet rejuvenating alliance betwixt an elderly Father and his Son. Hypothetically, both the relationship should have worked on the grounds of emotional growth; Unfortunately, we never got to experience the same. The reason being, uninspired & benighted scripting.Everywhere It's been touted as this brand new Sci-Fi Blockbuster, and I genuinely have no problems with that. It definitely provides value in that specific regard. It may as well be fun for casual or comparatively younger viewers. Not for us though; who have already seen the same tropes hundreds of times.",The Tomorrow War

Ready for a fun summer blockbuster? Yep, me too! Well, here it is, just in time for Independence Day here in the USA. Is it perfect? Nope. Is it fun to watch? Yep!In The Tomorrow War, the world is stunned when a group of time travelers arrives from the year 2051 to deliver an urgent message: Thirty years in the future mankind is losing a global war against a deadly alien species. The only hope for survival is for soldiers and civilians from the present to be transported to the future and join the fight. Among those recruited is a high school teacher and family man Dan Forester (Chris Pratt). Determined to save the world for his young daughter, Dan teams up with a brilliant scientist (Yvonne Strahovski) and his estranged father (J. K. Simmons) in a desperate quest to rewrite the fate of the planet.The film was written by Zach Dean and directed by Chris McKay.THINGS I LIKED:
I adore Chris Pratt. Who doesn't? Fans will get to see a shirtless, buff Pratt, complete with his six-pack abs and snarky sense of humor. This is his first time working as an executive producer too. Did you know that Arnold Schwarzenegger is his new father-in-law? The story goes that Arnold wanted to say, ""I will be back"" instead of ""I'll be back"" in his The Terminator movies because he thought it would sound more robotic like a Terminator would talk. In this movie, Chris Pratt's character gets to say, ""I will be back.""
This is Sam Richardson's second movie to come out in as many months this year! Good for him! His June release was the comedy-horror flick WEREWOLVES WITHIN. Be sure to check out my movie review for that one! Unfortunately, his character appears, disappears, and reappears randomly throughout the film.Fun fact: Some of the names that were suggested for the film were ""Generation Alien"", ""World War A"", ""Generation Gone"", ""Generation Draft"", ""Alien Dawn"", ""Destiny War"", and ""Saving Tomorrow."" Out of all those, I'm glad they picked ""The Tomorrow War"". Love it!There's a lot of humor.Betty Gilpin most recently starred in a brutally dark comedy called THE HUNT. She's extremely capable, so I was disappointed with how underutilized she was.Jasmine Mathews makes for a fierce leader.Mary Lynn Rajskub always makes me laugh. It was great to see her again.The binocular action shot was creative. I also love aerial shots.Lots of fun tension and the soundtrack really enhances the moments. There is a lot of action and fun to be had.Super creative and vicious aliens. In fact, some of the most creative ones I've seen in a while, and you get a good look at them up, close, and personal. The CGI is really great and believable.I love that regular people get drafted into the war. It's not a battle of trained soldiers versus aliens. Instead, normal men and women get sent to the future.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
Lots of exposition in the beginning and during the science scenes.Some viewers are saying the aliens represent global warming and other threats to the environment. What do YOU think? Is that what the writer and director were trying to say?You would think they'd have better weapons in the future.Despite the length of the movie, there just isn't enough time to really get to know a lot of the characters. It's a really long movie.There are some scenes that aren't explained very well. I don't want to give you any spoilers. Just trust me, but also, don't worry about the logic. Just enjoy the fun ride.Acts 1, 2, and 3 definitely feel differently from one another.It fell short of the emotional beats I was looking for and I never got teary-eyed.TIPS FOR PARENTS:
Kids will learn some science from science teacher Chris Pratt. He tells his students, ""I know, you're speechless because it's so captivating.""
Lots of profanity, including an F-bomb. In fact, there's a scene where one of the characters yells the ""Sh"" word a hundred times in 10 seconds.High body count with bloody, gory deaths of humans and aliens.Lots of destruction.People in perilous situations.You can see the rest of my review on my Movie Review Mom YouTube channel!",The Tomorrow War

100,bheadher,A whole lot of CGI and a whole lot of action...,5,2 July 2021,"...but that is the problem, this movie doesn't make a whole lot of sense right from the start...The premise is ok, but the lead up to the action is sorely lacking. Hundreds of people are recruited to fight an alien war in the future, but only one in ten have any military experience at all...do you follow where I'm going here? The plot seems to revolve around sending sheep to the slaughter, in the vain attempt to save the world. It just doesn't make sense, and then becomes a mish mash of action and CGI to try and make up for the lack of story.Sorry, but I am not impressed with this one, and I do love watching Chris Pratt's dumbfounded looks everytime...",The Tomorrow War
101,mjsreg,Dumb story but an easy watch - if far too long.,5,4 July 2021,You can figure it out - small band of 'heroes' saves the world. But the journey to get there is sometimes ridiculously stupid and totally illogical.The acting and production are great - which is the only reason I watched this to the end.It will be an ok watch with a group of friends for a night in provided you have n expectations.,The Tomorrow War
102,lareval,Enjoyable,7,18 September 2021,A good entertainment that knows exactly what it is and doesn't lie to its audience. A brainless movie that actually works. Worth a watch.,The Tomorrow War
103,danielmanson,Enjoyable film,8,18 July 2021,"Not gonna lie, I really enjoyed this one. I was seeing very mixed reviews, but seeing it advertised on ufc every 5 sodding minutes I came to peer pressure and gave it a go. And I'm glad I did, it's a really enjoyable, fun film.So just a quick rundown on what's good about it. The CGI was absolutely fantastic, considering there is a lot of it, it's done amazingly well and I recommend off that alone. The characters were done really well also, had great arcs and they all had their little quirks and were likeable people. It's just a story that makes you want more, I was sat on the edge of my seat wondering what's going to happen next. Does he survive? Does he not? And finally, it's just fun. It's a fun action sci-fi movie with a lot of guns, explosions and more action.So I'm seeing a lot complain about the plot and there are some I agree with and some I don't. Listen, I'm not going to go into details because I don't want spoilers, but I personally don't think there's anything too wrong with the time travel plot (or enough for you to consider this a bad film off that alone). It's relatively straight forward to understand and not confusing.SLIGHT SPOILER. Avoid this short paragraph if you want no hints on plot. I just had to mention this. Why dedicate a portion of the film and make out like this toxin is the thing that saves the world, yet they use it on about 5 of them in the end. Could have done that a bit better!!But yeah, there's not much else to say. For films financed by a streaming sites I would go as far as saying this is one of the better ones out there by far. Considering Netflix is throwing crap out like Army of the Dead (can confirm this film is much better than that one). So yeah, I recommend this film!! 8/10.",The Tomorrow War
104,PyroSikTh,You Get What You Pay For,6,7 July 2021,"The Tomorrow War is a dumb action blockbuster, and that's exactly how it should be approached. The plot makes no sense and is full of holes, it's way too long for a single movie of this calibre and should've just saved the last forty-five minutes for the inevitable sequel, and it reeks of being a bad Nolan imitation in multiple ways. But goddamn was this movie fun to watch. The action is big and bombastic with build-ups full of tension, and exquisite CGI and creature design offering us genuinely horrific aliens. The jokes are well-placed and amusing enough, and the acting was a level or two above what you'd expect from a movie like this. If they made a sequel, I'd probably watch it. I give The Tomorrow War an above average 6/10; you get what you pay for.",The Tomorrow War
105,jordan2240,One of the better creature features,8,24 July 2021,"Very much enjoyed this movie. The creature effects were excellent, and there was never a dull moment. Yeah, it's a bit ridiculous, but it's a story about aliens fighting humans, so you'd expect that. Loved the setting of the ending conflict. Sam Richardson's character was particularly enjoyable. Would have been a lot of fun in the theater.",The Tomorrow War
106,ebeckstr-1,6 would be a bit too generous,5,4 July 2021,"The mediocre reviews are accurate. I tried not to examine the script very closely and just watch this as escapist entertainment. Doing so was very difficult. We know from movies like Edge of Tomorrow that excellent time travel / alien invasion movies can be delivered with a good script, so there's really no excuse for a movie to burn through 140 minutes with practically nothing to show for it with respect to character development or story. On the other hand, if you're looking for a way to spend some time with a movie that you don't have to pay a lot of attention to or something that you just want to wash over you then you could do worse.",The Tomorrow War

108,Dragonborn64,Too Sappy,5,2 October 2021,Chris Pratt strutting around with no shirt giving for God and country speeches is grating.

111,pfgpowell-1,Completely pointless piece of rubbish.,3,29 July 2021,"If you decide to watch this, you'll watch one of the silliest films made since Adam and Eve. If you have watched this, you'll know exactly what I mean.I little background is necessary: in the year 2022 the world is made aware that 30 years in the future aliens have invaded Earth and in the defensive war Earth is losing. So folk from the future come back in time to recruit more soldiers.Everyone - around the world - is drafted (though as this is a Yank film for mainly a Yank audience the action takes place solely in Yankee land) and - somehow - taken to the future for a seven-day tour of duty. Most can expect to die. They get no training whatsoever. And we are expected to take this seriously.The point is that the best CGI, rousing noisy score or pseudo-drama can rescue rubbish like this. Who are the aliens, who come a time travel has become popular? So many questions are posed which could have made a more interesting film yet we are fobbed off with this shooting fest.If you haven't seen it, don't.

112,stevenrotherforth,And there's me thinking that Paramount was trying to hide a turkey,7,4 July 2021,"The Tomorrow WarMovie 7.5/10Big budget mayhem comes to the small screen courtesy of Amazon Prime. Some may say that this is an 'Edge Of Tomorrow' clone but still this is a mightily enjoyable bit of Friday night movie fun.Chris Pratt gets sent thirty years into the future to help fight a war we are losing to some rather impressively rendered CGI aliens. This movie screams big budget! With $200 million at hand every action scene oozes with computer generated sparkle.'The Tomorrow War' is somewhat of a pleasant surprise. There's hardly been any marketing or buzz for this movie. Almost as if Paramount were trying to hide a turkey and then palm it off on to Amazon. Thankfully this is not the case and we are treated to a slightly overlong Sci-Fi epic. I say slightly overlong, I do feel at least twenty minutes could have been shaved off this movies runtime. If this movie had got its own theatrical release it probably would have been made to go on a diet.There's definitely comparisons to be made to other Sci-Fi Classics here. The aforementioned 'Edge Of Tomorrow', 'The Terminator' and 'Aliens' all spring to mind. Still 'The Tomorrow War' does enough to carve out its own identity. This mainly down to a great supporting cast. The likes of JK Simmons steals the show in his brief cameo and Betty Gilpin is under-utilised but a welcome addition to the cast.There's a possible franchise on offer here. I would watch the charismatic Chris Pratt and co all go toe to toe again with a bunch of aliens. The beasts themselves are also a refreshing change compared to the generic extraterrestrials we usually get. They look superb and are truly frightening.Picture quality 8.5/10Available on Amazon Prime in stunning 4K HDR this movie is a treat for AV enthusiasts. Colours pop with muzzle flash and explosions being squintingly bright. Sunsets and horizons are very cinematic making your TV look like the silver screen down at your local multiplex. Detail and CGI are expertly rendered. Some of the best creature effects I've seen in a while come to life.Skin texture and clothing are razor sharp with a grain free digital image. A feast for the eyes as long as your Internet connection can keep up.Sound quality 8.5/10Like the image quality, audio is also very impressive.Thank you Amazon!Finally offering a Dolby Atmos sound mix to accompany the onscreen action. And what an Atmos mix it is! Low frequency effects are ballistic. Machine gun fire will rattle your fillings loose. Explosions have that subterranean punch rumbling your floorboards and upsetting the neighbours in the process. Atmos effects are constant and easily identifiable. A particular scene where a chopper flys overhead was great.That said there's many standout audible delights. Surround effects hug and squeeze you. Centre channel information is always clear. Dialogue is never lost under musical score or action effects. This is one fantastic Home Theatre experience.Final thoughts'The Tomorrow War' is a surprisingly good movie.

I honestly almost passed this movie up, the cover was not appealing, then I saw a trailer and had to see this.I absolutely love Sam Richardson, and just saw him in Werewolf Within. He is shaping up to be my favorite comedian, although everyone got a least one laugh out of me in this movie. Was this movie a bit far fetched, yes!

121,President_George_Washington,FROM THE DESK OF GEORGE WASHINGTON,1,14 July 2021,"Good Morrow.Well, if you have the ability to over-look massive plot holes and a general silliness of the whole affair, you might find yourself entertained. If you think this is a ""10 Star"" movie, you are either a paid shill, a bot, or an adolescent gamer.Nothing in this loud junk makes sense...scene after scene of one-dimensional characters who just drop exposition and you'll still find yourself baffled at how utterly dumb the whole thing is.What we learn is that in 30 years some alien creatures are basically eating all the humans; they're fast, lethal, are super-great swimmers. We learn that there aren't enough battle-ready humans in the future to fight the threat.The solution: since there is some sort of time-travel device, is to send old, out of shape, untrained idiots into the future with lousy weapons (that have never-ending bullets - that's cheat mode for you gamers). These unlucky citizens are told nothing about the aliens, not how to fight them, what kills them. Nothing. Instead, they're told that they will most likely die. Nice. This is followed by the group being transported into the future...and at the other end, just dropped from the sky - killing most of the recruits on impact - the survivors land in a rooftop swimming pool (all in the deep end I guess).Um, okay...however, we've already seen the future people enter our time during a soccer match, all gently landing and walking out of bright disco lights.To point out each dummy moment is pointless. The high school kid who loves volcanos and easily solves a key problem was so corny....and of course, our hero ends the movie saving his marriage, reconnecting with his Dad and has a hand-to hand combat with the Queen alien in modern day Russia.I don't mind a mindless film or suspending disbelief for the sake of a good tale, but this film asks too much.I can't recommend this.Cheers.",The Tomorrow War
122,daisukereds,Good enough to watch,7,4 July 2021,"The script of this movie is VERY contrived.Meaning that while watching it, it is almost IMPOSSIBLE to not get taken out of it due to how deliberately ""created"" it is, instead of being more natural in it's development. The premise is very interesting! But the way it's used is.. rather simplistic.And while it also feels like you've seen parts of it already.. it is very well done, tense and entertaining for what it is. It has good cast, no annoying characters, science-stuff, decent set-pieces and even sentimental moments that are earned.I liked the threat's design, and the movie is much more colorful than expected (from what I saw in the trailer).Decent watch for a Friday night.",The Tomorrow War

124,DeBBss,You'll get a little more than just action,6,2 July 2021,"The Tomorrow War has a lot of common issues that you see in movies of this genre. It's action packed and entertaining, but filled with cliches and predictable moments. The plot also ends up being paper thin if you start critically thinking about it. That's why if you're going to watch this movie, you have to turn your brain off, because there are a lot of plot holes.And even though the story is cliched and has as many holes as swiss cheese, it's surprisingly emotional. I originally thought that this movie would be pure action, and it certainly delivers on that action, but there are scenes in this film that develop the story and characters on an emotional level. And even though this movie is 2hr20min long, it doesn't feel nearly that long, it honestly flies by.The CGI is also very good. You can tell that a large part of the budget and development time was spent on the CGI, it's seriously that good. The alien designs were also great; they were made to look frightening and intimidating, and they succeeded on that.The Tomorrow War is a movie made for entertainment, and maybe pull on the heartstrings a little. Overall, I found the movie to be quite enjoyable. It's decently acted, it has great CGI, intense action scenes, and sprinkled in with some cliches and plot holes. Right now, it's the best thing on Prime Video, so I'd definitely give it a recommendation.",The Tomorrow War

12A
Director: Chris McKay
Starring: Chris Pratt, Yvonne Strahovski, JK Simmons, Betty Gilpin, Sam Richardson, Jasmine Mathews, Edwin Hodge etcThe World is stunned when a group of time travellers arrive from the year 2051 to deliver an urgent message: Thirty years in the future, mankind is losing a global war against a deadly alien species. This film was very mediocre, and the definition of a stupid, dumb, and fun blockbuster.My first few positives would be the fantastic cinematography, the chemistry between the cast. A fun set up, the characters were established well, as well as some interesting worldbuilding elements and character conflict. This movie visually was fantastic, it had a high budget, and it was used effectively, the film truly popped visually with realistic looking action scenes, amazing use of colour, and some creative shots involving the aliens that built tension well and the scope of the film was tremendous. I also liked the chemistry between the cast. The connection between Chris Pratt, Betty Gilpin and Ryan Armstrong was charming and believable making you connect with there characters very easily, and Chris Pratt is the kind of actor who has great chemistry with whoever he works with, and this was no different. He had great chemistry with the whole cast, and they all worked really well together. I thought the set up and establishing of the characters was excellent, the film did a good job at building the characters up, establishing their lives, and how they are as people. Making it seem like a normal day to setting and life for all the characters, so the set up of the time travellers was a lot of fun. Having a big get together to watch the football felt normal, and to have people from the future suddenly appear on the pitch was a fun surprise and a clever way to set up the main plot points. I thought the film had some interesting worldbuilding moments that they set up with the rules of the story world and how to go into the future. These weren't executed well (more of this shortly) but they at least set up a lot of interesting things on the different processes into how they travel into the future and how long they can be there for. With an interesting and fascinating selection process where they had to be dead before 2051 in order to be chosen which was interesting and set up some development for the main character, and the conflict that went with this as so many people didn't come back alive and contemplating whether the characters should even be trying was also handled well and in a decent amount of detail.My first few negatives would be the rushed pacing, lack of explanation to plot points. The extreme amount of plot holes, as well as the forced humour and use of exposition. This film's pacing and structure was an absolute mess. It rushed through everything that shouldn't have been rushed. Jumping from one scene to the next without an ounce of thought into developing the scenes. There was also a complete lack of explanation to so many scenes. It was a bunch of set up ideas that were never developed or explained properly the film just expected you to keep up. It was confusing and muddled, they rushed explanations into the process of teleporting and how it all worked and was messily written. There were also countless plot holes, there was so many plot points that either weren't explained or even mentioned when it was obvious that it needed to be developed. Or just plot points that were introduced and then never talked about again or changed as the movie went on. There were also parts that simply didn't make sense and logically even for a film like this felt out of place. The script was also very poor. The humour was very forced and clunky, the jokes never landed and were honestly awkward to watch. The film also completely overelied on exposition. Completely relying on spoon feeding and long unneeded moments of dialogue to explain everything instead of through the action of the film which would have made it more enjoyable and still achieved the same thing.My final few positives would be the performances, great character motivation and depth. The great development to the plot, plot twists and emotional weight. As well as the fun final act. Chris Pratt delivered a great performance here; he is great lead role material. He delivered as expected with the action scenes, as well as having loads of charm and charisma, whilst also delivering in the more emotional and personal scenes as well which was a nice surprise. The performance from Yvonne Strahovski was also very strong here, she had excellent chemistry with Chris Pratt and showed and gave a lot of emotional depth to her character. I also really liked the motivation for a lot of the characters and why they wanted to fight, in particular with the character of Dorian (Edwin Hodge) who I thought was a very interesting character and his reasoning for fighting multiple times due to his battle with cancer and not wanting to be stuck living the rest of his days doing nothing was interesting. I also really liked the character depth and emotional weight to the film. I really liked the relationship between Dan and Muri as well as his relationship with his father. Having his father abandon him as a young child and him not having a father figure in his life really impacted his character and his relationship with his daughter. So, having the colonel in the future be the older version of his daughter was a really interesting element to the film. And learning that he left his wife and daughter in the future added a lot of depth and emotion to there characters as their relationship developed. I also loved the development to the plot and the plot twists. The part of the film that I am classing as the final act was great. It developed and built tension excellently as the threat of the aliens increased. I thought the twists involving where the aliens were situated in the present as well as the increased stakes of Dan bringing back a cure to stop the future war from happening was an unexpected twist to the film that definitely made it more interesting in parts. Plus, the final action set piece was fantastic and thrilling.My final few negatives would be the tonal imbalances, odd character decisions. Poor dialogue. And the messy and unneeded final act and ending. This film didn't know what tone it wanted to go for. At first it was a sci fi drama. And then it morphed into an action/disaster film and it tried to add too much. It felt tonally unfocused and it really didn't work for me. I liked it at its best as an action/ disaster film with hints of horror. I thought the film also had odd character decisions. The film made it really hard to tell who to support in places. Characters either made harsh decisions, or where incredibly dumb just for the sake of an extended action scene that didn't need it. The dialogue here was also poor and held the film back from the depth that it could have had with its characters. Generic and corny lines, awkward and clunky conversations. It was just often very robotic or too by the books and it really showed the films weaknesses with its writing. One of my biggest issues with the film has to be the ending. The film should have ended with the last big action piece and Dan getting back to present day and end on the twist of the location of the aliens. Instead, the film kept going and going. It felt like another half of a film and a completely different film compared to all of the other acts. It was sloppy, poorly written, and unneeded. What baffles me is that they plan to do a sequel which I really don't understand how considering they wrapped everything up with this film.Overall, The Tomorrow War is admittedly very entertaining and fun in places, and if you switch your brain off you can have a good time with it. Plus, Chris Pratt is a great lead actor. But the film was so poorly written it couldn't fully justify or explain its complex plot. Leading to a messy, poorly structured train wreck that ended on a sour note.Overall rating 48/100.",The Tomorrow War
126,jwscott-home,As Great a SciFi Movie As You Will See,8,5 July 2021,"Anybody who's rated this less than a 7, simply doesn't like SciFi, Action and Adventure.. and that's OK. But for those of who do and realize just how few good SF movies there are, we know this is one awesome blockbuster! It's got everything you want in a SF movie. It's full of action, it has the intensity, the fear, the apprehension and the concept that gets you to think about what if. I absolutely loved it it. I love SciFi movies but 75% disappoint for sure. I also love movies such as War and Peace, Anna Kareina and Amiele... the point being I'm a movie lover. I'm candid on my reviews and ratings. I don't follow the critics, I follow one rule to critique a movie... Did I enjoy myself? And yes I certainly did. I'm a huge fan of Strahovski.. she finally got her shot at a big movie. When I reviewed the series 'Chuck' yrs ago, I said then she'll make it to the big screen and I'm glad she did. She'll have her choice going forward at a dramatic role that will win her an Academy Award. She's that good. But every actress has to have a blockbuster first it seems and this is hers. Back to the flick... it's certainly non stop action and you don't want to take a pee break because your afraid you'll miss something. And cudos to Amazon for finally having a real blockbuster movie. I know the narrow minded artsy fartsys who have no real ability to rate movies favorably that aren't Dramas, but this was FUN and I had a great time! As did my family with ages from 16 to 21 to 57 and 60! Great flick and a must watch unless your a prude who only likes the classics.Pratt played the great hero as usual and something about this guy but I enjoy his movies. Let your common sense go and just enjoy this for what it is.. a big expensive popcorn flick with action, a bit of plot and lotsa fun!",The Tomorrow War

Remember though, tomorrow never comes.",3,21 July 2021,"This is a movie with the potential to be interesting, but basically it is sooooooo incredibly stuuuuuuupid, that it makes no sense.The plot is pretty simple. People from the future come back to recruit people who would be dead by the time aliens invade in the future to fight in the future war. Of course they don't train them, give them weapons that would be sufficient to be effective or even bother with things like providing them information. So of course 75% of them die horrible deaths right away.Okay, so that is stupid, but it just gets dumber and dumber and dumber as it progresses.Even worse, Chris Pratt is stretching it a little in his role, but maybe that isn't his fault, as no other actor really shines either.Put this movie in your list to watch tomorrow, but remember, tomorrow never comes.",The Tomorrow War

I decided to take a chance on this one cuz I love me some sci fi. I am glad I did.The movie is not special so if you go into like I did with lower expectations you will probably really enjoy it. The acting is great, not sure why some were hating on Pratt for his role in this. The CGI was top notch, I was expecting made for tv level but everything looked fairly smooth for the most part.The story was a little meh. Time travel is a tricky plot line is rarely done well so I usually end up hating. I didn't hate this plot but the writing got thin in places and it was hard to stay in the movie without asking things like why don't they use time travel to do this or that instead. But overall it all worked as long as you don't expect anything to deep, wanna see aliens get shot up and people get ripped apart and beat down with some slposions mixed in then I would recommend this one.",The Tomorrow War

I had to turn it way up to hear adequately but within seconds the sound jumped too high, blasting my eardrums & giving me a heart attack. I had to keep fiddling with the volume knob turning it up & down.There are scenes of someone on a cell phone outside & you're supposed to hear both people talking but the sound is so low I could barely hear either one of them & had to turn the volume up really high. Then the person hangs up & walks into the house & the volume suddenly BLARED really loud & I had to turn it way down. There was a scene of a couple talking to each other in the bedroom & I couldn't hear them unless I turned the sound up really high. A few seconds later one of them get up & walks from the bedroom into the living room & the sound BLARED, hurting my ear drums & scaring me half to death. I was constantly fiddling with the volume.

Tells of alien invaders in the future practically wiped out humanity. They travel back in time to draft people from the past to fight in the war and preserve the Human Race. This is by no means a good movie there are so many subpar things about this movie, what's good about the movie is Chris Pratt well not his best role is primarily the only one you care about. He plays of the role very well even feel the chemistry between him and his daughter at the beginning of the film as genuine. It feels like he has something to actually lose apart from him no one else is interesting what you barely remember them or their naps this is one guy he's basically ""comic relief "" and there's this one guy who been who is done three tours already to the future he seemed a decent character but he disappears for a good portion of the movie. You barely get to know any of these people who get sent with Chris. The visuals while CG are good enough to draw your attention . The explosion and gunfire as well but probably the best thing in the movie is the monsters which actually have kind of a unique design to them in an interesting way of fighting that comes as a surprise that you're not really giving detail about the alien until you actually see them. Knows it makes you wonder how is the human race even still around given that these people are launched directly into the future. Most of them don't have any training whatsoever there's like no structure whatsoever is essentially throwing them into a meat grinder. The ending of the film is also rather botched there's a certain point where you see that this would be the best part stop the movie , but by that point there's still about 30 minutes left it just drags on to unnecessary pattern*Spoilers* The biggest part where the movie tries to manipulate you when Dan tries to save his daughters life. It comes off as empty because it out right nullified when he returns to the past with The toxin and doing so basically makes it so that future doesn't happen. The other problem as well speaking of primarily have to do it the movie continuing after he returns to the future. It could've ended with him just giving the toxin to the tented and they made more but no you have to get closure with characters that had like one scene such as Dan's father and a student in his class that you've honestly probably forgot about.",The Tomorrow War

The cinematography is not bad, the directing is solid and the film is easy to watch. It's a shame that directors rely too much on CGI and too little on practical effects, but we're unfortunately used to that.What the film lacks is an R rating, because PG-13 films simply always seem inferior when it comes to action. But even with that shortcoming, the film is interesting and worth watching.The cast is excellent, Chris Pratt is an excellent choice for the role of Dan Forester. The actors did their best and portrayed the characters well and made the film even more fun.The film wants to entertain the viewer and succeeds at it.The concept is interesting and works well, aliens, time travel, the struggle for survival and the main character who fights for his family.A surprisingly entertaining and interesting film that is definitely worth watching.",The Tomorrow War

Everything else, outside USA, may exist, if needed (here: Russia); otherwise not. The movie plot has a fairly interesting plot idea (although not new) ruined by cliches and banalities, cheesy acting and dialogues, bad writing and heroic musical score. Almost as made by Disney. Now, I know that actors have to pay their bills and all, even in the times of pandemic, but no one needed this really, even for that. Recommended only to seriously intoxicated rednecks and alike.

These travelers demand present day Earth to help fight this war by conscripting them and sending them into 2050. Each conscript will be there for only 7-days and return to Earth. Dan Forester (Chris Pratt) is drafted and he meets his adult daughter Mary (Yvonne Strahovski) now a Colonel in the Army and she is working on a Toxin that will kill all the Aliens.The Aliens are quite scary and the CGI is simply more than fantastic. Kudos. You will swear the Aliens are very real. There are many touching parts having to do with Dan and his family, his 9-year old daughter Mary (Ryan Kira Armstrong) and later his adult daughter in 2050.We will see Dan's time in 2050 with his daughter and we will also see many battles with the Aliens. As you watch I am sure you will ask yourself: can this really happen here. Hmmmm...........probably.Notables: Sam Richardson as Charlie, who Dan meets in 2050; J. K. Simmons as James, Dan's estranged father; Edwin Hodge as Dorian, Dan's student who knows all about Volcanoes; Mary Lynn Rajskub as Nora who knew Colonel Mary Forester by sending conscripts to 2050 and later helps Dan when he is back in the present time.This movie is found - at this time - on Amazon Prime Video, but I did see a note that it is also a TV series with the same title. Have no idea what channel it's on. Had no idea that it is a TV series. Don't know when this movie will hit the Red Boxes in many 7-11s and large grocery stores.The CGI and cinematography are spell binding and the action battle scenes are very good. You will see that the Aliens are quite hard to kill.Be Warned: Young children may not be suitable to watch the Aliens as they are quite scary looking and even I had to avert my eyes at times. Hope I don't have dreams about them.Yes, this is quite scary and also touching, and over all very enjoyable.

Blockbuster budget, bargain bin movie",4,5 July 2021,"From the director of ""The Lego Batman Movie"" & the writer of...... well, nothing really, we have ""The Tomorrow War"" a 2 hour+ movie, with a production budget of $200 million, plenty of decent actors. Some decent cgi monsters & mindless action at breathtaking speed, sadly it also has one of the dullest & silliest story's / plots in recent years.This is very much like a TV movie with an absolutely obscene budget, the scenes between the action are dull & for the most part very boring, any momentum built up during the action scenes quickly fall away, for the most part most of the scenes are silly & pointless & any logic in the story dissapears very quickly, the year is 2051, the creatures appeared 1st on Russian soil 2047, the world population by then would be roughly 9.7 billion, according to the story these monsters wiped out 9 billion people in 3 years but were struggling to kill the remaining 500,000 over a period of 12 months, it's sloppy writing & silly logic that make stories /plots like this difficult to enjoy, stuff like time travel is just a plot device so it's always best to just glaze over that bit but the fact the daughter is still alive & she's the commander of the remaining military & that she is capable of superhuman like physical ability while dozens of other soldiers are batted around like pins & she's also the lead scientist is just pushing the suspension of belief way way too far.Sadly another movie that is more style over substance.It's worth a watch if you can manage not to nod off from how dull the non action scenes are.This may have had a blockbuster budget but it falls short of what a real blockbuster movie should be.",The Tomorrow War
144,TheVictoriousV,"Generic, derivative, illogical; the most ""Hollywood"" film I've seen in a while",3,27 July 2021,"The Tomorrow War is reportedly the latest in a long line of sci-fi war films that wish to emulate Starship Troopers without getting the point of it (the lampooning of American jingoism, the clearly parodical fascism, the biting satire of the military, et cetera). More offensive than that, in my opinion, is the film's maddening time travel rules.It's also one of the most derivative big-studio sci-fi releases since 2017's Life. I recommend Fireball cinnamon liquor if you plan to take a shot every time you're reminded of a different, better movie while watching this one. Some of it wants to be like the Alien franchise, some of it wants to be Interstellar, much of it probably wishes it was Primer or Netflix's Dark. There is also a preachy twist regarding the alien race of ""Whitespikes"" that made me think of The Day After Tomorrow with a dash of Birdemic: Shock and Terror.The idea itself is unusual, involving a war that hasn't happened yet, so poorly manned that draftees must be summoned from the past. Christy Lemire describes the plot thusly: ""Human visitors from the year 2051 have traveled back in time to the present day to warn us that an alien invasion has besieged Earth, and civilians must leap ahead three decades to help fight them."" Whatever questions you might have just from reading this blurb, they won't be your last.One of the warriors sent into the future is stock Hollywood hero Dan Forester (Chris Pratt), whose commanding officer becomes his now-adult daughter, played by Ryan Kiera Armstrong in the present and Yvonne Strahovski in the future. The fact that the colonel is Forester's daughter all grown up is apparently supposed to be something of a surprise. It isn't.Something goes awry when Forester enters the war-ridden future for the first time, as his transporting device places him and the others high up in the sky, causing them to plummet uncontrollably toward the city. The main character, of course, wears Hollywood-hero plot armor in addition to his standard combat gear, and so survives the half-a-kilometer drop because there happened to be a shallow swimming pool (phew) underneath him alone. More typical than that is the shoehorned exposition about his past, often delivered in supposedly heartfelt scenes between him and his wife (Betty Gilpin), and the similarly clumsy exposition about the war itself.There is some fun to be had when we get to the non-stop violence and green-ish bloodshed of the later scenes. Is it worth the long wait? Perhaps not, but the film is available on Amazon Prime Video, so it is very easy to skip ahead to this part. The visual effects during these scenes are a bit shoddy, though not as inexcusable as those of Black Widow.It probably isn't a spoiler to anyone if I point out that the futuristic war against the Whitespikes is ultimately prevented, ergo Dan's daughter never grows up to become the military leader that helps him prevent it (just go with it). It's all pretty standard Hollywood background noise, albeit an example where thinking about the plot for even a second is a fool's errand. Look up from your phone only if J. K. Simmons is on-screen.Pratt himself is charming enough -- as is always the case, even when he dials back the endearing goofiness of, say, his Star-lord and Emmet characters. This is fortunate since the side characters are so dreadfully bland that I forgot they existed.The villainous aliens aren't especially interesting either. They, too, seem lifted from previous works, or at least like they're the descendants of the Cloverfield monster and the queen from Independence Day 2. We also learn that they may be pawns to someone greater (Sequels, anyone?), à la the Urzahs from After Earth. Thus we end the review on a hopeful note: in our progressive day and age, even the terrible movies get to be ripped off.",The Tomorrow War
145,jackgdemoss,The plot and logic devolve rapidly throughout the runtime,7,19 July 2021,"The Tomorrow War opens strong with fast paced world building and clean exposition. After 25 minutes I understood the stakes and the objective and had a sense of potent intrigue. The mission begins abruptly with a gruesome start which hooked me even harder. Even the first 10 minutes of action is fantastic, building the monsters up as this mysterious and lethal force. From the 40 minute mark and on, the intrigue and plot lose their merit. The biggest problem the film has is how often it asks the audience to make huge logical leaps. The characters have the only thing stronger than plot armor: bad writing armor. It genuinely feels like they had a writer or a producer fall off halfway through filming because it goes from intense dystopian horror action to B-movie scifi laughs near the end. All of this said, I was still focused on the movie the whole time and had a great time. I am hoping that Chris Pratt's subpar performance on the back half of the movie was mostly due to bad writing, so I will be sure to give him a few more chances in his action adventures.",The Tomorrow War
146,danybur,A tomorrow that is today,7,13 July 2021,"Summary:Great display and entertainment in this war pre-apocalyptic film with time travel, some interesting ideas that it does not fully exploit, several references to previous films of the genre and the eternal axis placed in the family nucleus.Review.In the year 2052, humanity fights an unequal and desperate battle against voracious alien invaders. Through a time window that is established with 2022, platoons are sent from the present to participate for a certain period of time in that contest. In one of them Dan Forester (Chris Pratt) is recruited, who, after training, immediately puts himself in charge of a mission under the orders of a colonel played by Yvonne Strahovski.Yes: it is another film about time travel, warlike and pre-apocalyptic and with several references to previous films (which I will not reveal so as not to spoil). His development could be divided into three parts: the first, a look at Forester's family life, with his wife and his daughter, and some family conflict that quickly led to the recruitment and training of the protagonist; the second, the mission in the future and the third, the derivations of that mission.Regarding time travel, Chris McKay's film makes some clarifications in this regard, which, as always, are usually insufficient on this subject. In any case, it could be said that it does not fully exploit the paradoxes and even the inconsistencies that the script proposes. Like many others of its kind, it orbits in terms of the preservation or restoration of the family nucleus, with the North American obsession with the father figure at the center. One of the successes of the film is its characterization of the training period, which looks peculiar, urgent and improvised.The production is overwhelming, and the intimacy alternates with action scenes with confrontations fought on different scales and settings, from commando actions to massive battles. Alien creatures are hideous and achieve physical presence. The musicalization does not overwhelm.Pratt is an ideal actor to play a character who ""does what needs to be done"" to the best of his ability, both sensitive and determined, while Strahovski is also the one for a distant and cool high ranking scientist and military officer who knows she is playing her decisive cards. Both make up a bond that developed differently ... would have given rise to another film.",The Tomorrow War

Aspects of these creatures and even parts of the story are derived from a number of past sci-fi classics, but I must say these are some of the most frighting creatures I've seen in a while.

Feels like there's a lot of padding here, especially in the pointless family drama scenes.Secondly, the time travel aspect makes zero sense. Okay, they're sent into the future, but they come back. So why isn't anyone developing extra armor to deal with those flying spikes, or better weapons instead of low caliber assault rifles?! And nobody has grenades or bazookas?!!And of course, they have the escape helicopter as far away from the important lab facility as possible. Why wasn't anyone monitoring that female creature? The daughter Colonel Forester even says earlier in the scene that she needs hourly injections of the tranquilizer. What a lame setup for everything else that came.I also didn't understand Pratt's character's rationale for not wanting to 'leave' his daughter in the future. How stupid was he, as soon as he went back with whatever serum, and if they conquered the aliens early on, her future would have changed anyway.The ending is also dumb. The government is unwilling to help them locate the aliens in Russia under the glacier, it doesn't want to spend the money. So somehow, they're able to put together a crack team with all that gear that flies they into Russia from the US, with what MONEY?!!Then they march all the way to the glacier to inject the sleeping aliens one by one with that serum, but ultimately just end up blowing up the whole ship....which they could have done anyway! The very act of injecting the serum was pointless because it just woke them up. Which means, the whole act of even getting the serum and mass producing it, was pointless. And how did that comic relief character know where to find JK Simmons and Chris Pratt when they had taken off on their snowmobiles in a random direction to track the female creature. And wasn't he hurt, hence leaving him there?So, if you can watch this for free on Prime, good enough. I'm glad I didn't spend money at the theater to watch this mess.",The Tomorrow War

160,sirwillisiv,Average and inoffensive popcorn thriller...,6,7 July 2021,"The Tomorrow War's got a neat concept, an adequate emotional center and some decently exciting action and imagery. It doesn't get too loud and annoying and it knows when to slow down and allow the performances to sink in. I won't pretend it's a masterpiece, though. My problems: I thought the first act was a slog; bogged with exposition and the film is perhaps a little too long entirely. I can forgive a long runtime if the characters are engaging enough but they were mostly a 5 out of 10 on the interesting scale. J. K. Simmons was pretty underutilized, too. Holy crap, did he get jacked, though. Overall, nothing about The Tomorrow War warrants a second viewing and I neither recommend it or insist on avoiding it. It's your typical summer blockbuster fare. Action-packed eye candy with familiar, good-looking faces at the helm and a touch of heart to give it some levity. Harmless and entertaining. It'll surely divert action junkies for a couple of hours. I'd consider it better than anything Michael Bay and Roland Emmerich has made since it at least tries to dabble in new concepts and it knows when to not be obnoxious and take a breather. So, I'll give it that.",The Tomorrow War
161,faithless4734,I can see why.........,5,4 July 2021,"....this has under 7 rating. It has some gaps in story and sense. It also seems a bit simplistic and a bit to much like they were trying to make it feel like ""Independence day"" all over again, the saving the world kinda thing but they feel short. I can also understand why some have rated it higher as it has decent action if somewhat simplistic and over the top. I like the idea of the plot and the jump window ""rules"" if you will, however it could have been done much better. The interplay between Dorian and Dan is not all that well done and a bit cliched as is the Charlie character in general. The Col. Forester part is a bit silly, I should have expected it tho, based on the rest of the show to that point. It does NOT get better from there. Starship Troopers for dummies was a fantastically descriptive review. I mean it could not have been better described in fewer words.All that said, it is a halfway (barely) decent scifi show all things considered. Watch it and decide for yourself.",The Tomorrow War

The movie is well done and the aliens look great. Acting was good. I remember Yvonne Strahovski from Chuck (tt0934814) and she's just as sexy as then. Not a big fan of Chris Pratt, but I do enjoy his acting, weird hey. J. K. Simmons, well, he just has that screen presence that works. Other reviewers have complained about plot holes or things not making sense, it's a movie about time travel and aliens, don't over analyse it and it will be fine. Having said that, there was one point I didn't understand why Dan didn't understand the concept of time travel and changing the past. Anyway, recommended.",The Tomorrow War

Its 30 mins too long. But it's ok for for what it is, a Generic film to zone out on.Theres is a layer of wokeness in it, but to be fair it's not that obvious or in your face. Doesn't hinder the progression of the movie. Watch it for something different. If you want a classic, this isn't it.",The Tomorrow War
164,loco_73,Fun at the movies! Who knew it still exists?!,7,5 July 2021,"While ""The Tomorrow War"" doesn't re-invent the wheel or is a particularly brilliant movie, what it is, is a fun watch! Yes it is a bit long, the story drags in some parts, there are some plot holes and some characters are kind of superfluous. But the film itself is a return to the type of entertaining, popcorn blockbuster we used to enjoy during our summers, before all the politics and ideologies seeped into and infected even our entertainment. Something that is quite obvious even in some of the reviews here as well as the clear cut division between audiences and critics and their perception and reception of ""The Tomorrow War"".Chris Pratt is a fairly solid lead and delivers a reliable ""leading man"" performance. J. K. Simmons is always fun to watch and I wish there was more of him in this, because he always ups the ante in anything he appears in! Betty Gilpin and Sam Richardson were great as were the other supporting characters. Personally, I think Yvonne Strahovski had the best part in this movie in terms of acting, especially how she relates to and interacts with Chris Pratt. Their scenes anchor this movie in a wonderful way and give it a much needed emotional punch and gravitas.All in all, don't read too much into this movie and whatever ""controversy"" surrounds it. For my part as I've said, this is the type of flick you sit down at, switch your brain off, suspend your disbelief and just enjoy as a cinematic ride...just like we used to during summer...have fun at the movies! Remember that?!",The Tomorrow War

Some part was too cheese for me hence the 9 star instead of ten😅 It's been a while a sci-fi entertained me so much that I don't wanted to take a loo break🤣 I think last time it was I am Mother (that's a great movie too check it out)
So about this one; loaded with action, great visuals, interesting story, some great characters. I thought I predicted the ending, but part of it was still a surprise. Now the sequel could be about the US government collecting DNA samples and recreation the creatures as weapons. Cuz you know; humanity never learns.I haven't cried on science fiction since the T-800 melted, but I did cry for a second at some point (won't spoil it).PS Gail the snail finally did something good not just mashing junks under the table😂",The Tomorrow War

Of course, if the characters in this Sci Fi Mishap had Advanced Weaponry, they would stand a better chance of putting an end to the Tiresome and Cliche 'Alien Threat' a lot sooner. Hence, to heck with technological advancement (Liberals are slowly killing it off anyway!).Bottom line: This film was tedious to watch, insulted my intellect (This happens a lot!), and lacked any originality.

But...the overbearing sentimentality, Hallmark clichés, plot holes, and unnecessarily complicated points bore this one down. What could have been a fun and still epic 110 minute movie was instead 140, and felt like it too. That said, most of the actors did really well although I wish they had gone a grittier route with the great material and made it a more action/horror thriller with an R rating. The awesome creature designs certainly called for it. One thing that irked me is the twist at the ending, which I won't spoil; taking inspiration from other movies is one thing but that hit felt like a straight up rip-off. Oh well! Still enjoyed it. Stellar as the CGI was, would've been nice to have had some practical effects in there as well. But I guess pickers can't be choosers.",The Tomorrow War
171,grygotis,"Big, loud, stupid and poorly acted",4,10 July 2021,"I recently read in an interview with Chris Pratt that the original screenplay for this made Children of Men seem not only light, but SO much lighter that they had to work on the screenplay to make it more uplifting. I did not read the original screenplay, but if that's true this has been homogenized, pasteurized, Hollywoodized to the point that it is just another big, stupid action movie with perfect CGI, poor writing, bad jokes, boring acting with an ending predictable from the very beginning, though perhaps even more cringeworthy than imagined. I will say it's rarely boring, but it is long! At one point when it seemed to be nearing the end, I just had to pause it to go to do something only to see that I had one hour & twenty minutes left! I'm not sure much of what followed was needed. It has some similarities to the superior Edge of Tomorrow and, God help us, they are already discussing a sequel. Pratt was pretty much a revelation going from his hysterical Andy on Parks & Rec to the first Guardians of the Galaxy, but it's been all downhill ever since. Chris, I quit you.

172,Mivas_Greece,"The best fantasy/invasion movie of the year, one of the greatest ever! Could have been more serious, but great work has been done overall. A new MUST for the genre!",7,18 July 2021,"Invasion / fantasy / action movie. Inspired by invasion movies like Independence day (the gold standard in invasion films probably), invasion/fantasy/action movies like Edge of Tomorrow (probably the best in that mix of genres) and many more. Probably the best movie of its genre for 2021 and overall one of the very good ones. Chris Pratt is well-known in action / fantasy movies and is in his element. However, his completely cool and relaxed style could be omitted here and show a more serious character (in Jurassic Worlds he played more seriously anyway). The film as a whole is mainly supported by the much more serious Yvonne Strahovski who in the role of co-star is flawless. Also in an emotional moment she looks absolutely convincing unlike Pratt who seems a bit immature, as if he is not playing convincingly enough in this particular movie trying to maintain his cool style. Overall, however, the film had plenty of action and suspense and despite the long duration, it does not tire at all. It also has endless effects and some top scenes which are also the best of the movie. A lot of work has also been done on the aliens that seem quite real and convincing. The film has a slight influence from the Alien story with the creators and the monsters, but without its dark style. Some words and dialogues, as well as Charlie's character try to make the film lighter and less serious, something that in the genre is wrong in my opinion and loses points. Nevertheless, it is an extremely well-crafted film in action, effects, direction and acting, mainly by Yvonne Strahovski, and it is a new MUST for the film library of the fans of the genre.",The Tomorrow War

There are a plethora of plot holes, and just brain dead decisions that make absolutely no sense. I wont give details for the sake of spoilers, however it's full of typical movie tropes that you'll find yourself shaking your head at.If you want to watch a similar movie, just watch 'Edge of Tomorrow'.

When you watch this film you will see what I mean, so nothing new was brought to the table.The effects on most part were very good and I was impressed by them. Okay there were so.e scene a where the cgi didn't work and I am glad this film kept those scenes to a minimum.The acting in most part was as expected, nothing stand out. Chris Pratt' s role could have been taken on by any other actor, honestly he did an okay job once again nothing stand out.So o stall a movie that is worth a watch but don't expect anything special.

177,MamadNobari97,It's an Ok Movie If You Just Shut Your Brains Off,4,3 July 2021,"First of all, the movie is too long for it's own good, you're gonna literally beg it to end after the second act. The music is also too fkn loud and it hurts the first half actions.There are a lot of stupid plot holes and mistakes, and things I didn't like, but I try to point out the things I can think of now:Chris Pratt's daughter is researching on a toxin that CAN END THE WAR all ALONE by herself and a random citizen soldier that happens to be her dad? Like I know the population is 500k but there's seriously no other people that can help her?The movie tries to be sentimental and make you care about the characters but there's little to zero characterization to back it up. And there's a LOT of scenes with this intent that you just don't care about.The action is also not that great and creative, and most of the action mainly in the first half is just them shooting the Spikes in the streets and buildings and it's just boring.The time travel explanation, while being sufficient and making sense for this movie, felt like just a thing they came up in a hurry to make the audience question it less.The whole nations of the world are working together and all the brains of the world couldn't make a toxin in the future or present, OR figure out where tf the Spikes came from. But you who did? Yeah, a random military guy's wife! Like are you serious? I know you this guy is our protagonist -which you gave him the least characterization- but you're just gonna throw away logic and say this guy, his wife and her 9 yo girl saved the whole world with power of fahmily?!The first act of the movie is so fast-paced, especially in the actions scenes in the streets, that you can't process what's happening and feels like some scenes were cut, it's just too fast for its own good.The movie also tries to be funny multiple times but fails miserably.When they are in the future the capture the female Spike and suddenly the whole Spike population of earth is attacking them, so is there only one female? Where are the rest and why is it only one so important if we can see that in the original spaceship there are hundreds of them?Chris Pratt's daughter also doesn't kill the female one, because there's not enough toxin? Excuse me? Didn't you say you can shoot their abdomen and neck to kill them? Ok, maybe we can see that it's difficult to kill a female in the final act, but at least throw a grenade or c4 in there?How the hell did Omni-Man make a snowman so fast in the final act? And why tf did the female Spike attack it? Don't they know the difference between snow and a living thing? Maybe it was because of the black dot in the middle of the white snow, but the whole scene is still the most ridiculous scene.Chris Pratt jumping on the running Spike was just the script writers spitting on the word ""logic.""Also, where was the black guy (no characterization so no remember no name!) in the final act? We didn't see him at all until the father and son were laying on the ground.The father and son relationship was also shoehorned in just for the sake of it I guess. You can't tell me that you care about these characters with this little characterization and also awful ""family relationship clichés"" shoehorned in this movie.These were the things that I could think of, but you can nitpick the sht out of the whole time travel thing but it just don't worth it.",The Tomorrow War

It's a silly movie, with a couple of plot holes, but not as many as people say in the reviews. It just seems like the writers didn't have the time to work the script out. The jump point feels likes an unfinished thing, the aliens fear of fire is somehow ignored, some kid solves problems which should have been given to various people. There are some time travel problems, but of course there would be. Time travel is...somewhat a new concept for us, and we still don't get that it would be spacetime travel.

The performances are not perfect but they are remarkable, especially that of Yvonne Strahovski, most of the special effects are convincing and the production design is good, it is appreciated that the story is developed in only one movie and not divided for a sequel.I think the script is the movie's biggest problem, making it less enjoyable and very tedious.",The Tomorrow War

Huh? In shows like seal team, we see the wives demanding the guys to talk about their issues and if they don't they just leave them and take the kids.. think we would see a husband demanding the same from the wife leaving her alone without the children? Why we never saw this on tv and movies?Yeah, since reading reviews here and watching Joko Willink's reviews on movie scenes and weapon handling and stuff, I started paying attention to that.. I saw no one in this movie changing a mag lol... infinite ammo cheat code on.Killing off Chloe from 24 right at the begining.. no no.. she should've stayed instead of Charlie.. that by the way, where did he come from after Pratt just killed the queen? Dude just teleported outta the blue.I understand that leaving his daughter would've been difficult but it was kinda stupid to remain in the future knowing that the wise choice would be to go back and prevent that same future from happening..Anyway, because of the action and entertainment I give it 8/10.",The Tomorrow War

187,MoistMovies,Not to bad if you turn you brain off,7,2 July 2021,"It was a fun popcorn scifi-action flick. It didn't get into the finer details and did have some plot holes that if you get into them could ruin your enjoyment of the film.I chose to just sit back and take it for what it is.Also the theme of scientists being the main characters is always a nice one to come across in scifi films. Especially ones that can be watched by a younger audience.Which this film clearly tones down what could be a much more violent film, to put in moments of reminding the audience of the importance of family. A core running theme through the whole film.The acting was good, It is very much the Chris action film, everyone else is a side character. Nothing to complain about really. Chris in my opinion still needs to work on his acting abilities in serious action flicks. He is yet to find the right approach to them and i say 'yet'.. in my opinion.He does fine for now. But its not like watching one of your favorite action stars from the 80's-90's. Bruce willis always comes to mind. Not just die hard, but the fifth element and other action films he was in around that time, he actually tried and had certain style of acting that made the audience love his characters and him as a action star. Now Bruce stars in Z grade films that get 2 stars on imdb..
I do hope Chris grows as a action actor, he is a really genuine person off screen and most of us want to see him succeed. He does comedy really well.. I hope his range grows and he puts out even better films in the future within the action genre that are hard R and bloody. That will bring in big numbers.The effects were all very good. Tho felt somewhat wasted since this seems like it was a big budget and if only more went into the writing and elevating the film from popcorn level to very memorable science fiction film, I'd have appreciated that. But I still enjoyed the film so I can't complain much, but there was potential for an even better film.As far as i know this was not based on a book or anything. So it's great to see a big budget original screen play film thats not a remake, based off a book/game, live adaption of animation... you get my point im sure.So In any case i support the film on that front and give it one extra star.My score from what I think of the film is a 7.. but adding one for supporting a original screen play that's a high budget genre film.",The Tomorrow War

193,hoernkeem,"The Tomorrow War (2021, Chris McKay) Rough, Ready and kind of silly but not without some charm",4,24 July 2021,"'The Tomorrow War' is yet another major motion picture that was originally slated for a theatrical release in 2020, but got delayed due to the COVID pandemic. The rights were acquired by Amazon and it was finally released on digital on July 2, 2021. This has Chris Pratt front and center, who has become an action hero although it is unclear how popular he is outside of Marvel or Jurassic films which are mega-franchises. Other A-list names alongside Pratt include Yvonne Strahovski and J. K. Simmons. This is a science fiction action film with time travel elements. The film is directed by Chris McKay whose only substantial directing credit prior to 'The Tomorrow War' was 'The Lego Batman Movie.' Despite his directorial inexperience it isn't the direction that lets this film down. Most of what I didn't like about this movie stems from the writing which is derivative and downright head scratching at times regarding both characters' decision making as well as their time travel physics.In approximately 50 years the Earth gets stunned by a surprise alien attack that puts humanity at the edge of extinction. What is our grand plan to fight back? Journey into the past and draft people to fight in future. Chris Pratt is a high school teacher with a wife and daughter and just so happens to be an ex Army Ranger (always handy in alien killing scenarios) who gets drafted and sent to the future to fight. Their future tour only lasts for seven days due to the high mortality rate. The plot skips over a lot of exposition and literally drops our characters into the fray. During his time there Pratt's Dan Forester comes to find that humanity's forces are being led by his now grown daughter and not only did he die after a car accident, but he had previously left his wife and daughter for reasons. With his daughter's help he seeks a way to destroy the alien scourge all while restoring his faith in family including his daughter and his estranged father who later in the film has some convenient attributes to help his son on his mission. All this leads to a rousing alien/human showdown in a frozen waste where we triumph by the skin of our teeth.The action in the movie is actually pretty good, but the entire plot is so heavy handed with so many plot conveniences throughout that it is hard to not roll your eyes when they come about. For example there is a part where pivotal information is revealed, but they need a volcano expert to quiz on the information's meaning. Of course Pratt is a teacher and one of his pubescent students is a volcano geek and holds the key to humanity's salvation. These moments come up again and again. A major plot point is the fact that Pratt's character leaves his family, but they do an awful job of setting that up. It is so nonsensical that you agree with him when he exclaims he would never do that. Don't even get started on understanding the time travel. They basically opt for the no explanation version of time travel and therefore don't have to deal with any problems that would arise from sending these people forward and backward through a time rift. They have a couple of super light theories they toss out, but they ignore so much else that it is laughable that they tried to address it at all.This is a movie where you can turn off your brain and enjoy it for a couple hours, but if you engage that brain a smidge a lot of the story breaks down. The writing does not do the movie any favors as I have pointed out. Pratt really excels in roles that flex both action and comedy in equal measure which is one of the reasons he works so well in the MCU as well as the Jurassic movies. This is heavy handed and dark throughout which isn't best suited to his acting style. As much as I enjoy huge action franchises I would really enjoy some of these original ideas to step forward and compete with Marvel and others, but this is ultimately a letdown. It is derivative in so many areas including alien design and I am actually reading books from ten years ago that deal with a future war concept with much more hard science fiction. This movie is not awful or bad by any stretch, but it could have been so much better with a stronger plot and writing so for me it is a disappointment and a missed opportunity.Eric's Grade: C-",The Tomorrow War

Different age groups are also important to cover. Oh yes, the exact proportion of men and women in different roles also.Funnily, they seem to have completely ignored to include actors with Asian background.Well, you see what goes through ones head while watching this movie? It is so obvious. So blatant. And you ask yourself ""am I being brainwashed now?"". Shall I happily accept that the movie consists of what is politically correct instead of what would be perfect for each role?Apart from that it is well made.

So McKay and screenwriter Zach Dean decide to steal some ideas from some better movies: a key, time-defying father-daughter relationship (Interstellar); the weighty baggage remaining from a father-son relationship shaped by the effects of war (The Great Santini, last year's Father Soldier Son); the definitions and limitations of extreme bravery and intelligence; and the corrosive effects of war and conflict on entire families. These themes, while none are especially well-developed, do manage to slightly elevate this otherwise pedestrian and hopelessly derivative summer ""blockbuster."" As does the surprisingly fine performance of The Handmaid's Tale's Yvonne Strahovski. (I won't say who she plays, as that would be a spoiler of sorts.)

202,Paynebyname,Started interesting and then took a slow dive into banality,4,2 July 2021,"So the film started off okay with an interesting premise and a solid dad/daughter angle.The first action scene was good even though there were some holes with the 'endless bullet/no need to reload' magazines and the idea of novice members of the public still in work trouser suits handling weaponary with zero training.But then it was like the writers and director got bored or lazy. They had this whole narrative of how Chris had to save his daughter in the future even though it was obvious that he didn't have to save her in her future but rather change the future.Likewise when the males are attacking the base to retrieve the Queen, Chris was suggesting they kill the Queen and his daughter says 'we can't waste the formula'. Who needs a formula? She's chained up just put a bullet in her!And then the silly scene at the end that just had to be connected to global warming - yawn - was idiotic. Why go to the efforts to inject the chemical into the monsters if you can just blow the ship up.The film had the same kind of vibe and production values as Greenland with Gerard Butler and desperately wanted to be Live.

The bad guy will only be killed at the end of the movie. The good guys will get some serious beating prior to the former etc. So watching movies like this you can already tell who will die, and what won't happen or not happen. Like how the time travel device was intact whilst the rest of the ship was blowing up. Like how when he dived to rescue his daughter what exactly when he was teleported back. Like how he jumps from the copter to shoot one alien and the rest just stopped attacking. Like how the aliens are able to topple a humvee but they can't touch the daughter's humvee. And how do you return back from the future with a solution and no one wants to listen to you or help you? And oh is it surprising that his estranged father was the goto person for help, talk about being in a clutch?

205,theredsky,The Tomorrow War Review,4,8 July 2021,"This film spells out ""PERFECTLY AVERAGE"" in big bold letters. It isn't bad at all and it's a turn your brain off kind of movie but it still isn't great. Chris Pratt is good. He brings a fun and engaging set of charisma to his roles and he is no different here. His character is very one note though. His only motivation is that he cares about his daughter which isn't a bad motivation but the film is begging for more character development so that the emotional moments feel more impactful. Sam Richardson was fun but he really doesn't do a lot during the movie besides adding some comic relief to it. All of the other characters are very forgettable although I did enjoy J. K. Simmons presence even if he had basically nothing to do. Since this is a time travel movie, the logic is out of the window. There were several moments involving the creatures or characters that made me think, ""Hold on. That's a big paradox"". One moment involves Chris Pratt's character and the general from 50 years in the future. He wants to bring her back to the future with him but he cares so much about doing it that he almost dies at one point which would have screwed over the people in the past. And even if he succeeded in bringing her back, that would have created a massive paradox with two of the same character not to mention that she would just disappear since the future wouldn't happen. Like I said, the more you think about it, the worse the story gets. The action is fine. It isn't super impressive but it's not bad. It's serviceable for the story and it has its moments. The visual effects, aside from a few shots, are really impressive actually. The creature design looks terrifying and the visual effect artists do a great job making them look real. If anything, you should check this movie out for that. If you want a fun Chris Pratt movie then I would recommend checking this out but don't expect a masterpiece.",The Tomorrow War

Teammate fights, solo fights, vehicle fight, boss fights and final Big Boss fight that is incredible. Didn't know what they were going to do in the final 30 minutes but they knocked it out of the park. Some reviewers keep wondering why Pratt cared about saving his daughter in the future when by going back and stopping the war he saved her anyway. SIMPLE LOGIC. The future timeline still exists and that adult daughter stil dies. When he goes back a new timeline was created. There are lapses in logic. Why not just blow up the ship and avoid conflict? Anyway great action, explosions and flawless CGI ( can't believe I didn't see this in the theatre ). If the ending doesn't leave you with a smile you might not have a soul. Pratt gives it his all and the supporting cast also delivers ; some with humorous moments. The movie also takes it time before it shows you the aliens. A total winner.

The screenwriter's concept of ""time travel"" changes every time there is a need to plug a big hole in the script. What is this? Many Worlds? Deterministic? Random? Certainly the writers don't have any concept that they can consistently hold on to.So many of the scenes have no logical sense. People act in ways that defy all reason. The monsters too seem to change in their abilities depending on who they are attacking (Grunts - lethal aliens. Chris Pratt - aliens that are easily killed). On top of that, Chris Pratt can't act.Overall a complete waste of time. So much could have been done with the concept but the opportunity was squandered.

211,ssvfolder-1,A show but a bit ridiculous plot even by sci-fi standards,6,2 July 2021,"The movie should be a show, and the creators of this movie made a mix of ""the edge of tomorrow"" and ""World War Z"". The plot is not good by a Sci Fi standards. The best example of the modern show that emphasizes that genre is an amazing ""Rick and Morty"". There were so many possibilities of time travel to exploit in this movie, but for some reason they went with the simple go-to scenario where the hero saves the world in his own timeline with a little help from the future. It's just felt a lazy writing all together, especially in the second part of the movie. The explanation that time link is being held together by a ""chewing gum"" is dumb to the very least.This movie does not push any borders and try to click all the right buttons, but it all seems so co cowardly. They have their main hero in a form of Chris Pratt, who's clearly tries to follow footsteps of Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise, as being the most perfect hero\father he can be. They've got the stranded Father-son and father-daughter relationships that get a second chance. They've got a plethora of African American secondary heroes, not to upset the viewers about misrepresenting. They've got a lot of women in positions of power and so popular nowadays a mean white guy in a place of power that takes all the credit to himself. Anyhow Woke agenda is fulfilled so what's left is trying to make a show, and a decent show they did. Most of it goes to visual effects, that closely remind those of previously mentioned movies, but still it gets the job done for couple of hours.There are some generic ""feel good"" moments at the end of the movie, so you finish watching it on a high note, but it feels as really missed opportunity.

Lack of new shows and movies because they have been postponed or delayed has been frustrating as a viewer; as such, I am overjoyed by a slightly above average film release like this one. There hasn't been a new blockbuster film in a long time. Sci-Fi big budget films for the year remain at one with Dune and that has been postponed almost an entire year! I was glad when this film came out.The Tomorrow War with Chris Pratt is a good film. It's not a masterpiece of film cinema; however, it does fit into the same sci-fi genre as the new Godzilla film. Due to that fact and the fact that it has an A-List actor like Chris Pratt who pretty much carries the entire film on his acting chops. Any other actor in this same role could have made this film a straight up flop; as such, Pratt delivers.The films has fantastic CGI and some of the epic wide shots are stunning and amazing to look at. The premise for the film is very basic, more basic then I was expecting. Even so, the film works with a simple plot, good acting, great effects and enough sci-if in there to make it a sci-if film! So I am going to give this fun action film a solid 7/10 which is a good rating for any sci-if film. If you like fun summer sci-fi action then this is one not to miss!",The Tomorrow War

Especially the stairwell scene.A few points off for the last 30 minutes though...they really dragged...and in my opinion, they could of been condensed to maintain the pace. The film dragged for a bit in the middle too, when it went all 'luvvy duvvy' for about 10 minutes, but that wasn't too bad...and the pace soon picked up again.Sadly, it was a bit of a weak final boss battle, with the same old 'think it's dead and relax...BUT NO, IT'S NOT DEAD!' tropes.Overall, a solid horror/action film...a little longer than it really needed to be, but still a great watch.Would recommend.",The Tomorrow War

Chris Pratt's acting, seeing his daughter was so well acted that I teared up a bit.In the third, and what felt like the fourth, act, I was expecting a moment where the main characters kills all the enemies and then, suprisingly, one egg survives or whatever. It didn't happen though, and it was so damn satisfying. There was no setup for a sequel, and the film was so much better for it. It doesn't need one.The film had some clichés, ones that were acceptable but that lowered the score. Every actor was very very good, even the child actor.I have to say, in the third act, there was one scene that was on the same level as the Valkyrie scene in Thor Ragnarok, it was beautiful to look at.All in all, a good film that's very entertaining!",The Tomorrow War
235,julieshotmail,Predictable and uninspired,3,11 July 2021,"This is a long movie which I watched in short 30-minute installments while getting a workout on the treadmill. The plot is predictable enough that you don't really need to pay attention to get the gist of it. All the while I thought this movie had the vibes of a Tom Cruise vehicle, except a younger Chris Pratt is used, who is capable enough in terms of acting chops but lacks the same level of intensity. Also, you will encounter plot holes galore - first you raise your eyebrow, then shake your head, and ultimately shrug your shoulders and move on. I would not recommend actually taking time to sit through this while not doing other things at the same time. That would be just a waste of a couple of hours.",The Tomorrow War
236,matrixdukenukem,I had a B L A S T,10,2 July 2021,"After seeing some of the negative reviews by ""critics"" I didn't have any hopes for this. I am not seeing much promotion for this movie being a high budget action starring Chris Pratt. But this satisfied my craving for a holiday action thriller. Sci fi takes a back seat though.So yeah don't go in expecting this is Edge of Tomorrow though it might remind you of that. The story is kind of sort of like that. But this also has Battle Los Angeles vibe to it. And I love both of those movies.Let's start with positives. Chris Pratt is good, other actors have some a decent job. Sam Richardson as comic relief is a standout though. For a pop corn flick like this the story was good (not mind blowing). The sound design and visual effects was great except for one or two places.Star of the show are creatures. They are fast, unpredictable and show many good kills. The horror elements were done well in couple scenes. Action and battle scenes were jaw dropping. The female extraction, first battle and final combat was very creative, not too many cuts, not dark, or any funny businesses. Just all around good action.Now to the negatives. If you're gonna use your brain, you won't enjoy this. There are just few too many plot holes amd unanswered questions. Chris Pratt and J. K. Simmons relationship didn't work. The connection between Chris Pratt's elder daughter and him felt empty.Overall, I had an itch for this kind of movie and this movie scratched it for me. I would watch this again.",The Tomorrow War

A good action movie on a Sunday afternoon with popcorn and pop and you're in heaven.If you like good story lines, great acting and you've read a book at some stage in your life, then this isn't for you.For me it was full of plot holes. Loved the quick explanation on a paradox. When you haven't been born yet, you can't travel in to the future so you have to be over 40. And the only ones that can travel are the ones who will be dead by the time they get to the year 2050(or around then). That's it folks, simple.For God sake, read more and find competent writers.Apparently the world is the USA. No other nations were involved despite the long diatribe on the nations being one in fighting these aliens.Anyway, its a ride that goes too long at 2hrs 18mins and seems its trying to be all things to all people.

There are staff on set whose only job is to make sure the actors always look the same for different shots of a scene, so why isn't there someone who looks for plot holes??? I'm in disbelief.Another major gripe was that this clearly was mastered in 2K, not 4K. Seriously, when will there be a class-action lawsuit on this false ""UHD"" stuff?The one bright spot I have to say was Yvonne. She really sucked me in with her character and I think she easily did the best acting in the film. Whenever she's on-screen, you believe her 100%. Bravo.",The Tomorrow War

246,RMurray847,Brain dead plot and bored actors,4,11 July 2021,"I didn't expect much going into this film. The trailers are pretty clear that this is a loud, noisy, silly alien invasion film, with a time travel twist. But should have been good, clean fun.It is fun at times, but the tone of the whole thing is off. The scenes that should be funny aren't all that funny. The touching scenes aren't. And the usually charming Chris Pratt isn't. He just seems to be working SO hard to be light and breezy and sincere...and he comes of totally generic. Just like the aliens. Yet another film where the aliens are essentially giant insects that can't really be killed by the firing the really fast guns at them. A supporting cast with promise, but little to do. Sam Richardson, normally effortlessly funny, shows himself sweating. Betty Gilpen is wasted as ""the wife"" when she could bring so much more to the table. JK Simmons is actually quite good, but then they give him little to do. I'd say Yvonne Strahovski (who I was guilty of under-estimating until she blew me away in HANDMAID'S TAIL) comes off best. She handles her weapons well, and brings just about the only glimmers of emotion to the whole affair.The time travel element is unusual, but holds very little credibility. Warriors arrive from the future (this is NOT a spoiler unless you haven't seen a preview) to everyone that mankind is near the end and the only solution is to bring more soldiers from OUR time to the future to help fight. They invented time travel (never explained) and used it to recruit soldiers with no training to fight a war with weapons that don't do jack squat anyway. They didn't come with an idea of nipping the aliens in the bud before they get started??? Or simply to warn folks to start preparing? Maybe bring a dead alien back to start figuring out how to kill them? Nope. The basic concept of this movie is just brain dead and it's hard not to get incredibly frustrated with it.The action scenes, while a little generic, are fun and frantic and provide the requisite entertainment value. But that's pretty skimpy for a 2 hour 20 minute movie. It felt longer. No action movie should feel too long...you should be breathless and excited, not vaguely bored.Disappointing film.",The Tomorrow War

248,ewaf58,Could have been so much better,6,5 July 2021,Uneven in tone - lacking in logic especially when it comes to time paradoxes - but has decent action sequences.It seems like the script writer - story writer - Producers and Director were not in the same room during preproduction.The film is disjointed and never really knows what its trying to be - a buddy movie - a serious time travel movie - a movie about family love or an all action humans vs monsters flick.As a result you feel as though you are watching several different films that have been clumsily stitched together.But the actions sequences are good thanks to hundreds of clearly hard working FX artists while the monsters make your average Zombie look like a friendly neighbour.Personally I would have ditched the idea of time travel and produced it as a straight monster movie as the aliens themselves were capable of providing all the action - and gore - the movie fans of the genre love.,The Tomorrow War

250,Alcaminhante,More creative than I thought it was going to be.,7,12 August 2021,"I was prepared to hate this movie as I cannot stand Hollywood blockbusters anymore but I didn't.The only thing that annoyed me was the total predictability of every plot point/character purpose. I guessed every single supposed twist or surprise or connection in this entire thing and that was starting to really making me dislike the movie at some point. Particularly in the middle section with all the boring action super hero style stuff seen a million times before. Lots of excellent cgi, action everywhere, zero suspanse. 100% predictability to the very second. I could even guessed how the next shot was gonna be framed. My god...But...
Somehow I just disconnected from it all at some point.Maybe I just gave up and stared at the screen because I had nothing better to do, but then from the moment I looked at it as if it was just a dumb but sometimes creative American comic book that had to cater for the ""Idiocracy"" audiences of current times and managed to do that very well.And managed to do that without trying to insert forced current social issues of whatever is trendy this week in the woke online trolls community too. So that was a plus point for me.I started to have fun with the predictability of it all. Loved the obvious father connection and I thought the gag with the loving volcano kid was fun so I don't think it's that dumb overall. The movie is just a bubble gum sci-fi action thing. Excellent concept, great initial moments and a fun conclusion in the snow that reminded me of a bubble gum version of some scenes in The Thing when they explore the ice plains and blast the snow.Overall I reached the end glad I stocked with the movie. It had some very good concepts scattered here and there, the characters were fun and everything was just like a roller coaster ride where we know what is going to happen but it's fun anyway.In truth considering the comic bubble gum angle of it all I think this is a very entertaining movie. Just leave your brain on the side and go with it.I'm probably buying it on Blu-ray to have the original in my collection just in case someone in the future complains about something and then future releases on streaming will be censored or changed maybe to include some lgbt aliens in there too as we never know this days what's coming from studios to please the woke trolls out there.So 7.5 out of 10 for me.

This movie looks like something that came out 20 years ago, it was unpleasant to look at. Not only that the movie looks awful the story is also stupid. Why bother sending civilians to the future to win a war when you can just prevent it from happening. I mean they end up doing that but why can't they just do that in the first place.I'm not a time travel expert but time travel in this movie makes zero sense. So they travel back in time using a jumplink, one is placed in 2051 and the other one is in 2021. Basically they created the jumplink in 2051 but how tf the other jumplink is in 2021, how is that make any sense. It feels like they just threw a bunch of stuff together and glue it with chewing gum and chicken wire (hahaha funny right) and expect the viewers to just let it go and not think about it.The pacing of this movie is horrible, I have no clue why this movie is over 2 hours long. They wasted so much time on a plot that doesn't even make any sense. If you want people to enjoy this as a fun mindless action movie well then go for it, don't waste 60 minutes on something that's really stupid.The main character has no character, oh he's an ordinary man who loves his wife and has a daughter and he wants to save the world for his daughter, wow so relatable.

However, I was disappointed to see they were calling the Aliens ""male"" and ""female."" You'd think society would have moved on by then - or from THIS science at least. As a matter of fact, why are they even being referred to as ""Aliens?"" It's hurtful and xenophobic. Perhaps if enough people complain they will refer to them as ""Space Immigrants"" in the sequel.Some annoying distractions.... Humans develop time travel but no new weapons, gear, or tactics? I noticed ordinary clips but imagined a SAW mag. Forgive me but I had no choice considering all the rounds they were squeezing off.... Is this being insensitive? The biggest twist in the entire movie was to put the ""white"" male in charge when there was a ""black"" dude far more qualified. I was like ""whoa"" what just happened? I immediately paused it to reflect. Woke-ism and nepotism are cut from the same cloth, for sure, but still I didn't see that one coming. Then I realized that even this far into the future it's obvious we will still have to deal with ""white privilege."" Deep and complex.

Anyway, It took a little time to warm up to her but I was able to eventually get into her role and see her for the badass she was in this film.What I really loved overall about this film is that is caused me to feel a range of emotions. It wasn't ""just"" about fighting aliens. I mean of course that was a huge part of it but, I dunno, I just really resonated with the family stuff and people getting drafted even though it was clear they weren't fit to be sent to the future and the sheer overwhelm of having to face an obstacle so big it seems pointless to even try. The scene where the Whitespikes got out onto the ship and you just see thousands of those effers headed their way is specifically what I'm talking about.Anyway, that's all I'll say on it.

While it's a bit half baked (more on that later), it's intriguing enough to keep you hooked and wanting to see what happens next. I also really liked how unabashedly old school and schlocky this movie is. I think that avid fans of 80s and 90s action films will enjoy this one.The action scenes are also quite fun and I won't like that I was hooting and hollering by the film's final battle, one of many legitimately exhilarating set pieces.The Bad: this movie is very dumb. There is a lot here that may make the highly attentive viewer go nuts, such as how these ""future humans"" have seemingly convinced the entire human population to go to war without any photo or video evidence of the war or how unbelievably unprepared the soldiers they send are for the conflict itself (and then they wonder why they're losing). But more than just ""dumb,"" the film's script suffers as soon as Pratt meets Strahovski and it becomes another generic action movie, just to sort of save it in the end with the final act.I wish this super long movie was structured in a way where the audience leaves with a great understanding of the world, the concept is baked into the story and it lives up to its innovative premise. As it stands, the film only gets halfway there.It also suffers from a script that plays it too cute at times. While I understand the need for levity, this movie is chock full of humour that's a) not particularly funny and b) poorly placed.The Ugly: I don't hate this film's visuals. It's just...perhaps being recently spoiled by a Quiet Place II, I can't help but see the ""Whitespikes"" as a bit generic and reminiscent of video game villains (literally, they look like they were ripped out of Resistance or Gears of War).

Moreover, amateur film critics will inevitably compare this film to several other films in the Time Travel/Alien Invaders genre, and I suspect The Tomorrow War will take some ""below the belt"" shots long before most audiences will have had an opportunity to screen this movie themselves on Amazon.Personally, I enjoyed this little film. The acting was genuine, the special effects were slick, and unlike several recent science fiction films released this year, the film's plot was fluid and easy to understand. If you enjoy action, science fiction, drama and targeted comedy, you're likely to embrace this fast-paced film quite easily.

A bunch of soldiers from the future come to the present to tell humanity about a war that is about to begin in the year 2046. So far - so good. Then governments from our time decide to send hundreds of thousands of untrained civilians in the future to die a horrible death. Let's say this is understandable. (Although it isn't.) Then, well, the viewers watch dumbfounded, as not a single government official on the entire planet in our time even thinks of, you know, researching the future enemy, trying to find where they land before they appear and nip the future war in the bud. No, they just send their people to die, although they know perfectly well that they achieve nothing. I wouldn't even mention this, by the way, if this movie's writers hadn't made the brilliant decision to have a volcano loving high school nerd find the location of the aliens using only his laptop.And this is the least of the movie's problems, believe me. The main characters are, supposedly, brilliant. Chris Pratt is a science teacher and an experienced soldier. Yvonne Strahovski is literally the best scientist of her time and also an incredible soldier. Let me give you an example of these two's brilliance. They've managed to capture a female alien alive to use it for experiments to develop a toxin that can kill all aliens. Understandable, right? They know that female aliens call males to the rescue and males flock to save and protect them. So what do they do with this information? They promptly forget to sedate the alien when that becomes convenient for the plot, and then decide they don't need to kill it, while it calls an army of males big enough to destroy the entire military base they're in.

Has a big budget and some blockbuster names (mainly Chris Pratt) and you have your new theaterless release. Good acting from the cast, no problem there, special effects no problem there. Just seems to be missing something I haven't put my finger on it ( most likely the script). But it's worth watching if you don't have anything better to do.

The acting is entertaining, the premise interesting if a bit ridiculous scientifically, and in general there are the makings of great summer movie.However, there are plot holes galore, Hollywood continues to abuse natural law and physics, and it's simply too darn long. 140 minutes? Get rid of the filler, reduce the number of characters, tighten the whole thing up and you'd have something.Questions you'll be asking yourself during the movie:1. Why don't they use heavier caliber weapons?2. How did the primitive human race still using 1980's weapons tech create time-displacing wormholes ?3. Why don't they just blow up the space ship in the first place instead of trying to poison the inhabitants?I could go on, but I've made my point.

You can't leave a 2-hour-something film with these huge plot holes and these silly moments of dialogue unchecked.Why do the studios approach their audience in that un-intelligent way? I find it unfair and as a viewer, I believe we deserve more.It's actually a pity because they took so much time to build up the characters, explain the story, the enemy and the time travel properties in the first 30-45min, but then...what happened? HUGE plot holes and a couple of odd dialogue moments which literally make no sense. Don't want to spoil it; you will know when see these.Some good points: CGI is good and the aliens seem bad enough. Score is also alright and helps the pace of the film.And in fact, there are some impressive moments in the film, e.g the landing to the future...but once you finish watching this film you will understand the silliness of the story.Regardless, I can recommend it for a lazy Sunday but don't expect something special.

279,ObsessiveCinemaDisorder,Entertaining Formulaic Sci-Fi Actioner that does the job!,7,11 July 2021,"The Tomorrow War is an entertaining formulaic popcorn film that delivers on its high-concept sci-fi action and is elevated by the charm of its lead star, Chris Pratt. The time travel elements, while familiar, are different enough to keep things fresh. Every penny of its 200-million-dollar budget is put on screen and it makes for a satisfying one-time watch.Star Chris Pratt has a charismatic way of humanizing the scene and pulling in the audience along. He has progressively gotten better at this since Guardians of the Galaxy. Many times in the film, whenever the film would start to remind me of another film, Pratt, usually with a humorous quip or sharing a smile with his onscreen daughter, would charm me back into the story. Without Pratt, The Tomorrow War would likely seem more like a Gerard Butler actioner.In their supporting roles, Yvonne Strahovski and J. K. Simmons make for great scene partners with Chris Pratt, who is stronger in reacting to other actors as opposed to doing a scene solo. Their scenes left more to be desired but unfortunately, the fast-moving plot took first priority.Chris McKay, director of The Lego Batman Movie, keeps the plot moving along and the film functions under the Alfred Hitchcock fridge logic rule. Everything's done well and fast enough to distract the audience from thinking about the things that don't quite add up.For example, the monsters, called Whitespikes, were built up nicely. Initially, we don't see the monsters, which effectively let the audience imagine their look before revealing them. Once the Whitespikes reveal themselves, they are viscerally threatening enough for a thrill but afterward, you will come to the conclusion that these monsters are much easier to defeat than the film lets on.The action sequences are well-staged and thrilling. Watching all the big-budgeted spectacle had me realizing that I was watching it at home from a streaming platform and not as a theatrical release. I almost felt bad for the film. With the rise of streaming platforms and COVID-19, how audiences watch a movie will probably continue to change. This is just the beginning.In the world where every commercial Hollywood film is planned with franchise potential, the world-building in The Tomorrow War comes up short. The monsters are merely functional and not inherently fascinating on a story level. A sequel has just been greenlit by the studios but as of right now, I have no real interest to see this story continue. The Tomorrow War was fine as a one-time watch.",The Tomorrow War

285,javiergarcon,It brought tears to my eyes when I saw him losing his daughter,9,4 July 2021,"A very complicated Time traveling movie, I can see how it can be very personal for Chris Pratt to hold on to the future and wanting to go back to it because he is suffering from PTSD. It is normal. When your in time displacement your mind is stuck in that time and when your in that time you perceive that time as your owen and not the previous time you come from and that is what the writer of this movie is trying to give us, It is hard to write that in and for the actor to act this within a specific amount of time. Psychologically one has to put oneself in the shoes of Chris pratt and feel how mental it is to travel through time, your brain is being rewired when your jumping! Hell your stomach and your insides are like coming out of you when you jump and the actors did a fabulous job at acting this out. So many psychological events in this movie especially the multi fascids of PTSD, Group therapies with victims coming back from war having PTSD also the people going back to war reenlisting and carrying claws from their enemies around there necks as reminders of there battles with them shows you another element of mental anguish and psychological trauma. I have to say this whole movie is focused on multi levels of psychological traumas and eventually how one deals with it by ""manning up"" Or just in other words deal with it and pushing through by accomplishing the task and never giving up. At the end he finally changes the timeline knowing that his daughter died in another timeline that existed. (Remember people that multi universes exist all he did was branch off a new universe when he came back and created a new future when he started to change the future. He created a paradox! There is a timeline where he came back and died and it still exist but now there is this timeline what we just witnessed but we all know and he knows about his daughter that died in the future) Time travel is a Fickle thing! It does not exist even if you tried to change the future your only creating new branches never replacing the old meaning you are never impressing anyone whatever changes you made)",The Tomorrow War

And just as the daughter got too whiney, I could sense that Pratt was going to be traveling back & forth in time to fix his family life & save his daughter from being such a whiney mess, not to mention her life. Did not finish.Aside from that, the fundamentals are so ridiculous, includinga) They travel back in time 30 yrs to do what? Get a bunch of untrained people to shoot at the aliens? And that is what the idiots of the present do. What? You now have 30 years of warning that aliens will attack earth. You know when & where & the aliens' methods, strengths & weaknesses. Figure out how to avoid the war or be 100% prepared for it when it starts. Duh. Don't send old, untrained ladies to shoot at aliens with shotguns. LOL.B) Why has the weaponry not improved at all in 30 yrs? In 30 years, we figured out time-travel, but a lot of the guns are worse than ever, there are no exo-skeletons, no AI robot warriors, not even any Sky-Net. Oh my.

A lot of money went into this and it is clearly well made.Unfortunately it seems to have been written by people who were either joking or morons.I don't need a movie to be brilliant to enjoy it. I don't even need it to be plausible. I do however need it to at least look like it's trying to give me the outline of something that could make sense.There is too much stupid in this movie to give an exhaustive list but my top 3 annoyances are:1) With the benefit of 30 years notice of an alien invasion and a time travel portal that can seemingly transport an unlimited amount of people and material both ways, we are meant to believe the best solution the entire world could come up with to fight the aliens is to hand civilians with no training guns and then batch drop them into the alien hordes in their hundreds of thousands to be slaughtered.2) When the aforementioned civilians are being slaughtered 10 mins after arriving in the future, instead of being struck dumb with terror, they still have time for plenty of wisecracks.3) The ending... oh the ending. Just when I thought peak stupidity had been reached, after consulting a child in high school class (I kid you not) for the solution the 'heroes' decide not to involve governments of the world and end the alien threat all by themselves with Chris Pratt killing the final alien in hand to hand combat.",The Tomorrow War

292,Stream2BigScreen_Movie_Reviews,The Tomorrow War is Today and the Longest War in History,7,3 July 2021,"Welcome Back to Stream to Big Screen! This week let's take a trip to the future to fight The Tomorrow War. This Prime Video summer blockbuster was released for streaming this Independence Day weekend. A sci-fi, action, adventure, thriller what more could a viewer ask for on a holiday weekend. The Tomorrow War depicts a future world in which a group of time-traveling soldiers arrive and ask for help to fight a global war against a deadly alien species. Among those recruited is high school teacher and family man, Dan Forester (Chris Pratt). Determined to save the world for his young daughter, Dan teams up with a brilliant scientist (Yvonne Strahovski) and a rag tag crew to rid the world of these aliens. Let's see if it's worth watching.The Tomorrow War has so much potential. I mean just check out the trailer below. It had some creative elements, but then the filmmakers decided to make it as predictable and cliched at every possible moment you'd expect. I mean this is like the greatest mish mosh of summer blockbuster movies I've ever seen. If you like any of the movies I'm about to say, you will absolutely like or be entertained by The Tomorrow War. Here we go: this movie was concocted in a lab with remnants of Independence Day, World War Z, Edge of Tomorrow with a little mix of Prometheus. I mean that's a pretty good line-up... right?! Yeah, but not when you know the everything before they happen. For what it's worth, the story is sincere at times, but then again, it's the same story we've seen. ""I gotta save my daughter..."" *boo hoo!* ""Oh wow these aliens are dangerous... let's go do some reckless stuff that doesn't make sense to stop them."" Shock and awe!Anyway, Chris Pratt is typically a solid actor, but here he was just Pratt from everything else. He's part Peter Quill, Grady from Jurassic World and shoot even Emmett Brickowski (just kidding but that made me chuckle). The rest of the cast is ok at best but shout out to J. K. and him bringing extra swag to this flick. They didn't use him that much but his scenes were worth it. Either way, just like the characters falling in the movie this movie is chalk full of plot holes. Some holes are so big you get Tenet-brain. You ask, ""what's Tenet-brain, S2S?"" Tenet-brain, formerly Inception-brain, is when you really start to think about what happens in the movie the movie just gives you a headache and or comes apart at the seams. It's best to go into a potential Tenet-brain movie with an open and empty mind. Let the movie just entertain you and not inform you. As this movie runs for 2 hours and 15 minutes, they try to inform you a lot and you have to duck and dodge all of the plot holes that might make you think. The movie feels like 4 different movies in one and while that may seem good... it just feels so long.SUPER LONG STORY short, The Tomorrow War is a solid movie that was just too protracted. Led by Chris Pratt as a less annoying Peter Quill, the movie is entertaining and family friendly with the action and thrills many like to watch. The Tomorrow War absolutely could've come to the theaters and done well as a long standing matinee flick but it's probably better suited as a streaming flick on Amazon Prime with a bowl of popcorn.",The Tomorrow War

294,benprichardsdotcom,"Young, dumb and full of fun",5,31 August 2021,"From the very opening scene this film could either two ways: if you're going to have the protagonist free-fall from a great height into a 6' deep swimming pool on the top of a high-rise building then you need to stick with that film logic. Even when one of the Drill Sergeants tells the conscripted that they should expect to fall between 5 to 10 feet why not give them some kind of device to break their fall? Half the bloody soldiers would be breaking their legs/ankles or dead from a fall of 10' anyway! This might, and admittedly it is a small hill to die on but it just revealed the lack of intelligence in the writing from the off. Either that or an insult to the intelligence of the audience. Oh and regarding the opening scene we figured out straight away that it was the Qatar World Cup which will be in winter of 2022 so chuckled at the expositional explanation that it was in fact World Cup 2022 on the tele.The main gripe I have with The Tomorrow War is it was like an algorithm took the following films:Starship Troopers
Guardians of the Galaxy
Interstellar
Aliens
Edge of Tomorrow (heavily influenced)And just assaulted you with elements of all the best bits of them. TTW just couldn't settle down and realise what motion picture it wanted to be. There were some genuinely funny moments which, if they were there throughout the film then great but the humour was only there when the algorithm spat it out. The pathos wasn't really there for me because surely Chris Pratt's character must know that by using the green stuff in 2022 means that his daughter doesn't die in the was she was about to when he teleported back. Also, on the subject of that green stuff if they could just destroy the ship with explosives why not just go quiet, set up the bombs, then detonate from afar - problem solved, no Tomorrow War.It's fun if you don't think about it unfortunately for me if you abandon the very logic you set up in a story it jar me out of the illusion.

302,Mike_O_Dwyer,So Bad It's Almost Worth Watching,2,6 July 2021,"Hands down one of the worst scripts ever to make it to screen and, once there, gallops towards being one of the worst directed movies.Chris Pratt comes from the raised eyebrow school of action heroes, think Roger Moore without the charm and layers of extra ham. Outside of knowing comedic roles his lack of subtlety and range is laid bare, and it's jarring when he comes up against far better actors like Strahovski, Simmons, and Gilpin who all seem to be in a different - and far better - movie to Pratt.It's not all on Pratt though, The Tomorrow War is a bungling mess of a thing patched together with alien invasion cliches and dialogue that every other sci-fi movie since the 80s had deemed unfit for purpose. Half of the movie looks like it was shot and lit on a daytime soap set after everyone had gone home, the other half is a cgi fest of explosions, unlimited bullets, and aliens that manage to take over the world despite being relatively easy to kill.

It's the Sharknado of time travel movies.Tomorrow-nado.Time-nado.Pratt-nado.There is nothing original in this movie other than the CGI. The writer cribbed together every scene they liked from the last 40 years worth of movies, starting with the Alien franchise.Every noteworthy scene is lifted from superior films. It's disappointing for people who love movies to see someone blatantly copying better movies we have all seen a hundred times because we love them so much. It's like watching a petty thief pilfer goods from your favorite local stores. It's sad and disheartening.But I suppose you can still have fun pointing out the treasure trove of moments stolen from other movies. The spikes remind me of the mutant that chased Wolverine through the woods in X-Men: The Last Stand. FWIW his character is named Spike.For comparison Tremors 7 was time better spent. It's fun and stupid and we can guess what's going to happen. But you aren't second guessing your intelligence the entire time. ""This seems familiar right?! We've heard this story before?"" And if you think the Tremors creatures are dumb looking wait till you get a close up of the White Spikes. A terrible name for a ridiculous looking and not-very-scary alien.Even the title is a crib.

I watched this film with the expectation that it will be just another sci-fi like Aliens, The Edge of Tomorrow, etc... however, boy was I in for a surprise.This film includes several elements such as sci-fi, family, war, etc... and the actors put on a performance of a lifetime. Even Gilpin's minor role, she did it so well as a wife of a combat veteran coming back from a war, it was heart wrenching watching her expression.The movie started slow, but once the aliens were revealed, it was just moment to moment action while you grip on to the edge of your seat. The actions were fast, but yet with slow motion when you need to see clearly what was happening. Pacing along with the music, the first scene came off like a war movie and you can really feel the fear and anguish, as well as the courage of the fighters as they fought an impossible battle.However, what was most touching was the main theme involving the protagonist as he went through the journey of self realization about family value, forgiveness, and 2nd chance. The ending was the most satisfying as it comes full circle and you realize all along it was about the transformation of the protagonist in how to be a real man.",The Tomorrow War
305,pronitmallick,You can watch again just for the sake of action,5,4 July 2021,The Tomorrow War is a movie that starts in a janky way and goes on keeping up a pacing like that. Right from the beginning everything seems like it's rolling really fast. When we get to the real deal of the movie it doesn't add up with the feeling and doesn't throw anything special which will bond us to the movie. The way the presentation of this film is made it feels like a letdown and because of that the audience can easily predict what may happen next or can happen. One of the letdowns of this movie will be Chris Pratt doesn't delivering a performance which will give you the proper feel and overall the performance of everyone stays average or above average sometimes. Editing and transitions definitely could have needed some more polish. The thing that makes this film even go lower than it's standards is the story itself. The story feels like it's the addition or mixture of some previous popular apocalyptic movies like terminator or independence day or maybe pacific rim. In the end this movie will give you some minimal feelings in it's entire two hours run but overall it feels like a total time pass movie on the weekend which you wanna watch sometime again just for action only.,The Tomorrow War
306,James_Denton,Given it's hype I had higher hopes for this film but what we ended up seeing is a story told before with corny dialogue and low budget 'aliens',6,3 July 2021,"The Tomorrow War (2021) had the potential to be much better than what we saw, as a result we went from eagerly looking forward to see it to groans and moans about it's corny dialogue and low budget puppet aliens.The good and the bad:
The hype for this film really built it up well - particularly on IMDB where the home page has been adverting it for the last month or soThe cast is great. I like Chris Pratt not only is he renown for being a nice guy but he comes across well both in films and interviews, and is well placed in the role as Dan ForesterThe big moment of seeing the aliens is great from a distance it great, but were disappointing and comical close upThe story is where the downsides begin to surface. Its been told before, most notably in the now discontinued Travelers (2016)The dialogue is corny, although at times amusing too - the irony being the best lines came from the supporting cast Charlie, Norah and Cowan - my wife was having a good giggle at some of itThe film does a great job in answering questions some viewers would not doubt having been asking while watching it, an example, explaining how you can't meet yourself in the past or future - brilliant!Overall, the film felt a cross between Travelers (2016) where the future needs help from the past, Edge of Tomorrow (2014) with a heroic female character, saviour of mankind, who outwardly is focussed solely on saving humanity and Starship Troopers (1997) with thousands of aliens storming forward overwhelming any defence.The film is entertaining but given how good it could have been falls well short of this mark.

Here's where it all went in the toilet for me.The daughter tells the father in the future, she can figure out the toxin that will kill the aliens. But he will have to take it back to the past to mass produce it, so he can prevent the alien war from ever happening. But he says no because that would mean he would have to leave her in the future to die.So ?? He would rather watch his daughter die in the future --- than go back to the past, and save his daughter's life --- and all of humanity ?? Stupid.Anyway --- against his will, he goes back to the past --- and what do you know, his daughter is still alive. He and his wife try to figure out when and where the aliens arrive.It doesn't make any difference now. They now have the toxin to kill them when or wherever they arrive.They go to some government guy (I think it's the president) and explain the situation. And the government guy basically says he cannot justify spending taxpayer money on saving humanity. Even though society is falling apart worldwide because everybody believes aliens will end humanity in 30 years.I personally cannot think of any better use of taxpayer money.And then he states as one of the reasons, the Russians have closed their airspace.Uuhh --- I think the Russians would be willing to cooperate with a mission to possibly save all of humanity.How easy is it to fly a privately funded cargo plane full of weapons and soldiers into Russia, blow up an alien spacecraft, kill the aliens, and fly out undetected? Well they do it.I amost turned it off right there. But fortunately the final action scenes were good.Common stupid scifi movie trope - all the military ever uses against the aliens is pistols and machine guns with marginal effectiveness. The military has bigger weapons than pistols and machine guns. If pistols and machine guns are marginally effective, bigger more powerful weapons would be more effective.I give it a 10 for the acting, action, dialogue, special effects, and music. And a 0 for the plot logic. Halfway between 10 and 0 is 5. But the acting, action, dialogue, special effects and music were so good, I'll give it a 6.",The Tomorrow War

Yes, the minority comedy relief character trope is still being abused. Yes, the last half hour is nonsense.All that aside, it's people fighting aliens from the future with lots of heart.

They could just send back all the inventions and discoveries from the future boosting the speed of research and development massively until a point where they could easily kill the aliens when the appear. Of course the question would be, whether we are all living then in branches of a multiverse.The pacing of the movie feels off, too. I got a bit bored here and then.

First of all Visual Effects are just amazing throughout the movie it didn't look like we are seeing a dull vfx at anywhere in the movie it keeps the grip till the end with the hardcore alien Vs human fight and that's the best thing in this movie.Story is not so great but the cinematography and vfx will made up your mind. Chris Pratt is fine not so well doing his job but he's good rest all the actors has done amazingly well. If you find a story in this movie you don't get one but if you wanna enjoy the action scenes, vfx, photography then its worth a try.

318,Paul-271,Terrific Production Values But...,4,8 July 2021,"I remain surprised that any production company that could put together such an eye filling spectacular didn't leave any budget for a writer. Without going into a spoiler, the plot makes no sense. That is, given the nature of the dire issue facing humanity, the solution was right in front of the fools due to the inclusion of time travel.Think on it. There you are in, say, 2050 with a problem you need time to solve. You can travel to 2025 to tell those there of the problemOR you can travel to 2025 and recruit millions to fight in a war that only exists because you don't have time to solve the problem.Along the way we're treated to various tropes as well as worn out scenes such as a departure happening in 3 minutes but the actors take 5 minutes to say good bye. Humans fighting aliens using weapons that work against humans but not aliens. Humans, knowing a dire threat arrives in a few years doing nothing.Meanwhile we're once again transported to the Land of the Woke. All the military commanders are female. The only young romance is multi-racial. When the protagonist needs information about volcanoes to save the world, he bypasses all the geologists and volcanologists on Earth to consult with a black teen whose hobby is volcanos.The worst sin of all - Betty Gilpin is underused.",The Tomorrow War
319,Ansango,An average yet enjoyable ride,6,5 October 2021,"The Tomorrow War is a film with a clever and somewhat original concept and a derivative execution.The creature design is marvellous and those alien creatures are one of the most vicious creatures to ever grace the cinema screen. The visuals are outstanding, especially in the scene where Pratt is leaping forward to save her daughter while she is falling from a platform and all the aliens are leaping towards her from the water. The pacing is good barring the initial 20 or so minutes. Supporting characters are unidimensional but are acted well enough but Chris Pratt and J. K. Simmons are terrific. The action scenes are incredible and well shot. Containing all the chaos amidst its two-time streams, this film is ultimately about the power of familial bonds.Being a serious sci-fi actioner, its attempts at light-hearted moments and funny one-liners are mostly misses. The film lacks in delivery as it derives considerably from films like Aliens to Predators and in between, which is a downer and some glaring plotholes also don't help much.I enjoyed this film and its solid sci-fi action film, it's just that it never made me excited and felt flat and predictable throughout. Sure there were some surprises, but they too weren't neat enough to feel rousing. It was much more than I expected it to be, yet it felt like a dish where something is missing but you can't exactly pinpoint at it. It could have been so much more had the screenplay been a little more polished and the rendering fresher. Ultimately it's bogged down by its bloodshed, lackluster script, drawn out runtime and failure to take leverage of its core idea while procuring generously from its predecessors.",The Tomorrow War
320,chris-j-chuba,Too long to ignore the flaws,4,5 July 2021,"(not a spoiler it's in the trailer) recruiting grandparents as canon fodder is an inefficient use of time travel without doing a couple other things. At least try to use our present day resources to improve advanced weapons and provide intel from the future so we can get the jump on the aliens. The only intel we got was a general location from a casual father / daughter conversation on the very last return jump and one alien tooth from a souvenir hunter.When I say too long, I just described the first half of the movie. Had they ended the movie there I would have rated it higher but instead of tying up the movie at a logical point, they added an expedition to attack the mother ship where the invasion started. This allowed them to drag in the estranged Vietnam dad to pilot an aircraft, 'he's the only one who can do this (gag)'. To explain why I hated part 2 of the movie so much, I have to give some spoilers.* spoilers *
1. Why not tell everyone about the miracle, alien killing, toxin you got from the future, why wouldn't people believe you? Answer: to assemble a rag tag team of misfits, to make an overly dramatic part 2. This is where they should have ended the movie. Mass produced toxin from future changes timeline, we win, I would have increased my rating by at least 2 points. Part 1 had flaws but was entertaining, part 2 went off the rails. You don't have to sneak into Russia. Russia (maybe even Iran) would allow an expedition and even help. In part 1, all of the countries participated in a global draft for the doomed canon fodder plan. Allowing an expedition to eliminate the root cause is much, much lest costly. It was contrived. The same govts which expended trillions of $ on a dumb plan in part 1, now shunned using a trivial amount of resources to stop the root cause. No mass production of toxin, no resources for the expedition (they had to hide requisition) for illegal trip to 'hostile' territory, and this is before they found the alien ship.---------------------------- some good moments
The time travel itself was cool, the limitations were consistent and explained well, and the desperate behavior of the future generation was very believable. The actors struck the perfect tone of grimness.",The Tomorrow War
321,rayres0708,Points for originality.,5,3 July 2021,"I know Amazon hyped this movie up, but I had very low expectations. There were things I loved and things I hated about it.Pros:
Pretty original! Think Timecop meets Aliens?Chris Pratt is funHappy ending (I like my movies tied up nicely)CGI is pretty dang goodCons:
Movie as a whole felt disjointedWho are the sound guys mixing these movies? The action is always too loud and the dialogue too quiet. And no, I'm not a 65 year old woman named Karen. It's an objective fact!They're aliens, but lookout! There's global warming too! This was just an unnecessary political twist.The jokes are pretty lame.I understand the character development that they were trying to facilitate, but there was just too much going on. He feels unimportant, he has daddy issues, Muri has daddy issues, blah blah blah. The conversation on the beach is just painful.So. Many. Plot holes. I know it's a time travel movie and that's not real. But so many questions could have been addressed. Like why the jump error? Why is Dan so unhappy with his job? Why on earth would a super smart scientist bring an alien she knows attracts the other ones to their last base??? Like just take the sample in the field, kill the betch, and get on with it. Amirite?Overall this movie is worth a watch if you want an exciting sci-fi flick that ends well. But don't expect too much or think about it too hard.",The Tomorrow War

There is a wide variety of locations in the movie. The special effects are realistic, especially the aliens. I saw a well-selected acting crew. Christ Pratt and Yvonne Strahovski were awesome in the movie. In general, this is a very nice pick for SCI-FI and action genre fans.",The Tomorrow War
324,FixedYourEnding,Would have worked better as an x-box game,5,18 July 2021,"Man, this movie is stupid with a capital S. Nothing makes sense. The most annoying thing for me, which really annoyed me throughout, is that 500 bullets shot at this animal doesn't seem to bother it as all, but a slit of a knife can kill it. You know the bullet and the knife are made from the same material, right? You know that these guns use magazines that needs to be replenished, right?But this doesn't even begin to scratch the surface of the collection of stupidity that the were able to gobble up into this 2 hour long mindless action flick. Including protecting a serum that other than getting rid of 5-6 monsters didn't do much. I am well capable of ignoring one or two plot holes, but this one combined with time-travel, useless actions and flat characters just make me think this looks like watching my brother plays his x-box. It's fun, but really as a movie it's kind of insulting.Oh, well, I got to watch it for free, and the CGI was decent, so can't complain much, right? Exact score: 48 / 100.",The Tomorrow War
325,rchosen-193-5535,"Not terrible, but not amazing either. Kind of have to let go of any logic to enjoy it.",6,5 July 2021,"I didn't go into this with big expectations. The trailer for it didn't really do much for me.Right off the bat I will tell you do not go into this expecting super deep thinking or expecting mind blowing twists. The plot most times is kind of predictable in what will happen next. This is more of a ""just sit back and have fun"" summer movie in the end.While the acting was fine and it had some very interesting CGI and ""enemies"", the rest of it kind of felt short. Even when ignoring logic, somethings just are hard to ignore. I won't post spoilers but one example of a major ""That is just beyond dumb"" is giving certain kinds of people weapons and somehow they manage to act like elite forces. And you got other issues with some of the scifi elements that aren't really explained well and your just left just having to accept some things work how they work. And for about the first hour of the movie, its a little slow despite a bit of action. But it picks up after that and gets better.It's ashame because with the ""enemies"" aspect, I could have for sure gone for another movie with some deeper lore. But I doubt they really had any given the bare bones brief lore we are shown. The ""enemies"" were well designed and impressive. Though if your into gaming, you see where they got some of their influeces. I would say give it a watch for sure. But if you don't have Netflix, not really worth paying for just to watch it. Again, nothing against the actors or anything, but it's just not mind blowing. Just like many summer movies of the past, you watch it once and likley never watch it again.I'd give it a 7, maybe a 7.5 if I not for one or two moments that were just overly unlogical.

Add complex family dynamics and you have a movie that will engage, grandpa, mom and dad and all the kids.From watching lots of movies, I have a sense of when a movie is closing in on the credits. In this movie, I was stunned, literally, stunned to see, we were just at the half way point. LOL. With a lot of straight to video movies, this would trigger an 'Oh no, not another hour"" response.

-gratuitous and unnecessary plot to create drama, there was no point for him to abandon family, but for the sake of above line he does ...
-political correctness, the lieutenant returning from future is black, the survivalist veteran is black, the clumsy friend is black, the geek kid is black, for one white actor they had to promote two or more black actors...

But just like often is the case, the trailer FAR exceeded the movie. Here's why. The movie had a ton of holes in the continuity. In other words, the REASON behind so much that happened seemed to be completely missing. If you see the movie, you probably will keep asking ""how"" or ""why""? It's not the fact that it's sci fi, but just how this story was written and edited.Effects looked good, and technically it was well made. Pratt is in a ""cookie cutter"" role where he's acting like ""Peter Quill"" (""Star-Lord"" of Guardians). And I love Yvonne (from her days of ""Chuck"", the TV series.. and ""Serena Joy Waterford"" from Handmaid's), but her acting was stilted and editing probably left it feeling this way. J. K. Simmons character (as the dad) gave us NO feeling for the son/father relationship.This movie was lame based on two possibilities: The writing was simply awful, or they edited the snot out of the movie to get it DOWN to 2 hrs 15 minutes.On a 1 - 10 scale, I'd give it about a 4 and suggest you not waste your time.",The Tomorrow War

Black Widow and that Las Vegas zombie movie could've learned something here.The effects were very good throughout, there were a couple of scenes and situations that did feel like something from an Asylum SyFy film.

Actually, after the 1 hour 40 minute mark, it seemed like two different movies. The ending was not that good.....yes....you get your pleasurable ending, but it was just rushed and didn't vibe well with the rest of the movie. I am glad to see Yvonne Strahovski getting some serious air time....she is a great, underrated actress. Chris Pratt was.....well.... Chris Pratt! His acting was not the best, even his comedic one liners. Glad to also see Betty Gilpin, although it was a very small part. The movie was enjoyable.

I am sure it is an Amazing movie and probably worth watching. My ""Rating of a 5"" is only to do to have to have a ""Score"" but also place it where only fanatics of the Movie will read. I am asking a Question to those who may agree with me on the ""SCIENCE"" of the movie. I am sure there is really no way for anyone to answer so if you read this long question then I ask if you agree with me that the movie does NOT fit with the ""Time"" Logic / reasoning (example Star Trek had Flip Smart Phones before Cell was probably even thought of) and is a Fun movie as Fiction/Fantasy then do a Thumbs UP; if you agree it is NOT a true Time Travel Sci Fi movie then Thumbs down on this review. Thanks.All the Reviews appear to state the Future comes to the Present to take warriors into the Future correct?Other SciFi shows often cover that the Future, Past, and Present time lines actually are NOT the Same Correct? (More actual Science to this r/t Time Travel)Terminator and other ""Time Wars"" usually cover People from the Future come to the ""Present"" (Their Past) to fix the Future via fixing the Past where the ""Point that changed the Future"".So, Taking people from the Past (To increase Warrior #s) who do NOT know how to use future Weapons be helpful in the Future? How does this help the future their present? Unless they go to the future for training and them come back to present but then that would like the Bad Guys would do this to pretect the Past from being changed?I can see why people would watch this as a ""Fun Fiction Fantasy with Time Travel"" movie and not something like the Terminator or Orson Wells Book where going in the past to fix the Future. Due to going into the Future to fight would give knowledge that may have caused the problem in the future because when they come back to the Present with that knowledge that those who stayed in the Present before ready for it, would it not have made the Present and Future worse? I probably plan to watch this some day; but probably with the ""It is only Fiction/Fantasy"" and NOT a ""Science Fiction""",The Tomorrow War

Humans need the wrist things just to travel through time, I doubt the humans who're on floating island over here are making new drones/ships/etc. So the past must be sending aid to them somehow other then just people obviously, their guns are prime example of it.Why couldn't you just send the queen back to the past? They could not get to her that way, plus you'd have the research. THE POPULATION and the resources to kill her off killing them off without even needing to find the ship in the first place. I'm sure there would be duplicate on the ship still but it would allow you more time to synthesize the toxin then find them.The way they 'guessed' the ship too was really stupid imo, oh my wife guessed the EXACT yr. It could of been 20-30 yrs back nah its about 2 I just know these things. Plus for some reason the only person who is a volcano expert is some kid at school.

357,flowirin,"temporal paradoxes aside, this movie was bad",4,5 July 2021,"Some times a movie just grips you, suspense builds, and the emotions hit hard.And then there is this. Formulaic pap filling up a good % of the run time, and bad music padding out nonsense scenes that go on and on and on. I ended up skipping forward 20s at a time when the next one hit. Bad actors emoting badly is not really my cup of tea.Also, monsters that go from literal bullet proof death machines into cannon fodder as and when the lead's plot armor requires it is such a tired trope.And then there's the demographic. 13% of the population, and 90% of the cast. The bit where a young black student literally saves the world due to his advanced volcanic knowledge really placed this dire tale firmly in the 'patronising' camp. I'm sure it will be a hit.Perhaps it is hoping to riff of the far superior 'edge of tomorrow'? At any rate, it isn't worth it.Edit. The more I've thought on this film, and its bizzare plot, the more my conspiracy alerts are firing.Essentially the plot is that a dude with daddy issues works with his daughter, with daddy issues, to develop an 'inoculation' against a ""white"" plague that is mindlessly destroying the world, carried here by aliens. The weird demographic representation then ties this into the 'we will announce our plans and get you to cheer them"" category, of NWO dastardly plot.Do we really want to wipe whites from the planet, with an injectable 'cure' that specifically targets females? Given the reports of miscarriage in women at the moment following various popular inoculations?Maybe i'm stretching too far, but then the film has no substance, so my mind needs to fill that void with something... and my scifi plot is better than theirs.",The Tomorrow War
358,verminhater,Glaring failures and abysmal sound quality too..,3,3 July 2021,"First up, just a selection of plot lines I simply couldn't swallow...Despite months to train some conscripts it's decided to send them to battle with zero training. Not even a picture of the enemy is given to them. Despite the aliens being armoured the conscripts are given small calibre arms only. A great piece of military planning. Despite numerous people going back and forth in time not one paradox happens. Despite that finding a way to kill them is vital to human survival only 1 scientist is working on it and prior to only 1 scientist working on it the work was done in an infested area though a much safer area was available. That same scientific work could have been taken to the present day to give them 30 years to work on it but they don't! There are others but it's pointless trying to list them all.On top of that abysmal script we are faced with what seems almost common-place now in that the sound must be so heavily weighted to background noises that simply following a main conversation explaining what plot can be found in the script is impossible. I found myself constantly turning the sound up and then down throughout the movie. It's so bad as to ruin the film and when coupled with the early unbelievable nature of what was happening the film was left with a lot of work to do to redeem itself. A task that was simply too much.Added to that you get the typical casting in that the hero is athletic and rugged whilst the comic relief is fat and the obligatory schmaltz in that the hero is doing it for his child whilst the professional soldiers are off doing crowd control. Please spare me this in future by placing warnings in the blurb that the film is only fit for teenagers. As an adult with a brain I simply don't need this bile.Yet again, as I've had to write so often, the hard bits are done fairly well (the effects and sets plus production values - sound aside) whilst the basics bits such as starting with a decent script are done badly or not at all. I fully appreciate that a scifi movie requires some suspension of reality on the part of the viewer but here I felt treated like a fool in being asked to believe what was happening.

It is one of the few movies lately that isn't trying to make some kind of political statement. It's a flashback to movies 20 years ago where a good guy saves the day against an insurmountable force.The acting was fine, the sound was fine, camera work was fine, CGI was fine. Overall it was a decent way to spend almost 2.5 hours. It didn't feel like it was that long so that should show you it was a decent enough movie to keep you interested. They didn't waste a lot of time with non-entertaining things. I think since the movie was so long they didn't go into how things got to the point they were.

Pratt meets up with his fully grown daughter played by Yvonne Strahovski who is a Colonel and top scientist trying to find a way to rid of the aliens. The movie reminded me of Independence Day meets Starship Troopers. The script was entertaining and fun to the very end.

You spend money on actors, you spend money on CGI, but you give the interns a couple nights round the table with a few beers and pizza hashing out a script ? Thats what it feels like, and this isnt the only movie like this in the Pandemic era.Movie premise is exciting in that i dont think its really been done before, and they do try to explain away the whys and cannots of their time travel, even if unconvincingly.I have never left spoilers in a review before, but this one i just cannot help myself, but will keep it to a minimum.But we have people getting recruited, whether they like it or not, to fight in the future against nasty rip-you-apart aliens. The people who recruit you, decide to take your average day normal people (typically 40 or over) give you a weeks training, then send in a small army of suburbanites who can barely hold a weapon, against an army of nasty teeth gnashing aliens that have already destroyed huge armies in the future (higher tech armies?).That, apparently, is their plan to deal with this futuristic invasion. Instead of course of spending the next 30 years preparing for it, creating weapons and armies to deal with it when it hits, no, they send these ill prepared, ill equipped people hurtling through time. Its just annoying they could not come up with something more intelligent in this story.The movie literally continues in the intelligence insulting category.Like when Pratt is told he was bought to the future for a reason, to help develop a toxin that will kill all the aliens. Hes a high school biology teacher. You can have bought in the worlds foremost exports, but know, you bring a high school teacher.Later they need an expert on volcanoes, the world depends on the accuracy of the information they need to get about this Volcano, so they ask this high school kid (from Pratts class) because he loves Volcanoes.I could go on, but i would ruin the only pleasure you can get from this movie, to laugh at it (not in a good way).I wonder if Chris Pratt, at any time whilst making this movie, thought to himself that this was a huge mistake to be in this movie.",The Tomorrow War
380,nigepitz,This is the future of cinema and the future sucks,2,4 July 2021,"A sort of time travel movie that shows us what big budget cinema will be like in the future. Dumb, inane, badly written, cliched nonsense. It makes absolutely no sense, it's crass, moronic and is intended for people who have IQs of less than 60 or people who've had lobotomies or Americans. In the cesspool of awfulness is a gold nugget of an idea but you have to dig through a lot of crap to find it. A film can do anything it wants as long as it obeys it's own rules but they get themselves in a muddle with the whole time travel thing. It's a clever idea that all the people selected to go to the future will be dead by then, thus avoiding paradoxes but this is ruined by the fact that they completely ignore the consequences of the changed timeline in the present day (or 2022 when it's set) for those who go to the future. The other thing is a horrible trend in big budget movies to remove any jeopardy or anything that might offend someone, somewhere in the world to maximise territory revenue. The result is anodyne, homogenised, broad stroke mess of a film. I love Chris Pratt but here he looks like he read the script and realised it was a turkey but took the paycheck and made a half-assed attempt to go to the gym and buff up.

The writers clearly wanted you to care about the family connection and sacrifice of the soldiers but with under character development it's meh. I'm not even gonna bother telling you what the plot is because who cares? For the last 40mins I was barely paying attention and wanted it to end.

Are they too busy checking off the diversity quotas that they cant figure out how to execute a story? Maybe it's emblematic of how stupid people are getting. I dont know, all I know is they took what should be a foolproof idea and somehow turned it into a clown show.The moronic aspects of this move make it hard to suspend disbelief. I mean it literally starts with time travelers arriving in mass armed to the teeth during the middle of a soccer game and announcing, ""we're you from the future, aliens are slaughtering us, you have to come back with us and (fight) get slaughtered too..."" No joke, that is pretty much verbatim how they introduce the plot.Of course everyone rallies and gladly goes to get massacred. And when I say everyone I mean everyone. The old, young, infirm, obese all get sent forward in time to get massacred. When our hero's turn comes something goes wrong and he, and everyone else, materializes hundreds if not thousands of feet in the air...end of movie you think? No, he lands in a rooftop swimming pool! Apparently six feet of water can break any fall! Visually stunning, intellectually cringe inducing. But wait there's more. About 20 other members of his ""squad"" land in the same pool and all are perfectly fine (and a few seconds laster completely dry) so the movie continues. Seriously, this is so outlandish it's either in there on a dare, or the producers think very little about their audience. The action is often equally as ridiculous, but suffice it to say style over substance is the order of the day.On the plus side it looked good, moved along quickly, and offered a lot of action. Very similar to the Aliens series it adds a dash of ""the thing"" for good measure. Fortunately most of the superficial characters we meet embrace death which allows for a high body count with zero negative emotional impact. So try not to dwell on how stupid it is and enjoy the loud noises.I really am beginning to wonder if they are incapable of making a movie with action that also makes sense, or whether they know most of their bread and butter audience is so dim witted they wont care.",The Tomorrow War

No scenes are dragged or ridden with bad dialogues which by itself is a humongous plus in this era.This film belongs to the category of Edge of Tomorrow, Independence Day etc although it is not as good as the mentioned films.The film does has its own moments in terms of action, emotion and visual treat. The aliens, their social behaviour, the attacks, how they reached earth etc were very convincing, although it did seem out of place that no spikes hit the lead character until it was needed.

If you have a problem with that go watch something set in the present like Doogie Hauser, MD. Chris Pratt's character gets sent to the future to battle bad ass aliens, I mean A LOT of aliens. In the process he runs into a relative and, together, they make a discovery on how to defeat the aliens. The movie has plenty of action and great CGI effects. Part of the solution to defeat the aliens comes from a boy in Pratt's classroom (he is a teacher). That's a nice touch, but some naysayers find that corny - not me. You are not going to leave with some profound message on personal development (this is definitely not Schindler's List), but you will be entertained.",The Tomorrow War

The average person, raising families, working, paying mortgages, raising children are being bombarded in the news by every politically correct movement conceivable today. The Tomorrow War harkened back to the great ENTERTAINING movies of the 90s, something I and many, many people I know are simply starving far. It seems that every new show or movie is ""ripped from the headlines"" political garbage that we get splattered with in the news every day. ""Teachable Moments,"" I believe they are referred to. I and most people just want to pop some pop corn, sit back and watch lots of action and great casts with great lines (none of them about race, sexual preferences, idealistic political ""indoctrination,"" or anything divisive or pushing an agenda. We watch THE NEWS for that).I have watched it twice so far, eschewing the more political and opinionated movies that seem to be proliferating everywhere today. Just simple entertainment with great CGI, a story that takes you away from this ever imploding world. This movie is violent (mostly to ugly aliens), touching, with a happy ending that actually ended instead of leaving us hanging as Hollyweird seems to love doing these days. WAKE UP, you cheap studios spinning out movies with bad, convoluted stories and worse acting. THE TOMORROW WAR hit the exact spot many of us news depressed people who see this country spinning down the drain need. We need MORE movies like this. Not more political tripe we can watch on any one of it seems like hundreds of news outlets. WE WANT, NO NEED, TO BE PURELY ENTERTAINED to be taken out of the world of lies and subterfuge swirling around all politics, all ""Squad"" spewers, and especially the lying media and worse politicians. We want and need more movies like this one! 8 and a half stars rolled up to 10 to combat the haters 1s. Average people have finally gotten a much needed win in this movie. How about more?",The Tomorrow War

But, like a lot of action movies, and Sci-Fi movies, if you start looking to close all sorts plot holes and logic gaps appear.It is largely derivative. You can't help but think of so many other (and often better) sci-fi movies like Aliens, Edge of Tomorrow, A quiet place. Etc. But, there is sufficient action, good CGI, to keep most people engaged and entertained. Most of the characters are underdeveloped, but that's the case with most action movies. There is a fair amount of PC and wokeness, but not enough to destroy the movie.About a thousand times better than Zach Snyder's awful Army of the Dead movie.",The Tomorrow War

The camera-work puts you right in the middle of everything that happens and the notion of dread sends a chill down your spine.There are some glaring plot holes that can be explained, but ambitious script writing has the audience belly-aching for lost immersion for the sake of overblown high-stakes which sadly take a turn for the worse.The comic relief is like nails on a chalkboard at times, but the ride is so wild and wonderful that I'm probably giving more credit than deserving.Just when the movie starts picking up steam in the best way, our protagonist becomes the sole person the fate of the world depends on. Then it doubles down on that theme, then it triples down. It's extremely distracting for the genuine story that should have been told without becoming grandiose fantasmagoric.The ending is especially sweet in a substitute sugar kinda way (that gives your brain cancer).1950's era Disney happily ever after endings are awful, and this one takes everything it has built and turns it into a farce.

404,damorejj,What's worse than dying in a war? Dying in one that never existed!,6,4 August 2021,"If you're wanting pure popcorn action-packed entertainment, this is your movie. If you want a realistic sci-fi flick, you should probably check out something else. This movie is chock full of action, and chock full of plot holes.Where to start..I guess I'll begin with the largest hole of them all. The entire ""war"" was unnecessary. If you develop the ability to travel back in time 30 years, why not use that resource to the best of your ability and put all your energy into trying to find out when these aliens got here! They finally do try to figure that out towards the conclusion of the movie, with absolutely no help from the US government who outright refuse to spend a few thousand dollars of their budget on a flight to Russia, but have no problem spending billions on a war they have no chance at winning, AND sending millions upon millions of untrained people to their deaths, AND putting the world in a state of panic and turmoil for 30 years leading up to the war. It would have made MUCH more sense to go back to 2022 secretly and try to prevent the war without the public knowing. But then alas, you don't have this popcorn action movie.Another plot hole, the people from the future mention that the aliens go into rest once every week, they call it the Sabbath, for a full day, this is when they do their jumps. But when they send the team with Dan (Chris Pratt) and others to 2051, the aliens are fully awake and killing people on the streets. In fact, Dan returns back to 2022 before this Sabbath arrives again. So what was the point of even mentioning it?!? Makes no sense at all.Another hole about the jump into 2051...as they are jumping you hear the team in charge of the jump yell for an abort, as the coordinates are off for their location, leaving Dan and Co to fall about 500 feet out of the sky into a pool on the top of a Miami skyscraper. First of all, they would've all been killed as you cannot fall from that height into a swimming pool and hope to survive. The gravity of the fall will make you hit bottom with lethal force. Others miss the pool entirely and are killed on impact. ---- What was the point of this? The reason behind the failure in the jump is never explained. The aliens didn't cause it. So why is it part of the movie?!? Makes no sense.Yet another plot hole, when the team makes it to Russia and locates the frozen ship of the aliens, they board the craft to find them in hibernation in these glowing pods. The ship literally comes to life as they walk down the corridors. After awakening the beasts by killing a few of them, one escapes into the frozen tundra. So these creatures obviously have no issues with the cold, and their ship seemed to be insulated rather nicely. So why were they going to be sleeping for 30 more years until the ice thawed around the ship? It literally makes no sense.Lastly, one HUGE plot hole. Dan tries desperately to save his daughter in 2051. In tears he refuses to let her die in a war that has no way to win. Yet she gives him the toxin that will kill the creatures to send back with him to 2022. She's going to be alive when he gets there! With the ability to prevent the war!! So why the struggle on leaving his daughter?!? It's ridiculously dumb. AND when he gets back to 2022 and tells them he has a vile that contains a toxin to kill all of the creatures, the soldiers don't even care!! They leave him laying there with the key to all their problems in his hands for him to keep!!Oh and after he fixes everything by killing the aliens before the war can happen (the last one by having a fist fight with it)....the millions of people that died in the war now have died in a war that never existed. That must suck.I can go on and on....but you should get the point. Ridiculousness but entertaining.",The Tomorrow War
405,Tron79,Guardians of the Timeline,5,3 July 2021,"Fun comedic lines couldn't get me past the timeline problems.The problem was that the daughter said that Pratt went to the future in her timeline and came back. When he came back the first time, he would have saved the world. There wasn't a second time. This wasn't the Tom Cruise movie ""The Edge of Tomorrow"", where he gets a do over.I suppose I could have bought that in his daughter's timeline, Pratt wouldn't have gone to the future at all. He may have just left them. But that's not what I remember her saying. I thought I heard her say her dad jumped to the future and came back and then left them. If I heard correctly, that's a major problem. She should have just said that he left them instead of doing time travel. Otherwise, when he came back he would have saved the world. He didn't come back twice...I will need to search for the script and see if I heard correctly. If I did, then this was a huge plot hole.",The Tomorrow War

409,matt_hew,by-and-by chore,5,5 July 2021,The idea that if the future generation sent the previous generation to the future (to die) then the future generation would not exist - was critiqued massively when the trailer came out - and to be fair they covered this off quite well.However the rest of the film is a mess. A Cut N' Paste mash up of other Sci-Fi films with little cohesion and a half baked plot that doesn't make enough sense to be enjoyable.In fact the film being based around time travel and a future war doesn't really work or help the film. From the ridiculous recruitment process and the immediate return (after 7 days) to ignoring the alternate timelines (which is crucial to the idea) and the final act which makes more sense than the main plot (but the powers that be wouldn't / didn't consider) but is clumsily dropped in to wrap up an already overly long movie.Then there's the question of whether there was actually a need for a toxin if they can die normally and why the leading expert on volcanoes is a 10yr old kid......but we'll leave that for tomorrow.,The Tomorrow War

It's well paced and keeps your attention, for the most part It's well acted and the main characters are enjoyable; even if the supporting cast are a little underdeveloped.There is a bit of a question about balance and I sometimes wasn't sure if they were trying to make an action flick or an action comedy.That said, as long as you don't think about it too hard, or go down the rabbit hole of thinking about the time travel paradoxes, you should like this film plenty. If you are looking for a post apocalyptic, sci-fi actioner, and you are OK to kick back and just enjoy it for what it is, you could definitely do a lot, lot worse.The only thing that bothered me more than it should, is how a MacGuffin from the second act (that has been the focus of the film), is actually practically irrelevant in the third act.However outside of that, I really enjoyed this film.",The Tomorrow War

The science isn't real sciency, the aliens aren't particularly unique, and the characters are a bit less than fully developed. But it's all about the action, and the action is first-rate.The pacing leaves no time for brooding or nit picking. I almost didn't watch this movie because it seemed a bit long for the genre, but once the action takes off, it never slows down, and the 140-minute running time passes surprisingly quickly.

I chuckled at the global warming hint, but it was otherwise apolitical. The emotional tug of seeing your daughter in her future form as a hero no one will ever know it's interesting. For me, the two generations of fathers coming together was great! What the main character says at the end of so true about fathers. Perhaps that's why so many don't like this movie? This movie did it right, though time travel is different per movie, I'm glad I saw this one. The action wasn't too much nor over the top. That alien race was pretty awesome!

They literally spent $200 million. Everything else about this movie is top notch, acting, special effects, pacing, etc. But allow me to point out some of the lamer parts of this plot. First and foremost, no attempt at all is made to explain how the time travel was created in the future, it just is, and just barely good enough to work for now. There is one mention of ""we barely have one wormhole open and it is shaky"" and that is it. Like most time travel movies, several basic concepts/alternates get completely ignored. We can communicate with the future, the future KNOWS where the problem originated, so the normal person would quickly conclude that the present should go eliminate the problem at the source NOW. Of course if you do that, it's not much of a movie. Instead, the big plan is to recruit people (who have no other qualification other tha a mysterious quality which is revealed during the film) to the future when the planet is literally overrun with aliens, plus badly equip/train them and give them crap weapons to battle the VERY scary monsters. Egads. Then (of course) they just barely manage to get the crucial weapon developed in the future back to the present and that is when it really goes off the rails, nothing makes any sense from that point on, it is just lame. The cherry on top is at the very end, after the last battle between the two tough guys and the queen alien in the middle of the Siberian tundra, they fall back exhausted (but they DID just literally save every single person on the planet) on the snow and then this third guy who was a long way away just plops down next to them.

This suffers from all the usual problems but the first hour or or so it manages it pretty well. Soldiers from the future spectacularly arrive at a football match and issue a clarion call to their parents to come help fight an alien invasion 30 years in the future. It sounds sappy but it actually works and so a world wide draft ensues which just eats up recruits and the future earth is down to it's 500,000. So of goes Chris Pratt with the next wave of assorted oddballs and meet just the best alien monsters for quite some time. We have gunfights, chases, horrible alien screeching, napalm, the lot, all very Michael Bey. But then we get the techno babble which is utter rubbish, the sappy bonding of dad with grown up future bad ass daughter and the plan to save the world. This is where it should have ended, daughter comes up with alien killing toxin but dies handing it on to grief stricken dad who comes back with the answer to the future invasion. Really, it should have ended there, perfectly good ending, we've had action, scary monsters, bonding, done. But no, we have to have an utterly ridiculous plot of the government not listening, time travel no longer possible, riots at home, so dad puts together a team of survivors from his tour of duty, his estranged dad, a science need and off they go to find a crash landed alien ship and kill the aliens before they get out of cryo sleep; it's as bad as it sounds and frankly ruins a pretty OK movie.Watch with your feet up on the sofa with a beer on a Sunday afternoon but be prepared to be annoyed.",The Tomorrow War
435,TruView,Send In the... Useless Eaters?,3,13 July 2021,"Say you wanted to dispose of a poorly treated, unloved, and even despised segment of the population w/o them being the wiser. Hell if done right, they'd be eager to go! This movie is precisely how you'd do it...provided one had that level of technology. So how would you do it: Essentially, you'd send them to a future war (a Tomorrow war) that would ultimately cease to exist!* A war would inspire many to go and die willingly.* For the recalcitrant, the threat of life-imprisonment (for either themselves or loved ones) will be enough to force their compliance.* When the desired percentage has been eliminated, a neat little trick will be employed that will miraculously bring about the end of the war.* How might I claim with any degree of certainty that this picture takes a swipe at black humanity? Well, the running joke on people of color (and on Afrikan-descended folks specifically) is that they are very often represented by invading armies of zombies, monsters, aliens, and most notably robots. To throw them off this scent, the protagonist nowadays is most often a person of color or in the very least, well within their camp cast as a prominent member of a sort. Consider Will Smith in Bright 2017 and IRobot 2004, or Lawrence Fishbourne in Matrix 1999.Because of the aforementioned, the movie falls flat especially for those who tend to see beyond the facade. Not even the much talked-about star power of Chris Pratt was enough to redeem it from oblivion. Additionally, white movie-goers were presumably not too enthusiastic about seeing a primary cast full of people of Afrikan descent; which incidentally, might have been a contributing factor to its lackluster promotion even to Prime Video members. And if that weren't enough, all but one of the black cast members die in the grand finale.",The Tomorrow War
436,bbevis-47954,Do Not Think During The Tomorrow War,6,4 July 2021,"The Tomorrow War is a throwback sci-fi blockbuster that requires supreme levels of suspension of disbelief. However I did find the Tomorrow War to be entertaining enough to justify the time I spent watching it.Here are some moments that will immediately turn off a lot of viewers who dare spend a minute thinking about anything.The explanation behind time travel.The draft process and the worlds willingness to comply to random people teleporting to a soccer game.What Chris Pratt decides to do with a certain Mcguffin after the second half of the movie.The volcano kid busting out his laptop with exactly what the characters needed.How the characters get to Russia.The final fight.If you read into anything in this movie you will surely be a few of the angry reviewers leaving anything below a 5 at IMDB for The Tomorrow War. However if you can turn your brain off there are some things to enjoy.The creature design/sfx are good enough and it was fun watching the monsters smash through hordes of no plot armor humans. The action sequences reminded me a lot of starship troopers, and it was dumb fun watching everything unfold in the second half of the movie. I also fell for the melodrama in the second half of the movie because I am a big sucker for that kind of sap. JK Simmons is great in the twenty or so minutes of screen time he has. Yvonne Strahovski gives it her all during the emotional moments and there is a cool but cheesy final action sequence.One of the biggest flaws of the movie is Chris Pratt. Chris's performance is on auto pilot and he does a terrible job giving off any authenticity or believable emotion. This is especially true when he needs to act opposite of Strahovski during the films melodramatic moments. Typically Chris is likeable but I wish they would have casted someone else.Also way to waist Betty Gilpin. Betty can act better than most of the actors in this movie and she was sidelined for the supportive wife role. What an absolute waste of her talent and the film probably would have benefitted if Chris Pratts character was killed off and she was made the lead in a surprise twist.Also the tone of the film would have benefitted from being more consistent. The tone is all over the place and I couldn't help of think about better ways the story could have unfolded and how a R rating would have ramped up the intensity.Besides everything working against The Tomorrow War I was able to turn my brain off and allow myself to be entertained throughout most of its runtime.",The Tomorrow War

But I don't understand why IMDb doesn't like it since it is really good.Good things about The Tomorrow War: 1. Great action and CGI. 2. Great acting, especially Chris Pratt, but the other actors are good too. 3. Good plot, storyline, and characters. Normally when a high budget movie isn't great it's usually because the plot and storyline is a mess. But not Tomorrow War. I feel like in The Tomorrow War the makers did put enough time and effort to cover most of the things about the plot. Plus the storyline is amazing.Bad things about The Tomorrow War: 1. The last 1/3 of the movie feels like an extension of the rest of the movie, however the ending was satisfying and climatic.Overall The Tomorrow War is a great movie that I would recommend.",The Tomorrow War

441,TheLegendOfThe42,They should rename this movie to...,2,2 July 2021,"""Phoned In - The Motion Picture"". Everything about this mess seems to be phoned in or first draft/attempt/take. At least I hope it was, because everything else would be even harder to believe than any of the film's idiotic plot points.The script: Terribly silly premise, combining two stupidities at once - time travel and alien invasion. The plot is written by simpletons for simpletons, mixing in the good old ""family"" BS for obvious reasons: the simpletons. The dialogue is incompetent, the humour on par with the plot.The direction: Uninspired, ""borrowing"" from numerous better films and without any detectable style.The acting: Phoned in to half decent performances. Most of the actors tried to do something with the terrible material, but to no avail.The visuals: One half-interesting shot for every 200 uninspired, tired, CG-dripping shots. The VFX are all over the place - some decent, some atrocious. The editing was fitting the rest.The music: Godawful, generic simpleton score. I first thought it must have been hacked into the MIDI editor by Pinar Toprak or Junkie XL, but no., there's another hack in town: Lorne Balfe. This score is literally indistinguishable from a million ""epic"" pieces on various websites like envato. Only for a thousand times more money, I guess.I just read that Amazon bought this movie for 200 million dollars. I don't know about you, but I think this is one of the symptoms of our failing civilization. This is not a Tomorrow War, this war is happening right now, and it's stupidity's war on talent and brains. And since time machines are impossible in real life, stupidity is going to win. It's already winning.",The Tomorrow War

This serves as an effective method in displaying an engaging story. The film plays it safe by covering bases to deliver a decent plot. Those bases includes some logical pieces such as a realistic government, intense action scenes, they tried some comical relief ( it didn't work) and they attempted to add an emotional appeal for the protagonist.Although the comical relief was subpar, the idea was engaging enough for me to enjoy the movie. The impossible was made possible.Verdict:If you have Amazon prime, watch it! No need to erupt like a volcano to catch this movie but it is decent and played it very safe. Also it is 2 hours long so prepare yourself. I watched it over two days.",The Tomorrow War

445,Crankgorilla,Pratt is the villain (or should have been),4,3 July 2021,"Superficial characters and American diversity and social engineering flood the screen in this stinker. It's Chris Pratt playing himself again as he tries to emulate what the writers think women want. One interesting missed opportunity was Pratt finding the ship at the end. That should have been the twist. He released, or woke the aliens and started the whole thing. That should have been the plot. Instead they blow the whole ship and end doomsday. It would have made sense and tied into why he became withdrawn and left his family then died a few years later etc. He started the whole thing by going out his own. Pratt released the dormant aliens. That would have been interesting. It almost looked like that's what they were originally going to do? But instead they went for the standard happy ending. Wasted opportunity to really mess with the audience and make an average film into something memorable.",The Tomorrow War
446,deanocware,Could of liked it more,6,2 July 2021,"I really wanted to like the tomorrow war with Chris Pratt and after seeing the trailer I was very excited to see this movie. However despite some decent visuals the movie simply never climaxed or gave me the experience I was hoping to get out of it. First of all we see very little of The war and a great majority of the film is simply dialogue's and locations. However what really destroyed my suspension of unbelief was all of the plot holes in the story. In fact it seems like there were so many that they simply gave up on trying to even maintain any consistency whatsoever. First of all The writer would have you believe that Chris Pratt and his wife are the first two human beings to figure out that the aliens that they are fighting in the future could have actually of arrived on earth much earlier. Secondly when they need a top scientist to explain how volcanic ash was found on the claw of an alien from the future the only one they can thing to go to is a high school kid. Third when Chris Pratt character tells the Defense Secretary what he has learned in the future that can defeat the aliens the defense secretary indicates he cannot authorize a mission that might save all human kind with ""taxpayer dollars"". Finally, the movie seems to have this big happy ending with Chris Pratt saying he is not going to leave his family but apparently forgets that previously they indicated that he dies seven years in the future. This of course would change the future which apparently they indicated earlier in the film they could not do and which is why only people who had already died could go and fight the aliens in the future and only young people who had not been born yet could come back in the past and recruit them. So like I said it seems like at some point they just gave up and said they didn't care anymore about any kind of internal consistency. However all of that could be forgiven if it was an exciting in a tense sci-fi alien thriller. Unfortunately it was not the aliens are not particularly scary and while the extras in the movie can never seem to kill one alien no matter how many bullets they fire the main characters somehow can always survive huge packs of them and take one down at just the right moment. If you are looking for a new aliens or predator franchise I regret to tell you this is not it. Instead think Battle for Los Angeles with a futuristic twist.",The Tomorrow War

I fully understand that movies are not filmed start to finish (been involved in a few), but at key points in the creation of a movie there neeeds to be ongoing reviews of the 'direction' the movie is now going - they never go according to plan - ever.

Cons First
-They couldn't make up their mind if time was only linear, or if different branches made an alternate timeline.-They also couldn't decide if they were going for dark and serious or fun/action like avengers
-Sam Richardson (whom i normally enjoy), was wasted with this script, as the comedic relief.-Jasmine Matthews who plays a bad@$$ LT. HART was not given any finale. Are you saying the highest ranking person to come back in time to recruit wasnt given a cool ending? C'mon movie!-They mention the first attack wouldnt be for a year, but they rush to put this ""rag tag"" group together for the final showdown. I feel like with their credentials they couldn't got at least one politician to help their cause.Pros
-The wife not only supported him and understood Dan's PTSD, but specifically worked with other people to help them. The whole scene after he comes home pretty shaken, she is supportive, and listens to him, then works out a game plan . Big Cliché dodge.-His daughter wasnt mad at him for leaving that first time. Another big cliche dodge.-Nora and Cowen (the two ""civilians"" with the initial group was given a pretty awesome ending. Holding the aliens off, while the epic music score comes in.-simply all the action was done pretty darn well. Good stuffFinal thoughts -

Good news there is going to be one!The tomorrow was doesn't have the most original or the strongest storyline as it's basically Aliens + Timetravel.

Especially Chris Pratt and Yvonne(Future Muri).The soundtrack wasn't anything to special but was still pretty good. The sound effects and dialogue thou was all really good and well done!One of the best parts of the film was that after about 1h30m or so I thought the movie was basically over and while it had been enjoyable it wasn't mind blowing or anything but still left me wanting a number two... however when I looked at how much of the movie was left I was surprised to see another good hour or so to go still.

478,warren-87235,90's Style Action Adventure Excitement!,9,15 July 2021,"'The Tomorrow War' is just outright fun. Sure, it has some glaring plot holes, but no more so than your average big fun blockbuster (And less than most Marvel movies). It's the type of movie that can sit alongside the likes of Independence Day, Waterworld or Pacific Rim as fun, over-the-top action adventure with a little heart.It's probably a solid 8, but it deserves an extra star just for daring to be this kind of film in today's Hollywood. There is no agenda, no politics, no preaching. It's an heroic adventure of heroes fighting to save the world and those they love. What more could you ask for in a summer blockbuster?That's not to say it's without its flaws, which we'll get out of the way... First, the elephant in the room... Time Travel. There are two options: 1) A single timeline, in which past events affect future events. This clearly doesn't work, with The Tomorrow War. Or 2) Divergent timelines, where as soon as you go back, you're effectively creating a new branch that doesn't lead to the same future the time travellers left. The only way The Tomorrow War makes _any_ sense, is if you take option 2, if the first travellers came back and _maintained_ that link in some way. In which case, the goal of those in the movie's 'present' is to help not only an alternate timeline, but prove to ourselves that we can survive the events in ours, when they finally occur. It's possible this was covered briefly, but if so, it certainly wasn't clear. I'll have to re-watch some time.Another big plot hole is the claim in the future, that they only had the materials to create one time travel device that maintains this link. Yet they can send materials and people from our time. So there's no reason why more equipment and devices couldn't be sent through. Although if we follow the logic of time travel option 2, you could argue that once the link had been established, further devices would be pointless, as they would only link to _other_ branched timelines, which would be created for each device.The last big plot hole was the excuse for not killing the 'Queen' after things go south. The excuse was that they didn't want to waste the potentially deadly serum they had just discovered, but why not just shoot her? Or throw a grenade at her? Secondly, given the knowledge of how she can call her offspring, why not simply damage her ability to make sound, and chop off limbs/tails to stop her being a threat, immediately after capture? Then you can continue to experiment without risk. Or at least without obvious risk, and then establish a reason that her offspring arrived that the heroes couldn't have thought of.Those are the major issues. Sure, there are a few other lesser offences to story and logic, but overall they're not a big deal. Given the type of action adventure movie it is, none of this really ruins the fun. It's no worse than Independence Day's handy computer virus, or asking why the Terminator movies never sent weapons wrapped in defeated-terminator flesh, to accompany their soldiers.Chris Pratt straddles the role of everyman hero (who is handily ex-military) well. There's a good balance of light hearted adventure alongside the character drama and building. You _want_ these characters to succeed, unlike so many other recent action movies that leave you not caring.Yvonne Strahovski steals the show (And that's not to take anything away from Pratt). It's great to see her back in action again, after her gun-toting, adventuring days in Chuck.Overall the story is a melting pot of Terminator, Aliens, Starship Troopers and The Thing. It's not particularly original, but it does it well, and with such gusto that you can't help but be carried away with the fun and excitement.Is it the greatest action sci-fi movie ever made? No, but it delivers some pulse-pounding adventure with characters you care about, a healthy dose of humour that doesn't spoil the drama, and it'll leave you with a big satisfied grin.",The Tomorrow War

World War Z
I Am Legend
TransformersThe combination of Chris Pratt and the fact that there have been no big expensive movies on the market for almost two years (not counting Tenet) made me watch this. If you like action movies in general (Fast and Furious, Terminator, Transformers, Statham films, Alita) and can make yourself not care for the writing, I will go on and say that you will probably like that one too. If you fall into that category just stop reading right here and add it to your watchlist, because I am about to start dismembering this film.'The Tomorrow War' is your typical action movie featuring a man on a mission, with an icing of future technology and creepy aliens on top. The story is structured a lot more like a videogame rather than a film (similar to Dead Space/Alien Isolation/Mass Effect) and has more horror elements to it like some of the big zombie pandemic movies out there. As it often is in those big films, the expensive action scenes are interspersed with chunks of borderline pathetic drama, trying to establish a personal connection with the main character that never really works if you're paying at least some attention to the miserable dialogues and acting. Even that is sometimes okay, I mean Transformers are still watchable even though you know that the overwhelming majority of scenes where robots aren't involved is going to be awful. However, in this particular film even the action scenes did not save it, it was painfully worse than usual, to the point that it actually made me angry; because I just love Chris Pratt with passion. He is like the coolest uncle we've never had, a hilarious ball of positivity who is the same in real life as he is on the screen; and to discover that he is actually terrible at dramatic acting once he stops trying to be funny was very unexpected and sad. This applies to everyone in the film except for Yvonne Strahovski who did a great job; any family interaction or a 'meaningful' pretentious dialogue within the film is unbelievably cringe beyond tolerable.Among it's few advantages are the general idea on which the film was built, and the fact that I did at least have a couple of laughs while watching it; props to the guy who wrote some decent jokes into the script. I will also mention that there were cool little details in the scenes involving the military which made the film more realistic; like the fact that they don't yell at each other but talk over comms while on a helicopter (and probably some other things that I just didn't notice). But man, the rest of the writing was just awful. The film also should have ended 30 minutes earlier than it did; there is basically a short sequel at the end of it that was simply unnecessary.",The Tomorrow War

486,tarekali-19909,The Tomorrow War is a grade-A contender,8,6 July 2021,"Movies from Streaming studios have a reputation of B quality, but The Tomorrow War is a grade-A contender. The action is breathtaking and whiplash-inducing, in between quieter moments. The time travel dimension echoes Edge of Tomorrow but on a far less iterative scale. There are even parallels to religious texts and the themes of ancient evils waiting to emerge.The creature design of the 'spikes' is somewhat unique and terrifying, even though it's clear there is an amalgamation of other beasts. It's hard to come up with truly unique forms after the age of HR Giger and Stan Winston. There are certainly inspirations from the Alien series, especially the original from Ridley Scott. Despite all these influences, this movie stands on its own as a formidable action outing.Chris Pratt is comfortable in his Jurassic World role as a fearless protagonist who wants to do the right thing, especially for his daughter. We can't expect great depth from him, his range is limited but adequate.I was surprised instead by the performance of Yvonne Strahovski, who often gets relegated to B movies as a supporting cast. Here instead she rose to the occasion and portrayed a tough leader with great emotional depth and nuance.JK Simmons stole the show in the end, with his caustic abrasive and absolutely genius jaded veteran role. There was an action scene where he demonstrated brain over brawn in combat, and I clapped out loud.We should never underplay the sacrifice of common people when faced with a global threat of complete annihilation. The bravery of the supporting cast was well appreciated in the face of certain death.Amazon made a great action movie that is definitely worth the 2 hours.

If you're looking for Jurassic World/Guardians of the Galaxy Chris Pratt, sorry, this is thinking about the house he just bought with the money Chris Pratt. The writer had a three year old's understanding of temporal physics. The script basically thumbs it's nose at the whole grandfather paradox as millions of grandfathers and grandmothers are wiped out forever changing the future they supposedly came to save. I can;t comment on the overall story since I was so excited I fell asleep a little over halfway through but I did wake up just in time for the end and I can say the ending may be the worst part. Definitely some of the worst dialogue.The streaming services are just cranking out content with zero consideration for whether it's any good or bad. I used to protest when I saw something like this one and canceled my subscription. No one cares so there's no point. The old studio system made some great movies. The streaming services are the new studio system and they crank out dollars, not movies. I hope the house you bought is nice Chris because the movie sucks.

It is not supposed to be realistic, and I do believe it to be self aware of that. But, all the complaints of plot holes is undeserved IMO. Time travel movies cannot be written without things that don't make sense, because there is no such thing as backwards time travel. Period. Well, technically there's not forward time travel, either, just relativity. Keeping that in mind, I actually thought the writing was pretty well done, given the premise. And, the time travel aspect was thought provoking. (Did the people who died in the future still die in the present? I think yes, so it makes their deaths worthwhile, too.)But, as a woman, I just get so tired of the toxic male protagonist with daddy issues. Yes, we know how important male pride is, and don't need to be reminded of it during our down time, too. Pratt's character was better than some. There were a couple female characters who were heroic and honorable, too, not big wusses or trophy wife types. So, that was good. But, I can't in my heart give this better than a 6 for the placating to male dominance. You can do stories about men that don't make them so emotionally fragile and stunted.

511,JoelAlexanderr,A thrilling sci-fi/action film with little pretense,8,12 July 2021,"I don't understand the hate for THE TOMORROW WAR. From start to finish, it's an engaging and thrilling science-fiction epic with a charismatic lead performance from Chris Pratt. The concept is original and thought-provoking (what if soldiers from the future traveled back to present day to warn us of the end of the human race?), and the action sequences are all well-shot and a joy to watch.The movie starts by building Pratt's relationship with his wife and daughter, and because the writer and director do such an excellent job at building these characters, the movie has incredible stakes throughout. Once the action begins with bullets flying and aliens killing, the grand million-dollar scenes never feel unearned or anything less than necessary. The first major action scene, in which Pratt and a squad of soldiers must attempt to extract a team from a Miami research building, is a tense and explosion-heavy scene with an excellent score from Lorne Balfe and some immaculate visual effects. Basically every action scene is similar, with grand and beautiful set-pieces and investment in the characters never faltering.My problems with the movie all lie in the last 30 minutes, all of which feels like an afterthought to the previous two hours. The story is still very strong and the action is still well-shot, but once the last CGI-filled monster sequence started, I couldn't help but think that the movie had overstayed its welcome. With that being said, THE TOMORROW WAR is a fantastic sci-fi film that deserved a theatrical run more than almost any other movie so far this year.

It's full of them...Time travel movies have to find a good way of solving the paradox of people going into the past without changing the future - this movie does not take into account any of these consequences. It would be really easy to build up an enormous arsenal in the present, to prepare for the invasion. It would also be easy to nuke the area where the creatures first appear - especially considering that humanity would otherwise be facing extinction. The military in this movie are moronic and lazy beyond belief - they do not plan for the future, they do not train citizen soldiers, they do not try to eradicate the very first creatures... The whole mechanism of the ""one week trip"" is laughably lazy and looks like a cheap plot trick.A few hundred thousand dollars spent on screen doctoring could have fixed the plot holes and made the movie a way better experience.This being said, the creature design and special effects are amazing - no expense was spared.

The acting was mostly good, I've loved Yvonne Strahovksi since _Chuck_, she did a great job. Some of the pieces of the story were good, but overall, too much of it didn't make sense.The basic idea is that someone in the future invents a wormhole-based time displacement device, so they can go 30 years back in time and try to save the world from destruction by ravenous and highly energetic alien creatures. They liken their device to two rafts in time, 30 years apart, but still both moving forward in time. You can go between those two rafts, but not to any other time.****SPOILERS****The problems arise near the end. People in the future develop a toxin to kill the aliens and send it back with Pratt to kill the aliens before they even start their destruction. When he gets back, he somehow forgets what he was supposed to do, and for some reason wants to develop more of the toxin and then go back to the future to use it on the aliens.He's supposed to be really a really smart scientist, so it makes no sense that he can't even remember what the developer of the toxin told him to do. It also makes no sense that the the people who are running the Tomorrow War don't understand this either, they they can just make tons of the toxin and destroy these creatures at their leisure.Pratt ends up with a ""rag tag"" crew who are going to find the alien spacecraft in a Siberian glacier. They are told to ""spread out"" and then race across the glacier on snowmobiles in tight formation. Nevertheless, they find an ice crater that's probably where the spaceship is, and right away they blow it open, at the risk of giving the aliens a 30 year head start in devouring all life on Earth.And Pratt is supposed to be a very smart scientist! After they blow it open, they find the outer hull of the ship and Pratt gives them the option of taking the info and location back to the UN, or try to destroy them on their own. Of course, hurr durr, they decide government is totally incompetent, and proceed to enter the ship.They have no idea what's going on in the ship, or if all these ravenous aliens will jump right out as soon as they open it up, but in they go. Without any planning or forethought, they proceed to inject a few of the aliens with the toxin, and the aliens die, but it wakes up all the other aliens. Again they've risked the nightmare scenario of unleashing this horror on the world 30 years early.But fortunately in his spare time one of the crew rigged the ship with at least a couple of tons of C4, and he blows it up. No one on screen wonders why they didn't just do that before waking up all the aliens. And of course the queen alien escapes, and they have to go kill her, because if they don't the destruction of the Earth will start now instead of 30 years from now.You're probably wondering, if they had 30 years, why didn't they use all that time to develop some kind of fool proof plan to destroy the aliens? That's what I'm talking about!",The Tomorrow War

Tell your brain, ""ok dude, just relax and stop asking obvious questions"".Once you are dangerously close to the brain death, enjoy the popcorn.After watching the movie, you can take a look to the reviews to find a summary of plot holes, inconsistencies, unresolved questions and nonsense. I realized that this movie is like p0rn: the plot is not the goal and no matter how silly is it. The goal is the action. The plot is an excuse for cool war action, using a lot of ammo, explosions behind you, killing scary aliens, deaths in slow motion and having fun.Anyway, an entertaining flick for a Sunday afternoon.Spolier:There is an extremely realistic scene in the movie though: that moment in which a bureaucrat of the government say ""nay"" to fund and support a scientific expedition to find the alien' spaceship and save the world. As a scientist, I lived a lot of times that moment in which a bureaucrat makes you a lot of ridiculous excuses to not fund your project.",The Tomorrow War

You can hire the best CGI team in the business and still that won't beat a proper writer. The CGI is quite good, acting with some highlights, but mostly just mediocre, the build-up of tensions as generic and boring as It can be. The plot, just plain stupid. It's so obvious that they just thought, well, If we blow It up with kick-ass CGI I'm sure our stupid audience won't notice It, because they will say It was entertaining. Well ... for me It wasn't. A waste of time. 5 points for the effort -2 points for thinking we're mindless zombies who wouldn't notice the horrible plot holes which tears down the whole experience.Really I rather than watch a B-movie with crappy CGI/effects but with a proper plot.",The Tomorrow War

Though I think the writers could have made their origin story more original and not similar to one in an old film. I'm not sure why this movie got so many negative reviews. Granted, there are plot holes, goofs and plot inconsistencies. But the same people and critics giving this movie bad reviews.

The story is flat and predictable; the characters stereotypical and forgettable. Overall it's a consumeristic package, designed to generate profit without leaving a mark. It's a safe play, with a hero saving the world and the mandatory family drama. I would consider it more an action movie with a sci-fi element thrown in to give it characterization than a sci-fi movie with a few action scenes. I don't think there's any replay value which truly marks this as an experience barely worth your time.

Like similar films, including Ryan Reynolds' 6 Underground or Chris Hemsworth's Extraction, there's no flaw in cinematic quality, but probably wouldn't have been that memorable without the principal cast headliners.As a fan of apocalyspe / dooms day films like, Into the Storm, Greenland, San Andreas and 2012, this definitely gets a replay on the watchlist.Comedic moments are provided by sidekick, Charlie (Sam Richardson) but for the most part, the supporting cast are a little underdeveloped. Unexplored and hollow backstory like for instance, Dorian (Edwin Hodge) who we meet having served on two missions seems to have a death wish while collecting war souvenirs served no real purpose to the story.

It didn't really seem like my cup of tea, but I was assured it would be a fun and fairly mindless callback to the classic sci-fi flicks of yesteryear. Boy was I misinformed.I'm not sure how they managed to make a massive budget ($200 million dollars!), explosive sci-fi film about a future alien war so awfully dull, but my goodness did they do it.I have to say that the alien designs and effects were really good (probably some of my favourite since Starship Troopers) but unfortunately I can't save that sort of praise for much else in the film. The characters weren't particularly interesting making it hard to feel any sort of connection when the film tried to pull off some more emotional moments, or just be invested in the plot in general. Chris Pratt just didn't work for me as a likeable or convincing lead for this, and what a waste of a talent like JK Simmons. I thought the concept of the film was fairly interesting, but it was far too dragged out. There's no justification for this film to be well over 2 hours long.Essentially you can think of The Tomorrow War as a cross between Edge of Tomorrow and Independence Day, but with the result being an overly long and tedious film that is nowhere near as good or entertaining as either. I wouldn't waste my time with it.",The Tomorrow War

But then, however, absolutely all common sense is thrown out the window with the return from the future. Absolutely nothing in the second part follows any kind of logic. This is to the extent that it rips you jarringly from the fantasy of the movie over and over again. Without spoiling anything, I will say there is a simple and clear path to victory over the threat, and absolutely no one acts on it. This would have been better if they threw in another action battle scene or 2 early on, and ended it with the return from the future, with the obvious solution immediately acted upon. But instead you get just a big mess of unnecessary stupidity to finish up the movie. The people who made this just didn't care. There is no other explanation.

I guess because the characters jump in time in the movie, the writers took some liberties with jumping the script around in time too. There's a bit of genre identity crisis happening as well where the movie is stuck between a dramedy and a sci-fi action flick.Overall, the film was entertaining and is definitely worth watching on a big screen with a good sound system.

Every potential flaw I imagined during the movie was cleared up by the end. Great character development and growth and some interesting, if not entirely lovable characters.This is one of the rare movies worth seeing multiple times -- the type which keeps getting better no matter how many times you see it. Art works on numerous levels and this was a most skillfully woven story. Kudos to the writers, actors, director and everyone else on this project.I hope you keep creating more like this. Heroic, positive and inspiring.ADDENDUM:
After reading other reviews, I wondered what were the ""huge plot holes"" that others saw? I consider myself a relatively intelligent guy. I've written a few screenplays. I know of many of the difficulties. I've studied computer science, so I understand logic, even earning a degree, summa cum laude. So, where are the damned ""plot holes?""I'm beginning to think that either the reviewers lack sufficient smarts to understand a really sexy science fiction story, or have ulterior motives for trashing what is a writer's inspiration. And after writing nearly 100 books (mostly for paying clients), but one #1 Weather Bestseller of my own, I think I can tell a good story from a bad one.Case in point: When on the mission to capture a live female whitespike, Muri tells her Dad that the aliens have no use for technology. That's a potential plot hole. How in heck did they get to Earth if they are aliens who don't even use technology? And the writer solves this beautifully. One of my favorite lines is in the alien ship where Chris Pratt's character (the lead) says that the whitespike cargo are ready to breed like ""planet-clearing weapons."" And that's exactly the effect they had on Earth's Tomorrow War.Kudos to Zach Dean for tying up this and other really thorny plot elements very nicely.",The Tomorrow War

553,gelmcchristop,Lacking story. Great movie.,8,16 August 2021,"Unfortunately, The Tomorrow War fails where any movie has to succeed: the script. The structuring of the plot is the biggest concern, in that there always is an overflowing amount of information for such an action-packed movie. Secondly the final motive is essentially revealed after the 2/3rds of the movie, making the first part of the runtime somewhat ambiguous and tiring, as the audience is watching mayhem going on without the characters seemingly doing something in particular. Finally there appears to be a significant amount of plot holes, and the admittedly sequel-worthy plot twist in the end actually harms the immersion which had been built up through the successful attempts at realism the writers put in this rather crazy scenario. But with all the plot rant out of the way it's time to discuss the merits of one of the most striking cinematic experiences.The cinematography is straight up brilliant. Lots of daylight, mainly sunsets, brightening up the screen and allowing the audience to appreciate the beautiful environment art as well as the freaky creatures to the maximum. The sparks, the lens flares, the smoke, the god rays are persistently tied together to develop a consistent cinematic look and feel. The VFX houses deserve a hats-off too. Organic, despicable creatures may seem as a habitual effect these days, however a squad facing a 10-foot-tall monster and tearing its flesh apart as they attempt to captivate it dragging it with metal wires is only one of the indicators of the hard work the crew put into bringing the excellent concept art to life. Plus man cannot but respect the attempt to pay a tribute to H. R.

So he just gets his estranged civilian dad to get him, a team of soldiers, and all their weapons and equipment there. No problem. And apparently no problem getting back either.

Why send thousands of people back to be slaughtered by aliens as they try to use bullets to kill them? Perhaps the final thing the people from the future should have announced in that football stadium is: ""...and by the way, bullets are not an effective way to kill them!"" They could have spent 30 years coming up with a solution.This barely kept me engaged - some of the scenes looked good. The aliens design was good - if similar to others...

562,alexleizerovichcoaching,Rough on the edges but a good watch,7,2 July 2021,"It was a good 2 hours watch, but could be better if not 2 weird plot holes.The good:
-The aliens are very intense and scary. I watched many fantasy movies and by now I never see scary aliens/monsters in movies anymore. It's becoming normal when you have them in so many movies. In here they managed to give them a bit of a different look and vicious strength.-The movie is full of action and although its more than 2 hours its easy to watch.-The story is pretty interesting. There is a war 30 years in the future and couple soldiers go back to the past to seek for help.The bad:
-My biggest problem with the story is the way the humanity handles it at the beginning. So once the soldiers from the future come they assemble a huge military force. And send to the future to fight the aliens. Only 20% of them make it back. Then for a whole year they start to send untrained, out of shape civilians, that are over 40 years old(they even send scientists, engineers etc). They just give them a few hours of basic shooting training and thats it. Now these aliens are super strong, they attack by the thousands and it takes many rounds to kill one. There is no sense whatsoever in sending people that dont have much fighting value against these aliens. This was hard not to think about.At some point when he meets his daughter in the future shes working on a toxin that might kill them. Why not think about it from the begging? I mean instead of sending all your military and civilians to be killed just send a recon mission. Go back and use your 30 years to create a toxin.-At the end when they find the space ship and see the aliens sleeping they inject only some of them and the others wake up. They know how strong they are it doesnt make sense to take such a stupid risk. Inject them all together or call reinforcement. This felt like a sloppy writing too but not as big as the first plot hole.-There isnt much character development in here. But I guess they wanted to make action oriented.Anyways I enjoyed this movie but it could be much better.",The Tomorrow War

That aspect of the movie was okay. But rather, the clichéd tropes, attempted comedy, score, etc. All seemed dull and tedious. The type that had already been done numerous times before.Just picture a Transformers level movie (the sequels and beyond), but with alien aliens instead of robot aliens. And that's because of the overbearing use of inspirational scores, good guys always coming out on top, lame attempts at comedy, and so on.Plot was okay'ish. Had somewhat of a decent concept.

So, in a last ditch effort to win the war, the people of the future go back in time to recruit people from the past to help in the fight to save humanity.Now, everyone knows that introducing time travel to a plot is always going to cause problems, there are just too many contradictions and anomalies. For example, if someone from the future goes into the past to tell someone to stop a specific event then the event doesn't happen. But that means no one comes back from the future to tell someone to stop a specific event, which means the event will occur. That means someone from the future has to go back in time to tell someone to stop a blah blah blah.... And so it goes, ad infinitum. You see the problem.But this film doesn't care.

It appeared to have a soldier like Chris Pratt staring me down as if to say ""watch this movie"". The movie is called ""The Tomorrow War"". The premise is simple, people from a losing war in the future come back in time to tell humanity to go and die fighting aliens in that future. Maybe that isn't so simple, though the writers would really like it to be, In fact they would really like it if you didn't think much at all about it. This is one of those movies that just pulling one logic thread will completely unravel the entire thing. But it does have some great visual effects, action set pieces, sound editing, and one incredibly ripped J.k. Simmons. Those things are typically enough to give the movie a shot alone, if those are things your into. I am and those elements were fun. I also enjoyed a scene in which Yvonne Strahovoski tearfully explains her history, although it does come in a terrible location that had me yelling ""is this safe!?"" At the screen. Strangely enough it's Chris Pratt who I have a hard time believing in the lead role and most of that is due to his character being riddled with plot convenience. Everything is tied to this character and every thing he does is either never dealt with or is great for him.

Chris Pratt is a great actor but this plot, script, etc was very poor, so it begs the question- why did this movie get the thumbs up to get made? It could have been salvaged with a much better plot and script. But the committee whose job it was to approve this story failed big time. Another reviewer said it was like Sharknado. Yep, I agree.",The Tomorrow War

We just want it not to be so obvious...If not for Chris Pratt this movie would be unwatchable, but Chris makes things watchable even if the plot makes no sense, characters act like idiots, time travel paradoxes stack up to the roof, and the writing is obvious and cliche. Which it is, but it's okay, because Chris Pratt.I watched the whole thing, while complaining about the above. Also it has some pretty good action, explosions, and monsters.

572,davidjkobb,A Muddled Climate Change Allegory,6,9 July 2021,"There's good and bad to The Tomorrow War. While being 2 hours, it still lacks in character development for nearly all of the characters. The dialogue is also weak. The action is fine, but in a couple of places it is difficult to maintain a suspension of disbelief.A weird side note: why do Chris and Yvonne's hair change color half-way through the movie? Watch, and you'll notice both of their hair colors get noticeably darker. Not a big deal, but strange none-the-less.The movie is a muddled climate change allegory, with direct illusions to the crisis in the posters behind Pratt's character when he's in the classroom. The problem is it loses the allegorical plot for large chunks of the movie.",The Tomorrow War

Well to be honest, the first half of this movie was 8-9 star material. It was very exciting, the action was really well done and the concept was pretty decent. It wasn't till the second half that things got stupid. Lots of plot holes, 1/3 of the movie dedicated to making something that had little to no significance later in the film, and the last 30 minutes just felt like an add on to the movie. However, the ending does conclude the story well enough.Overall rating: 5.7.",The Tomorrow War

Chris Pratt's character says that, in one of the first scenes of the movie.I really wish the writers, or the producers, or the director - or ANYONE - connected with this production, truly believed that.Clearly they don't, because none of them apparently understand the concept of time.The whole premise of this movie is time travel - but it is done so badly, that it makes you laugh out loud, at the sheer stupidity of the whole thing.It's not the cool kind of time travel, were you go to the past to change history, or go to the future to learn things and bring them back - oh no - not in this movie.Instead you sit there, for just shy of 2 hours, constantly thinking ""why are these people time travelling to a war 30 years in the future, instead of staying and spending 30 years preparing for it?""It makes absolutely NO sense - it's simply dumb - there is no other word for it.You have to be either a kid - or mentally challenged - to enjoy the otherwise well made action and the well made CGI, with the giant plot hole staring you in the face throughout the movie.I'm sorry, but the most this can get, is 2 points - and that is from someone who loves both Chris Pratt and big action movies.",The Tomorrow War

Oh....and give your brains a couple of hours off too, they won't be needed but that is not a bad thing.This is exactly what I could have done with during the Lockdowns last year. I whipped through all my favourite sci fi movies in Lockdown 1 (UK) and pretty quickly starting watching some low budget random stuff. On occasion I found a hidden gem, but too often a rushed, unfinished load of twaddle with a fag packet script.TWT production quality is excellent and had be craving to see this in the Cinema with belly wobbling sound. This is my one regret watching it as I did on my home system.A Sci fi film asks you to suspend belief and creates a new world to tell you a story, whether that be action, thriller, horror etc. A good sci fi movie then entertains you whilst not breaking all it's own rules, this didn't.Christ Pratt is well, Chris Pratt, I didn't expect oscar winning performance but if you like him, you like him. Supporting cast was more than adequate. The visual effects though, top notch, near faultless. The script didn't have any cringe moments, which again is quite a feat in an action sci fi movie.I could go on, but I'll end with this. If you enjoyed Live, Die, Repeat.

First of all don't believe the bad comments this movie really is a top production. See it for your self before you judge it!I wish I saw this in the cinemas. I had goosebumps for two hours watching it and didn't want the movie to end sure it's a bit cheesy at the end but otherwise it's the best movie I've seen in years.

But in this case, why the heck not, we need to focus on something other than Covid that will kill mankind. The plot of the movie is that soldiers in the present jump into the future to save their future world. Lots of time traveling and aliens fights.The movie was a fun ride and since Chris Pratt is no more a drama actor than Jackie Chan one can only expect a good clean action flick. Its a movie that requires you to just flip over your MIT or Cal Tech degree and be a kid again.The story doesn't hold water but is cohesive enough not to be too outlandish or boring.

590,purnellms,Made for your eyes only..,4,5 July 2021,"This movie is absolutely faultless when it comes to production. Not a pixel is out of place, meaning the movie should be rated a 10, if it were not for 2 things which denigrate it quite badly. I give it a fairly generous 4!Firstly, there are a few emotional scenes where you'd want Chris Pratt to nail it, but falls very short. While many will criticize Will Smith, he has a box full of skills which Chris Pratt doesn't. Good old Will would have made this a classic. Passengers was bit weak because of Mr Pratts acting limitations. It just makes the movie seem second rate.Secondly is the amount of illogical ideas the scriptwriters include in the movie. Imagine dozens of monsters awoken from 800 years of suspended animation purely by noise. Seems crazy, but not in Tomorrow War. Pratt arrives back from combat to meet his wife at the airport. His hand shaking from who knows what. Is it part of the movie? Does it affect anything in the future of the movie? No, so why include it. There are probably lots of glitches like this, which again makes the movie seem second rate.Good movie if you've been hit on the head and can't think properly.",The Tomorrow War

It is worth a watch, but it's basically a TV movie with a big budget. I like Chris Pratt, but this flick makes me wonder whether he has the gravitas to carry a movie.

Chris Pratt and JK Simons were best as usual.I love the designs of Aliens & the emotional subplot was brilliant. I had tears in my eyes when Dan says goodbye to her daughter. It reminds me of the Interstellar movie.The first act of this movie was a bit slow and boring but the second and third act was just brilliant and full of action.

It is an action movie with alien monsters.The biggest question for me was, how did they managed to create a spaceship like that, yes they didnt, but thoose who prisoned them didnt looked smarter ether..
Biggest suprirse for me was how good cgi and sound was. Those creatures at some scenes looked real and really good. Sounded real too. Also design was on point. I had feeling that they mixed something from Half-life game. Monster design was 10/10 for sure. And they showed them pretty musch actually. U just can't give this movie less than 7 or 8.

601,Drawmort,It would have been perfect for a movie night in the theaters,6,5 July 2021,"Entertaining movie, perfect to see in theaters in a summer we didn't have.THE GOOD THINGS:It has an excellent pacing, a flawless soundtrack, good acting for an action movie, and a main plot easy to follow with some nice little twists. Great action sequences, good CGI, good locations (real and virtual).I loved the design of the creatures, which are a excellent example of a relentless cinematic predator for a survival thriller.SPOILER: I can't leave out of this review the spectacular slow motion scene of the sacrifice of Muri from the future. The best scene in the movie, visually speaking.For those who say it has a 90s vibe, it's true, and it's great that it does.THE BAD THINGS:Sadly, some characters like Pratt's were conveniently good at fighting the creatures, detracting from the film's credibility. The last combat was way too easy. It could have been better and more believable, but hey ... he's the hero of the story.Also, sometimes there are characters that are too obvious for some situations and there are some very easy solutions for the entire plot. There are good twists and very bad twists that make you wonder ""how this idea was approved for the script??"" Luckily, the action and suspense of the movie manage to make these details forget, even if it looks impossible to do it.In short, it is not one of the best films of its genre, but it is above average, being quite entertaining.Recommended if you are looking for an action, adventure, science fiction and suspense movie.",The Tomorrow War
602,ryanwesthamfan,Cool Action while overly long,7,6 July 2021,"The Good- this is a film I've been interested in the total premise immediately intrigues me and I love Chris Pratt in these types of roles. He rocks it in this role and is probably one of the most dramatic role he has played. There is one scene in here that absolutely broke me. Once we got into the second act and seeing our characters go into war the film gets so intense and I love it. Honestly I thought it was good enough and the good definitely outweighs the bad. The design of the aliens were great I love the they were able to do with the visual effects here while also doing something different with the aliens that we haven't really seen before.The Bad- The film was way too long, there was probably around half an hour of the film where it seems like they could of cut certain scenes. The final act drags a little and fails to hit the heights of where the second act ended at. The final act also rushes through some elements. Some of the time travel elements didn't make sense.Overall thoughts- It has it's issues but the good things about this film was able to win me over with it's performances action and mythology. Although I'd have loved to see it in cinemas it is the perfect film to watch at home on Amazon Prime and one that I think is worth streaming. Overall I'm going to give ""The Tomorrow War a 7/10.",The Tomorrow War

605,madsmartinussen,Somebody missed the point,7,9 July 2021,"""Did you just tell it to die?""""Yeah!""""It worked... why didn't you do it sooner?""These lines perfectly sum up this movie. It's a self aware, action packed, fun and thrilling sci-fi movie, with a buttload of cliches and plot holes.And that's the point.I understand people thinking this was stupid, hardly any time travel movies ever make a whole lot of sense in the first place, and as a lot of reviewers point out, some elements are way over the top. Among these are the way the whole thing wraps up in the last 30 minutes with the wife and high school kid figuring out what the sharpest minds in 30 years somehow couldn't, and something about taxes.These events are beyond ridiculous, but along with the next to last dialogue of the film (which I'm paraphrasing above), they are also its saving grace. I laughed my ass off, not because it was stupid, but because it was such a brilliant way to tell the viewer ""if you took what you just saw seriously, you kinda missed the point"". Or did you?To enjoy a movie like this, you need to be able to switch your brain off, and let yourself get taken for a ride, and the main problem is that the movie takes a bit too long to let it's audience in on the joke. I have no doubt in my mind that ""Starship Troopers"" is the paramount muse here; stupid jokes, scary and vicious aliens, tons of shooting and clichés up the a**. That film, however, didn't waste any time letting you know how stupid it was, and that it was on purpose. This one waits at least 90 minutes, only ever hinting at the true ridiculousness to come, and in that respect, it does kinda seem dumb, and I think that's what's putting a lot of people off.It seems to want to be taken very seriously for the first half at least, and I can't rule out the possibility that maybe it does. Maybe I'M the one who missed the point?Ultimately, I don't really care who did, or if there ever even was a point to miss, I enjoyed every last minute.",The Tomorrow War

I think without Pratt's star power this would be a ""direct to tv"" type movie.

610,dudewholikesthepits,Entertaining Popcorn Flick: Watch Only If You've Nothing Else To Do,6,27 July 2021,"A very fun flick. Good performances. The CGI was good (and I'm a huge fan of practical effects over CGI). The pacing was great. I hate those ""action"" films that have 5 minutes of action in acts 1 and 2 and then maybe 15 minutes in act 3. This film has it peppered throughout. HOWEVER, as with Army of the Dead, you really have to turn your brain off. If you think, you'll have too many questions. This is a popcorn flick for when you have nothing else to do and/or your favorite show doesn't come back on for another month or so. It's entertaining, but it's not a brain trust meeting.1) Unlike in A Quiet Place time travel is involved. Sure the almost indestructible creatures appeared out of nowhere to attack Russia, but that had not yet happened when the time travelers arrived why not plan for that day? You have 30 years to improve weaponry, train troops as to where the creatures are vulnerable, and prepare. Why just take people to the future for an almost certain death when you could lay in wait with the upper hand?2) Why did it seem like Pratt was surprised when his character thought about using the toxin in our time, to end the war before it started, rather than taking it back to the future to fight a lost war? Common sense would say to use it before the war even started.3) ""Derp, the world's breaking down. We can't send you to Russia to stop the war before it starts. I mean, think about it, giving the world the hope that we can stop the creatures before their first attack couldn't possibly help to calm things down. Let's ignore your new information instead.""4) Don't tell people where the soft spots are until you see a guy literally fighting one of these death machine aliens with an axe. Then slide dramatically across the floor, blast it in the neck and belly. THEN tell people that those are the only vulnerable spots.5) Was the high school kid really the only volcano expert on the planet? Sure, in Hollywood foreshadowing fashion, he had the answer, but would he be the first place you went with the world's resources at your fingertips?6) Females are ""rare"" so how did they breed fast enough to take over the world? Sure there was a colony of them in the ship, but they wiped out almost 8 billion people in a world with enough weapons to destroy itself 100 times over.The list continues, but you get the picture. Expect what you get from Hollywood these days and either enjoy the spectacle or give it a pass. There are plenty of indie films with the heart and mind you're looking for (and let us not forget books) if this isn't your time killing cup of tea.",The Tomorrow War

Get on or not; If I could go back in time I would certainly convince myself not to.Oh, and re. Fun with Freud:Check the last fight with the female alien. Would Sigmund Freud not have an awful lot of fun with it?That is how we mend America: Let the good boy fight with the alt-right/ conspiracy Santa to battle the female that is alien to them because she wanted to rule the world.

He can play a believable super/action hero, but he can also take the mick out of himself and always plays the humble, slightly nerdy guy at the same time as saving the world. It really comes off well in this film. One of the most irritating things about these huge blockbuster human v alien movies is how everyone becomes a super-soldier over night, which is utterly unrealistic and boring after a while. This was incredibly refreshing in that people were literally plucked off the street and thrust into a future war they knew absolutely nothing about. All the future needs is numbers and the draftees deliberately so old that they aren't actually alive in their own right in the future timeline. This led to some very amusing moments and a real sense of this being able to happen: they could be us one day--finally, we the audience can identify with the characters on the screen. The aliens were particularly well done with a dense and credible backstory which was developed and used as part of the plot. They were amazingly crafted: CGI at its finest. All in all, I can't really fault this film. Really enjoyable. Oh, a mention to JK Simmons. Steals every scene, even from Chris Pratt, and that's quite an achievement. Wonderful actor.",The Tomorrow War

621,kristal-42201,Worse than I'd Expected,3,4 July 2021,"The cast is good, it's fast paced, the action is okay. So far so good. Then there's a pile of things that don't make sense whatsoever.First thing that's daft is when they time-jump and land in the future they drop 1,5 - 3 meters. Nice! You're running out of people on the planet and you have people break their ankles or legs. Why not give them something to slow the fall?What they fight is only vulnerable in the belly and throat. Yet they sent out millions of people with rifles to safe mankind from extinction? Why not use weapons that would easier hit them from below? Grenades maybe? Mines. Grenade launchers and whatnot.When they get the toxin which will sort the problem, he has to take it back to his own time to stop it from happening. Then he's whinging he's lost his daughter, mankind is lost and so on.Say what? He's got the toxin to save the world? So if he makes that happen his daughter won't die, that future he went to won't ever come to be.Next stupid thing: they go to the place where those aliens are still nicely frozen with a handful of people. No one else knows about it, so if they die that bad future WILL happen after all.Also, why do they have to inject each alien one by one with the toxin? Why not come up with something that at least works from a distance to keep people safe?It's a shame they didn't come up with a better story without a ton of holes in it as the concept was solid and very interesting.",The Tomorrow War
622,almanac-39178,Brain not required,3,5 July 2021,"This film caused me to feel like my intelligence, my faith in humanity and my will to live were all ebbing away from me, threatening never to return unless I switched it off. The plot is stupid and nonsensical. Chris Pratt can't shine because the role isn't comedic enough. Some of the dialogue - especially the ""emotional"" moments - is cringeworthy. The CGI aliens - as in so many movies - move too fast, making them lose any impression of realness. No physical, organic creature could move that fast, for God's sake! Bring back the Queen in Aliens. That was created without CGI and it's much better than these fast-mo abominations.The movie is probably OK if you're 12 and all you want is action, but otherwise steer clear.",The Tomorrow War
623,aelthric,Millennials and Genz's can't fight space bullies without Boomer and GenX's help.,7,4 July 2021,"When I first read about this movie the first thing that struck me was that Millennials and Generation Zs travel back in time to DEMAND help from their much maligned BOOMER and GENX predecessors, and it struck me how apt the story was as Millennials and Gen Z kids really have no coping mechanisms whatsoever for violence of any kind let alone the ability to save their World from SPACE BULLIES.I was surprised that there weren't lots of signs all over the ruins of the overrun cities offering ""SAFE SPACES"" for the poor little snowflakes to run away to and have a good cry.I was particularly amuzed that 30 years in the future of the Billions of humans alive that fewer than 500,000 actually had the courage to bother fighting back as wrapping them up in cotton wool for all their lives certainly would not toughen them up enough to stand their ground against these mean space bullies.Alas they were too weak and pathetic to fight back requiring the help of BOOMERS and GENX's and ultimately they let the space bullies overrun the Earth so badly and so completely before asking for help from their predecessors that even the massacre of BOOMERS and GENX's couldn't stem the tide...But do not despair the BOOMERS and GENX's that returned from that time have a plan and decide to attack the Aliens at their point of entry before they can break out into SNOWFLAKE world in the future and they kick righteous ass to save all the future little SNOWFLAKES having to get all upset about the space bullies.In fact it is ONLY a handfull of BOOMERS and GENX's that eradicate the space bully menace whereas billions of Millennials and GENZ's just sought shelter in their ""SAFE SPACES"" crying and hoping the Nasty Space Bullies would just go away.Cut to scene where BOOMER returns from the mission to eradicate the space bully menace to let precious little snowflake GEN Z know BOOMER Daddy has beaten up the nasty space bullies and so she can now go back to her safe space and feel all safe and supported and never have to see anything that might upset her again...The End...",The Tomorrow War

Great setup, great pacing, great execution, great score. I don't usually enjoy action movies this much, but I was all in by the time they first time-jumped.Only major complaints, I hate time-loop paradoxes (makes me think the timeline they jumped to was an alternate timeline,
meaning it may have never affected our protagonists) and why did they attack the ship at the end with no plan?",The Tomorrow War
629,kadenkgcampbell,It's a very entertaining movie,8,3 July 2021,"I don't know why everyone in the reviews are so upset! Who hurt you? Who told you you weren't allowed to enjoy a FICTIONAL action packed film with great actors. Time Travel has never made sense in a scientific way through all the paradoxes and contradictions but it doesn't make the movie bad. Some people made dumb decisions in the movie but that ALWAYS happens in Cinema; it was pretty action packed and fun. It's not winning an Oscar it's just to grab your attention and make you say ""Whoa"". Overall, well done movie.",The Tomorrow War
630,treborbasset,Ignore the bad reviews,8,10 July 2021,"It's fairly obvious that most of the people leaving sub-5 reviews are people who should never have been watching this film in the first place. Such a shame to have a quality film panned. I hope the creators know this is exactly the kind of thing they should be making more of, instead of just about every other film that's been made in the last five years.This is a great sci-fi action movie. It feels like something from the 90s, with its strong leading man, great action scenes, and unlike most films made nowadays, no needless ridiculing of men or shoehorning in of 2020 leftist politics (with the minor exceptions of a hint about global warming, and going to a black schoolkid for advice about volcanoes instead of an actual scientist).The CGI is in The Tomorrow War fantastic. The aliens almost look physical because the materials are so good. The plot is great. A lot of the complaints people have in other reviews seem to be from their own misunderstandings.The acting is good, although it's not Chris Pratt's finest performance, he is a good enough actor that it doesn't matter. You can expect big budget explosions and lots of shooting. Despite the long run time, I never once felt bored or wanted to check my phone. The pacing was perfect.And beneath it all was a solid message about the importance of family. I would happily watch this again. For me it's a classic like Terminator 2, Predator, Aliens and Edge of Tomorrow.",The Tomorrow War

634,tampajoey,Pretty decent sci-fi action movie,7,4 July 2021,"The Tomorrow War is an enjoyable sci-fi action movie. Acting and special effects were better than many sci-fi movies. Plus, it was nice to see something come out of Hollywood that didn't push a political or social engineering agenda (which is very rare these days). I was pleasantly surprised they didn't ruin the movie pushing the whole climate change narrative, which would have been easy to work into the story with the aliens being buried beneath the ice. Too many pretentious people go into movies looking to for plot holes instead of just enjoying a movie for what it is.",The Tomorrow War
635,becca7931,Better Than Edge of Tomorrow and Here's What Makes it So,9,5 July 2021,"1) There is no silly romance involved and taking away from the plot. Edge of Tomorrow was basically a romance drama mixed with Groundhog Day (can we all just agree that has been done to death?) with a touch of sci-fi thrown in just for kicks. The Tomorrow War was an actual sci-fi action flick.2) The Tomorrow War doesn't take itself so freaking seriously. Yes, the jokes could have used punching up, but there was a lot of humor built in under the surface, also. If you only look for a bunch of Tony Stark punchlines, then you miss stuff.3) I am guessing those leaving bad reviews about how they weren't prepared to be at war have never been to war and do not understand the drafting process. You go through a quick bootcamp and then you are dropped in a hot zone. You do not get to just train until you are amazing. That is not what in-the-minute war is like. Was it a little sloppy and ultra rapid-fire in the movie? Sure. Again, it's a movie. But it was not anywhere close to as unbelievable as critics would have you believe.4) Tom Cruise was not in it. That right there makes it better than Edge of Tomorrow. Tom Cruise can't act his way out of a paper bag. He is the exact same person in every. Single. Movie. You seen him in one action movie, you've seen him in all.5) Yes, at times, it was predictable, but every action movie is predictable. They are all formulaic. At least it wasn't as formulaic as Edge of Tomorrow. You might suspend belief at times during this movie, but at least the characters are not so stupid they die repeatedly and have to start over again like a video game. Talk about suspending belief.MINOR SPOILER:
The toxin absolutely WAS used, and used to the very last alien. He literally punched the toxin into the female alien's mouth right before she fell. So that point critics are using that it was barely used is completely wrong. They weren't paying attention.",The Tomorrow War

I thought the aliens looked great, and the visuals were also pretty good too. I also thought the military sea base looked cool and that there was some great shots and sequences when the aliens were attacking it and also the shot right before Chris Pratt's characters jumps back to present day.This movie is enjoyable if you are willing to leave common sense and high expectations at the door.",The Tomorrow War

643,Bob_Dang_Dole,3 stars only because of that chubby Kevin Hart brobro,3,2 July 2021,"The beginning of this movie is very confusing. They have a Satan lawn ornament for xmas, they're watchin soccer on Chistmas Eve, his wife has a bad butch haircut..... wth is going on here? I've never in my life seen such an evil Christmas!This movie steals from Edge of Tomorrow (obviously) and the monsters are a creature with Alien bodies, Predator mouths, Tremor tentacles... and they remind me of the AI dogs from that Netflix show (Black Mirror, but instead of robots they're genetically engineered)... Also, they steal from the Starship Troopers. They have to capture a queen to figure out how to kill them. To make matters worse global warming is what wakes up the creatures. To make matters even super-duper worse The alien craft is piloted by what seems to be predators, to make it even that much worse-worse the monsters were meant to be used as weapons by the predators piloting the craft... just like um predators vs aliens... hmmmm? Oh yeah and the whole bit about the aliens being here the whole time steals from War of the Worlds. They stole from so many movies, but hey it's Amazon, its okay! They should have just named this The Edge of Tomorrow War of the Alien WorldsAnd of course it has all the predictability you would expect from Amazon wokeness.As for the good parts... the main character looks like Seth Rogen with a 6 pack... seriously how his this dude with such a chubby face packing a 6pack??? And the ONLY good aspect of this movie (besides the biology class room with the kid who likes volcanoes, u funny bro!) is the chubby Kevin Hart looking dude... comedic relief was greatly needed in this movie.If it wasn't for the chubby Kevin Hart I would rate this as 1 because this movie stole from so many other movies and had the wokeness predictability 100%.Lastly, this movie seems to be like a giant-monstrous ad for COVID-19 vaccines. At the end they develop a serum to kill the monsters. Call me crazy, but the serum could be seen as the COVID-19 vaccine and the monsters are COVID.Also, here is my take on the ending because some people thought the ending was stupid that they went into the alien ship instead of just blowing it up. The reason it happened this way was because white people made the vaccine/serum... but the black folk sacrificed themselves... so in the end the black folk save the day.",The Tomorrow War

It's also the one most often botched because so many writers fail to establish their rules and stick to them. Here there is an element of ticking clock, and the question of ""why not go back to a different time and stop it?"", but they address it quickly with a simple yet effective restriction. The creatures are terrifying and the action intense, with peril at every turn. There are a few tropes and cliches, but they are used sparingly to increase the fun. It's nice to get an original story, particularly in scifi and fantasy, rather than just another sequel, reboot, or rip off.

We've seen it all before but done better with a more compelling storyline.I salute Amazon for actually producing a movie and it must have been expensive but it meanders through relationship resolutions to the point that one wonders how any of this movie could have come out positive.Now, this isn't the production team behind Mrs. Maisel which was not only a major effort but well acted and also looked at relationships but that was kind of the intent. This did none of that.Amazon, hire some decent writers with less of an axe to grind than the ability to write compelling dialog. This movie had none.",The Tomorrow War

There is zero -- ZERO -- character development for anyone. The dialog is at a a 3rd grade reading level. The editing of the scenes seems like a different editor edited each scene. Continuity and logic are out the window. Who said Chris Pratt could act? He has one look and demeanor the entire film -- ""Duh.... I don't know. Ummmm... ok."" Profound for sure.

Its great that we can see some good CGI without the film constantly being filmed in the dark.

Director Gives Good time for their boding which I love the most. Bonding between Chris & Yvonee was great to see. 2nd thing that the story is so decent to watch. VFX were so good in the movie. All the action scenes all the aliens were so thrilled viewers. Outstanding VFX Makes this movie more awesome. Climax was more satisfying. Humour in this movie also very good.

So, it gets lost in what it is trying to be theme wise.The emotional stuff is hit-or-miss, you care about what is going on with characters, which you can't say for many this type of movies, though some supporting characters leave lot to be desired. Also, you have frigging JK Simmons and he gets like 10 mins screen time, that's a crime. The action scenes are well directed, good CGI.

Because this movie is a mash-up of all of them, and a poor mash-up at that.The dialogue: Wooden, stilted, and occasionally cringeworthy.The story: A few interesting twists. Not enough to save it, however.The characters: Forced humor. Poor timing on most humorous moments. Typical ""father and son"" strained relationship. A wife who looks like she needs the restroom through the whole shoot. I found myself not caring about any of them.The plot: Yawn.The aliens: Cows meet the Queen from Alien. Next.The verdict.

And daddy must have walked out on them and left them there and not only do they carry the scars and memories of that day daddy left, but they never matured emotionally past that twelve year old.I'm kind of in disbelief at how much money and effort was spent on this with seemingly no one stepping in and trying to fix it any way.So dumb.Embarrassingly dumb.""You've got to make sure this never happens."" says one of the characters. Unfortunately it did. And now we have to deal with it. Another character says, ""Watch your visibility"".

It's like someone had an idea and thought, let's shoot that without any thought on how to set it up or whether it works.It's like a concept you get when you're high, and it sounds great in your head but when you put pen to paper, you realise it's not that good and in fact, it does not work at all.It's like that, except they went ahead and made it anyway.This has diminished the careers of everyone involved.",The Tomorrow War

They're saying it's like another version of ""Starship Troopers"" - or a mixture between that movie and ""Edge of Tomorrow"" (excellent, too!) and honestly, though they have similarities, this movie has many things going for it.First of all, action packed with good special effects, which for this kind of science fiction movie is important. Yes, there are things that I didn't agree with, like the fact that they're apparently using almost the same kind of airplanes and helicopters and ships that are already NOW about 20-30 years old. That would be the equivalent of us still using only technology from the 60s and 70s, which is not the case, by and large (there are obvious exceptions). There are also stupid parts like in the beginning search and rescue mission when they're screaming out orders inside the building, which would never happen. Or the fact that older Muri stupidly jumps in with the queen and nothing at all happens go her. The acting was a bit wooden in only a couple of parts, mostly when Pratt first meets older Muri.But if you forget those things, the movie is thoroughly enjoyable. Great alien chase scenes, explosions all over the place, and then when you thought that all of it was done, here comes volcano-kid to save the day. You got ANOTHER mission, this one WAY too short.

The scenes where they are swarming over the base walls, oil rigs, choppers and cruise ships was well done.As to be expected, some plot holes - like being told early on that the aliens could only be killed from the neck and the belly, yet later on you see drones like HK's (from Terminator) shooting them from behind and above, clearly through the back. Maybe they had stronger guns?Bit of a slow bit in the middle with the father/daughter bonding. Went on for a bit too long.

It's all noise and FX!Get this: the toxin that kills all the aliens is developed in the future by the protagonist's daughter. She tells him very plainly that it's too late to either mass produce or to use the toxin as a weapon in the future time, so she wants him to take the toxin back with him into the past, mass produce it there, and then use it to kill all the aliens back there before the war ever starts! Then he gets all upset because it means that he'll have to leave her in the future to die. But!!! If he stops the war from ever happening, she won't die!!!!! So all his emotional concern is a waste of time, since the only way to actually save his daughter is to prevent the war from ever happening! The war is all but lost, so to stay means everyone dies!Then he gets back to the past and tells them about the toxin. But he still thinks he needs to mass produce it and send it into the future for some idiotic reason! Then, after figuring out where the aliens will be coming from, he asks the government to send a mission to Russia so that they can kill the aliens before they ever emerge, and the government moron thinks it's not worth the trouble! Hello! If you don't prevent the war, everyone dies! Too much trouble to prevent the end of the world? WTF!!!!Then, even though the aliens don't emerge until 2048-30 years later-they have to patch together some amateur, ragtag band of people to rush into the Russian Arctic in a desperate mission to try to find the alien ship somewhere inside an enormous glacier! Why not just take those 30 years to do everything right? There's no threat until the glacier melts enough to allow the aliens to emerge!!! But off they go, blundering around in the snow and ice, not knowing what they're even looking for! Over thousands of square miles!So nice of the aliens to provide a magnetic anomaly to help them locate the ship! So they use explosives to expose the ship from the ice! Please note that this could have allowed the aliens to emerge by the thousands 30 years early! There would have been no way they could have prevented the aliens from invading and killing everyone on earth with a handful of armed people with small arms! But they find that the aliens are still dormant, so, instead of going back and informing the world powers so that they can have 30 years to prepare for the invasion, they decide to cut a hole so they can enter the ship, having no idea, again, what they might find! They were lucky the aliens were still dormant, but that's not good enough for them! They're going to risk the fate of the whole world again by poking their noses into the alien ship just to see what happens!Then they find the dormant aliens. They already have sufficient explosives to completely destroy the whole ship, which they eventually do, but instead, they decide to give them injections of the toxin! Why not just nuke the whole thing?To drag out the ending, of course!Good thing the aliens were suddenly easier to kill at this juncture of the film!Then there's a long, drawn out sequence where Chris Pratt and JK Simmons battle the last female alien left alive, right down to punching her with their fists! How ridiculous!She finally becomes a big brown stain on the snow, and everybody's happy! Chris Pratt even says he's never going to leave his family! That's so nice! I didn't even know he was thinking about it!",The Tomorrow War
725,fosnock,The stupidly drags you out of the movie time and time again,6,15 August 2021,"Great concept for a Scifi network plot, the special effects were decent, but the movie was poorly executed. This move is just a weird combination of Battle: Los Angeles, Suicide Squad, and Starship Troopers. Anyway just when you can suspend your belief and start to enjoy the movie, the director slaps you upside the head with another ridiculous plot hole. Mild spoiler below if you have not seen the trailers.The futures solution is to send untrained civilians who can't even operate their own machine guns to fight aliens. No body armor, not even helmets, no support (tanks, artillery), no intelligence on what they are facing. And that is just the tip of the iceberg, as the stupidity gets worst from there.If anyone wants to point out the German Volkssturm, let me reply that because of universal conscription almost everyone in the Volkssturm had prior military service...In a nutshell, Chris Pratt character due to his prior military experience could have simply been attached to a deploying boot unit, with him and him alone not getting the full training, keeping the suspense and making the plot a bit more believable, but that would require that the writers\director to put in an effort.",The Tomorrow War

British an incompetent or stupid person; an idiot.Source Oxford English dictionary.The star of this ""Masterpiece"" Chris Prat(T) is aptly named considering he accepted the role after reading the script, I'll explain,
The year is 2022,we find our would be hero ex special forces school teacher cum family man with an ""Oh so sweet"" daughter, minding his own business, (A lot of nonsense dialogue later) We see him along with a shed load of other Joe and Jane Nobodies being forcibly recruited by time traveling hard ass military recruitment officers (Who happen to be women) To fight a global war 29 years into the future against a load of crappy CGI Alien spidery looking things that are hungry for human flesh(At this point I'm looking for my rubber mallet)
More nonsensical feminine inspired garbage later his entire unit save a few heroic but none the less ""Late in the movie cannon fodder"" recruits survive the jump into the future. More feminine garbage he meets the Colonel and his now commanding officer, wait for it........His daughter, all grown up and bad ass plus smart(A fore mentioned rubber mallet raised) Now I'm thinking how can this movie get any dumber? Lo and behold it didn't fail to disappoint, in the now traditional Hollywood agenda styled ""Women are just as smart and tough as men"" BS we see dad and daughter fleeing a load of spidery aliens in an armoured Hummer whilst little skinny girly pretty colonel is (Wo)manning the 50 caliber machine gun, shooting with deadly accuracy apparently not being affected by the massive recoil such a weapon would have on her tiny feminine frame. This coupled with the other stupid plot holes made my next action a no-brainer(Excuse the pun)I bought the now raised rubber mallet down across the back of my head knocking myself out in an attempt to avoid watching any more of this weak movie, unfortunately I came around in time to see that the heroes won, the aliens lost and the planet was saved all thanks to those wonderful women, a school kid and that Prat(T).",The Tomorrow War

In the future, they knew roughly when and where the aliens first appeared yet they never brought that info back to the past? They had the claw so they could've used the same basic volcano knowledge that the kid had to pinpoint where it was at. They could have put it together to go look for them. Also, they didn't need the toxin to kill the aliens at all. They only needed to blow the alien ship up. (Which they eventually did anyway)Also, in the future they only had one person working on the toxin?? Isn't she a little too valuable to be dropping into caves and fighting off the Queen?I was also disappointed in the scene where he meets Muri in the future.

The Alien scenes could be straight out of Starship Troopers but moved to a terrestrial location. Lots of similarity to Edge of Tomorrow as well.The plot holes are huge. The biggest being that we were able to develop time travel and automatic return in 30yrs but could not figure out how to destroy the aliens before all humanity was nearly lost, yet suddenly they isolate the answer in 24hrs.The plot holes in the end scenes are also gaping, but I'll not post them so as not to run the plot.The trick to enjoying the film is to, as I said, put your brain in neutral and don't get too analytical.",The Tomorrow War

And judging how old the daughter is, it must be 20 years into the future? If that's the case why are they still using bullets & guns? Haven't the military & weapons division created something better by then?This all leads to a weird ending. We get not one but two endings. One with the daughter then one with the father.

Or if it is an alternate timeline, how would the second or third or fourth wave of travellers will go to the an alternate timeline???",The Tomorrow War

Amazon seems to have figured out how to make decent TV series like Man in the High Castle, The Boys, The Expanse(yes!) and Mare of Easttown.But I've yet to see a single Amazon original movie that was anything better than adequate and most aren't even that. This dud had a great premise and top drawer special effects. I liked Chris Pratt and the diverse cast. But the plot! A good movie needs a decent plot! It needs to make sense. Also, some of the editing was sloppy so some of the fight scenes appeared disjointed. Characters that were about to be overrun one second were suddenly in the clear. Stuff like that. But the main issue was plot stupidity.Amazon, please take some of those writers working on the TV series you produce and have them work on your movies.",The Tomorrow War

WTF!Just for a minute think about this: people 30 years into the future make a plan to get back to the year 2022 and warn the world they are under attack by aliens. So instead of training the people for 30 years, to be ready for the aliens, they take these people into the year 2050. FYI: they train these people for 7 days ONLY and when the people that had combat experience all die, they start forcefully drafting housewives, students, gardeners, pensioners and everyone thats never had combat experience to go fight an alien that refuse to talk about to these people!Strange, the future are fighting with the exact same weapons we have in the year 2022.

777,jester-40564,Fun & Action packed Alien Invasion movie,7,2 July 2021,"Entertaining and action packed big budget blockbuster. Just turn your brain off and have some fun.First off, the special effects were great. A lot better than I was expecting. The Aliens reminded me of something out of the Resident Evil games. And the initial time jump was really well done as well.We had a good variety of characters, from the no nonsense action types like Edwin Hodge (he was a highlight) to the comic relief of Sam Richardson & Mary Lynn Rajskub. I have to say that for such a large cast, it worked. Everyone on the 'team' got at least one moment to shine. It reminded me of the Marines in Aliens.But keep in mind, this isn't one setting for 2 hours. There is a lot going on. Its kind of broken into 4 parts and 4 distinct settings. So the cast around Chris Pratt changes throughout the movie. It ends up keeping the movie fresh, and the pace brisk.As well as the action there are some nice sentimental moments as well.I'll admit the starting of 'Act 4' was probably the most clumsy part (and probably needed some more rewrites). When 3 adults go to a 13 year old boy for help it turned into a Nickelodeon show for 5 minutes and all I could do was roll my eyes. I know it was a call back from an earlier scene. But it just didn't work. Also, having 2 different governments refuse to help when people from the future are still stuck in the past could have been done better. Otherwise, the ending destination and battle was great.So overall, if you like Action and Sci-Fi movies, definitely check this out.",The Tomorrow War

Trust me, Rotten Tomatoes has it Critics by 52% General Audience has it at 80% but watch that grow just as Dave Chappelle's Sticks and Stones did and that should let you know instantly that the vast majority of the bad reviews are simply political in nature due to Chris Pratt's Religious Beliefs.",The Tomorrow War

It had its plot holes and cheesiness to it, but no more so than most other genre pieces. The story met its basic requirements, the acting was better than expected for this kind of film, and the effects were executed nicely. Cheesy dialogue? Check. Action overload? Half-check. Suspension of belief required? Oh yeah...There are those who just love to nitpick and highlight each and every flaw they can find. The pretentiousness of some of the other user reviews leads me to believe that their entire viewing process is to find as much crap to complain about in order to allow them to feel elevated over their peers.

809,leh0287,Decent action/sci-fi movie-if you suspend logic and rationale,6,3 July 2021,"The characters and actors make the movie better than it should be. There aren't many action movies where I'm laughing while the characters are being chased by monsters, so that was a plus. The concept is really interesting. There's something about our children and grandchildren coming back through time asking us for help that is really intriguing. It can be a decent movie overall-if you suspend logic and rationale. One part of me was enjoying the action, but the other part had all the thoughts below.So, our kids from 30 years in the future figure out how to jump back in time to save the world from aliens. Their really stupid solution is to recruit untrained civilians to fight in the future war. There are about 478 other things they could have done that would have actually helped, but they choose to draft untrained civilians to go fight in a war against almost unbeatable creatures.All the world governments totally go along with this and enforce the worldwide draft. Mortality rates are extremely high because, shocker, the civilians are untrained. Instead of doing something like researching a way to stop the war before it begins, they just keep sending people to die for absolutely no reason.Fast forward to Dan, Chris Pratt's character, being recruited by his daughter for an essential mission, only to be dropped into a highly dangerous mission in Miami, which is going to be bombed in a matter of minutes because it's being overrun. Why would he not have been dropped near her lab? So then, his daughter finds him and, even though she's humanity's last chance, she goes on a dangerous mission to capture a female creature and takes her dad who she wants to protect for her own secret mission. She tells her dad that he's the only one willing to take the toxin back to the past. Um.. why would no one else want to do that?Oh, and she tells her dad that he left their family only a few years later than his present, which is totally out of character and out of left field.So they make the toxin, but of course it's too late. Dan is able to get it back to the past, but no one questions why the dad of the future's only hope is holding a vial and he just gets to do his own thing with it. No one in the government takes him seriously, even though they supposedly know who he is. So he just happens to know the exact right people, including a teenage volcano enthusiast, to get a rag tag group of people together to kill off the aliens. They don't think through the actions of injecting toxin into these makeshift wombs at all, and shockingly it backfires.So yeah.. lots of potential, but the execution was disjointed and unbelievable. If you can suspend logic for 2 hours, it can be an entertaining watch. If not-maybe try something else.",The Tomorrow War
810,mikey79,Serves me right for watching,2,4 July 2021,"What is it with this sort of film and the Americans...? Again and again it's churned out, some sort of alien species invades, lays waste to ""Europe and those other, um, places..."" and then it's left to one random American dude in ruined American cities, with a smart talking kid, a loyal but dull wife and invariably a comedy sidekick or deep rooted side interest (in this case both) to save the day. This time the aliens are a mash up between the thing in Stranger Things and the things in The Wall (remember them? Thought not). No time is spent on the backstory of where they came from etc it's just rushed through with a quick explanation from some time travelling army people that in the future we're all doomed. They're bullet proof of course too. Oh and they're called White Spikes or something as a nod to the bad things in GoT.Anyway loads of death happens, comedy sidekick disappears for a while then reappears, the one American dude does some heroic stuff at great cost to everyone around him, the science bits are skimmed over as they're boring, and the technology is unrealistic but the weaponry is the same as now even though it's 2051...and inevitably it all ends well.This film has some serious continuity errors though, people run out of bullets then have a different gun, the bad things are bullet proof then are killed by a bigger gun and bombs (why not bomb them?), and American hero won't just do what he's told even though it'll save mankind.

815,maijita,Meh at best,6,2 July 2021,"I thought there might be a possibility that this would be a decent scifi-action film. Let's say I had high hopes. Well, I was mostly disappointed.So, turns out Chris should stick to comedies. You know, the movies he got famous for. That scene where he meets his dad for the first time in, what I assume is supposed to be in years, was awful. The fist bang on the table with the awkward pause before the serious stare and rant... Comedy gold. Except, this is not supposed to be a comedy.So many scenes that were just down right badly acted by him. But, in his defence, the script had a bunch of pretty dumb oneliners on it that even some of the, let's call them ""more serious actors"", struggled with.Then there was the side story regarding the family. Did anyone actually care?! They portray this man as the most familyman kind of guy, who resents his dad for the sole purpose of him leaving his family, to have him randomly, I suppose to jerk some tears, leave his family as revealed by his grown daughter... I mean how did he change so drastically? Why did he and his wife separate? Was there a reason or did he just completely change his morals and personality? If you make it such a big part of the story then go through with it or otherwise don't put it in.And then there was the whole thing about him wanting to take his daughter back to the past at any cost, which also made no sense. How was that going to work? Wasn't the whole purpose to go to the future to safe her FUTURE? Not to bring an older her back to the past to grow up with the younger her??! I don't even know at this point.Look, I thought it was an good effort. I didn't go in to watching the movie hating Chris or the movie. It all gradually happened while the movie progressed. I don't think there was any need for the ""emotional drama"" brought byside story. I feel like if they put all their efforts in to the main storyline this could have been a lot better. It just feels like they tried to include us ladies with the sobby bits so we'd watch the movie with the men, but it went all south from there.The idea was good. The finished product, not so much.",The Tomorrow War

819,svandamme,Watchable,7,30 October 2021,"Story line is a bit dodgy, they have Time travel, but it's only used as a plot device to set the general movie.. The Time travel isn't used by the humans in a clever way at all. Hell they are even crying about people off the future who will die, when they have 30 years time to develop technology, tactics and strategy.. But noooo. That would make to much sense.If you get over the sillyness off it all, theres a popcorn movie in there, it's not devoid of entertainment, but it's a tin layer of veneer over a polished turd. The Monsters are made to look very genuinly scary , they are fast, mean and there's a lot of them it has a bit of ""Alien meets the Matrix underground robots"". It does work well for the action fighting scenes because of the immidiate problem they represent.But again, there's nothing there that couldn't be fixed with 30 years of Intellectual and industrial output by modern society.",The Tomorrow War

821,joncolley,Great Summer sci-fi action movie,8,7 July 2021,"Ok, I need to get this off my chest first... IMDB need to take a serious look at how their reviewing system works because it's being abused. It's becoming hard to take the ratings seriously when you have dozens of first time reviews for a movie giving it one star and referring to politics, wokeness, actors political leanings and saying ""this is the worst movie ever made"". I get they're entitled to an opinion, but this isn't Twitter.Now, on to the movie...I'd not heard much about this movie, it sort of landed out of nowhere for me so I had no expectations. It's straight to Prime so I assumed it was probably going to be bad. I was wrong.What you have here is a big dumb blaster which throws in a bit of pseudo science to legitimise itself! It's perfect for the Summer, I'd have been happy if I'd gone to the cinema to see this.The alien design was... ok... They're sort of like the Geiger alien mixed with a Chinese dragon? I always wonder how they manage to get from one world to the next as they're more animal then advanced alien race - the movie addresses this (to an extent) which I loved!The concept of going back in time and taking people who are already dead by the time the aliens arrive... I like that, also the way the time travel works and it's limitations too, quite interesting.The action scenes are very good, with convincing cgi and a couple of moments which made me laugh inappropriately (people cheering at the sight of 'rescue Humvee's only to have them immediately destroyed in a graphic manner for example).I plan to watch this again on Friday with friends and a few beers and pizza :)If I have one gripe, it's the glaring plot hole surrounding the idea that the original plan was to kill the aliens in the future and not even try to save the 8 billion people who were killed when the war started???

Good actors, well played, good figting scenes, nice effects and the evil looks well evil.The story however - The premise is ok. Nothing special but ok. You could do something with it but you did not. I do not even mind the time stories - they are mostly ridiculous but I watch it if nicely done. Not here.Bottom line: it is still better than another story about zombies.I do not even mind the odd combat scenes or the fact that the evil is so well not fitting into the scenario being played but these other things: call for help and all governments jump - In what world? The last rescue mission practicalities of it are just culmination of it but previous battle scenes where things happen when they help the story to move to another segment. I admit I do it much more often now than I used to but I skipped quite a big part of the movie - the suspension of reality just did not work for me. Seen half of it eventually - just enough to say that actors & production values were really excellent. Pity that the crew's efforts got wasted.I suppose you can watch it in somewhat intoxicated state or with some friends - talking during a movie removes the problem with believing in it.

-The action and fighting scenes were done very well. Usually in these kind of movies, you see people just shooting and nothing hitting, but in this you see where they are hitting and why they are shooting so much.

Based on the plot of this movie you have to ask yourself a big question. Does humanity deserve to live with other entities of the universe, when throughout its history it has been shown that we are a warlike race, would someone like to make contact and live with such a race? ... As is well said at the end of another great movie ""Attraction (2017)"".",The Tomorrow War
831,klperkins07,On the fence,6,4 July 2021,"I think this movie is enjoyable. Imagine Zack Snyder's Army of the dead level action and senseless plot mixed with an Alien SciFi movie, a lot of people reference Kill, die, repeat.I agree with a lot of people's perspective of joke placement. I think it is distracting to the tone and pace of the movie. And a majority of them don't land or are just awkward. Timing is everything in comedy and the movie takes itself too seriously to have it so unevenly scripted.Most of the timeline stuff doesn't make sense or aren't explained well. They tried to bail themselves out ""End Game"" style but asking and answering certain questions on the audiences behalf, but I was still left wondering a lot more.Like: why not introduce this future technology to the past and give them 30+ years to perfect it and time traveling while resources exist?? Why not send people from future to the past to train and prepare for what's coming? Seems idiotic to ruin/ destroy the past population to then have fewer people in the future to fight. Even if those people they were sending would die by the time the invasion/ war started, even in 7 years Chris Pratt's character could have
had several more kids to help populate the earth and possibly fight in the future vs him die in the future and end his bloodline. Instead of sending people to future, build forts/ bunkers and protection in the present. Development of new weapons and bombs. They aware of the first sighting. Start doing the research in the present to to preventative measures.. could have dropped an atomic bomb in the present and been done lol Start population protection programs on 2022 and start training soldiers young in present to fight in the future. Seems dumb to send chefs and plumbers and out of shape people just to practically die and weaken the current population and potential existence of skilled laborers. Seems like multiple timelines are existing? If he has the toxin in the past then technically his daughter's future timeline is erased and she wouldn't die because they have the cure/ toxin in the past and would know how to defeat aliens in present 30+ years before, right? Preventing the war from even starting. And if the dad from the past timeline is interrupted by jumping to future, doesn't that then change his past/ present events? His daughter would have new memories of him not ones as if his life was never interrupted. Seems like her future memories of him were as if he never traveled to future or came back with the toxin and saved the earth lol her future self would know he had the toxin in past and saved all of mind kind. That's the issue with time travel in movies. They bring up him dying in 7 years but I don't think they ever address or confront how or why.They have the technology to send millions of people from past to future and back, just don't understand why they just don't send as many people as they can from future to the past. The ones that haven't been born yet (in the present) from every country could just repopulate in 2022 lol Also Chris Pratt's team just happened to have the science guy to know it was ash under the nail, his daughter happened to survive it all in future, be a scientist and in the army and find the toxin, wife coincidentally was smart enough to suggest the aliens came a couple years earlier than the invasion started, his student just happened to be an ash expert and Wikipedia in human form, his dad had a plane and was a pilot lol.. it's like he was just surrounded by all the right people. So if Chris Pratt in the present destroys the aliens, then the folks who were with him from the future and anyone else from future stuck in past should just cease to exist right? Their purpose for coming to past would no longer exist and their timeline would be erased because present events create a butterfly effect lol like their relatives/ parents could have been sent to the future and died fighting and shift events and timelines for their future. Luckily the plan went almost perfect because Chris almost started the invasion 30 years earlier lol if they were going to C4 the whole thing, then why risk lives trying to administer the toxin? So in the past, Chris prevents the alien invasion, so those people from future never come to the past right? So do all the people in the present who died in the future fighting aliens that technically never existed in the future just ""Snap"" or ""blip"" back? Are they still dead? Does the time travel technology still exist or all just disappear? If so, can they travel back to past before everyone went to the future and sacrificed their lives? Like so many questions lolOverall though, actions scenes are really thrilling and captivating. Had me on the edge and I felt like there were some real stakes. CGI well well done and executed. Exposition was shoved in our faces. ADR was bad in some scenes. But my mom really enjoyed it and it killed 2 hours. Time travel movies are hard, I wish this could have answered some questions or tied up a few loose ends.",The Tomorrow War

I also rely on IMDb for choosing what to watch because the ratings are usually spot on. For that reason, I almost didn't watch The Tomorrow War, but I've gotten so bored with what's out there to watch, I decided to watch some of the beginning to see if I thought it was worth my time - and it was! That said, I wouldn't call it a great movie, but I really enjoyed it. As with any Sci-Fi, the viewer has to accept the reality of the movie, and sometimes, that is very difficult. But, with the technological advances of the 21st century, it was easy to buy in to the premise of The Tomorrow War. Aldo, I actually cared about several of the characters, even though many were poorly established in the beginning. Ignore the negative reviews and give this movie a chance. I think you'll find it fun and interesting to watch, just like I did.",The Tomorrow War

Except for a few outstanding acts, this film lacked logic and narrative. As a result, the future army was looking for elder generations who might not have survived the present alien invasion in order to fight again. This may be replayed indefinitely since you can always locate those individuals in the past, much like the main character did after losing his daughter to an extraterrestrial. The final scene was hilarious, as they utilized a youngster to track out the alien's location. Was it some sort of joke?",The Tomorrow War

837,Black2White,For a better tomorrow,8,4 July 2021,"So I've finally seen the movie, watched it with the whole family and I got to say it was a great fun time to share.In these recent times when Hollywood delivers nothing but flops or movies that are only aiming for a minority of people, The Tomorrow War is a welcome intake of fresh air.Nothing done in this movie is actually really new, I've seen many of the things in this movie already being done in other past movies, but the main difference is how everything comes together.Chris McKay did a great job pulling so many different ideas already explored and giving them a new touch.Even the idea of the movie is brilliant, and the tech stuff, the explanation parts never lose you. It isn't like for example in the Godzilla movies where you got a bunch of characters throwing sci-fi explanations all over the place.McKay kept things simple, easy to understand, relatable and even enjoyable.Even the time traveling part that most times gives some people headaches was done with easy explanations, that anyone can understand.The whole premise of the movie is that humanity 30 years into the future finds itself on the brink of extinction because of an alien invasion. Something that was done so subtly that when humanity realized it had happened, the enemy was already all over the place.And because humanity is on its last legs they find a way to go back in time and recruite people from the past to go to the future, and help humanity win the war.Even here Chris McKay excelled at handling this with intelligence.You see that those people being recruited are only those past a certain age and those training them are all young.Which the character of Dan Forester (Chris Pratt) immediately understands and thus explains the viewers why that was so.This movie is easy to understand and it holds you to it from beginning to end. And it holds you because the characters created and the actors/actresses chosen to play each role fit like a glove.Many of the most heavy emotional scenes happen with Dan Forester being front and center and boy does Chris Pratt delivers his A game in this role. Dan is the average American family man, with a wife, a daughter, and some family issues. But he's still the driving force behind most scenes. Pratt doesn't singlehandedly carries the movie but he sure does lead the group of actors and actresses all throughout the movie.One thing no one can say about this movie is that it's too predictable or too unrealistic. Although there are indeed some predictable moments that you do see coming, you're also given some surprises along the way. There are characters that you think for a moment that they're going to have the typical death that you were sure was going to happen, but then something realistic happens and that character makes it.All actors and actresses gave it their best in this movie. Some more than others, but you can't really complain about the overall quality especially when you see it all come together.This is definitely a must see movie. It isn't a movie that is astonishing or revolutionary, but if you're looking for a good investment of your time and money then this is definitely that. It is a good movie that balances very well the serious parts with the comic relief parts. Also this movie holds some surprises that you will definitely not see coming. I personally got to point I was so deep into the movie that after a scene I thought that that was it, the movie was about to end, when in fact there was still some time left and I only didn't realized that because the movie held me to it.Some movies you almost have to force yourself to not fall asleep through them, with The Tomorrow War you never even begin down that path. The movie has a little bit of everything in it but all in the right dosage. It didn't tried to be too smart, or too funny, or too dramatic, or even too serious. It is a well balanced movie that the whole family can enjoy, and if you're watching the movie by yourself then you can enjoy it as well.Also another important aspect of this movie is that it doesn't really leaves that many questions unanswered. The most important questions you might have about certain characters or even the events that are happening, they are all answered. All that's left unanswered are small details that you can easily go on not losing any sleep over them.In a time when good movies are hard to find. In a time when it's becoming increasingly difficult to watch a movie that doesn't have a political agenda behind it or front and center like some have nowadays. The Tomorrow War has none of that. This movie was made so people can disconnect from their daily lives and just enjoy the ride.I was honestly positively surprised by how good this movie is and by how easy it was to watch it. So if you're looking for a good movie this one is definitely one you should see. It will not disappoint in all the things that actually matter. It isn't perfect seeing no movie is perfect, but it will also not let you down.",The Tomorrow War

Bit disappointed with the logic to be honest, I've noticed the lack of that in the 1st 30 mins, and instead if using guns to defend they could have come up with better ways like blades to cut off stuff into pieces and what happens to dont change things in the past or the future will get affected?

866,cooler-16687,Great action / not that great of a story,7,1 August 2021,"This is a weird one.When an attempt is made to have a more emotional dialogue and such, the movie falls completely flat.This might partially be because of Chris Pratt's performance.He's a great actor when things aren't too serious but whenever he needs to be serious, it feels / looks like he's unsure about it, like there's a joke waiting to reveal itself.This movie shines when the action hits though....The CGI on the creatures look pretty good, sound design too.The pacing shifts into gear and honestly has me at the edge of my seat.So yeah, i can recommend the movie, but there will be some dull moments.I'm not the 'i need non stop action' type of guy, but like mentioned before, the acting performance and story during the more serious scenes are 'meh' so keep that in mind.",The Tomorrow War
867,aequanimis,"A unique, interesting, and overall fun experience.",6,7 July 2021,"The Tomorrow War is about humanity losing a war against a hostile alien species that starts sometime in the 2050's. As a last resort, they travel back in time to recruit more soldiers to help them fight and find a strategy to win as their world population in the 2050's is dwindling. Chris Pratt is Dan Forester, our protagonist. This movie is really interesting in the sense that I feel that it blended several movie genres together to create one, cohesive, multifaceted experience.On the whole, this movie is quite fun and very enjoyable. There's a lot of things that it did well that make it memorable. For one, the alien design (they're called Whitespikes in the film) is unique and captivating. This movie is a great example of CGI being used effectively and appropriately to create a more involving movie-watching experience. The creatures felt like they were actually present in the world, and the movie was really able to communicate their immense physical strength and speed in the scenes where they were present. There were times when I wondered if they were using animatronics or practical effects to create some of the more goopy scenes or the ones where the actors were actually touching the aliens because it seemed so real.The characters were all likeable and distinguishable. Within a short amount of time, the audience is able to connect with even the minor characters (like Norah and Robert) and get a good sense of who they are as people. I found myself being worried for the well-being of the main characters and rooting for their survival. When people did die, it felt like a genuine loss to their team, which is how you're supposed to feel.However, there were some things that I felt kept this moving from being really great. For one thing, I felt that there was some artificial drama being created with the whole ""Oh, you left mom and I and died in a car accident"" storyline. It felt really out of character for Dan to do that and overall not very relevant or meaningful to the story. The movie doesn't introduce Dan as a character who seems eager to leave his life to pursue something that will fulfill him more. In fact, he seems like he's morally opposed to that type of decision since his dad left him when he was a kid. Despite this, at the end of the movie, he says something like ""I realized that the right future was right in front of me all along"", which doesn't really make sense considering the character's history. I wonder if that was an arc the character was originally supposed to go through or maybe the intended impression you were supposed to get from Dan's character, but if it is, it was not communicated well at all. Additionally, the plot feels kind of thin when we get around 3/4 of the way into the movie and Dan is super hung up with this idea of going back to the future and saving Muri. Wasn't the plan to prevent the war in the past before it even happened? Why does he care so much about the future version of his daughter dying when preventing the war will prevent that version from ever existing? It's a little confusing. I did appreciate that they had a scene where the future people were explaining the jumplink to the past draftees because it seemed like they used that scene to prevent people from poking holes in the plot. Time travel is always tricky in movies, and I liked that they considered the different questions people would have. It felt a little... ham-fisted and I do wish they would've been more creative and answered those questions in a more natural progression, but it's still cool.The sound design is weird. This movie is not exempt from the volume game that you have to play where you turn it up for scenes with dialogue and turn it down for scenes with music. However, the soundtrack was incredibly overbearing for some scenes. A lot of the battle scenes were basically montages of characters fighting the Whitespikes while the soundtrack blared over it, and that does not seem intentional at all.There were contrasting themes of hope/optimism and despair/nihilism, which were an interesting thought, but felt inconsistent and kind of forced throughout the movie. Characters were either relentlessly optimistic or negative depending on their purpose, and it wasn't always consistent who was who. I felt like they wanted to do a bit of criticism of big government complacency, but just threw it in last minute. The scene where the president of the US (I'm assuming) refuses to fly them to the Russian glacier felt really sloppy, disingenuous, and a little comedic.Although these things did take me out of the movie for a bit, I did like it and feel like it was pretty memorable. 6/10. A unique, interesting, and overall fun experience.",The Tomorrow War

And the traveling through time to find support prior to the invasion is quite epic. All the social structures it depends on, the bureaucracy, technocratic solutions etc. Are quite believable. There are a few major plot holes, or way too in your face antics to only draw out a fight that could easily have been solved in a smarter, more eloquent way than they did here.He has beef with his father, but walks out because he is challenged to a cock fight? While his entire livelihood is hanging on a string? Sure.Assignment to safe some lab rats are being jeopardized by the guy with the most experience in the field, and while other colleagues are being mulled by the thousands, he decides to delay a crucial exercise to bring these scientists to safety to work on solutions they need in order to win. Sigh.They know the queen communicates with her subordinates, yet they bring here to the only place safe from these hordes of hounds from hell, showing them the way to the one place safe, although why at sea, as clearly they can swim...?!Killing the queen bee would have been a smart move, he was being sent back to the present past with the serum they had now, no time to create more, and his daft now professional daughter who leads the team of scientists says no because... ? I have no clue of any sensible reason why, the entire world is crawling with these horse size snappers, overstaying their welcome like cockroaches, they are at the gate and to create time to reach the chopper you kill the f#cker. Right? Wrong...Than the time travel. He goes back in time, with the serum, he is not going back to this place, as they explained the time jump is like a train cart, riding the time track, so the time spent in the future is time lost at home and vice versa. His major worry should be to get the serum back in one piece to get rid of these bugs, even more so now his daughter fell of the rig, yet he decides to dive into that cesspool of killer bugs in a futile and lethal attempt to safe his daughter who will have an entirely different life once he gets back to his own present to prevent the whole cluster f#ck from happening. What?!So these are some of the things that bugged me, no pun intended. But if you can suspend your disbelief, or push it down when it rears its ugly (beautiful) head every time a story arch decision is made that is sketchy at best, it is quite the enjoyable movie! Well made, I love. JK Simmons, Chris Pratt, again, he can act off of just about everybody. The first quarrel, though lousily apologetic to stretch the narrative, is actually some great acting of both the men!So shut down your critical thinking and enjoy the ride.

Problem is, none of the writers are that smart. I'm guessing that they just made this horrible movie because they knew that people would think a movie with Chris Pratt in it would be good.

879,ronn214,"All action, very little substance or realism.",4,3 July 2021,"This movie made me angry. It had so much potential. It could have been much.much better, but it seems the director and writer just wanted to make a movi with lots of explosions and shooting. Way too many shortcuts and ""Let's take advantage of what the audience will put up with"". I saw maybe 2 or 3 instances of a rifle run out of ammo, (after shootig no less than 150+ rounds)
The writer & director loved to put the good guys in danger where it looks like nothing can save them then all of a sudden they are saved at the last minute by actions that would probably kill 99.999% of everyone else. But, since the movie isn't over, let's find a way to save the heros.The movie started out good. At a soccer game a big electrial field appears and a bunch of armed soldiers emerge. It turns out, they are Earthlings from the future who are fighting a war with an alien species, and we are losing. Badly. They need to draft members from now to go into the future and win the war. If not, humankind will cease to exist. Just 7 days and you can come back.The battle scenes were just to unrealistic but they made a lot of noise, lots of explosions and gunfire. Just what a Summer movie is all about these days. It's a fun movie for people that like explosions and killing aliens but as far as being anything of substance. Not even close. This is a teenager movie.What enraged me the most is the writer & the director were just plain LAZY. Have the heros surrouned by alien monsters and the good guys are on the way in bomber jets. Yes, they kill the aliens that are 100 feet away by dropping 500 lb bombs killing the aliens but not putting a scratch on our heros. Here's the worst part. So stupid. Chriss Pratt finds a way to kill the aliens before the war starts. See, he and his wife with the help of a high school student figure out the aliens have always been here, they didn't just land in the future, they woke up. So, the kid tells us they are in Russia. (Yeah, I know, it gets worse) So, our hero Chris Pratt, a HS teacher who just got back from the future with a formula to kill all the aliens before they wake up and the Sec. Of Defense tells him he's not going to spend taxpayers money to send them to Russia. Does that make any sense at all? So, our hero goes to his estranged father who is a whiz at techology and hates the Govt. So now we have a rag tag group of civillians on their way to Russia to find aliens buried in the snow. Yeah, it gets worse.Look folks. This is a summer teenager expolsion and action B- movies. It's a popcorn movie. Don't expect filmmaking.",The Tomorrow War
880,alex-mott,"Big, loud and stupid",5,3 July 2021,"Because there are so many things in The Tomorrow War that don't make sense, if you start asking all of the obvious, logical questions you'll probably end up missing most of the film. The premise is so unlikely I actually thought that Dan Forester was going to wake up at some point and find himself strapped to a chair in a laboratory with a nurse explaining to him that the whole thing had been nothing more than a Total Recall-style holographic experience. Nope! All of this totally unbelievable stuff is actually happening to him - including fighting a completely improbable war where him and his team of untrained civilians are routinely thrown into situations that are beyond brave and just stupid and suicidal (even for a sci-fi movie as far-fetched as this).Chris Pratt gives a solid performance as usual and unknown lovely Yvonne Strahovski is a welcome distraction, but if you're going to watch a film like this, Edge of Tomorrow did a much better job with a superior script and far less CGI (which is at squinting King Kong levels in The Tomorrow War).Think Independence Day, Armageddon or 2012 - or just look at the flying stuff and explosions and don't think at all.

If it hadn't been for the fact that they then discover that they had eventually thawed out and woke up.But they still crashed, from the sky, leaving a crater/crash site.So the wreck should have been clearly visible in the future.Why didn't they leave it at having been buried under the ice in the future?Makes me very upset =)For the rest I really enjoyed the no holds bar aggression by the aliens.Looks very slick.",The Tomorrow War

Putting the concept of time travel in any movie is often a move that could easily go wrong if the script are not being looked at closely to iron out any redundancies.In this case, there are some redundancies, but the main issues are the characters' decisions as common sense seem void.Why do they travel back in time to recruit for sacrifices when they can just prevent the invasion from starting or do their research in the past in the first place?Why go biological when physical impacts or fire are far more effective in doing mass damage? Especially when they are immobile?Why can't the future Muri wear a bracelet for herself? Almost as if she chose to die.Also if Chris already travelled to the future and remained there, where did the other copy of Chris came from that left the family and died? Wouldn't it be more realistic if the daughter grew up without ever seeing her dad after he travelled to the future?

This lead to little to no character development and what little there was was lackluster. I wasn't worried or stressed in intense scenes b/c cause I didn't care for the characters in an emotional way. Even in a dystopian syfy movie you need some realism.

I get people's frustrations with some of the plot eg Dan's character and his future daughter just take with a pinch of salt and enjoy.I only knew about Chris Pratt after watching Guardians when it came out and have always liked Yvonne in Chuck.If you watch this as a bit of fun then I'm sure you'll like it, perfect Sunday movie action.",The Tomorrow War

Well, if not climate then some alien specie with the goal of eradication human specie. Add the time traveling aspect to it, and voila, you've an entertaining Sci-Fi movie.What's so great about this one?The family bond, separation, and then re-bonding.Time traveling to fight a future war.Alien specie is pretty sick, scary, and powerful.Great story-development, cast, and an ending leaving the opportunity for The Tomorrow War 2 in the future.Certainly a movie worth watching on a BIG SCREEN.5/5 from me.",The Tomorrow War

The way they do this is select able bodied humans (based on some secret eligibility criteria) and send them randomly in the future. These people have no training, no strategy other than go kill aliens.The only lethal parts of the aliens are their necks and bellies - an extremely crucial piece of information reviewed only midway through the movie.

So I won't waste my time talking about that.Instead, the biggest thing at bugs me is the scene where they find the alien ship. So right before they find it, a series of small explosions occur followed by one big explosion. Who set off these explosions??Also, the movie doesn't explain how the space ship managed to get trapped under ice in the first place.On the bright side, if you can get past these unanswered questions and the time-travel plot holes, the movie actually is pretty entertaining and suspenseful all the way through.",The Tomorrow War

Relieved that it didn't go that route, and played to its strengths instead.Acting isn't anything Oscar worthy, but at the same time I didn't see any bad acting that deteriorated the quality of the film; everyone adequately filled their roles in my opinion. And for a movie like this that doesn't take itself seriously and just has fun with the idea, it more than gets the job done. Overall a feel good enjoyable sci fi action flick.",The Tomorrow War

But there are many including Chris Pratt's terrible acting, familiar plot points bordering on theft, silly CGI creature effects, lazy writing with enough plot holes for ten movies, cheesy dialogue, weird tonal shifts, and on and on.But what bugged me about this and does frequently with these type movies is how the characters are written. Chris Pratt for example. He is an ex Special Forces Brilliant Scientist High School Teacher ? Really? First off, how many friggen Ex Special Forces guys are out there? It seems like every action hero since Martin Riggs is one of these guys. It's like there are more of them in movies than there is in real life. Can't they make of them an Ex Systems Analyst? Then in keeping with the silliness, the grown Forester daughter is also Brilliant Scientist Commander Soldier person. And at one point when the fate of the entire human race is in the balance, she is the only one working on The Answer To Everything in a room alone? When of course the actual answer is to just blow up the spaceship but whatever, that's getting into Plot Holes #82-83.It just drives me crazy to see these supposedly normal people getting drafted to save the world and they suddenly become almost superhuman and the smartest people on the planet. One of the worst offenders is Independence Day which is littered with ridiculously written characters including a drunken cropduster who remembers to fly a jet somehow.He was probably Ex Special Forces.",The Tomorrow War

908,pooz_the_gun,Enjoyable with heart but with an abundance of plot holes and logic issues,5,12 July 2021,"This movie never really seemed like a thought provoking Piece of art after I watched the trailer but it looked like entertaining 2h to spend. And that's exactly what I mostly got.The movie's two strong suits are its heart through character interaction and motivation and the action elements. The acting is a bit tricky. Yvonne Strahovski and JK Simmons kill it. It's really impressive how much I get invested when either of those two are on the screen. Chris Pratt is a bit miscast in my opinion even though he's not bad at it. Just some decisions of portraying his character seemed a bit odd. The CGI is serviceable. There's good tension building for the action scenes even if it's not the slightest groundbreaking.The biggest issue is the inworld logic of what's happening and by its characters. To avoid spoilers I'll stick to what's been shown in the trailer. The screenwriters either don't understand time travel or they ignored it in order to get their story going according to plan. There's decisions by characters that don't make sense even a little bit and the aliens change from an indestructible force to needing only a few shots depending on who is being attacked. Besides this there's a fair amount of clichés.All in all I'd say if you're looking for an easy fix and do not want something cerebral go for it, but don't expect something you'll remember next year this time around.",The Tomorrow War

I cant make up my mind.,3,7 July 2021,"I knew we were heading towards an idiocracy. Didn't think Chris Pratt will be helming the ship in the armada of stupidity. You know what I mean.This movie's screenplay needed more time to mature. It just throws disconnected exposition and plot points via news clips and army people at you without anything to pull the audience's attention. And the time physics logic is again just thrown in there without any glue to hold it together with the pacing of the movie. For the beginning of the movie, which is long and tedious, it fails to capture any interest and proceeding seems like a chore. Also the exposition and plot points are tossed in there with such pompousness that if the audience is unable to believe the plot points, they should think they are stupid.The trailer tells half the story. So I am not spoiling it by saying why don't the nations of the world question the logic of sending people of current time to fight a war in the future rather than prevent what causes the apocalyptic future?**** Hot take ****
Pros : I dont see any pros here just shoot em up.Cons : This movie is either pompous or stupid. I cant make up my mind. Disjointed incoherent plot-physics. Exposition with pompous tone that fails to win the audience's interest.

This film borrows all its script from other movies, and uses all the usual action movie tropes.I thought that the CGI was very obvious and stuck out like a sore thumb, the physics and lighting was off so it was obvious the CG aliens were not actually there in the environment so that took away any tension or threat for me. The aliens were shouty with pointy teeth but not menacing at all.JD Simmons is brilliant, and steals the show in every scene he is in, but otherwise I found it quite underwhelming, especially for the money that must have been spent on it.

Now the plot is not a very original one either on time travel concept or Alien but it keeps you kinda intrigued till the end if you can bear storyline incoherence over the road.

918,Vinicius8,An Unpretentiously North-American Blockbuster,4,2 August 2021,"You've seen this story before. I can assure you there is nothing innovative about the plot of Tomorrow War: All-around normal dad living in the suburbs with a military and scientific background gets drafted into a special operation to save human kind from evil human-eating aliens... unending ammo gunfights and over the top explosive destruction ensues.The old ""I love my family but I gotta save the world for them to be safe"" formula is rehashed in this film (looks like we haven't had enough of those!), but with a very Disney twist: jokes. And I don't mean fully developed, clever and well-placed jokes. I mean out-of-place, insert-here pun's. I won't say I didn't chuckle a couple of times, but I'm no monster, I have a good sense of humour. That doesn't make the jokes any less lazy and misplaced. Most of them just break the tension, or don't work at all. It makes you wonder, why are they there in the first place? Almost every action blockbuster had them since the 80's, but somehow nowadays it's become mandatory to have one every 5 minutes, otherwise your audience will lose interest in the movie.Because of these formulaic constraints, ""The Tomorrow War"" crutches onward with only cheap catchphrase dialogue and predictable generalized character motivations and conflicts. In the end it does check every box, but the tasks solutions are superficial and unimaginative.By no means it's a horrible movie, however it won't be leaving a mark either. You could say it's entertaining, but when you've seen the same old story a thousand times before, the joke starts to become old and it's just not fun anymore.",The Tomorrow War

Yvonne Strahovski is much better than I'd hoped, showing real emotion that was easy to buy into. There were some huge plot holes, especially toward the end, but all in all it was an enjoyable sci-fi flick that didn't avoid some character development and did offer some good CGI special effects.

There are some funny moments but not as many as Independece Day.The whole time travel story is merely an excuse to take you to the violence. Because it is a time travel story it causes way too many plot holes. Instead of bringing people to the future a lot of other ideas should have been pursued. Why not bring alien DNA to the past so scientists would be ready to kill them? Why not save humans by bringing as many as possible back to the past? Goodness even Bill and Ted had better time travel ideas.And where are the paradoxes? Wouldn't meeting your child in the future change your past and thus change the future? Are there branches in the timeline like in Marvel comics?Ok enough of that....Why didn't they at least build anticipation for the aliens like Cloverfield, Jaws and other movies have done?Another problem- why would the entire world agree to a world wide draft? Are you kidding me? This world can't agree on anything!!!!Finally why didn't they teach the draftees the vulnerabilities of the aliens? One guy was able to explain it in one sentence during battle.

Why send people 30 years into the future instead of training people and preparing for a future invasion in the present? Likewise, the time travel science used is pathetic, so many paradoxes, the writers clearly do not have a clue about science at all. These lot should be banned from writing any more science fiction.Also the aliens looked more like dinosaurs. Are we really expected to believe that those aliens were capable of mastering space travel between stars? Add to that they were boring, similar designs have been used many times before usually in b movies. Again really poorly thought through. Lastly the script and acting, this was probably the worst part of the movie. The dialogue was cheesy as hell and the acting was wooden/stiff. The background music was trying to make the scenes dramatic but they only highlighted how bad the scenes actually were. Give it a miss, you have better things to do with your time.",The Tomorrow War

For one, how on earth is it supposed to help to bring grossly overweight men and women in their forties with no military training, to fight aliens with regular rifles, that the fully equipped military force of the entire planet couldn't handle? That's just silly, and the writer would have been better off telling ut that we're bringing the best of the best soldiers from the past to the future to help us. Not scared adults who are not in their prime. It's both weak and stupid writing.Also, it's a much weaker movie than Edge of Tomorrow and A Quiet Place, two excellent films it is natural to compare this with. The alien monsters are pretty much the same, with some variations with regard to weaknesses. But still, it's a quite enjoyable yarn at it's best, the action scenes with lots of monsters.

Very few modern movies bother with this because writers are busier creating Mary Sues than creating engaging characters with dept and believable personas.Sam Richardson was excellent as was Edwin Hodge - hopefully we'll see more of these guys.Oh and JK Simmons deserves a special mention here - it's almost worth watching the movie just to see him act and drop one-liners.How good actually is Tomorrow War?I'm going to watch it again this weekend and...God help me...I almost hope they make a sequel or prequel....yeah I know...bad call.Tomorrow War is enjoyable popcorn fun that you won't want to take a toilet break from.Remember when movies used to be fun?Tomorrow War is bringing that back.",The Tomorrow War

Therefore, it does not diminish the potential of the present; on the contrary, it even clears the demographics and lowers the average age. At the same time, you need to accumulate valuable resources and heavy weapons, so sending them is impractical.However, sending people out of the present does not affect events prior to their arrival, which means they travel through a multi-universe (as in «Rick and Morty», not in the «Back to the Future» movies) rather than a timeline. Therefore, even if you kill the family of the protagonist in the present, it will not change the future from the portal in any way.In other words, the future in its own universe is doomed to live out its destiny. The present will manage new information and build its own version of the future. If you build another ""time machine"", it will open a portal to the next point in the multi-universe.Of course, I may be wrong, the problem with the film marketers, they seemed to be deliberately trying to confuse the viewer.

961,krupocin-1,Mixed bag of good and bad: details below,5,3 July 2021,"Good: some of the cast, some of the visuals
Bad: the logic, even beyond the concessions we make for action, the acting at times is horrendousThis movie is super frustrating because it could've been an 8/10 but they just couldn't get out of their own way. It's a great concept and they seem to have had a massive budget to play with and a technically proficient crew. Yvonne Strahovski & Betty Gilpin (who is barely used) are the only solid performers. Chris Pratt, I like the guy a lot from his Andy Dwyer days, but wtf happened to his humor. He's just boring in this movie and without the thing that sets him apart, his humor and brand of comedy, you really notice what a bad actor he is haha. The scene in the hangar with JK Simmons where he says ""what?!"" seems like an outtake that was left in accidentally.Beyond that, the movie is just missing something. It's such an interesting concept that they just did so little with. Other reviewers have brought up the fact that the logic/plot is horrendous even for a fun action movie. This isn't Edge of Tomorrow, if you're watching this it's purely for the action fun...and here in lies the problem. That's all this is, a bland blockbuster that offers nothing below the surface, and that's fine, I was just hoping for more Aliens or T2 than Pacific Rim.

People can't fly! And what was up with that heat vision. That couldn't really happen.""It had great monsters rendered in believable CGI. The acting wasn't bad and I, for one, didn't think that the script was bad.Do you want to see a great movie with a great screenplay and great acting? That's why God gave us ""Casablanca.""

I'd go into great detail here about the flaws but that'd make this review longer than the movie.So suffice to say. Supposed summer block buster or not. If you're entertained by poorly conceived action scenes, big explosions, bad dialogue, illogical though processes and a story line so ridiculous that it makes Attack of the Killer Tomatoes look Academy Award worthy then give this movie a shot but remember you can't unsee it.And, to be honest I weep for the Hollywood that made movies with plausible story lines, great acting and entertainment value because if this is the best the modern day movie makers can come up with, the art of the Cinema is truly dead.",The Tomorrow War

I feel like all of the lead actors and actresses and supporting actors and actresses did an exceptional job!

But later on the movie rushes to the end with homemade science discovery and facts.Chris Pratt carries the whole movie in one piece and easily gives the best performance of all the characters. Though having very few scenes, Ryan kiera as young Muri leaves a mark. It's very disappointing to see how utterly wasted J. K Simmons talent by giving him a minor role where he plays a major role only at the end.

However, it feels like the movie was made by people who like sci-fi stuff but don't know enough about sci-fi movies. The movie just ignored time paradoxes without trying to solve them, relationships seem forced and the plot is rushed. It's so rushed in fact that the main plot is ignored entirely at the end for some neat action scenes.

The list is too long and I already wasted too much time on the movie.Seriously?

How can anyone get paid for writing this tripe?",The Tomorrow War
992,sarcasm83,I loved it for what it was; A creature feature action flick,9,15 July 2021,"I understand why some people might not like it.The occasional comic relief (which imo wasn't anywhere near as bad as in many, many, many similar films), the time travel ""plotholes"" (can we ever avoid them if we really think about how time travel would work ""realistically""?) and the ending where they instead ""do it themselves"" in a blaze of glory, than taking their time.However, I managed to entirely suspend my disbelief and to me, this was great action entertainment through and through. Pretty much exactly what I hoped for too.I especially found the creatures themselves to be incredibly cool.I don't remember when I've last been so fascinated by creature design ever since the Aliens and Predators. (The creatures, separately, NOT the AvP movie)How in the hallway, the creature ducks down low to press it's belly and neck to the ground on occasions, crawls on the wall so only it's back is facing the people shooting who rotate in the stairwell and in the end even is in the ceiling momentarily to protect being shot to it's vulnerable spots from below.Or how one of them slams the tentacles on both sides of the hallway, to the door structures and shrieks as loud as it can, to ensure the vibration of it's shriek will reverberate through the whole building from the structures.Or how another of them hops on a dumpster, shrieks and bangs the dumpster with it's tentacles to alert where the humans are.Or how one of them signals two others to attack from different sides, with it's head movement. (Easy to miss when they're on the street after coming out of the hospital)Sure, there are times when they're conveniently slower or more careless with protecting their squishy parts to enable fighting scenes to work, but I didn't find it to become too disruptive to the flick.Many reviews criticise how Chris Pratt's character want's to go back to the future timeline after manufacturing enough of the toxin, to save his daughter v2, because the timeline wouldn't work then, if they already had the toxin in the past - but... who in the movie is claiming that it would've ever worked like that? He's being sentimental, not accepting that the adult Muri will die.How do we even know this movie depicted the idea as ""one and the same timeline""?What if the timeline where the creatures escape and humanity loses will ALWAYS be like that.. that it has ""already happened"" on the future timeline (remember, the ""rafts always keep moving in time""), it's events ever unchanged no matter what happens in the past of the other timeline?Sure, they tried to ask help from one past timeline to help themselves, but at least ended up saving one alternate timeline from the same fate.If the two timelines are considered separate and unchanging, the toxin would NOT disappear when Pratt brings it to the past and kills the aliens, because he'd never negate the future adult Muri's timeline. That they're two different instances of time.Sure, whoever has only adopted the idea of timetravel that ""Back to the future"" depicted will have trouble with the plot, but I honestly didn't, as I never assumed it's like that.Oh and when they found the alien spaceship and decided to get rid of them then and there, I also found it careless and ""what if they'd set them free now?"", but in the end, whose to say the government wouldn't try to save them and use them as weapons themselves, or study them and screw it up anyway? They had a way to ensure they're killed; The toxin.Though sure, after some of them were killed, the rest woke up. But the toxin sure worked for the female creature. (I also loved the part where the creature bit off it's own arm... the kid in me whose a sucker for cool monsters and stuff was giddy as all hell at that point)Anyway, I was really entertained and truely liked the flick. Would honestly hope to see more of ""The white spikes"". Sure, would welcome if it was more fleshed out, more serious and better written, I won't deny that. Even still - creatures were cool, action was satisfying. Great popcorn flick, at least when not in company of people who enjoy nitpicking every inconsistency during watching.(If you didn't like it, I'm not saying you're wrong. Different tastes!)",The Tomorrow War
993,Yugeshan,War of Diversity,2,4 July 2021,"This movie should have been awesome, the concept while not original was pretty cool. The special effects and budget were good and the scale was massive. Unfortunately, its let down by a terrible script and even worse casting. Its similar to Edge of Tomorrow except they replaced 95% of the actors with women and black men. This is all well and good but it becomes unrealistic when every ranking military soldier or leader is a woman with several black guys standing next to her, literally. This is the same for almost all the dialogue, apart from the main character.",The Tomorrow War

995,Cinobite17,A Decent Film Let Down by Poor Writing and Wokeism,5,2 July 2021,"I wouldn't say don't watch it, because it does have some redeeming qualities and everyone loves Chris Pratt. But be ready for a heavy dose of current year.It's 2022, BLM won and now 70% of America is black. In fact, for the most part you'll be hard pushed to find 2 white men in a shot at the same time, save any family relationships. The commanders are, naturally, all women now, and the white men just canon fodder. Don't be fooled, Chris Pratt is the exception and even then plays second fiddle to his black and female co-stars. And in the third act prepare yourself for the ""climate change is why they're here"" plot device.Now, casting Chris Pratt in this scenario actually harms the film. Because so many seems are clearly purposely filled with black people and women, our white man stands out like a sore thumb and really pushes this problem home. I think if they had cast a black lead, this wouldn't have been so noticeable - like The First Purge, which was a black majority film and work fantastically with the black lead.But overall what really lets this movie down is the writing.For a 2hour 20min film, it's incredibly exposition heavy, with huge information dumps and characters telling each other what they already know. The future soldiers literally walk out of portal on a soccer pitch and the first words are ""we're you from the future, aliens have invaded and we need your help"". Straight away, everyone is onboard. The fact that people from the future just stepped out of a time portal to a live broadcast soccer match is never addressed again.So here's the premise.Chris Pratt is an ex special forces soldier now a biology teacher. He has a wife and kid.Future humans arrive and start to recruit current humans to take them into the future to fight the aliens. The whole recruiting is female, and it stands out. They do this within hours of recruiting them, they don't even change clothes, have zero training - one has a weapon but cant even put a mag in - and they're sent into the future to fight. So obviously they all die really quickly.Apart from Christ Pratt, our token mysterious black guy who's been 3 times to fight of his own accord, and our token black comedic relief guy.Oh, did I mention the aliens are all white, literally called white spikes and, of course, we're told the males are passive slaves and the females are super and better in every way.Anyway, female colonel turns up in barely impactful plot twist - it's his daughter, in the future. We knew this before the name drop because earlier his 9yo daughter said she wanted to grow up just like him in one of the many exposition dumps.Blah blah blah. The need a toxin to inject into the aliens to kill them, for that they need to capture the queen alien.After the queen kills several squads of white male highly trained future soldiers, Pratts daughter goes face to face with the queen, because she's a combat veteran and the top ranking military person in the future.They and several non white people escape with the queen while all the white men are butchered.Pratts daughter then works on making a toxin - because she's always a super scientist with PHD's from MIT. But they don't have enough materials to make it in the future and it's literally zero hour for them all. So Pratt has to take it back in time so they can make it and bring the made toxin into the future.He does. They can't. So Pratt enlists his dad as a pilot and takes team non-white to where they think the aliens ship crashed under the ice thousands of years ago (The Thing) to kill them in their sleep. Turns out the aliens who crashed aren't bad, the bad aliens are their planet destroying cargo (Prometheus)So they kill some, blow stuff up and then Pratt has a show down with the queen alien and wins. The End.It has some great set pieces, some nice (and not so nice) CGI and can, at times be really good. But the overall poor writing, lack of consistency, emotion, continuity and logic let it down.Writing Highlights include:Pratt goes to fight the future war with the black guy who's been 3 times in his squad. Yet Pratt is immediately put in charge despite having never been or seen an alien and not the black guy.They have an arm device that automatically jumps them back to the present after their mission of 7 days. Yet numerous times we see people who have returned and are missing arms that had the device on - how did they get back?They're sent to the future without knowing anything at all about the aliens, not even a picture, within hours of being drafted to the base. They have no uniforms issued but are all given M4's with every possible attachment known to man - even duplicates - which aren't even used. They of course have unlimited rounds in every mag.They have a time machine, the aliens don't arrive for years after the future soldiers arrive, so why are they sending people the moment they arrive at the base and not giving them training first?The obvious daughter twist is obvious.They fail to resolve the time paradox.It's a poorly written lift of Edge of Tomorrow, with a splash of The Thing, a dash of Prometheus and a little sprinkling or ""meeerrvvvv""/Interstellar.Watch it for Pratt and the random fun parts. But knowing the forced social politics going in might help ease the disappointment.5/10.",The Tomorrow War
996,solid-rock800,Good action movie,8,4 July 2021,"I really enjoyed this one. The acting was really good, the characters were relatable and entertaining, the action was good, the monsters were really cool and intimidating. It had some really interesting plot elements as well.My criticisms are that I had a few times where I was like, ""for future soldiers, these guys don't have a great sense of tactics"", which led to a few ""WHY are they doing that?"" moments. Including a bit near the end where there's a pretty big flaw, imo, in how they track down certain monsters (hopefully not giving away too much here). So it loses a couple stars for logic flaws in the story.But that said, if you want a good action movie with cool monsters and no politics, this is a solid choice and very enjoyable. I'll be recommending it to a few people I know!",The Tomorrow War

The Tomorrow War was thrilling, exciting, touching, heartwarming. I'm just a ball of emotions right now. I haven't been this jazzed about a scifi movie since Terminator 2 and i don't toss out praise like that easily. My one disappointment is that this couldn't have been experienced in a theater. While it was great watching The Tomorrow War at home, i really wish it could've had the theater screen treatment. Alas, what could've been. Amazon Prime you slammed it out of the ballpark with this one!!",The Tomorrow War

999,looking_Work,Not As Bad As Neflix Originals But Close To It,2,5 July 2021,The concept was great but the execution was poor (why there are 2 stars instead of 1). The movie was bad enough but got even worse when they tried to explain where the aliens came from. The acting was mediocre (Chris Pratt is good but no one could have saved this dumpster fire). You have to throw logic out of the window and you still will not be entertained. Once you understand who is being drafted and the 'training' that they receive then you will understand how this makes no sense. Aoid this movie unless you hate yourself.,The Tomorrow War
1000,riebroek,Highly enjoyable,8,4 July 2021,"Despite the obvious plotholes that even the best time traveling movies have it's just a solid enjoyable movie.It's nothing groundbreaking, there a paper thin script, you have the hero, the dork, the female badass, only 1 scientist saving the world, the family drama that's ends well in the end.But there's Chris Pratt, enjoyable as ever giving a solid performance.CGI is actually really good in this movie.I just really enjoyed this movie and I didn't fall asleep which is my personal way of telling it's a good or bad movie.Recommended!",The Tomorrow War
1001,francis007,"As an action movie - Ok, but once again the writers understand nothing about time travel",5,6 July 2021,"Since the logic of time travel is a subject I understand quite a bit, I really have a problem with all these movies and TV series that use the subject and fails miserably at the most basic points. It's a very complex subject and since it's impossible anyway in the real world, I guess that's to be expected but some coherency would be nice and once again - there is none at all. Nothing makes any sense and I can't take the movie seriously. It's very unusual to have fiction that deals with time travel seriously, Lost is the only one that comes to mind (not that this is the only way to do it well of course). This one is a failure.",The Tomorrow War

1003,enigmaticsince87,Disappointingly predictable. Predictably disappointing.,5,16 August 2021,"The moment I read the title ""The Tomorrow War"", I didn't have high hopes. It's not a terrible title, but it's hardly inspired either. And that's what this film is. Not terrible, but not good either. It is truly mediocre in almost every way. Let's break it down:THE GOODThe alien design is awesome. They're properly scary, resembling a hybrid of the Mimics from Edge of Tomorrow and Calvin from 2017's Life.Yvonne Strahovski, the actress playing the colonel, blew me away. Despite the awful dialogue she had to work with, her performance was superb. Unfortunately this only highlighted just how bad of a dramatic actor Pratt is. Speaking of which...THE BADChris Pratt. Oh Chris, I used to be such a fan. Please return to comedy. You don't have dramatic acting chops, and in this movie especially it really felt like you phoned it in.The script. It's so bad it's painful. So much exposition, I found myself fast forwarding entire dialogue scenes.A plethora of plot holes.",The Tomorrow War
1004,rrdeo22,Nothing outstanding.,5,18 July 2021,"This is typical 'time travel' 'save the world' hollywood drama, that too with lack of details. Its just one time watch. Nothing worth highlighting. Plot is not that convincing.",The Tomorrow War

1007,wingzero203,The Only Good White Spice...Is a Dead One!,7,3 July 2021,"What's interesting about this movie is that you get a sense of what it may really feel like if aliens invaded us and suddenly, every able-bodied man, woman, and child had to suit up and fight for the survival of humankind (like casually putting on a chest rig and belt & pistol holster over your yoga outfit). I also wouldn't second guess the time travel logic (I'm still confused from Endgame) and just go with it. There are moments that are bit clichéd (estranged family members come together under a common threat) and scenes that are definitely far out of left field but it's still an enjoyable flick. You can tell Chris Pratt is channeling his inner Navy SEAL/Zero Dark Thirty role during his missions and plays the confident (but humble) protagonist.This movie is watchable, farfetched, and interesting but done just right. Don't overthink it and don't take it too seriously. Just turn off your brain and enjoy!",The Tomorrow War
1008,marcadams-21925,Average Sci-Fi Action Film,5,3 July 2021,"Entertaining and watchable but don't expect miracles or anything moving. Chris Pratt unfortunately is showing his limitations again. I believe he could really break the type cast mould but not by doing a film like this. As many have said this feels like anl cheesy 90's movie, but also takes various concepts from other sci-fi movies and adapts them slightly then mixes them all together (Prometheus meets Edge of Tomorrow sprung to mind). Watch it but don't expect too much.",The Tomorrow War
1009,Manolo2001,Could've been so much better,5,9 July 2021,"Where do I start ??I think the movie went from sci-fi to sci-joke when the future people showed up.Look, spoilers !!!, people came to the past, from the future to get help killing some aliens that were overrunning them. OK, fair enough, they pick and choose who goes etc. But at some point we are told that these aliens were already on earth at the point in time when they go back. Soooooo, why would you even bother taking people to the future when you could just hunt for those aliens before they make a mess of things. To be clear, logic simply jumps out the window.After this, to me at least, the movie was just a well made joke.It is entertaining, has a lot of actiong, CGI is really good, in general this makes for the 5 stars, otherwise it would have been just 1 or 2.",The Tomorrow War

All this entertainment to come down to the issue of all that happened is climate change and the creatures killed mankind.Really stupid.It is worth watching for the pure scifi entertainment but it is a bit mind numing and i found playing a game on my phone more entertaining.,The Tomorrow War
1013,genham,Kinda fun if you leave your brain in another room,7,17 July 2021,The film is a multitude of films in one and does it's hardest to cram them all in. It has to skip over major questions to fit but If you are happy to just go along for the ride without thinking it's actually a really enjoyable and tense film. The frustrating element is when you finally find out that what's killing everyone is perhaps just a weapon of some sort or 'pet' even of some advanced alien race you really want to understand more but it's not about that. Shame really as that could have been really cool. Still worth a watch on a Friday night.,The Tomorrow War
1014,KatoC,Cheap shot at Cruises Edge of Tomorrow,4,17 July 2021,"There is nothing new or original about this movie, except maybe, that the aliens were brought to us by yet other aliens (maybe as a preparation for a future sequel, where the transporters turn out to be even worse a menace). Anyway, CGI is indeed very good, the alien is successfully being anthropomorphized, in its moves, gestures etc. I have absolutely no idea what J. K. Simmons is doing here. Did his wife leave him, has he gotten bored? Either way, not one inch of his talent comes to use or life here. Kiera Armstrong is great. Good job. The rest you can guess from the trailer. Watch Edge of Tomorrow. That's the one that's good. This one - I don't know.",The Tomorrow War

1016,win_kk,The best movie I have seen in Covid time,10,20 August 2021,"I have seen so many new movies out but not impress with any of them except this one and Cruella. Hitman wife bodyguard suck. So is Jungle Cruise, Space Jam, Wonder Woman 2, Tenet, Mortal Kombat, Tom and Jerry, Mulan, Ray and the last Dragon. I can go on. Snake Eyes and Suicide Squad are the worst one. Even Conjuring 3 and Quiet Place 2 look better than this. Black Widow was alright but not very exciting or interesting as Salt.Anyway, this Tomorrow War is really great in term of storyline, acting from Chris and the whole thing just make sense. I think this is good as The Edge of Tomorrow. Not sure why most movies from Hollywood in the lockdown just terrible. Thank god that we still have a couple of good one.All I can say is go watch it. Really good. Interesting story and fair amount of action. Not too crazy like John Wick, shooting non stop. Not pure action but balanced. I didn't get bored at all. Still want to watch second time. Netflix and Amazon movies are now better than some of the movies on the cinema.",The Tomorrow War
1017,dannair,Enjoyed the first half of the film but then it gets weird,6,15 July 2021,"The initial set up is brilliant but (Spoilers ahead!!!) once Chris Pratts character comes back from the future, the writing and the acting all goes for a toss. Infact the whole Antartica scene plays out like a comedy film which is at complete odds with what transpired before that. The final scene where Chris Pratt is fighting this gigantic alien bigger than an elephant with a tiny claw had me face palming and the crazy part is he actually kills the alien! After all this all Chris has is a scratch on his face! It almost felt like mid way through filming they realised the movie is being sold to Amazon due to Covid so they decided to just wrap this up and move on and yea now this is a comedy. Credit where its due the alien CGI is probably the best I've ever seen in a movie in a long time.",The Tomorrow War
1018,sysgoddess,Something for almost everyone,8,22 July 2021,I convinced my husband to watch it with me tonight and we thoroughly enjoyed it While there were minor inconsistencies throughout they did not detract from our enjoyment particularly given the otherwise great effects.It was predictable on occasion but again not to serious detriment of the film as a whole.The movie seemed a little long but not so much that we felt compelled to fast forward at any point.I recommend this movie for adults who enjoy science fiction and I would watch it again.,The Tomorrow War
1019,Mary1337hax,USA military cult?,2,31 July 2021,"What is it with the US and their love for military? No wonder they're so brainwashed with loving their military and ""dying for their country"" when movies are bombarded with the propaganda.Its such a boring movie therefore. I don't understand how they can brainwash them so hard. Like its CRINGE watching those scenes. Its not fun watching someone say ""time to serve your country"" like no let them decide themselves if they want to die.Btw, apparently that's Chris Pratt...",The Tomorrow War
1020,MJBlazin,Good summer movie - Chris Pratt does what Christ Pratt does well,8,3 July 2021,"The movie has three acts, each of about the same duration. That makes it longer than typical at 139 minutes. The third act is the weakest on logic, but you get the conclusion that you likely expected. The consistent themes are family and sacrifice, emphasis on sacrifice. A lot of people die in the movie and it's probably not good for smaller children. Gore is a little less than the Tom Cruise/Emily Blunt monster war movie. Just about every character that you meet, and it has a lot of them, gets an action scene. They are not just red shirts on Star Trek. For J. K. Simmons fans, you may wonder where he went. He is not a cameo and he is important to the plot.My guess is the movie would have done fairly well in theaters. This is not the Wahlberg Infinites movie or the Cloverfield Paradox dumped on streaming because the studio did not know what to do with it.",The Tomorrow War
1021,JARA-3,And this script is supposed to be good?,1,10 July 2021,"Many reviewers have picked over plot holes. I keep looking for some place where the plot make sense. I genuinely cannot find any line of dialogue or plot step that adds up. Job interviews being conducted outside of business hours? Americans watching the World Cup? The whole plot turns on enough global warming to let the aliens melt out. That much ice melt and Miami Beach is underwater. So you can either have global warming and aliens or you can have Miami beach but you can't have both. Nobody is going to walk down seven flights of stairs and then run without lots of training. And if all you're going to do is to send the toxin back in time to have it made there, why don't you just plan to blow up the alien spaceship? And yes of course this man's talisman, the alien claw that he has been polishing over and over throughout the movie, still has enough ash on it to be identified? The fellow who melted down and hid from the whole experience has no signs of PTSD, and is able to go back to work like it was nothing to it.I couldn't tell if the acting was any good or not because I couldn't make sense of the words coming out of their mouths. What good are good effects if the story there telling makes no sense? And they're already talking about a sequel?Some other critics say just relax and enjoy the show. I hate to think what I'd have to do to be able to relax and enjoy this. Heroin maybe?",The Tomorrow War

The acting performance of all the actors are above average and Chris Pratt is as always brilliant on what he does.The demerit of the movie is its sceeenplay which fails to make a connection between us the viewers and the characters of the movie. Its runtime of 2 hours and 18 minutes is something that's bad about this movie.Overall, this is a fun ride and you can enjoy this movie if you do have enough time.",The Tomorrow War

But it still pains from western mediocrity and social rot that steers the movie makers to care more about how many races are represented and how many genders and yadada. If they cared more about storytelling, this could've actually be a great movie. I gave it a 6 because it's better than the previous load that includes time travel, where people made a movie ""with a twist"" that they didn't know how to write well, they just built screens around the idea - filled with CG. Come to CG, this movie has it right in a way, it's not too much and it's not looking completely detached from physics. But in the end, it's just mediocre. Shooting at rudimentary feelings, funny black guy, lonely strong black guy, white guy who cares for family... This is why, when I want to watch a proper movie, I watch things made east of UK (UK included). Can the NA movie industry stop recycling and revolving around USA social issues, or just cease to exist?

And apparently they have a toxin that kills all the males. Why is it necessary to kill the females then?And what's up with the alien monsters not freezing solid in the ice? Do they not freeze?Assuming you know anything about geology, they would have been buried there in that ship in the ice for at least 70,000 years since the beginning of the last ice age...so wouldn't the aliens have died from starvation (assuming they don't freeze)? Remember, humans are apparently food, so they like and need to eat.I could go on and on with the plot holes like the one you mentioned.If we know 30 years ahead of time, why couldn't we just nuke the ship? It apparently only took less than an day to find with almost no effort or advanced technology.Why wouldn't the governments of the world have ""listened"" to the last soldiers to return from the future, especially a highly trained ex-military soldier?

Great acting from most of the cast. Some side characters are just okay with line delivery. CGI is phenomenal, but makes sense with an Amazon budget. Score is totally underrated. Was thinking it was Junkie XL or Hans Zimmer, turned out to be composed by Lorne Balfe, you may be surprised what movies he's worked on so look up his wiki or IMDB.Chris Pratt is always good no complaints there.As a whole I think this was a fun and enjoyable film, sort of like 1996's Independence Day except for one thing, this film had an amazing first 45 minutes of build up, but the climax and third act was not nearly as entertaining.Have fun, watch with friends.",The Tomorrow War

Support cast are good and although I'm not a huge fan of Pratt, he holds it together very well.Some poor scripting, plotting and unrealistic science don't distract from fast pacing and horribly scary aliens.It does draw from some recent sci-fi/fantasy flicks and is very reminiscent of Matt Damon vehicle the Great Wall with chunks of Predator and Alien franchises thrown in for good measure as well as Thing-esque climax. Considering it comes at no extra cost to Prime subscribers this is a worthy summer movie, if not a perfect blockbuster.",The Tomorrow War
1047,visionaforethought,Great VFX but woke cast and dicipline,7,27 August 2021,"Whilst the visuals and aliens were big screen movie quality, it was obvious that like recent Battlefield and COD games, history or common sense and biology has been discarded to continue the dishonest narrative of woke. 1. Most leading characters not white. Not accurate representation of real society. 2. The random people chosen to be impromptu soldiers were untrained and either obese or just not tough enough. In reality, within seconds, not minutes, of being dropped into battle they would collapse from exhaustion if not suffering panic attacks or heart failure. Life is not a video game.",The Tomorrow War

1050,LivingWitness,Decent action; good special effects,7,9 July 2021,"If you're going into this movie expecting it to be a highly intelligent movie, you're probably better off watching something else. The Tomorrow War is very much your standard action movie that doesn't need a whole lot of intelligence to get.I don't think it's as dumb as other reviews have made it out to be. It's probably about as dumb as your standard MCU movie. If you're generally okay with that level of intelligence in a movie, you'll be fine with The Tomorrow War as well. This is definitely a lot smarter than anything Michael Bay has put out ever.The CGI is pretty good, and is the best part of this movie. The White Spikes look amazing. They're easily some of the best creatures that I've ever seen in a creature feature like this.I think the CGI really lets the performances in this movie shine. A lot of actors really seem to struggle with acting well in a CGI heavy movie like this one, so to see Chris Pratt and the rest of the cast doing as well as they did is pretty impressive.I think what really lets The Tomorrow War down is that its action scenes aren't quite as intense as they could be. They're good, but I think it would have been better if they had have really doubled down on the intensity and made them even more off the walls. Hopefully this is an aspect that the sequel does better with, though.Overall, I think The Tomorrow War is a good movie. There's definitely places where the movie could have done better, but there isn't really anything that ruins it either.",The Tomorrow War

1056,iknowhwoyouare,A Confusing and Dumb Movie,1,20 August 2021,"What a pity and waste of ideas! A movie that falls apart instantly under the heavy burden of dumbness. Blunders all over. A ridiculous way to waste celluloid.Honestly: how much better this movie could be without the war in the future, instead, doing everything in the present.Let's start with this elephant in the room:
30 years from now, mankind will have been decimated. Only a few left. They don't even have weapons enough. They lose territory, civilization collapsed, nothing remains.But they instead of focusing on new weapons, they resolve the impossible: time travel. Because resolving time-travel is much more easier than anything else.This time travel was so ridiculously solved that it only makes me cry. A room where lights open on the wall and people start to fly up? Seriously?Is the average movie-goer so dumb these days that everything goes?Then the future solders forcefully send a handful of absolutely unprepared ""normal"" citizens with ridiculously useless guns to the future, where:
1) these monsters already have killed 8 billion people just like that (much more prepared solders);
2) they are mostly immune to and protected against handguns.How low this movie can be?Now, let's see the job of this makeshift task force: To secure a research facility in a completely devastated and dead city. Seriously? What were those researchers doing alone in the completely killed city??? What were they doing without food, electricity, supplies, surrounded by monsters? Why weren't they rescued beforehand by the much more prepared future soldiers? So, the lady scientist instruct the time-traveled soldiers to bring the blue ampules from the facility to the HQ.Those are not blue and not ampules! Those were transparent polypropylene 14 mL Falcon tubes with blue screw caps. If she is a real lady scientist, she should know that.The is makeshift crew then brings this serum on them - in the middle of the complete annihilation of the city by carpet-bombing. How convenient! The future of mankind depends on those ""ampules"", so time travel is created for unprepared citizens to do the job that not even future army could do - and then the future army just bombs them with napalm. Why not to order the destruction of what is left, including the hard-transported past time makeshift commando! How intelligent this movie is!Chris Pratt and Co. Are able to run away from the heavy explosions that just happen a few meters from them, but the superfast and heat/water/explosion/bulllet/toxin resistant monsters die like flies in the autumn. What an IDIOT MOVIE!Then the lady scientist during one night resolves the question of the toxin. She did not even need those tubes rescued, as she draws blood directly from the queen (a reference to Aliens).She even admits that it is a one man's job. So, if she was able during one single night alone to find the weapon against the monsters, why did they create time travel??? What is this movie about, sorry? Did the writers smoke something before coming up with the plot?Finally, the story ends with the alien spaceshift.These monsters were kept in a fluid-filled membrane bag. They were not awaken when the ship crash-landed, but awoke when Pratt and Co. Enter there. If those were so horrendous creatures, why weren't they kept under a fortress??? Why would these other aliens travel with the terrible monsters in their back, secured only with a membrane?There is not a single second in this movie that makes any sense. What a big shame!",The Tomorrow War

It wasn't trying to be something that it's not.This is a 9/10 for me because I was looking for a fun action + adventure film and to be honest, I had low expectations. Surprisingly, from the start of the movie literally up until the end, I was on the edge of my seat and nothing distracted me whatsoever. My focus was completely on the plot and characters.For me I think Pratt seriously did an amazing job, along with Yvonne. Chris Pratt in every movie he's in manages to capture the audience's attention and his aura doesn't scream cheezy movie star. Compared to The Rock (whom I love very much) wherein his characters seem a little too over the top. But I get it, you know. It's cheesy cinema and they're here to entertain.I think the missing 1 star for me were just the plot holes and how a lot of the dubbed awesome scenes happened to appear out of nowhere. Honestly if they just gave me a dumb explanation of why this and that occurred and HOW, I would have taken it LOL. Nevertheless, I think I can manage to look past that because again, I was so so entertained and I think people need to go into this movie without award-winning-worthy expectations because all they're trying to do is provide us with a fun blockbuster sci-fi.",The Tomorrow War

He delivers a good performance in a mediocre at best script. If you try not to.think too much about the plot, it's an entertaining movie that runs about 20 minutes too long. The plot was actually a cool idea that they just didn't execute well. The movie delivers all of the typical progressive talking points we've come to expect from the kids at Amazon including climate change. As expected, they discriminate against one particular group in terms of casting and how they're portrayed in the movie in order to elevate others.

1068,jcsallows,Supringly good,7,3 July 2021,"If you've seen just one of the trailers, you know what you're getting yourself into. This isn't genre-defining nor winning any academies; this movie is popcorn movie fun. If it's safe enough, I'd suggest watching this in theaters or IMAX because this movie is designed for that. The action sequences and special effects are beyond over-the-top.I want to get what's bad out of the way first. The story makes just enough sense for you not to question significant plot points. As for other things like how scenes play out, dialogue, and most character justifications - the logical side of your brain will find this movie frustrating. The action is very artificial, literal leaps in logic to force the following action sequence and, if you haven't completely turned off your brain, you'll notice it quickly. The overall story plods to get back to explosions as soon as possible and progress to an oddly satisfying ending.So, if you like interesting characters and good storytelling, look elsewhere. But everything else: acting, CGI and special effects, action sequences, comic relief, and monster designs are either passable or surprisingly good. I want to note, the acting in this movie is impressive; with the ridiculousness and sloppily put together character developments, every actor knocks their performances out of the park considering the schlocky script given to them. The dialogue at times (especially with Chris Pratt) is super cringe, but it works (mostly) because these actors are so believable as these characters...err, Hollywood versions of these characters.If you want action, explosions, Chris Pratt family man, guns blazing, alien invasion, time travel, CGI, and post-apocalyptic America, here it is. Some scenes are well shot, but it's borrowing from past, more iconic action movies. I know the critics will say this movie is derivative of its genre, but you should have easily picked that up from the trailers.

So yes, all the complaints about the nonsensical plot, and the pointless use of time travel are there, but I've seen plenty of action movies with equally ridiculous plots that are nevertheless fun to watch.Despite a big budget, star cast and pretty cool monster design, the film falls short of delivering even on my low expectations due to bad editing and weird cinematography. A lot of the scenes where we see the aliens aren't terrifying, because they fail to build suspense. You know they scenes in horror movies where you have an eerie silent moment, right before something comes out screaming, and you jump out of your seat? They set these scenes up at least three times in the, movie, but the tension of the silence is broken right before the big reveal by a split-second of goofy dialogue which I guess is supposed to be humorous. So that big ""yikes"" moment ends up just falling flat.The alien design itself was truly gruesome and horrifying, but they were rendered dull to watch by the way the action played out screen. Better editors could've made this movie so much better than what it was.Ultimately, the horrible plot line and ridiculously idiotic writing was unable to be saved by the budget and SFX, due to bad editing, directing and cinematography. Altogether, a waste of time.The fact that $200 million was spent to produce this garbage, just proves that Hollywood is NOT a meritocracy. I've seen far more talented and better amateur film makers and writers out there on YouTube and social media making indie films with their own money. These days, Hollywood is an exclusive club where people in the know get greenlit for multi-million dollar projects, and even when those projects fail miserably, they still get work because they're in the club for life.",The Tomorrow War

World's military might can't win against armored, swift but not too bright killer species but the species has no tech, nor air power...Starship troopers. They have ravenous appetites but for thousands of years the queen reproduced and created an army of these killers without any noticeable decline in the surrounding Russian wildlife population... Oh wait...they suddenly rose up from some place in Siberia where if knowing the Russians would have had little issue with nuking if they got overrun with alien lifeforms.I get it...I CAN suspend my belief if the enemy were believable (ID4) or AI e.g. Terminator but these creatures were lower lifeforms who just wanted to eat. No strategy. Eat and procreate, move to where the food is. Find the Queen, nuke or JDam or cruise missile her ass, game over.Not a cheap movie but writing was so linear, the big reveal was pushed aside by the SECDEF as incredulous even after time travelers have been conscripting earthers to fight in the future.

Great CGI effects.Acting is on spot (i love Yvonne Strahosvki, very happy to see her in a big role like this).Minor itches (hero getting above veteran's rank, no big name wearing any helmet ever and some other hollywoodismes...).Definitely a big movie in my book.

The 40+ would enjoy the Terminator-like dark alternate futures, I think. Still, the explanations given were satisfactory, apart from the fact that when he returned to his present, his future-grown-up daughter described him a different timeline than the one that he followed in the movie, which is difficult to assess, unless a different set of events had taken place (the classical Terminator paradox). Again, by attempting to explain this, you swirl down a dark rabbit hole.The aliens were....top notch! The Alien Queen was a B-i-t-c-h as all Alien Mums are :)For me, a tear-jerker scene was when he returned to his present and saw his 9 year-old daugther. I found that scene to be the best in the whole movie.The last 20-30 minutes that involved man-made climate change was an excellent twist of we-brought-this-to-ourselves scenario.

Sure the idea is cool but for a movie with war in the title there sure is a lot of talking in it.In a way the movie feels like it was a tv series, but somehow money started to run out and they decided to make it a movie.That's the only reason i can think they introduce some characters half hearted and then have them killed off. Oh no , that dude died, oh no shirt lady and plus sized guy, no not them them too""there is an environmental message in there, but its to much of a happy slapping metaphor then anything else. And in that it misses the mark, and kinda comes of as preachy, and seeing this is an amazon movie the anti government sentiment in the movie is....wow its....yeah something else , something else really preachy.And yes i am sure others have said it before , the plot holes and stupid stuff that happens can be a bit distracting.But the fact that nobody else thought about checking out the claws of the creatures and that the past people had to discover that it came from a Chinese super volcano, and a space ship that crash landed in Russia, its just.

Mix that with some stereotypical characters and wrap it in a time-travel blanket.This is a great action movie, the aliens are nasty and I liked the good guys. Thought there was good suspense throughout, and yes, I like OT sentimental in these summer blockbusters.Remember - this was made as a entertainment, not to win a scientific nobel prize.I love time travel movies, yes there are paradoxes throughout, I was thinking about all of them all day and will for a while... I mean that's what makes time travel/loop films fun isn't it?Thinking of other movies... If you think Independence Day feel, but mix with Aliens, war of the worlds, Starship Troopers (and yes thought it was thankfully graphic and scary in places - I always have doubts of a film with a 12 rating)...

For example when Chris Platt was bringing the toxin back to the present he was so worried about Mary in the future dying while she needed to die in order for the present Mary to live. Also if the bomb they blew up at the end worked why did they need the toxins so much. Another thing at the end part is that they had 30 more years until the aliens attacked,but they instead decided to fight them by themslelves while they could get a bigger crew.But other than the logic in some parts ecerything was incredibly good.( this review is written by my daughter :) )",The Tomorrow War

If you can however ignore flaws in time travel theories like in the Terminator or the Star Trek movies you'll be thoroughly entertained for 2 hours.

Why not use the time, the years they still have, to prepare for the coming of the aliens? Sending soldiers to the future seems utterly pointless compared to prepairing to have an ample defence force ready by the time the aliens come.2) since they have invented time travel, the future people should evacuate all remaining humans (500.000) to the past where they can devote their lives to create the so much needed defence force3) I can only imagine what more stupidity is written in the story. I'm feeling insulted (because the movie producer presumes I (as the audience) am too dumb to see the obvious story failures) and stopped watching this movie. It seems to be made for profoundly stupid people. Appearently this is a big market (The US seems to have a lot of those) so, good job.Three stars for the obvious production value.

Though you shouldn't expect much when IMDB's mothership is financing it, or buying it.The feel of the movie is strange too, as well as the ambiance. It feels like someone thought everyone in the world was dumb and they could pass this plot off as the only chance for humanity. But they left so much time and room for speculation of why the dumbest solution was the one they chose? I guess this is a prequel to Idiocracy?Ambiance was typical warfare with a grimy filter over the entire movie. I guess that hide the horrible CGI (at times was decent though), or the bad prop making.

Even castlevania has a lot of fools talking smack and acting like they can do better. So sick of 1 star ratings being done to actual movies and entertainment that is remotely descent or at least entertaining.This movie should at least sit in a 7.5, at least.IF you are wondering whether you should watch it... here's your list.Do you like sci fi?Do enjoy bad ass aliens?Do you enjoy bad ass fight scenes and war flicks?Do you enjoy believable characters?Do you like films that make sense for the situation the characters are in (though the science could have been explored more)?Do you appreciate great cgi?

1151,davittennis,Put a seat belt on your couch and strap yourself in!,10,2 July 2021,"Hands down one of the best Sci-Fi films I have ever seen.Well acted, well scripted, top notch nay incredible special fx, terrifying creatures, insane scenario, awesome pacing, great casting, appropriate balance of humour/horror/tears and twists. Oh and lots and lots and lots stuff blowing up.There wasn't any flat spots where I lost interest or got confused or even felt like I could pause to go get a drink or go to the loo and when I did tear myself away I seemed to be in a rush to get back to it.Reading some of the low score reviews I realise some had higher expectations, some found the tropes too cliche etc. Me I just enjoy a film for what it is and appreciate all the hard work that goes in to them for our entertainment. So I chose not too get too caught up in the feasibility of the science etc and just went with the multilayered narrative.If you love Sci-Fi (leaning heavily into horror to justify the reality of the story) you simply must see this and I hope it's a TEN for you too!Warning this is not a family/kids film. These creatures are genuinely scary and there is a lot of believable death and destruction. Perhaps teens, check your local rating. But definitely not for kids.Just awesome ppl.",The Tomorrow War

My mind immediately jumped to ""Oh, this is just another Edge of Tomorrow.""Fast forward, I am in visiting my in-laws, and everyone wants to watch something. This came up, and I thought ""Aw, why not?""I skimmed a few reviews before mine, saw a couple I agreed with and didn't. It's a time travel movie, so time travel in any story presents problems. Some mentioned the film length as an issue. Others said the plot was simplistic.Fair, but let's remember what genre the film is. It's a summer blockbuster. Blockbuster films are action-packed, fun, and easy entertainment. The genre aim isn't deep philosophical questions, intrinsic plots, and/or phenomenal character development. The aim for fun and entertainment with popcorn and friends.It's a simple plot. Aliens invade earth, a war rages in the future, and humanity is fighting for its own survival, ala Terminator. The characters have static arches. The visuals are astounding. The film score is heart pounding. The action takes off and then slows for a breather before the climax. Good pacing.Here is where the film does surpass the typical. The supporting cast is endearing and genuinely funny. I laughed multiple times at a couple characters.If you want to watch something riveting and fun on a Saturday night, this one is for you.",The Tomorrow War

But at times, the clichés are obvious, and make you wonder if those parts were uninspired, or just placeholder moments that they never tried to make more unique. There are times when the ""plan"" is a bit inane, and you remember you're watching an action movie that spent all its ambition in the first act. Still, it's fun.

Awesome reveal.I couldn't entirely predict the story line but I did think it would be cool for someone in the past to be able to meet someone they knew as an older version in the future. They executed that well.Only criticism I have is that if they had killed the female when she started screaming the rig wouldn't have been overrun by the White spikes quite so overwhelmingly and maybe his daughter would have survived.

The plot is nuts, and probably full of holes (not that I would notice) but sci-fi needs to be like that some days or the movies wouldn't make it out of the ideas stage. I feel like I witnessed some epic scenes and I would love a sequel, although not sure where they would go with it.A few annoyances, why does every single damn monster/alien make the same guttural clicking sound nowadays, are they all related? The sound effects department needs a reprimand for being completely unoriginal. And the sound track?

1177,proaditya95,Way better than what I was expecting,8,3 July 2021,"First of all, the design of Whitespikes is among the best I have ever seen in film. The way they move, attack and their presence in a scene carries weight and is intimidating.Near the climax the She (Queen) bites her limb off to prevent further infection and the way she does it tells that how every species strives for survival and to what length some can go. Truly jaw dropping.The music also is not generic or typical and it moved me throughout the film. Lorne Balfe should get nominated for an Oscar here.The performances were good if not excellent and Sam Richardson as Charlie is funny. He is the source of humour in this film (that stairs scene when they first encounter the beasts).Action, visual effects are of high quality though in some scenes one can notice the use of virtual (green screen) if one looks for it.The story and the plot is obviously not original and the time travel concept is a genre of its own.The thing that I found to be inconsistent is the ending. Dan and his father two people are able to deal with the Queen alone while earlier in the film, with harpoons they had trouble not to mention much more soldiers too. Yes, I know they had the toxin but she bites that limb off like it was a finger nail. Also, and this is just a personal preference but the ending is comforting. And I was actually anticipating some kind of background for the aliens like where they came from or how they crashed (or who weaponised them). Maybe a prequel film about this?!Like maybe they were the ones who caused the aliens to break out and attack them in the future or something. But that's just my opinion and I'm sure many people will love the ending as it is.So, in conclusion a solid package filled with some awe inspiring moments and aliens that will haunt you for days to come :)",The Tomorrow War

A good writer could make the movie work after Pratt returned to ""now"". Just getting the future poison that can save the world back in time does not save the world. There is a story to tell how the poison was used to fight the future invasion. The way this movie does it is not even close to plausible. There is so many possibilities to make an amazing ending for this otherwise great movie. I find it hard to understand how this version of the movie got released.

It focus too much on the lead actor that i just cannot see any involvement from the supporting cast. They should've explore more for other character's.

Why not just send everyone back to the past and then spend the next 30 years preparing for the invasion?

Why not just draft people earlier and give them months of training?

How many spikes does each alien have inside their arms and how fast can they regenerate them? They invented space travel but can't make guns? They have vulnerable throats and bellies, but rear up and expose them every time they are about to attack?If they like eating people so much, wouldn't it make sense to farm them matrix style instead of just killing them all and running out of snacks?Do the aliens literally have no anti-aircraft technology even though they can space travel? Don't they have bombs? Can't they just bomb the 'hidden' time travel portal in the middle of the ocean? Do they lack radar?Did they not bother to conduct any form of intelligence gathering to asses the enemy capabilities?I'm not sure how this movie got funded, but I think everyone involved was half asleep and just hoping people would see 'OMG Chris Pratt' and then watch it...Save yourself the 2 hours and watch some paint dry.

You'll cheer just as loud as you would in a movie theatre when the aliens are eventually defeated.Has the classic storyline with alien reptiles who breed and overrun the earth with humans as their food supply. With only 500,000 humans left in 2051, a small platoon jump back to 2022 in a last ditch effort to recruit volunteers to jump into the future to fight for the extinction of the human race.Volunteers are notified of their draft status via a text on their cell phone and to avoid a time paradox, the inscripted are typically over 40 and must have died before 2051. These ragtag recruits are untrained, few are fit for duty and only 1 in 5 survive the week long tour of duty.

Read on for some more cool fresh observations. I love that the alien threat isn't actually revealed until we are right there for the reveal, a good headway into the movie length. I genuinely thought it would be Chris Pratt fighting themselves from another future or something along these lines. It's not.One thing I didn't expect going into this movie was the humour. It's not bad and shines when is surfaces in the right moments. J. K. Simmons is just leagues apart from the other actors, it's amazing to witness and he delivers his lines great.But make no mistake it's an action drama that has all the checkmark clichés and tropes and themes. Troubled past, Vietnam trauma, daughter dad drama, dad-dad drama, DNA-string-footage emphasising breakthrough speed science, untrained civilians doing extreme strenuous military tasks without sweating. Lot's of holes. The main one probably being conflict-of-interest. If the survival of the human species is at stake, you probably would not have a daughter and a dad having a go at this and all the drama that involves.Another aspect that did not make sense is that if the alien threat can smell blood over many miles. Why would menstruating women be enlisted? At least in the Pitch Black (2000) (Riddick) they addressed that issue.The premise is actually not bad and has a lot of potential going. The first half hour is great and got me really hooked. The execution is so and so.",The Tomorrow War
1200,MarkAylwyn,Solid Action Fare,8,2 July 2021,"So ok, better than I'd been lead to believe with some of the critic reviews prior to release.Gotta say unfortunately that it's not Pratt's best ever performance but hell, the source material just isn't Guardians, so unfair to compare really. Overall it was solid performances by all the cast and of course JK was excellent. The standout performance was Strahovski though - she was exceptional.Pretty awesome directing for McKay's first live action feature too.This is definitely a great popcorn movie. Had some great moments and some genuine surprises. It's not going to change your perspective on the world but then it's not designed to. I did feel it missed some opportunities to further the theme of the parent / child relationship that could have been dealt with a little deeper, but TBH, it delivered exactly what was on the tin.Do try to watch this on a large screen as the action scenes are worth it. Shame it missed the intended theatrical release.Hope you enjoy it as much as I did.",The Tomorrow War
1201,Nitro85,"If you find a plothole, you can keep it...",5,10 September 2021,"Its your average CGI spectactle with some good acting, some bad acting, some good dialogues, some cringeworthy dialogues and so on. But its an enjoyable movie. Its even good paced and the boring parts doesnt stretch too long.But: To some degree, i am very willing to just switch my brain off and enjoy a movie, however... there were things i just couldnt oversee cause they literally gave me a headache.So lets summarize the major ones: They send civilians without telling them what theyre even fighting against, theyre basically useless cannonfodder. Even worse, theyre basically sending free food for the aliens.Why not wait, build thousands of drones and C-RAMs and send them instead of cannonfodder? Have you ever seen a C-RAM in action??? Watch it on youtube and than tell me if the aliens would stand a chance, against that and drones dropping incendiary bombs or mininukes all day. And they all can be operated by humans far far away from the battlefield or even work autonomous, so not a single soul needs to die while fighting the aliens.Why dont they send us some dead aliens? In the future theres no scientists and laboratories left, accepted, but were in the present now and if the worlds scientist would come together, im sure the figure out a biological weapon in no time and here it can be mass produced.Last but not least: You found the alien ship on earth, but you tell no one cause youre affraid no one will believe you? (movies explanation, not mine)
Future humans came out of a wormhole, time traveled in the past cause they are fighting against f...ing aliens in the future, everybody on earth knows that than, every government knows that than. Everybody knows it will happen in 30 years and everybody doesnt know where the aliens came from.If you would tell them, by the time the 30 years passed, the aliens would wake up, with their ship burried deep underground in a concrete dome, surrounded by all the worlds military forces and scientist already waiting to stick cables and hoses in every of their holes... If the aliens not already wake up, strapped to a table ready to be experimented on.And lets not forget the decades old discussion, could zombies, mutants, dragons, creatures, aliens overrun all the worlds military forces? No, the answer is simply no. Cause we humans, stupid as we are, have perfectioned every possible way of killing each other, so that applies to every other living thing too, if it lives, we can kill it, for sure.",The Tomorrow War

1212,reaver-05515,"Making Time Travel Dumb, since 2021",6,20 August 2021,"I'm usually pretty hard on movies that have stupid plots, which sadly TTW has in spades. I mean, with all those script supervisors, producers, writers, nobody noticed the backbone of the movie had scoliosis?That being said, this movie does at least have it's redeeming features.Firstly the action is quite exciting. And it is an action movie, so that's always a bonus when that happens. The fight choreography and overall pace are all good. I was pretty well ""gripped"" by the opening combat sequence.Of course the situations are ridiculous, and people throw themselves needlessly into them, in order to make it more action-packed, but it is fast paced and fun. So you can forgive a bit of stupidity.Likewise, the characters, if a little 2D, are fun to watch. Pratt admirrably manages to balance humour, charm and feeling. And the supporting cast all put in a solid effort.There are some seriously clichéd lines and overly heroic ""I'm not doing it for my country...I'm doing it for loooove"" kinda BS, but you can mostly take those with a chuckle, and move on.The CG beasts are pretty nicely designed. They move in a chaotic, believable way, and they are fairly menacing and ruthless. Rubbish monsters being the thing a lot of sci fi action gets wrong, in recent years.It's also pretty gory. So if that sort of thing floats your boat. You'll be happy enough. Its not Starship Troopers gory, but there are folks getting munched in half and alien eyeballs getting popped galore! So enjoy, weirdos!The plot however, is utter nonsense. Apparently future people are super dumb, and have never seen any time travel movie, ever!They travel back in time to essentially recruit meat for some future meat grinder, because all their own meat, got grindededed? (which right from the get go, doesn't seem to be going all that well. As we discover in the first few minutes of news montage).When in fact, these future folks, were actually in a great position to come back and turn the Earth of the past, into one giant fortress of alien death. Ambushing the yet-to-attack beasties!Use your future knowledge of the enemy, but in the past, so you can spend 30 years in R&D, developing anti alien weapons in readiness?...use the 30 years to build bunkers and train the entire population to shoot like Vasily Zaitsev??...Stock up on really big cans of RAID and giant mouse traps???NOPE!!!Let's instead send any 40+ year olds, (of which I am one, and can attest...bad idea!! I'm 41 and I already let out a groan when I sit or stand!). Lets send them, regardless of physical fitness/mental preparedness hurtling Into the future to die, VERY horribly in a losing war!Possible spoilers ahead, but not really.Not wanting to end up in spoiler town, but the actual final plan, which isn't as dumb as the old ""40+ meat grinder"" plan, (on the surface at least). STILL ends up being almost entirely pointless and forgotten when the chips are down.All these seemingly huge negatives aside. It's fun to watch. It's action sequences are good. It's effects nice. Characters are simple but fun. Aliens, setting, scenery, all hit the mark, and it has JK Simmons in it too! So what is not to like?Switch brain off, enjoy the comic relief, and unintentionally funny heroic banter. Oh, and (insert alcoholic beverage of choice here) helps too.",The Tomorrow War

Just like in quiet place, battle los angeles, or even cloverfield and to some extent edge of tommorow (although they are having some sf time jump aid) there is no logic in having relatively stupid naked aliens arrive on earth like locust swarm. No barenaked alien would stand a chance against modern armored military and modern weaponry on disposal. Unless they arrive in like 20 billion at once, they would be easily eradicated with even conventional weapons. Bunker buster bombs would deal pretty easily with any ""female queen hive"" or whatever. There wouldn't even be need for infantry. Even Phosphorous bombs from WW2 would do the job. And only US has so many tanks, that they would be pretty fine with this kind of enemy. No soldier would blink twice on ugly monster insect. In fact everyone would be pleased not to kill fellow human. The whole thing of killing each other in the wars is dehumanizing the other side to justify killing. If the enemy already look like this game monsters, well, it's bonanza for any military in the world. Real aliens that were capable to reach us, would most probably be so advanced, we would be utterly hopeless. They would, if they want us down, probably just release some ionizing radiation or heavy neutrino/black matter beam that would set us all off instantly.

The CGI is flawless. The monsters are terrifying (and yes I had nightmares about them last night). I think the theme could be interpreted as an allegory as well for what we see happening to our planet currently. And it is up the the current generation to solve this problem for our children. I digress.Action is top notch, I was certainly holding my breath many moments throughout the film. The story was interesting. I could see how the film is influenced by other films but it isn't in an overt or ""rip off"" way. The movie is also furthered by the relationships in Dan's life. I really enjoyed it. The creatures are absolutely terrifying. They are the scariest creatures I've ever seen in a film for sure. The story of their arrival was really intriguing to me as well. I would have loved to know more about that but there would be no real way for the characters to have that knowledge so it makes sense that the audience doesn't get to know either.

The whole film feels like a bad xbox storyboard, the script is basically irrelevant, the characters are completely hollow. I got the impression that any minute my teenage son would come in and take over the Dpad, and tell me to go and do something more appropriate for my age.Either that or this was produced by the most plastic human possible, whose only previous experience of scriptwriting was daytime soaps.The CGI is just about adequate on a ps2 level, but the cliche ridden dialogue makes you want to mute it every time a cardboard cutout mutters grunts.

Why would an advanced race use such a dangerously voracious predator to do their planet clearing when science would do a much cleaner job of it without leaving a dangerous mess to clean up.Equally improbable is the team that goes to end the story. First, they didn't carry enough explosives and second, a nuke would have been much more probable: Identify the target and call in a strike.

So I am here to help.Time-travel in this movie works more or less how time-travel should work in reality. Before time travel occurs, there is one time-line. However, once time-travel is initiated it creates two separate time-lines: the original future time-line and alternative time-line.Original time-line is the one where people lived in ignorance until aliens started attacking.Alternative time-line is the one where people out of nowhere teleported few decades before aliens attacked.This happening in one time-line have no influence for the things happening in the second time-line. That's why main character saving one time-line wouldn't automatically save another.The bridge between time-lines allows people to cross between them, but doesn't influence the course of events. Even if people in alternative time-line dies before having future children, those children in original time-line wouldn't disappear, because there is no causal link between time-lines.Of course not many people understand basic laws of quantum physicals and causality of time-lines, and because of that many incredibly dumb people (most like ""fact checkers"") keep raging about ""plot holes"".

Not everyone who acts is a bonafide leading man.Jamie Foxx, Chris Pratt, Chris Rock, Brad Pitt, The Rock, Vin Diesel. They are ensemble actors or good supporting actors. They may have one role that was noteworthy but other than that role, they cannot carry a movie alone to success.If an actor is close to on his way out or not as celebrated nor or as in the past then they executive produce.There are a few EP successes. Tom Cruise and the MI Franchise. But again no one is knocking down doors for him either. And I think know Vin Diesel producers the F&F franchise.

1260,veleskir,Felt like two different movies.,3,4 July 2021,"I have this vision of a writers room where the director and the screenplay writer are sitting down and hashing out the ideas for this movie only to get a call by some top level executive in Amazon telling them they won't get any funding if the movie isn't ""Hollywood-i-fied"". It's like two completely separate movies with two completely different parties vying for a seat at the table. I, of course have no idea if this is true, for all I know it could have been the exact opposite, but that's what it feels like. It doesn't feel like one solid movie with one specific idea in mind. It feels like a mash up of two different scripts that were put together because generic action movies with big names make bank.The first half of the movie is good; or at the very least, interesting. The movie starts off in a normal every day world following a normal every day guy only things start going wrong abruptly. Time Travel is revealed to the world, alien invaders and a dying world. The wife of the main character is a nurse or doctor who works with survivors of this future war in a group therapy capacity. All of which have PTSD on a level apparently beyond anything else imaginable. According to the military, only 1 in 5 survive said war. During one of the wifes sessions, one of these survivors comments on a clicking noise the aliens make(which by the way is never heard in the movie outside of one specific scene). At this point the premise is set. The future is horrifying and grim. The movie hasn't done anything that puts it above other Alien Horror movies, but it's at least somewhat unique and more interesting than another generic action that doesn't do anything new and doesn't have the fun, larger than life cast of those other action movies (Swarzenegger, Stallone, etc. Etc.).The main gets drafted and forced to fight in this war. No pictures of these monsters are shown or even allowed to be out for the general public to be seen. Why? They're that terrifying. They think that if people see them, they would rather take any and all consequences of running away from the draft.At this point, the movie is solid. It has set itself up as a horror with action elements. Even when they first get into the world, the screw up of their 'jump' and the creatures stalking them and watching them from a distance as well as the fact that you still can't make out exactly what they look like makes it a great scene all around.It's everything after this that is awful. It quickly drops any and all of this premise and starts taking the road of generic action war movie that takes the most laziest and boring route possible and because of this, killed any and all interest I had in the movie to begin with. If it had stayed as that terrifying action movie instead of just generic action, it would easily be up there as one of the better movies released this year.Instead it's easily one of the most disappointing.On a side note; you can tell how this is a movie from 2021 on a streaming platform. 95% of the cast is black. Not Latino or Asian or something else. Not reflective of modern American demographics. Nope. Just almost entirely black.",The Tomorrow War

Everything in this film is super-cringy, from acting to dialogues, everything.The story is very okayish and could be better.I think the director and writers are both students as they were not able to a certain tone in a movie, even the world- building is not done here.This movie is utter trash, can't believe it was going to go for a only theatrical release before pandemic.Also, jokes on Chris Pratt who was claiming this movie as 'The best movie ever made in the history of cinema, even way better than Citizen Kane' and also in a live-stream on Instagram he claimed that 'Movies like THE TOMORROW WAR comes once in 10-20 years'. Lol, he must have been high on something!",The Tomorrow War
1267,jiefengf,"For the Entertaining, Yes.",6,6 September 2021,"The totally stunning face of Chris Pratt who is forced into submission by soldiers and his bloody hot body are absolutely not the most memorable thing in the movie. It is for sure his great acting. No, seriously, the acting is very good. The CGI is realistic. I am huge fan of those well-made monster CGIs (not those high tech robots CGI). And the concept of the movie, especially with a quite novel beginning (at least to me), is a great plus.The plot holes are not ignorable unluckily. Two types of holes there are: irrelevant ones, like why researching toxins all these ways instead of using massive explosive weapons (because there are many ways to explain ""away"" these plot holes); relevant ones, like the completely non-sensical physics of time in the movie (this completely destroys the whole narrative of motivation of what the heroes are trying to do).If time traveling can alter the future, there is nothing to be really sad about a future daughter dying to be honest. She isn't even your daughter, you two are in a completely different parallel universe. I expected that Chris Pratt would somehow irresistibly step into the life that her future daughter has witnessed. And this would make the movie at least two levels higher than its current story. An almost 8-star movie.Pity no pity. It is still an enjoyable entertainment, and an entertaining thriller with its CGI.",The Tomorrow War

What most people keep missing about the plot is...SPOILER ALERT:Most people keep saying the plot is too confusing, too much plot holes, too much gunfire or why didn't they send back machinery. One; the plot isn't confusing, you just didn't pay attention. Two; there's absolutely no plot holes. It's simple, dude goes to the future after being drafted then helps his aged daughter discover a toxin that will destroy all the aliens that remain.

Nothing makes sense in the script, which had to be automatically generated by a computer of some kind, as i can not see a human mind come up with such a lame and unoriginal story, the casting was all wrong, the acting was at most decent, the action was not plausible or engaging. I dont even know where to begin pointing out what went wrong with this movie, because it was bad from the start till the end. Almost every scene seems to be missing something , and that something is common sense.Enough of the movie, because there is no movie, just a subliminal idea that hides behind the rolling images.

They were a lazy amalgamation of 100 monsters we've already seen. Even the monsters' snarls and grunts and squeals were from other movie monsters. Zero originality.The script was really bad. I don't understand why such hack writers continue to get their scripts made.Talky exposition. Info dumps. Scenes that tried to pull on heartstrings, but we're so poorly written that they only served to bog the movie down in melodramatic tripe that accomplished nothing.The characters talked and acted in ways that were totally unbelievable.

1283,robbenn69,"Negative Comments Aside, This Movie is a Blast",10,6 August 2021,"There are several mentions of the Vietnam War in this picture, which is fitting; because this is basically the Vietnam War done as a Sci-Fi film. I kept thinking of parallels to Platoon as I watched it. The forced drafts to go to a war that is pointless, the massive death counts, the demonstrations and riots. At one point the main character tries to flee after being drafted, like many did during the Vietnam War era; fleeing to Canada. The enemy they are fighting has many natural advantages, just as the North Vietnamese Army and Viet Cong did with their ability to conduct guerilla ops and to utilize the jungle, tunnels, and knowledge of territory to their advantage.The Vietnamese beat the crap out of the French, and so the US was brought in, when all that started to go badly, LBJ escalated the war with massive drafts. Basically the future people are France and the present people are the US. However, unlike Vietnam, the twist comes in the second half of the movie when the main character's daughter figures out a way to use biological warfare to win.Many of the reviews on here for this film speak of plot holes. Show me the film that doesn't have plot holes if you really want to look for them. Most films have some kind of plot hole, if you really think and pick apart the storyline. I admit, that I kept thinking, ""why didn't they just nuke the aliens?"" Or, ""since fire seems to kill them pretty well, why not use incendiary bombs and flame throwers?"" What it comes down to for me is: Was I entertained? Did what I see affect me emotionally? Did the film take me to someplace else?The answer to these three questions is an absolute YES. I was entertained, I was invested in the story emotionally, and I forgot real life for 2 hours as I was transported to the future. The acting by Chris Pratt is stellar. I had no idea he was that good of an actor. The supporting cast including JK Simmons, was equally up to the task and excellent. The CGI was amazing, very lifelike. It may not be a great film, but it's not ""Sharknado."" It is a good, entertaining, well made film. If you are not into Sci-Fi, then don't watch it. If you want a suspenseful, thrilling ride, then this movie is an excellent choice.",The Tomorrow War

But it has a few things going for it: it doesn't have superheroes, it's not part of a franchise or ""universe"", it's not a reboot or remake, and there's no blatant moral message shoehorned into the plot.The Tomorrow War is something has been sorely missing from (home) movie theaters since the rise of DC and Marvel: the summer blockbuster. An action flick that doesn't try too hard to be complicated or clever or serious. Sure, the plot doesn't always make sense, but this movie delivers where it counts. The action and SFX are great. There are no Oscar-winning performances, but Chris Pratt and the others carry the movie well, and appear to have fun with it. The pacing works.

1306,matt-87154,Starship Troopers + Aliens + Independence Day,7,4 July 2021,"I was excited for this when it was first announced...time travel and a war with aliens?!? Count me in!But when I saw the first trailer, I wasn't that excited for it. I just finished watching it and would give it a 7.5/10 or B+.As other reviewers have mentioned, this doesn't break new ground. It's more in the vein of Independence Day. Great cast, great action, great aliens but somewhat confusing (and sometimes laughable) logic.The action is reminiscent of Starship Troopers and Aliens but objectively as a whole, not as good as either of those films. The CGI and monsters/aliens are well designed though and it would have helped to have a bit more backstory on them. Acting was great but don't think to hard on the logical side of the plot as it won't make a lot of sense.This is essentially your summer blockbuster eco-to action film that is definitely worth a watch and recommended. But unlikely something you will watch over and over again in the future like the aforementioned Aliens and Starship Troopers.",The Tomorrow War
1307,Khaugh10,Solid new material to an already crowded genre,7,2 July 2021,"The Tomorrow War, a Sci-Fi movie with tough competition these days. Alien invasion sci-fi thrillers are very common in today's movie market, yet this movie still offers plenty of refreshing and unique aspects to the genre even with a slogging runtime.The first thing I have to compliment are the visual effects and CGI. Whoever came up with the idea to make the aliens white just did wonders for shooting in the daylight and I think it allowed the cinematography to thrive because it didn't have to adjust background lighting and compensate like they usually would for black or grey aliens. Being able to see the aliens in daylight up close in great detail was intense. The visual effects in general are amazing like their time jumping sequences when they turn into small particles looked incredibly soothing. I think the visual effects are where this movie shines the brightest.This movie was at its best when it was boasting its large team of popular supporting cast members. I love Chris Pratt but I found his acting to be stale most of the time, mainly when it was just him and another actor on screen trying to share emotional moments. However, he still has his charming moments throughout. The supporting cast was what I wanted more out of this movie. Everyone they introduced had great moments, but were eventually tossed to the side.The runtime is really my biggest complaint aside from some bland Chris Pratt. The plot isn't incredibly thick, but stimulating enough. The emotional moments really made it drag a little. I remember thinking the movie was about to be over, only to see that I was 1 hr and 30 mins in, with about 40 mins left, which felt dreadful, but the last act was actually pretty dope.Overall I have more good things to say about this than bad, which is always good when comparing projects in this overly saturated genre market. This alien movie really brought some new material to the genre.Quick random thoughts on actors: Yo who Tf told JK Simmons to get buff for this?? It was nice to see Seychell Gabriel back in the business since the ice princess in the last avatar. I was worried about Yvonne Strahovski, but she was solid. Sam Richardson was pretty funny, him and Chris Pratt meeting and having an instant bro moment was cute.",The Tomorrow War

He seems to be phoning it in a little bit. The other actors are relatively forgettable. The action is reasonable but marred by one movie cliche after another. It's so formulaic it's frustrating.

The failure in making an electrifying like the middle continued. At they could set some action which might cover the middle of the movie.

I am having a hard time seeing how any alien being would take multiple hits from a .50 cal rifle and not suffer any damage. Those things punch holes in armor. Why is it Holloywood just throws out military ranks like they throw out producing credits. Chris P says he was a 1st sgt in the SOF community, which means he had to have 15-20 years in service and he would be a retired vet.

I mean ooooof course last minute it all gets figured out. This is why movies just fail anymore. Series/shows can draw it out longer, make more sense of how things came to be. And naturally some young high schooler figures it all out to save the day.And what was with that weird neighborhood Pratt and fam lives in? Is that a typical looking neighborhood? It was odd. Whatever. Nothing to lose sleep over.The average adult who's favorite genre is sci-fi and that adult has watched enough sci-fi to pick and choose awesome over poor this can be categorized as poor.To the average child or non intellectual adult this could be received as oooh awesome cool special effects cause that's what gets them excited with overwhelming and exceedingly horrific blips of humans getting ravaged by a cgi dog like spider creature.I would suggest that any smart sci fi fan watch this with the assumption that you know there are going to be about 5 handfuls of unexplained plots that you can yourself piece together to make sense of it.It would just be nice if sci-fi flicks were written by sci-fi geeks.

It's no cinematic masterpiece but it was a great treat for the weekend.My only gripe was with the ending. There is a whole focus on finding a 'toxin' that can destroy the aliens creatures, but this didn't really have much of an impact in the end. A load of explosives did the job. This took away some of the emotional impact for me (I mean, his daughter sacrificed her life to find a cure and it was almost meaningless!) Also, the voiceover at the end seemed unnecessary.

It starts off great sci-fi but finishes as a joke. Remember a few years ago when some woman tried to touch up that painting of Jesus in a Spanish church and totally botched it up? This movie script is just like that where it was good and then someone else must've got a hold of it and ruined it.Now I'm not one of those people that complain that a sci-fi movie isn't following the usual rules of physics, and I will grant the sci-fi writer tremendous leeway for entertainment purposes, but there is a point where it gets so ridiculous that the movie is no longer enjoyable.Like most summer blockbuster action movies, there's some ridiculousness built in so you just turn your brain off and enjoy the ride.

Acting is good for everyone except for cringy Pratt in every scene he has to muster a tear. He gets drafted and sent with other civilians to fight unknown aliens with nothing but minutes of combat training. The world knows it will end in so many years but still does not find a better use for the the marine earth and atmospheric university prof (black sidekick comic relief) to kill himself in battle? Even more ludicrous, civilians with no training now have to go and rescue the military team. Big explosions, cool CGI, monsters that require several magazines to die and two heroic civilians who stay behind to kill the monsters dying in the big explosions that kill all monsters.Part II: Meet daughter 30 years later, father daughter drama over how Pratt repeated what his own dad did to his family. Mission is to extract the one and only female of the pack which somehow does not have the million males around her to protect her (deja vu from ""The Great Wall"" much? Especially with the way the aliens communicate with each other). With technology as advanced as time traveling and yet they send men in to their deaths as if robots are a thing of the past. Somehow Pratt saves the day, they escape in AGAIN big explosions that kill all the male aliens that decide to come at the last minute, leaving behind the whole military team to have a father daughter drama on the beach. The segment ends with the males coming for the female again and the logic of killing off the female goes above anybody's head even when they have an antidote. Pratt, who the whole humanity rest on his shoulders to bring back the antidote, tries to risk his own life to save the daughter in this future instead of going back to save her life 30 years from now. Oh and the whole of humanity as well. Big explosions, all die, Pratt is sent back to 30 years from where he came from.Part III: By now the movie thinks the audience's brain has liquified from all the explosions and sudden loud and dramatic soundtrack, the wife suggest that if they dont know where the aliens landed they must have been here all the time and not in 2048 like they suspected. GOOD that somebody thought of that! There is only ONE person in the world who could know about volcano ash and it is a high school kid! So here goes Pratt putting together a rogue team consisting of his estranged dad who is iron man, knows how to disassemble any kind of tech, how to fly jet planes in Russian territory without getting detected and of course doesnt trust the US government. They find the alien ship, inject a few toxins in some of the aliens but NOT the one and only female, discover there are millions of those aliens on the ship, decide to blow the whole thing up killing behind again two heroic disposable characters. Pratt escapes ONCE AGAIN from the explosion which kills ALL except for his daddy, his black sidekick and the female alien. Final scene, dad Simmons and son Pratt battle the alien with guns at first then literally in a fist fight while pratt had the toxin all along with him. Pratt kills alien in a superman fashion, saves his dad and as they both lay there, black sidekick lays down with them out of nowhere for that diversity picture. Grandfather reunited with the family, everyone is happy and no thought is given to all those expendable characters who died protecting Pratt. End scene 2 hr 18 min later.",The Tomorrow War

Neither movie is destined to be a best picture winner- but that's OK.The aliens are all you could have hoped for- terrifying, and well made. The plot is telling since it's called The Tomorrow War- it's a fight for survival of our species. The battles are fantastic and full of action, even threw in a few suspenseful scenes.Just see the movie for yourself.

1362,asgarhaider8,Decent action with plot loop holes,4,8 July 2021,I think there is a notion within the filmmakers that they have to make a decent enough action movie with a rocking trailer and thats what audience would love amidst worldwide pandemic situation. Tomorrow's War was nothing but a one time watch movie. Just another world extinction movie that had a different cast. Saw the casting of JK Simmons pretty pointless as an actor of his caliber should not have such a meek roles. Chris Pratt looked so out for this character. He pushed some comedic points but we all know it was not going to succeed. Not all characters are made for him. Many many plot holes in my point of view and i was literally questioning live when the scenes moved on.My four stars are for the effort of the CGI and purely nothing else.,The Tomorrow War

Like starship troopers, they give the ""soldiers"" small arms with 1000 rounds of ammunition against armored creatures. I know it looks good on film, soldiers firing wildly letting off thousands of rounds to no avail but you have to be dumb as a box of rocks not to say ""hey, why aren't they using M60 grenade launchers?

We've come an awfully long way since Chris Pratt was the goofy comic turn Andy Dwyer in TV's Parks and Recreation, pretending to be top-secret FBI agent Burt Macklin. These days he's got the chops to be a tough, chiselled action lead who removes his shirt to reveal some serious work with the personal trainer, and this is how he's presented in this great big overstuffed and overlong sci-fi action thriller from former animation director Chris McKay. In Guardians of the Galaxy and Jurassic World, Pratt had at least some residue of his former comedy existence, and to be fair there are one or two funny lines here (coming largely from JK Simmons, playing Pratt's grumpy yet adorable dad), but this is a very earnest and generic lead performance.",The Tomorrow War

That said, Yvonne Strahovski and Betty Gilpin deliver emotionally grounded performances while chugging through some pretty poor dialogue, which really is the test of an actor. Sam Richardson is funny. JK Simmons delivers a typical high quality performance. Edwin Hodges, Alexis Louder, and Jared Shaw create a badass team that you'd love to see in a better action movie. Mary Lynn Rajskub, Seychelle Gabriel, Jasmine Mathews, and Mike Mitchell are completely wasted. So much talent, but damn, it's just not good.

It's fine, though, as a simplistic plot device.Anyway, I give it a 7 for its fun, fast paced action, and interesting concept.

To my surprise - I got just that... but more and done right! :)Yes, objectively speaking this is a typical, by the numbers Hollywood blockbuster, but it actually had really solid drama, flow and was super entertaining, taking me back to the 90's, when Bayham was King and movies like Indipendence day and Armagedon were pumping adrenalin into our bodies.It was very well shot, the effects were great and the aliens never looked fake during the entire movie. It was surprisingly dark at moments and the characters had some really touching emotional moments. Yvonne Strahovski was particularly amazing in the film. Music was also pumping and epic all the way.Where The movie lost me a bit was, sadly, the ending. Without spoiling anything, it was a bit too bonkers, super hero-ish and underwhelming, compared to the rest of the film. But, this aside, I can very much recommend TTW, as it happened to be a solid and entertaining movie in the vein of old school 90 blockbuster Hollywood films and, from the more rescent years, it very much resembles the awesome Edge of Tomorrow.",The Tomorrow War

1421,lyf-7-804903,Surprising,7,8 July 2021,"As much as I had heard about how bad this movie was, I was genuinely surprised at how much I enjoyed it. Chris Pratt is typical, but it's really the supporting characters and actors who make this movie entertaining - JK Simmons is simply delightful, Yvonne S delivers the goods, Edwin Hodge and Sam Richardson are probably the ones who shine the brightest though.Biggest downside to me: about 30-40 minutes too long.",The Tomorrow War
1422,cheftoni55,Mehhh...kay,5,25 October 2021,"Pretty much most of, if not all, SciFi films require 2 things (obtusely): imagination & suspension of disbelief. Well, anyone watching this movie will need an extra helping of at least the 2nd requirement. Direction was alright, fair editing, solid CGI/FX--the aliens were fun & gory(ish)--like a cross btwn a giant tick, squid tentacles, Venus flytrap, & the hind legs of a panther, women & POC in lead positions, relatable characters, strong performances (considering the script/dialogue/premise), a bit of comic relief, action, & 2 dramatic connections. Obviously, budget impacted the finished release, there are ""plot holes"" (& frankly, some lazy choices: main characters not wearing helmets despite heavy combat scenarios & all other background folks wearing helmets, timeline, *riDICulous* character ""developments"", etc.--like...they couldn't give a female colonel a *decent* sports bra?? (eyeroll) sure, funny thing to point out, but painfully true) & no real exploration of characters' background (but that's expected.) Performances by Strahovsky, Richardson, J. K. Simmons--all very good. They threw away the talents of Betty Gilpin & a sedate Chris Pratt kinda just...faded it background. So, overall, a light & fluffy SciFi offering, but not an awful way to pass a couple of hours. (Bonus, for those concerned: no real profanity, no sex, only upper-male nudity, & no other major objectionable elements. May not be for kids under 7 yrs old, both for scary aliens, violence, & gun usage.)",The Tomorrow War

Christ Pratt and everyone in the movie did a great job knowing their characters and knew how to deliver. There is a message in there for you who know you're here for a reason so pay attention.The special effects are great, could have been better in some shots but those tiny mistakes are easy to ignore.The action is nonstop, good thing they add little breaks here and there so you can catch your breath. It is definitely an emotional rollercoaster.Grab your popcorn and a drink and let tour dinner child enjoy this flick.

The story is fresh and new and not a rehash of every other sci-fi flick that we have seen countless times before. I was glued to the screen for the 2 hours and 19 minutes running time and engaged in the storyline. Chris Pratt has shone again why he is one if today's great action stars!!!",The Tomorrow War

1433,Chriper7,The reviews are half the fun!,7,8 July 2021,"These reviews have given me a laugh - pointing out the things that either didn't make sense or were just stupid, and there were quite a few I hadn't thought of - so thank-you! Great way to finish the movie.Personally, the one that irritated me most was going to all the trouble of discovering the toxin in the future and getting it back to the past - when said toxin was only used to kill about 5 of them. Turns out all they needed was a block of C4.Oh, and consulting Chris Pratt's volcano aficionado high school student to find the exact location of the alien hive was a bit lame too.Overall though, I thought it was a pretty decent movie. Just don't analyse it too deeply and it's a fun way to spend 140 minutes.I thought I was going to be bored around the halfway point when they made the jump into the future. Don't tell me it's going to be an hour plus of chasing these creatures around and trying to avoid getting killed in the process. Fortunately it was not.The other reviewers who have pointed out the plot holes, the cliches, the lazy writing etc., all had good points, but for me it didn't take away from my enjoyment of the movie. Could have done with more of Chris Pratt's lame one-liners though lol.",The Tomorrow War

Tomorrow War!A film that's about a war in the future.. like 20-30 years in the future.. and not tomorrow.. but ""20-30 years in the future war"" wouldn't have been a good title..

Edge of tomorrow did this so much better its almost mind boggling. The script borders on cringe-worthy and suspension of disbelief completely goes out the window when they show up at the soccer stadium just proclaiming ""we come from the future, come fight for us"" and the next thing you see is a montage of the world mobilizing and feeding civlians into a meatgrinder of a war. Come on ... you're really trying to tell me that the world would just blindly believe that and people wouldnt immediately start rioting all over the place when theres such a thing as a ""global draft"".And it just goes downhill from there not the mention the entire movie literally gets resolved by a paradox(also something edge of tomorrow did way better).I wouldnt consider watching this if it werent included in my prime sub.",The Tomorrow War

However this isn't something that should be held against The Tomorrow War, it's fast paced, well acted and the effects look really good with some great moments of tension and terror as well as action.

Chris Pratt is the perfect lead character, very reminiscent of his role in Jurassic Park. The cgi was on point, the script is great, having those one liners and humorous moments we all love. The action sequences were exactly what you would expect from a $200 million budget, yet were not over the top or far fetched like some other recent action movies. (*cough* Fast and Furious *cough*)The basic plot is that a war breaks out in the near future where aliens wipe out most of the human population. People from present day are recruited to travel to the future to fight in this war. Chris Pratt leads a small team tasked with recovering a research team but things soon change when they realise what they are up against and the movie basically develops from there.I would highly recommend it unless you are any of the above individuals I mentioned.Definitely a well deserved 8/10 from me. :)",The Tomorrow War

So here we have yet another film with such a diverse range of characters that the creators opted to omit a cohesive plot. Civilians are drafted into the military and get no combat training.

This movie is everything that's wrong with movies today. A picture perfect example.And don't hit me with any ""take it for what it is"" crap! Because this movie tries to be a lot and it fails at every single try. It is trying to be a lot and it can't even deliver on being a decent sci-fi or monster film.I don't even know if it ""could have been better"" - maybe.... If it was a different film.

I'm supposed to buy that this preened bunch of uni students stood against this terrifying alien army somehow, and have come back in time to send all 40-somethings off to their doom in war. Hmm. Spoilt and hopeless young people quickly dispatching an unprepared older generation off to do their war for them so they don't have to. Seen this type of messaging before in new films.

Lots of action and screeching aliens if you are into that (and who isn't?). But too much of the plot, even for a popcorn movie, defies belief. Sure, I get that Chris and his merry band HAVE to be the only people on the planet to save the day. Glad that the core of the group made it, sad for the rest, they were some good folks.

1490,Teymur4,The last 40 mins saved the movie. (kind of),5,17 July 2021,"My review on The Tomorrow War. All together I wasn't really into the concept that much and some story lines I wasn't too keen on or interested in. The comedic aspect of the movie didn't fit the tone of the movie and was there only for some parts of the movie when certain characters were there, I feel like the should have just removed the comedic parts of the movie. The plot and writing are pretty good, it's not like anything mind blowing or amazing but it's good. The characters aren't bad but some I didn't like that much. A few things didn't really make sense and I think some stuff could have been done differently. But the last like 40 mins of the movie I really enjoyed and I was interested in, It was probably the best part of the movie. I wish they adapted that tone and feel to the beginning of the movie because at the begin I wasn't really interested or compelled, but then at the last 40 mins of the movie I was interested and compelled. The last 40 mins kind of saved the movie. If it wasn't for the last 40 mins it would probably be like a 4/10. Overall I rated this movie a: 5.5/10.",The Tomorrow War

If you like action, it's great, as the CGI effects were very good. The basic plot of the movie was interesting, but as noted above, could have been done a LOT better. Then again, this was directed by Chris McKay... who's best accomplishment was ""LEGO Batman"", so I honestly shouldn't be surprised.",The Tomorrow War
1493,LoveStallion,Perfectly Passable,6,3 July 2021,"I'll echo what others have said. This is just a good popcorn flick. It's not particularly smart. It's not groundbreaking. But it has an interesting premise and some fun set pieces, even if it's not that suspenseful, and most of twists and turns are either telegraphed from a mile away, or have just become the norm for films like this.A word of caution on slamming Amazon over this flick if you didn't like it. Amazon had nothing to do with the production of this film. Paramount and Skydance made it. It was supposed to be released theatrically, but Paramount got cold feet because of COVID. Amazon swept in and picked up the distribution rights. That's it. The ""Amazon Original"" is only labeled as such because Amazon bought the rights to a finished product. Harp on Amazon if you don't like the way the film was marketed, but not if you think the producers should have made different choices. That's for Paramount.""The Tomorrow War"" is certainly not for kids. It's kinda funny how if we have copious amounts of gore involving humans, a film is easily Rated R, but if the surprisingly extensive gore involves alien critters, then whatevs. It's PG-13. Either way, I'd keep this to the 15+ set. (It has a 16 rating in many other Western countries, although it carries a mere 12 in the UK.)Overall, I was still more entertained than I expected. Some of the dialogue is pretty pathetic, and plenty of jokes don't really land. But overall, even if the flick is overlong, it moves at a pretty brisk pace, with four main action sequences.However, I agree with other reviews that take issue with some of the great realizations that set the stage for the third act. I am not knocking Dan's wife for thinking perhaps the alien spacecraft didn't land at the date everyone assumed, but surely the best minds in government and research had already considered this possibility, right? Maybe it's a subtle dig at government being bloated and ineffective (there's that comment about the UN talking things over for years), but there's no way on earth the U. S. military and others would not have explored every possibility and permutation.And then there's volcano kid. Because the only volcanologist worth his salt is the kid from your class. There are no other experts!Lastly, I suppose there's some sort of message? Like we're supposed to understand how underappreciated Dan feels, and be happy in the end when he has a ""everything I need is right here at home"" moment? I'm sorry, but at the very least to honor those who died going rogue in Russia, that story would be public, not Dan retreating to some quiet life having learned a valuable lesson about the importance of family. You won't really feel anything for the characters in this film.Anyway, it was still a fun watch. I have no regrets.",The Tomorrow War

The future they had is not what they want to live in, as the merely surviving population.Though so, the last portion of the movie is the least believable one, as I find it doesn't make sense that, after uniting to fight the tomorrow war, they are at loggerheads when it comes to eradicating the dormant aliens.I do think the movie has potential for sequel as the present is changed due to the interference from the future and now they have access to the time travel technology.

1506,marosbts,And you thought Green Lantern was bad,2,3 July 2021,"The issue with time travel movies is, that sooner than later, you end up in a time paradox. One which would have horrible consequences. Especially, when you travel to the past. Any action, could influence the future and create a paradox.That is the primary reason, why the premise of this film makes little to no sense.30 years from now, apparently Aliens are taking over the world and humanity has lost the war. Now, in order to fix it and not create a paradox, they do not want humanity to prepare for the war, but they only want to send recruits to fight in the war. These are sent with little to no training and preparation which leads to their high mortality rate.Now, you would think that if you have a time machine, you could draft them at a time point in which you have fully trained and better equipped soldiers, but those guys in the future or the writers did not really iron that part out.The aliens are obviously almost invincible, with only a few vulnerabilities on their neck. Go figure. They run fast, swim, fly/glide but they are fairly well killed by bombs. OH, did I mention that F-22´s are still operational in the year 2050? Who would have thought that!But back to Chris Pratt. So despite being vetted and cleared to fight in the future, he is assigned to a mission in which he immediately meets his now adult daughter, who is a super specialist trying to figure out how to kill those aliens with a toxin. While she should be guarded as a national treasure, she goes herself on a suicide mission to retrieve an alien queen which holds the key to her research. They manage to extract the queen in a cage (anyone figured out how they got that cage down there through the tiny hole?) and as their helos get destroyed by the hordes of the aliens they manage to escape in a Humvee.Back at their base she is quick in discovering the toxin, but the male aliens come to rescue the queen in hordes and obviously there is no stopping them. Pratt is about to jump back in time with the toxin to get it manufactured in masses to win the war.Now, this kind of kicks off the time paradox, but nobody believes him so we are still safe. But honestly, you ever seen a soldier return from the battlefield, holding vital information, the weapon against the future doomsday and nobody cares. When he comes with information about a possible location, to which he is guided by a teenage kid/hobby volcanologist, nobody from the government wants to investigate.So he does the only thing which you can do in this kind of situation- you go ask dad for help. He and a couple of friends fly to Russia (undetected) poorly equipped immediately discover the location of the alien space ship. To get in, they cause an explosion the US Army would take weeks to prepare. While this would collapse any ice caverns beneath, they still get to a space ship. Without properly scouting the ship, they kill a few of the aliens, which only causes the others to wake up. So they decide to blow up the ship (again, without proper preparation), but realize that one queen got out. So the father-son duo go hunting the queen, which is pissed cause they killed all the other aliens. Ultimately, in a rather hilarious and hardly believable battle they kill her and prevent the war from happening.We arrived at the time paradox. Without a war, they would never have the toxin. But nobody gives a damn, we are all safe now.It would be at this stage where most of us would like the time paradox just created to completely destroy the movie and return the time we spent watching this trash. It is just a ripoff of so many movies and has been filmed in so many other movies. This one brings absolutely nothing new. Acting is horrible at times, characters are poorly developed, events are totally predictable.

1521,lamieur,Will test your suspense of disbelief,3,20 July 2021,"The movie starts with someone dropping from the sky into a pool. Then we learn this is the main protagonist and how he got there. And it isn't what you'd think.I won't go into spoilers, but even this first scene tells what will come. The hero survives countless situations which no one else would, even in the movie's ""universe"".The movie tells us 20% (one time it's said to be 30%) of the people survive a single encounter. The movie tells us a couple of aliens can wipe out entire human race, including combined military forces of all the nations. But you will see random people killing the monsters with their bare hands. 2048-2051 combined world science can't figure out where the aliens came from, but a housewife in 2022 figures it out in 10 seconds. Somehow there's a time machine in the future, but they can't send plans to the past to build more. They can send people with clothes and guns into the future, but can't send tanks or bombers. One guy collects a clip from a dead soldier to say a dramatic line, but all guns (taken from 2022) have infinite ammo anyways. There's an example of this stupidity every minute of the movie, but I won't go into details to avoid actual plot spoilers.And then there's the melodrama. Between the CGI action scenes, there will be scenes with violin music engineered to boil emotions in your heart. Because an action movie needs cheap tear jerks. You just know it's an American block-buster designed by a committee.And then there's the filler. The movie is over two hours long and there are long moments where you just fast forward because nothing happens. People stare at mountains for a minute, stuff like that. I guess in 2021 we're supposed to marvel at CGI? No idea, FF button it is.Of course the melodrama and boring filler could be fixed in a different cut, but that wouldn't save the movie. The depth of stupidity in the plot makes this impossible to save.

1536,sunny_wells,Great action movie!,10,6 July 2021,"If you're looking for a good movie with some comedy, a lot of action, all the feels and of course, Starlord.. look no further! This was a great movie!! The aliens are INSANE and the ending was perfect! Exactly what we've been missing from Hollywood! Loved the one liners from everyone! I could watch it again! And of course my favorite actress from ""The Hunt "" Betty Gilpin paired up perfectly with Chris Pratt!!",The Tomorrow War
1537,nazrulislam-43783,Good action but story doesn't flow,6,5 July 2021,"This film gave me mixed feelings and nothing seemed to flow too well. The film was long but many of the scenes felt rushed. The story and script was not on par with the action. The special effects were good though. Would've liked to see some character development and tension. There were a couple of emotional scenes but there were also a few unfunny scenes. Acting was OK from all. The film has many simarities to Tom Cruises Edge of Tomorrow which is one of my favourite films of all time, but this film falls flat in comparison. Overall, worth a watch.",The Tomorrow War
1538,melissamckoy,"Welcome to plot-hole central, where absolutely nothing makes sense",1,11 July 2021,"My guess is that Chris Pratt wanted to star in an action movie where he gets to play a character both macho and smart (combat veteran and scientist rolled into one). Well, you got one of those things, Mr. Pratt, because, in my opinion, this movie is populated by the stupidest, most unreasoning, most illogical characters I have ever seen gathered in one film. If the filmmakers had made every character a chimpanzee with actor voiceovers, at least the movie would have been funnier, even if it still didn't make any sense.I must admit, I skipped parts of this movie because it was so incredibly stupid, so I don't know if the future war is supposed to be happening on a different timeline. If, however, it is supposed to be on the same timeline, then the ending creates a massive paradox: that is, you cannot use information you got from a future that never happens to defeat an enemy in your time. If you change the future so that some future war never happens, no one would travel backwards in time to tell you of the danger, because for them, it would never have appeared.Videos on YouTube have covered this major plot hole, but I'll mention it here anyway: wouldn't it be smarter for the ""future"" people to tell the people of their ""past"" everything they know so that their parents and grandparents could wipe out the threat before it became so serious? Obviously there are some brilliant people in this future: send them back so that they can provide future tech, tell you the vulnerabilities of your enemy and help engineer weapons that would take them out easily! Or how about this? The human race is about to be wiped out, yes? So send all of the survivors back to the past and the enemy is left to starve or eat itself! I mean, you could fit 150,000 more people somewhere on the planet where they wouldn't meet their past selves, couldn't you?Going back to the timeline thing, Dan not wanting to leave his daughter to die in the future was the stupidest thing. If you defeat this enemy in the past, your daughter will never have to face this nightmare in the first place, you idiot!Seriously, this movie is dumb. I like a loud, dumb, flashy popcorn flick every now and again, but this is downright insulting to anyone who has half a brain and can use it. Next time, Mr. Pratt, try playing a scientist who is actually halfway intelligent. I know it's acting, but (facepalm). And stay away from time travel!",The Tomorrow War
1539,Maxio,Finally a good action flick,9,8 July 2021,"This is actually the movie Independence Day should've been. It was believable and they dpend a lot of time on charachter building. Yes, there are cliches which are needed in a high concept movie, but most are believable. The wife finding the solution is logical because of the info she got from the future. So, the time travel had a good purpose. Could be explained as a coincidence, but with simple deduction I could've come up with the same conclusion.The CGI was finally at the right level. If you ever see Loki, then you know what's a wrong use of CGI. Far better then any Michael Bay product (with the exception of The Rock). And Chris Pratt - which isn't my favorite - was really at his place here. Finally a good action movie and yes, it did remind me of the classics from the 80s and 90s. I see it as a good thing.",The Tomorrow War
1540,apollosyndrome,Nothing original to see here... Just a revamped Mish mash,4,4 July 2021,"I sooooo wanted something fresh and new that none of us had ever thought of before, but nah, nothing about this film is original.

Anyway it was ok but nothing special.",The Tomorrow War
1541,jeremywtfbbqsauce,A bloated incoherent and inconsistent mess.,2,2 July 2021,"This was one of the poorest attempts at a time travel story I think I've ever seen. The writers try to hand wave away questions the audience has in one very short rapid fire scene of absolutely nonsensical explanations and exposition that puts all suspension of disbelief to a screeching halt.The script is a constant assault on the viewers intelligence. They truly believe we cannot make connections without things being painfully spelled out for us. And the plot holes big enough to drive a semi through, I guess they thought would just fly under the radar?Chris Pratt's acting is ok here. He plays the same trope laden hero he always does. They shoe horned in a beyond stereotypical black comedic relief. A trope that should have been left behind in the freaking 90s. Everyone else is completely boring or given minimal screen time to not take a second off Chris (which, this is probable a good time to say he's the executive producer of this film).Action scenes with a 1000 jump cuts. They're annoying and I don't know anyone who actually likes watching scenes composed this way.And lastly for me: the runtime. Nearly 2 and a half hours long. There is so much filler crap that could have, and should have, been cut from this. The pacing and random high tension music out of nowhere from scene to scene is jarring and uneven.In conclusion: Brain dead action flick that thinks it's viewers are stupid with a terribly under-cooked premise.",The Tomorrow War
1542,sornum,Plot holes & Inconsistencies galore,4,9 July 2021,At least in Austin Powers they told us not to worry too much about the time travel inconsistencies and just enjoy the show.Charlie (Sam Richardson) made this movie watchable for me. That's about it.,The Tomorrow War

1546,andremanuelalves,Entertainment is assured,8,4 July 2021,"First of all, I really hope that the actors will consider the public's opinion more than the critics' opinion.This is a very interesting movie and with an above average cast.The beginning leaves us glued to the chair and the story unfolds very well. The aliens are pretty creepy and original and the CGI is great. The cast's performance is a point to highlight as well as the fight scenes. The film always leaves an atmosphere of tension until the final outcome.One of the negative points is the lack of explanation for time travel, there are things that should not be possible considering that the main character traveled to the future and when returning to the present, he changed it, thus also changing everything that was passed in the future tense (2052) of the film. But of course time travel is always difficult to explain. Apart from that, it's a good movie, I don't get the criticism from the ""professional critics"".",The Tomorrow War

Just Meh",5,2 July 2021,"SPOILERS!!!There were too many holes in the story line for me to get into, but anyone with half a brain will come to the same conclusions I did by the end. Not the worst film ever produced but could and should have went in a different direction.One big point of contention is:
The world has a mandatory draft to stop the aliens and the military spares no expense to try and eradicate them (even gives families $1 million if their family member (draftee) does not return from the future, but by the time Chris Pratt returns from the future (7 days later) NATO is disbanded and the military refuses to send a team to prevent the attack from ever occurring because they don't want to spend the money... So 6 civilians have to take matters into their own hands to try and save the world almost starting this alien war years before it supposedly occurred.He was broken up about his daughter dying in the future but when he returned to the present he had the toxin to defeat the aliens which would have prevented his daughter from being in that position.Again, it's good to kill some time and relax for a couple hours with some adult beverages, but I would be VERY UPSET if I had spent money to see this.",The Tomorrow War

Most of all the portrayal of how the military and government would operate under these circumstances is laughable. SPOILER: THE DRAFT... was beyond ridiculous, every military organization has to have COMBAT TRAINING. Regardless of the urgency you can't just grab civilians off the street, put a gun in their hand, immediately deploy them and expect a favorable outcome. That right there makes you loose all respect for the story. (Transformers Dark Of The Moon / that is an example of how you properly integrate the military into a Sci-Fi story).

I still watched because it looks great and there is lots of amazing craft to the production but as a film it's about as cliched as it gets .

It's a classic Disaster film and feels like it could have been made in the 90's. It's got that Starship troopers nostalgia combined with Stargate and the thing I like most about it is it brings it home with warming family drama. I couldn't tell you what movie the plotline resembles as it might ruin the film for you.

And the other about a father who is just trying to save his daughter's life and her future. Chris Pratt (dad) and Yvonne Strahovski (daughter) are fantastic in their roles.There's action, impressive CGI, and terrifying aliens who may or may not be an allegory to some impending world/climate disaster. It's essentially Edge of Tomorrow 2.0, and I'm okay with that. 8/10, watch it now!Note: the usual suspects are not happy with The Tomorrow War because they don't like Chris Pratt and/or they can't ""politically identify"" with the movie.

1585,sweetseve-36066,Concept too Hard to Swallow,3,5 July 2021,"I really had a hard time with the movie. It went so far against any logical idea of how something of this nature would play out. This isn't a science fiction movie... I think it's closer to science fantasy because it requires an intelligent audience to swallow way too much.1. Considering how important having bodies for the war was the future put no effort in preserving their numbers, and didn't make any choices based on the need for ANYONE to survive.2. Their weapons seemed so useless they could have benefited more from weapons or war tactics than untrained civilians.3. The one of the largest explosion in the movie is used on ice and not to kill anything. They even raid the hive to capture one but don't bother planting any explosions to damage and he hive.(fun fact, a naval ship, a drone, or a submarine could have launched an attack on the hive without being anywhere near it right now is 2021). Despite what the scientist discovered I'd bet the best way to kill a queen would have been to blow the hives up, but no one suggests that.4. When the scientist returns to his time with a weapon that can kill all the alien bugs literally no one cares.5. A world that cooperates to send most of humanity to their death cannot cooperate to send a team of people to the present that may solve the problem because it could cause an international incident.6. Wouldn't it have made more sense for the future people to travel to the past to fight the alien bugs before they were a problem? I mean imagine if they all traveled on the Sabbath to 2022( I think it was 2022 in the movie, I don't remember) and stayed looking and researching until they found the aliens... Wouldn't that have been a better idea?? I mean the Terminators are a bit more clever in their problem solving skills.In the end it's just too much to swallow. This futuristic war takes war entirely back in time to a time where all war is fought with under-armed unprepared ground troops. All this out of a future that managed time travel. No one uses straight ground troops anymore. War is fought by air strikes, then ground troops and drone strikes are becoming more and more common. For this concept to work at the very least the war part would need to make sense. After all the name of the movie is The Tomorrow War. Even if you just accept everything they're serving to you just to try to enjoy it for what it is, there are some odd decisions. The whole interaction where the daughter is mad at her father because he in the future would leave her mother seemed like a very strange waste of time. I would think most real people if they were in that situation would understand they could keep that from ever happening. Her whole speech is given in a way as if it couldn't be undone. And she was more upset over the divorce than his death, and she didn't seem excited to see him alive again if only for seven days. How weird is that? .... The actors weren't bad... The movie was.",The Tomorrow War

The acting was okay with some good comedy mixed with some cringe worthy one liners. CGI was very well done. The characters were ok. The father daughter character were good but all others were one dimensional. So all in all very ok movieThe two halves plot is the only retractor for me.

1599,vecna-81087,Not Bad,7,4 July 2021,"As a lot of people have already posted ""not a bad popcorn flick""As always though I will concentrate this review on plot holes.First , it is a time travel flick, and as we all know time travel is a paradox by definition, films do their best to manage this basic time paradox but none have ever really come close. This is not unexpected since physicists are still struggling with the concept.1) If news of a future war gets displaced 30 years backwards in time, that is goung to cange the face of humanity and the planet big time, lots of people who would have been born, might not be born, where do they go ? When do they cease to exist ? What if one of them was key in the development of time travel tech ? Personally I would expect the 30 years to be the most productive in human history, the entire human population would be an armed camp, imagine the entire global GDP spent on arms and research for 30 years. I think your talking a tank per person at that rate.2) They are dumb monsters, not tech savy, so would never have been a problem. Nets, Razer wire, barbed wire, snare traps, land mines, ......... etc3) A standard AR round bounces of their armor, but a 50 cal tears them to pieces. Solution HV or steel armor piercing rounds for your AR. Save some soldier's that way, and at 1mil bucks per body bag ( to next of kin ) you want to keep them alive. Even better take a tank with you.4) Why the hell put your most valuable asset in middle of ocean? What happened to all the nuclear bunkers? Hollowed out mountains that can withstand 100mega tonnes without blinking, enough food water and air for years, USA/USSR is full of em5) If all males attracted to female, fly captured female to a bunker somewhere, wait till 50km of them are packed 4 high, then nuke the enire area. Then do it again and again.6) Female all chained, but no one covering her with a 50cal ? When it hits fan only way of killing her is by toxin ? Nope 50 cal will do just fine.7) When he gets back to present day. What was the toxin about ? Basically toxin never got used ( appart from annoy a ship full of killier aliens, by melting a few ) good old c4 did the trick.8) Toxin works great on males, one can clear entire nests but humans still losing ? Methinks a Trump relative was global ruler at the time.9) Where the hell did the black guy at the end come from? Chris and father set off on bikes after the last female, black dude is KM's away but finds them on a glacier, in a storm, with no comms. Just in time to have a lie down.",The Tomorrow War

The aliens aren't hidden, they are front and center and shown being freaky from the start.Acting: Also great. Chris Pratt is stellar, as well as the core cast.Writing: Dialogue was fine, but begins to decline as the film goes on. Plot also stumbles toward the end (see below).SPOILER SECTION:1. The fact that no government would be willing to prematurely eradicate the alien threat with the cure sent back from the Future is...dumb. If all of the world instituted a draft and organized the infrastructure we saw at the beginning of the film, then I'm sure they would all be more than willing to what was needed to keep the war from needing.2. Yes we can get hung up on time travel things, but honestly this wasn't a huge issue for me.3. The final fight... getting past the government not being willing to help, the fight shouldn't have really had to happen. They were dumb and didn't start with executing the primary goal/purpose of the toxin, KILL THE QUEEN!!! If they had started with the Queen and been smart about using the toxin then this would have gone differently.

For me, the action scenes themselves are underwhelming. I can't think back to any one scene that I thought was really well done and visually interesting. There's just no cool factor.I think one of the problems is that the protagonists fire thousands of bullets and they have no effect. It deadens the effect of the fight. Why not just run away, which they do anyway. There are so many ways to make these action scenes more interesting to the viewer, but the director seems to not have any creativity in setting them up.As an example, later in the movie when the base gets overwhelmed, the aliens just appear and take over. Why not set this up just a bit more slowly to create fear and dread, more excitement. It was rushed and loses its effect.Anyway, this movie feels overly long at 2 hours and 20 minutes. I was waiting for it just to be done already and frankly have not watched the last 30 minutes yet. I was bored last night and will watch the rest tonight.If you really want your sci-fi fix, then by all means watch it. However, if you want a similar movie, just watch Edge of Tomorrow.

1632,amdarmy,It's made of plot holes,2,13 July 2021,"The basic premise is a plot hole, as outlined in the trailer. If you have time travel tech, you change the past to alter the future. Future tech or knowledge or actions using that future knowledge to alter the past is the power and advantage of time travel. They don't do that kind of thing. They're instead using time travel to recruit handfuls of untrained past citizens (in an alternate timeline, since otherwise killing them would cause paradoxes to the point of ripping the universe to shreds, who have no loyalty or direct connection to the future they come from) to die like flies without a stated goal or purpose.I went in on the power of Chris Pratt and JK's acting chops, assuming a twist. Because they're obviously not who they say they are, and they're obviously not doing what they say they're doing. It's a mystery. It's transparent. What's their actual motive? What are they actually doing with these people? Where are they actually from? Is this an alien plot?Turns out, none of that. The thing that doesn't make any rational sense and obviously isn't what's happening is what's happening. And the movie just goes on like that. Things happen. They don't really make sense. There are a few interesting ideas but they're not connected by any sort of coherent plot.It feels like a rushed first draft that no one bothered to read. And that makes it kind of boring when they drag things out. And oh, they drag things out endlessly. They don't bother inserting anything that'd make the movie work, they just elongate fight scenes that you don't care about and aren't done very well, or emotional scenes where, since the plot doesn't make sense, the character's lives don't matter. The movie as is could be an hour shorter and better for it. Or better yet, never made.That said, it could have been made serviceable with a couple hours of editing the screenplay. The future requests elite soldiers from the alternate past to capture a queen, key researchers to develop a bioweapon, and in return for it the alternate past gets the bioweapon before the aliens ever arrive as payment. Works fine. Pratt's acting was good, the CGI was decent enough, with a decent plot it could have been a real movie.",The Tomorrow War

1645,jantoniou-205-555937,Starts great; ends poorly,7,10 July 2021,"""The Tomorrow War"" is certainly entertaining enough and the premise is interesting: the earth 30 years in the future is being overrun by a truly voracious and nasty alien species that are affectionately nicknamed ""whitespikes"" (for their weapon of choice which they shoot out from tentacles). The dwindling numbers of humans remaining in a desperate bid to save the planet and themselves figure out how to time travel using a fragile time travel portal - time link or jump - to return to the past and bring past humans into the future. They use this portal to bring people from the past 30 years into the future both to fight the whitespikes but also to put fresh eyes on what is a dire and truly desperate situation and focus scientific research on how better to kill the alien critters that have effectively overrun the planet.This basic premise holds up pretty well during roughly the first two acts of ""The Tomorrow War"" but once Chris Pratt's character Dan Forester returns to the past - all combatants who are conscripted into service are automatically ""jumped"" back in time after 7 days in the highly unlikely event they survive - the movie begins to fall apart quickly with Mack Truck-wide plot holes that quickly begin to feel pretty ridiculous.One of the more obvious examples is after returning Pratt has the brilliant insight to really think about, uh, gee where'd these crazy alien beasts suddenly show up from when there was no apparent landing of an alien ship on earth when the attacks started. Though this had occurred to both current and future humans Chris and his ragtag team of misfits figure it out in like 5 minutes, are able to fly a big C130-type airplane into Russian airspace (SPOILER it turns out the aliens were indeed hiding deep under the frozen Russian tundra probably for 1000s of years), and within a few hours miraculously discover the hidden under a thousand feet of ice crash landed alien ship with a bunch of hibernating whitespikes in the cargo hold.The entire setup of the third act feels incredibly rushed and silly. I mean come on all of the planet's CURRENT pack of genius scientists and engineers couldn't have endeavored to figure out where the future's alien nasties came from? They had to come from SOMEWHERE right? If they didn't in fact land an alien ship on the planet to begin the attack - which it's clear they didn't- none of our geniuses strives to figure exactly when, how, and where these aliens appeared on the planet. Instead it falls on the shoulders of a super nerdy high school kid who really loves vulcanology to determine that the whitespikes have ancient volcanic ash on it, indicating the approximate (vast) region where a massive volcanic explosion happened in the distant past.Also it's unclear why they couldn't have simply nuked the female whitespikes- which are relatively few in number and fiercely protected by the males. They wouldn't really have needed even to nuke them but just dump a bunker buster type bomb on their nests and bam you knock off a big chunk of their reproductive capacity. I suppose the theory is they tried that or in the future on a planet rapidly overrun with voracious aliens who essentially eat their way through the indigenous population they rapidly run out of high speed industrial capacity to make tens or hundreds of thousands of such bombs. So I'll give that plot hole a pass.It's also somewhat unclear what the whitespikes would do once they successfully overrun the planet. The implication from the crash landed alien craft discovered in the third act is that it's actually some other alien race that drops the whitespikes off on some poor unfortunate planet to depopulate it then I assume strip it of its natural resources. One can only assume this other alien race (that we learn nothing about) must be well aware of how to kill off the whitespikes once they've served their purpose as how would these other aliens be able to strip the planet with billions of these whitespikes running around?Or maybe they're just sadistic nutjobs who enjoy terrorizing planets and don't really care how it's done and who does it. They don't dig deep trying to figure that one out but then I suppose it's not that important as the understandable immediate urgent priority of the movie is to perpetuate the survival of the species rather than extrapolate what motivated some freaky alien race to attempt to come and consume the earth.In any case if you can tolerate the rather flimsy third act ""The Tomorrow War"" really is rather entertaining as a pure actioner. I just wish they had worked a lot harder on that final act to make it more believable.",The Tomorrow War
1646,asby1156,A Drone-Less Movie Saved By Chris Pratt,3,8 July 2021,"Time-travel technology developed in 30 years, but no highly-advanced killer drones? Thirty-years of almost certain advancements in aerial drone and ground robot technology by the militaries around the world, and none of this appears in 2051? Simply herd the alien monsters by using animals as bait, then the drones slaughter them from the air? Or feed all info about one of the dead or captured alien monsters into the highly-advanced drones' computerized brains, then they would perhaps know how to track and terminate them? But I guess the writers thought they wouldn't have a movie if they included these sorts of highly-probable things, so rather than step back and try harder to make the monsters more intelligent and complex, and thus more difficult to kill, they just plowed ahead with total nonsense. But, of course, they knew they had Chris Pratt, and his huge, loyal fan base, so why transcend lazy writing?",The Tomorrow War

They end up doing this anyway towards the end of the movie so why didn't anyone think of doing this first????Totally illogical story writing.Also, do you really think a scientist would be willing to blow up an alien spacecraft instead of harvesting all the tech from it? Nah of course not.Come on guys how about spending a little bit more time on story writing and little bit less money on special effects...

Time travel meets aliens meets global warming = it's a pretty unusual combo. Critics need to give atleast that to the makers.Chris Pratt's acting is great as usual, story is intriguing, exciting, many finger biting scenes, and (almost) flawless plot..*Spoilers ahead*
Super innovative global melting side effect..
What could have been better is the alien profiling. Yeah my skin crawled during the last scene, esp when Chris yells at it, ""dieeeee...."" but if they were a little more eerie than eww, it would have added to the drama :)
Flaws:
In the glacier, Chris Pratt says, ""we don't have time"" .. but they do have good 30 years to terminate the future war. They werent supported by the govt but there was this gamut of future people who would have trusted them and could have helped with the glacier operation, they didnt have to do it such a small team. In fact I would have put all those future people on front line Amanda let them be killed coz just like Muri they'll also have a different future if the war didnt happen in the first place.Overall it makes it to my top 5 alien movies of all time!",The Tomorrow War

Oh, hang on!I can forget logic and enjoy a movie for its good parts, but there are limits! This made no sense and had a horrible, clumsy set of 'moral' messages throughout.

The time travel concept was decent, and the vulnerability of the science was enlightening to see. The storyline itself was great all around, although...The only issue with this movie is they default to a cheesy 90's type way of solving the problem at the end...like watching a cable tv tech figure out how to stop alien invaders, and with the help of a Marine pilot, that can somehow fly alien spaceships, save the world together.

BUT *spoilers ahead* I had so many issues with the basic logic in the plot. Once future Muri dies, basically nothing made any sense to me. Chris Pratt bringing the toxin back in time would erase future Muri's timeline regardless of what he did with the toxin so he was never going to be able to go back there. I had assumed the whole time that their plan was to bring the toxin back in time and then just kill the aliens with it when they showed up in Chris's timeline and then just solve the problem for humanity as a whole because of course Muri's timeline will never be saved because that's not how the writers decided time travel works. But of course, then Chris Pratt just kept telling us how he's going to go back to future muri and save those 500,000 people instead of the other 8 billion, or about how ""he's running out of time"" to stop the frozen aliens who we very well know aren't going to wake up for another 30 years, and god damn him just running in to their space ship blindly and trying to take them on with their small ragtag crew instead of spending some portion of their next 30 safe years planning how to deal with the aliens safely just was like wait what!! Stop! Bring more people at the very least! Everyone in the world was convinced that ""people from the future came back and need help fighting aliens"" but they're not going to believe that you found those aliens in a glacier???????????????

Unfortunately, The Tomorrow War is no exception.Whilst there are a bunch of epic action sequences in this film, the entire movie was ruined by the fact that i spent the majority of the film questioning the massive plot hole.Chris Pratt is told by his grown up daughter that after his jump to the future, he split up with his wife when he came back, and then later died in a car crash. But hearing this supposedly changes Chris so that when he goes back in time he changes that timeline. And that's where we get the humongous plot hole.This wasn't the second or third time Chris Pratt jumped into the future, it was his FIRST time. Therefore, EVERYTHING that happened during that jump would be EXACTLY THE SAME as the jump after which he divorced his wife.It just makes no sense. And this is why i hate time travel films. Because Directors always let slip at least one massive plot hole.Oh yes, and the film also has one of the most stupid sequences at the end. Chris Pratt is supposed to be a scientist, a clever guy, so how he thinks he can take on an alien ship which has spawned THOUSANDS of White Spikes, just with a small band of humans, just makes absolutely no sense at all.

Coupled with very satisfying visceral action & keeping the unnecessary comedy to the minimum, it's a great way to spend 2 hours on a cold, stormy Saturday evening.And then it makes you want to fire up Mass Effect, to fight your way through the galaxy alongside the criminally underrated Yvonne Strahovsky.8/10 would definitely watch again very soon.",The Tomorrow War

Pity the script didn't though! It's all mostly been seen before, the characterisation is thin and the end is a total cheese-fest. I'm sure the writers felt all clever with their aliens representing an environmental 'tipping point' - reference, polar ice melting releasing methane (read some science on the subject) but it is the ONLY clever bit. If you can put up with all this, then the action scenes are worth it. 8/10 for the action, 2/10 for the woke storyline, such as it is.",The Tomorrow War

1709,Jefferson_Jensen,It got better as it went on,7,6 July 2021,"I'll be honest going into this: I'm not a big fan of time travel because it's either overly explained to cover plot holes or not explained enough and leaves me grasping to understand. This movie was a mix of both. The entire time travel thing here made no sense but it tried to explain it which made it more confusing and while watching the looooong drawn out action sequences I kept thinking back about X,Y,Z time travel scenarios. That aside, Dan (Chris Pratt) started off as a generic hero but I think came full circle with his own arch by the time the movie ended and the parallels between his character's arch and his father (JK Simmons) arch went well together. None of the characters from the future seemed really fleshed out and ended up being ""red shirt"" characters. The visuals were nice. The CGI looked pretty good, even when you looked at it for a long time. A lot of movies focus on the monster for too long and you end up noticing the costume or the faulty CG if the camera lingers but this wasn't the case. I won't spoil it cause that's not my style of review, but I'll say that as the ending drew closer and the lore became more detailed I became more invested. It's worth a watch.",The Tomorrow War

Cannot stress this enough - if you need believeability to enjoy a film, stay away.From the start, out of place mini scenes and characters obviously there to telegraph mid to late movie plot pointsPlot armour for the leads******e *****e causes everything, didn't you know.Much of the dialogue is triple cheeseburger level of cheeseIf you cant overcome any of the above, you will not like this film. I took off one star for all of them, whereas I completely understand how some may take off 9 stars for it.Or if you don't like gore. Whilst the movie starts slow, you will know when it starts as the graphic brutality shows itself unexpectedly, and when its on this movie isnt afraid to dispose of flimsy humans (it keeps the blood levels low too so in a way it is ""happy friendly"" brutality).If you can suspend the emotions due to the film ruiners above (or perhaps they aren't film ruiners for you), and you want a big SciFi (ish) blockbuster CGI monster film, this is for you.The action is the best I've seen in years, the first monster reveal is superb (possibly the best ever), and I was able to enjoy this as a blockbuster and laugh at the stupidity of it all - the film rarely takes itself seriously, and when it does it is one of the telegraphed ""insert emotion here"" moments so you shouldn't be surprised by it.Visuals, CGI is top notch, sound design is incredible, and I enjoyed much of the humour - its not sophisticated and doesn't break any new ground, but the actors pull it off.Obviously films cannot be made by big companies now without some form of social or political messaging, and whilst it is here in the diversity of the cast - it didn't impact as the film is not trying to be Saving Private Ryan. In any case it is token as the film leans heavily on the ""Americans are the only ones who can save the world"" trope. Seriously, its 2021, why are Americans afraid of accents?I will leave the ******e *****e one out of this so as not to spoil, but again it is not delivered in a preachy manner so it didn't bother me.Summary: Very, very stupid film, and I loved it.",The Tomorrow War

But along side all the fun fact there are some issues that would bother any viewer, first of all they are fighting a 30 years later war but there is no futuristic car! No futuristic weapon nothing is futuristic at all, maybe I missed something but I see no future in this movie except the time-machine technology which shows a new theory of time-travel that when they open a tunnel, there is only a way between two exact times not more which was really smart and I would say new in time travelling theories at least the way they showed it, also There was a plot hole in how and why these monsters came to earth.All the thing I said was from my perspective so it may be completely wrong but however I suggest this movie to anyone who like action, monsters and gun fires.",The Tomorrow War

It was pretty silly and superficial, but had some humour, a decent pace and some likeable characters. But the laziness did irk at times.For example: everyone shoots bullets at the creatures, over and over and over again, very, very noisily, and nothing seems to happen. Okay, it's an action/scifi movie, I can tolerate that. But once you've established that shooting lots and lots of bullets at those things doesn't appear to stop them, do we really need more scenes in which it happens over and over again?? It was just noise. At least Kirk hobbled off and tried to think of another strategy when the zipped-up Gorn wasn't too fussed by being smacked!Good writers would have used this as a means of moving things on, but these writers just kept rinsing and repeating. Because they already had their third act, so all of this action was taking us nowhere. It was as if the over-long length of the movie had been pre-ordained and they just had to keep pausing to fill up some time.So it was okay-ish as escapism, but my goodness there were times when it was irritating.",The Tomorrow War

I feel like this movie could of been a great but drawn out tv series but was more enjoyable as a film. Pretty much all the side characters are fun and likeable which is rare and you end up rooting for them to survive especially as they don't act like the typically well trained to survive all kinds of apocalypse characters you see in movies. Chris Pratt was an interesting but likeable choice as the lead. He seemed to put his usual comedic shtick aside to shed more light on the funny supporting cast.

1764,ahllled,Decent lengthy action.,3,6 November 2021,"The movie didn't take any time to introduce the characters, and time didn't work consistently enough.Plot twisting wasn't exiting enough as emotional connections between characters wasn't really there, and even the scenes with the big reveals were under-tuned by dialog, sitting and music.Ending came twice. At one point you'll think it's over and it should have, but the movie drags itself to the other ending; nether of them is meaningful.For what it is it's a decent action movie, don't try to think or interpret what's happening.",The Tomorrow War

That is until the final act. For goodness sake what is it about Americans and their need for super cheesy cliche moments in films? Why are films constantly ruined by this awful awful sentimental tripe. I very nearly didn't make it to the end. Such a shame, if it had ended after the second act it would have got a 7 or maybe an 8, no let's not get carried away it would have been a 7. Oh Mr Pratt you can do so much better.",The Tomorrow War

1769,ace_ventura-69654,A definite must see!,10,10 July 2021,"I don't understand reviewers complaining about the Plot and storyline.Yes, it is a time-travel movie and usually time travel movies are hard to fit in what maybe reality would be. If you are one of those who complains about the logic of time travel then I guess you had your brain in airplane mode when watching ""Back to future"" (rated 8.5/10). BTW, I am not comparing this movie with Back to the future, just comparing the reviewers choice to turn their brains on and off when seeing time travel stuff.Computer graphics are awesome. War scenes are desperate and full of suspense.A definite must see!",The Tomorrow War
1770,atulgupta-51816,Entertaining but don't think too much.,5,16 July 2021,"It's an entertaining movie that tries hilariously to connect all the dots into a coherent narrative.They projected the movie as ""war with aliens"" but it wasn't a war at all. Aliens were not trained soldiers skilled in warfare and military strategy. They were basically an invasive animal species that is also unnaturally violent and hostile (so similar to humans then lol)Also, why is there only one female in the entire species? Even if there were more, such gender imbalance would never allow a species to become his big. If you say ""oh they're like ants"", ants live in places where food is abundant and isn't fighting back.Bombs and bullets can kill them. Armies would have a field day with such a species.Overall, it's a watchable film if you don't get too much into the specifics.",The Tomorrow War
1771,adelao-02096,Just nonsense,1,8 July 2021,"Nice special effects, 1 start is because of them, but the plot is just total nonsense. The world unites to send troops into the future, but the when the guy comes back with the toxin that could stop the war from ever happening, the entire world goes crazy, everyone starts to riot cause the world will end in 30 years? What kind of bs is that? Not to mention he had the toxin in his hand all through the fights and temporal jump and it did not break, what was that vial made of? Titanium?",The Tomorrow War

There's some good effects, some not so good effects, and a cornball family story. Chris Pratt is good in the lead role. It's very predictable and characters do dumb things that create suspense. The last act features some absurd action and is overloaded by hero moments. All those negative things aside, I did enjoy it for the popcorn movie that it is.",The Tomorrow War
1773,reyvencules,Popcorn!,6,15 July 2021,"Sci-fi/Time travel movies could both go deliver a bad or great execution. It needs a concrete explanation for the plot to move forward or back and forth, but this movie just get on with it and just use whatever a 'time travelling' can do for the characters halfway through the movie. There's so much plotholes. I guess, for me, it only exist for entertainment purposes only. I still partially enjoyed it though. Good for popcorn but not for the brain.",The Tomorrow War

I'm no Stephen Hawkins..... but even I understand the basic principles of time travel (I know it's not real, but seriously!)
So they come from the future, alter the timeline for everyone, know where and when the aliens arrive, yet not until the end after thousands of dead and injured, does anyone t to look at the area they came from. And even then it's down to a school child!?!But this isn't even the worse part.So Chris P is sent to the future and leaves the family, however when in the future his daughter has the memories of an entirely different timeline?He's just left!!!!!! That means the other timeline NEVER HAPPENED?!?!?I could understand if instead of time travel, it was travel to a parallel universe, but it's not so this can't happen.Had the writer never seen Doctor Who / Terminator / Back to the future 1/2/3If you can block this out of your mind watch the movie.

The action was nonstop and the creatures were a genuine threat.The only negative was Charlie's intro. The character was immediately annoying, however his after the first encounter with the Aliens, Charlie wasn't around until the final act.Nice creature design that borrowed from a few other movies but the spikes and head design as well as the ""clicking"" sounds we're spot on.Only the music was below par. A mediocre rip off Zimmer score IMO.Acting was good and I appreciated the effort to sidestep cliche, despite the movie leveraging many tropes. Overall well worth the time and highly entertaining. So entertaining I would gladly watch it again.",The Tomorrow War

I loved Life and I'm putting this right next to it.I felt emotions I haven't felt since Endgame.The acting was solid and the monsters were great. In a long time female hero was cool too, without shoveling it down the throat. They could have used more time on the father- son thing, but it would have been a longer movie and I think there was a time restriction.Love Sam Richardson and i loved him as the comic releaf, no matter how cliche it was.Time travel is always messy, but this made it entertaining af.

It then falls apart with numerous monumental holes in the story, severe cliches and shallow characterisations. It becomes unwatchable until it reaches farcical levels, becoming so bad it becomes a default comedy. Atrocious movie making that has CGI as its only redeeming feature to stop it being 1 star.

For a film so predictable it threw a half decent plot turn. But it would of had to be a truly amazing last 30mins to save the utter boredom & awfulness of the rest of the movie. The script is horrific & the acting which is getting progressively worse in film is particularly bad here. JK Simmons & Sam Richardson are the only ones who come out unscathed. It is also such a shame to see somebody as talented as Yvonne Strahovski wasted in a film like this. Chris Pratt looks confused about what he's meant to be doing the whole time.Think Netflix & Amazon need to give up making big budget movies, their return of quality is absolutely horrendous. Not just is this bringing the standard of quality in the movie industry down but the quality of the acting from the supporting cast in their movies is bringing the standard of acting down across the board aswell.",The Tomorrow War

Strong 'The Edge of Tomorrow' vibes and monsters are similar in a way. Chris Pratt's doing a good job and the intensity is there.The plot is of course not so great, filled with holes and requires you to turn off at least 30% of your brain. Otherwise the movie is very watchable, until you get 3/4 through and then SUPER CHEESE, they basically ruin the movie and take away all rational and make it a big joke.",The Tomorrow War

I think this movied would have improved massively with a different ending. The actions of the gaggle of idiots at the end of the movie should have set the apocaplypse in motion instead of shopping it. They went back, found the space ship and released the aliens ahead of time. Sad ending. But much better. And why didn't the look for weapons on the space ship.

There's an anti-originality attitude infecting the internet nowadays,7,8 July 2021,"I applaud the creators of TTW for going all out on this.The plot made enough sense for me too.It's corny.It's unabashedly hammy.It's FULL of ridiculous coincidences.But it's also a clever,**completely original** science fiction story,Which is increasingly rare!They say if you've been separated from something long enough,Even something that's good for you,You'll see it as the enemy, as something wrong.The anger being shown towards the film is emblematic of this, and it brings me so much dismay.That people would actively discourage others to support original storytelling.I really hope people come round to it,And vote with their money for original storytelling to come back again!A solid 7/10 from me 🤘Also, take Blomkamp and Oats Studios:Who are on a determined crusade to create *only* original features.It's disheartening to see how many people are just happy to lap up the conveyor belt franchises forever.It's so shortsighted.What are we on, our seventh Batman adaptation now?And look I love Batman, but surely the world is big enough for a bit more variety?Anyway, that's my little soapbox there.

And the answer is yes, a hundred times yes. It could possibly have been okay if things had made sense, like if they didn´t have tiny women in charge of everything in the military, holding guns that they wouldn´t be able to carry in real life etc. But that was only the start of things not making sense (I´m not talking about aliens and time travel, I would totally suspend my disbelief for those things).

To be fair, he seems aware he's in the wrong movie, and is just killing time 'til he gets back to killing dinosaurs.Giving it three points because of some fun action sequences and creature design, but, damn, this was a hard slog to get through. The characters and script got dumber by the minute, like it was a competition by the screenwriters to see how far they could go before breaking the audience.Some actors thought they were in a comedy, others a drama. Some movies can pull this off; Armageddon, for example, was emotionally manipulative and funny in the right doses, with good timing and rhythm. Pratt fails to hold this balance. He's trying for the sympathetic every-man, but he really comes off as depressed and distracted.This would have worked much better on the SyFy channel, playing up the spectacle of epic high stakes battle with ridiculously bad decision making.",The Tomorrow War

I laughed as I read some of the other reviews where time travel ""experts"" weighed in on why the time travel timeline plot wouldn't work. It's funny that their total knowledge of that is based on other movies! Call me simple, but I don't think that impacted my enjoyment of the movie!

Like 2h18 for something that could've been handled in 1h40 if they didn't add the boring father-daughters scenes.The movie starts well but when the MC finds out his daughter is the chief of the whole operation, the movie becomes pretty boring and the writers forgot there's not only two characters in this movie. Like, for 55:00 to 1 hour and half I think (when she dies), the movie only focus about him and his daughter, but we don't care at all. That's why I wanted to give a 6 to the movie but the last scene made me change my mind and add a star.The movie ends well but I don't understand why they want to do a sequel to this movie.

It's a little bit like Starship Troopers but I like this more and I think all the hate will make this some kind of cult classic in the future. It's a little bit like all the alien films out there rolled into one and if you can forget about all of them then this one stands alone quite well. As far as plot holes go, I think the idea is that there is just a lot of stuff that isn't explained and the main character doesn't know what's going on either. For example, how did the alien ship get here? Nobody knows and that's ok. There are mysteries in life and mysteries are cool. The only real negatives in this film are the overblown and silly end fight scene and a couple of aspects of the main alien. These things I can ignore because the rest of the film was fun and entertaining. I also think the main plot is actually pretty cool.

If they were worried about stuff like paradoxes then this is one of the ""single timeline"" sort of universes, but then they kind of chicken out and make it a multiverse were you can actually change the future so the entire premise of sending millions of people to get eaten in the future makes no sense. Just send back samples and all the info relating the location and we could have found the ship and blew it up.But what really twisted my panties is that the last guys coming back form the future right before the gate collapsed aren't even debriefed, apparently no one cares to know what happened. ""Oh, they made this toxin and told us to mass produce it and kill the aliens? We have no time for that now, you go ahead in your kitchen."" Preposterous. Even if the American government was that dumb the next step would be going to the Russian embassy, that's a nightmare in itself but still better than doing nothing. But didn't even bother to make a tweet about it, off they went, the only people who knew anything about the threat - to the unexplored Russian tundra with half a dozen idiots without so much as leaving behind a sample and a map with a lawyer.

I usually hate movies that deal with time travel, but they explained a scenario that was at least plausible for why they could only jump between those 2 points in time. I'm also not usually a fan of alien movies, but for some reason, I really liked this one...can't even pinpoint why exactly. I think it balanced the alien screen time well so that wasn't what you were watching 100% of the time. I've seen a few reviews mention that it felt like an 80s or 90s action movie and I feel like that is spot on - maybe that's why I liked it so much, because 80s and 90s action movies are still some of the best in my opinion. It also felt like we were dealing with real everyday people and emotions and there was actually an underlying family storyline, which I liked.The only part for me that felt disjointed was the last ~40 minutes. I won't say specifics so as not to include spoilers, but it felt like a different movie at that point. It felt like they could have taken that and made a sequel VERY easily. The movie up to that point was explained in a plausible enough way that I was forgiving of it, but the ""2nd Act"" if you will, had way more plot holes and had the characters doing things that didn't make any sense and frankly were kind of stupid.BUT, that being said, I'll totally watch it again. My husband absolutely loved it, and was caught multiple times while watching it saying ""this movie is so cool!"". And he liked it so much that he invited friends over to watch it a 2nd time, the day after we first watched it. Overall, very enjoyable. Perfect blend of action, humor, and heart.

The action is good with moments of greatness. Yvonne Strahovski being the best in action, acting, & storyline despite it still being kinda cheesy/predictable.Now the cons. I really enjoy Pratt in Parks & Recreation and almost equally Guardians but I already saw bit lacking in his dramatic acting in the guardians sequel, but this seriously highlights it. He really tries to match Yvonnes caliber or even Simmons, who honestly looks like he is struggling to even put in effort for the flat emotionless storyline between him and his disconnected son who big surprise, apparently lives up to the barely overused scenario of ""like father like son"" (you'll get there if you dont fall asleep twice like I did before making through it completely on my third view).I seriously though dont want to bring this movie down cause the production designers behind this are truly spectacular and deserve prob an oscar for originality if thats even a category, cant even remember the last time I saw the oscars come to think of it.Anyways Ill just end with if you enjoy great special effects (I mean seriously freaking jaw dropping sometimes in 4k) while laughing at the almost parody of a mystery 3000 movie script, for example Simmons literally says the word ""something"" twice in a sentence as if to say nobody ""gave me a line so I said it"" TWICE with a face of like ""seriously?"" Oh ya or when someone says 3min till we bomb the city, literally 7 seconds later boom. Or later how an entire like 5 days pass by this time in less than 7 minutes. Honestly I dont wanna put too much blame on the director cuz clearly he got plenty right, but to follow the blueprint that was that screenplay, well lets just say if he was building a house it would be somehow be inside out, yet surprisingly at angles eye catching.A mess of a movie with some great eye candy.",The Tomorrow War

1865,ActionJunkie007,If you can get past the writing....,5,1 August 2021,"...then you'll probably enjoy some really fantastic cgi and action sequences. It has a good cast of characters which are likeable enough to help sit through the run time but if you stop to think even once about what's happening in the plot or why this dialog or joke is being said at this point in the story, it will take you out of the movie to such a high degree that it becomes distracting.Spoilers below:The biggest issue is that no one ever once thinks about the possibility of altering the course of their alien infested future by preparing the past with all the data they've collected and the coordinates of the first sighting. The dialog and the plot are all directed toward saving the 500K future survivors of Earth when by going back in time would ultimately cancel that future out .If we use the logic of time travel they went with , alternate time lines, there was no reason to send anyone to the future. They were smart enough to know they couldn't have two people together at the same time or else the current timeline would be locked/paradox but not smart enough to just send all their research, samples and data to the past so within 30 years, we can develop a way to kill the aliens in the future? They had to send untrained draft picks to the future to be slaughtered while they work solely in the future under an intense time crunch to solve the problem just so they can send the solution back to the past??Again, if you don't bother to make sense of it, it's got some great action eye candy.

1876,rainydayjapan,Mediocre Review for a Mediocre Movie,4,6 July 2021,"The movie got off to a bad start, then moved on to a mediocre middle, and then almost but didn't quite redeem itself towards the end.Some other reviewers have raised the Edge of Tomorrow as a comparison and I think that is a really useful way of illustrating why the first half of this movie is so bad. Both the Edge of Tomorrow and The Tomorrow War are stories based in a ludicrous alien invasion scenario with a time travel element that, if one has time to think about it, makes no sense at all.The Edge of Tomorrow gets around that problem by never giving you time to think about it. It just throws Tom Cruise right into the deep end from the beginning and he is pretty much constantly in action from that point on. Its a great way of letting the audience's brains suspend their sense of disbelief and just enjoy the ridiculous story as it unfolds. You are just too worried about what is going to happen to poor Tom next to think about all the plot holes. I quite liked that one.The Tomorrow War makes the mistake of not doing that and instead starting off as a story about a suburban dad (well, you get a very brief preview of him in the future before that but not much). This is a very boring way to start a movie and, more importantly, it gives the audiences' brains time to relax and think about what they are seeing. Suddenly the main character's suburban existence is punctured when a bunch of heavily armed people from the future materialize on the field of a soccer game they are watching on TV and everything goes downhill from there.The future people tell us there is an alien invasion they are having trouble fighting and they need people from the present to time travel to the future to serve as cannon fodder in their war against the aliens. So they set up this massive recruitment and time travel infrastructure to send everyone from now to die in the future. Much screen time is spent walking the main character through this process. This gives the audience time to activate their sense of disbelief. If they can travel through time, instead of setting up this massive and horrific system for getting people killed why don't they just, you know, devote those resources to helping people in the present prepare to defeat the alien invasion? Or something like that? This is clumsily addressed with some expository dialogue much later in the movie, but by then you've lost interest anyway.The movie gets a bit better when it moves into the future and they are actually fighting the aliens. Here too though you find yourself wondering why, if they can invent time travel, they can't invent firearms powerful enough to be useful against the aliens. But I digress.For me the only part of the movie that really worked was towards the end, when Chris Pratt and friends have returned to the present with a mission to destroy the aliens there (or should I say then). It basically plays out as a straight up buddies on a mission to kill some monsters narrative from then on and is competently executed. It helps that J. K. Simmons gets most of his screen time during that part, he is always fantastic and did a good job of making me actually care about what was happening on screen because I didn't want his character to die.So I finished the movie in a more positive mood than I had spent most of its running time in, but it wasn't enough to save it for me.",The Tomorrow War

Well, it could have been made more believable with good writing. That's my major gripe. Dialog poor, character development not so much.Here are my problems with it.1) 30 years in the future, weaponry hasn't changed nearly at all. Rifles are tricked out cosmetically but are essentially M16s with the usual ""infinite capacity"" magazines we see everywhere. Helicopters are from the 60s...2) Drafting ordinary citizens to head 30 years into the future to help kill aliens with zero training/conditioning, etc. Is just stupid. Cannon fodder and that's all.3) The volcano theory is expanded by talking to a .... 12yr old volcano fan ... rather than the scores of real volcano experts??? Really?4) Others have commented on the ridiculous final act where eight people go, on their own, to eliminate a threat -- that won't even exist for nearly 30 years.And, finally the reason I wrote this review:When Muri and Dan are working on the killer toxin at 01:22:08 and say goodnight, he says"" Good night, Chickpea.""

1888,rtets,"Pretty Frustrating Characters, Haven't Thought Out Time Travel Enough",7,4 July 2021,"Overall, this isn't as bad as all the 1 star reviews are saying... but they have a point.The most frustrating thing is the fact that none of the characters in the 2020 timeline are prepping for the invasion. They're just blindly panicking about the assumed inevitability of their demise. Why don't they do the research in the past, send samples home and have 30 years to research them? Make better weapons?It's also pretty obvious that these primitive monkey aliens aren't going to be flying any spaceships. So in the 2020 timeline why don't Russia start thinking about how to identify the landing site? Even when they still think the aliens arrive in 2046 they could be building better radar in the region etcThey didn't convincingly explain the way time worked in the story very well. Why did changes in the 2020 timeline not impact the 2050 timeline? If the answer is parallel realities, then they should have said that. They put more effort into explaining the two versions of one person issue than the larger paradox of how did the guy collect the toxin from the future if the war never happened.The ending was really frustrating too. In as much as it was so crazily reckless to risk starting the war in 2020. When they found the ship, they had 30 years to figure out how to eliminate everything on it with 0% risk of escape. Instead only 8 people said ""let's just do it now and get home in time for dinner"" and nearly let them all escape.Despite these many frustrations, it was definitely not 1 star bad. It's not very original and borrows shamelessly from so many other movies (eg the ending reveal is basically the same idea as Prometheus).On balance, I enjoyed it but it could have been so much better. A good place to start would've been to make the characters a bit less stupid.",The Tomorrow War

Chris Pratt brings us a character that is relatable and grounded. There is no extreme left/right issues being pushed.... Which is why the critics will hate it. It does touch a little on PTSD which I think is important.

It was action packed, smart without being a brain overload and had enough going on to keep my attention! It was cheesy at times but I can let it slide, it wasn't enough to become annoying and even got me a bit emosh at times! I am pregnant though so it was more likely hormones! This isn't the film of the year but it is a great bit of fun in a time when I'd say we are pretty devoid of good sci-fi movies! The acting overall was pretty good and I thought the aliens were pretty well done, certainly a lot better than other alien based movies over the past few years which have been quite frankly flat and lacking!

1904,GiftsoftheGab,Great Sci-Fi action flick backed with a heart,9,3 July 2021,"Great sci-fi action flick that's better than most of what's out there currently. Lets go with the feedback sandwich trying to avoid spoilers:
PROs: Chris Pratt's acting spot on for the character. I was impressed. You're drawn into the action/fighting scenes. What really drew me to love this movie is that is wonderfully weaves in: family values; forgiveness; the bond & relationship between father and daughter(s) & the love in the bond despite past/future mistake & how that gells with Pratt's characters strained relationship with his own father...
CONs: a couple of 'to dumb to live' moments but done for right reasons & due to integrity of character; popping in a 'global warming' message -- ghrr -- but there was no lecturing so it was ignorable & pros well outweigh this; a few small parts where sound could be improved -- not many.People that watch the start but do not finish the movie will not see what appear dumb orders end up having a VERY important reason & makes sense at end.There were some parts towards start that seem very video gamey but I'd say they were going for it & it's a game I'd probably enjoy ;)
PROs: ...again what stuck with me most was how the relationship between Pratt's character's daughter(s) mirrored his issues with his own father and how the characters grew. How no-matter how bad things seem there is always hope & in the end it's regular people that fix things not the 'government' and/or 'elites'.There's so much more I can say but want to avoid spoilers. All I can say is what til the end.Go in expecting an ordinary action flick & you'll be pleasantly surprised that it ends up being more.There is some violence (by aliens) but overall it's a fairly family friendly movie. I recommend.",The Tomorrow War

It is watchable.The trouble for this reviewer is that it had all been seen before, and although that in itself doesn't lose stars (as let's be honest there are not many novel ideas out there now!), the other films had done it noticeably better!Even as a non-Tom Cruise fan, his ""Live, Die, Repeat"" with it's very similar premise was infinitely more watchable and memorable.The complete rip off of what looked like a whole scene from the classic ""The Thing"" also seemed a tad too much that the novel ideas had run out. And that is only one example!I don't mind Chris Pratt but he shines more as the reluctant hero when surrounded by dinosaurs or his Guardians co-stars. As a lone ""leading man"" hero, he does not have the star power to carry a film - or at least not this one.The sort of film to have on in the background to keep kids quiet or to gaze at whilst doing your laundry. Watchable rubbish but instantly forgettable.",The Tomorrow War

The CGI of the aliens is well done there almost like an up to date take on the film Independence Day.Only negative comment is it lacked originality even tho they traveled to the future to fight the aliens you feel like the outcome wasn't much different from all the other alien sci-if films that come before it.Still worth the watch.",The Tomorrow War

But alas, He lived up to his work. There were scenes I The visual effects in this film we outstanding especially during the overly drawn out scene of Chris Pratt's future daughter falling into the monsters in the water. Like bruh (the writers)...why the heck would you Chris pratt dumb enough to be willing to die for his daughter? In the future?? With the serum that could make all these future events avoidable????? There should have been a better explanation on the aliens..that would have been cool. The scientists couldn't figure out in 5 years but a kid knew in 5 minutes???Also, the guy who made this movie is a visual effects artist but a bland writer so there's thatThe movie on the ""important government guy is saying no because he doesn't believe in anything""? A huge cliche and very unoriginal. The government official didn't let Chris Pratt go to Russia to destroy this ship that could save humanity because of tax payer dollars??? Lmao what??? The future is finished and you're concerned about tax payer dollars that won't even matter in a few months.What's the point of fighting this future war when 90% of your military isn't trained or have 0 knowledge on the enemy? You're sending them to die at that point.Lol also, 85% of those ""soldiers"" immediately plummeted to their death when plunging into the future. I wonder how much those extras got paid to die after 30 seconds..I did appreciate the humor, it was a fun movie, and I kind of like Chris Pratt.

Just take parts of other movies and give it a kinda new story line and BAM! You got a winner. Chris McKay should never be allowed near a movie set again. The premise requires a person with no more than a 4th grade understanding of science. Also, are we not aware that the US is 13% black? 13%... that's how ""diverse"" a thing has to be to align with the actual demographics of the country. That said, the main actors were good, and unfortunately wasted on Prime's latest pile of stolen, nonsensical garbage.

I know this has been brought up in other reviews, but it makes that much of a difference that it needs to be brought up. Dan Forester (Chris Pratt) feels that he needs to save his daughter in the future after bringing the toxin back to his timeline, even though that theoretically once he makes use of the toxin in his timeline, there would be no need to go back to the other timeline to save older Muri. Either Dan Forester wasn't sure of how time travelling works, or the writers didn't explain it properly in the script.At the end of the movie, I can't get my head around why they had to go and kill the aliens alone, and why they couldn't have waited and at least tried to convince some higher up in the government to send an army searching for that ship.It's probably just me, but I hate when at the end of a movie like this one, the hero doesn't get recognition for what he accomplished, which to me was the biggest disappointment of this movie. Would have loved to seen this movie be like 10 minutes longer just so they could drag an alien corpse back (or what's left of one) to America and show the world that not only did they find the creatures in their current timeline, but they also wiped them out and that there is nothing to worry about for the future concerning these aliens.I also would have loved if they could have explored the pilots of the ship a bit more and gone more in depth to figure that out.",The Tomorrow War

1957,rossjayp,"Good enough for a popcorn flick, but they needed to fill a few plot holes",5,7 July 2021,"From a pure action movie perspective the movies checks all the boxes. It is fun enough to watch, especially if you have had a few cocktails. However, the big reveal at the end should have actually be the very start of the movie.Warning: SpoilersThe people in the future figure out a way to stop the war from ever happening, but they need enough time to complete the work so they can send the solution back in time. This is why they need all the soldiers from the past, to hold off the enemy long enough for the solution to be finished.However, in the closing act, most of the aliens are killed off fairly easily with some military grade explosives (and a glorified knife fight).The entire premise of the movie is ruined in the final act. First, in about 2 minutes 2 scientist and a high-school student figure out what the entire world has not yet figured out (where the bad guys came from). You have to believe that aside from sending all of our soldiers to the future that we would have had every scientist on the planet trying to figure out where the aliens came from, but no, it takes a high school kid to figure it out.Second, it shows that a coordinated pre-emptive military strike could have easily stopped the war from starting. Therefore, the solution from the future was not needed, just the information about where the war started and a few samples from some of the dead aliens would have been enough to end the problem before it started.This could have been saved with some ground hog day, edge of tomorrow (lie, die, repeat), style time-looping, where they keep trying different things, failing, and having to try something else. They could even have alluded to it similar to the Avengers Infinity War scene where Dr. Strange mentions that he looked at 14 Million, 605 possibilities and only one worked. They could have even done that as part of the news briefing in the first act, or as the pre-combat briefing all the new soldiers get in the second act.Instead we are left with a head scratcher of a plot hole that kind of ruins the movie.",The Tomorrow War

1966,brownblythe,"For some, this may be the best movie of the year.",7,3 July 2021,"I consider this movie to be one of my favourite blockbusters ever.The movie has a timely and important message about our responsibility to our children and grandchildren to keep the world safe and habitable, and the necessity of making some sacrifices to do so.I have watched the film three times in as many days, and I think that most concerns about the film are overdone. I do not consider there to be distracting plot holes and I do not think that the movie is overlong. I also do not consider it to be merely a re-creation of the 2014 movie Edge of Tomorrow.The special effects are competently done, and it is obvious that the screen writers paid special attention to what was written. The movie takes itself seriously, but there is some well-timed and well needed comic relief.It's not a book by Tolstoy, and it's not intended to be. It's primarily exists as a means to entertain. But it does so with aplomb.For me, it's a solid 10. Try it! You may love it as I do.",The Tomorrow War

1971,torturedwriter-44699,"An imperfect, but great bit of fun.",8,11 July 2021,"Reading some of the negative reviews on here, I feel like maybe the last few years have drained humanity of their ability to just enjoy something. People picking apart the time travel logic in this movie must be real fun at parties. Seriously, time travel doesn't actually make sense, that's why it's Science Fiction not a documentary. I mean, the entire of Terminators time travel story never made sense. If they succeeded in killing Sarah Conner, then John Conner never would have been born and the Terminators never would have gone back in time to stop him being born, therefore he would have been born... Yet he was only born because they went back in time so he never could have been born in the first place... The time travel in Avengers Endgame made even less sense and that's the highest grossing movie of all time, and loved probably by so many of the same people rubbishing the inconsistencies in this film. Time travel in movies, even the best ones NEVER makes sense. So why are we expecting it to now?No doubt this movie has some silly plot holes, silly dialogue, some silly occurrences, and to be honest, loses points for feeling a little B-Grade. But what it is, is a great bit of good old fashioned action. It's entertaining. It's fun. It's epic in scale. It's even quite sweet. And if you stop taking yourself so seriously expecting a documentary from a sci-fi alien time travel movie, you will probably actually enjoy yourself.",The Tomorrow War

Why dont you try and make a movie on this scale. We loved it so much weve ended up watching it twice in one day lol. Chris Pratt did justice and suited the role well. Always love his movies!loved the funny soft jokes too to add to the entertainment but they didnt let go of the seriousness of the situation. Supporting actors all did a fabulous job too. Loved the variation of ethicities in the movie. The intensity and entertainment factor was 10 on 10. Story was brilliant. People who dont understand the convulated universe will find it hard to understand. Listen to Dolores Cannon then youll know that this is possible in certain loop or portals on earth. This movie was epic on every scale. The aliens werr scary and very well made. It would have been a thrilling experience in cinemas. Loved it at home too.

1981,billdehaan-61219,"Great cast, good acting and effects, laughable screenplay",6,5 July 2021,"No plot details are spoiled here, but I do talk about a couple of tropes that are invoked. Fair warning.This is one of those ""oh, come on now"" movies where the premise is so ridiculous that you just have to shut your brain off and not take it seriously. That's a shame, because for the most part, the family-oriented story aspects are well told, and the actors range from good to top notch (J. K Simmons in particular).Of course, there are all the tropes. The disowned father just happens to have the skills and resources needed at the end of the movie to force a reconciliation. The team trying to save the world from a future apocalypse, which includes people that the government knows are from the future, can't get scientists to research their theory, but the lead character is a science teacher, and one of the kids in his class just happens to be OCD about volcanoes, and has the answer they need.But for the most part, they skip over that silly stuff. Even the obnoxious comic relief character gets little screen time until after he's redeemed, fortunately.But the elephant in the room is the stupidity of the basic premise. The world is going to be destroyed by aliens, so they need to take people from the current time into the future as soldiers. It's like the John Varley book (and movie) Millenium, except without the logic or internal consistency.If the world was going to be attacked by aliens, instead of just taking cannon fodder from the past, and doing research work in the future, why not send all of the research data back to the past and have the productivity of a world NOT under siege work on weapons and defences in preparation?Which is what a core group of about 10 people do at the end, but of course, they're doing it without government approval.If you can ignore the stunning flaws in logic, it's a well-acted and presented action movie, but it's hard to take seriously.",The Tomorrow War

The background music was done really well that truly expresses the environment and the feel of intensity. The action was really good especially for an Amazon prime movie. Also it felt like they didn't let you have any questions at the end which was pretty satisfying.

Those creatures were the only things in the movie that looked and seemed interesting.However, from shallow characters, shaky motivations, cringe action movie dialogues, tried and true tropes done bad to stupid application of the simple science of time travel- this movie fails at every single one of these things.Dan (Chris Pratt) is every bit of annoying that Star-Lord is without Gamora's wit and charm. And it is painful to watch. The women in this movie are the same washed-out ""strong female characters"" with no personality. The other characters have throw away lives, are the same ol' tropy characters and we feel no remorse when all those lives were lost. You don't even remember most of their names.And I can't even begin to explain how the movie scientifically and logically makes no sense. What's the point of this movie? The only thing that is clear to me from what Pratt's character did in this movie was that he created a paradox and now is in a time loop. A simple google search would tell you about relativity, time travel, wormholes and the simple grandfather paradox.In conclusion, this movie was a waste of time and budget. The movie looked good but that's all. It was an absolute disappointment. It's entertaining, yeah sure. All the elements are there- Alien, Time travel, Action, the budget to make it all work.

Chris Pratt is great, and Yvonne Strahovski gives a solid performance in a strong female role. Ryan Keira Armstrong also gives a memorably endearing performance. I think the father daughter relationship is expressed in a very impactful and inspiring way. But, several of the plot points take very heavy handed ""inspiration"" from other films like Edge of Tomorrow (obvious, right?), Transformers, and War of the Worlds. Some of the imagery is very reminiscent of something out of the Alien franchise. One brief clip could have easily been stolen from the The Matrix B-roll... It's not just plot points and the imagery that seems cliché, some of the dialogue felt very familiar. In fact, I'm pretty sure one key conversation was actually paraphrased from The Core. All in all, the movie had its moments. However, on top of the borderline plagiarism was also a litany of weak dialogue and corny scenes. At some point I was just ready for it to be over.

Plenty of action-oriented Sci-Fi movies have accomplished this -- and I'm not talking about great Sci-Fi movies either. They move along quickly enough and have enough internal logic to hold one's attention for 90 to 120 minutes.""The Tomorrow War"" is not able to accomplish this. The plot is threadbare, the dialog badly written, The character's tissue paper thin; pacing and tempo are essentially absent. Even the action sequences are boring.

The trailer pretty much tells you the whole story, humanity is losing a war in the future vs aliens and needs more soldiers. It plays out almost exactly as expected from there. Most of which is fine mindless action, some of the suspenseful scenes when they first arrive in the future are really well done. Unfortunately the ending really falls flat and is where the film lost me, the entire world goes from unified in a fight for existence to brink of chaos rioting in the streets for similarly no reason other than giving a half baked excuse for Chris Pratt and company to be the ones that have to save to world.

They're going against a major threat to humanity with 1990's technology. No use of drones, robots, proper body armor. Just guns and weirdly good communications. Plus the time travel thing.The conscripts receive no training at all. They don't even tell them where the aliens are vulnerable. With the time they got on their hands, it should seem that they could at least relay this information to them, and perhaps some tactical and weapons training.Ridiculous amount of bullets in magazinesNow to the story line.A lot of really close calls, to a point at which everything is kind of predictable.Nobody seems to be looking for a solution. In 2022, almost everybody seems to have given up already. They're not really pulling any resources to train or equip their soldiers.The time traveling aspect is not fully logical. I don't want to get into all of it but here are some (Spoiler alert):
There is one scene in which Dan jumps down a hole to help capture an alien. He was forbidden to do so beforehand, but with his help the alien is captured. He is criticized for endangering himself, but the thing is, they already know the exact time at which he is going to die since they're from the future.

I was genuinely touched by many of the moments, and sci-fi is my very favorite genre. Ending was admittedly a little overdone but oh well.

I don't understand why some critics are thinking to much into it. One of the main criticisms i keep seeing is that Chris Pratt in the future jumps to save his grown up daughter and a lot of people are saying why is he trying to save her if he's going to stop the war anyway in the past. Well I would think as a parent he wanted to save his child and any logic would go out the window in that moment which is understandable as it's his kid and he doesn't want her to die in the middle of the world ending. It's fight or flight. If you don't over think the movie and pick at every detail you will love it as it's a great film which keeps you glued to the screen with lots of brilliant action and thrill and humour!

2115,marqstacy,Fun movie - plot hole is PAINFUL,6,19 July 2021,"Spoilers - Majority of the movie is focused on Dan bringing back a toxin, from 30 years in the future, that will kill all the aliens. Then we can mass produce the toxin and kill all the aliens when they arrive in the future. Aliens over ran the last base in the future and the time portal collapses as he goes back through. He arrives to a world in chaos, cities on fire, UN disbanded - human civilisation is collapsing under the belief we're doomed. But... He was SUCCESSFUL. Now we can win. Totally and utterly ignored in the plot. THEN, Dan and a scientist figure out the alien ship has been on Earth all along. Go to the ice, find the ship, want to blow it up. All well and good. But NO ONE takes any pics or videos of the alien craft or aliens while they are inside. How could scientists explore an ALIEN vessel that crash landed with taking any documentation at all. I don't know why, but it bugged the living crap out of me. These aliens prob still exist, they might come again, we should learn all we can, recording this would be invaluable. Also... couldnt he have just accidently broke the vial to tie up the other plot hole. BUT, all that considered, i actually like this considered, it was entertaining but could havd been sooooo much better had they tied up thaf ludricious plot hole with the toxin. He literally told his adult daughter ""you saved the world"" , then she plunged to her death but it was all worth it because of the toxin!

The volume adjustment alone was amateurish.Acting was top notch. Wont net anyone an Oscar, but these type of movies never do.Main plot was about a 6. The side plot, while familiar, helped up the score to a 7.But the real winner here is honestly the person/team who designed the monsters.And I'm talking about everything from : Look, sound, to movement. The first time the protagonist has an up close encounter, it's both amazing and mildly terrifying. It isn't a horror movie, but could easily have been designed to be.At one point I started wondering if it would be possible to set up a Alien vs ""These monsters"" movie.Then they actually ""borrow"" a pretty huge plot point from the Alien franchise... But lets not dwell on that.There was a point in the movie I was fairly certain it was about to end.And it would have worked. But they went the extra step to let us see how everything turns out.

If a quality story is your overriding interest, you should look elsewhere, because The Tomorrow War doesn't really have one.What it does have is time travel paradox, awesome action, great special effects, cool stunts, killer cinematography, an everyman hero, and the most creative monsters I've seen in a while. It even takes a stab at character development, and deals with father-daughter and father-son relationships in a way a lot of people can probably relate to.I think truly entertaining movies are pretty few and far between, so I was pleased to see this.

A) Keep all you research and materials in a lab in the future?B) At least send backups of the research on the WEEKLY trips to the past.C) Send most of the research materials and notes into the past to have everything ready for when the aliens show upFYI: They already HAVE a toxin that kills all the males of the species but haven't shared that recipe yet.Etc.",The Tomorrow War
2148,vexted,Easy to like this movie,8,7 July 2021,"This movie has a lot of things going on, but at its heart it asks how far would you go for your family. The human race has already gone to war to stop all sorts of evil despots through out history, would we do any less against aliens. So in a nutshell that's the story except the hook is the war is in the future and they need people from the past to fight because they're losing the war.Now the premise is a fresh take on the usual time travel movie in that they ask us to go forward to fight the aliens. Chris Pratt's character has a nice life not perfect. His only broken relationship is with his father wonderfully played by J K Simmons. Now while the film has flaws as do most, I liked the journey these characters took me on. They pull you in and you care about the outcome as good characters do. I guess the ending of most movies, sometimes before the introduction of most of the cast. So for me a good movie is the ride I take with the main characters that makes a movie A above average and B a movie I'd watch again or even add to my collection. This movie has A B & C going for it.To start with the characters are enjoyable. They could have fleshed them out a little more but you can make that argument about most films. The story is an interesting concept and I'd honestly love to see this as a mini series or a limited series. The pacing is good not great it seems rushed at times (remember I thought this would make a great mini series). The special effects and camera work are on par with your average SyFy outing these days. The aliens are relentless and menacing.Now my one spoiler and the only thing that I didn't like about the film (stop reading here)Perhaps the only thing that I can say I didn't like about this film was the conscription aspect. I get the draft arguments with every war. I just think the lack of training and preparation shown in the movie is laughable or ugly take your pick. If it's us or them everything's on the line I don't need you to March but I damn we'll need you to understand battlefield tactics. Again really good movie 8 out of 10. Peace out.",The Tomorrow War

I have to blast my tv to hear what they are saying while the background sound is loud. Better be ready for CC. Why is there so much dialogue? You could cut a 1/2 hour out of the movie to make it better. Why is there only one scientist/Muri working on the toxin? ""It's a one person job.."" Why isn't the toxin not studied the moment they return with it? All of a sudden the world just gives up why they return with the toxin? ""Ahh the world is over. We can't do anything anymore...every country hates each other, ahh it's all over."" Why don't they inject the toxin into the female alien when they find the spaceship rather than the males? Why are they turning to a high school student about volcanos when there are X amount of scientists with stronger intelligence? Why is the father upset when his daughter dies in the future when he has the toxin that can stop the war before the war starts that will stop the daughter from dying in the future? What did I just say...my hurts typing that. Why is the father not getting the job at the beginning of the movie relevant? Why isn't the alien ""mother"" not captured from the start to find the toxin that can stop the war? How are 4 soldiers capable of capturing the ""mother"" to do so? They could have found and captured the alien mother with ""4 soldiers"" from the beginning. Why do they need a toxin when you can just kill the mother with an axe? Why can't Muri just tell him what happened about him leaving her in the past? ""The less you know the better.."" ""I'll tell you at the right time.."". Why does the army not tell the soldiers about how the aliens' backs are bullet proof? Why do I never see any of the soldiers reloading their weapons? 20 round mag seems to hold 1,000 shells? Why are the soldiers not trained much sooner after drafted and set into the future? ""You don't even want to see what the aliens look like. They are really, really scary.."" Wouldn't that kind of being important to see? So you know where to shoot them? 7 days before they are sent into the future they have zero experience in military operations. Who wants a 60 year old or any one with zero military experience with an automatic firearm in the groups? No wonder only 20% return from the war. If they can tell the exact time a person will die, they don't use it to there advantage? Why, why, why?!? I have a handful of other questions. This a poor script. Drags with dialogue. It was painful to watch. I'm pretty sure this movie killed more brain cells than the beers I was drinking. You may actually get more villains to talk by using this movie as a form a torture.

2152,johnmars-62771,SciFi for stupid people,3,4 July 2021,"I tried to enjoy this movie, but there are just too many things:a) Cliche city. Every cliche that you can think of is in this movie. Bad father, angry child, kills daughter in alternate timeline etc. Also, why is everybody a wiz? Hero is teacher and soldier and scientist and hand to hand master, and and. His father is not only a deadbeat, anarchist, and criminal, but also an electrical engineer, pilot and sniper. His daughter is a military leader and research scientist? Even one of his school students is an expert on volcanoes.B) Stupid writing. And I mean really stupid writing. Why would you do research in the future when you can do it in the past and have 30 years to work on the problem? Why would you send untrained people to fight super aliens? And after years of fighting give them small caliber guns that don't work? Why would you take the uncontrollable monster back into the lab, surely there is a pit somewhere far away? Why would the government not be interested in the cure? Why trying to get the high ground on snowmobiles when you literally have an airplane? How come the aliens aren't frozen after 1000s of years in the ice? Unkillable monsters, yet out hero takes one out with a left hook and a talon?Too much forced drama that feels fake. It is not enough that hero has drama with father, of course he has drama with his daughter as well, and future divorce and future death. Jeeeez.",The Tomorrow War

2156,izzschmed,Huge disappointment,3,5 July 2021,"2 characters are relatable, Chris pratt and his (Young) daughter. Literally everyone else is absolutely without any substance. Ppl Die and you dont give a damn because you dont get to know them at all.Useless dialogues, even characters (e.g. Charly) are completely misplaced and implausible. Bad jokes everywhere in worst possible situations.The story has a nice setting but is torn apart by bad directing in basically every scene. Nothing makes sense, even for a scifi movie.But the one really scary Thing is that ive never even thought about a bad soundtrack.. Only good Soundtracks. I guess if its not absolutely BOTCH, you dont notice it at all. Anyone could fetch some no copyright sounds an Youtube in 15minutes to put together a far better soundtrack than this. On top of that, you get epic battle music when ppl sneak around buildings and its supposed to be exciting in tension. I think its the worst soundtrack ive ever Heard and witnessed.It is so embarassing that anyone Puts together this construct of FAIL which does not work out in 2 hours! 2 hours and all characters are superficially displayed.To be honest, whoever votes more than 5 here has not seen anything before or is just warped by covid productions.Really, avoid this 2 hours waste of time if youre looking for a movie that does Not insult your intellect.",The Tomorrow War

War of the worlds, Die Hard (you'll know it when you see it), Predator, Jurassic Park World, World War Z not to mention the obvious literature rip offs from the forever wars etc. The plot is full of holes some scenes have been trimmed so they dont quite make sense sometimes.But, and it's a big but, it is actually really good fun, its well produced, the acting is pure blockbuster material, special effects are good. It's an entertaining two hours. Classic Father Son redemption, Father Daughter redemption monster movie.I suppose its standard hollywood now though, but pretty much every character that isnt related to the Chriss Pratt character is black. Which just felt a bit forced. Loved the guy from Veep, though it did feel like he was playing a very similar character to that from Veep.

They build up the movie fairly well with the characters, telling their stories and so on. Some of the dialogue felt a bit dull but it was alright.The ending is what threw me off because it didn't make sense. An entire world army can't tackle these monsters but a very small unit decides it is enough to tackle them in the end? They could've put more effort in creating a more intelligent storyline because the basic idea of the movie was actually interesting. I don't have issues with their approach to time-travel but they take all the effort to make a ""bio weapon"" and in the end the weapon is barely used.

However it's hard to say any character had an arch. It's pretty much exactly the movie you think it will be, but with some really good scenes and modern writing to keep it interesting.The movie itself knew it was cheesy, calling itself out at times for typical movie scenes/sequences, which was funny.

Been a big fan of Yvonne Strahovski since the series ""Chuck"" and thought she was good here as well.But I tend to have issues with movies that have no logical foundation, and this is one of those. One of the stupidest time-travel foundations ever, incredibly moronic science and scientists, and some of the more pathetic military strategies ever used in a movie. I mean here are aliens that shoot claw bullets that in one scene knock someone 20 feet off the ground, and in the next scene are stopped by drywall. And apparently they can send weapons and people into the future, and choose to send old people with automatic rifles - they might as well send puppies with water pistols.I just wish there was some logic.

Other reviewers have pointed out all of the obvious issues and its a shame after creating a film with a good cast and production values.Having thought about it for 2 seconds here are some recommended fixes.1. The future people bring back to the present all of their research people and advanced technology to get a head start on solving problem.2.

Seriously, I thought the aliens in the future are tricking the people from the present to send troops to kill easily, so they don't have to kill them all at once, they kill them from the past before even knowing what happens. But no, it is that plain stupid.So, they have 30 years to find a solution and all they can think of is to ask for soldiers, which are not even trained. Oh, and the weapons... simple guns. I think this movie must have been some kind of a joke from the writers, they couldn't have been serious in believing this non-logic could stand. Must be a parody, or a bet.Now to fix this, look at Stargate, there was an episode in which the team managed to send ONE PIECE OF PAPER back from the future and that was it. Really, one piece of paper.In this movie, to solve it, there would be GPS coordinates and the point in time, along with instructions about what kind of a bomb to drop there.I don't know, if this was not a joke, then it is really bad, just thinking what they must be thinking of us giving such movies, such stupidity is insulting.Idiocracy was so right, we are heading there...",The Tomorrow War

They have tech that can show the alien's location on a computer screen but they can't shoot them from long range? High caliber weapons do in fact work, but... where are the tanks and armored vehicles?? They have F-22 fighter jets so clearly they have a protected airfield/base but they can't organize enough to have a battle front/line?

Then once they travel to the future it all goes downhill and it is a slow and painful death. I don't mind turning my brain off for a movie like that but there was too many plot holes in the 2nd half for it to be more than mildly enjoyable. It was not to a point where i would roll my eyes every minutes but enough so that my brain would always want to come back online despite me telling him to stay closed for the night. I wont spoil anything in this review but let's just say many things don't make any sense in the and half and there are many ""omg they are dumb"" moments.

The story was decent, though, as always, the concept of time travel raises more questions than it answers. But, hey, if Marvel couldn't even get it right, who else will? The CGI was somewhat disappointing, and could have possibly be attributed to a lower budget? Some of the dialogue was laughably klunky as well. The use of suspense and action was all pretty well done. The dynamic between Pratt and Stravohski was pretty good, and the twist was somewhat unexpected.

2214,bigoo-38622,Silly But Enjoyable,7,21 September 2021,"On paper it sounds like a really good premise
the execution however could have been done better, the pacing is a little bit off
nevertheless tho the movie was quite enjoyable
it was a simple movie that one simple purpose which is to be entertaining
it didn't touch on any bigger ""messages"" nor did had some ""varied"" characters yelling at people and telling them to do better
the movie is just here to have fun and I respect that
it isn't gonna win any oscars but honestly, I would definitely choose a simple dumb movie over a a woke one that's pushing Agendas for the sake of pushing Agendas
Chris Pratt's acting was decent, J. K. Simmons was J. K. Simmons,
and Yvonne Strahovski is quite a good actress surprisingly
like she would definitely make a ,not just better, but actually a likable Captain Marvel for example
rather than... you know
the movie itself has a lot of similar elements to plenty of well known movies (Aliens, Starship troopers, Back to the Future, Edge of Tomorrow) but is somehow manages to pull up this Frankenstein of concepts and creates a pretty enjoyable ,flawed but enjoyable, plot
and damn, the movie dares to portray fathers in a positive light as caring and self-sacrificing protectors rather than useless pathetic deadbeats who need to be shown the way by their strong female counterparts
no wonder the media hated this movie...",The Tomorrow War

The script is the worst part, and casting didn't do a good job choosing the right peeps for the poorly written characters, or maybe it was the directors fault for under-directing the actors. Either way, a meh movie.The only good scene was when they were falling through the sky after getting transported to the future for the first time, well shot and edited with chilling visual effects!Alien design was disappointing.

I expected hardcore action from the movie and that's what I got! Almost all sci-fi movies are make believe. As if edge of tomorrow many people are comparing it with isn't make believe! ALIENS DO NOT EXIST! (As for now) The cast was amazing, the acting was good, there were few weird dialogues here and there. The CGI was just amazing. The aliens in the movie have to be the most creepiest creatures I've ever seen in an Alien invasion movie. There are some plot holes which don't make sense but you just have to go with the flow and enjoy the movie, the action, the CGI, the acting etc.This movie has to be in the list of Independence day, Battle Los Angeles & edge of tomorrow in terms of action.",The Tomorrow War

Its like a child that made an action story in there freetime. The story isnt worked out what leaves a missarbale movie that is not watchable if you have a fungible head.

From the trailer I thought it was gonna be a lot of time travel and going back and forth almost like edge of tomorrow but it was actually a good story! With Pratt isn't wasn't as comical as I wanted to be but for it to be PG13 the.it was pretty violent and the action was really good! Pratt and Simmons as father and son were very compatible and adding some of the family drama with the global invasion was well written! Overall definitely worth a Watch!,The Tomorrow War

Chris Pratt gave the worst performance in the film, acting like he was there more for the paycheque. Which is a shame given he is the lead and so he has the most screen time.The pacing of the movie is all over the place. I hate it when movies show a big world changing event only to immediately do a large time jump forward. We start off feeling just as shocked as the people in the movie only to jump forward 12 months, and the event is now old news to everyone. Leaving us as the viewer with no resolution to those feelings.The last act of the movie seems incredibly rushed as well, almost like it could have been the plan for a sequel but instead they slammed it into this movie.The best part about the film is the CG which is incredible and very well done. My hat is off to the animators.All in all it kept my attention for the runtime but it won't be something I remember for too long or think about often.",The Tomorrow War
2235,deepirwin,In short... Disappointing,5,7 July 2021,"The CGI is great! The action is really good at some points. The story?? The story?? It's really bad and predictable. It's a big disappointment in the name of sci-fi time travel movie. There's no logic in the movie. The plot is predictable from beginning to end. Believe me, you will be disappointed by yourself that the movie bought down your logic to so low that you can actually predict the plot in harmony with that stupidity. If you are really desperate to get disappointed with a time travel sci-fi movie then go for it. If you just wanna watch something just for the sake of good action and Passing the time, then go for it. If you are hoping to have sone logical movie and amazing story, then completely avoid it.

1. Who edited this movie? It jumps from scenes too abruptly, and the music does not help. It's like you can not immerse yourself in the movie because the scenes do not flow in a way that makes it enjoyable. I don't know how to explain it ... there is no good symbiosis between the action packed scenes and the emotional bonding ones. And the music follows this chaos.2. One scene blew everything for me. It's absurd but i can pinpoint exactly when all of this turned into trash.SPOILERS AHEAD

Not only is this very wholesome, but it has a ton of positive aspects that I adore and would love to see more of. Very happy that it's also not woke.Is it perfect though?

How does worldwide panic and riots set in when the threat will not appear for at least 25 years?The world had 25 years to prepare for the release of the aliens. It was totally preposterous to go into a blind, stupid panic about a situation that would not become an issue for at least 25 years.Really, really sad that the writers could have come up with this completely inane ending.

Thus sitting to this movie was carrying a handicap of thought: ""What the guy from Parks and Recreation, after talking to racoon and tree, done again?""Plot - good but no surprises. Dont watch it if you are grandfather paradox or Predestination fan as main success comes from timeline that would not exist. As for execution of the plot - fair but simple. Tons of CGI which are precisely rendered, but overflowing the screen, sometimes without a single spot to put eyes on. Little bit shallow on the key moments - like PTSD vets returning to their timeline and ""just the next day"" it's same old business like going out for a milk.A good family movie, without (expected) lots of gore (green blood !) that you can use as a substitute for ""Home Alone"" or ""Teletubies"".",The Tomorrow War

You have to watch it twice to catch all the hints at the beginning of the movie. Like Chris Pratt, who has comedic timing when there's action all around him.I like 'Charlie' character. He was always nervous but helped in the comedic moments of the movie.The aliens in the movie are things of nightmares and had me scared at times. The end is a bit gory, for the alien.

a few plot holes, and that the plot itself was unrealistic in places. (Civilians with no training called to save the world etc)

2301,countrymusicgirl2892,A Fun Ride Despite Its Flaws *SPOILERS*,7,12 July 2021,"Make no mistake, this movie is not the pinnacle of scientific accuracy or even logic for that matter. There are things in it that make sense, and then there are other things and leaps in logic that just don't.But the movie makes us aware of that within the first minute. The movie opens by quite literally dropping us into the action from the pov of the main character, who falls hundreds feet into the rooftop pool of a building in Miami Beach. Real world physics --for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction-- dictates that a fall of that nature would be much like falling on concrete.That's the kind of movie it is, but that's okay. For one thing, the main character is actually a science teacher. Granted, at this point in the movie, the viewer is not aware of that, but once they become aware of that, the irony can be appreciated. But the core of this movie is not the science, nor its accuracy, so don't dwell on that because the core the movie is family and second chances.That being said, the movie does not take itself too seriously by heaping on the melodrama. There are its serious moments, but then there are also moments of comic relief, but those moments are not over powering.There is plenty of action. Once it starts, you're in for the ride, and while you get some brief respite from the action, it starts back up just as quickly as it ended.The writing is not the worst, but it's not the best. At times, it does feel at times like a young adolescent could've written it, or a fanfiction writer, but when you've got Twilight/50 Shades of Grey/365 Days fanfiction out there, this is a doggone masterpiece.(No offense fanfiction writers. I too am a nerd and have written Star Trek fanfictions. I just give Twilight/50 Shades of Grey/365 Days and similar fanfics a wide berth.)I honestly don't remember the score. However, that's not to say that some of it didn't stick with me. I absolutely love the score featured during the attack on the Deepswell research facility. It is beautiful and poignant.Although the movie certainly has its flaws, it's a fun ride, and quite entertaining. Just turn off that side of your brain that wants to nitpick at the things that don't make sense or go in expecting an Oscar nominee and you'll have a good time.",The Tomorrow War

It was terrible. There was no logic to the incoherent, barely thought-out plot and the tone shifted wildly from scene to scene. It felt like three different films that had been amalgamated into one horrible concoction; art by committee.I think this will be the film that finally breaks the cycle of me getting excited for big-budget Hollywood sci-fi films only to be let down again and again with the senseless, brain-dead drivel they continue to churn out.",The Tomorrow War

Really? Have you heard of snipers? Drones? Tanks? For crying out loud, even medieval knights and longbowmen would massacre these ridiculous things.Ok, suspend disbelief on that one. You go back to the past and instead of telling people where the threat started, so we can wipe it out at the very beginning, you send to the future untrained soldiers to get massacred. How, who, WHY?The main story arc is so ridiculous, that the film needs excruciating digressions into father-child melodrama, to fill the time in a way they thought would add some kind of depth to it. Well, it doesn't, because it leads to more ridiculous plot elements, such as choosing a freaking high school teacher to assume responsibility for a scientific solution to the menace, just because he's daddy.I love sci-fi, so I managed to stick with this heap of trash for about an hour, hoping to see an inkling of interesting ideas.

The acting was good, the CGI was great but the script was utterly stupid. The key to good science fiction is the science. If things don't make sense it is impossible (for me) to enjoy watching.Putting the paradox of time travel to one side (never let it be said that I don't suspend disbelief) there are too many dumb errors. Here are the top ones for me:1. Why is Miami still there? We saw one of the kids display an ice melt graph showing that ALL the polar ice melted. So how is it that Miami is still above water in 2051? Stupid2. All the main characters remain miraculously alive, even though they might die in the future they were alive in the past. The only main character who dies was the guy who had cancer. Three tours of duty in the future and they still can't do anything for his cancer? Stupid.3. Why teleport back to 2020? Ok, I am still willing to accept the 'two rafts in a stream"" explanation, but they brought the future tech with them. Why not go back to 1950 and give themselves 100 years to prepare? Stupid. In fact, why fight the war in the future at all? Double stupid.4. The people in the future all assume that the aliens somehow landed without being detected. These are aliens without any obvious signs of higher intelligence. So no one asked how these (basically alien zombies) managed to land, undetected. No scientist in the future postulated the theory that maybe they came from somewhere else? No. It took our plucky band of misfits to figure that one out. People in the future are stupid.Thirty years in the future they will still have the same guns, vehicles and flat screen monitors as we have today. See?

2349,headbangingfilms,A film about the importance of fatherhood,9,5 July 2021,"I'll freely admit that i'm a massive fan of Yvonne Strahovski and I've been following her career since she was on the TV show Chuck. This was a fantastic movie, I came in with high expectations, but I'd been told this was a popcorn movie, with very little depth. I don't know where people got that impression, the emotional depth this film exhibited in the second act was powerful. Two people struggling to deal with fathers who disappointed them in their past; two people desperately wanting to love and forgive their father, what could be more powerful than that? Yvonne's final moments, on that burning platform, where she knows she's going to die, was one of the most rewarding emotional payoffs I've seen in a film in a very long time. His grief over having to leave his daughter behind, knowing what a wonderful person she grows up to become is such a powerful moment. The script for this film was solid, the action was fantastic, the creature design was some of the best I've seen in years. The White Spikes are a brilliant design. Larry Fong's cinematography was superb, the atmosphere throughout this movie was filled with dread and fear, but not overly so. Lorne Balfe turned in a typically superb musical score, that accentuated the action and elevated the devastating emotional moments. The entire time travel plot line was brilliantly executed in this film; they sidestepped the paradoxical nature of two beings occupying the same moment in time, by ensuring that the only people traveling BACK the 2022, hadn't been born yet. At the same time, the only people being drafted to travel to the future were people who wouldn't be alive in 2051 according to the people from the future's records. That is a brilliant plot device and one of the most unique ways of dealing wth time travel I have seen in a long, long time. I am so pleased with this film, and am so glad to see a film talking about a topic as important as fatherhood. No topic is talked about less these days than the importance of fatherhood, so i'm glad to see a movie tackle that topic. I would gladly recommend this movie to everyone and anyone, such a wonderful blockbuster.Final takeaways...1. This film featured a stunningly deep, emotional subplot, that was very powerful.2. Yvonne Strahovski shines in her role in this film and is the emotional heartbeat of this film. She deserves more leading roles in major motion pictures.3. The execution of the time travel plot was brilliantly executed.",The Tomorrow War

Lots of action, good effects and some not so bad acting, also some not so good acting too but you have to wonder if that is down to what the actors were left to work with.It does deal with a subject which is difficult to get right and usually ends up in big debates but it didn't even seem to put any effort into trying at all. I still had a titbit of hope right up until the credits began to roll that the film might salvage something though.Like a lot of films I have seen recently it is disappointing the most because it had nearly all of the ingredients to make a very enjoyable and satisfying watch. In the end though it always seems to come down to a badly thought out plot, gone are the days where films seemed to start first with a good story then the rest added in afterwards.So, don't expect too much.One minor gripe, and I know I am being picky, but if its cold at least try and make it look cold consistently.",The Tomorrow War

2371,bbirdman21,Best Post-Covid Blockbuster,7,9 July 2021,"Chris McKay's 'The Tomorrow War' is the kind of sci-fi action blockbuster that is no longer made in Hollywood. It is frequently cheesy, at times cringe, but tells a scarcely standalone story in a well-structured narrative that keeps the action refreshing and you, the audience, guessing till the end. It is tragic that we can only experience it on our 4K televisions (you should have one to fully appreciate its visual appeal, much credit to Larry Fong's magnificent cinematography) than be amazed by the IMAX experience, for it is straight off the biggest blockbuster we have had in the post-Covid period.Chris Pratt largely impresses. He is terrific as the action hero but takes some time to settle in during the dramatic moments. The first twist is quite responsible for us to get invested in his character's fate and the film gets twice more engaging from thereon.Yvonne Strzechowski is the highlight among the rest of the cast. Her character brings the pathos to the story, increasing stakes for the action that follows, and gives a memorable performance.Lorne Balfe's score is, per usual, entertaining for such massive entertainers and keeps the momentum pulsating. The alien creatures, too, are far from generic and well thought. Any comparisons to 'Edge of Tomorrow' or relative alien-invasion flicks is inappropriate.",The Tomorrow War

Is it Close Encounters or classic Star Wars good no... But it sits on the level of movies like Predator, Aliens, in that action packed fun summer blockbuster way!The plot is solid albeit a few predictable moments. If you know anything about plot development in movies and creating tension and tie in with later parts of the story you can pretty much guess what's going to happen. But that doesn't take away from the fun and the excitement of the movie.On the production side the CGI and effects are all top notch, the sound design was really good. No massive volume spikes when action stars and no super quiet dialogue that you have to constantly keep reaching for the remote.Personally I feel they could have developed the ending a bit more, but this movie definitely has some of the feels in there to get you a little choked up in spots.

And the ridiculous rogue mission with no interaction from the government.Wasted wasted wasted potential.,The Tomorrow War
2399,Grimrikk,Chewing gum for the eye's -,7,19 July 2021,"I quite liked the concept for this film, it had some interesting ideas but was undone by a third act that was a bit... silly.What I couldn't believe was that after he comes back with the toxin that would end the war, the government just says, nope, there's nothing we can do now that the machine is broken. That is of course after they had sent thousands upon thousands of people to their death through forced drafting. I know the time machine thing was broken, but the toxin could've been prepared so that when the time came it would've made easy work of the coming war, I mean, it's not like they didn't know it was coming in 20-30 years time - and after wasting all those lives you'd think they would at least entertain the idea.After they're back a new mission is launched (unofficially) by a few individuals to find the initial invasion point in the current time, a very underprepared mission might I add - one which could've lead to an earlier war than planned, and with not enough toxin prepared to even do anything meaningful about it. It goes to plan, somehow... but then the official that shut everything down when Pratt comes back takes credit for it all, so that's probably quite accurate with politicians, but still a bit annoying.Overall, I did like the design of the aliens, they were done very well and didn't look like obvious CGI creatures. The sound design was decent, and the twist with Muri was also pretty cool. It was a fun couple hours while watching it and I didn't end up browsing the web halfway through, which I tend to do if a movie bores me so that's usually a win for me. The cast was also quite enjoyable, and think that the people who worked on the film did a good job - the writers dropped the ball a bit though, the ending should've been thought through a bit more.As I said in the title, it was good chewing gum for the eyes, keeps you occupied but doesn't break any new grounds.",The Tomorrow War
2400,danncer-74330,"First half rates a 7, second half rates a 4.",6,7 July 2021,"I really enjoyed the first half of this movie. There was good character development and a compelling premise if you just accepted the time travel element without worrying about the science. There were even a couple of smart plot points, like only taking those who are no longer alive in the future timeline. Just don't think too hard about how the deaths of soldiers from the present would impact the future.As much as I enjoyed the first half, I was so disappointed by the second half. Although there were a few instances in the first half where the characters seemed to lose all common sense, in the second half the short-sightedness of the characters became chronic. Why would Dan (Chris Pratt's character) not immediately tell the military scientists about the toxin? The scene with the Secretary of Defense was laughable as was the decision to take only a small group to destroy the aliens and have them go in and just start poisoning the first whitespikes they see rather than doing some reconnaissance to find the female and kill her first. Of course, if the characters in the second half had used any common sense (other than figuring out where the aliens were and when/how they got there), then Dan and his tiny group couldn't have saved the day all by themselves and without taking any credit for their heroism.The second half of the movie could have been really good with a more logical plot. I'm not a creative writer, but even I could come up with a better storyline that would still have action, drama, and plenty of CGI. It feels like the action sequences and CGI had been planned out beforehand, and the writers were told to move the characters from point A to point B to point C as quickly as possible without worrying about the quality of the story.

Watch something else.The film basically sees people being transported to the future to fight an alien war that we're losing if we don't send reinforcements from our current timeline.Once that premise is laid the whole film starts falling apart. We send reinforcements with no training, no armour, not even basic knowledge of what they're facing. Despite literally having decades to ready people. Instead they get transported into the future 24 hours after enrolling with just a gun and a mic.The only way to kill the aliens with a gun is to shoot them in the neck or the belly. Otherwise a gun is useless. And they don't even give the recruits this basic knowledge before sending them?! Imagine sending millions into a war with a weapon that only works on two very specific places, knowing this before you send people and not bothering to tell them. No wonder we're losing this war?!It boils down to 80-90% of the movie spent looking for a toxin to kill the aliens with. They decide to use the toxin to kill the aliens in the present. The main characters wife and a school boy figure out where and when the aliens are in the present in about 3 minutes, despite nobody on the planet including the main characters daughter who has her bloated CV and education fronted during the movie. Being able to figure this information out in years?!Yet on finding the alien outbreak in hibernation before it spread, using the toxin only made the whole thing worse! They kill 6 aliens with the toxin you spend nearly 2 hours working towards and blow the other thousand or so up with a bit of C4!?Literally if they never found and used the toxin and just placed some C4 and blew them up, they'd of had a nice day out in the snow without the drama?!The film destroys its own arch and resolution.Wouldn't recommend to anyone that requires a basic level of intelligence in their storytelling.",The Tomorrow War

So i felt i should comment this.The movie itself was absolutely ok to watch. Its a fantasy flick, not even remotely a sci-fi movie just because someone mumbles ""science"" and they used time-travel .... they could have just as well simply let some sorcerers do the ""magic"". I wouldn´t call out any plotholes cause the didn´t even tried to connect some logical strings.Watch it as a fantasy flick and you most probably will be satisfied. If Tenet was too exhausting to watch, this is the exact opposite ... cliche filled popcorn without reason or intellect.

Unfortunately, only 30% survive their tour of duty. A worldwide draft is put into effect, and ordinary citizens are recruited to fight in the tomorrow war of 2052.

After a drop in Miami gone awry, he meets his adult daughter, Muri Forester in 2052. She is a Colonel and the lead scientist working on bio research developing a toxin to destroy the whitespikes. She succeeds and sends the toxin back to 2022 with her father, Dan. Afterward, the wormhole connecting 2022 and 2052 is completely severed. Dan and his team discover the whitespikes' ship had been on Earth all along, buried in an ice glacier I n Russia.

Yet half the way they are doing the opposite of changing the future.Another eye sore is the weapon. 30 years from today and they still shoot 556 that is very inefficient. It reminds me of the Starship trooper where light speed traveling is combined with 556 as well.It was not shown in the movie how the alien can organize and communicate on a global scale.True, any space traveling aliens would erase human at ease, but need to have a good logical story to tell that.Disappointed.",The Tomorrow War

Boss fight part 2 (once all skill and weapon upgrades have been collected) check... and even at a slightly too long running time bogged down by sometimes unnecessary emotional melodrama, it is still good entertainment.The aliens although lacking in personality are menacing, especially in one, from the alien's perspective, ""this time it's personal"" set piece.

2455,ausweichsebbo,Utterly dumb movie,1,9 July 2021,"I've never written a review before but after watching this movie I just had to.No amount of CGI can make up that stupid nonesense of a plot. I did not except much from this movie beforehand but it managed to get even worse.Poor story, one-dimensional characters.There's an alien invasion in the future and the only solution mankind comes up with is sending untrained civilians that don't even know how to load a gun into the future.Half of them die on impact, the other half mysteriously survive falling 500ft from the sky into a shallow pool on a rooftop.They manage to secure some samples from a laboratory by having unlimited ammo.After that, they do some research on a female alien only to be completely destroyed by a horde of male aliens. Chris Pratt's daughter, a military biologist in the future, is able to find a toxin that could potentially kill all aliens.However, Chris Pratt almost kills himself in a stupid act of trying to save his daughter because he clearly does not understand the logic of time travel.If he can go back in time with the toxin, the war would likely never start and his daughter would never die anyways.The soldiers come back from future with a possible solution to everything and are told that government don't want to spend roughly 5,000$ of ""tax payers money"" for a flight to Russia when they've already spend billions of dollars to make time travel possible in the first place.Why Russia? They have asked a 15 year old boy from high school who is interested in volcanos and he came up with the solution to end all of this in a matter of seconds.Now that they know the possible location of the aliens AND have a toxin to potentially kill all of them 30 years before the war even starts, they surely would wait and think this through for a couple of years right? Nope.They just stupidly break into the alien ship, mess everything up completely, kill about three aliens with the toxin, only to blow up the whole ship before hell breaks loose and they're very close to waking up all of the aliens in the presence.If this was enough already, Chris Pratt uppercuts the last female alien in a hand to hand combat to finally kill it.I can understand how you give this a 6/10 if you can shut off your brain completely while watching this movie. Everyone giving this a 8, 9 or 10 is completely crazy or has never ever watched an actual good movie before.",The Tomorrow War

The script is at times clunky and the humour while genuinely funny at times just doesn't always fit, as we all know timing is the secret of good gags. The action is pretty standard and generally well done but for some reason goes from intense and believable to actually frankly ridiculous in parts and it does spoil the flow of the action.

I was happily surprised to find the first third of the movie super engaging and interesting. For me, the concept really worked and had me on board from the start. The middle portion was very action heavy and had a little too much CGI than I would have liked. I would also say the CGI itself wasn't that great and noticibly had some issues as I watched that took me out of it. It's a shame because I thought the Alien design was actually really cool. At one point it feels like the movie comes full circle right to a perfectly timed conclusion where the hero learns a lesson, makes some sacrifices, and saves the day.BUTThen there's another 35min of pretty much pointless action scenes that really feel out of line with the rest of the film. It adds some different story elements that really weren't necessary to the plot and end up causing more questions than answers.Overall it was entertaining and I'm glad I watched it, but I definitely am disappointed the way it ended because I really think I would have enjoyed it more had it taken the natural conclusion instead of creating it's own.",The Tomorrow War

Parts of the plot seem to be cut short... for example why from what we see Chris Pratt's character like as a father are we supposed to believe he would just leave his daughter and wife? That was my first issue and then as others have stated if he brings the virus back and kills the aliens why is he so upset about his daughter dying when he knows he can stop it.

A man who is drafted into an army from the future (2051) where a war is taking place against an alien breed which the humans are losing. So people from the present are sent into the future to help fight the war in the future using a time travel machine. There is no logic in this film but that is what you expect from a big blockbuster movie. Chris Pratt and J. K Simmons are great in their roles and have some decent comedic chemistry together. The film contains some comedic lines which will make you laugh however the film is fairly serious for such a brianless action/adventure film but it is executed fairly ok.

2505,haiderjarif,4 star just because of action.,4,1 August 2021,"1 hour into the movie and I found 0% logic.*The world didn't modify at all. Specially weapon.*Putting people in 2052 literally doesn't make any sense because most of them will die while falling from the sky. It is also stupidity that they can't control their feelings.*The guns literally do nothing to the alien. Guns don't need any reload and Some(most) men don't even have gun magazines with them. The world is talking about laser guns and they are using conventional guns. (MPT 76 showed will have a laser with it in near future)*F-22 raptor, Blackhawk helicopter, driverless light armored vehicle, etc. The last F22 (made in 2011) will retire in 2052 and using a stealth fighter is the most illogical thing because the alien doesn't have radars. So, they need fighters with more ammunition(bomb). Why they didn't put the F35 in the movie(The so-called best fighter jet till now). They used HMMWV (light armored vehicle) and Blackhawk helicopter whereas a tank and Sikorsky Raider-X(United States Army Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft) could do great there.*For saving a man, the whole team got down.

2512,tomoculus,The Tomorrow War Today,2,7 July 2021,"SPOILERS.As long as you don't use your mind, this movie offers entertainment at least. I think other reviewers have covered the vast inconsistencies that rule this movie from beginning to end.I got lost when trying to find the microphone the time traveling harbringer of future events used to amplify her voice so a whole stadium crowd could hear her. And why suddenly appear in a football stadium. I didn't think football was that popular in America the whole nation would be watching it. They refuse to call it football!As others have noted, if there's less than 500,000 people left after the alien invasion in the future, and there's 7 billion people in the ""present day"", it means the vast majority of the population can be drafted to fight the alien invasion.You'd think that some stronger weaponry would be developed to combat such a threat. You know, like a gun that has a bit more umph to it. I don't know. It's very obvious the guns that are being used don't have much impact on the white spikes. It just seemed odd that in all that time that had passed, guns were still just guns. And bullets were still just bullets.When the aliens are found to be already on Earth in the present day, and a possible location for them, AND a method to get rid of them permanently so they pose no threat, why is it then refused to do anything about it? This is baffling. I mean, it serves a purpose in the ""rebel with a cause"" motif. But it makes no sense here. IF bureaucracy and politic prevented a public political figure from backing such an idea is understandable. But at least support the people that offer a solution that will save the world. You don't have to go public with it. But damn. The whole refusal to be involved when evidence is overwhelming that this is a viable solution to a major threat ....... it's just bad writing.Another reviewer said, a better ending would be Chris Pratt being the cause of the aliens taking over the world, inadvertently. It's got a Twilight Zone / Outer Limits irony to it, creates a time loop inescapable to get out of, and seals the fate of humankind. It doesn't make for a happy ending with lots of hugs and love, but it makes for a decent story, AND something to think about when messing with time travel, destiny, fate, and choices. It would just be the kind of movie where cliche, generalisms, repeated themes are thrown aside to actually make a GOOD movie. Does every movie have to have a happy ending? Does everyone's life have a happy ending? I understand this is escapism and entertainment, but if you're going to spend that kind of money while people are dying and starving and doing all the nasty stuff that happens while living, at least make it thought provoking and well made. At least have it say something. At least have it make you question the ideas it's presenting. Does Chris Pratt's character change upon returning to the present day, causing his death 7 years later, which provokes his daughter to do the things she does? Is it that he watches her die in the future that causes this change, a future her 9 year old self cannot see. Does Chris Pratt still die 7 years later anyway? Maybe that's his destiny to do REGARDLESS of whatever choice he makes because of the future he's seen. So is that imminent death 7 years in the future now called off? Is it null and void? Is that now off the records because he saved the world and his daughter's future? Are we going to get a sequel set 7 years from now where Chris Pratt has to avoid his own death, so that if aliens come back again, he's there for us? I mean I don't see a sequel coming from this whatsoever. But I do think we shoudl get a short film set 7 years from now where we see if Chris Pratt's character still dies anyway.",The Tomorrow War

2518,redbeardceltic,Enough with the complaints on time paradox,10,8 July 2021,"A lot of people keep complaining about time paradoxes, which sci-fi movie on time travel doesn't have paradoxes? Also, unless you are a theoretical physicist, how do you know?There are various different temporal theories in quantum mechanics. Most what people talk about are just laymen's understanding of linear time. However, in quantum mechanics, there is divergent theory, sometimes refer to as parallel universe theory, in which all events of choice and decisions do happen in alternate quantum realities.This seem to be what this movie is basing on. In this case, every time jump and return creates a new ""alternate future."" They just seem very similar because of the same alien invasion event, while choosing conscripts that already died in 30 years to minimize time pollution. However, there is a little more. Because in such theory, the future actually alters the past. If you travel to the future, can you meet yourself? No, because you were removed from the future since you traveled there. However, if you later return to the past, then your past who traveled to the future should be able to see your future self. This is a paradox.This is typically resolved by what is called a quantum tether theory. Again, it is all theoretical. In this case, it seemed to be what this movie is based on, the future and the past are tethered by the wormhole, so both past and future continues on the same quantum stream. The point of origin in this case is set in the past, so the past is always consistent, but the future changes. This is the same theory in Bill and Ted, which is why the clock in San Dimas is always ticking.In this theory, imagine sewing your ripped jeans. Past to F1, then past to F2, you always return to the same past but yet create a new quantum reality in alternate futures. You are sewing a flowery pattern. This seems to be consistent to the movie's time travel hence why Muri keeps saying ""they were never going to make it"" because no matter what they change in the past, it will only create a new alternate future. The current future will still exist because it is ""in reality"" attached to a different alternate past, but tethered to one consistent past.So Pratt's character is not a theoretical physicist and didn't understand, he wanted to go back and produce the toxin and bring it to the future, it won't work b/c this is a dramatic change which will create a very different alternate future in a quantum reality. So even if the time jump gate wasn't disrupted, he would've end up in an alternate future. Likewise, whether toxin or blowing up the alien ship, it will create a new alternate future, yet the previous future with Muri, they were still doomed.Do you understand any of this? No? Then just stop asking question and enjoy the movie.",The Tomorrow War

My only negative was there is some logic that went out the window at times but I kinda didn't really think about it in the moment because I was enjoying what was going on in the world surrounding it. My questions are how in the world did such a primitive alien species build that crazy ship haha that kinda had me like huh but whatever maybe they were smarter then what they seemed. Also why didn't they sedate the female more so she didn't wake and why did it take those things take so long to attack the main HQ. Whatever I loved the film and will definitely watch it again! The action is amazing and when you first see the aliens and they're running down the stairwell screaming you'll be like okay this is fun! Cheers to the producer, director, and actors!

Them is supposedly set some 30 years in the future. Time travel has been invented. So if super brilliant scientist have invented time travel, why weren't they smart enough to get robots and drones to battle the aliens?

2552,viljamithseason,Writing and plot are the issues.,6,15 July 2021,"Just to make sure. I enjoyed this movie a bit, but so many cringing things in it. It seems that only one person was writing this and had lacking knowledge of the world in every aspect of it and therefore huge potholes were left in this movie.My first thought when looking what this movie is about was that this must be preparation movie of sorts. You have a link to past and they have 30 years to prepare and stuff. You could send tissue samples etc. To create toxins and what not. In the past you could start training alien killers and develop weapons specifically to kill what ever is attacking us. And so I thought that this was the most effective way to prevent that future. Oh and start by sending back instructions how to build time machine if the future is changed the ability to keep the link up would still be there while the new info starts to change the future.Well this was not the case and the whole movie was a showing of the -21 CGI which was nice. And some Sci-Fi style sets with B-movie plot and character problems. It is a shame that for some reason not a single educated human was paid to go through the script in detail cause these issues could have been found and even dealt with. There were some good details like only the ones that are dead would be sent to future to fight but they should have been sent there to aid in research in the first place and to to fight hopeless war.Basic entertainment but as sci-fi enthusiast would want more much from the plot and even for my engineer brain it was right there for the grasping.6 for me is entertaining but nothing to watch again, ever because it was too simple and flawed of a plot.",The Tomorrow War

The main character conveniently has a high school student who happens to be a volcano expert and can simulate the snow melting as well as the exact phenomenon they needed to solve.Additionally, the father of the main character is a war veteran who happens to have his own airplane and can give the team a ride when the government can't (when they're fully able and were willing to incite riots by forcing draft on massive scales).Furthermore, the daughter of the main character happens to find the toxin bond agent all by themselves (no seriously, they only had her and the main character in the laboratory to do testings).Basing their hypothesis on the white spikes' location in the present time, they travel all the way to another continent and proceed to blow up a long line of ice/snow to just get 'proof' and not consider the possibility of releasing these things earlier on the world when it's already in chaos and is less united than the future counterpart.The 'jump link' that they do to send present-time soldiers and throwing their limited defense force from the skies into a highrise and letting 'scientists/researchers' fall to their death and hope they land in a pool?You can either love it or hate it, but you cannot deny the movie's writing is bad when the people who gave the good reviews are simply saying to turn off your brain and 'enjoy the action'.",The Tomorrow War

For me, I think people might have dropped their standards on movies over the year as not really many good movies are made in the past 12 months or so. I can't lie to myself and I've got to say I did not enjoy the movie at all.First of all, I have to admit the VFX and action sequences are very well-made and entertaining. Chris Pratt is great in this film and seeing J. K. Simmons on the screen again is awesome. But they are probably the only positive things I can say about this film.Here goes my problems with this film. This film feels super cringy, storyline is a mess and it feels like few episodes of a Netfilx series being put together into a movie. Almost everything in the film doesn't make sense at all. The dialogues are super corny and cringy, there are unnecessary jokes every now and then. The story is just not convincing enough to my liking to fully get myself immersed in the movie. If you've seen all the best sci-fi action films that you could find to this day, I don't think you're gonna really enjoy this one.Despite all the noticeable flaws I still hung on to the movie till the end and surprisingly the last half an hour was pretty fun. The first hour feels like it's dragging on for a little bit and the last act of the film feels like a totally different movie. I actually dug the last act of the film but I thought it was too late anyway because I almost turned my tv off. In short I don't think this is something I'd ever be watching again. A 5.5 - 6.0 is probably what I would give for this movie (6 is average for me) but I think this movie probably leans towards a 5 more than a 6 for me.",The Tomorrow War

The movie however though it was more entertaining to waste the audience's time by developing toxins which ended up becoming useless because they killed them with c4 (they did use it to kill the queen but if would just have the same impact if they used other weapons)Hopefully the sequel (or prequel) focuses more on its other options, but other than that my opinion for the tomorrow war hasn't changed.",The Tomorrow War

It concluded!It was almost 2 separate films in one. It was not trying to be clever but it had enough humour, grit, gore, intelligence to satisfy so many aspects of an entertaining 2 solid hours.

How & why is Chris Pratt in this?",1,9 July 2021,"This movie is best summed up as a combo of one of those really really bad (not even a so bad its good) Saturday late night SyFy channel movies with a poorly used large budget, an interesting cast, and somehow Chris Pratt. But the biggest here is that this movie is so insanely disjointed and it's impossible to get through a single scene without 5 new plot holes popping up. Scene to scene the story doesn't even make sense beyond aliens bad - humans good. There's a super cheesy terrible but watchable movie in there somewhere, but Jesus it's so bloated with meaninglessness it's impossible to find. I mean seriously scene after scene it DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. We can't escape them, there's thousands of aliens... next camera angle casually driving on to a beach, walking around in the sand, shooting a flare and having a lengthy convo. I can not emphasize this enough - this script is absolute garbage - and not like the writers are terrible garbage - but the kind where terrible studio execs, producers, director, etc. Probably all got involved in dumbing it down to oblivion, and when they realized how insanely bad the remaining incoherent script pages were they decided to just go full on into ripping off every movie before it. Every line of dialogue, every scene just means nothing at all. Why Chris Pratt... why are you in this? I hope whatever favor you owed was worth it.",The Tomorrow War

If you do not know anything about science, why to show your stupidity to the world instead of paying a few hundreds (thousands?) of dollars to a graduate student or a postdoc from MIT (Caltech, etc) to proof-read your script? This would be like a 0.0005% investment compared to the budget of this movie. Some students may be even happy to proof-read for free in exchange for their name in credits!This is such a shame to make such big acting, scene setting and CGI effort to produce garbage like this.

For some reason the last of humanity is in a oil rig.... I guess that in the future we still dont have bases on the moon, space, mars, and also we dont even have bunkers.To wrap it up, it have a bad plot, bad actors (except for few) and no logic what so ever.Do not recomend it l, except if there really isnt nothing to watch.",The Tomorrow War

Why not evacuate the future into the past, and then focus all efforts on building an army and arsenal capable of wiping out the aliens when they first show up?Even if they never realised the aliens were frozen in a spaceship - they know the first time and place they attacked. They could have spent the intervening decades building tanks, and bombs, and guns that do more damage.

Neither does the relentlessness of the creatures, themselves ""borrowed"" from a couple of movies or more.What really kills it is the entire 3rd act, where they venture afar to seek and destroy the root cause of the massacre.

Does it have to make complete sense? The answer to both these questions is, of course, no. It need only be entertaining and, as the name of the genre suggests, fictitious and this movie ticks both boxes.For me the plot, storyline and acting are the most impressive aspects, in particular the final act, that really worked for me.In my opinion the CGI is the only aspect that unfortunately lets it down, I can't quite put my finger on it but it felt shallow and hurried in certain scenes although I will concede that the aliens themselves were very, very good.To summarise, if you approach this film expecting perfection, you'll be disappointed but if you approach it with an open mind, like me, you'll really enjoy it.

One scene shows his future daughter telling him how he just left her and her mother when she was young, just like how he left his real life wife and prematurely-born son (Team Anna and Jack). Throughout the movie, Chris Pratt's character makes terrible decisions while leading the pack, just like his terrible decision to post an Instagram post with terrible and shady wording towards his ex-wife and son. In the movie, Chris Pratt's character got left by his father and forever felt disdain throughout most of his life. I am sure that's how Jack will feel towards Chris Pratt when he grows up.Real life aside, Chris Pratt's character jumps in after his future daughter and risked humanity even though she said he has to live and take the toxin back to save the world, forgetting his daughter is still alive in the present time!",The Tomorrow War

The look on Chris Pratt's face was really what sold the suspense in the beginning.It was great to build suspense before the reveal.I was always a little disappointed with aliens from ""quiet place"" and the one with Will Smith. Those CGI aliens are fast and deadly but too easy for any army to defeat.Sound hunting. Just put a bomb on a radio and set it to blow up on touch.Or Sniper rifle at a distance.Even these aliens whose spikes can only partially penetrate armor, just carry a shield to deflect the spikes away. Laws of physics. A blunt spike can't penetrate unless it's a perpendicular hit.Clearly they communicate. Why didn't they try tricking them with the audio. Again put a bunch of bombs on a sound source and wait for them to attack.Drafting the everyday man or woman and putting a gun in their hands was a great story line, it's not hard to pull the trigger then sending them to the wrong spot for the jump killing several before they even made it to from the 60 story drop. Great leading storyline really grabs the audience attention.I too thought they should have just blown up the ship at the end from the start, but I'm thinking they probably thought they could kill the few then save the ship. Only after realizing there were too many did they blow it up.Then it's too too late.Seems like some deleted scenes could have filled in those details.",The Tomorrow War

How did this storyline even get made into a movie?"" I am really just confused why they thought these gaping plot holes were acceptable. At first I found the dumbness of this movie to be perplexing and disturbing. Now I am just angry it was ever made. I don't know how anybody is able to enjoy a movie that could inspire so much frustration, there are very easily solvable problems. For example, what's the easiest way to get something to the future? Well, try waiting! Aside from the story that lacked common sense, it also had a political agenda of course. I would advise you not to waste your time.* I read my review and it does not do justice to just how stupid this movie is. There are not worlds to describe how little the plot made sense, I could write a paper on the plots holes in this movie.

2700,philip-dygeus,A bit entertaining. But best avoid due to the plot holes.,3,5 July 2021,"It's entertaining. I mean, it's impossible to watch Pratt without smiling. In fact, it's a bit of a drawback for him because of how he's often been typecast, like the funny can-do saviour of whatever happens to be needing saving. Any serious scene with him will therefore be lighthearted. And that's technically bad. I would have picked another actor for this movie for this reason. Myself for instance.The first half provides OK popcorn action. I liked that there were a few new aspects to time travel that at least I haven't seen before, such as vertical coordinate errors in the drop zone. Ouch.But honestly when the youngsters from the future tell current-day humanity to sacrifice their generations due to an unspecified threat that they don't even instruct them about how to kill, well then I honestly begin to wonder if the screenwriters, director and producers think we, the audience are just a bunch of morons without even half a brain.The movie is full of such offensively bad story writing.The beasts are so powerful that it wouldn't have hurt to add one line - 1 LINE - of dialogue that the stomach is the best kill spot. That instead has to come in the midst of battle by a disgruntled soldier as a casual observation. Honestly, wow. Even if world leaders would somehow - amazingly in this day and age of social media and instant sharing - have been able to hide information about the beasts and their abilities from the general public, that little piece of information would DEFINITELY have come out. And of course not only that, but everything else about them would have been shared. Twitter would have been constantly on bloody FIRE sharing information about the vicious future threat. Etc.It's also entirely inconceivable also that the governments wouldn't have pored over every surviving deployee for information about how best to kill the beasts. But nope none of that happens.Un. Fath. Om. Able. Throughout.Evidently the solution to killing these omnipotent beasts would have to lie in some form of science, like the virus in Independence Day. That was a given.But what I disliked the most was Pratt's character's inability to deal with, well, things. When he's told the stuff that will happen to his 'current' life it is evident that it must have to do with PTSD from his deployment. The second we see his daughter as Col Mary we know it's got to do with death or at least grievous bodily harm to her. That's a given. The fact that he will in all likelihood be able to return to comparably safe current day reality ought to strengthen him throughout the deployment. When he travels back to current day he, being the science geek and soldier that he is, ought to simply just get on with producing the toxin to kill the beasts.Instead the screenwriters spent unnecessary dialogue and time on dealing with his loss ignoring completely the elephant in the room which is the extremely positive thing that he, having been able to travel back before the link broke, will be able to save the future and erase the bad events from ever having to happen. So even if he's watched his daughter die, he'll actually be able to save her. He doesn't even correct one of the youngsters when she offers Pratt her condolences. She's still bloody alive dammit.Oh and then the authorities' refusal to listen to, wait for it, science when Pratt and his veteran buddies explain the new, unheard of theory they've come up with (together with a school kid, incidentally) about where the beasts came from, well inconceivable stupidity rears its ugly head once again. Sigh. Does the authority representative listen to them? No he says that things are so bad that we can't risk anything, not even flying into hostile Russia. Apparently the survival of the species isn't worth that risk. Instead let's just sit around doing the same thing over and over again and send our flesh and blood into the jaws of certain death.They say that if you keep repeating something that has been proven not to work, then it's a sign of insanity.Incidentally I'm tired of seeing yet another man oppose reason, like that authority figure does, who refuses to send the motley band to Russia. Why must it always be a man? Put an incompetent woman on display for once. There are some, you know.It is bloody annoying how screenwriters time and time again take audiences for a ride with plots that are so shockingly poorly constructed that one quietly wonders who in their right mind would ever finance such a production. It's truly embarrassing.",The Tomorrow War
2701,gangreneroof,You'll Be Glad You Gave It A Shot,9,10 July 2021,"Time travel movies are always fun, but are usually full of bad logic. Honestly this movie handles that tricky plot device better than most. Chris Pratt is always fun to watch but he's pretty serious in this one. The film makes use of a lot of ""off screen"" weapon reloads but it isn't as bad about it as other popular films. It has action, aliens, and even tackles some relationship issues...so it is hardly one dimensional.

BUT... the biology teacher has a kid in his class that really likes volcanoes... phew - day saved!I get the struggle of not wanting to see your grown daughter die but at that point your whole reason to live is to go back in time and make sure you save the human race ... which, you know, includes your daughter... Oh, and now that we have the toxin we still can't kill the queen/female alien because...just because? It's sedated and chained so you don't actually need to waste the toxin on it to kill it... just pick another method and get to it.Soldiers come from the future asking for help from an alien invasion that started in Russia.Hero comes back with toxin to kill the aliens and save the world... tells military to mass produce and go to Russia to end threat early... military asks for proof the aliens are in Russia... (huh?)Ok, now that we're in the alien spaceship with the toxin lets just inject a few and wait around for the others to wake up... but we have C4 just in case... why isn't C4 Plan A again?There are many more but those stood out to me.It's decent enough for mindless action but could have been so much more.",The Tomorrow War

We got was maybe one of the stupidest plot lines I've ever seen in my entire life. It went from being kind of funny to somewhat annoying to outright flabbergasting in the course of a half an hour.They're just so many decisions made within the movie that just make absolutely no sense. Everything about it feels like somebody just thought of an idea and ran with it and no one really thinking about what it would mean for the story at Large.Even the ending just felt super unsatisfying like they killed the aliens but according to the president whoever the fact I was the war is still ending and no One believes Chris Pratt no one's seen the monsters because they refused to show footage from the future so all they're left with is Chris pratt's word that he stopped the future war.There's a good movie in here somewhere but it just doesn't translate. Take an action scene for example pratantine find an alien down the street attacking a group of soldiers and immediately opened fire. The aliens react and start approaching as Pratt in teen move up using suppressive fire on their assault rifles that literally never run out of ammo. And then finally one gets close enough for Pratt to hit it with an ax. And while that sounds cool on paper in reality it's a 3 minute scene of 17 people shooting fully automatic rifles at one alien as it runs down the street and finally succumbs to a haymaker from our lead character. It's like they didn't think about how the scene would feel or what that means as far as how tough the aliens are because in reality they're either bullet sponges or if they're in a situation where they need to die you can just do a short burst and they fall over. It really feels like they just wrote the script without really thinking about anything that they were doing.Pass unless you are super bored.",The Tomorrow War

2717,vicewsssixteen,Definitely an above average action scifi movie,7,13 July 2021,"First things first, the plot holes are not that bad.The plot holes comes later in the movie. Before reaching those parts, the movie's introduction and setup should have given you what to expect throughout the rest of the movie:It is not trying to be a serious and thought-provoking movie. So don't.Might as well question why the characters didn't die when there's an explosion and the characters are sent flying from the shockwave.With that out of the way...The story is supposed to be simple and entertaining, a bit wacky and funny at some parts, thrilling and over the top during action scenes. It does all that very well.The visuals are just stunning. The alien design and how they define the future technology is decent. At least it doesn't try to be too futuristic and end up looking weird.The soundtrack is actually not bad. Nothing memorable but it is used nicely in some actions scenes.The suspense is legit. The actions scenes gave me goosebumps even though it is cheesy. Especially the earlier part in the future.There's drama that is fairly well integrated into the plot. The acting really does help when the scene is right. It does have one minor awkward moment before the main character leaves his home to go to the future.The pacing is just nice. It doesn't have that heavy of a plot so it moves pretty quickly.Overall, definitely an entertaining scifi movie to watch.

1. Goofy and unintentionally funny, desperately trying to be liked while constantly being unsure of himself.2. A down to earth good person that you're happy for when he gets a break in life.3. An understated charmer, that is outgoing and gets along with everybody.It was fun to try to spot the movies that inspired this mash-up:
Back to the Future: interacting with the grown family membersAlien and Prometheus like spaceship and the idea of aliens as weaponsThe Thing spaceship buried under iceEdge of Tomorrow's crawling limb aliensIndependence Day speech to inspire the troopsLogan's Run plot of elders being sent to a place that kills most of them.An Inconvenient Truth for the entire climate change metaphor.",The Tomorrow War
2729,xanderdpbarnard,"2 Movies crammed into 1, but fun",5,2 July 2021,"A fun movie if you go in with a open mind & don't want it to be over realistic. It builds the world very well with good pacing at the start. It draws you in straight away and you get enticed. If they made another film it would have complimented the world building and character building much better. It just feels rushed. Everytime you get drawn into something it feels like some random intense event happens that draws you straight out of the moment.The start 7/10
Middle 6/10
Ending 3/10
It's all fun though and enjoyable, thus why it is PG. You can watch with your family etc. But the movie is IMO undone by the ending it reminds me of a modern fast & the furious movie just way over the top & not needed. Could have been ended much easier for the characters & it would have been more enjoyable for us as the audience to see what we were watching all along be used to end the movie correctly. But allas they through it out the window & went with what should have been plan F. But the movie is worth watching but makes you ponder on what could have been.Acting. Pratt was mostly solid. His light hearted moments were great but some parts seemed a bit out. The writer's for the main character... For having to supposedly be a very intelligent human which we are shown throughout the movie, he makes some very very ridiculous decisions with everything including the world on the line, where you just want to pull your hair out & scream at the TV. The supporting cast was solid & some great comedy relief from Sam Richardson as Gator.But I digress. It is worth a watch if you enjoy sci fi, action and adventure. PS don't expect anything realistic or well thought out.",The Tomorrow War

This nails that on the head for me and honestly it isn't as silly a premise as i was first saying out loud in first 30 minutes of the movie, to my wife's utter annoyance haha. But it actually does come full circle and answer some of those ""why do it that way?!!""

The storyline was not bad but implementation was. The actors were ok-ish but it just didn't chug.My better half sort of sat through the whole ordeal and I was reading on some website waiting for a great plot change, which never came. They should have limited this film to 89 minutes...The FX were pretty OK but you can do a lot with digital these days and unfortunately that is not enough to carry a film.

While we haven't had as many releases as we would normally given the pandemic and halted production of a lot of films, I still would consider this a great movie even if it would've been made in a normal year.While not perfect, it's still a great, entertaining movie. Great action set pieces, funny one-liners sprinkled in here and there, and also a surprisingly emotional story are all present here.Lastly, I also feel as though the story told in this movie would've been better suited as a episodic series. They could have fleshed out more character development and we as the audience could have gotten to know some of these side characters a little more.So in closing, while lacking in character development for some of the side characters, I could not recommend this movie enough for an entertaining watch to spend the evening inside with loved ones.",The Tomorrow War

He is not being someone entirely different from many other films, but he does not have to be. It does not require it. Yvonne Strahovski makes me want to see her in more action movies! JK Simmons is surprisingly buff and is a really surprising and nice add to the cast.People who complain about the plot and dialog are not entirely off base but they are way too cynical. It is not that bad. It does not make you wince. It moves along nicely. And, it is a movie that tells an impossible, fictional story of a family healing. While that does not really offer life lessons it is a positive, feel good message that we can use in this world -- we don't need more cynics tearing us down.I say -- watch it and enjoy it -- if you don't try to be a critic, it will leave you happy.By the way -- the so-called huge plot hole -- isn't one.

However if you are to be a human being and watch the film for entertainment and actively try to enjoy it, it's a good pick. The reason for the 8/10 is because I enjoyed the film's action and overall premise. The plot had some holes around what happens when you go forward and back in time and could have done with some more explanation. It was also somewhat predictable. It's not a 100% serious action film as it clearly overdoes the slow motion etc. In conclusion, if you're looking for an entertaining watch and are not going to write your dissertation on time travel based on this film you will enjoy it.",The Tomorrow War

The aliens are scary and the the gunfire is loud and constant throughout.It could have had a lot more humour in it but only in the final half hour do the characters bounce off each other and provide some light-hearted dialogue.Talking of dialogue, this is the one area where the film completely falls down. The the score and the the SFX are way too loud, drowning out entire lines. I had to watch with subtitles to hear what the characters were saying in places, it was so indistinct. I'm no audio expert but I know this film was originally destined for movie theatres so whether the mix for that is different and it has not been altered for TV viewing I don't know.

Then also your personal has no idea what the enemy looks like (as you don't want to frighten them before combat), or know what their weak points are, more stupidity. Then the first action sequence shows me you have weaponry with limited success, this is more stupid that you would be sending people to 75% chance of certain death from a time when they would choose to live out their natural (or shortened lives). I was about deciding whether to turn it off at this point when in the next scene the hero meets someone that changes the rest of the movie.It then starts to take a downward spiral again when government officials with no idea of how to combat the situation or the origination will not consider a viable situation, so civilians have to go alone. Ridiculous plot, but I'm sure some people will have excuses. Then the civilians go into enemy territory with the solution that goes wrong then decide to use a more powerful solution (blow it all up) which would have made more sense as the first solution.The movie has ideas which with some sensible thought would have made it more enjoyable for someone like me, however it hasn't been thought through, or artistic license has ruined another.",The Tomorrow War

2821,juanpa1-1,Was this a parody?,6,4 July 2021,"This is the best worst movie I've ever seen.SPOILERS-FREE:The good: Great CGI, great action, good performances, entertaining, some interesting plot twists.The bad: Most jokes are a miss. Clichés everywhere. Chris Pratt's hairdo and wardrobe. The script's plotholes were covered with play-doh.Don't get me wrong. It was entertaining and good CGI. 90's vibe was so strong and there were so many cliches, at times it felt as a parody. At this point I am not sure if it was or not.The falling heroin reaching out dramatically while falling to her death in slow motion, probably there are enought secenes like this to make a short compilation.A slow motion body hitting a car which was completely unnecessary.HERE COME THE SPOILERS
This is what I mean by play-doh:The wife's realization of the one thing that will let them find the aliens was just lazy writing.They needed a Volcano expert and the best they could do, with humanity's future at stake, was a high school volcano aficionado.The hero's father happened to be a government-hating airplanes pilot, just because one of such will be needed near the end.The toxin that they worked so hard to get killed like 5 of the aliens, the rest were just blown up, that was hilarious.After finding the alien ship, they couldn't wait a couple days to make a plan, or at least get enough people and toxins for all the aliens in the ship, instead of storming inside and killing half of them. Guess what happened with the other half? Maybe if they brought some proof, after people saw time travelers in the soccer world cup's final match, they probably wouldn't think they were crazy.Not a waste of time, leave your brain at home and enjoy your popcorn.",The Tomorrow War
2822,krytycal,Sounded Good on Paper.,5,5 July 2021,"The weekend this movie came out, an unprecedented heat wave was pummeling the pacific northwest. With temperatures well over 110 degrees scorching my hometown, the premise of The Tomorrow War sounded timely and intriguing. A movie depicting present day humans sacrificing themselves to save the next generation of humans from extinction. Unfortunately, the description is about as thought-provoking as this movie gets. It all goes downhill from there.The biggest problem with the film is the lazy, formulaic writing. The lead character, Chris Pratt, is a science teacher who likes science and shooting video game trailer aliens. He prefers to spend his onscreen time squinting in apparent disbelief... Perhaps because he still can't believe he's getting paid for this. You also have the nerdy scientist, the strong daughter, the mean old man, and the jaded veteran. Out of the bunch, the jaded veteran was about the only character worth rooting for, mostly because he just wanted to die and be done with the film.The plot is not much better. Future humans desperately need help because there are only 500,000 humans left. A select group of present-day humans are being time-warped into the future to help. The selection process is complicated by the fact that they must be dead in the future. If 99.999% of humans have died, it must not be that hard to select people. Why send a rag tag team of science teachers, women and the morbidly obese instead of the military?If the government is willing to send its citizens to certain death in order to save the world, why won't they approve a mission to Russia once they come back with the solution?Future humans couldn't figure out the origin of the aliens because they did not see any spaceships in the satellite imagery at the time the aliens appeared? Yet they were smart enough to invent time travel to go back in time so that a science teacher and a 9-year-old kid can figure it out?Future humans drag a female specimen back to their base to collect samples, which could have been easily collected anywhere, in order to make sure the toxins kill the female. They discover the toxin, drag the whole alien colony into their base, and forget to kill the female.Wouldn't it be easier to blow up the ship or to shoot the aliens as opposed to injecting them with the toxin?Watched the film thinking it would be thought provoking. Turns out the less you think about it the better.",The Tomorrow War

The dialogue and the storyline are just okay. There are some funny lines that will make you chuckle, partly because they are placed right in the middle of a very tense situation. Some of the lines are cheesy and will make you cringe, but if you want great action sequences, you'll enjoy this movie! I watched it with my two teenage sons, and we were all sucked into the suspense. The movie does a great job at pausing longer than normal right before action breaks out to really build the anticipation. The reveal of the alien is very satisfying and terrifying, and we were all really impressed with how realistic it all looked. Savage.

As a family man who just likes a good movie that is engaging and has relatable characters (maybe flawed but plenty redeeming qualities) and a creative plot I'm convinced the average person would really love this movie. There are no hidden messages or underlying motifs meant to make you reflect or feel guilty about things. Just good old fashion action and some tear jerker moments. Chris Pratt just has a nack for bringing a relatable character who is the real life person we all are but the bad ass we all want to be at the same time. Charming and funny. His daughter was adorable and really brought the whole movie together with her performance and the way the two of them portrayed how a father would do anything for his child and how much of a profound effect his actions can have on their future...was truly beautiful.

There were some major logic holes...but it's not that kind of movie. You're supposed to accept the premise and then strap in for the ride. What I was not expecting was him seeing his daughter in the future...nor how well the two actors would pull off the relationship. I'm a sucker perhaps because I'm a Dad with a daughter. The supporting cast was enjoyable to watch. The aliens were horrific. The scenes near the end reminded me of Aliens.

Heck, I even enjoyed all the Stargate TV series. But this movie...ugh. This movie just made me think maybe Battlefield Earth wasn't so bad. This is just plain ugly. It's no Edge of Tomorrow. It's no Aliens. Not even close, although similar in plot content.Acting and script were down right terrible at times. The plot was messy and plot holes and character decisions that were just d.u.m.b. I always love when movies always feel the need to have that one character, who they want to make seem so incompetent or wimpy (although they may be a scientist or engineer) that they can't even hold a rifle remotely in the correct way. I'm not saying they can't be afraid, be a crappy shot, or unfamiliar with how to load it, but holding a rifle upside down or backward or whatever?

2869,LawrenceCooper,Dumb stupid worthless movie,5,2 July 2021,Aliens look dumb. They're fighting a war 30 years in the future and all the weapons are the same as 2021.Plot is rather basic and predictable.And I figured out how Pratt's character gets on with his job as soon as he showed up to training and met his new best friend.Who thought this would be a good idea?,The Tomorrow War

2874,rthursrt,Why did this movie get made???,3,10 July 2021,"Of all of the plots and movies that needed to be made after a pandemic year, they decided to make this one.....? This was the most white savior, billion explosion, ""I'm here to save my daughter"" type of movie I have ever seen. Skip it! I'm telling you, you have already seen this movie. Somehow Chris Pratt's character is the last one to arrive but knows everything, is the most skilled (lucky) and the most important one that somehow saves all of humanity. At this point it's just asinine to make this type of movie. And I'm saying this knowing what type of movie this is meant to be, but also knowing that there are other movies that do this genre better. I like Chris Pratt, but the truth is no matter who they got this movie would have stunk.",The Tomorrow War

And I'd give a solid 8 for that part of movie.But everything that happened after Prat went back is just a neverending sequence of facepalms.

2886,lawbug-43217,Fast Action...but I wanted to know more,6,31 August 2021,"I am a bit old-fashioned, in that I do not like movies that do part one, two, etc. However in this case I think they missed an opportunity The movie had me front the first scene right up until the end, when the Monster an alpha falls to her death/The fall much like when the Human Warrior, falls to her death, a death that may never happen.This would have been the place to stop the first half. The reason is when the main character jumps back, we jump back and the movie then has a sort of double climax, but is rushes through a little to much fo rme.I wanted to know more about these monsters, the ship and who or what resulted in them crash landing. We heard they were faster , smarter, and hungry but they could have made parts one and two and developed this in my opinion and I am not a fan of multi-part anything. I just think there is too much talent to have to resort to that kind of lazy movie making, unless there is something of interest.In this case, I was glad when he told the monster to die, but I would have been willing to learn more about them. Lots of great action , good story and pace keeps it interesting.",The Tomorrow War
2887,alooo-85514,So. Much. Fun.,9,10 November 2021,That was the most fun I've had watching a movie in quite a while. Classic cinema? Nope. But a really fun ride.

2892,terrybwickham,Take a sci-fi for a sci-fi,9,3 July 2021,A lot of reviews are negative which almost out me off watching. It's a good alien movie with time travel. Most time travel movies make zero sense if you try and make sense of them. Just take it as a sci-fi action moment and you'll enjoy it. It gave me Alien 2 meets Prometheus meets cloverfield vibes.,The Tomorrow War

2894,darrenbeams,The characters in this movie do not understand time travel,4,16 July 2021,"If you've seen Back to the Future or The Terminator you have a great sense of what time travel is about. And if you've seen Looper or Predestination or Primer then you are really time travel savvy. The people in this film have not seen any of these movies, they have not read the Time Machine or A Sound of Thunder, they appear to have never really thought about time travel at all, which is strange given they are in the presence of actual time travel.The movie starts off well enough with an interesting premise, and I was happy to suspend belief to a certain extent and just enjoy it, but there is a limit. And my limit, the point at which this movie became completely unforgivable, is when the hero, on returning to the past with a toxin that can kill all the aliens, says he has such a toxin and that they need to mass produce it and then SEND IT BACK -- yes, send it back to the future, a future he has just returned from in which everyone is pretty much dead. And the response to him is that the Jumplink just went offline and we can't send anything back and that ""WE CAN'T TRAVEL TO THE FUTURE."" Are you kidding me? You are right now sitting decades prior to the invasion with a toxin in hand that can kill all the invaders and are travelling, with every passing second, into the future. Mass produce the toxin over the course of years, you have around 30 or so before they invade, WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE!? It just goes downhill from here and really you only continue to watch from this point to see how much more of a mess it can become. Hint, it becomes more of a mess.Unforgivable and ridiculous, either the writers think we are idiots or they are idiots. What a waste of Chris Pratt, Yvonne Strahovski, J. K. Simmons and a whole lot of halfway decent CGI. Such a pity.",The Tomorrow War

The main characters are scientists but don't even pretend to pay lip service to time paradoxes--the future daughter tells her present father that he will leave his family and the exact day of his death. Hmm, wouldn't that change his decision-making (for example, stay away from any cars on that day, knowing he would die in a car crash)?

2902,hgw-51711,A brilliant sci-fi masterpiece!!!!,10,7 July 2021,"This film hits on all the right notes. Realistically I believe this movie deserves a 9 and not the 10 I gave it but because of the trash movies we've been getting the past couple years I think this is the definitive movie in the sci-fi genre post 2020. The character progression and tone are both as good as it gets. The main enemy is not only menacing but downright terrifying. To the point where you're wondering if Alien or Predator would last more than 10 seconds against a female white-spike! Everything from the cgi to the script is amazing to say the least! I haven't been so sucked into a sci-fi film since Interstellar and in many ways I believe this is Pratt's defining moment. Sure there's cliches here and there but it adds to the charm. The group of actors chosen brought depth and excitement to the film. I cannot recommend this film more highly and it is without a doubt the best streaming platform exclusive in my honest opinion. Anyone saying anything less than an 8 either had ulterior motives for their criticism or they're def, dumb, and blind. Now excuse me while I go start it over from the top! 10/10.",The Tomorrow War

It was literally on the edge of your seat the WHOLE movie!! I have watched a lot of alien movies and this one by far was one of the best!Chris Pratt was at his best in this film.

Dialogue and logic? Not so much.Spoilers*First off - Let's recruit people from the past but give them absolutely no training or proper equipment. Helpful information about the aliens? Just shoot for the abdomen and neck. What's the point of recruiting people if your just sending them to their deaths like cattle? Wouldn't giving them a chance to survive and be helpful be better?Next the attempt to inject humor during some scenes falls short. There's also a lot of cliche hero moments.The whole story of chris pratt's characters death is not in line with the story at all. Felt very out of place.The ending? They somehow manage to find the ship under a glacier in a single day. Why not just blow up the ship from safety instead of risking your lives to inject like 6 of the aliens with the toxin?All in all, it's entertaining and worth a watch if you got some spare time but no where near as complex of a story as it could have been with the ideas that were there.",The Tomorrow War

If you turn off your brain for the second hour and 2 mins maybe you'll enjoy. They obviously put a lot of money into it with a few big names. Chris Pratt does a good job, but did no one see all the holes? It lacks common sense at a lot of turns. I could get past a few like why wouldn't everybody already be trained ahead of time if they very possibly would get drafted? Why wouldn't any country be on board with destroying the enemy well ahead of time, why wouldn't you just blow the ship instead of going in it destroying 1 by 1. Its a shame it wasn't more thought out. Idk if it was worth the hours of my time.",The Tomorrow War

And, for any of this to work they have to Branch off. You can't have something that was created in the future and take it into the past to fix the future because it would just disappear, unless it branched off time lines. Do any of y'all that gave bad reviews watch Rick and Morty, or The Avengers? This is like basic multiverse theories and it's not new information.

2921,brandonduger,Good movie with usual BS.,8,10 July 2021,"The plot reminds me of Live. Die. Repeat's with the future timeline thread. The creatures were perhaps the most unique and actually fun designs Ive seen in a very LONG time. Im pretty sure the first time you actually see them close up it was practical effects we are looking at, not CGI. Though I could be wrong. There was the usual BS with people getting thrown around and WAY too unbelievable scaled combat situations. And of course people believing they can outrun explosions. Only in movie logic. Then there were the s!#&:guns they gave them. Really? No shotguns, grenades or missile launchers? I was very disappointed in that. Would think scifi writers today could learn from scifi games like Doom Eternal. Heavy cannon beats wimpy assault rifle any day. And then they were having better luck with the pistols versus the rifles. A good movie that was a combination of Aliens, Predator, Predator 2, AVP, The Thing (1982 - the first appearance scenes), The Thing (2011 - beginning and ending of this with the ship, also tentacle design), Doom Eternal (if you watch it it's towards the end of the movie I think, also creature has Hell Knight looks), Doom 3 (Bravo Team scene repetitively, along with Hell Knight design) and D&D (Phase Cat mixed with a Qlippoth design).

And why did all the time they use a gun to fight alien, not thing seem to advanced than right now. I mean I expected some laser gun or gun that can use air pressure as fuel so that they can use it as much as they desire. Plus the warships!! I known some Land base attack weapon like where we used to use in WWII, a shell that when I was fire I explode it explode into multiple shells. And it was in the FUTURE where the teleportation is a thing. Don't they develop such weapon to fight back at all?? So disappointed.Lastly, I don't know I am a bad person or what. But I tired to see another good, brave, tons of leadership protagonist that can not leave small portion of people to die.

I felt anxious when lights flickered and the music built a nice crescendo.

The most touching aspect of the film is the importance of a father daughter relationship but of course the woke mob and critics in the woke culture will complain about the ""lack of diversity"". The film couldn't have come at a better time. Everyone is celebrating the 4th but fail to realize that it is our military members and their service that keep this country free and allows them to sit behind their computers, phones and Twitter to complain about their liberties.

I do agree, there are some plot holes in the story and they haven't nailed the whole timeline thing. The humour was more than expected which I personally thought was great, but did take away from the heart-felt emotional side just a tiny bit. I thought the CGI was incredible and made it as realistic as possible without being overpowering.Sam Richardson was great in that role, J. K. Simmons was amazing like always, Yvonne Strahovski was great and Chris Pratt was in his element with this film. Only problem with the acting was that I wasn't emotionally attached to any of the characters really, felt like it could have been more convincing.Overall a strong 9/10, not the most logical but wow is it entertaining and I'm sure I'll be watching this over and over again.",The Tomorrow War

Jammed full of action-movie tropes. A really weird and contrived take on time travel. Not just one but multiple slow-mo shots of the hero being thrown forward, fully back-lit by explosions.I cannot for the life of me understand how so many talented people got roped into a movie that is so badly conceived, not just in execution but even in theory.

I've seen it three times and everyone I watched it with enjoyed it. It doesn't have ridiculous ""cold fusion"" bombs, but it is about time travel and aliens. Either accept it all, or none of it. The nitpickers want so much from this movie that you couldn't fit it all in a ten episode series.All in all enjoying. It has fantastic CGI. The aliens are unique and scary.

2982,rmbzsmjh,Slam Dunk Blockbuster Hit!!,9,3 July 2021,"🎥 🍿 ""The Tomorrow War"" is a slam dunk blockbuster hit!!!! Chris Pratt stars as Daniel Forester, retired spec ops soldier, now family man and high school science teacher. The world is under attack by aliens and they need regular, normal, people...to be heroes.Remember those Call of Duty commercials with Kobe Bryant, Jonah Hill, Robert Downey, Jr, Jimmy Kimmel, etc? Portraying everyday people thrust into the action scenes of a first person shooter video game...in street clothes? That's exactly what this whole movie looks and feels like. And I'm sure it was intentional.Don't think too hard about the logic. This isn't a ""science"" or ""time travel"" movie per se. It's a throw back to ""Independence Day"" and ""Starship Troopers"" and it is over-the-top action, funny one liners, and a sweet sentimental family dynamic that gives the whole thing a heart.This is a must-see for the whole family. Small children might be scared by the aliens. They're pretty creepy. It's free on Amazon Prime Video!!!😊👍👍",The Tomorrow War

Which is surprising since such actors like Chris Pratt or J. K. Simmons are in it. Script writers didn't give them much chance to shine though in their comedy skills. It was missed opportunity. It made it so much harder to swallow this movie, because the storyline has basically no sense. And I don't mean typical paradoxes of SF movies with timetravels, that was expected though it seems main characters never saw a movie about it and were clueless about consequences of their actions. Also small things like for example the bombing scene where bunch of people half of them old and obese escapes but no alien which are kind of super creature like in Aliens. So at one moment those were aliens like Xenomorphs and a minute later some easy killable sheeps.Overall I'm dissapointed, they could do so much more with this story.

Great thrilling moments as the humans were being hunted or swarmed with some sweet special effects. The time travel elements made for some head scratching but I found thinking a good use of the down time in the film.I really enjoyed just relaxing and watching good action and a non-believable ending.

I like Chris Pratt, but he was dealt a bad hand here with the terrible, outrageous writing.On top of the never-ending bullets in their weapons, used by mostly civilians who have no idea how to use them, in a war zone where they're given zero intelligence on what the enemy is or how to kill them. What really got me was how, after not asking for any government support, even after being in the war zone, they decide it's better to go rouge and fly into somewhere in Russia in a C-130 WITHOUT apparently refueling! And they would've had to fly at low level, which would've used more fuel, yet you never saw them having to refuel the plane-- not possible! And how is it they just happened to land right where the alien spaceship was?? It's not like Russia is a small country-- sheesh. And if they could just blow them up in the underground cave, and not need the magical anti-alien toxin, then why not just bring more explosives and blow them up! Double sheesh.",The Tomorrow War

3008,jpmamed,The message we still need to hear...,8,4 July 2021,"The movie may have its flaws, but the core of its story is something that we still need to watch out there. It remembers me about ""Marriage Story"", as the plot here also explores the problem of divorce in the children's life. Through his future daughter, Dan discovers that he abandoned his family and died by an accident (probably a car accident). Shocked, finally, it seems, he finally understand that the main purpose of his life is to love his close ones and fight for them.This is a message that I enjoyed to watch. My parents were divorced, although I had them with me, my elder half-brothers had not them as they were growing. I know this affected them in some degree. This is a sad thing to see happening in a family, because adultery or just giving up one another, just bring chaos and suffering for the own couple and for the children.I hope other people may reflect when watching this. Marriage may be not easy to some people. I am married, but before I got married, I studied a lot with my girlfriend. We chatted a lot, we read a lot of books about marriage, etc.We married after almost 6 years and until our marriage we kept chastity and a daily life of friendship and prayer (we are Reformed Christian), so, I use to tell to the others something that I could not hear from the older ones: marriage is wonderful. Marry and be merry! Don't believe in what some people say, that marriage is like a prison or something horrible.But I put here an advice: marriage is not to make yourself happy, but to find ways to make the other one happy. I harvest the good fruits of my wife's love, because I track new trails to learn how to pour myself for her wellfare day by day.

In fact every movie watched with him in it have been action packed and had great flow with other actors. I feel like he also hated this movie, the compatibility with the actors, and tried his best to make up for that. Even his acting was forced. Why did they choose such shoddy actors to work with him? I also had to forward it a ton while watching it on my phone because it was so boring in certain parts. The adult daughter actor sucked balls.

Script was for a B SciFi movie, plot holes everywhere, some of it didn't even make sense.The plot was written for Elementary & Middle School Kids, by a Writer still in High School, at least it seems that way lol. I could tell what some lines were gonna be before they even said them, the little bit of humor the writer tried to inject here & there were wasted opportunities as well.The Acting is what saved this from being a total flop and gave this a 5/10 IMO (I'm being generous), plus the Backstory on most characters were extremely weak.Being over 2hrs/20mins they had plenty of time for character development, but instead of character development & a good script,

3023,imdb-62471,I had a blast watching this film,8,19 July 2021,"I had a blast watching this film. I'm one of those people who take apart films with a fine-toothed comb, but I still enjoyed it.Let's start with the interesting things.The aliens. Like with all good scary flicks, the monster was revealed only after a while. After it was revealed, it hit all the right spots for a scary one - the inhuman teeth, the tentacles, nearly invulnerable, etc. I loved the design and I think they could do a lot with it.The final alien ship. At first, I thought that they were transporting the spikes as research specimens of some sort, but it later became clear that they were carried as deployable weapons of war. Almost like the opposite of Prometheus.The time travel tech. It was explicitly said to be held together with chewing gum and chicken wire. As a tech geek, I loved that touch. It telegraphed the desperation of the future side if they chose to use _that_ as their last resort. Another touch was that people would immediately scream when they were in transport mode and were ""beamed"" to the future. You most definitely do not scream if the process is pleasant. Arbitrary limitation of the 30-year interval was also cool, as was the concept of the ""raft"" floating downstream, and thus the explanation of why the war effort was done in ""realtime"" on both sides.The not so good thing:Plot holes. Massive, giant plot holes large enough to drive a space ship through. I managed to turn off my filter and enjoy the movie, but it didn't work logically. Any nerd aware of time travel could come up with a different battle plan than the characters in the movie.Put yourself in their shoes. It's likely that your first instinct would be to just evacuate the hell out of anyone still left in the future. There's only half a million of them. Not a lot of difficulty to integrate them into today. Some of them would be scientists, and they would likely bring the compendium of human knowledge from the year 2051. Suffice to say that the tech boost could be significant and might turn the tides of the war. At the very least, they wouldn't be in immediate danger.Overall, I think this was a good flick for watching with your family. The suggestion that the spikes were weapons of some much more powerful race is a loose end that could see The Tomorrow War 2 coming out to pit our good ol' humanity against an interstellar empire bent on domination, beaten back by the magic of time travel.",The Tomorrow War

Don't waste your time on this movie..",2,6 July 2021,"If you're looking for a mindless action flick than you have got your pick. But the thing is, the movie creators have tried to make this movie thought provoking and intelligent, which is laughable by any standard. My 5 year old niece could write a better plot than this convoluted take on time travel and aliens. There are so so many loopholes. Let me list a few below:1. Future soliders knew that aliens first surfaced in Russia and the year. So shouldn't they have just focused on ensuring that aliens die in Russia itself??2. They say that they only hire people who are already dead, however only 0.5 million people are alive at the time of war, so almost 7 billion are available for war?3. Why future soliders did not bring any aliens to the present to do some research on them? They could have found weaknesses of the aliens?4. Given that serum is crucial for survival of humans, why does the scientists ask for her father for this mission?5. The end is that they destroy the alien ship. So essentially the movie is a wastr of time ? They don't need the vial?There are so so many problems in thr movie, for your logic sake, don't watch this movie.",The Tomorrow War

It could have been so much better but is let down by a terrible script. The script writers for this filth should be named and shamed and publicly flogged. Forget the forced coincidences and gargantuan plot holes. A couple of random examples of just how bad this gets: the protagonists need to find out how volcanic ash made its way from one continent to another. Do they ask the world's leading authority on volancoes? Or even a professor with subject matter knowledge? No, they ask a high school kid who likes volcanoes who we were clumsily introduced to earlier in the film. Shortly after that, the same protagonists need to fly to Russia to destroy the aliens. Now mankind is facing complete extinction, the world is in meltdown but they're not allowed to fly because the taxpayer can't afford it. Hilarious. Don't worry though, the hero's father can fly them who we were also clumsily introduced to earlier in the film. This is bad folks.

Of course JK Simmons is always a ""plus"" in every movie he appears, and here's no different.Other highlight is the near-perfection CGI, which is really mind-blowing.

The special effects are awesome, really awesome quality of effects, you can't compare them to Marvel, but they are good.

But many avoidable holes in the story.I couldn't stop thinking ""Why not tanks, why not underground bases, why no more aerial bombardment etc "" and I think more people would be asking themselves the same questions. If somebody made a few small comments like ""we have tried nukes, but a few hours after explosion they didn't even stop"" or ""we tried building underground bases but X happened"" it would really help the story.Suspension of disbelief is a good tool, but not when it's needed every 5 minutes.Pistols seemed equally efficient as assault rifles... Interesting?From non-military perspective it would also help to put a bit more focus on the wife.

No political correctness just a true sci fi movie that groups a bunch of random people together to fight an unwin-able battle. As with any good movie there needs to be some tense moments, one liners, redemption and of course some reality defying survival of main characters. I am not sure there has been any Chris Pratt movie that has been bad. But the rest of the cast really pulled it together, side characters had back stories, sacrifice and overall arcs. Some predictable moments for sure, such as dying on your own terms. The twist of them being there the whole time but as a possible crash site was nice.

3081,brianwgoodner,I'm surprised so many have trouble following this movie,9,2 July 2021,"It's really not that complicated and one of the time travel movies that makes more sense and they are careful to address potential paradoxes and explain how the time travel works.It really is a very entertaining action movie with some heart and emotion, and for a long running time, I was glued to the screen the entire time.While some compare it to others, it is a unique concept that you may be able to compare bits and pieces to some other movies, even some popular ones that are inferior. It's not Aliens or even Edge of Tommorrow, but it's not far off from the latter and far better than other movies like War of the Worlds or Independence Day.The critics seem to have missed the boat on this one, as many were unable to follow. I understand many critics are young and new to this with their new websites over the last few years, but not only could many not follow it or found it incoherent (it's not if you give it some thought), they don't seem to rate it for what it is and what it is aiming for. An entertaining summer blockbuster type. It's certainly as entertaining as most of the Marvel movies, Fast and Furious ones or video game movies...and of course all the remakes of movies of 20 years ago.I suggest you give it a watch and don't even read reviews before or after. Judge for how much you enjoy and don't give it a 1 rating like many seem to and say they do, without even watching it or even only watching 5 minutes.There are a few little things they could have maybe cleaned up, but nothing major, and this goes for just about any movie like this.I suggest you sit back, watch and enjoy. If you watch with the family on a big screen, I'm guessing all will be entertained. Personally I would have loved to watch it at the theater, maybe in 3D and/or IMAX.",The Tomorrow War

The movie looks good, it's not boring - mostly because something is happening all the time. But it's riddled with plot holes, it can't decide whether it wants to be serious or a comedy (the jokes aren't very funny), and every time you think it's ending, they add a supplemental plot and our heroes just go on a new mission in a neverending cycle.",The Tomorrow War

Sure there may some plot holes, but at-least the movie does attempt to give a satisfactory explanation. I was expecting there to be more plot holes after watching the trailer, but there didn't seem to be anything that took me out of the movie. I'm glad that Chris Pratt got his chance to be an executive producer for his first movie and I gotta say it's a good ""first"". The CGI and VFX in this movie are great! The time travel worm-hole was spectacular and the Aliens had the right amount of ""Scary looking and hard to kill.....but not too hard up to the point where viewers are appalled by the humans managing to kill a few"". Sam Richardson's character, Charlie, had some pretty hilarious moments which complimented Chris Pratt's subtle comedic nature. In all, this movie gets a solid 8/9 from me.",The Tomorrow War

It's dumbed down, very predictable, and Hollywoodised if you really use your brain. Also, it combines plots from older films that make this film lack originality a lot. Chris Pratt is another person who sold his soul to military terrorism that promotes violence-glorifying films for his dark and toxic ego. Disgusting. Basically, what happens in this film is that people fight against aliens with the US versus THEM mentality. They kill aliens, lose human casualties, win against the alien race, and people have their relatively happy ending. It's something that has already happened in much older films. You're not getting something revolutionary nor high quality here. It's like very cheap candy that rots your brain.",The Tomorrow War

My husband was on his phone through the explanation and later said the movie didn't make sense. Don't be my husband or you're going to be confused. I do agree the logic could have been done better and some of the cheesy comedy right before the logic explanation could have been done away with. There is a whole lot of action in this movie but at times it seemed a bit predictable and other times not predictable. As long as you don't go into the movie with extremely high expectations of watching a 10/10 movie, or diddle daddle on your phone, it will be an enjoyable experience.

The negative reviews of this film are mind-blowing!,10,3 July 2021,"I see so many reviews talking about how the plot isn't logical or that it doesn't adhere to proper ""space/time continuum"" theory, or some other, contrived nonsense. I am really impressed by the number of freaking time travel experts we have cranking out bad reviews from their mother's basement. If anything, I think the bad reviews of this movie are a reflection of where we are at in society. People, for the most part, like to destroy the credibility of just about anything if it can provide them some false sense of intellectual or artistic superiority in doing so.This movie had everything you could possibly want....an interesting premise, amazing CGI, heart-pounding action scenes, and likeable characters. I would give this movie 12 out of 10 stars if I could and I wish all the time travel experts out there would hurry up and actually figure out time travel so they can travel 500 years into the future and leave the present day to folks who don't take things so seriously.",The Tomorrow War

We don't know what exacly are glaciers hiding? Also, we don't know what kind of danger can come from the space?

Lots of action scenes throughout the entirety of the movie with some pretty heartfelt moments. I think most people would enjoy the film and don't think the plot holes are that big of a deal in the grand scheme of things. Not sure why this movie is getting absolutely trashed but my guess is that's it's politically fueled due to Chris Pratt rather than it being that much of a bad film.,The Tomorrow War

The CGI was perfect! The way they designed the monsters was so scary... There was a perfect amount of action and backstories. I rate this a 10/10, one of the best alien shows I have ever watched.

Aliens look creepy and are scary
Lots of crash, bang, wallop
Good effects
Cast looks good on paper
Tonnes of alien gooCons
Good cast but there's a lot of hammy acting
Storyline is imaginative but it's very formulaic in certain respects. I played predict the story line during the film and predicted most of the plot twists
There's a lot of cheesy acting
Hard to get emotionally attached to the leads
For some reason there appears to be homage to one of the Twilight films towards the end (can't remember which one), but I'm not sure if it was intentional.Felt a bit too long but you can boil a kettle/watch footie on the tv/play scrabble whilst watching and you won't need to back up as the plot is so obvious you can pick it back up in 30 seconds.It's an okay film but I won't be watching it again or recommending it.As an aside, would definitely give nightmares to most little 'uns.",The Tomorrow War

And only a certain selected few qualify to be drafted , Film answered both questions for me 1) To prevent the war to happen in 30 years obviously (But why not volunteer??) 2) those selected for the draft have died between now and then in 30 years , so theres no doubles in the film (understandable , possibly a time glitch rule not talking to your future self lol)8/10 reason being is the fact it took awhile for my eyes to adjust towards the CGI. The first alien sightings you see are computer generated to the T lol but it got better though out the film , once I got through the CGI the Story is gripping indeed , sending random Civies to the future with only 2/3 with military experience to fight against a unidentified alien object ( Realistic in my own opinion , Wars evolve everyone not just trained soldiers) , character growth and scripts were well done , certain parts felt offish but it panned out good , the plot is great indeed , the sceneries are truly amazing and the creations of the aliens is like a demon from hell , Hell I would either cry or laugh knowing it will eat me.The battles in the city is on the edge of your seat entertaining , you're anxiously waiting to see who dies and hoping it's not your character you've grown upon , the story keeps you attached as you see everything unfold and the questions you have in your mind answered bit by bit.Didn't really give out spoilers , but I'm sorry if I did to much explaining.",The Tomorrow War

I love a good Sci-fi movie and I love one even more when it involves reminders of Climate Change. I thought it was a unique experience. It wasn't really that predictable to me. It did remind of of The Terminator though but I love the Terminator movies. Chris Pratt would do a movie like this since his wife is Arnold Schwarzenegger's daughter. I love Chris Pratt films because he's a good actor, he's funny and he's the next action hero (Like Arnold only better acting chops, sorry Arnold I still love ya) I loved this film so much that I plan on blasting it on our outdoor projector screen in the backyard tonight.",The Tomorrow War

3146,tremelltv,Second Chances Are Hard To Come By,8,5 July 2021,"""The Tomorrow War"" was filmed by Chris McKay in 2019, the film is a ""sci-fi"" / ""action-adventure"" with a original story that has a message of what can be achieved when you don't give up and second chances. I liked the movie for its character development, time traveling plot and comedic takes from Chris Pratt and Sam Richardson.The movie starts with a former Green Beret by the name of Dan Forester (Chris Pratt) on a call with a potential employer for his dream job of being a scientist at a highly prestigious research center. As Dan settles in to watch the world cup at a Christmas party with his wife (Betty Gilpin) and daughter (Ryan Kiera Armstrong / Yvonne Strahovski - Adult), a portal opens in the middle of the field with soldiers from the future warning of a upcoming attack from a alien species called ""the whitespikes"" in the year of 2051. In response, members of the world's militaries are sent into the future, but fewer than 20% survive, prompting a world wide draft.The draftees selected are everyday people typically over the age of 30, this is deduced by Dan and Charlie (Sam Richardson) during basic training, by sending someone into the future that's presence is not going to cause any disturbance with time creating a time paradox. The mission that the draftees are being sent on is to assist their future children and grandchildren with holding off the extension of the human race caused by invasion of ""the whitespikes"".I enjoyed following Dan's character development from being disappointed in the outcome of his life after serving two tours in Iraq and becoming a high school science teacher. To a devoted family man that will do whatever it takes to give his daughter a future. And typically time travel plots get a bit complicated but this one was straight to the point of the explanation of why draftees can only be sent to this time period and back. There is some blood and gore in this movie but not enough to earn a R rating but there are some funny moments in the movie that lighten up the tone and don't feel forced in anyway. I highly recommend watching this unexpected action packed time traveling ride of a movie.",The Tomorrow War

Even the monsters we are used to watch on epic aliens movies have some attractive or recognition based on their appearance or power of external morphology. These type of aliens moving so fast without any special treat of killing abilities or powers could have been improved. Imagination fell short here. Chris Pratt wasn't bad at all, but his emotional scenes, expressions towards his daughter were not authentic, he may have produced the film, but man, maybe another actor could have been printing a better character. Aside of that, the story is entertaining and the special effects look real.",The Tomorrow War

There's humor...there's intense action....there's heroism, but there are also some deeper underlying themes about our ability to create a stronger family bond or to completely break it.

3152,blfluery,Great fourth of the July flick,10,3 July 2021,"Loved this movie, exactly what I was looking for in a sci-fi flick, it could ended at one pivotal point but continued on. Is is The Godfather no but for a entertaining movie it was great.",The Tomorrow War
3153,lucian-12105,Good movie to watch,8,4 July 2021,"I did like the movie , sure it has its ups and downs but for this kind of movies its difficult to come with a wow factor idea. From my point of view I think this could have a follow up considering the ending. Not going to spoiler and all tough.Probably not something that everyone will like but it is one of the good movies to watch this summer.",The Tomorrow War
3154,dog_lover-henry,Good fast paced action,9,4 July 2021,I see a lot of people confused by the time travel. But the timeline after Dan comes back diverges from when he went to the future because of the different actions that the characters take. Also they did save humanity with the toxin because they killed the female. Just wish the army guy at the end recognises them for it.,The Tomorrow War
3155,sadstamper,Better than I expected!,8,4 July 2021,"Unique storyline and lots of action!! I thought the special effects were amazing and the creatures were creepy as hell!! Enjoyed it thoroughly, I was entertained the whole time!! Chris Pratt did a great job with this!",The Tomorrow War
3156,dxnvxn,Time Travel Always Has Issues,8,4 July 2021,"First let me say, it may be a bit for small children. With all the different video games these days, maybe not?? I don't know but viewer discretion is definitely advised. It might be nightmare stuff for young kids. But, If you are looking for an action packed edge of your seat alien, time travel, sci-fi movie. The cgi was well done. Did have a problem with the sound. Dialogue was difficult to hear. The music was very loud. Any time you have time travel I find an issue. You go to the future you always change the past. Or do you? It's always a confusing concept with the back & forth. Anyway, I don't want to give too much away. If you are looking for a fun, thriller of a movie. This is it. I love that they showed the aliens full on! I hate when movies are dark & and you see a claw here, a tail there, some slobber. You see these bad boys & girl up close & personal! I personally am a Chris Pratt fan so I pretty much like most of his movies. If you have 2+ hours to kill & want some loud, fun entertainment, this is it.",The Tomorrow War

This 'war' should have been over long ago.There are people that like this movie, good for them ...there are people that liked District 9 as well though I can't figure out why, I would have walked out of that one if I wasn't at the theater with friends.

My adrenaline was up but they found moments to not take themselves so seriously. It reminded me of the movie Aliens, the desperation with time and lives counting down. Go watch in don't be pretentious. It isn't a philosophical masterpiece that makes you question the meaning of the universe. People shoot aliens and things explode, ALOT! It's well worth the watch for the enjoyment.",The Tomorrow War
3162,martlefe,Very entertaining,7,4 July 2021,"This one would probably be much, much better on the big screen. It has thousands of mean aliens, big explosions and bogus science. Of course it doesn't make sense! Of course it's overdone and over the top. It was, however, very entertaining and that's all I ask for a movie.",The Tomorrow War
3163,cmsbdctk,Thoroughly enjoyed,9,4 July 2021,"Like it says in the title, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. The action and CGI was spot on, storyline was pretty solid.

3165,oliver-50309,Fun,7,4 July 2021,Let's be honest it's not Pacino in godfather but a helk of a lot of fun. A definite stretch of the imagination but good action good acting and even some of the jokes work. A little similar to Edge of Tomorrow but that's ok took it in a fun direction and made it its own. And of course Chris Pratt has certainly come into his own with jurassic universe and marvel and he can add another notch in his belt for producing this fun sci-fi ride.,The Tomorrow War
3166,goindowntheriver,Your eyes might roll out of your head,1,4 July 2021,"Sickly sweet family nonsense, boring one to one ""drama"" to pad out the movie length, forced ""diversity and inclusion"" (just about every military authority is female and black or Asian). Then the supposed everyday American military unit so that the viewer can relate to them... Oh look that fat middle aged person who never fired a gun is like me.. how unique. Just lame.The CGI is top notch in some places, that's about the only redeeming feature.",The Tomorrow War
3167,Dalton27,At least I was entertained and it made me laugh,6,4 July 2021,"I like Chris Pratt and I love science fiction movies. However, good scifi movies need to be based on some type of common sense logic. A movie like The Matrix (which I watched again recently for like the 30th time :) achieves this.So if you can shut your mind off for 2+ hours and don't question anything, you can still have a good time. I guess this is what happens to stars who get bored and just need to make movies for a living.Look at Tom Cruise who starred in movies like Edge of Tomorrow and Equilibrium. Both scifi movies were entertaining but at the same time forgettable.",The Tomorrow War

3170,rickskrueger,Best movie 2021,10,4 July 2021,"Do not listen to the critics or the people that give this move a 1 star. I only signed up with IMDB to make this rating. This movie is about a man trying to save his family specifically his daughter. This is a movie about traditional values and a man and his family wife and daughter. He loves this country and sacrifices as does his daughter as well. This movie is by far the best movie of the year and maybe there are some issues with the going ahead in time but Chris Pratt deserves an Oscar for this movie. This country is becoming too woke and it's disturbing and against anything for the traditional family. This movie has it all and you will not be disappointed. Ignore the people that complain about the movie. This is what America is about saving true world and the people and Chris Pratt is a awesome American and Christian man and a great actor that finally a movie has traditional values of sacrifice, love for ones country and this world and to do all they can for their family and to stand by them and fight for them. If there ever was a time for a movie like this. It is now. Go away woke mob. Your garbage needs to stop being produced.",The Tomorrow War

There are plenty of good sci-fi books with original stories to get new ideas,don't throw bits gathered form other movies together.very Daja vu,go watch the others i mentioned first then you'll have no need to watch this.",The Tomorrow War

3186,nrcmk,New twist to stand out,8,4 July 2021,In a time where it seems there are only remakes and 120 part franchises this movie was a breath of fresh air. Reminds you of the time where aliens where scary. It's one of those movies where you love the action and it is emotional at times. The comedic relief is a bit miss placed but still funny.

The attempted emotional scenes fall flat. There is constant exposition that is shown to be wrong before the echo of the words has faded, it's a shame, if it were half as good as live, die, repeat that would've been something, just watch that instead or watch this drunk or stupid, you'll won't notice the many, many plot holes.",The Tomorrow War

Definitely a fun movie that got straight to the point without too many fluffy scenes.",The Tomorrow War
3192,seven5tx,Very Good,8,4 July 2021,I just watched the film and it was very good and exciting. It was not OMG great but very enjoyable. I admit that I am very easy to please. My one turn off is low production values. This film was worth watching.I don't understand those who criticize everything. They can suck the joy out of any experience. You know the type.

So many that it took away my immersion.There were two or three running away from explosion moments. Lots of predictable scenes. And the whole plot took a stupidity boost after Pratt comes back from the future. Then to top it all, the super poison from the future is not better than a small amount of explosives.

Remember this fact, they just open a passage by using a ton of explosives and there are thousands of aliens. If one wakes up, the Alien will immediately call the others.At that point, they would spread really fast, and even with the Poison, many people would die. Besides there are thousands of aliens.This movie could even end with a Nuke scene or with 30.000 soldiers (with poison bullets) killing all those aliens.The actors did very well, the character development was excellent and the special effects were great!",The Tomorrow War

It dragged on and on and on. I found myself waiting for the aliens to win just so that the movie would be over quicker. This reminded me of your standard Hollywood movie were people don't run of ammo and it's so incredibly predictable. I'm just glad I didn't have to pay for this movie directly. Too much special effects that added to the ridiculousness of it all.,The Tomorrow War
3212,adamsoles,"Great action, decent acting, ok storyline",7,5 July 2021,Chris Pratt carries and the supporting cast does good enough in this action packed sci-fi. I think overall this was a really solid movie. It's not an award winner but it's far from a flop. The action is great and nonstop and the CGI was really well done. It's also not an entirely far fetched storyline allowing you to sink in without busting out the foil caps. Enjoy this summer movie with the kiddos and turn on the surround sound. It's a fun one!,The Tomorrow War

3214,fxspiral-11904,"Average CGI, serviceable acting and a watchable plot.",5,5 July 2021,"Although following many clichés through this action man genre such as the 'ex army man' and family at home situation, I do believe the tomorrow war tried to do something different.But unfortunately what they tried was an utter failure. Tackling the concept of time travel is no easy feat and although it's more subjective than objective, there's so many logical lapses and impossible situations in this movie that it is almost unbearable.The concept isn't well explained to the viewer and the otherwise interesting topic was put down to a simple plot device.That wasn't my only issue though. With the 'emotional' scenes lasting ages in apparent 'urgent situations, the jokes being made very rarely ever landing with me and the disappearance of characters throughout the film to conveniently appear at the end was moronic. E.g the comic relief guy and the apparent father!This film is a fine watch for those who like to turn off when watching something or have it in the background when doing something else.

Lots of beautiful cityscapes and scenery and massive fight scenes. Story is okay, a little confusing why their first tactic to defeat the alien race was to create time travel, go into the past and take them to the future. This isn't a terrible idea, but makes no sense when they end up creating a poison to kill the aliens after they stolen millions of people from the present.

3229,janeee81,entertaining summer movie,8,6 July 2021,Great CGI and great action. JK S ripped and great in his limited screen time. Great entertainment for summer plot somewhat as expected but still interesting. Chris Pratt did his usual stick but that's kind of what a person wanted when you saw the trailer. Few holes as always but not worth thinking too hard about for an summer blockbuster type. I enjoyed it and would recommend.,The Tomorrow War

3234,samuelavrz,Mindless fun,8,6 July 2021,Giving this movie an extra star simply due to the unnecessary hate this film is getting. This film has a great hook and keeps you entertained most of the way through. There were several plot holes and inconsistencies throughout the film however the premise of the movie is bound to cause problems. Pratt mostly does a great job in the lead role and all of the supporting cast was great. The CGI was also pretty impressive. Don't go in with mountain expectations and you'll get a movie that is much better than most coming out this year.,The Tomorrow War

3236,giovanninava,B movie with a huge budget,1,6 July 2021,The plot holes in this movie are infuriating. Do these people ever sit down and think about possible plot holes or if the story makes sense or not? I guess it doesn't matter because they're collecting money while I'm sitting here mad that I just wasted 2 hours and 20 minutes of my life watching this. I should have just turned on a B movie on the sci-fi channel. That would have probably had less plot holes and I would be happier about my choice to watch it.,The Tomorrow War

I fixed it for you tho....",8,6 July 2021,"I loved everything about this movie except the weak mushy play dough part in the middle that smells and taste weird like play dough. All the actors are awesome,but there is terrible continuity issues. If you use time travel and you are sending people to fight armored aliens, I would believe that you would send them with weapons that can pierce armor... I mean that's a thing that has existed for a while right? Also if this was in the alien franchise, it would have been the best alien movie made in almost 30 years. Bezos has the money to buy or rent into the franchise! Leave everything almost the same, just change the white monsters into the iconic jet black horrors from years past and POW, there goes the continuity issues about sending people into the future with basically pistols to take out armored aliens... leave the queens, keep the acid blood, and the mindless drones... best alien movie since aliens.

It draws inspiration from Edge of Tomorrow, Aliens/Prometheus, Independence Day etc - but that is no bad thing.The assembly of characters are a pretty much the types you would expect to find, the plot is fairly routine in parts, the CGI is decent enough though and the action comes thick and fast.If you are the sort of person who questions every logical aspect of a sci-fi film, laments for originality and seeks thought provoking plots - then this probably isn't for you.If you enjoy fast paced sci-fi that has a decent cast, decent CGI and has many action sequences, that isn't too bothered that the synopsis treads a well trodden path - then you'll probably enjoy this with a large helping of popcorn.",The Tomorrow War

This will keep you on the edge of your seat. It has a lot of elements-funny, action packed, not overly complicated plot, great CG, unexpected plot twists and a strong family theme. You won't see the plot twists coming which I liked and the actors were believable. I like how things tied in right down to the HS student. I actually watched this a second time and loved it just as much as the first time. I was entertained and it's with great enthusiasm that I would recommend this movie to others!

3247,shroomiecloud,A 200 million dollar well animated comedy with gratuitous action,4,7 July 2021,"To start off, don't expect too much from this movie. If you're looking for Transformers level ridiculous action and entertainment with bits of comedy thrown in; it should fullfill that, there's nothing wrong with wanting it and you should stop reading reviews and just watch it now.The animation quality was EXCELLENT, I absolutely loved the white spikes and the action they were involved in. Their introduction throughout the second act was great and I really felt like they were alive and fairly scary, but very quickly towards the third act they started to become incredibly uninteresting and felt recycled. The problem with basing your entire movie around one monster with a couple of gimmicks is it becomes INCREDIBLY old very quickly; there's only so much you can do with that limited set, alongside the fact that they break all so many established rules and stop making much sense throughout the movie. I don't know much about budgeting for animation but if A Quiet Place Part 2 could pull off what it did with a budget of 61 million, I struggle to see how you can justify a 200 million budget for one monster with two variations (one type has a red belly and a couple of owies on her face. OH! And they recycled that too). I'll admit that it must have taken a long time to animate the amount of scenes that they're in (a lot more than other films like a quiet place p2) but 200 million dollars worth of animation?I REALLY want to say the acting in this was bad, but I feel like the main falling point of this movie is the script and directing, the actors did a good job with poor material. I guess the animation and actor budget took all of the funds from the writing and directing departments. There was an abundance of scenes that were supposed to be serious but had me in stitches from the sheer stupidity of them. There was just too many scenes that were meant to be funny but were just pointless cringey to me (granted that's subjective). Finally the film takes way too liberal use of ""Movie logic"" and both big and small things make no sense and are just contradictory. I'm probably expecting too much from this but for a 200 million budget, I'd expect a film that doesn't insult the viewer's intelligence, but the amount of recycled and pointless material just becomes mind numbing.Last but definitely not least, the AUDIO! The musical score is great, Lorne Balfe never really disappoints me. In fact, I think the score was so good and gave the movie so much substance, that it was all the audio techs wanted you to hear! Seriously, unless you want to give yourself tinnitus, don't try to listen to the dialogue during action scenes, because the music and foley are so blaring that you need your volume turned waaaaay up to hear anything else. It's almost like Chris Mckay knew they it was bad and wanted to drown it out.I feel like this movie is rated too highly (6.7 as of writing this knit-picky review) for its budget, or just too highly in general. But hey it's still better than anything I could produce, probably with the same budget.",The Tomorrow War

I thought it was creative and took some very bold and unique choices that added to the realism of something this fantastical.And the emotional twist was just too endearing and addicting - maybe that's because of my unique relationship with my own daughter.I can't wait to watch this movie again and be more fully invested now that I know it delivers from start to finish.

I enjoyed it overall anyway, but of course IF Dan Forester had gone back in time and in any way prevented the Whitespikes from awaking and destroying everything, none of it would have happened, INCLUDING his daughter discovering how to kill them, and therefore it all would have still happened, et cetera ad infinitum.The fact that it still happened in the world of fiction, enough to give us the idea that it all happened SO THAT it didn't have to happen... satisfies me in a way I can only explain as a sort of meta timeline in a loop-de-loop.",The Tomorrow War

3271,wordsnmind,Great summer movie but...,7,8 July 2021,"I'm not a huge fan of time travel. Its messy and the stories never get fleshed out enough for me. I was for the most part satisfied with the way they handled the time travel. They avoided paradox by sending soldiers in based on their date of death. And since everyone was slated to die in that in the timestream it was okay to reveal how things could be changed in the past if it meant preventing humankind's annihilation. And considering they only stay in the future for 7 days, it felt like they could somehow redeem themselves if they should be fortunate enough to return. The problem I have with this is ""how did Dan go to the war twice and make it back twice?"" Does time travel work on a loop like that? Because if everybody died then how did his daughter call.him back in after he died in ther past. I have to take a star. I liked the premise that something man caused causes this war because that means it can possibly be dealt with as well.There was a great deal of diversity cast in this movie which lends to the other premise that we all have to work together to stop an extinction event. The action was good but somewhat predictable in alot of scenes. I probably would have rated the movie higher if not for the neverending plot fixture where the white man saves the day because he has self-serving motives. But he redeems himself through forgiveness of his father. The use of his public school students to help solve a major problem was refreshing as you don't come across too many young black kids super interested and knowledgable in ancient volcanoes.The twist about his daughter (I should have but didnt see coming) was kind of derivative but it works if you ignore the time travel conundrum. And we know that this is a play on Independence day. But it feels different because of the way this war started. It was less fighting for our independence and more like a reckoning because their children needed them to deal with problems created and perpetuated in the present day. Since those problems were not dealt before they came back and asked for help, with they have no future.All in all it was a good story with a satisfying ending even with the gaping plot holes.",The Tomorrow War

3287,carsoncollierusa,"Good Premise, Terrible Execution",1,10 July 2021,"First, let me start off by saying that I don't really like syfi movies if they are too cheesy. I don't care how much action or how cool they are, if they don't really make sense and have tons of plot holes (foreshadowing) I don't like them. This movie is the epitome of that. I was intrigued by the premise and thought it'd be cool, but I was disappointed. This review isn't even going to talk about the tons of plot holes this movie has, just the technical stuff.1) My main problem is the pacing. I've read reviews and they said pacing is good, its not. It's very inconsistent. Chris Pratt is drafted in the first 15 minutes of the movie (which I don't mind, it just happens too fast in comparison to the rest of the movie, we could've spend more time on this rather than dragged out action sequences, doing this would've also made the homecoming of Chris Pratt that much more emotional). Basic training through the first mission is fine, pacing is a bit slow during the mission, but I don't mind because I was loving the suspense of the monster reveal. Right after the first mission is where the movie became practically unwatchable and it wasn't even half way over. Now they go to capture the female. All they had to do was shoot and sedate her to get her in the cage before she can call the males, but instead we spend like 10 minutes before she even thinks to call the males on pointless action. The she then calls them and we get this action sequence of the males chasing them that shouldn't of even happened in the first place that lasts another 5 minutes. Then they drive to the beach and are no longer being chased by the males, before SHOOTING OFF A FLARE and having an ""emotional"" conversation (basically giving us all the information about Chris Pratt the future daughter withheld for suspense?) without the males coming and killing them that takes up another 10 minutes. Then after this we get another stupidly long scene of them trying to figure out the weakness of the female which is ridiculous (for a reason I'll talk about in my second point) then the female calls the males again and the males attack which is fine in the beginning (I regained my interest at this point) but slows down too much and tries to get emotional in the middle of the adrenaline packed event. Then the action picks up and he is sent back to the past. The only thing I liked about it taking so long was that when he came back to the rioting 2022 after his week long tour, it really felt like a week had pasted. Then after he gets back they figure out everything, like the whole mystery of where the white spikes are in 2022 IN LIKE 10 MINUTES. Then they fly to Russia and the climax takes like 30 minutes and drags on when Chris Pratt legit starts fighting this alien with his bare hands after it was killing dozens of armed people earlier in the film.2) My second main problem is the relationship between Chris Pratt and his future daughter. His daughter is a jerk to him even though he loved her and wasn't the same man she called father yet. He, at that point in time, hadn't done anything to her yet and she treats him like garbage. Then she begins to like him when they're finding the females weakness, but then she doesn't and then she does. She is very bi-polar and even admits while she is dying that she enjoyed seeing his past self because it reminded her of ""the way things used to be"" THEN WHY SPEND ALL THAT TIME HATING HIM?? This just shows the atrocious writing, this being one of many continuity errors.3) I also kind of got annoyed at the comedy. Like I don't mind if there is comedy, but it needed to be slid in at better times. The comic relief in particular is so bad and gets on my nerves, like most of it is actually funny and made me laugh, but they're not the times to make jokes. One PRIME example being the climactic scene where the alien dies. Right after it's killed J. K Simmons cracks a joke about Chris Pratt telling the alien to die. Its funny and delivered excellently by J. K, but its not the time for it. To add on to this, practically every piece of information is given through dialog and the ""show not tell"" method is completely abandoned. Once again, very amateur writing.Now there are a few things I liked. The CGI was done well and the white spikes were pretty scary. I enjoyed Terry (the guy who went on like 3 tours and kept the souvenirs). They should've expounded more on him or just made him the main character, following his journey from being one of the first drafted and to kill a white spike to the ending of the war thanks to his souvenirs, while battling with the notion that he was gonna die from cancer throughout it all if he were to somehow survive the war. Sounds like a much better movie if you ask me.Overall 100% do not recommend, it was a waste and had such an inflated run time, I was practically falling asleep during most if it. I didn't most mention most of the plot holes it had and my review was still pretty harsh. If you're looking to go into film as a career like I am, take notes, this is how not to make a film.",The Tomorrow War

Completely does not follow any actual scientific principles of time travel. Way too many paradoxes. Which even using split reality theory, should be touched on the even briefly to make it feel more genuine. Also the so called aliens of the film (although briefly suggested to have been sent as a weapon) are way to unsophisticated to both travel through space; let alone wipe out humanity with teeth and claws.

Sure there guns never run out of ammo and it's noticeable but WHO CARES. The plot was interesting enough to keep me off my phone and entertained the whole time. The cast was stacked and very well chosen in my opinion. There was emotion and action that truly entertained me. I generally find movies like this kinda dumb, but this one was just very well made in my opinion. Some reviews said it was confusing, I'm sorry but if this was confusing you shouldn't be writing a review they set it very clearly. Sure it's got some kinda almost cringe moments but overall very entertaining and I would recommend to anyone. So long as you aren't looking for a movie with some complex super artistic plot.

It has it's moments that get on your nerves but enjoyed it.Spoilers ahead:
A few things I think the movie could've done better
I absolutely loved it until Dan met muri at the camp, though that was a major part it takes away from the whole action-eu theme and adds a badly done dramatic aspect into the mix. Muri was overly dramatic and despite the obvious bond they have it was all too much. Muri was an annoying character throughout, never seeming to decide on anything nd got zero sympathy from me.-The final section of the movie seriously ruined it. All that build-up for what? An incredibly clichéd and cringe worthy ending, especially with useless characters like the kid that knew about the volcanoes. It was all too convenient and everything seemed to just happen to snap in place.They could've continued with the whole alien story ( I personally found it dope) but instead with an elite task force or something with Dan, Charlie and Dan's father included.",The Tomorrow War
3302,grfratzke,Eye rolling,3,11 July 2021,"The logic of the plot is so ridiculous it becomes insulting toward the end. It is really astounding what passes for a blockbuster script these days. This felt a lot like the original Independence Day, which also relied heavily on the charm of its cast and good cgi, but without the comic relief; and frankly the cast was not as charming, but these actors are good at their craft. No character depth, no quotable moments. This isn't really a spoiler, but the apparent ""moral"" of the story is that a popular, attractive, healthy, intelligent, employed father with a beatiful wife (who seems intelligent in her own right - but again, no character depth on which to make the assumption) and a loving, intelligent, beautiful healthy daughter, living in a nice Miami suburban home was not happy with his life until he realizes after going through hell that everything he always wanted was right in front of him all along 🙄.

Enter the introduction. A sports game with a team of people from the future suddenly teleporting in, stating that in less than a year, aliens invade, and that 30 years in the future, mankind is losing that war. So they start sending large groups of people 28 years into the future, where 80% of them don't survive.This is followed by a father talking to his daughter about what the brain needs. Oxygen.. moving onto him or someone else teaching in a college environment, something similar.I gave up at that point and I don't think I was even 10 minutes in.So from the above, let's explain the poor logistics. Instead of sending tech back 30 years and having people train with it before the aliens arrive, we are going to send unskilled soldiers and civilians into the future to die for a dead end cause because they don't know the first thing about warfare, are not soldiers and so on.We can also expect that the aliens have some issue with Co2, which is why the blatantly obvious plot focus has given attention to it. My guess would be that the aliens are defeated by something involving Co2 and perhaps a virus.

Action in this film was full of life and believe me Chris Pratt was really looking like an officer who's fought in wars.

Not only is it under attack but humanity has almost been wiped out (some 500,000 remaining) and pretty much all human society has been laid to waste.Somehow, even considering the near total annihilation of humanity, future humans have built a time machine and have travelled to our time to ask that we send our people to fight this war which is already lost for all intents and purposes.For some reason, that seems like the logical thing to do, so we end up sending hundreds of thousands to die in this war which we have no chance of winning (and no reason to, everything is destroyed).Instead of.. I don't know, maybe just stopping the war from happening in the first place??? 20/20 hindsight is a hell of a thing, but apparently not in this movie.So of course, we cant save future Earth and end up doing just that, stopping the war from ever happening in the present.

3342,museanielrule,"I'm all for climate action, but this was not it.",4,19 July 2021,"The entire movie is a metaphor for climate change and the 'war' that faces us in the future. Much to my discomfort, I actually liked the idea of forcing the ooold people to fix the problem they created, but that was near the extent of my admiration for this film. Besides that, I also liked the subtle foreshadowing in the film, for example the 2.4 degree temperature increase screen while Chris Pratt is teaching.Prefacing my despise for this film: I understand that the film is as exaggerated as possible as to get a social justice message across to less informed viewers.Now, for the slamming.Playing with time travel never really goes well. An emotional climax of the movie resides in the death of his daughter in the future *she sacrifices her life to get antidotes to the past. However, her dying wish would also be the reason for her to live. I had no emotional attachment to her because she basically saved herself. The logic of the film is much more than fallible. I also found it quite patronising when they attempted to explain wormholes, the job was half assed and wasn't all that realistic - again, don't mess with time travel, especially in a shallow movie.Besides the theory behind the film, the actual content was dull besides some small sparks. I quite enjoyed Chris's acting even though it's the role he is always asked to play, ""Chris Pratt and throw in some goo gaas"" - unreliable quote from Community. However, besides this the directing and cinematography was quite horrible. The story seemed like it was missing some pieces and I felt as if they had often skipped time without jimming the audience. It felt almost as if they had made a 4 hour long movie, and decided, 4 hours is too much. So they proceeded to cut out random bits from the film in order to trim time. This made the movie feel rushed. Perfect example of this was the escape from the white claws after extraction failed (with the 6 vials), they kind of cut up random bits and uncomfortably cut from runaway to stock video of cool aliens for rollercoaster moviegoers. This was coupled with some of the worst immersion cinematography i've seen. Personally -and this is not due to an immunity of fear- the creatures were not scary. This was because I felt like I was never immersed. The first scene that introduces the scary spooky monsters on the stairwell was actually funny to me. Not one scene actually visualises any of the actors with the cgi monsters. It's like they wanted a shortcut and felt like editing shots with actors would be too hard. This left you with 5 minutes of cutting from monsters to Chris Pratt's face... back and forth and so on and so on. It was the least exhilarating moment of the show.Concluding this: the show had potential, but was rushed, would not recommend, just stop climate change because it's a real thing.",The Tomorrow War

So overall don't expect it to be the best with the story it isn't, its quite mediocre.But if you're a action enthusiast, then I think its worth your time. So sit back get a drink, popcorn and enjoy.",The Tomorrow War
3344,cimdreamer,Best sci-fi movie in a long time!,10,19 July 2021,"This was soooooo good! There was action, mystery, a really good plot with interesting science and suspense with a great message but also some hilarious lines! The characters were awesome and the plot and twists really good! It kept you guessing and rooting for them the entire time and did not feel like a two hour movie. The aliens were super creepy and they did an excellent job with them and the whole dynamic with them which I won't spoil. It was really, really one of the best sci-fi action movies since probably the classic Alien movie. Just superb.",The Tomorrow War

No this is not as good as aliens or equally as good as aliens but MUCH better than expected!I saw this movie through Amazon Prime and believe me, there are some incredibly, extremely painful, horrible movies was horrible acting, terrible directing, painful special effects. You won't see that in this movie. I've seen similar to this genre...If you're looking for some great action and some good acting and really great special effects ($200 million budget)...

3347,maymax-17376,Fair warning; the movie is cheesy but actually kinda cool,7,19 July 2021,"This is by no means an ""Alien"" or ""The Thing"" grade movie. I found a lot of the dialogue and set up to be a somewhat corny throughout the movie. So please don't have your expectations really high when you give this a chance. You're going to see a lot of cliches from various well known movies like the family aspect, personal growth, creating friendships, apocalypse scenario, action sequences, and a monster to name a few. I feel like this movie took a lot of (good) pieces from a lot of favorite action/thriller/alien type movies but they stitched it together in their own unique way. Chris Pratt is amazing as always. One other thing I find redeeming was the development of their monster. I can tell they spent a lot of time designing the perfect killing machine with unique features that reminds you of multiple real life predators all in one. They did an amazing job creating an original monster that was effective in looking as foreign, dangerous, and strong alien whose sole purpose is to kill. Again, cheesy storyline with lots of plot holes (but what can you expect from a time travel movie? They all have plot holes) but the unveiling of the alien backstory was interesting and I really enjoyed how the story unfolded. This is definitely the kind of movie you'll probably only see once or twice but I personally don't think it's a waste of time. It's hard to get over scientific inaccuracies but if you ignore the logic and just run with the story it's actually not too bad. So that's my ""fair warning"". This is not the best movie you'll ever see so do not set your expectations high at all. But it's not terrible, it's far from a grade B film, and the story is captivating. Just go in with logic aside and run with it. If you can't get over some of the things I mentioned (like the cheesy acting or dialogue, scientific inaccuracies, etc) then you will either hate this movie or find it completely amusing because of all the things you can point out and say ""what?! If they just did this then that would never have happened""",The Tomorrow War

However, for what her role was, she portrayed it fantastically. I would have liked to see more of her character's role developed.The overall movie kept me interested for the most part throughout its duration.

Like the ships cargo however, the plot is annoyingly riddled with holes.Under the guise of all the cheese and shooting, the film's real purpose is to deliver one flimsily-veiled message: We need action on climate change, and our political structures are incapable of achieving it.Four stars for packaging an important message in a language that anyone can understand.",The Tomorrow War

The plot becomes ridiculous at the end. The script was awful. Another example of style over substance gone terribly wrong. While its expected that films portraying the fantastic will have unrealistic scenes and unrealistic actions by the characters, this film went too far. At the very least, humans should behave like humans and I am fairly certain that most of the untrained ""civilian-soldiers"" would have fainted, defecated themselves, screamed/cried/gone fetal, had a sudden 'coronary event' or a combination of all the above upon (a) being shot into the future such as they were, (b) being dropped onto the top of a building in an apocalyptic war zone in an extremely violent manner, (c) seeing alien monsters eating other humans, or (d) simply seeing an alien monster for the first time. Forget about being ready to fight alien monsters under extremely distressing combat conditions that they had zero preparation and/or training for.

However, the sad truth is: this cannot be said about the movie itself.I was not expecting a masterful storyline, mindblowing dialogues or even mildly creative ideas. Just a solid piece of action, with lots of guns and explosions. On which it delivered. But a story with countless logical flaws lined up one after each other? With the biggest flaw set as the foundation of the movie itself? Rendering the whole 'reason' for the action part unbelievable and unacceptable? No, thank you. The authors seemed to have wanted to patch this central hole after two thirds of the movie, just to let this patch go to waste and finish with another absurd turn of events, leaving the viewer behind with a feeling of disappointment.No, I cannot recommend this movie at all. So why did it still get three stars in the end?

When the movie finally get started it appears to extend every scene with so much cgi-pow-wow that one perhaps shall forget that there's no real plot. And as many have pointed out already, the lack of rational logic in the plot should by now have left most completely brain numb. And then there's the divined solution, the alien/toxin parallel with covid/vaccine which is perhaps subtle but still undeniable, fully exposed in the protein match/sequencing scene that is accompanied by glorious military music going on and on to culminate with a near perfect percentage match (it surprised me they went to 100% and didn't cut it at 95% though...) Add to that a lot of too long irrelevant gap fillers and a grand finale that leaves you wondering what the political angle was to bring Russia in to the story, and the absurd idea that the alien invasion happened only because of the global climate change....

The scene where soldiers from the future enter a football pitch started an exciting and interesting story for me.But something I cant get over is the illogical strategy. Not talking about the paradox of timetraveling, Im talking about how illogical the plan to save humanity from extinction is. We got a toxin that kills the male alien creatures, but it doesnt work on the female one. There is only 1 female alien creature and killing her would mean the end of their species. So why do we humans try to catch the female alive to make a toxin that kill her? We could have just blow up her nest! After putting her in a cage we even had her chained up and sedated. A machinegun, a grenade, an axe or even a kitchen knife would have ended the war. So why spend so much resources on developing a toxin to kill her? Did I missunderstand something?If the plan by the future solders all the time was to kill that female creature before things became a war, then would the intel of where these creature first attacked be important? Instead Muri shared this intel to her dad as if it wasnt of any importance, as if she has come to a conclusion there is no way to stop this before the aliens first attack.Even though illogical, still a very entertaining movie and I dont regret spending time on this movie. I would have paid to watch this movie in the cinemas if not for the pandemic restrictions. Cheers!",The Tomorrow War
3434,gimlisbeard,The biggest issue is the story...,2,4 July 2021,"Great action scenes, Chris Pratt was great as were all the actors but the HUGE story holes can't be ignored.Spoilers ahead.Main story holds that Pratt's character has to bring back to his time a serum to destroy the aliens before they destroy humanity. Problem - they don't actually even need the serum. The whole thing would have been tied up easily by just blowing up the alien ship and then holding the serum for future use if one escaped or if more came to earth. But otherwise, the serum was literally a useless device in the story.The story would have worked better if the adult Muri had an advanced degree in geology and worked with the character Charlie with Dan jumping in as pseudo leader and motivator. The fact that it rested on a 16 year old kid in high school liking volcanoes was just silly. It would have worked better if it the Chinese volcano bit was a flashback from class discussion and then have Charlie and Muri go further with it. Then the fact that they just kind of turn up in the middle of Siberia on snowmobiles seems far fetched to say the least.The story just ruined the movie in so many ways because it wasn't at all plausible. It's like someone that doesn't really like scifi decided to write a script for an action movie assuming the audience is too stupid to figure out how implausible the storyline is. There were so many easy ways to have this movie this make sense and have even more action scenes, but they went the dumb and stupid route. Even in scifi - the story needs to make sense in the world that it resides in.",The Tomorrow War
3435,diginomics,Jurassic Park meets Aliens II,9,4 July 2021,"Even if the world is going to end the basic human instinct to run, when all is lost, save those who are counted upon to be naturally courageous. Not so here when a swarm of avenging beasts angered by their caged queen come sweeping down into the gorge! No panic sets in and soldiers stands firm (to be eaten) allowing the greater success of the mission to win through.Casual self-sacrifice is played down as befits the telling of heroics. A good film sound track propels this ""Jurassic Park meets Aliens II"" into something very original. I believe it will stand the test of time, a classic, for a cinematic breakthrough here comes discretely in the clever form of the alien CGI quality. Our threatened extinction is counter-balanced by time-shift technology. Mankind's last stand ""knitted assembly"" includes a sea fort operating a pulsating blue energy antenna to jump time. Step into the blue light.A critic might point out our future humans fail to sensibly select their choice of arms. However that is a robust decision as we want to believe for good to triumph you need plenty of gun fire! The suspense of disbelief works solely because our focus is upon the aliens. If it did not we would ask why rudimentary fleshy creatures, reptilian armored or not, without the advantage of force-fields or other technologies could withstand simple logic? Why not arm your draft conscripts with weapons readily available in their own time that can destroy heavily armored tanks? We do not and it would be a poor cinematic experience otherwise.We believe the combat premise as it is portrayed, albeit with the illogical fire arms limit. We want to accept the gruesome, carnivorous beauty of these CGI beasts in their full glory and the hand-to-hand combat. The use of fly-by-wire or anti-tank weapons are anti-climatic in the viewing sense and nukes not mentioned for like reason. Instead we get a safari style picture aerial shot of this majestic nemesis of mankind hunting down in packs wild horses for food, just as they do humans. It permits us to enjoy dramatic and prolonged use of rapid fire as a practical solution.The sci-fi story successfully stays within the bounds of reality just enough to make a very good movie. Within its technical confine the excitement revolves around the typical story telling of supernatural courage and a final search for a biological solution to save mankind. The central tale is family drama between a father who ""must find himself"" and his young daughter. They play out sensitively against a time-shift story to give pathos and meaning. Certainly worth watching again although the visceral aliens best kept quiet.",The Tomorrow War

The government doesn't care that he brought a toxin, yet anyone in their right mind would have mass produced it to be prepared and calm the population. Nor does anyone care that they could eliminate the aliens immediately.Then the bunch of wise guys stands in front of the spaceship and decides to go inside instead of calling for the largest reinforcement in Earth's history or the someone delivering a nuclear carpet bombing. Once inside, of course, they screw up again. Instead of blowing it up immediately, they start applying the poison to each alien individually, screw up and then almost cause the worlds annihilation themselves. That part was cringe worthy!Again: If you like SciFi/Action movies, still definitely worth watching.",The Tomorrow War

3479,Arrimdb,"No time travel issues - My own insight on the ""plot holes""",7,11 July 2021,"To start off, I love time travel stories. And honestly, I don't see any problems with the plot (more details below), but I do see a problem in how little they bother to explain things and how the characters, with main key information, are conveniently involved with the main character.I've read of two main talking points that are overly critized. The time travel issue and the ending. This is my insight on those.About the time travel: there's nothing wrong with this film's time travel plot, but it's not well explained, in my opinion. The film's only tips about how it works are: time travels in a one-way flow (this explains what kind of time travel concept it's basing off) and the device they created only allows people who were dead in the ""future"" to travel to the ""future"" (this is pretty much a premise of the device, so it's hard to argue against).Let's call the ""future"" world (with future Muri) Alpha, and the ""past"" world (with alive Dan), Beta. When they say that it's a one-way flow, it means that you can never go from future(Alpha) to past(Alpha). It also means that, by travelling from future(Alpha) to past(Beta), you are never creating paradoxes, as they are both flowing forward. Beta will always be the world where people from Alpha time-travelled to, as well as Alpha will always be the world where the aliens invaded 30 years later. A single flow.Thus, there is nothing wrong with Dan saying he wants to save both his world and future Muri. That would have just meant saving both Alpha and Beta (again, different timelines, always flowing forward, unrelated to one another).And then about the ending, and how he decided, after being rejected by the American government, to take matters into his own hands and eliminated the aliens with a small steam, it also makes sense. Just imagine: if any government realizes there are a lethal species lying dormant (and that will remain dormant) for the next 30 years, isn't there a chance they might stealthily keep specimens alive, for future warfare? How about research groups, who might want them to study further? And they mention the UN, don't you think there would be a lot of opposition over the extinction of a species? It was definitely a reckless decision, but I wouldn't say baseless. (they definitely could've prepared better though, like creating bullets containing the toxin, instead of just injectable syringes).I wouldn't give this film a better rating since, when you're making this kind of movie, you are expected to take the time to explain the mechanisms involved in it (even if it was already more than 2 hours long and more focused on action). And, well, also the unending ammo clips, convenient ""protagonist shields"" for never getting hit, and random ""eurekas"", but those are kind of expected I guess.",The Tomorrow War

When he does return to the past it takes a conversation with his wife to generate the idea to form a rag tag team of fortuitously gifted acquaintances to kill the aliens before they hatch ..... It's as of the world powers suddenly became completely uninterested in stopping the war before it started because people were rioting....

3508,tonks_grace345,Worth to watch at least 2 times,9,6 July 2021,"First off, I have learned to enjoy a movie is not to read the plot summary, articles related to the movie, possibly just watch the trailers once. So, mind you, I just didn't have a preconceived notion how it has to happen in my head, basically just following the flow of the movie.Spoilers ahead:
For this movie, I love how it was written. How plausible this war can be between aliens and us. It's not like a war can end in like 3 days?! The writer didn't dumb down the dialog or scenes. I love how they managed to put together the important tidbits for the movie and remove the dragging parts. Now I've read some user reviews and they say that they are confused at the end, better watch it the second time and the third time. It's all in there especially when it comes to the story of the future daughter. All I can say that it is plausible at that scene it is a flipping high anxiety last few minutes in the future, Dan Forester would be forgiven to blurt promises to his daughter. Like I said watch it more times it's in Amazon Prime.For the effects of the aliens, I may not be a solid hard-core science fiction movie fan but I can't say I'm a noob either, I do wanted to watch this in theatres based on the fear factor and goosebumps. Well done with how the CGI people chose how the movement of the aliens had to be, being aggressive, they must have watched how predator animals hunt and kill(it is a small scene in the movie in Miami). Not the most original aliens look but it is well fitted for this movie.The characters have all been well casted in my opinion. It has enough chemistry whether the actors are playing off each other as getting to know each other, parent-child interaction, tension when needed and just thr right banter to diffuse the tension. Oh yes, I am so glad they represented actors with amputated limbs I found out. It's not CGI'd -- it is the details that count.It's been awhile I've felt that hype of watching a movie especially in our time where streaming is available. Usually after watching an premier movie in a streaming site, I would say like ""...makes it was not shown in theatre.."" but this is worth it.",The Tomorrow War

The acting, CGI, and pacing of the film was amazing. Even my family loved every minute of it, and we all gasped and cheered at the same time.This film in one word is satisfying. No lazy story telling, you get a good idea about each character before any of the action even starts. The film itself cuts no corners and gives the viewer a full satisfying story which is hard to find these days in big blockbuster movies. They could've easily made this film into three parts as most recent films do, but chose producing a complete thorough product, instead of a money-grabbing franchise.I've given the film a 10 rating which might seem generous but the amount of negative reviews is absurd!

3528,baugh_man,"A solid ""Meh""",5,14 July 2021,"First of all, I totally predicted that Yvonne Strahovski's character was going to be Chris Pratt's daughter in the future after seeing the trailer once. If that was meant to be some mind-blowing plot-twist, then it failed miserably.The overall plot of aliens from the future killing everything has been done over and over again, but it never felt at all intense or scary. Part of this, I think, is because the aliens are almost always seen in broad daylight. You can add a ton more suspense by just not showing the aliens like that and focusing on the humans' fear.The way these totally untrained ""soldiers"" were fighting in an urban warfare setting was a complete joke. They'd be shooting each other by accident, if they could even figure out how to chamber a round and turn off the safety.Also, give the aliens SOME sort of weakness to make them more believable. I mean, they're super fast, able to crawl up walls, don't seem to mind being shot a bunch, can shoot spikes, swim incredibly fast, and apparently have no problem being in freezing temperatures.Anyway, it was entertaining enough that I actually finished the movie while running on the treadmill, but I definitely won't bother watching again.

3540,Sejian,I can't get over how many of these low rating reviews appear to have watched a different movie.,10,13 July 2021,"10/10 to balance those very low reviews that complain about the points listed further down. 7/10 or 7.5/10 is appropriate.Does everyone just accept Marty McFly-esque time travel plots and discard Smart Hulk-esque time travel plots?*SPOILERS*A few points to consider, as I've seen mentioned:1. It is never confirmed by any of the future characters that altering the past will change *their* future. The dialog gets murky at times but it is never stated, and therefore, should not be assumed. This is not a loop, nor does it claim to be a loop. Stop assuming everything is a paradoxical loop for Pete's sake!2. When future-Muri tells Dan the plan, we're expected to be paying attention and realize that the future soldiers already executed this plan even before jumping back in time. The plan isn't to win the war in the future. The plan is to delay the aliens as long as possible til they can synthesize a solution to then send back so past humanity doesn't suffer extinction. My view is that this plan requires throwing as many bodies as possible between their last stronghold and the aliens to buy time. They sacrificed people from the past in order to save the past people's future. Not. Theirs. Get it?3. The toxin was created to be sent back in time so the past could mass produce it to combat the aliens when they ""arrived"". It was not intended for Dan's strike team into Russia because...4. ...the future did not know where or when the aliens came from, just that they appeared one day and started killing everything. ""But there were no ships. There was no satellite footage of any rockets, nothing. They searched everything. They couldn't find it."" which brings us back to point number 3. They made a toxin because they had no other viable solution...5. ...and no time to strategize one. It is stated more than once, if I remember correctly, that the future soldiers believe they are living on borrowed time. They're not looking to waste time coming up with another plan when extinction is staring them in the face.6. For everyone complaining that time travel in this movie doesn't work the way they want it to: ""The Jumplink doesn't work that way. [...] We've barely managed to make one very rudimentary wormhole. If we weren't in an extinction-level event, we'd still be jumping lab rats."" Explained 32 minutes in.7. ""Time only flows in one direction. [...] we can jump back and forth between them, but both rafts will always keep moving forward."" Meaning every minute that passes in the past, also passes in the future. Explained 31 minutes in.Points 6 and 7 are really for those people who are simply unwilling to accept that this movie does not treat time travel the way other movies do. I don't get it. We complain that Hollywood keeps recycling ideas, then complain when the idea presented goes against the accepted recycled idea.8. The future plan was Need-to-Know which did not include telling past government, military, or civilians. This is hinted at by the responses Dan's questions when he was selected and R Force's questions about what the enemy looked like. Of course they're not going to tell you that you're being sacrificed to buy time! Duh!9. Future soldiers ultimately sacrificed themselves to save the past's future. My view is that yes, they could've saved themselves by traveling back in time, but what would that achieve? They synthesized the toxin just before their extinction. The only way they were able to do this was by capturing a female, which they achieved less than a day before their extinction. They did not discover the origin of the aliens in their timeline and they had no time to sit around trying to figure it out any longer, nor could they take the chance that the past would be prepared even with their arguably limited knowledge about the aliens.I have not logged into IMVU in quite a long time, but these low reviews and nonsensical complaints needed addressing. No, it isn't a groundbreaking masterpiece, but it's competent, entertaining, and follows a more logical theory of time travel (personal preference) similar to Avengers: Endgame.Also, The Tomorrow War is a better alternate timeline Alien prequel than the Alien prequels.",The Tomorrow War

3553,jessiejanson,"The first half was great, then someone started cutting important scenes.",6,14 September 2021,"From start to the middle of the movie, the movie was great, excellent in every way and could easily be seen as a soon to be scifi classic that could potentially spawn additional movies.Then as the movie progresses it becomes clear that some scenes were skipped over and left out of the film because you are left wondering ""why didnt they do THIS"" and then later you are shown things that indicate they in fact did do THAT. I was left wondering ""Why would they cut out a scene that would have taken about 10 seconds to film"" And i get the distinct feeling the scene was meant to be much longer and was probably filmed and they simply cut out the entire 10 minute or longer scene after filming was complete to reduce run time for the film. As a result they couldnt go back and fix the scene and just figured ""well nobody will notice"" Except the scene was so critical, there is no way anyone would have missed it. Its a big mistake but one you can look past.However something similar happens again and characters seemingly ignore a massive problem that there is simply no way anyone would ignore, it makes no sense whatsoever. This movie has a talented writer, and there is no doubt a talented writer could have solved this problem, but it again seems like a chunk of the script was just cut out, or perhaps at about the halfway filmed point they decided ""this movie is getting too long, lets just cut this other stuff from the script and rush it, well just focus more on action and nobody will notice"". Except its impossible to not notice.These two massive errors Sink this movie from a 5 star to a 3, or 10 to a 6. Only the exceptionally well done first half saves the rating. If the entire movie had been of the quality of the last half, this movie would have been a 1-2 star film.There are not many great sci fi movies and so many people still enjoyed it by ignoring the 2 major problems. I had a hard time getting past it, my family didnt mind and loved it regardless, and others on here simply hate the film for having done it and will bash it on random things because they are angry and i cant blame them. Its hard to see such a great film get butchered because someone was worried about run time and wanted it 20 minutes shorter.

3560,tarik-644-831968,Lack of logic is distracting,5,5 July 2021,"Let me first say, I was thoroughly entertained, hence the 6.But the plot holes and lack of logic was unlike any movie I've ever seen of this budget. Some examples:Mind you, literal *all of humanity* is at stake.The toxin ended up being useless. If they literally spent 5 seconds analysing a claw, saw the ash, traced it to Russia (all of which they did at the end regardless of the toxin), went there and blew up the ship, the movie was done. These steps were literally taken by random people including a high school student and a high school teacher and his dad. Oh, and the teacher's wife got him the idea that they may have been there before the year of the attack...I mean I can end my post right here, that's just a joke. Is it secretly satire, a parody?They send ""thousands"" of overweight people without training, armour or grenades into the future with handguns every week. And then they take them out after a week. Remember the stakes here. Why not send tanks. Trained people. More people. Better gear. Why not leave them for more than a week?The US alone literally has 2 million prisoners locked up for worldly crimes (e.g. Stealing a watch) for context, 140 million humans are born every year, but the planet only sends a few thousand soldiers per week to prevent humanity's annihilation. You'd think to prevent annihilation of the human race, you'd involve at least as many people as world war II (let alone III).Only people who will die in the future get sent, that's why only some are chosen. Makes sense, if you forget in the future only 500k are left, aka. 0.007% of the population is still alive. The other 99.993% can be sent no problem, aka virtually everyone.The dad is chosen to bring back the toxin, why him and why the toxin? Remember literal humanity is at stake. The 7 billion people of 2020 thought to send a high school teacher with ZERO intel, instead of say, a team of US Navy Seals and Harvard biologists, to contain a female, extract samples and bring them home for study with 30 years left.The dad literally jumps to his death after his daughter. There's zero chance of them surviving that, so it's useless. Yet in doing so, he's willing to condemn the entire human race to annihilation, if the jump back to the past was just 5 seconds later (according to the plot that pretended him going back with the toxin was the only solution). Come. On. Besides, even if he did save her, the moment he goes back to prevent the creatures, that timeline is wiped anyway.Timing bs. Of course they spent 10 years getting the toxin. The moment they get it, after 99.997% of the population is dead, the last vestige of humanity gets attacked by a million creatures, and a few seconds before being overrun the highschool teacher jumps back. Moments later the portal closes permanently. Sure.The highschool teacher, his dad, and his researcher friend turned soldier (who a day before just hid) go into a spaceship and ended up letting out a bunch of creatures including a female because they insist on killing it with toxins, instead of just placing C4 and walking away.The movie ends with the highschool teacher fighting this thing in hand to hand combat, again, to prevent the annihilation of the human race. This includes taking a knife to the throat, instead of say, the gun that he had. It also includes an icepick to the eyeball, also instead of the gun. It ends with the creature falling down a mountain on its armoured back (which took 5000 rounds) and splashing into a million pieces.Finally none of the emotions or humour made sense. They're literally laughing and making corny jokes minutes after their entire squad died. It destroys the entire idea of there being anything at stake.",The Tomorrow War

Creates all sorts of time travel paradoxes if you take it seriously; but solves them all through the silly multi-verse concept if you take it lightly.Acting could have been better and the story had room for tightening. I ended up fast forwarding some parts; there was quite a bit of fluff that could have been trimmed. The movie was much longer than it needed to be.There were also many convenient coincidences throughout the move for the plot to move along (e.g. The student super into volcanos; a hero with a claw necklace on the same team; an engineering professor who happens to have earth science background).Chris P is his usual self; reliably delivering his lines and handsome looks. His hair seems to have been dyed black or dark brown - it was a little hard to recognize him at first.It is a good movie to kill some time, nothing more, nothing less.

3584,dkmdkm2012,Unexplored Ideas lead to Uninspired Action Flick,6,3 July 2021,"I enjoyed this somewhat. Shooting, explosions, weird sci-fi tech; It had all the expected action movie beats.There were a few stand-out scenes in it which I thought were really cool.1) The reveal of the monster in the stairwell. The rapid breathing, the heartbeats, the close shot, and the disgusting creature design made it seem especially terrifying. Excellent found-footage feel.2) The reveal of the crashed ship and the interior of it were awesome.3) the human oil-rig-science-base contraption was also really cool.Unfortunately I think this movie just fell a little flat for me. There were things I thought were alluded too that might happen that just ended up being a bit confusing since they were not acted upon.1) why couldn't the humans from the future find the space-ship or study the creatures and determine they had the ash from that volcanic eruption prior to the intervention of Chris Pratt?2) Why did they bother creating these injectable toxins and the syringe guns when they could just as easily have blown everything up from the beginning?3) Why did the other aliens in the, for lack of a better word, placentas, wake up when they started injecting their mates? If they were in stasis, wouldn't they remain so?I really thought that the look the female white spike gave Chris Pratt towards the end when him and his daughter are working on the toxin together would lead to a ""oh no, they actually are what awoke the aliens in the first place!""
type of revelation, but that didn't happen, and instead of the ""elite team"" going in and destroying the aliens with the inconsequential toxin, they just end up blowing up and shooting all of the monsters just like the future people did.The whole movie revolving around this mission to secure the toxin just feels utterly pointless because they could have just blown the ship up at any time once they figured out where it was, and you would think that the future people would have just sent all research materials back to the past anyways instead of just immediately starting a military draft to whittle down the human population to near extinction.",The Tomorrow War

This had the potential to be a 10/10 all around, but the writing was sloppy and felt like a high school play at times.Chris Pratt is truly worthy of ""action hero"" status, and his supporting cast was excellent in their own regard.Just wish the script would've been massaged enough to put this film on par with so many other excellent alien style movies.",The Tomorrow War

3596,singingheart924,Great Action Flick and Perfect Summer Fun,10,4 July 2021,"I love me a good alien/ time travel/ hero movie and this one doesn't disappoint. Usually these types of movies are so full of grating language, they are hard to watch and I've gotten to the point that I have to gear myself up for the cursing or just simply avoid them altogether. There is an scene with some ""colorful"" words, but it's really funny.I don't do well with the suspenseful movies that are constantly having things surprise the characters (and viewers). This movie had some of that but you could almost predict it was going to happen - and sometimes it didn't. Don't get me wrong, the suspense was intense over and over, and the action felt pretty non-stop at times. For me to make it through one of these action/suspense movies with only one or two yelps meant that I could enjoy it without having to quell constant anxiety.The best part for me were the relationships and heroism. So many good things to say about both. Some people die and some people live, of course, but it's for the right reasons. It didn't feel gratuitous at all, but meaningful.Then there were the aliens... just scary and horrible enough to make you almost enjoy watching those suckers die. They really gave me a ""Stranger Things"" vibe, and definitely had some good squishy and gut spewing moments.I know there are people who think this movie wasn't ""believable"" enough, or convoluted, or whatever, but I thought it was a well balanced ""action and aliens"", feel good summer movie! And for those of us more on the ""jumpy"" side, who don't want to hear the ""f-bomb"" every couple seconds, it was perfect.",The Tomorrow War

Yes if you really felt it necessary you could question the science and space time contium arc and similarities to alien, edge of tomorrow etc but it's not about that. It's a simple end of the world alien action movie. It does exactly what is says on the tin but that isn't why I enjoyed it so much.No, the reason this was so refreshing for me in 2021 is the fact that it is initially set in 2022 but none of the current 2021 political tropes were there.The only race mentioned in this film is the human race. There are numerous strong and intelligent black and female lead characters standing front and centre. None of them telling the white male characters to check their privilege or projecting anti white sentiment or faux outrage and virtue signalling. No critical race theory anti conservative views, No ""progressive"" gender tropes all of which is now the norm in Hollywood.A good cast, good characters, good CGI and action sequences.

Chris Pratt is very likeable as the slightly struggling Dad whom gets thrown into the events that unfurl. Really great design on a new alien that actually scares a bit which some cgi monsters don't. The action is very tense at times and you actually aren't sure if anyone is safe and could die at any moment (which I love) given the time travel logistics.The best part though is that when we get to some emotional scenes you actually care, which gives them weight.

3626,williamrodgers-155-762926,Science Fiction and Time travel always screws people up.,9,25 July 2021,"The Science Fiction label hides a very deep father-daughter story. Yvonne Strahovski is incredible, I cannot overstate this. As far as the time travel goes, I have read many reviews by people who don't understand time travel theory because they haven't read enough SF. The future timeline shown in the movie continues (IMHO), but when he comes back and destroys the aliens, he creates a new timeline that he lives with his family. The timeline where his daughter dies continues or ends depending on which theory you believe. Also, coming up with the toxin and sending it back, was important to the daughter because she knows it's too late to save what is her present and doesn't know that when he gets back, he is going to find the ship and that his team is going to blow it up. After all, in her timeline, he hasn't done it. This explanation answers the, ""if a man goes back in time and kills his grandfather"" paradox. I think that most people do not understand this because the only character in the movie that understands this is the daughter, at least, until at the end when all the main characters seem to get it. My main problem with the SF was the aliens, their energy level was too high considering the food source available even accounting all the mammals they had available. They were prolific like rats or rabbits( read prey), should have been slower like wolves and other preditors.",The Tomorrow War

3640,milos-bugarcic,Don't do this to your brain,1,5 July 2021,"I never wrote a comment here about any movie, although I saw some amazing and some horrible ones, but felt obliged to do so now because I want to give contribution against Hollywood treating viewers like mindless zombies. The main issue is scenario - something like this should never be allowed in an A production movies. I need to share some spoilers to explain what I mean.Sending elderly untrained and underarmed civilians to the future like lambs to the slaughter, and in small weekly batchesBunch of illogical personal coincidences: daughter that is the only chance for the world and does everything by herself, wife that finds the solution for the problem in the past, student obsessed with volcanos finding the potential whereabouts of the ship, dad who flies a plane and is anti-government, but also is good at killing.He throws himself after daughter which is certainly going to die, risking her part and the whole world in a mindless act of bravery which literally hurts to watch.He comes back with a solution from future and nobody listens to him, except for a few soldiers from future who also decide to multiply the venom by themselves because nobody is interested to do so (because of - spending money of taxpayers, countries are again against each other for unclear reasons).They go to a Russian glacier alone (like 7-8 of them, whereas whole nations were sending 1000s of people to death just a week before) with a plane operated by dad and don't even split up to look for the source. Instead they all go together, few meters away from each other and stumble onto it in a vast Siberian wasteland.Time travel concept is archaic, but that could have worked if it was at least provided an attempt of credibility. But it didn't.Oh yes, and 500k people alive in the future. That level of mass extinction is a stretch. Not to mention the scarcity of resources. There was no need to push the sense of urgency with such ridiculous numbers. This would mean that 6 billion, 995 million died out of 7 billion for example. 0.007% of population survived. Who came up with that?Lazy effort in terms of scenario, really felt like I was abused for the most of the second-half of the movie.

He is living a good life yet we somehow have to believe that's not the case as he fails an interview...
then the 'future' war - you are saying that he got drafted and instead of calling his wife first went straight to the recruiters office?Then the training - no futuristic guns or other military devices?The jump - how did a group of absolute newbies (in terms of warfare) who also had their 7-day training bootcamp cut short not panicked right after realizing their time travel went wrong?Why does the monster's size and agility not translate into an immediate slaughter of the surviver's in close quarters?Why do monsters shoot only when you are in cover and when you are standing up in the middle of a street?Why would you not ask you bombers to take an extra minute or two circling the city at high altitude while your extraction team is getting clear of the bombing area?Will their escape not also entice the targets to move out of your bombing zone?Every single scene is a 'why' that was making me more and more irritated in this movie. There is no humor, there is very little of engaging action, and there is no horror - so why even watching it?Also, why by the end of the movie a massive super strong monster gets kicked off a cliff by an average-sized dude?

I think it made quite a bit of sense and could've made an AMAZING Tv show, but alas the movie was made and I have a few problems.1. The movie introduced a lot of key concepts very very fast. They were deployed within like the first 20 minutes and I just didn't understand the relevance of a lot of information. Also in the future, when Pratt's character kept mentioning coming back for his daughter...wouldn't she have been saved and wouldn't exist anymore? I don't understand that at all. Her timeline would be erased and made fresh before anything even happened.2. A lot of conflict. They taught a lot of battles and had a lot of different challenges to face so I wasn't 100% what I was supposed to focus on? The task at hand or the overall aliens and the time travel. It was a very confusing plot line. How did they even have time to create time travel when they were trying to save the world. They had a lot of obstacles to get through, the first deployment, then the female, and then the female being some sort of cure...but then the female got out...and then Pratt's daughter died...and somehow that was relevant...and then they had to find out how the aliens got there, then they had to kill them...which was something of a challenge in itself. It was a lot. System overload.3. The acting was good. The acting was better than most other alien movies, that wasn't the problem, it was the fact that the movie just didn't make sense. It would second guess themselves and generally be incredibly confusing.

FUNNY, light and SMART humor, the way it's supposed to be, not like the vulgar ""so called humor"" that's mostly on screen these days. This humor was natural and refreshing! I want more please! Hurry before the world actually ends. ;)4. Movie also showed how it's important to be educated and smart! Smart folks (whether self taught or educated in schools) were the real heros in the end when they worked together. That's what made this action movie different. It wasn't just about brute force and weapons and one superhero that never gets killed just because he looks good and has shiney teeth. It was both actually, full force of people fighting, thinking and working together. I hope this influences children to pursue education and information instead of just sports, drugs, and rock and roll. Def need more smart movies and shows that activate brain cells, if they want to be..5. The animation and effects were great, the monsters were really scary and not cheesey at all! I would have def went to fight!Conclusion, Well thought out movie, exciting from start to finish! I couldn't take my eyes away from the tv and didn't even want to blink!10/10 nothing disappointing about this movie! So, Thank you! I will watch more than once.",The Tomorrow War
3657,jaxondes,Slightly Above Average Sci Fi Flick,6,3 July 2021,"There are a bunch of 1- and 10-star reviews on here. These don't accurately tell the experience. Quite a few people have complained about the plot holes of time jumping etc. As someone who has watched time-travel movies for many years, they are working off the ""back-to-the -future"" theory (each jump to the past creates an alternate reality). This in turn means that the future war is unaffected by changes in the past, so that's why future people want to bring the present forward instead of just solving everything in the past. They explain their time travel theory as a wormhole that is temporal-locked at 30 years and allows time travel between two points in time like rafts in a River. Reasonably creative explanation that attempts to pacify the overthinkers... and I am an over-thinker. This movie does not bother with explaining details of the mechanics of their sci fi universe, it mostly states it. Suspension of disbelief was not a challenge here.From a plot perspective, I give it 6 stars. Some good twists, mostly predictable but The acting was good. There are some obvious misses in plot that make one wonder if the writers were primarily lifting from other movies, but it was still mostly enjoyable. They could have really won if Chris Pratt was somehow responsible for starting the invasion in the first place. I was actually hoping for that.Unfortunately the dialogue was far too quiet and some of the best moments were lost.Graphics and CGI were a 10.However, for the cliche moments in the film, I give only 2 stars. Too many cringeworthy, predictable moments for this movie to really shine. (Spoiler alert: Global warming plays a role) It has the obligatory scary monsters- hunting people scene (predator). The obligatory monsters climbing the wall en -masse scene (WWZ) the obligatory and over -the-top shooting monsters and spilled - guts scenes (Aliens) and of course, the obligatory monsters eating people scenes (Jurassic park)Over all, not a bad movie. I didn't see too many plot holes, although it seems that they cut some scenes that would have perhaps helped the movie along, and the entire premise seems slightly illogical. Why not spend the research on weapons breakthroughs that would defeat the aliens instead of bringing in more alien fodder (read: humans) from the past?",The Tomorrow War

3660,helenlitvinenko,"Decent Premise, Terrible Execution",2,2 July 2021,"This movie would have been way, WAY better if some tweaks were made to the storyline because there are several things don't make sense at all.In the future, Chris Pratt's character meets his daughter who has now grown up to be a super smart scientist/colonel and they work alongside to try and win the war by coming up with a toxin to kill the aliens. He is supposed to take this toxin back to his present and mass produce it so that they're prepared for the war...As he is about to be blipped back to his time, the aliens start attacking and his daughter is badly injured so he doesn't want to leave her behind and tries to save her, essentially, risking his own life (and everyone else's lives since, if he doesn't make it back with the toxin, all of humanity is screwed).First of all, why bother trying to save her in the future when, literally, all he has to do is bring the toxin back and prevent the war from happening in the first place (i.e. Humans have the upper hand, kill all the aliens, daughter doesn't end up getting killed by them)??Then, this brings us to a time-travel paradox - if he takes the toxin back to her past/his present and prevents the war; (even though she is portrayed as a smart kid at 9 years old) she would have no need/motivation to become this PhD-having-MIT-alum/super soldier (caused by the war); therefore, she wouldn't be able to create the toxin in the first place.Next, immediately after blipping back, he wants to make more toxin and get back to the future asap...But why not just hold on to it in the present until they need to use it??Also, back in the present, a realization is made that the aliens were always here, they were just frozen in an glacier...Well how about maybe using that as a reason to combat climate change so the darn thing doesn't melt in the first place?? No ice melting = no aliens coming out = no war (and, I mean, come on, who knows what else is in there!).And finally, when they go to the Russian glacier to nip the alien problem in the bud, they literally bring a team of 8-10 people. And, of course, not everything goes swimmingly...But come onnnn, if the stake of humanity is at hand, shouldn't you come a little more prepared?? Maybe bring some actual backup??Anyway, I think this movie was about half an hour too long. The plot falls apart after he comes back home. Many parts were super obvious/predictable and cliché. SO many plot holes...I would have given it 1 star but I like Chris Pratt. It's a shame that he actually produced this movie; perhaps he should just stick to acting.",The Tomorrow War

3693,zendoss,🚨 Perfect Summer Action-Adventure Film 🚨,7,2 July 2021,"In short, is this a masterpiece? No. Is it groundbreaking? No. But what it is, is entertaining and fun. As some critics have pointed out, it feels very 90's. Which I believe works.It has a great cast, cool yet admittedly wack concept, fun set pieces and a nice soundtrack. However, what is of course the best part of the film and it's main selling point: killer aliens and Chris Pratt. The aliens have a nice design, and are perfect for the summer blockbuster style.Pratt is excellent and continues prove to be an actor who feels like he's in the wrong era, the perfect 80's and 90's leading man.The story isn't all that deep or thorough, and the characters could use work. But Pratt delivers and the cast is still fun.Perhaps one or two too many jokes, and again the writing is far from great, but the film does acknowledge what it is whilst still providing some emotional stakes.J. K. Simmons is also excellent as always.All in all, a decent and fun alien/monster adventure film. I feel it could've bettered from a non-PG-13 rating.Biggest issue was the overuse of CGI. But sadly that's the ways movies seem to go these days.That said, with all the garbage Hollywood releases, and with all the comic book and franchise films, and of course you award winners, it is nice to have a film that doesn't necessarily feel those categories. In short, a fun film. Shame it released on streaming, would've been better in the cinema.Don't buy into the overly positive or aggressively negative reviews. This film ain't that bad or that amazing (objectively) but is exactly what you want from a sci-fi summer blockbuster.As always decide for yourself, but if you're reading this and need some swaying: I recommend The Tomorrow War. 7.5/10.",The Tomorrow War

So maybe as long as the link exists time shift won't take place?Or Maybe they create an alternate reality? (Like End Game)Or Maybe we get to guess what's happening here?(12 Monkeys TV Show... horrible ending)Or... time travelling part exists,
but only as a glitter to an alien movie,
to steer it away from herd?I don't regret watching it,
I don't believe that watching it was a waste of time..
I am probably not watching it again either...A good family movie... and it's not bad at all... it just not as good as I wanted it to be...

It was just a movie you could sit back and enjoy. Chris Pratt did really well, as did JK Simmons, and Yvonne Strahovski, and I thoroughly enjoyed the characters of Charlie (portrayed by Sam Richardson) his comedic relief was perfectly timed imo, and Dorian (played by Edwin Hodge) was a great ""straight man"" to Charlie's comedy. His nihilism was also a poignant counter point to Dan's optimistic and hopeful ideals.While this genre of sci-fi isn't ground breaking I felt this story was done well and something new to the genre I haven't seen before.

What about 4 rafts? Everyone in the rooms now understands time travel.. okay whatever, this movie wasn't made to solve time travel and it never intended to try but thats also okay!Great emotional, action driven, monster killing joy ride! As a dad and husband who loves his family, this movie made me tearful on more than one occasion. Watch it with friends or family, it's a blockbuster movie in your house. Just know the alien invaders are actually terrifying in case the littles ones are easy to scare.Why I give this movie an 8 out of 10 is because the story is driven, never stalls out always moving forward and never disappointed.

If any of the characters behaved with the fraction of normal intelligence and knowledge, this catastrophe of a movie would end after 15 minutes. And no action setpieces can't cover that.

Perfect Friday night no brainer movie.",6,2 July 2021,"A bit of Edge of Tomorrow (Time Alien invasion theme), a bit of Interstellar (Time Family theme), a bit of Doom (brutal entertaining action), a bit of Alien (what is the alien going to do elements), a bit of Predator (teamwork makes the ugly monsters go byebye theme). All in all a decent movie. Sadly Chris Pratt feels like the weakest actor in the ensemble. Not his best. Maybe he wasn't allowed to showcase his humourous side. Good action. And i like they didn't make it too short. When i thought the movie was going to end it wrnt oj a bit longer to bring us to a satisfying resolution. But logic no make the sense. And all the characters are one dimensional. Bring your popcorn. Leave your weary work brain behind. Enjoy this movie on a Friday night after a long week at work and it kinda helps reset your morale for the weekend. Not good enough for me to watch again or buy the blu ray. But I'm 100% glad I watched it in full in one sitting.",The Tomorrow War

It's a great idea of parents of today fighting a war to save their kids but the script is just really dumb. Bad dialogue, people acting in ways that make no sense, lots of filler scenes. The acting is excellent despite the terrible script and the VFX are decent even if the aliens look like a combination of every terrible thing all into one (teeth, talons, scorpion tail), it's like they couldn't decide which would make the aliens look scariest so they just threw everything in.",The Tomorrow War

The main actor's facial expressions are as convincing as the acting in the funeral plan adverts. Those saying the acting was good I think shows a difference in expectation between the US & U. K.
Every weapon has infinite bullets & no effect except that fortunately these clever aliens forgot to armour plate one tiny bit of themselves; convenient.CGI gives it both stars, otherwise I wanted to give it '0'.After 45 minutes *I* wanted to be eaten by the aliens to take me away from this drivel.If this is a sign that the film industry has developed long (haul) Covid, we are in for another terrible couple of years.",The Tomorrow War
3734,mmcdonough-27704,What the hell is this movie,2,8 July 2021,"The concept had potential but the writing was so thoughtless it took away from the entire movie.Chris Pratt is acting like he has to go back and save the 500,000 and his daughter literally after coming back with the serum to save humanity and hugging his daughter.Chris Pratt dives after his daughter who is falling into a sea of whitespikes only to be called back (1 second after the armband announces 20 seconds) He had the formula in his hand and jumped into that same sea of whitespikes.It takes maybe 20 minutes of looking around Russia to find where the spaceship is. They stop because their instruments aren't working and assume it's alien spaceships?They have 30 years to solve the problem and hey immediately go to Russia without telling anyone else one the planet?The CGI and aliens were cool but the fact nothing in plot makes sense takes all that away.",The Tomorrow War

Was the plot god-awful, the pace jolting, and the writing obscenely lazy and banal (maybe some other science facts from our leading biologist protagonist other than how respiration turns oxygen to CO2 and how ""magical"" it is that ""the stuff we breathe out trees breathe in""... like, pick up any high school-level science book and take ANY fact out of it... ugh, cue the first of many groans)? Anyway, I digress. Yes. The answer is yes. Did I watch the whole ridiculous thing anyway? Yes, yes I did.Why? Because sci-fi movies are rarely not interesting. I suppose I might even say I was entertained. The premise is fine on this one, and it even delivers great looking CGI/well-designed aliens. Bravo. But, seriously, the PLOT, guys. I mean, most time travel rules (that we've learned from other time travel movies, of course) are thrown out the window to make this work. And the flimsy characters with relationships we don't know why we should care about with backstories described in such poor detail yet attempting to prompt buy-in from the viewer so maybe we have some sort of an emotional connection to any of them... no ... don't even get me started.And then the forced cheesy voiceover monologue at the end? Ugh. Final groan. Chris Pratt, Arnold deserves better from his SIL.

There are some quotable lines though, and J. K. Simmons earns a new 'forever' nickname.The monsters are gross and appropriately dangerous, and the visual effects are good.It seems like the film has one or two too many acts, but if they're going to pay for it to be in there, why cut it, amiright? 😉 Let's put it this way- at the establishing shot of one scene my wife asked: ""Is this how Water World starts?"" Maybe. But I liked this a little better.",The Tomorrow War

Too improbable to be believable.Nor is it explained why the people they transport to the future are no more skilled in combat than the average college professor (I know because I once was one). Their ""training"" is laughable. Why not train people on earth for a decade and THEN transport them back in time.And they can't kill the suckers unless they hit them in just the right place. So......get them guns that work better. Lots and lots of firing of guns, but rarely are any aliens killed. And they never seem to need to reload.

The movie was good with lot of action & alien fights packed up, the pacing of the movie was good and i really like the callbacks of characters although i would have loved to have seen them explore the wide concepts of time travel after so much has been done in this genre maybe pratt going in Russia with his team to kill the aliens could've have triggered the alien uprising or some use of paradoxical events might've toughened up the script but overall it was a decent movie & I'd recommend you this if you like post-apocalyptic alien action genre movies.7/10.",The Tomorrow War

The emotional scenes and deaths don't work because you simply don't care about anyone. The humor is dumb and out of place. It's unintentionally funny at times. The cgi monsters look very generic like you've seen them in several movies before. It's also way too long. In many ways it reminded me of many other sci-fi flicks but not in a good way.It's a very dumb and cheap knock-off of Edge of Tomorrow.,The Tomorrow War

Fun (Guns, explosions, fighting, swarms)Thrilling (Honestly, it had my heart pounding at times!)Easy to watch (The CGI is VERY impressive)Suspenseful (Literally edge of your seat squirming)If you're looking for something visually satisfying and heart-thumping, this movie has the excitement you're looking for.

3747,MissNevermore,"""I hope aliens eat whoever made this""",1,11 July 2021,"Dear Hollywood. I'm deeply sorry to inform you that explosions and special effects do not, in fact, count as a plot. Not even in an action movie. Nothing that happens in this film makes the slightest bit of sense. Humanity, as portrayed here, could never have invented time travel. In fact, everyone acts so stupid I doubt they would be able to invent tools. I wound up rooting for the nonsensical devil-ex-machina aliens purely because those, while they also appear decidedly non-sentient, at least might evolve into something interesting one day. This. Is. Not. Scifi. At least no more than ""Sharknado"" is. This is a 200 million dollar B-movie, at best, and no, casting Chris Pratt as the main character cannot save this( no offence to said actor, this is not his fault). The special effects are somewhat impressive ( if stupid), but the story is appallingly bad even for low-end action flick and the characters are so bland it's impossible to care for them. The only novel thing about the writing ( if you could even call it that) is it's incredible stupidity. My message to whoever's responsible for this idiotic mess of a movie : I suggest that next time you have a spare 200-million dollars on your hands, you use some of that money to a) buy and read some actual proper sci fi novels.b) hire someone who can actually write a plot-1/ 10.",The Tomorrow War

Yeah the approved soldier died before the ailen war takes place, so that one will not meet oneself in the future, but it's not enough.If one of the 'grandparents' happened to give birth to a solder in the future and died before the war, likely that grandparent would be chosen to travel to the future to fight. If he died during that 7 days, no child will be born! Ok so some people in the future iare gonna suddenly disappear!! (like Endgame..?)

However, maybe the reason ten episode series are more popular is because you can further develop a story than you can in a 2 hr film.Spoiler alert.....The one issue I had was how they so easily captured the queen alien with little effort. Aside from the time travel plot and how the aliens destroyed our air forces and naval forces, why was the climax scenes so dull.

It takes a parallel timelines theory of time-travel which isn't expressly stated until approximately half-way through. The majority of the negative reviews refer to the illogical nature of the plot, with a parallel timelines theory of time-travel the logic is sound and the plot an engaging and interesting take on an alien/time-travel story. Character relationships are investing with excellent acting particularly from the actress playing Muri, the story with a tone of moral messaging and redemption.

3809,matteos-28813,"A time travel movie meets a military movie and sci-fi, how could this go wrong?",6,5 July 2021,"A time travel movie meets a military movie and sci-fi, how could this go wrong? Chris McKay delivered a genre colliding action packed movie all under the runtime of a short 2 hours and 41 minutes, a very impressive film coming from the director which found success with ""The Lego Batman Movie"" (2017) only a couple years ago. The cinematography done by Larry Fong added a much needed scale and suspense to each shot as he carried his experience for big budget action packed films with his work on ""Kong: Skull Island"" (2017) & ""Watchmen""(2009). When watching this film the problems I had with the film did not lay alongside the cinematography, pacing or production design. The problems I ran into all had to do with the story written by Zack Dean. The main concept of this film which Zack Dean was trying to achieve was a military from the future travels back 30 years to draft random people and send them back to the future to fight this war. This is where the plot holes begin to take place and confuse the audience. The government decided to send 50% of their military and all draft able civilians to the future to help save the world. Why couldn't they just learn as much as possible about the aliens, use their military and funding to set up a defense and prepare the world for war which will happen in 30 years rather than send civilians to the future where we learn there is a 33% survival rate amongst all people to travel and fight. Later on in the film we run into another plot hole or rather a sub plot mission which does not make sense. Chris Pratt and his daughter in the future are on their war for a mission of capturing a female alien to conduct research and analysis. We later learn that there are limited people in the army so it makes it easier to gain the achievement of becoming a colonel what doesn't make sense is the colonel is conducting this mission to capture the female alien, it does not seem like a colonel would be face to face with danger and voluntarily putting him or herself in harm's way when having so much responsibility and people to lead especially on borrowed time which is commonly said throughout the film. The time which it would take to train someone new in the role as colonel would make the war harder to fight with the lack of experience. Plot holes like this make the film very difficult to follow and almost puts the audience on cruise control until the next action packed sequence starts. Chris McKay made a good film out of a not so good screenplay although including all aspects of this film it came together very nicely with some amazing touches from the VFX artists making this a genre bending alien movie to not be forgotten. Sadly the overarching story pulled the film down from its full potential. I hope everybody gets a chance to see this movie on Prime Video where it will be a memorable time experiencing the twists, turns and awesome alien designs all for the first time.",The Tomorrow War
3810,nickelseo,"Great actors, terrible plotholes.",7,14 July 2021,"Thoroughly enjoyed the movie. I'm a 90's kid and will always enjoy action. The obvious placement of character like the high school volcano nerd and the pilot for a father that left the son who would one day leave his daughter made for blatant and lazy writing. Chris Pratt and the rest of the crew made it enjoyable, but the writing should have been better.However compared to everything else I've seen so far in the past year, this was the most entertaining new movie yet.",The Tomorrow War

3816,ryanwiltbank,Could have been good....,4,7 July 2021,"The reason this gets a four is because of the acting, and the general concept of the movie. Two thirds of the way through I was on board and then it's like they thought to themselves ""what stupid cliche over the top nonsense can we throw in to ruin this movie?""Spoilers aheadI was on board with the movie until right before he came back to his own time. That's when the movie goes so far off the rails that you realize even the beginning wasn't great. List of stupid things? The high schooler that was a volcano expert being the only person who they could turn to for answers. Chris Pratt's character being told he was going to turn out just like his dad despite absolutely no set up for him having issues with his family and in fact contrary to how important they show his family to be to him (I believe they did this just to tie in him learning to forgive his father). The crashing into the future (this could be forgiven but it really just feels like they wanted it to be an action packed arrival and never gave any serious reason for it). Everyone who came back NOT being traumatized at all despite the whole ""70% don't come back and the 30% that do are so traumatized they can't even speak"" speech. The government not just not using the vile Chris Pratt brings back but not even like being very government like and saying ""that's ours and you can't have it since it's from the future"" (and the whole ""everything is falling apart cause the wormhole is gone"" IS NOT enough of an excuse for them to ignore the one thing the future sends back to try and save us). The ""oh so cute"" but really just stupid scene with the high school volcano ash expert and all the other high schoolers realizing ""he's not weird, he is brilliant"". The stupidity of the ""let's just drive around on snowmobiles and hope we find something"" scene and not even used something like, oh I don't know, google earth to look for it from a satellite. Having a line like ""I made as much of the serum as I could"" and then it just so happens they have the exact amount to kill all the females. The forced stupid ""funny/awesome"" scene with the guy not having loaded his gun (callback to that other joke which WAS funny) to set up giving him the big moment of courage to use a saw in hand to hand combat (cause they thought it was a cool visual). Then being able to blow up ALL the other white spikes and having the dumb ""one got away"" and then going way way way over the top with so many stupid action scenes for that last one. We watched white spikes ram tanks and flip them and we are supposed to believe Chris Pratt can tackle them? Cmon. The white spikes got easier and easier to kill throughout the movie which just made them less and less of this terrifying threat they were supposed be, and they forced the story in unrealistic directions to give characters their ""moment"".Wasted an awesome set up and a pretty dang good cast.",The Tomorrow War

A conclusion is made with 20mins of the film left to go, and I think that would have been a good ending point. It would have been a slight cliff hanger but left the film open for a sequel if it had been successful?
