0,Leofwine_draca,Average at best,5,6 October 2021,"Another day, another JOHN WICK clone, this time with Mary Elizabeth Winstead taking on the Keanu Reeves role to kick it up with the Japanese Yakuza. This one suffers from a huge deficit of originality, with tired and predictable plot twists and an ending you'll see coming a mile off. There are huge problems throughout, from an inexperienced director to an inexperienced child actor, both of whom do poorly, and Winstead giving a particularly bland performance. The best actors are inevitably the Japanese - Miyavi and Jun Kunimura in particular. The good news is that the fight scenes have pretty good choreography, although the less said about THAT awful CGI car chase, the better...",Kate
1,SnoopyStyle,another one,5,14 September 2021,"Kate (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) is a professional assassin working under her mentor Varrick (Woody Harrelson). He had trained her from when she was a young orphan. She's in Japan to kill a yakuza leader. At the last moment, a girl shows up on the scene breaking her main rule of not endangering children. She is ordered to kill anyways. She considers quitting her job. Later, she is poison and given 24 hours to live or in her case, 24 hours to exact revenge.It's the same old same old. It's another pretty girl turned trained killer. I almost appreciate more the Tokyo street life. I enjoy the vending machine and the limited back alleys. The fact is that Japan is nothing new either but it's interesting that this movie is going full Lost in Translation. As for Mary, she's never played an icy cold killer. Even in Birds of Prey, she's more an awkward dorky killer. All of that is fine. It doesn't have to be original or new. My main problem is that there is an obvious suspect. It is completely predictable and it's annoying that Kate doesn't even consider it initially. This is fine but it's not going to stand out among a very crowded field. This is likely to be forgotten soon after.",Kate
2,nogodnomasters,You're a Terminator!,7,23 September 2021,"Kate (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) is a trained assassin killing the Yakuza in Tokyo. She misses on a shot because she was poisoned with Po-204. She has about a day to avenge her own poisoning. She ends up working with a teen (Miku Patricia Martineau) whose father she assassinated in opening scene.This is yet a another revenge assassin film. The plots are basically the same. Po-204 has a 3.5 hour half-life which means it must have been manufactured with 12-24 hours before it was ingested. The should have just gone with 210. Rather than attempt chelation to remove the poison, she opts to hobble around with sores and bleeding. Makes for good visual, but not very practical.Guide: F-word. Sex. No nudity.",Kate
3,kosmasp,Killer Kate,8,12 September 2021,"I am quite sure there was a movie that had that title. Not comparing those two though, just so you know. Just giving the movie a description that can be called apt! There have been a lot of action movies with female leads, not all felt right. Some had weird action scenes that just didn't seem to work ... not here! Mary as Kate is exceptional and while you can more than argue about the story/plot (bare minimum), you cannot fault the movie where it matters most for an action movie: the action/stunts! Amazing is almost an understatement.Really well choreographed and it feels like Mary (Kate) is doing her thing ... and knows her stuff too. I can only imagine the training she went through! The movie also is reality based in a sense - you can feel and see that she isn't invincible and that every ""interaction"" leaves marks ... pun intended.You may not agree with certain things or think it is predictable and may feel that the Japanese element of the story could have been explored more (all valid points to make, if you want to), but this is as kick a** as it gets! Yes I censored myself because I'm not sure if that word is allowed on here and I don't want the review to be denied because of it. Watch it if you are not squeamish, because the movie is and gets really violent.",Kate
4,Sleepin_Dragon,Fooled again by number 1 on Netflix.,5,13 September 2021,"Why do I do it, why do I always think that the number one choice is going to be good, it never is, and there's a good example of it here.Kate has 24 hours to get revenge on those that poisoned her, that's literally the plot, that start is followed by the most improbable, crazy fight sequences you will ever see.It goes on a bit, it looks pretty good, I loved the visuals, but that's the best element, the story is wafer thin, it lacks any sort of heart.Good acting, Mary Elizabeth Winstead is cracking, I am a big fan, sadly Woody isn't around for much, and that's a real shame.All in all, another disappointing film on Netflix, 5/10.",Kate
5,classicsoncall,"""You got any boom-boom lemon?""",7,12 September 2021,"Seeing Woody Harrelson in a trailer for this film is what brought me to it, but for all practical purposes, he serves no more than a bookend for this story about his protégé Kate (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), a superbly trained assassin who's targeted herself when she fails to follow through on an important assignment. Surreptitiously given a drink laced with polonium-204, Kate faces a hopeless future of exactly twenty four hours in which to exact her revenge on the person who contracted for her demise. If one has seen enough of these types of stories, your antenna should be up early for signs of the double cross that inevitably follows, along with the insanely brutal violence that erupts whenever our title character is faced with a challenge. There's not much new that can be added to this genre, but I was fascinated by that highly stylistic and neon inspired car chase early on, with filming angles that twists one's perspective in unusual ways. I knew there had to be some significance attached to the conversation between Varrick (Harrelson) and Kate regarding the implications of a gut shot, so the story's conclusion eventually put that scene in perspective. The only happy ending here was for the young Japanese girl Ani-chan (Miku Patricia Martineau), but only up until the point Varrick found himself a new trainee.",Kate
6,Tweekums,"Put 'DOA', 'John Wick', 'Nikita' and 'Crank' in a blender and you get 'Kate'",8,19 October 2021,"From childhood Kate has been trained to be the perfect assassin. In the opening scenes we see her take out a member of the Yakuza in Osaka in front of his brother and daughter. Ten months later she is in Tokyo and still bothered about the girl witnessing the killing and wants to quit. Of course she will have to undertake one final mission. This doesn't go to plan and she lets the target live. She chases the target but crashes her car. In hospital she learns that she had been poisoned before the job got underway. There is no chance of survival; she has about twenty four hours to find the person responsible and get her revenge.It is fair to say this film is fairly derivative; the central premise comes from the classic film noir 'DOA' but by having our lead an assassin out for a revenge, rather than an ordinary person, we get treated to lots of 'John Wick' style action as she works her way to her target... original no but highly entertaining if you like that sort of thing. The action is suitably varied as people are shot, stabbed and in once case decapitated with a samurai sword! This is all impressively choreographed. The action is pretty violent with plenty of blood being spilt and some fairly unpleasant injuries shown. The story is fairly predictable with twists that anybody familiar with this sort of film will see a mile off; that didn't matter for me though as the action doesn't let up long enough to give you time to worry about such things. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is really impressive as Kate; making the action seem believable. Woody Harrelson is solid as her mentor, even though he gets less screen time than one might hope for and Miku Martineau is likable as Ani, the daughter of the man she kills in the opening scene and later gets caught up in Kate's revenge operation. The Tokyo setting is great; I'm glad they had Japanese characters talking in subtitled Japanese rather than having them speak English as would probably have been the case had it been made a few years ago. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to fans of the genre.",Kate
7,paul_haakonsen,Now this was rather entertaining...,7,10 October 2021,"When I sat down to watch the 2021 action crime movie titled ""Kate"" from writer Umair Aleem and director Cedric Nicolas-Troyan, I must admit that I had been told that the movie wasn't all that great. But still, I opted to sit down to watch it and rate the movie based on my own impressions of what I saw.And let me say that I am glad that I did, because ""Kate"" turned out to be a rather entertaining movie for me. There was just something dynamic about the storyline that worked out quite well, and I will say that there wasn't a dull moment throughout the course of the movie.The story told in ""Kate"", as written by Umair Aleem, was well-written and nicely paced. It was a storyline that was easy to follow and actually takes you on an adrenaline-filled thrill ride. So the writer managed to put together a very wholesome and entertaining storyline here.I was immediately submerged and drawn into the setting and the plot of ""Kate"", so the movie turned out to be rather enjoyable for me.Visually then ""Kate"" is a great movie, especially with the setting of the whole thing. And the whole chase and shootout scene in the back alleys was just amazing, it was like watching an intense shooter game.""Kate"" has a great cast ensemble that includes the likes of Mary Elizabeth Winstead (playing Kate),
Miku Patricia Martineau (playing Ani), Woody Harrelson (playing Varrick) and Jun Kunimura (playing Kijima). So you are in for a great treat in terms of cast. And the actors and actresses definitely performed well in the movie and brought their characters to life on the screen in a fulfilling manner.I was more than genuinely entertained by ""Kate"", and it feels like a good old fashioned action crime movie, one that you can watch more than just once.My rating of ""Kate"" lands on a seven out of ten stars.",Kate
8,searchanddestroy-1,Nikita meets DOA and Crank,8,14 September 2021,"As I have already said before, since several years now, there are batches of NIKITA rip-offs nearly everywhere, most of them lesser than the original. This one makes no exception, being not cliché ridden, a hired killer wishing to retire and refusing to kill a kid as an innocent bystander.... But the overall job is good, the scheme reminding Rudolph Mate's DOA, starring Ed O'Brien and of course CRANK, with Jason statham. The lead female hero - or may I say anti hero - is good enough for me. Good time waster. Woody Harrelson is the perfect side kick. Better anyway than the last Luc Besson 's ANNA. More gloomy and darker.",Kate
9,Calicodreamin,"Cool action, predictable story",6,11 September 2021,"Kate had some great cinematography and action shots, love the vibrant colors and use of modern Japan as backshots. However, the acting was mediocre and the storyline utterly predictable. No attempts to even shake it up.",Kate
10,neil-476,OK,7,2 November 2021,"Kate is a hitwoman in Japan, her hits specified by handler Varrick, her mentor since she was orphaned as a child. When a succesful hit involves a child - an established no-no in Kate's book - she decides she's had enough. But before she can pursue retirement she is poisoned with polonium and has only 24 hors to identify her killer, track him down and exact retribution.This violent suspense thriller treads a fairly well-trod path - John Wick is the most obvious, although 1950's DOA is another obvious source - with Kate popping large numbers of anonymous bodies with no emotional significancs whatsoever. There are some plot wrinkles, most of which are signalled miles in advance and Woody Harrelson is not challenged as Varrick.But Mary Elizabeth Winstead plays against type and does well: she now carries a patina of age, and this works for her. Plus there are some well choreographed and photographed action sequences. This is decent enough, if not particularly surprising.",Kate
11,trashgang,over the top no-brainer,8,14 September 2021,"Again, totally blind into this Netflix just been told, watch it, it is good. And so it was.I just came back from Tokyo and it was shot in the district I stayed so I did recognized a few things, like the Godzilla head for example, And Lawson, and the sound of the red lights...memoriesKate is a pure revenge flick, exagerrated as there are so many at this moment. In fact, if you did like Nobody (2021) then you surely are going to like this one. And if you are into Yakuza and martial art, well, this is it.It's brutal, and bloody and messy. There's of course CGI, used for the car chase, also over the top but hey, it's so typical for these flicks.Kate is out there on flix, it's number 3 in my country so it does say a lot.Gore 1,5/5

Comedy 0/5.",Kate
12,siderite,Everything new is old again,7,10 September 2021,"The world works in a kind of spiral, where everything 30 years ago becomes popular again, with small alterations. Kate is a story of a perfect assassin, betrayed and raising hell in the name of vengeance as poison is slowly killing her. Stylish, with Japanese neo-noir design, involving the Yakuza and greedy Westerners, it is a return to the 90s stories, where lone gunmen (people?) were dealing their own brand of justice in a corrupt and decadent world full of greed and inequality. Of course, the main character is female now, but you've seen this film before, a few times perhaps, and everything is pretty standard.What shines trough the bland plot is the acting of Mary Elizabeth Winstead, who singlehandedly carries the film through. In fact, every other actor is an extra in the plot anyway, so she either made this film work or not. And it works. Kudos also to Jun Kunimura, who can, with a slight adjustment of body posture and a couple of facial expressions, tell an entire story in a second.Bottom line: a predictable story from start to finish, but made well and acted well. Ridiculous body count which could have, with small changes to the plot, be significantly reduced and the time gained spent on storytelling.",Kate
13,ops-52535,whatever you do...,6,10 September 2021,"Remember to wear Gore-tex when watching this movie, a full body suit preferably if you have got one, cause there will be blood, a whole lot of ya ku sa blood, in this film called kate, about a young american female who is very practical, very determined, extremely adaptable and utterly enduring in the proud proffesionalism called assassin, where you follow through the game of cat chasing the mice in kobe and tokyo, but where the cat eat bad bait served to her from the mighty mouse at the top of the pyramide...and so the story rolls in ups and downs actionwise , where larger knives than usual is used, and where the hero actually overtakes the foes deadly force, just to crank up her own defences for the next turn around the corner. The gore factor is simply idolized, the blood is spilled and vomited due to natural circumstances, and some of the specialeffects do give a paraplegic reflective contractions due to the shock and awe...the story is not very original though, and japanese american action has been done in the past, but with a kill factor of 16+ its rather a daring step for netflix. The physical acting are very well executed, but the screenplay cant be much more than you can engrave on a samurai sword. The action filming and much of the visual backgrounds makes this like tripping on the rollefr coaster, so stay clean is the grumpy old mans advice, and dont forget the goretex...",Kate
14,UniqueParticle,Epicness I'm shocked some of the reviews aren't praising Kate more,10,6 October 2021,Mary Elizabeth Winstead is totally badass she is a perfect treat and thrilling to see what she does/wears! This is one of ht best movies to be put on Netflix I absolutely love the ridiculous amount of people Kate kills; it's one of the greatest things ever seeing her expressions and the madness that flows. I'm quite happy that IMDb has the rating at 6.3 that pretty good! The cinematography/colors are exceptional I really like the way they made the film.,Kate
15,Tweetienator,Wanted: Capable Writers,5,27 September 2021,"Well shot, some good fight and action scenes, solid acting, and a fine performance by Mary Elizabeth Winstead. Why no higher rating? Simple, the story is predictable, generic and sometimes even tiresome (scenes with dialogue), all ideas are known and borrowed from other movies. Also the running time is in my view too long, the longer the movie run the more I felt rather bored. What else we can deduce from Kate? The universe needs a new species of writers, pronto please.",Kate
16,imseeg,"Tarantino eat your heart out! Superb acting, direction, photography. Magnificent dialogues and characters. What a blast!",9,6 October 2021,"Tarantino eat your heart out! This is the movie Tarantino should have made, but didnt. Who cares about Tarantino not producing any hardhiting original gangster movies anymore when I can see this riveting, hardhitting gangster gem?The good; TRUE to LIFE characters in an enticing story, with terrific ACTION photography, resulting in one of the best gangster shoot out movies I have seen in a long time...More good: BRILLIANT acting performances, especially by Elizabeth Mary Winstead and Woody Harrelson. These actors (and the characters they play) are of flesh and blood, full of human resentments, full of human nastiness, but these characters are also born with forgiveness and HONOR in their heart. It's these character portraits and the moral struggles of these gangsters that make this movie surpass many other gangster movies...Any bad? I cant think of any, what's especially rewarding about this movie is that EVERYTHING from photography to music score to editing to story to characters, EVERYThING is molded into one brilliantly directed gangster GEM. Easily surpasses the many other average gangster movies out there.Highly recommended for the fans of the more refined gangster movies...The story: a female trained assasin has been poisened and only has 1 day to live.

20,Pairic,Female Assassin - Again.,7,23 September 2021,"Kate: There have been a few female assassin moves lately, Ava, Anna, now we have Kate. Kate (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) is an an experienced assassin who is manipulated by her mentor/handler Varrick (Woody Harrelson) into doing one last job, another common theme, as is the requirement for the assassin to be extremely attractive. Kate enters a world of smoke and mirrors when she is poisoned, trying to track down the person behind it in the 24 hours she has left to live. Tension is maintained throughout the film with some good fight scenes and the all seeing eye of surveillance tech. Betrayals, temporary alliances abound as the narrative progresses. Nothing really new here but it's a competent assassin thriller. Directed by Cedric Nicolas-Troyan from a screenplay by Umair Aleem. On Netflix. 7/10.",Kate
21,TdSmth5,Not bad,6,12 September 2021,"Following in the footsteps of Ava, comes yet another lady assassin- Kate. Woody is her handler/friend/replacement dad who recruiter her as a little girl somehow. Kate is more of a sniper but she doesn't mind stabbing people frenetically in the neck. Now she is in Osaka about to kill a guy but he's accompanied by a little girl so Kate begs overwatch to abort the mission because it goes against their only rule--no kids, even though it's not like she has to kill the little girl. Overwatch will have none of it and Kate kills the guy. Years later she's back in Japan, which is pretty bad practice by her outfit, this time in Tokyo. This is Kate's proverbial final job. For some reason she decides to go to a bar to meet a guy on the night of the job. Her hookup ends up poisoning her with radioactive material no less, so when she has the target in her sights, can't pull the trigger.The doctor tells her she has less than 24 hours to live. So she grabs some stimulants and escapes the hospital, tracks down her hookup who tells her who ordered him to poison her. But to get to him she has to go through the Japanese mob's chain of command and she also needs the girl...the girl from the Osaka job. She tracks her down, locks her into a bathroom while the bad guys go after her. The girls escapes of course, but when she learns that she's disposable to her family, joins Kate on her mission.Kate eventually meets the big bad guy who has a surprise for her. By then the girl has won her heart but of course Kate will have to break hers once the girl finds out what Kate did in Osaka. In any case, the surprise is rather common now in movies. So Kate then has to take care of one more thing before she dies.Kate offers some very cool and interesting violent action. It surprisingly also had some very effective humor here and there. The basics of the story are good, but the way it's presented is lacking. The important bits, like Kate's past, are quickly glossed over while some lame emotional stuff takes up too much time. Missing is also nemesis to fight. It looked there one mean looking dude would be it, but she eliminates him early on, quickly, and unceremoniously. This movie is a bit too long and somewhere 3/4 into it gets rather dull only to pick up later again. There's a ridiculous cartoonish car chase scene which really doesn't fit with the quality of the rest of the movie. Unfortunate too the choice to film almost the entire movie at night. It's getting beyond tiresome that all this movies always give us the climax at night, or as in this case the whole of Kate's rest of life. Here they should have followed Ava which at least gave us all the action during daytime.Overall, Kate is worth a watch. I think the writer and director do have potential and as they gain more experience will do more of a solid job in the future.",Kate
22,I_Ailurophile,"Satisfying, enjoyable - but tries way too hard",7,16 September 2021,"'Kate' is emphatically slick and stylish - probably too much so for its own good. Infectious J-pop and J-rock dominates the soundtrack, with sparing traditional music including taiko adding further flavor at meticulously calculated moments. Every spray of blood is as lovingly considered as the electric color throughout the picture. Stuntwork and fight choreography is great, though the camerawork often bursts with flair that, again, feels too sleek and polished.This is certainly enjoyable, but it has definite problems that hold it back.I think the narrative core in Umair Aleem's screenplay is fine. However, I'd seen the point made a few weeks before I sat to watch that beyond being a tired trope of cinema, the yakuza as a Hollywood plot device reeks of othering, and misunderstanding of Japanese culture and history. Frankly, that comes across in the finished film, as 'Kate' is awash in so much detail to define its style as to feel self-indulgent. This is in addition to the highly questionable choice of centering white people in a movie set in Japan, and revolving around and ostensibly celebrating (or is that exploiting? Or appropriating?) Japanese culture. Beyond that, we've seen many action flicks with a broadly similar bent - a single hard-boiled (anti-)hero, desperate and out for revenge; tinges of character depth and sentimentality woven throughout; a twist in the plot that, details aside, is so familiar as to be predictable. Those antecedents don't mean this rendition can't be good, but it's a notable disadvantage. Then, too, there's worthy thematic content locked within that is given indelicate, incomplete consideration in the rush to film fashion.The tawdry imbalance in the screenplay is echoed in director Cedric Nicolas-Troyan's realization of it. The location scouts are to be commended for their work, and Nicolas-Troyan takes full advantage of every set with outstanding attention to detail - lighting, wardrobe and costume design, props, makeup, sound, blood, effects - and exquisite orchestration of most every scene. Love it or hate it, everything here looks absolutely fantastic. At the same time, 'Kate' tries so hard with each passing moment to be cool and thrilling - everything is built specifically to that end - that in this effort, the result is diminished. If the movie tried to simply Be, without so much grandiosity laid thick over top, the final product would have found greater success - would have actually been more cool and thrilling - than what we get.It's a rocky road, and I wanted to like 'Kate' more than I did. Still, there is one wholly consistent aspect here, and that's the acting. The whole cast is wonderful, even those in small supporting parts. I'm especially pleased to see Jun Kunimura as Kijima, portraying the crime boss with a steadiness and quiet regret that's entrancing. Woody Harrelson's supporting role as Varrick feels even less prominent, but he gives Kate's father figure an essential dangerous charisma in the way only he can. Above all, it's a fair guess that most people watching 'Kate' are here to see Mary Elizabeth Winstead - and she delivers. By now she's more than proven herself in a variety of roles, and she's solid as the protagonist, carrying will, determination, and force of personality that's invigorating. The lead role demands both range and hardness, and Winstead is perfect for the part, especially as Kate's condition deteriorates throughout the film.Ultimately, this isn't a bad movie. But even as its distributor has a large platform - unless one is specifically a fan of Winstead, there's no especial reason to seek this one out over another woman-led action flick. And at that, once again: for all the substance within the narrative, it's unquestionably undercut by stylization that tries much too hard to impress us. The many flaws of the picture could have been easily avoided, and instead every worst impulse was indulged. Not least of all thanks to its star, 'Kate' is entertaining, and its strengths only just outweigh its flaws to make it worth watching if you come across it - but don't go out of your way to check it out.",Kate
23,guisreis,Orientalist videogame,6,7 October 2021,"Action scenes are well coreographed and there are interesting (although in a quite Orientalist spirit) sets. However, the predictable and full of clichés script seems to have been made by a machine. Music score is horrible.

25,arungeorge13,The assassin subgenre is clearly getting stale - but the action is solid! [+53%],5,11 September 2021,"I can always buy Mary Elizabeth Winstead as a lady who kicks Yakuza arse, but Kate's plot is what even a sixth-grader can write better. It is almost as if director Cedric Nicolas-Troyan realized that the story has been told a zillion times before; so he chose to focus on how to make one night in Tokyo with the Yakuza the flashiest it can ever look. Tokyo, with its narrow alleyways and shiny neon-lights, has always been fascinating. But the film can't do enough justice to it - just like Beckett (another Netflix venture) failed to do the same with Greece. Even when the film dives pretty deep into Yakuza territory, it still resorts to making the generic white guy the main baddie - how disappointing!Some of the set-pieces are handled with élan. Especially, when it takes place in crowded marketplaces as opposed to indoor shootouts. Writer Umair Aleem previously wrote Extraction (no, not the Chris Hemsworth one but the trashy 2015 actioner with Bruce Willis) and I've got to say he needs to improve greatly in writing dialogues. The unlikely camaraderie between Kate and Ani is built over dialogue that today's generation will label ""cringe max"". The only aspect of his writing that I liked was how he tried to humanize Kate a little by making her a fan of Boom! Boom! Lemon and wearing an emoji t-shirt (which could even have been improvised on set than written on paper). With Kate, Winstead proves that she's a bonafide action star. Let's make her the lead in the Die Hard films going forward. I hope Woody Harrelson gladly enjoyed his paycheck because his character could have been performed by anyone else and not much would've changed. Would I recommend it? Only if you're looking for 95 minutes of slickly executed action and zero plot (or characters worth rooting for).",Kate

With the short amount of time Kate undertakes a rampaging investigation across the Tokyo criminal underworld where out of desperation Kate uses the daughter of the man she'd killed, Kijima's niece Ani (Miku Martineau), as leverage to get to Kijima while racing against her constantly weakening body.In the seven years since David Leitch and Chad Stahelski gave audiences the sleeper hit John Wick which not only reenergized Keanu Reeves appeal as an A-Lister, but also reinvented the action genre, it's safe to say the duo have become mainstays in the genre with not only multiple John Wick sequels and spin offs still eaten up by audiences with more yet to come, but also taking the formula and applying it successfully to other projects such as Atomic Blonde and fellow 2021 Leitch produced film Nobody. Kate as expected from producers with such a pedigree carries that same visceral and immersive energy we've come to expect, but unfortunately it burdens some of its goodwill by dipping into very well worn post Le Femme Nikita female lead action film ""twists"" that audiences have LONG since come to expect to the point they've almost become a pre-requisite for the sub-genre.Mary Elizabeth Winstead does very well in the lead role as the titular Kate, brining both the expected intensity and vulnerability the role calls for, but also a nice touch of biting humor with a running bit in the film about how Kate wants an soft drink called Boom Boom Lemon but it's always unavailable for one reason or another being one of many humorous moments that keeps the film from becoming too dour or serious minded. Winstead also excels in the action beats effortlessly handling the physical takedowns and shootouts with ease. Miku Martineau Ani who at first seems like a typical ""spoiled brat"" archetype is much better balanced for this type of role than I usually expect (such as in the Ethan Hawke film Getaway) and the script allows for entertaining exchanges between Winstead and Martineau be them action orientated or humorous.What unfortunately weighs on Kate is the familiarity in regards the female-centered assassin genre. Assuming you've seen the past fifteen years of female lead assassin movies starring the likes of Noomi Rapace, Milla Jovovich, and Jessica Chastain, you'll be able to spot a ""sudden reversal"" the movie sets up coming from a mile away. Admittedly since the film isn't as stoically serious as the likes of Unlocked or Ava it earns a lot more goodwill and I'm able to forgive the usage of this twist here more than I was in either of those, but I really wish they'd stop using this twist because it's not clever and the fact that it's always in every single movie of this type has become rather grating, even in otherwise good ones like this.Kate isn't on the same level as Leitch's other films like Atomic Blonde, Nobody, or John Wick, but it is an entertaining ride that boasts the same impressive action choreography and cinematography as its fellow productions. Its incorporation of a played out twist that hasn't been unexpected in about 20+ years is certainly annoying, but aside from this one sticking point I can recommend Kate to fans of the genre.",Kate
28,Holt344,Mary Elizabeth Winstead carries the film as the title character - Kate is a violent film with plenty of well executed and entertaining action sequences,7,11 September 2021,"Yet a familiar premise and story, what makes Kate stand out from the other similar action films are of course Mary Elizabeth Winstead who plays the lead role and the title character, but also its setting of Japan. In Birds of Prey she showed audience and critics that she's an action star, now she's in her own action film. Regarding her acting, the fight and action sequences, the choreography and the music. The film is great on that side, but the writing is where the film suffers heavily.The story follows Kate, an assassin whom has 24 hours to get vengeance on her murderer before she dies. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is at the center with a supporting cast like Woody Harrelson, Tadanobu Asano, Jun Kunimura, Michiel Huisman and Miku Martineau.For an R-Rated action movie that at first sight could be seen as a violent and an okey film. There's something hidden through the unoriginal premise, it's of course the character of Kate, a character like many others but it's Winstead's performance and the subtle details of the tragic characters, the way she moves and handles herself through the film. It's also her redemption arc and character development that makes the premise and story work. Cedric Nicolas-Troyan's direction was also surprisingly good. I enjoyed the film a lot but it is far from perfect.",Kate

I didn't care for the opening scene about the ""assassin with a conscious"" or the over played victim role of ""oh woe is me, I'm a victim of bad men"" bit. I think the film would have been better if the story ended when Ani getting in the car with Varrick.

They die slow, in agony, and they know, it's personal.A brand new original Netflix movie starring Woodie Harrelson and Mary Elizabeth Winstead.Stylistically this movie was awesome. Tokyo at night looked vibrant with many colorful neon anime characters. There's a lot of pink, especially in the car chase scene. That was some amazing camera work and reminded me a bit of Baby Driver. Also, the music hyped up the movie throughout.This led to the violent and entertaining fight scenes. This gave some John Wick vibe with some creative use of weapons. In these scenes Mary Winstead was a total badass showing brutality when she kills. She carried every scene and I loved her performance.The biggest problem of the movie was that I could see 99% of the movie from a mile away. Honestly this didn't affect me as much as it should because I loved the style and action a lot.Overall, an enjoyable flick despite the predictable story. 7.5/10.",Kate
35,JohnRayPeterson,It's the Mary Elizabeth Winstead show and she is awesome,8,3 October 2021,"If you like the 'kickass' female characters, the knock' em down, shoot 'em up revenge movies, you're in for a treat. As Quentin Tarantino once said, and I'm paraphrasing, '... it's hard to beat a good revenge movie'. There are basically two movie genres, if one has to oversimplify movies; it's revenge movies and those that aren't. That leaves a lot of in between sub-genres and we each have kinds we like. In this movie, with the exception of one car chase scene which is more like a video game sequence, and not a good one at that, you'll get a lot of revenge, good ole fashion revenge. Kate, out for revenge for whoever poisoned her, and there are a few false leads about that to keep us guessing and on our toes; then there's the Yakuza clan which is out for revenge against her for daring to think she could just barge in. So again, basically, lots of action. But...... a good revenge movie needs also some good acting, good drama. This is where Mary Elizabeth Winstead surprised me, in a very good way. That woman can act. Right up to the very last seconds of the movie, she doesn't hold back the convincing role she plays; she delivers a solid performance throughout. The director must have known she can act because we are not spared the close-up shots of Winstead. You don't do that many close-ups of a character unless they can deliver, and that's where, in my opinion, Mary Elizabeth shines. I wouldn't care for that many close-ups if the actor isn't worth looking at, and yes she is (ok, I think she's hot too). Of course when the title of the movie is the name of your character, you'd better be able to deliver. In closing, just remember to forget that video game car chase scene; you have to get passed it, and it ain't that difficult to do. If I was able to get over it, because I'm not a video game enthusiast period, you will as well.",Kate

I'm literally lost for words to see the adaptability she brings to her performance every freaking time. Not to mention, her allegiance and dedication to these roles are second to none.From a story standpoint; yes, it's a bit cliché and very predictable but that didn't stop me from having a really good time! Neon Lit sets with some of the most gorgeous panning shots around the blocks of Tokyo do add up to its all-embracing world-building.What about the Action Choreography? Well, as you might have guessed already; it's another John Wick wannabe. Pretty much along the lines of one of Netflix's earlier releases this year, i.e. Gunpowder Milkshake. Although I must admit, It's far superior in almost all respects. And much of the credit goes to the Stunt Coordinators and the whole crew who made it happen.Leaving aside technical jargon, let's finally turn our attention to some fundamental stuff. Namely the characters or the Writing for that matter. I feel it's where mistakes were made. Even with an overabundance of talent onboard; writers were simply incapable of making good use of each of their capabilities as out-and-out performers.The creators blatantly miss out on a significant number of opportunities. Thus, in the end; their true intentions had failed to materialize. However, I quite treasured the dynamic between Kate and Ani; still, I wouldn't have minded a little bit more justification and depth in this coalition.",Kate

Kate (Mary Elizabeth Winstead of Scott Pilgrim, Birds of Prey) was an interesting assassin whose last job will be her last... Alongside this cast, we get the every reliable Woody Harrelson that goes from strength to strength.The neon lights of Tokyo is the backdrop for this film. You cannot make a film like that without acknowledging & paying homage to Blade Runner. Her attire is reminiscent of the capcom character Jill Valentine from the Resident Evil franchise. It could not get any more Japanese that it did. She is like the protagonist of Kill Bill that is on a vengeance mission but in Tokyo, Japan. The twist was too obvious for me but it was intriguing & entertaining enough to stretch the whole duration of the film. Well done Netflix for showing a decent film among the cesspools of mediocre ones.",Kate

However, the film was consistently fun to watch and I was never bored at any stage.So to jump into what was good. For me the standout was the cinematography and the Japanese setting. There was some fantastic shots throughout and it was just done really well! The acting was also pretty decent, no complains from me there. And the characters were also very fun. It wasn't too deep, but at the same time there was a good character arc and kept a level of interestingness about them. So all in all I was pretty impressed.My only downside is the predictability of the film. Due to the nature of the plot, you know how the film ends so the journey there needs to be really good (which is was). But, because of that there's no ""twist"" or anything that blows you away.And just throughout the film, you could see where the plot was heading and bingo, it happens. I just wish they added a little something in there that you weren't expecting.Overall though, I did quite enjoy this one! And I would recommend if you're looking for a Friday night film or something!

Miku Martineau gave a good turn as an enjoyable side character, and despite some of the interactions between the two being a little jarring, they made for a fun pair.Aesthetically this film was awesome. It had such a cool vibe to it, injected through the use of lighting and an electric soundtrack. I really can't fault it from this perspective.The action was much better than I expected too. It got properly brutal at times and had some fantastic set pieces. It was well paced throughout and the film never felt like it was dragging.As mentioned, the plot is pretty derivative of the genre, but with a fresh twist of the fact that our protagonist is against the clock.All in a all a very fun and enjoyable watch, and one of the better films of this ilk that I've seen lately.",Kate

The problem is that when Mary Elizabeth Winstead is fighting on screen and not the stunt double, she is so slow that the others involved in the fight scene are clearly waiting for her.

I usually watch anything with Tadanobu Asano, but here, his on-screen time kind of disappoints. Woody is as stiff as a ""board"" on a forgettable role that reminds of Kill Bill.The story neither entertains fully nor dissapoints.. and a flabby ending doesn't help either. As someone else said, ""you've seen this already, just not in this combination"", specially considering the 24-hour limit. There's not much depth, and what you see is what you get.. and in fact, could have ended sooner than it did.It's okay, I guess.Not bad but not memorable, as most late releases.",Kate

director: Cedric Nicolas Troyan
starring: Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Woody Harrelson, Miku Martineau, Tadanobu Asano, Jun Kunimura, Michiel Huisman, Miyavi etcMeticulous and preternaturally skilled, Kate is the perfect specimen of a finely tuned assassin at the height of her game. But when she uncharacteristically blows an assignment targeting a member of the yakuza in Tokyo, she quickly discovers she's been poisoned, a brutally slow execution that gives her less than 24 hours to exact revenge on her killers. As her body swiftly deteriorates, Kate forms an unlikely bond with the teenage daughter of one of her past victims. Kate was entertaining but was disappointing due to all the wasted potential.My first few positives would be the strong action, gore, and cinematography. As well as the great set locations and performances. The action and gore were strong here. The action sequences were very well choreographed, entertaining, and brutal. The gore gave them so much more impact and they were visually stunning contrasting with the brutal killings. The cinematography was also very good. The film had a great visual style that really stood out. The Inclusion of Japanese culture and set locations, as well as neon led to a visually striking film that made it stand out compared to films similar to this. The lead performance from Mary Elizabeth Winstead was excellent, her character was likeable and brutal, who didn't take no crap from anyone. She delivered a passionate and hard-hitting performance, and she proved that she can be a strong action lead.My First few negatives would be how generic and predictable the film was. As well as the underdeveloped villains, rushed pacing and lapses in the logic. This film fell into all the genre tropes, no matter how hard it tried it followed the same recycled formula as previous films before this and the characters were completely one dimensional and copy and paste with the protagonists and antagonists. The film was also very predictable, the twists I could see coming from a mile away and you could tell where the film was going and how it developed, with a lack of surprises to keep it interesting. The villains were also underdeveloped, the film wanted you to stay invested in the villains that weren't in the film until the final act and it didn't work. There was a complete lack of effort to develop them beyond the surface level. I also thought this film had really rushed pacing; it went from one scene to the next so quickly. Never allowing the film to have any depth or allowing it to breathe. It just felt lazily written and lacked basic detail that would have helped with adding more to the characters. I also thought that the films premise wore thin very quickly and there were too many lapses in the logic. The fact that Kate literally had 24 hours to live, and she was still able to miraculously survive so much and still do everything. It was just way too unrealistic and too absurd to be taken seriously.My final few positives would be the strong set up and connection with the villains. As well as the fun and creative scenes and increase in the stakes and tension. Plus, the plot development was decent. I thought the set up for Kate was strong, her having some rules and boundaries to her job made her a more complex and likeable character, whilst also setting up the connections with the villains well due to the family dynamic and revenge for the hit that Kate was on. I also thought there was a lot of fun and creative scenes, especially when it came to the action scenes and car chases. When the film really incorporated and had fun with its visual style and Japanese culture it was so fun and entertaining to watch. The action scenes used their surroundings well and different objects to add impact and showing off the strong choreography, but also did clever contrast with the colour scheme in particular with the darker or light set pieces and contrasting this with the strong gore, also with strong editing that didn't feel rushed or choppy. I also thought that despite the plausibility issues with the plot due to Kate only having 24 hours to live, it did increase the stakes for her character well. As it was a race against the clock for her to get her revenge. And The plot did develop solidly when it slowly revealed more about the true villains that kept me interested for the most part.My final few negatives would be the lack or character depth and background, the annoying characters. As well as the messy structure and final act. This film had a really big missed opportunity in terms of adding depth to its characters. They teased a lot of background with Kate into how she grew up without parents, but they never went into any detail. So, it was hard to connect with the characters or really get an understanding into how she thought beyond the one dimensional. I also found the character of Ani (Miku Martineau) to be very annoying. The performance was solid. But her character was just one big genre trope of the little girl that needed saving, she felt in the way for the whole film and honestly had a very irritating personality. Finally, I thought the plot and final act was structurally a mess. Due to the 24 hours to live side of the plot, the whole film just felt like it was delaying the inevitable. It was one dead end after the other and it never felt like it was going anywhere. It felt incoherent and messy. And when we did get to the final act. The twists and reveals were underwhelming and the predictability of how it all played out really impacted my enjoyment and I lost interest.Overall, Kate boasts strong action and a vibrant visual style. Plus, Mary Elizabeth Winstead makes for a very strong lead. But the film can't escape its genre tropes. And structurally it becomes such a mess that it just becomes an entertaining, but forgettable and recycled assassin movie that has been done countless times before.Overall score 60/100.",Kate
54,MogwaiMovieReviews,When Life Hands You Boom Boom Lemons,6,10 September 2021,"There's actually a lot more to like in this new Netflix offering than one would expect: Mary Elizabeth Winstead makes a surprisingly capable action heroine, and the fight scenes are very well-staged and exciting. She goofs enough times, and faces enough adversity, to protect her from any accusations of being a Mary-Sue, and as a result we buy into her journey an awful lot more than we would a Rey, a Captain Marvel or Black Widow.The dialogue is all filler, and the plot almost a carbon copy of better action films like John Wick, Lucy, Kill Bill, Hanna, Nikita and The Long Kiss Goodnight, but the Tokyo setting and nighttime cinematography look great, and all the actors pull off their roles pretty much faultlessly.All in all, very predictable and containing nothing original of any kind, but a well-made and decent-enough popcorn-muncher if you're in the mood.",Kate
55,ExpendableMan,"""I'll be honest, I'm having a bad night.""",8,18 September 2021,"Kate is a film that offers a very Westernised view of Japan. Neon cars speeding through an overcrowded Tokyo. Novelty vending machines. Yakuza. More neon. It's a film that makes the capital city look like Neo-Tokyo from Akira and turns it into an exotic urban backdrop for Mary Elizabeth Winstead to rack up a bodycount.One dodgy CGI car chase aside though, Kate is lots of fun. Winstead plays the titular assassin like a female John Wick; an indestructible bad ass, a human force of nature and no matter how many injuries she racks up, there's still enough gas in the tank to shoot someone in the forehead.Yes, the 'get revenge before the poison kills you' plot is reminiscent of Crank. Yes, it's part Taken, part Black Rain, three parts John Wick. But Winstead thrives as the bruised and battered heroine, her teenage sidekick is surprisingly endearing and there's a wealth of brutal action sequences. The sight of Scott Pilgrim's crush taking knives to Japanese gangsters was always going to be entertaining and white walls splattered with blood are cool as hell.

65,Boristhemoggy,Surprisingly great action adventure.,7,10 September 2021,"I watched this only because Mary Elizabeth Winstead starred and I am a big fan of her previous films.I did wonder if she could pull it off but as the film progressed it was obvious she was not only pulling it off, but loving it and really getting in the role.There are so many films now with the same storyline, but this feels very different with a fast paced but interesting flow that never leaves you behind, and a leading actor who relishes her role and brings the character totally to life.Well done Mary, a fabulous film.",Kate
66,stevebondi,Pretty decent super-spy revenge thriller with lots of cool action and major twists :-),7,11 September 2021,"Nice hand-to-hand combat by a female action hero with some nods to John Wick! :-).

67,jdring2007,great action and badass protagonist crippled by way too much dialogue and an annoying little girl,7,13 September 2021,"Based in Japan, I already knew to expect annoying music (ultimately that's subjective though). That aside, since I really like Mary Elizabeth Winstead, I was hoping for a sort of female John Wick experience. And, more or less, that's what I got. What I especially enjoyed about it was the humanization of her character, versus the typical sexualization of every female action protagonist ever, it seems. She's not just poisoned, it's radiation. So it's...gross, and rough. Very rough. And they film it realistically, or enough to not be too absurd, although that's not to say the movie doesn't have its ridiculous moments. Essentially the entire film's aesthetic is over the top and flashy, but despite that, Kate (the character) is consistently beaten and bloodied, reminding me of John McClane. Unfortunately the script includes what felt like novels' worth of dialogue, much of it subtitled, and that's not even the filler. The filler is well acted drama that served a purpose. Most of the prolonged dialogue was just repeating what had already been said a dozen times over. The little girl in this movie was less annoying than I exp--oh, wait, now we're halfway through and I can't stand her. Oh well. Woody Harrelson was cool, though, and the action scenes were very satisfying.",Kate
68,grygotis,"A movie I had forgotten about, Atomic Blonde, kept coming to mind. Hmm, I wonder why.",6,13 September 2021,"Nothing much new here. It all felt very familiar because it was. Action, blood, car chases, mayhem galore. I do think we've peaked out on action films unless one is very young and hasn't seen a bazillion of them or they actually have something of interest plot wise or offer something, somehow new. This doesn't, though that does not mean it's terrible or even close. It's just is more of the same, though its Japan location offers some bright and shiny new visions that look good and the music is pretty cool. I've always liked Winstead and she's not bad here, but this doesn't seem to bring out the best in her to me and there is the most annoying child character that I've seen in a while played by a young actress of uninterest. The men are all just target practice for the most part except for Harrelson in a boring role, especially for him. Mildly entertaining.",Kate
69,calicut110,Solid female John Wick,6,25 October 2021,This was a very good action thriller. Lots of twists and turns and good fight scenes. The lead actress is quite good and unstoppable. Woody was good too.,Kate
70,gk303007,"Above average, and nothing more",6,14 September 2021,"Most of the earlier reviews have already clarified about this movie: its known and predictable. And yes, the plot is borrowed from many such version movies, with a twist of Plutonium 204 and night life of Japan. Frankly, i already knew what was going to happen and so sudden outcomes aren't all true. Well, thats that and therefore to me, it is just an above average movie. But be sure, there are good moments in this flick too: like the action sequence techniques of camera stuck to actor, the one we saw in Upgrade by Leigh Whannel. I enjoyed that stuff and so did i here. Another one, that i kind of like these days, is the stick to the point portrayal. No extra cheese but enough to make stuffing good and Eatable.A one time, for sure.",Kate

REALly? Wow...maybe because it didn't have non stop action/violence? Mindless pacing? There WERE times that seemed to lag, so maybe there were scenes that weren't necessary...
but overall, forGETting any of the other, like movies i've seen and sitting down with a bowl of popcorn?Lotsa fun...

72,isaacochoterena,A mix of several movies,4,6 October 2021,"This movie feels like a cross between Birds of Prey, Jolt and many others.With a despicable script, this movie gets boring at a certain point. The script is full of conveniences and is very implausible, the use of green screen effects are bad, the car chase scene is terrible, although the plot twist is not predictable, it is very similar to that of the Jolt movie, it seems that Mary Elizabeth Winstead is playing her role as Birds of Prey in this movie, but she does it well, even the character plot is very similar to what her character in Birds of Prey has, the movie has a lot of script holes and it doesn't make much sense. Highlights are the decently executed action scenes, the makeup, the young co-star's performance, and the not-so-predictable plot twist.The movies are bad and boring at certain points because it feels cyclical, but the action scenes save it from being despicable.",Kate
73,Nightmarelogic,Predictable plot - female leads,6,12 September 2021,I am giving this a decent rating mainly because I like that it had female leads even though there was nothing really new about the story. An assassin blows a big job only to find out she has been fatally poisoned and goes on a rampage to find out who killed her. Along the way she picks up a young woman connected to the guy she was suppose to kill and they have an adventure together. Not much new about the movie but the characters had chemistry and if you like this kind of action you can do worse. The only real problem is that on the 1/0 world of Netflix I am not sure which one to pick. It was not great but not awful. This is where it was just kinda ok would have come in handy.,Kate
74,karinahatem,Boom Boom blahhhh,5,12 September 2021,"Nothing new, same old action story that is predictable with the only different that the lead actor is a female who kicks everyone's ass. Action scenes were good, but you get irritated as Kate seems to get up and continue despite all the kicks, shots and even the poison didn't seem to slow her down. Overall, an ok action movie to pass the time.",Kate
75,silicontourist,Another Strong And Capable Of Holding Her Own Assassin Heroine!,7,14 September 2021,"Mary Elizabeth Winstead is a welcome addition to the line up of tough and smart female assassins films we've been getting served up as of late. She brutally kicks, punches slays everybody who gets in her way yet, you still wonder if she is going to make it to the end. Why? Because a gangster had her poisoned with plutonium and she only has 15 hours to live in order to get her revenge. With a good cast of actors/actresses supporting her she make this an excellent non stop action and bloody vengeance thrill ride! Its a film that should be watched for its own way of telling an old ongoing film tale and not, associated with films of the same ilk. Just because a film is an action or a love story does not make it the same as every other of the same scenario. Its the way the tale is weaved by the star{'s} that makes it stand out. The 3 films that were about the assassin Nikita, and all had different titles, are a good example; I think most female assassin films have been based on the Nikita style...which in turn was based upon ""Naked Killer"". A 1992 Hong Kong erotic thriller film written and produced by Wong Jing, and directed by Clarence Fok Yiu-leung. The film stars Chingmy Yau, Simon Yam and Carrie Ng. The film is regarded as a cult classic.I would like to see Mary Elizabeth Winstead do another action movie heroine just to see if she can vary the style some what.",Kate
76,dfloro,Mary Elizabeth Winstead is Kate Wick,7,10 September 2021,"One of my favorite young actresses in the past decade has been Mary Elizabeth Winstead, showing her versatility in everything from ""Scott Pilgrim vs. The World"" and Season 3 of ""Fargo,"" to last year's ""Birds of Prey"" and 2016's little-seen but wildly creative summer TV show called ""Brain Dead.""Here we have another entry in her growing canon of action shoot-em-ups, simply called ""Kate."" Both she and her co-stars, Woody Harrelson and the new young star, Miku Martineau, are quite good. Cedric Nicolas-Troyan, graduating here from a visual effects artist to full-blown director, copies from more than half a dozen (better) movies by my running count, but puts it all together nicely wrapped up with a bloody bow. I give it a 7/10, including an extra point for laser focus on its two female leads.For anybody who'd like to follow along, here's my list of movies that obviously inspired him, in alphabetical order:ALIEN II

I was totally in my element watching the scenes in Tokyo.Great action, great filming and non-stop entertainment. Very good performances all round. Well done to the whole crew and the film makers!",Kate
79,evans-j34,Its a good enough paat time 5.5,6,25 September 2021,Its up and down in enjoyment some goodish action some not so good. Her abilities slow down too quickly kinda killing the pace of the film. It was predictable but I was entertained most of the way through and felt some emotions at end so would recommend as a good past time. I probably would watch it again.,Kate
80,Shayankhan-7526,Kate really made it up.,7,14 September 2021,Hole movie aside but seriously the character of Kate was fantastic and the way it was played was also fabulous.

81,witra_as,Got a rhythm of predictability but still enjoyable,6,15 September 2021,Critics might be too harsh on this but Cedric Nicolas-Troyan still provided well-staged fight scenes inside vibrant Tokyo night scenery.

85,mr-altex,Awesome ride,9,20 September 2021,"I love this movie. It has everything a good action flick has to have. Simple plot, fairly predictable to not get in the way of action. Some humor injected here and there. Great soundtrack.It is clearly carried by Mary Elizabeth Winstead and her awesome performance and the choreography of the action. It as even more enjoyable than John Wick.Only negative would be the a bit lengthy ending part. It was stretched a bit too long and gradation within timing did not work out that well.Still, after The Protégé we've got another well made action movie with lady as main protagonist. Worked out well.",Kate
86,Wililjam,A spin of old clichés...,7,11 September 2021,"It's a visually great film, with action sort of similar to John Wick (which seems to be the new trend with action films), and the movie is good because of it.It isn't a groundbreaking film, but it is quite entertaining. If you want an action film to watch a quiet Wednesday evening, this film could be for you.",Kate
87,matrixdukenukem,Mary Elizabeth Winstead is amazing!!,7,16 September 2021,"Though there isn't much of character written for her role, and that's the fault of writers, Mary Elizabeth Winstead completely carries this movie and makes it worth watching.As described in summary this movie is one of those race against time movies set in Japan for some reason. I guess inclusion of J-pop and anime inspired action they wanted to make it more fun but for me it didn't do anything.Action choreography is good but they're not doing anything inventive or crazy. Some stunts were great and added the visceral effect to the fights while others showcased Mary Elizabeth Winstead is ready for an Atomic Blonde sequel.I guess some people will be bothered by charater of Ani because she's annoying 70% time but I know what the writers were trying to do. It just didn't work. The direction is fine but camera work is just average. While they do good job with Japanese alleys and sky scrapers and use it to their advantage for action scenes ... The sense of geography of the set is lost thus making it difficult to understand what's going on.Overall this movie is a good weekend watch and it's still more entertaining than many action flicks Netflix churns out.",Kate
88,BijeshNagesh,"Entertaining, Though Unoriginal",6,11 September 2021,"I do not know what it is about Tokyo and action movies that nearly every filmmaker opts for a neo-noir LED-touched city-at-night ambiance that sooner or later features an assassin with a sniper scoping out their target from a rooftop, or similar high vantage point.This in mind, ""Kate"" covered several clichéd tropes with the only original flavour being the titular character's performance as played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead. She brought heart to an otherwise soulless character, namely a ruthless trained-and-paid assassin. It was nice watching Mary toggle various 'modes', anything from compassion, justice, and diligence to duty, vengeance, and reason.Even after watching the film, I was unsure what exactly Woody Harrelson's Varrick (Kate's 'handler') brought to the table that was in any way momentous. Woody was good in his role, though the role gave him little to no room to actually flex his acting muscles.Much the same can be said of Michiel Huisman's Stephen. His entry into Kate's life, and consequent poisoning of her, felt a tad 'convenient'. I was surprised that a highly-trained assassin like Kate wouldn't have seen his like coming, especially considering that she met him in a public bar and took him back home.Ani (Kijima's niece, played by Miku Patricia Martineau) was amazing and compelling in her role. She gave the best performance in this movie, to be honest. Renji (Kijima's advisor, played by Tadanobu Asano), also gave a good performance in ""Kate"". His true agenda to take over the reins of the Oyabun family later came to light and settled his fate.Cedric Nicolas-Troyan did a good job as director, and managed to capture all the essentials of the script and plot crafted by Umair Aleem. There was no 'time wastage' involved in this film, which went on a steady stride along the main plotline that was as unwavering as it was action-driven.I do, however, wish they took more time to come up with something more original. ""Kate"" on Netflix felt contrived, often on a subtle level. Instead of coming across as nuanced, it felt like 'just another action heroine movie', a tag I sorely wished they'd avoided. The film had 'hasty writing' painted all over it.Nathan Barr's musical scoring was good, and kept the tension taut. I would've welcomed more original compositions, though. Just because Japan was the main destination in ""Kate"" did not mean there had to be anime-style music inserts. To be fair to the man, he did make cunning use of Japanese war drums (plus battle chants) and a few contemporary Japanese and other (Bahari's ""Savage"", trailer song) numbers. Check out the entire OST on Tunefind.Lyle Vincent's cinematography didn't quite bring anything new to the action-movie genre, but that again boils down to the limits set by the script. A simplified take on costume design helped establish the underlying theme of the movie. Good work in this regard by Audrey Fisher and Nirachara Wannalai. The make-up department also did noteworthy work on ""Kate"" 2021.The stunts and fight sequences - Geisha house mass assault, Jojima (played by popular guitarist and singer-songwriter Miyavi Lee Ishihara) apartment showdown, the final high-rise office raid - were the real scene-stealers in Netflix's ""Kate"" movie. VFX (especially pertaining to blood and gore) and related teams all did great work to instil the feel and flavour of this action flick in the minds of viewers, myself included.The core 'collateral damage' angle was good, in regards to assassins and others who work in the shadows. Kate's revenge arc - to hunt down Kijima (played by Jun Kunimura) - all the while fighting the poison they used Stephen to infect her with, made for interesting viewing, though not an original one.I still cannot wrap my mind around the fact that the Japanese Yakuza merely poisoned an assassin of Kate's calibre, and used a radiation-based concoction at that. It felt like overkill to me, especially considering the real-life stories that detailed how the Japanese Mafia swiftly, discreetly, and decisively tied up loose ends.When Kate ends up saving Ani (who learned that her uncle Kijima's advisor Renji ordered the hit on her father Kentaro), and the two team up (after some reluctance on Kate's part), the movie picked up pace and flowed adequately to a satisfying conclusion, including and after the point when Ani learned of Kate's direct involvement in her father's assassination.The 2021 Netflix movie ""Kate"" had a handful of strong points, but it wasn't altogether there. Originality took quite a beating, but the film was nevertheless entertaining to watch, at least once anyway.",Kate

She is one of those few actors, who can take a plot that has been done many time in the past & manages to make it work on every level possible. I hope that she gets more roles like this or better yet gets to be in more films, because Winstead has & continues to prove herself as one of the greatest actresses of this or any other generation.If you love action revenge films or if you're a fan of Mary Elizabeth Winstead like me, I highly recommends that you watch this film!",Kate

Absolutely nothing to worry about the plot, coz one can readily expect everything in the first few minutes. No concern, no twist at all. Just watch n don't think.But what is unexpected? I thought it would be comparable to Atomic Blonde, but then turned out Kate was slightly better. It's more adrenaline-pumping, and the cinematography of Osaka's neon night is more dazzling. The J-pop music has been carefully chosen and thus could blend into the film well. In fact the whole move has a perfect bonding between western style assassin n Japanese culture. And i can also a careful equilibrium of traditional eastern Japan and modern westernised Japan. It's the best east-meets-west movie I have watched so far.What do I don't like about the movie?? The zombie makeup. It keeps reminding me that Kate could probably turn and bite people at any time. Has she been poisoned by Z-virus??? See her left eye!!!!Suggestion?

""Kate"" is beautifully shot, has very interesting characters, a surprisingly good heroine, teaches us about life and the importance of honor and when the movie ends, we might be sad that the ride is over.I call this a win and compared to the loads of trash that we had to endure in 2020 and 2021, this is one of the titles that stand out of the average mediocrity.It is not a perfect movie, not by any means, but it is good entertainment.",Kate
97,Luv2Spooge,Way Better Than Expected,9,28 September 2021,"Been a lot of Le Femme Nikita films lately and I agree with most whenever I saw one I just groan. The other one I recently reviewed was Protege and it bombed badly.However, I thought this one was done extremely well. Storywise, you know what to expect, but we don't watch these films for stories right? As long as it is decent, straight shot, and not a lot of plot holes, it will suffice. What we're looking for is acting, action, directing, the filming, etc...So what made this one better than others, such as Protege? First, the action sequences are really good and more so, plenty of them. Protege failed in this area because it tried too hard to fill a convoluted plot, leaving a lot of the film with talking talking talking. However, in Kate, the action was nonstop from the beginning to the end and it does not get boring as they vary - car chase, knife fight, gun fight, 1 on 1, and the finale.The fight scenes were creative, well choreographed, fast but yet you see everything clearly. The movie is more of a serious film like John Wick as opposed to Nobody with a comedic feel, yet it has witty comical moments that helps lighten it a bit and just makes it an overall enjoyable ride.I take 1 star off because my only complaint is how dark of the the film is. I know it is shot at night, but could use a little more lighting in certain areas, fight scenes.",Kate
98,pronitmallick,Same Dish New Name,6,11 September 2021,"Kate is a movie that starts by glocking down a compelling presentation into the chamber. Starting from the first act the presentation travels at a good speed but hits a few bumps in its path as it approaches the 2nd and 3rd act. The main focus of the movie Mary Elizabeth Winstead has delivered a performance that fits into the magazines of expectations. The story and the elements of this movie don't appear in front of us as something really new or completely different, instead it feeds us the food with some of the old recipes we have already tasted before. Director Cedric Nicolas-Troyan has given his best to grab us on the seat with the presentation itself as it works till a certain level. After that we start to get bored a little and just wanna skip to the end to see the final outcome, especially when things starts to become quite predictable. The action scenes seasoned the presentation in a good way but it could have been more spicy. Overall it's a film you can definitely watch with a glass of soda in your hand. In terms of watching it is mixed where some people would wanna watch it again and others don't.",Kate

It has a solid storyline, even though it feels like something one has watched before, literally we got Gunpowder Milkshake just a few months before getting Kate.If you love action movies, you will not be disappointed by Kate. It has all the amazing fight and shooting scenes, betrayal, purpose-driven protagonist, and the final all predictable faceoff protagonist and antagonist.

A generic movie with an overused lazy story (including the ""twist"" in the end) must at least have awesome action going for it, like John Wick.Not only that, they do the most boring thing they can ever do with a hero in a movie; to take away their powers in some way, which is literally removing momentum and action ...from an action movie.",Kate

They tried to make a female John Wick but it more like Scarlett Johansson's flick, Lucy instead.Mary Elizabeth Winstead is not badass enough, Charlize Theron and Karen Gillan were more badass in Atomic Blonde & Gunpowder Milkshake. Karen Gillan is the winner for being more badass in Milkshake than Mary. Woody Harrelson is wasted in this and didn't have much screentime. There were no chemistry between him and Mary. It were suppose father figure and protegee relationship.It's an okay movie, but trailer made it look interesting. It falls under ""good trailer, mediocre movie"". I think I'll stick to Gunpowder Milkshake and the next movie I will be watch The Protege with Maggie Q, Michael Keaton and Samuel L. Jackson instead.",Kate
111,NestorTheGreat,Kung Fu Nikita Vs The Yakuza,7,12 September 2021,"Scott Pilgrim's new girlfriend is all grown up and must kill exes of another kind! Until the muddled ending, this action film is like every other revenge one, except the assassin seeking it only has a limited window in which to complete her task.Super-trained by a father figure, played by a mean version of Woody Harrelson, Kate kills with extreme prejudice and precision. That is, until a kid gets in her sights!To find the culprit of her death sentence, she must befriend said child, and even teach her a few of her tricks and secrets. There's not much heartfelt bonding here, and yet they'll defend each other to their deaths, if needed!The muddled meeting between target and killer, photos and gunshot sound effects do not answer the unnecessary flashbacks and the relationship between child and Kate. A well worn tale, told woefully weakly, but lifted by its balletic fight sequences in tight spaces. Not one to skip but shouldn't be missed.",Kate
112,mrrcave,Definitely worth an 8/10,8,25 October 2021,"Storyline was okay. It was interesting from the point of view of some of Japanese culture. Mary Elizabeth Winstead was outstanding and a ""Ripley"" to boot. She kinda suits a rugged vigilante type in a attractive sort of way. Woody was Woody - his acting leaves little scope and his demeanor and lines could have been equally at home in Zombieland or some other action film.Worth watching. I enjoyed it for the 2nd time.",Kate

114,heidibokor,I Liked It,7,6 November 2021,"Yes....it's got a premise like Atomic Blonde, John Wick, Peppermint, and all those other types of movies, but what sets this one apart is that there is no fluff thrown in there and the ending is different finally. Does it have its issues...sure....but the action is great, the story (while similar to other stories along this line) is great, and the lead actress is actually a pretty good action star. It's an enjoyable watch. Just turn your brain off and enjoy it for what it is....a plan old good action flick!",Kate
115,leonmessyb,I really enjoyed it,7,12 September 2021,"Some really good fight scenes and great attention to injury detail!! If you enjoy brutal killings like Raid for example, you will know this. Not saying it's as good as Raid by any means, I just mean the killings are just as graphic. Great action film, entertains. Couple parts are predictable but still WELL worth the watch!",Kate
116,alexqueens,Kick-ass Winstead,7,13 October 2021,"First off, I'm biased, because of Mary Elizabeth Winstead. Plus she's the lead, and is present on screen 97% of the time in Kate, so we're looking at a winning formula here.Despite the annoying kid tag-along plot, Woody phoning it in, Japan's golden boy Tadanobu Asano being wasted in a mediocre role, and the tired old cliché of being double-crossed by those closest to you, this is still a Crank version of Mary doing her very own John Wick thing.So it's a shame that this begins with her having only 24 hours to live and having to extract her revenge in that short timeframe, because I would very much like 5 more sequels of Mary shooting, stabbing and kicking all the people that make it onto her naughty list.So if they fancy bringing her back to life through some bogus plot device for the sake of making a Kate 2: Crank it Up, I'm not gonna complain. In fact, I'll even pay Netflix a little extra just to think about it.",Kate
117,ty-jensen,Winstead is badass!,5,12 September 2021,"Netflix, maybe every major streaming service is cranking out content. Someone at Netflix recently stated they will work harder on their movies. I was excited for Kate but my expectations were low. Kate is another serviceable action movie, its a female version of Crank.The acting is good or you could say its good for an action movie. Yes, Mary Elizabeth Winstead gives the best performance. The kid is good but some people may find her annoying. Woody Harrelson is good but I'm sure some people feel he phoned it in.The plot is cliche, you know what's going to happen from beginning to end. There's a huge twist but it doesn't work. I like to see more of Kate's training which easily could of made a film or a miniseries.The action scenes are fun, they're brutal and stylish. Kate isn't portrayed as a superhero which is nice. If Kate wasn't poisoned, I guess she would still struggle. Winstead is good in the action scenes so she should make more action movies.Overall, Kate was okay. It's one of those movies you see only once or twice. If you have Netflix, you might as well see it.",Kate
118,SimonSaysSmallScreen,Not just a bland Crank remake,7,12 September 2021,"So, I thought, basically the same premise as Crank, but that was a lot better. Crank had all the absurd magical anti-realistic action that makes this kind of silliness really entertaining: falling out of airplanes and organ transplants and such. Crank had raw sexual compulsion instead of this Disney-version teenage idolatry. But, then it turns out there is another twist, a plot layer that makes it a whole different movie. Enjoy!",Kate
119,lakings97,Another version of Le Femme,7,20 September 2021,Kate is a Netflix movie centered around a female assassin much like Hanna on Amazon Prime and Atomic Blonde that stared Charlize Theron. This one Mary Elizabeth Winstead along with her handler played by Woody Harrelson. Kate failed to deliver on a job and she ends up poisoned and only has 24 hours to seek revenge on her murderer before she dies. The flick reminded me of Kill Bill and Le Femme Nikita but set in Japan with great visuals and action sequences. It was a good movie and I would definitely watch it again.,Kate

121,yowilwasup,Definitely on my recommendation list,10,13 September 2021,"Nothing new plot wise. It all been done before. That doesn't make this movie any less enjoyable. Mary Elizabeth Winstead makes an excellent action star. She's an authentic and beautiful actress. She handles the action sequences with athleticism, grace and ferocity. Miku Martineau is a charming and talented young actress and quite a discovery. A very likable actress. Winstead can kick ass and look great doing it. And Martineau looks to have a great future. Don't put this on your watch list... just watch it.",Kate
122,brentn,Kate Kills It!!,7,25 September 2021,"I am pretty neutral regarding Mary Elizabeth-Winstead but ever since Birds of Prey and now this, I can honestly say she is awesome and I'm now a fan. Although, this movie has an unoriginal plot similar to Crank, Edge of Darkness, 3 Days to Kill, DOA, Atomic Blonde and others. Kate gives more of a Nobody (2021) type feel. I enjoy it when the protagonist is more human and vulnerable because it gives a greater sense of relatability to the character from the audience which means there's more root for. The fight sequences were well done and absolutely brutal. The story had a stylish approach without meandering around and wasting time. The characters were interesting and some of the unassuming ones were actually serious foes. I think the best part was that Kate is a smart and relentless character, one that is able to take a beating and not just dish it out and not get a scratch. Watch and enjoy!7/10.",Kate
123,johnnyhbtvs27,Kateson,6,10 September 2021,Good fun action thriller with a great turn by Mary Elizabeth Winstead.

128,matty_mushroom1983,Mary Elizabeth Winstead comes that little bit closer to a favourite,7,10 September 2021,"Majority credit to her ability to feel her role, to empathise with the story and deliver humanity through her character. She was just as impressive in Fargo, where I first encountered her. It takes true talent to convince ME that your character is simultaneously cold blooded and warm hearted.As for the flick itself, the action is real enough in that the protagonist displays the ability to f-s-up but will fumble with fatigue and sickness, misjudge enough to be outweighed by an opponent not necessarily of an equal skill set.The usual sacrifice of substantial plot and believability of her opponents' characters remains as with any martial arts snd/or action flick, which isn't necessarily something to frown upon. In fact if the opposite were the case it would be an instant 10 stars.",Kate

No, it does not look like that. Dirty streets in Tokyo are not that dirty.Giving money and leaving with the restaurant owner saying thanks? No, he'd chase you to give the change, there is no ""keep the change"" in Japan.There are more examples and it's a little annoying but the worst part is having the niece not talk a good Japanese... She has a stronger accent than mine! And the Japanese dialogues are often very bad! It really felt like someone who learned Japanese abroad wrote those lines...

133,mistabobdobolina,"Winstead is great, everything else is stale",6,11 September 2021,"Hitwoman-seeks-redemption movies are getting to be common enough to have their own particular cliches, which I guess is cool enough in a way, but... they're still cliches. I felt a powerful sense of the familiar watching Kate, not necessarily in a good way, as our badass heroine mows down mooks, develops a relationship with an innocent girl who reminds her of her younger self, and unravels a gnarly plot that (and this ""twist"" barely merits a spoiler tag given how obvious it is that it's coming) ultimately leads back to those closest to her.Kate is more than just a mashup of hitwoman-with-a-heart-of-gold tropes, to be fair. It also mashes up a lot of other tropes either borrowed from standard-issue shoot-em-ups more generally -- yakuza as samurai in suits, clash-of-East-vs.-West plot points that were last fresh in the Nineties, the assassin who paints a target on themselves by wanting to leave the life -- or kited from more ambitious and original films (the device of a countdown to the protagonist's inevitable death is right out of the old Statham vehicle Crank). And there are plenty of callouts and Easter Eggs referencing the kind of classic action movie that Kate does not seem to aspire to being (including a backstory flashback straight out of La Femme Nikita).It's still watchable thanks to some great set-piece throwdowns and to Mary Elizabeth Winstead, who sells all of it with confidence. Winstead is the real deal as an action star and is fun to watch. It's a pity the movie around her isn't better.",Kate
134,wwiiboomer,Great Action Pack Female Thriller,7,12 September 2021,"Mary Elizabeth Winstead, has certainly come a long way in her career to portray a female action figure that she does very well & convincingly. They say revenge is better served cold. That said, there's so many variations that lends to this idiom. I highly recommend this show that will livened up your day or evening!

137,northernpaladin,Bad Ass,7,28 September 2021,"I've just seen Mary Elizabeth Winstead in Gemini where frankly she was the only character worth watching and out acted Will Smith despite a poor script. In this she completely owns the movie and proves that 'empowered females' are possible without all the woke baggage and studio preaching we've had with characters like Captain Marvel and Black Widow.The plot is nothing revolutionary; assassin wants to pack it up, is betrayed by someone and poisoned so has 24 hours to find the betrayer and exact revenge. The similarity to Gemini is obvious (but this is SO much better) but this is more of a throw back to Nikita with a bit of DOA thrown in.Setting the film in the Japanese crime scene allows us to indulge in the whole Yakuza honour vibe while at the same time playing with the extreme anime/pop culture scene which is modern urban Japan.The gunfights are well staged and gritty giving a real sense of danger. In terms of gunfight length, damage the chief protagonist can take, impossible athleticism and inability to shoot straight by the opposition we are definitely in John Wick territory but while that became extremely Irritating after a while this does not and that is good thing.Like all films of this type the characters have very little depth, which is to expected, but Winstead does a cracking job of making the best of it and making the audience care about her journey. Again, like most films of the genre, the plot is simple and linear with a large dose of suspension of disbelief but unlike many of its ilk it works well enough for you to pay attention and not get distracted by your phone; at the end I thought ""you know what I could watch that again"".This isn't awards material and is self aware enough to not try for that but for its genre it is definitely time well spent and we could do worse than see more of Winstead on our screens.",Kate
138,michelleoverton,Just don't like it,2,12 September 2021,I tried really hard to like this movie but it was so under-whelming! Slow action and story line was bad. Some of the fighting stunts were entertaining but that's about it. I wouldn't watch it again that's for certain.,Kate
139,bbevis-47954,Boom Boom Lemon Yes Please!,7,10 September 2021,"Kate is a better than average female assassin movie. Which is a breathe of fresh air compared to other offerings in the genre such as Netflix's Gunpower Turdshake.The lead that didn't work in the ladder works tremendously well in Kate. Mary Elizabeth Winstead has charisma and she is not afraid to get ugly in this movie. By the hour mark Kate is bloodied and beaten half to death with the scars to prove it. The grittiness lends a lot to the believability of her character despite her being as thin as a paper clip. Nonetheless, in most of the action scenes the actress is on screen performing her own stunts a majority of the time, and she really helps Kate be a better movie than what it could have been with a different star.If you're interested in the action needless to say it does the job and most action aficionados like myself will be satisfied. Nothing in the film will make your jaw drop action wise but that doesn't mean it's not well staged or not entertaining. The action is bloody, the cinematography is clean and the choreography is respectable.When the action is not on screen you may have your attention lead elsewhere but the movie never overstays its welcome.Another aspect of Kate people may dislike is the ""babysitting"" moments of the film. None of these moments hurt the overall movie in my opinion. However there was one moment after a fight sequence where the young girl Ani assists Kate by tracking someone down using ""Cellular Tracking"" as the young girl mentions. It was hard not to cringe when I thought to myself isn't Kate an elite assassin who would have thought of that herself? Whatever, Kate isn't meant to be a dramatic masterpiece of screenwriting excellence.One action criticism I forgot to mention was the car chase sequence in the beginning of the film. Please don't judge the rest of the action based off this sequence. The scene may look neat with the neon lights but the CGI was terrible and this may turn a few viewers off.With a few working brain cells anyone can see the twist coming in the third act. Kate is as derivative as it is competent and I think the film will split action fans. If you're a part of the target audience go grab a boom boom lemon and you may find yourself entertained during Kate's brief running time.",Kate
140,jannikpeveling,Not bad but nothing you will remember,5,16 September 2021,"Positive things first: I really liked the action, the brutality in the fights and they didn't cut away in the last moments. It feels more real.The story is meh. Already seen a hundret of times and for me pretty predictable and obvious since the beginning and sometimes even annoying and uncomfortable to watch.Not really bad, but definitly nothing you will ever remember to have seen at all.",Kate
141,TheLegendOfThe42,"Same old story, only worse",1,6 October 2021,"Writing seems to be a rare gift these days. It baffles me that scripts as poor as this one get greenlit by people who should be smart enough to know better.John Wick really opened up a lot of huge doors for 87Eleven North, but all they do is beating their one trick pony: assassin goes rogue in nice lighting - John Wick, Atomic Blonde, Nobody and now Kate. It's getting tiresome.What makes this rendition of the same old story especially hard to watch is the stupid, predictable plot and some poorly performed and edited fight scenes. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is a good actress, but unfortunately, she is not very skilled when it comes to action. The fights are slow, her movement weak and unconvincing, contrasted by the overly intense reactions of her opponents, making it even more unbelievable. The editing jumps a lot to suggest speed, but to no avail.Also, all of this is just too much to buy. A dying woman is still way stronger than healthy, young Yakuza killers? Yes, except if they're gay, it seems. Please, my suspension of disbelief only goes so far.The so-called ""twist"" is obvious from the beginning. A toddler could have written something more suspenseful and original than this.Kate herself as a character is dull, flat and never makes you care about her. As a result, all the action fails to be engaging. It doesn't really help that she's also not likeable or smart or even justified in her actions if you think about it.The visual style is a bit tired at this point, but still nice to watch, and the setting in Japan carries this whole tedious film, to be honest. But the unbelievably naive and stupid plot, bad pacing, and the poorly written characters and dialogue render this film into yet another trivial, obnoxious empowerment story and yet another failed attempt at writing a strong female lead.",Kate
142,roondogbb,This movie is highly and unfairly underrated.,9,16 September 2021,"This movie tells the story of an Assassin Kate who early on in the movie finds herself in the unfortunate situation of having only 24 hours or less to live. She does what anyone would do in that situation. She seeks revenge. The plot is rather predictable from a start to finish standpoint, however the journey of the movie takes you on to get from A to B can still be excellent even if guessing the end is rather simple... Similar to the movie Titanic, everyone know that the ship sinks and Rose survives, but that's not the point..... During the movie Kate ends up with a young japanese girl, who has a lot of attitude and charisma and tags along with as she reaches her destination, although saying much more would lead to spoiler territory unfortuantly. What makes this movie great is the performace Mary Winstead as Kate, seeing her as a badass assassin is very believable and she's likeable as a character.Another aspect of this movie which makes it what it is, is the location. Tokyo Japan, with it unique style, sets it out from any other city in the world. The neon colours are here, pink especially, beautiful shots in 4k of the Tokyo at night from the sky. Other little things, such as the street markets, a Jpop concert etc. Really add to the excellent cinematography. On top the cinematrogrphy the sound in this film was top notch. Just little details like hearing cat in the small streets. I know that most reviewers only concentrate on the narrative but there are more elements to a movie and action movies such as Kate don't need to be narrative heavy. Just enough so to have a logical and midly intereating story.The movie also has some a lot of heart, seeing the relationship between Kate and Ani was great. There were some nice little comedic moments in the movie and the referencing to boom boom lemon was funny. So overall a movie that I enjoyed at a 10/10 for the genre of movie it is. Its one of the best I've seen.",Kate
143,guskeller,Cool visuals and action but lacks lasting impression,6,17 September 2021,"Netflix's Kate is a tough one to pin down. In many ways it is poor, but in other ways it is reasonable. The broad premise of a female assassin on a rampage is tired, but the ticking-clock aspect gives viewers more to digest. The acting is occasionally grating because Woody Harrelson is disengaged and Miku Martineau struggles through her obnoxious character. However, Mary Elizabeth Winstead rescues that front with solid efforts to elevate the material. Meanwhile, the cinematography is clearly the highlight of the film because of the lively camera movements during action scenes and the slick lighting throughout.Unfortunately, none of these positives are impactful enough to carry this project to a meaningful reception. Even the effects, which are generally engaging, have their glaring misfires: a completely CGIed car chase, for example, totally distracts and undermines the illusion. The edits are energized, the sound is dense, and the soundtrack is fitting, but none of these aspects push Kate to a memorable level. Ultimately, most of the visuals and some of the action might satisfy sporadic audiences but, beyond that, there isn't enough here to truly leave an impression.Writing: 4/10

A decent storyline revolves around an assassin attempting to kill someone who is trying to kill her. En route, she befriends the daughter of one of her lastest targets resulting in subtle complexity to the plot, adding another element to a more than satisfactory yet predictable film.Thank you for the blood splatter on the screen; this made the fighting scenes feel like I was playing a video game.Verdict: Kate delivers an action-packed, effectively paced film. If you like movies like John Wick, well thus cannot tickle your itch while having a Netflix subscription. A decent story that focuses on its strength of fighting yet still establishes a predictable plot. Am I in paradise after watching this? We are getting there 😆🏝",Kate
145,shawthingproductions,A nice surprise,6,12 September 2021,"Bored, I put this on last night and when it came to the CGI car chase, I nearly turned it off and stuck my foot through the television in frustration. But, I'm glad I didn't.A film that borrows way too heavily from both Leon and Crank (rising no where near the brilliance of Leon, I hasten to add), this was actually a surprisingly fun film. Sure there is very little originality in it but the action sequences are pretty much non-stop with some real nifty camera work in there.Don't expect shocks or twists or surprises because you'll most likely know everything from start to finish within the first 20 minutes if you've engaged your brain but if you just want mindless action, shoot-outs and bone crunching then turn your brain off and go for the ride (just don't turn it off at the CGI car chase)...",Kate

156,jdgan,Still the same Boom Boom Lemon but just as tasty as before,9,4 October 2021,"Despite the critical reviews, this actually is a good film and is one of Netflix's better offerings in recent months. Mary Elizabeth Winstead continues her hot streak from Birds of Prey by playing Kate, an assassin who is poisoned during her final job and has the night to find who did it. And it's incurable.Writing-wise, I thought it was gonna suck since I had read the original screenplay from 2017 and thought it sucked. To my surprise, I found the final product to be much better than I expected. The characters felt improved, the drama felt a lot better, it felt more streamlined and it flowed better, and even the dialogue is an improvement. Overall, the writing on it's own is serviceable and provides a sturdy enough structure for the film.Cedric Nicholas-Troyan is our director here, and compared to his previous film (The Huntsman Winter's War), this is a massive step-up. Tokyo looks visually beautiful, courtesy of Lyle Vincent's (A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night) cinematography. The action scenes are also slickly shot and seamlessly edited.Nathan Barr's score is something that I should mention as well. He combines Japanese instruments with modern electronic elements to create this unique score that deserves a lot more attention that it's getting right now. He has already proven himself as a unique composer with his scores to Carnival Row and The Americans and here, he's done it again.To conclude, this might be predictable, but in truth, is a competently made action film that's a cut above what usually on Netflix nowadays.",Kate
157,S_dot_M_dot,The Good Outweighs the Bad,6,17 September 2021,"As the clock ticks, assassin Kate (Mary Elizabeth Winston) seeks revenge the one who murdered her. Guided by her mentor Varrick (Woody Harrelson) and accompanied by Ani (Miku Patricia Martineau) through the Tokyo underground as bodies begin to pile up.This film is quick pace and high energy throughout. It does have time to breathe, but it knows where it wants to take the audience and doesn't let up. The camera is always moving and keeps bringing you deeper into the fantastic production design. The color palette is very vibrant and fits the high energy aesthetic.The action is on display in full force. The hand to hand combat scenes are choreographed and shot with precision and the weapons are well thought out. Mary Elizabeth Winston is fantastic as our protagonist and fits well with the action.While the action is the focal point of this film, they should have added more hand to hand combat. That is the element that seemed to shine the brightest. The story set-up is a nice touch but everything is predictable. There is nothing new offered in terms of plot line, although most of the cast does fine work at letting the audience suspend their beliefs.This isn't the first, or will it be the last we see a film that follows this same trajectory, but that doesn't mean you can't enjoy them. This is a great popcorn flick that will keep you on the edge of your seat at times.",Kate
158,floydbastable,What's not to like?,9,13 September 2021,"Wasn't expecting anything from this. Just thought it was another low key filler. But hold on, I loved it. What's not to like? Action, manga'ish, and fun.",Kate

160,Camerenth,Purely average action movie,6,12 September 2021,This movie is competent for an action movie of the same category as John Wick and Atomic blonde. A tad bit more stylish than others but way to predictable in story. Mary does pull off the badass type but the plot doesn't do her favors.,Kate
161,charleslanobucklin,Cool Revenge Movie,10,12 September 2021,I'm gonna give this movie ten points just to give its rating a bump.While this won't win any awards for originality - this movie reminds me of several of my favorites. Blade Runner comes to mind as the main character (Kate) has to deal with her rapidly impending demise - very similar to Rutger Hauer's character in the aforementioned movie.The scenes are well shot and the Tokyo background adds to the excitement. The action scenes are Amazing.Kudos go To Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Kate - she is one badass lady in this film.This is a great popcorn movie that deserves a look. Ignore the naysayers and check it out.,Kate
162,gary_sites,Give me some Boom Boom Lemon,1,14 September 2021,"If you like lots of blood and gore, and a totally predictable plot, you might like this one.

164,palistineroyal,I don't get why they keep making movies from formulas,3,17 September 2021,"Oh wait......$
Dumb and predictable, cool action scenes and decent acting. The story is so rushed and the characters are forced onto us without any real character buildup, because they don't have time to most likely. The little girl goes from normal girl to traumatized girl, to psychopath by the end. This movie felt like it could've been better. Mainly because it was done better by movies such as John Wick or Crank.",Kate
165,sithstalker-75789,All I want is a good fashioned car chase,4,22 September 2021,Instead we get 2 minutes if that of some god awful cgi car chase and then she totals it smh. The stories basically crank but not as much fun.You wanna see a decent female assassin film watch Colombiana or the Killl Bill films. Only reason this film gets 4 stars is coz of woody harleson and the beautiful Japan setting.,Kate
166,tkdlifemagazine,The Sum is Greater Than the Parts,7,14 September 2021,"I read a lot of negative critic reviews of this one. I disagree. This is surprisingly good. The story of a hit woman with 24 hours to live is interesting and well executed. Japan is as much a character as any actor and she is terrific to look at and marvel. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is very good in the lead role. Woody Harrison is his usually interesting screen presence. The supporting cast, especially the young woman playing Ani, are very good. There is a major plot weakness I won't spoil and the fight choreography is not the best, but the overall film is very watchable and unique. I recommend this one. The whole here is greater than the sum of the parts. ThIs is better than Gunpowder Milkshake despite some reviews to the contrary.",Kate

169,jacoblawrence-19058,Predictable But Enjoyable,6,4 October 2021,"The beginning and the end of Kate are pretty much the exact same as every other movie about an assassin who wants out of the business. However, the middle of the film is actually pretty good. A charmingly cool performance by Winstead and some fragments of capable filmmaking hold this action flick together, but in this case, the whole is not greater than the sum of its parts.",Kate
170,phillip-henry,A modern day Crank,7,12 September 2021,"The whole basis of the story is similar to Crank with Jason Statham, Mary Elizabeth Winstead plays her role really well with a great supporting cast, set in a modern Japan interspersed with live action Anime is such a modern and refreshing take.",Kate
171,ksharath1999,Tries to be different ends up in cliche,6,18 September 2021,"Kate really felt like a realistic journey with an assassin despite the stylish climax. The film opens with a surprising intense sequence which provides the fuel on which the whole thing drives on. Realistic Hardcore action sequences are the core of the movie which is none like usual goosebumps invoker masala action. All the action sequences are well done and adds to the main highlight of the movie. All the actors have done their part in empowering this thin plot film, Especially Mary Winstead's fierce assassin is worth a praise. Surprisingly Mika Martineau too impresses out of nowhere and the kid-girl chemistry works out well and adds to the delights of the movie.Last but not the least, the usage of Japanese backdrop,short flash backs, songs and frames in a short run time deserve praise.Although the film almost had everything it is outweighed by numerous cons including Netflix's bad poster marketing startegy that only ruins the major highlight of the movie. The movie tried hard to be different but in the end reverts back to the same cliche assassin storyline as usual. As the movie only uses realistic r rated action factors there is no goosebumps worth moments in the movie.In the end, Netflix had all ingredients to make a good movie but yet again makes a average watchable movie which has one of the best action sequences of the year.Rating:60%",Kate
172,incubus-0914,"Predictable, yet nicely done!",7,10 September 2021,"I have been a fan of Mary Elizabeth Winstead for a quite long time and have watched many movies that she's in. One thing for sure for me is whatever a role she takes, she always gives a very convincing job, from an innocent cheerleader, and a charismatic girlfriend to a brainwashed cult member. This is no exception either.Like some other reviewers say, this movie definitely has vibes of some of Luc Besson's works such as ""Lucy (2014)"", ""Nikita (1990)"", and also reminds me of ""Gunpowder Milkshake (2021)"" which centered a conscientious female hitman, and maybe tiny bit of Oren Ishii from ""Kill Bill (2003), precisely her back story. The story of this film is pretty straight forward and probably you've seen something similar before, but Mary really carries this whole 106 min well. She's slim though not like skin and bone, her physique looks fit. She appears very much capable of this type of action more than many actresses I've seen in other action films. The fighting scenes are not full of grappling or jiujitsu which can be a problem when convincing an audience if the protagonist is a woman who weighs less than 120lb. What this movie has done right is portraying the female hitman as a skilled knife killer. She aims at opponents' fatal points accurately and makes sure to hit there multiple times. In this way, it doesn't matter how much she weighs, she just needs to be agile and lethal that I believe this film displayed very well. I really liked the action scenes and Mary Elizabeth Winstead handled them superbly.I can tell many parts of this film was actually shot in Japan and most of Japanese are real Japanese actors, some (especially Kijima and Renji) are famous in Japan. Scenery and many of products in the background are genuine, and the cab which door opens and closes automatically! I appreciate that they try hard to stick to the authenticity.There are a few gripes if I may... are that Ani (Miku Patricia Martineau) who's supposed to have grown up in Japan doesn't speak Japanese very well, the small izakaya filled back alley looked like a studio set, and one more thing is a magical auto-reloaded gun which Kate steals from a cop. I was worried that eventually Kate was going to run out of bullets, but it never happened lol Nonetheless, these are minuscule details, they aren't enough to taint this movie.I don't believe this is a solid 10 star movie, but deserves 6 or 7 stars no doubt. Certainly fun to watch especially for a person who enjoys action films with female leads.",Kate
173,sadako11,Ripley killing yakuza,4,14 September 2021,Maybe is just me but Mary Elizabeth Winstead character looks and acts like Sigourney Weaver's Ripley from Alien. Pay attention and u will notice that Ripley and Kate almost look the same even had some of the same mannerisms.Overall the movie was bland and generic. The fighting sequences while ambitious were not tight. Example: a yakuza swinging a knife or a punch at Kate but missing his mark by about two feet!!,Kate

I was sitting there thinking meh.. What happened to the ""Belivable bad ass woman"" like Sarah Connor, Ripley, or even the Bride. I was about to give it up but the tail end of the film She Totally sold it! John Mclane style! All beat up and pushing on. The end is a well played nod to classic Westetns and Samurai films.

Mary E- total legend, she should be in more.Only downfall is it's 30 mins to long, There's really could have been more action, hence the 6.It's still worth your time, fun weekend movie to tune out and just enjoy the film for what it is.",Kate

181,hydralien-40230,Mediocrity games,4,27 September 2021,"There are action movies where the things are measured just so they work - character frowns for just the right time to be remarkable but not too long to be awkward, sidekicks are acting annoying but to the point before it gets dull or overacted and not beyond that, the plot is simple but somehow characters' actions are still justified.Sadly, this movie is not like that - the reasons for anything that happens in it are just so... dull. It's a mixture of a different previously depicted ideas - some are like Crank, some are like Polar, some are closer to John Wick, some remind Shoot'em Up - but all those ideas were enacted better, more sharp and more colourful before. Here, it's just a bland weak cocktail. And the Ani's character is the most annoying and overacted of them all - not that any actor really shines there (not even Woody Harrelson, even though he stands out the most), but she's remarkably irritative.It's shot quite well - the costumes, the surroundings, all the pictures are great, but every scene is just a tad bit too long and too unbalanced to the point it becomes bland and stale. It's... mediocre.",Kate

183,gregoryblanch88,Where for art thou car chase...,5,18 September 2021,"There used to be a name for flicks like these, potboilers. Movies that are cranked out to fill the release schedule and pad content. Kate is more of a pot simmerer (oh its a word bro, it's a word).The eponymous character is your usual Super Assassin, trained from childhood, frosty, able to take out 18 black ops types before breakfast yada yada. Of course Super Assassin Rule No. 1 - no kids goes without saying.BTW I've always wondered what the cut-off age is - 16,17, getting the braces off, or when they just look old enough to snuff...but I digress.Kate suffers from uneven performances by Mary and Woody (Toy story? NO! FOCUS!) and an abundance of randomly connected scenes, leading to the most predictable, tension free ending possible. Just ONE twist would have been appreciated.But we have to talk about the car chase - only the car Kate drives is CGI, bad CGI. Oh my. Its so bizarre I burst out laughing halfway through what was supposed to be a intense chase by a Yakuza goon squad. She may as well have hitched a ride with Dumbo or Peter Pan. It compromises the integrity of the movie beyond redemption and it never gets the mojo back.There were moments during Kate when the actors put their humanity on display, and these are the best ones for me. They are overshadowed by lumpy editing and a sense that the director wasn't quite sure what movie he was making. Next time get enough budget for a real car chase, that's the thing that saved 6 Underground after all.This one should disappear into the Realm of Forgotten Movies (Oh it's a place bro, it's a place). If we still had DVD's it would be straight in the $2 bin.",Kate
184,kuner-59029,"Predictable, derivative, uninspired",5,10 September 2021,"The second female John Wick rip off in just a month. Based on the trailer I had somewhat high hopes for this one, daring to believe it would deliver some classic John Woo style heroic bloodshed. Yet it's another letdown, just like Jolt, Atomic Blonde, The Protégé and so many others.Mary Elizabeth Winstead does a fine job as the lead, but shares no chemistry with the kid she's saddled with. A lot of the Japanese actors sleepwalk through their roles, except for the big boss and the effeminate one. Woody Harrelson does his bit and is reliable as ever, even if he doesn't have much to work with.The photography was unexpectedly dull, the use of music often didn't work, and worse, a lot of the kicks and punches lacked precision and speed. MEW has the acting chops, but isn't a fighter. They would need someone like Gina Carano or some MMA fighter to pull this off convincingly.Another aspect these John Wick and Crank ripoff movies lack is fun. While John Wick's humor was found mostly in its timing or interactions, and Crank was just an all out cartoon, these new movies don't seem to understand their own genre. They play it straight when they shouldn't, and wink at the audience in a completely self-oblivious manner, as in ""haha, aren't we outrageous?"". John Wick or Crank never tried to trick the audience into thinking they're watching something edgy. The outrageous scenes happened naturally within the context of the story. The tonality of the humor fit the story.Kate is a tonal mess, switching from gory dismemberment to J-Pop music to Kate coming to terms with her life ending and scenes of bonding and redemption, to wanna be Japanese crime drama to total schlock again. It feels like a movie put together by a committee checking off boxes instead of a singular artistic vision.Darn shame. A generous 5/10 for gorehounds and fans of the genre. You can certainly do worse, but you can do a whole lot better, too.",Kate
185,prairiewalker,Enjoyed It,9,11 September 2021,"Very nicely done by Mary Elizabeth. She's always good. Different, and worth your time.",Kate
186,Kazombie,"Good start, weak mid and weaker end",4,11 September 2021,This movie borrows from films like Leon the professional and John Wick etc. So much so that it has no soul and character of its own. It's basically a rip off of Leon with the intense gory kills to mimic John Wick. There's no strong story here and the 'twist' is obvious from the beginning.Not recommended.,Kate
187,stal-13652,Enjoyable but predictable,6,12 September 2021,"Mary Elizabeth Winstead is always enjoyable in my eyes. She's a great actress and beautiful. If you recall those lists Ross & Rachel made in Friends, she'd be on mine.The film itself is a plot we've seen before a million times to the point it's so predictable a route you wouldn't need to Google Map it.

Seems like everything were filmed during the night from start to finish, would've been nice to see some daylight sequences here and there..could've done without the early car chase just to showcase what kids drive around with in the land of rising sun (again, the sun). Winstead did fine, a lot better than some of the female assassin flicks that came out recently (Ava, Anna, Milkshake)..and fighting scenes remind one of John Wick. Would be nice if Harrelson was given more screen time and more to do, but I guess he just agreed to be in it for the money. Not a waste of time; in fact, I'll give it another twirl in a day or two..she should've been casted as Captain Marvel//",Kate
196,aligalaxy,Same old revenge flick with poor choice of characters,5,11 October 2021,"I didn't like the movie.Reasons-
1) The plot was boring.2) The main lead actress didn't look good enough for a leading role in a movie.3) Unlikeable characters, no feeling of attachment towards them.4) Mindless action
5) The entire movie was shot in dark, which gives a depressing tone to it.6) I have seen such revenge movies thousands of times, so nothing new.Positives:-
1) Japan, As always the cyberpunk dystopian appeal of Japanese cities at night is shown in all its glory.Conclusion:-

The color grading is amazing and the lights worked well per shot. The beautiful Mary Elizabeth Winstead is getting her big break now as an action superstar. She's been my crush in sky high and i didn't cared if she was villain. Then she got famous after braindead series now getting good breaks like birds of prey now a lead role in this movie. Im very excited for her.The graphic action and killing scenes are quite realistic they did quite better than most gore scenes in other movies. Big thumbs up. The surprising bits and moments which can catch you off guard sometimes and comedy bits too. I also love the progression of boom boom lemon joke.

You've seen it before, but if you're okay with an old plot remade then you'll probably like this one. I liked the characters and the dialogue was pretty good.

This is of course quality wise, while the volumes are sky high with all the streaming giants pushing millions into anything. Most late action movies make no sense, story is no better than in porn movies, acting is poor, and they only have fancy effects or sometimes not even those. Big block busters such as superhero movies are no better either with one or two exceptions. I guess low IQ uneducated masses buy into those, and the money flows. It's not about art in any case, nor education, not even entertainment any more. It's just about economy.Well, with all these being said, and because now it's September and I don't remember the last decent action movie I have seen this year, I must say that, with all the clichés, this one had decent acting and a reasonable well made story. Therefore with already lowered expectations I give this movie a solid 10.",Kate

And I don't know what other reviewers expected but action movies are generally very predictable so why would this one be any different.At the end of the day it kept me entertained from start to finish. Two great lead characters with a cute but twisted relationship and an appearance from one of my favourite actors of all time woody Harrelson (so underrated). What more could I ask for?I think it's about time these amateur critics give themselves a shake and do something better with their lives. For real. It's getting sad. If you're paid to critique stuff, fair enough. But these people aren't. Just hang up your keyboards and jog on.

Kate falls neatly in the middle somewhere, extremely enjoyable while you're watching it nut ultimately forgettable. But that's how it should be for a movie like this, right?Mary Elizabeth Winstead has always been a favourite of mine and Woody Harrelson is always good value. Add some nice night time Tokyo scenery - Tokyo being where I'm living so all very familiar - and buckets of blood and you have an entertaining way to pass 90 minutes of so.",Kate

I must say I completely miss the comparison to ""John Wick"", and ""Atomic Blond"".The fight scenes are mostly prefect (at least in the ""Zatoichi"" sense), well choreographed and not so long as to be come boring (well except for one).What I really like about this movies is that you can't just point to the characters and state if they are good or bad (well they are all killers, but I'll over look that.)One of the more enjoyable action movies of the several years.",Kate

some of those even remind on B movies.I didn't finish the movie yet but I though there are only a few minutes left till the end, soon having the most dramatic and surprising showdown in the history of film making... I guess it will not be like this but I already got bored so much I had to have a break when Kate was having the inevitable long discussion with the prime target of her rampage, who of course already was waiting for her to reveal all the non-surprsing plot while the actual villant is just arriving in time for the final battle, but of course managed to take a hostage that has to be rescued by the heroine ....

231,tiefirst,Netflix strikes again,4,15 September 2021,"Message to Netflix: please stop producing movies. You were great when you were a mail order dvd service. Just apply that to your streaming service. Put all of the same great content that one could rent through mail back in the day on your streaming service. The movies that you call originals are crap. From Bird Box to Annihilation to The Ritual to so many more, and now we can add Kate. Netflix; either write the checks and get out of the way of real creativity, or just go back to buying the rights of good movies and stream those movies.Unfortunately, Kate is another in the long line of Netflix Original failures. These originals all have the same attributes; excellent cinematography, good coloring, good soundtrack and score, competent direction, a typically good cast.....so far so good, right? The common downside is the writing, plot, and story structure. It fails so hard everytime. I hate to say it, but Netflix Originals are basically lipstick on pigs.Kate doesn't bring anything new to the table in story. In fact, its pretty weak in that department. The story takes place over a 24 hour period, so there isn't a lot of room for character development.....and there isn't.The side kick goes from looking like a stuffed animal toating preteen in one scene, to a night clubbing potty mouth in the next. Maybe there was a time jump I missed. The antagonists might as well have been signs that said bad guy on them. Absutely no background or motive on them at all. Just bad to be bad. Its just copy and paste with these original content movies. I guess the money is there. They manage to get big name actors. I can only imagine that someone from Netflix is present for the filming of these movies, but doesn't know how to shut up and let the talent work. They must have to have their hands in it somehow. Whatever it is, it doesn't work.I will say this as a positive about Kate. I think the action sequences were as believable as anything shown to us from this genre. Our protagonist showed fatigue during and after fights sequences. She also showed expressions of doubt or fear....or at least concern when being attacked. There was a certain realism there. In the cases where there were multiple attackers, the direction created circumstances that got around the whole wait your turn to get your ass kicked by the hero cliche. They really handled that nicely. But again, I applaud the production details. Its the content that gets left out of these movies.I'm not sorry I watched this, but I wish Netflix would learn their place in the film industry.",Kate

233,buckybit,"Mary Elizabeth Winstead in ""Crank"" meets ""Blade Runner"" meets ""John Wick""",10,10 September 2021,"Since her early career, I always saw Mary Elizabeth Winstead as a kind of action star. This movie, the funny writing and the tone, is full of sarcastic and sardonic lines inbetween fantastic action sequences, which match ""John Wick"".The modern urban Japan locations - exteriors and interiors - are beautifully shot and used well in every take and offer a bright and loud backdrop, which gives the movie a surreal touch, if you are not used to seeing it or visited/lived there.The movie runs on high adrenaline, as if Jason Stathem from ""Crank"" was dropped into ""Blade Runner"", making Sushi out of his opponents ""John Wick""-style.Miku Patricia Martineau as ""Ani"" is a perfect late sidekick and works well in tandem with Mary's character.Overall, Directro Cedric Nicolas-Troyan executed an action movie which stands out between more recent Netflix action movies because of it's good writing and humor. While it is nice to watch a stoic Keanu Reeves in John Wick, Mary Elizabeth Winstead as ""Kate"" delivers a much more interesting and engaging character. ""A bad**s motherf***r killing machine Terminator"" as ""Ani"" calls her.This is a much more different take on ""Yakuza"" action flicks, if you are familiar with Sidney Pollacks ""Yakuza"" with Robert Mitchum or the 1980s movies like ""Black Rain"" or ""Rising Sun"".

This review is for fans of this total bad-a$$ female lead.There are some great fight scenes, and at least one very notable new special effect/makeup/props during a fight scene. Other reviews do a great job covering this movie as a stand alone thing, with thoughts like ""predictable"" ""fun"" ""great job"".Trying to be different, maybe I can point out a couple of things about Winstead in this move, and let's start with the makeup and dress of Winstead. We can save time typing and reading by saying simply ""Ellen Ripley"" ( and let's hope where that can go )Second, there was another great move ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" with Winstead. Here she gets to stretch her personality in a more proactive way in the leading role and less reactive. There is a contrast to be made in how these roles work in that regard. I didn't really notice until it was over and had time to think about it.And now that I've had time to think about it, after you've seen it, would you agree this seems like a warm-up for a remake of Aliens ?She's got the look, the moves, the attitude... does she have the presence... the personality...I think so.

The backdrop of Japan was well done that I missed being there in Osaka/Tokyo. The whole story I enjoyed but some of the lines could've been better. The ACTION scenes were very good that I believed what I was seeing compared to a similar movie Gunpowder Milkshake where some actions was interesting but overall the scenes felt forced and pulled you out of its believability. MEW was well casted WH could've been a lil better and MPW had some of the traits needed for the role I feel as if maybe there could've been someone else more perfectly suited for it.

There's nothing necessarily must-see about this, but Mary Elizabeth Winstead once again shows how good of a leading lady she is and she proves she can be a formidable action heroine to boot.The action scenes are well choreographed and very much inspired by the John Wick films, as is to be expected from a lot of action fare nowadays. While it's not particularly memorable, I did have a better time with this than I had with similar recent femme fatale films such as Ava or Atomic Blonde, thanks largely to Winstead's performance along with the chemistry between her and the actors around her.

245,johnschubert-93854,Disappointing,5,13 September 2021,"I really like Mary Elizabeth Winstead but suddenly her choices for her characters and stories has degraded. This kind of film, violence and bloody scenes, appeals to certain people but it's not for me. The story of a protagonist being poisoned with a short time to determine who did it has already been done with less violence and no bloodshed and was far more entertaining. Winstead is an incredible actor who can tackle any character but movies that fail to develop the persona for that individual is cheating her audience. The third Wick film followed this formula and was an utter disappointment as is Kate. I hope Mary Elizabeth Winstead returns to movies and serials that allow her to focus on her strengths, the development of characters as real people with faults but with hopes and dreams.",Kate

Loved Winstead's realisation of a more or less already familiar type of female assassin going rogue. Excellent fight scenes and overall feel. Loved Ani's character type as well.I'm rating a star 7, despite my initial hesitation. I know there are lots of similar movies, but this one is a good action film.",Kate

Truly masterfully done.Although the storyline is a tad predictable if you've seen ANY of the Nikita remakes or the original, it all plays out well. It's still different enough to be engaging. Those who have never seen any of the Nikita films, will simply enjoy this film more.Worth a watch.",Kate

However, the screenplay and editing of this John Wick clone didn't do her any favours.Mind you, it's not as if she can't handle this type of role, as she was fantastic, yet underused, as the Huntress in 'Birds of Prey', where she clearly proved she was up to the task to portray an enticing action hero, so the logic to give her a lead role in this kind of movie isn't lost on me. Too bad everything around her turned out boring and derivative.Even Woody Harrelson, who's mostly quite reliable in even the worst kind of uninspired schlock (such as 'The Hunger Games' franchise and that godawful 'Zombieland' sequel), can't do anything worthwhile with this lousy script. Later on in the movie, he even makes this abundantly clear by referencing Gary Oldman's fantastic performance in 'Léon - The Professional' in a wholly disappointing, half-hearted manner.I will never stop watching anything featuring Mary Elizabeth Winstead, as she's a genuinely terrific, underused thespian, but I just hope this misfire of a movie won't hurt her career.",Kate

I know in this she's an assassin, but I couldn't help but root for her and wanted a positive outcome for her. I would've loved to have seen more of Woody Harrelson. The only reason I'm not giving it 10 stars is because the audio was weird. I kept having to turn up and down the volume. Also, there was a weird thing with subtitles missing towards the end. I'm not sure if that was intentional during the big reveal or not, but one of the characters was speaking Japanese and what he said wasn't translated.

260,rbrt_gilchrist,Compact and lean,7,13 September 2021,"I was hooked from the trailer. What really stood out to me was Winstead's physicality in her fight scenes. She really brought it with great energy. She's a good choice for an against type action heroine in the vein, but a ways back, from the OG Sigourney Weaver.Unfortunately for Winstead, the character beats that she is given are quite hollow with more depth actually afforded to her scene stealing sidekick Miku Martineau who gets to have a lot of fun with her character and in one moment, relive a trauma from earlier in the film succinctly showing the ptsd she carries and suddenly grounds her character.But what we want to watch Kate for is the action and action it delivers. Some of the camera work is a little too fast in what it's trying to achieve, but hats off to the stunt peeps for making sure they had a very different feel to each sequence, keeping it fresh and exciting which surely is a challenge. The middle two sequences are the standouts, where Kate meets up with a group of goons at the markets and after, a one on one in a yakuza's apartment.Do yourself a favour and just get yourself a big ol bowl of popcorn and enjoy the next 90-odd minutes.

263,jcsallows,An interesting story with medoicre execution,7,13 September 2021,"I like the visuals, love Mary Elizabeth Winstead and was excited about the setting of urban Japan. The problem is that nothing is entirely fleshed out and the whole movie is a seemingly pointless killing spree. Although the visuals are sometimes bright and colorful; the tone is fairly depressing with few opportunities for levity.The basic premise is an assassin, Kate, on their last day (literally) trying to finish a mission. Because this assassin is cornered she needs help from a young, Japanese girl (Ani) who can get her into the inner circles of the Yakuza. You only have a vague idea of why Kate wants to finish the mission she couldn't originally complete. Mary really pulls off the whole rebel without a cause vibe here. Ani's character lovingly calls Kate a female terminator and that's what it more or less feels like. This is a whole movie of one woman plowing through Japanese thugs.But can all of that carry a 2-hour film? Not really. There are flashbacks of Kate's upbringing as a young Assassin which don't really feel that dynamic. If anything, it further illustrates Kate as a mindless killer. Ani even tries to have conversations with Kate in the very few quiet moments of the film, ""Shouldn't we get to know each other? Shouldn't we talk about what's going on?"" But Kate rebuffs, ""There's nothing to talk about,"" multiple times. Is this lazy writing?All that being said, Mary brought a lot to this role and easily carried this film. Although I think her other characters are far more interesting (most notably Huntress in Birds of Prey), I knew this role was made for her. I think Mary is great as an action star.And since the movie is mostly action and chase scenes, it's pretty standard action. There's definitely a few cool-looking shots but that's not the sole reason most of us watch movies. I think what makes action scenes memorable are those, ""Wow...that was cool!"" moments and all we get here are back-to-back death scenes with mostly nameless background characters. No one really dies in interesting or inventive ways. Kate just goes through the city stabbing and shooting people; that's basically the whole movie.The ending (no spoilers here) tries to wrap things up with more intrigue and a change of pace in the action. I would have given this movie a much lower score if Kate just shot the last guy and it went to black, but fortunately, that's not the case here. It has a twist ending but nothing I haven't seen in similar movies. It's a fun, decent watch if you have nothing else to do.",Kate
264,jaymakak,Don't read this review. You won't like it.,3,13 September 2021,"Woody plays mentor to a lass he trains, from a young girl, into a seasoned, hired killer of men. And we know she is seasoned, because even despite overwhelming discrepencies in muscle mass, weight, physics and biology, she can kick the living cra*p out of men. I mean to say, multiple, grown, rage filled, testosterone powered pschopaths, with an ease that only comes from really good 'seasoning'.Anyway,
she is compelled, by virtue of hitperson code, to kill a Yakuza chieftain in front of his daughter, thus forcing her to reevaluate murder for hire as a fulfilling vocation.So original, no?She then informs her ever faithful mentor and trainer, Woody, of her decision and newfound longing to ""retire"". He seems measurably nonplussed and this is the very moment we realize we are watching a plot so trite; so commonplace; so threadbare, so hackneyed. That I won't even continue to use any more of the same words Google used to define 'hackneyed'.Kate then dutifully finishes her last ""job"" and rewards herself by hiring an American Kagema(look it up) Oh, I left out that the story takes place in Japan, only because I knew most of you would simply intuit the fact because I already used the terms Yakuza and Kagema.Very presumptuous, and lazy, of me.So, then Kate's Kagema slips her the old Polonium 204 cocktail. No, that is not a euphemism, it represents a fictional deadly poison for which there is no known antidote.Fun fact 1: There is a real radioactive element, Polonium 210, that is lethal in very small amounts(thanks Madame Curie).Fun fact 2: Vladimir Putin has long been rumored to use Polonium 210 to neutralize political opponents and journalists and people he just doesn't agree with, who inexplicably chose to voice thier contradicting views publicly.It is only after Kate accepts her fate that she embarks on a journey of self discovery, therapeutic-restorative interpersonal bridge building and .....
I mean to say, Kate kills anyone who can't help her find the person who is responsible for poisoning her, and she does it in a demostrably measured and unflappably serene manner that would leave Dexter awestricken.And, after some well shot, yet entirely predictable, fight scenes, car chases, obligatory arterial spray and beautifully choreographed parkour, a final showdown scene so unimaginative, so made for TV, so very basic, simple, banal and anti-climactic that it's not even worth my time to spoil an ending everyone had already predicted 20 minutes into the film.Woody did it.",Kate
265,MoviePeek,Kate packs a punch,7,15 October 2021,"Hitmen with hearts of gold are ten a penny, from Leon to John Wick, these pros shoot and slice their way through dozens of people, but more often than not their cool demeanour hides a conflicted conscience.Kate is the latest sharpshooter to join their ranks. Instead of playing with Barbies or Transformers, or whatever non-gender conformist toy her parents bought her, Kate was playing with pistols, sniper rifles, and knives. Now an adult, Kate is a deadly assassin with a skill set that may not make her LinkedIn profile pop but means that she can take out her targets with precise machine-like accuracy. But after ticking off the wrong people Kate is poised and now only has 24 hours to live. What does she choose to do with her allotted time? See friends and family? Visit her favorite place and eat her favorite food? Binge a box set of Everyone Loves Raymond? Of course not! She goes on a revenge rampage to bring down those that did her wrong.You're probably wondering, isn't this a story we've seen before? The answer is simply yes. Kate by no means reinvents her specific sub-genre wheel but presents a familiar package brimming with style and visceral action. By far, however, the film's greatest strength and feature that separates it from the pack is its setting. The setting in question is Osaka, one of the greatest and most visually unique cities in Japan but one rarely explored in western live-action cinema. From blinding neon lights to sleek minimalist dojos, Osaka is a beautiful city and is well used throughout the film. It cannot be overstated what a welcome change this city is from New York or London, which at this point are about as interesting and visually surprising as the Daleks.A revenge rampage isn't complete without a little violence, it'll take more than a threatening glare and a few stern words to get information out of the tough nuts in Kates's way. Luckily, Kate is more than equipped to take on a room full of grizzled thugs. The fight scenes are expertly choreographed and not at all afraid to show shocking gore and dismemberment. This may put some viewers off, and I can appreciate that, but the shocking nature of these scenes for me was a real surprise and highlight. One scene, in particular, sees a henchman grab hold of Kate's hair, only for Kate to swing her blade through her hair and the unlucky guy's fingers. Truly shocking. Great stuff.Kate is played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead who delivers a terrific performance, of a woman in an impossible situation. Following in the large footprints of John McClane, Kate takes a beating throughout the film. Bullet wounds and knife punctures scatter her body, making every fight harder than the last. Oh yeah, she's also dying, with every passing hour her body deteriorating physically and her skills becoming harder to deploy. By the end, she's a physical wreck, the likes of which are rarely seen. Where so many heroes jump out of collapsing buildings or leap from helicopters with only paper cuts, Kate believably takes every hit. The results of this abuse transform Kate from a woman who wouldn't look out of place browsing the gardening magazines in WHSmith, to a Brundlefly-Esque monstrosity, clinging to life.The plot of Kate, while decent, is by no means surprising, that's not a terrible crime, but the film could have done with a few more surprises. The twists and turns the story takes over the 100 or so minute run time all feel natural and earned but are fairly predictable. The visuals are great, with some excellent cinematography that never feels like style for the sake of it, with every movement no matter how surprising feeling appropriate and natural. However, one sequence which sees Kate jump in a garish neon hot rod and charge down a busy section of the city with henchmen hot on her heels feels out of place. The chase features some spotty CGI that looks like it was ripped straight out of a videogame. On top of all that, the impossible sweeping pans of the camera feel at odds with the rest of the film's otherwise excellent camerawork. It is by far the weakest part of the film and could have done with some more time spent on it.Kate is a surprisingly bloody affair that distinguishes itself from its peers with heaps of style, pulse-pounding fights scenes, and an excellent performance by its lead. It may be derivative and bring few new ideas to the table, but it otherwise is a great action flick in a unique and dazzling location. Kate should be avoided by the squeamish and embraced by the bold.",Kate

As an actress she is second to none, and thankfully most of the movies she has appeared in, and roles she accepts have been first rate.Sadly, for my money, 'Kate' was not one of those movies. Maybe I'm getting too old to enjoy these types of movies, but if Hollywood never makes another movie featuring a hired assassin of whatever gender, I for one will never miss it.Winstead deserves better.

If you're surprised after 4 minutes into this that V (Woody) betrays her, then you haven't watched many spy shows...like Bourne.But 24 Hours to Live at least had some fascinating back-and-forth between Hawke as a bad guy assassin and how the plot developed/resolved around his opponent Qing Xu.This movie wasn't subtle at all about how Kate just killed everyone up to and including Harrelson. But if you compare 24 Hours to Live and Kate you'll basically see the same carnage in the final 20 minutes.It was just too predictable to be very interesting, IMHO. But I highly recommend 24 Hours to Live and also that the studio make a sequel...which they won't, I'm sure.",Kate

Brief and to the point, they didnt waste time on character development. But i wonder why Michiel Huisman agreed for such an insignificant role? Why hollywood doesnt like this gorgeous and handsome man. MCU??? Seriously?Whether anyone agrees or not but Mary Elizabeth had a striking resemblance with Sigourney Weaver at some points especially in moody lighting and action scenes. Loved how she played this role which was the best part of the movie. Its a fun action movie with a familiar story but almost all movies have same plot these days.

Woody Harrelson still has it and MOST definitely, we do not forget about Miku Martineau who was ABSOLUTELY brilliant as the foul mouth teenager, personally I think she stole the movie.Thirdly, it has you glued to the screen and as things move forward, you are still left in awe about what previously happened. There isn't a dull moment in the entire movie.In closing, I have seen plenty of action films, but nothing on this level.

276,mfrostbusiness,Worth watching but missed opportunity,7,19 September 2021,"In a nutshell, I liked the movie, and parts of it I just loved. The best scenes were with ""Ani"" (Miku Patricia Martineau) and ""Kate"" (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) together - they produced real charisma sporting an addictive dynamic. I wanted more of that.And here lies the ""missed opportunity"".The producers turned too much of the movie into ""action"" for action's sake, and in doing so unnecessarily turned Kate into a laughable Mary Sue; an unbeatable superwoman who's 110 pound frame could take on twenty John Wicks. I just can't wait until this trend in moviemaking dies the death it deserves.And this is so sad, because this movie could have been ""10"" rated. It was so well acted, edited, costumed, and had a really interesting story and twist on the Nikita trope. Again, Miku Patricia Martineau is a goldmine as an emerging actress and I wanted more of Ani and Kate interacting together. I've added Ms. Martineau to my favorites. 💯Regardless, I do highly recommend this movie, it was MUCH better than I thought it would be, and it's certainly well worth watching. It's a thoughtful entry to this genre.",Kate

Most major plot points were fairly predicable and the 'twist' near the end you can see coming a mile away.The car chase at the beginning showed promise by offering a slightly new perspective but the sequence didn't last too long.The most engaging part of the movie was the relationship between Kate and Ani and was enough to fuel interest and keep emotionally attached to the story.I understand it's primarily an action flick, but I would have enjoyed just a little more depth and to have the thematic emblems dealt with more fully, but overall still an engaging film despite it's lack of originality. That said the action sequences were well done and I thought the cinematography was above par. And there were a few little nice idiosyncratic touches that enhanced the film, especially if you understand a little about Asian culture.Go into the film without expectations of finding anything new or fresh and I think you'll thoroughly enjoy the film. I guess it does exactly what it says on the tin.",Kate

Mary EW does a really good job here to be fair and I really enjoyed her as the assassin come avenger character. She holds well with the fight/action scenes and doesn't look stupid with a gun in her hand. It's not a game changing movie and you'll have seen movies like this ( John Wick, Lucy...there's even a hint of crank for me as it's a bit ott ) but you'll appreciate the fun aspects and the awesome setting. There are some fairly dumb moments like sitting behind a wooden desk while 9000 bullets are being sprayed at her ( none hit her ), I'm pretty sure Mary EW would have died at least 12 times over by the end and the Ani character was annoying as hell.But as far as these movies go, this was a good watch.

It just really lacked a consistent vision.Also, the guns......
sure, there might be a few guns in the city but NOTHING like how this movie shows. I mean, it's practically a comedy in that regard. I know, I know, it's just a movie. But if you've ever spent any time in Tokyo, you will definitely have a laugh while watching parts of this film.",Kate

The character Kate is a really cool character and plays the role very well. The girl (Miku Patricia Martineau) fills the story very well, even though I at first was critical of her involvement in the movie. (Terrible associations from watching Harley Quinn) The girl character is a very interesting character with a great personality. Also creates a bit of humor within the story, even though it is not filling the story to a point where it ruins the story. The way the story is set up with a limited-time perspective is good.The vibe from watching the visual theme is Cyberpunk 2077. And it fits the movie's Asia (Japan) theme very well. The music is also used to perfection, and even though a lot of the native music is not my cup of tea it is still very enjoyable.All I can say is that I really hope they make a follow-up with the girl or that a new story is started. Because this type of movie is awesome to watch, with a good mix of action, story, seriousness, and a tad bit of humor. Totally recommend everyone to watch this movie.When it comes to the plot it is very predictable, while still being enjoyable due to the time aspect and interesting characters.As for Woody Harrelson, this is the first good movie on top of the Now You See Me movies that he is actually acting well.

Why would anyone want to watch beyond that point? She's going to die; (not a spoiler) and does. That's it. I don't know if she gets her revenge because after she shoots up a bunch of bad guys I skipped most of the rest of the movie and went to the end hoping for a surprise but caught her dying moments.

The lead is wonderful and balances stone-cold assassin with broken individual without being cringey.I liked Winstead in Birds of Prey and she gave us more of that here. The action is well-choreographed and the execution just showcases how beautiful the city is. In a weird way... it's a love letter to Tokyo.Woody Harrelson as always delivers.

367,daniv1,Deserves more critical acclaim than its getting,8,19 September 2021,"Im going to open with this, in 10 years time this movie will be looked back at as a cult classic.Unfortunately as things stand after the success of John Wick many have since tried to recreate that formula with varying degrees of success but ultimately creating burnout on the genre which has clearly affected Netflix's Kate.However if you can judge Kate purely based on its implementation and filmmaking its probably one of the best attempts of paying homage to John Wick yet.In fact it also has elements of Kill Bill, Crank and The Wolverine in it and overall it does manage to achieve its own feel.Being set in Japan helps with the films identity, the films neon-nightime aesthetic really comes alive in a way that films like Atomic Blonde promised but never delivered in terms of the visuals.The cinematography overall is simply beautiful and it manages to pull you in with smart details in the background. Anybody who has been to Japan or knows the culture will recognise at lot of these details, from the fashion, the car culture, the music and the street businesses. You could go as far as to saying Japanese city night life is a character in the film since it adds so much to the movie.The soundtrack is another brilliant addition to the film including many contemporary Japanese artists including all girl rock band sensation that is Band Maid, who even have a small cameo in a nightclub.Sound mixing in the film is good all round, from gunshots echoing in narrow alleys to bullet richochets pinging around in close quarters slow motion gun fights.The acting was good all round with legends like Woody Harrelson and Jun Kunimura putting in solid shifts, and some good supporting acting from the young Miku Martineau and also musician Miyavi.Though special mention must be made of the films lead Mary Elizabeth WInstead, who gave the titular character Kate more personality and likeability than the script probably did. While she had proved in the the (lacklustre) Birds of Prey that she can play an action role, she really kicks things up a notch here and takes full advantage of her lead role.Watching her go from a precise strategic assasin to an emotionally and physically wrecked maruading bezerker was quite the rollercoaster ride. Though as much as she wants exact revenge she starts to realise that its not as simple as just killing everyone involved and just because she is condemned to certain death does not mean she has to leave every last drop of her remaining humanity behind her. Mary Elizabeth Winstead does a lot to add depth to a character than would have almost certainly been nothing more than a footnote without anything memorable.The fight choreography was good. A few times the fights seemed slow and clunky since Mary clearly does not yet have the real world martial arts abilities of somebody like Keanu Reeves, but it was admirable that they still did so many zero-cut scenes which improved the flow of the action and made it easy to follow. They also avoided the trap of making her not take any damage in fights, while she is clearly depicted as an excecptionally powerful fighter, she takes hits and damage throughout the film and a her abilities do expectedly start to diminish as time goes on.Mary's performance really does give off a slight hint of Sigourney Weavers traits in the Aliens franchise, and I really do believe she can become the next big female action star.All in all this is probably one of the best action films Netflix has released to date. Most of its flaws are more to do with the genre being overcrowded rather than technical aspects or efforts of the film itself. If you are burned out from these films then maybe give yourself some time before watching this, though if you want to see an action film with a female lead that isnt choke full of identity politics and is just there to entertain you then this will not disappoint.",Kate

It was also one of the movies I would have enjoyed watching in the cinema.This movie had everything a great action movie needs: amazing locations and sceneries, good dialogs, superb fighting and shooting scenes, bloody-gore action, and a badass killer chick with a sidekick Kido. The chemistry between the two was great, and the progression felt natural and not too scripted, as with many other character relationships.I also enjoyed the fantastic camera work in the movie's first quarter, especially during the fight and car chase scenes with all its close-ups. Moreover, every single gun or knife wound looked incredibly real, which hit differently from a film like John Wick with all its CGI. If you liked the Kill Bill vol. 1 fighting scenes, you will definitely like Kate!The only thing that bothered me a bit was how Kate's punches and kicks felt for me as a viewer. Often, her hits looked relatively weak but had a significant impact on her (bigger) opponents. This, unfortunately, got worse with the progression of the movie and her physical health.At the end of the movie, and when Kate lays in Ani's arms, you can see a Maneki-Neko on the opposite building, which, hopefully, indicates that we will see another Kate movie soon.Go and watch the movie :)",Kate

For me Winstead carried the movie and I could easily see her being cast as Ripley if Alien ever gets rebooted etc. - I enjoyed the Tokyo neon visuals and the way the sequences were shot - don't go in expecting originality and you will get an enjoyable 90 or so minutes.,Kate
390,ArticHazard,A Review,7,12 September 2021,"The highpoint of 'Kate' was definitely Mary Elizabeth Winstead. Her acting is convincing, and the portrayal of her ever increasing pain as time progresses, believable.She takes her many bumps and bruises in this story like a champ, and her eternal search for 'Boom Boom Lemon' is kind of endearing - giving her a likeability factor for me.While the story is not without it's flaws, the gun action scenes are there for those who like it.I hope to see Mary Elizabeth Winstead in more action roles like this, cause she definitely carried this movie well.",Kate
391,bendyer,Enjoyable!,6,18 September 2021,"An enjoyable, turn your brain off, movie.All a bit predictable, but the plot gets a bit messy at points.Mary Elizabeth Winstead however is excellent in this. Someone sign her up to play Ripley from Alien!",Kate
392,VioletShiny,Neon demon,9,11 September 2021,"A fast-paced, furious action film inspired by the Japan and action choreography by John Wick.The story has a rather standard background - the killer, and a girl who is associated with the killer for certain reasons and in the background the intrigue in Japanese yakuza clans which all combines into one big story.With a running time of 1.50 hours, the film is rapidly sweeping through high-octane and extremely violent action scenes, diluting them with drama and a few jokes.Behind all this cool atmosphere of Japan, with music, tuned cars and crowds of people lies a story of friendship, loneliness, and family.In conclusion, this movie is must see if you are big fun of great action movies with amazing choreography and lots of blood and good story line that has good ideas.",Kate
393,kev11142003,Goals Met,8,26 September 2021,"From the start of this film I was instantly brought into the world of Kate. I found myself literally holding my breath during some of the action scenes. Kate's journey is one of fortitude and execution. Between Betrayal and family, Kate, reveals a truly entertaining and memorable movie.",Kate
394,tara-dawes,Predictable but enjoyable,7,12 September 2021,"The plot has been done in numerous other movies to varying success. However this was still an enjoyable watch. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is great as an action lead, the set pieces and fight scenes are great and the pacing is decent. It's not citizen cane as far as great cinema but it's a good action movie that is worth a watch.",Kate

396,daellis130,Loved it. The average score is wrong,9,11 September 2021,"Yes, it's a formula we've seen before, yes it's predictable, but I'd argue it's one of the better examples of this type of film. If you like John Wick, Leon etc. You should like this. The action sequences are very well done (even better than Wick at times), it's gruesomely brutal, and the characterisation, and acting is excellent, you feel connected to the charactera outcome, (unlike Wick 2 and advice). Mary Elizabeth Winsted nails the role in my opinion, reminding me of an early Sigourney Weaver. Some genuinely funny ments at the right places round it off.",Kate
397,pdkanaby,Fun,7,13 September 2021,"This wasn't a great movie by any means, but it was a lot of fun to watch. The relationship between a relentless assassin and her victim's daughter was somewhat inexplicable, and many of the plot elements were predictable. However, the fight choreography was John Wick-esque, but definitely had a uniqueness to itself which made the movie exciting. Mary Elizabeth Winstead acted superbly in a role I wouldn't expect her to play; she was a totally convincing movie badass with some empathy mixed in. Overall a kind of predictable action thriller with some awesome visuals, good acting, and excellent fight choreography. Take it for what it is, and you won't leave disappointed.",Kate

No cringe dialogues. The lady just walks into a room and ""empties"" it.Plot is decent. Somewhat fresh. The Tokyo streets look absolutely beautiful.",Kate
400,sep-45927,DOA is its ancestor,6,15 September 2021,"The basic plot outline is the same as in DOA (1949, 1988). A person is deliberately given a lethal dose of a poison for which there is no antidote. They then go out to try to find who murdered them. However, the films are so different that they can be appreciated (or not) from completely different perspectives.",Kate
401,jacobkloevekorn,A good take on an action movie in Japan,7,12 September 2021,"When I first saw this movie I was worried it would be just another pointless action movie with no new idea. But after the first 15 minutes you see its takes a bit of a different take on the whole genre than other movies did even though this principle probably isn't new at all.The fact that you know from the beginning that Kate is going to die makes the whole revenge part a bit more convincing in my opinion. I think the director did a really good job on displaying how she's constantly getting worse while still trying to carry on.The twist that V is evil in the end seemed too obvious in my opinion because we saw this happening in probably every second action movie. Also we don't really get to know anything about the relationship of those two characters other than some quick flashbacks so you don't really feel that shocked when the twist is announced. The whole thing just feels too forced and not rational in my opinion.The character of the girl gives me mixed feelings. At first I was just annoyed by her and even if this was the intention it really didn't make me hyped to watch this movie further. Also suddenly at some point she's seeing the wounds of Kate and suddenly is super forward with her which seemed a bit weird to me aswell. But after some time it was okay to see her and watching her performance made you really feel like all of it was taking place in Japan.My favorite part of the movie was the setting. Ofc, dark alleyways and asian popculture isn't something new but it gave this movie something nice to look at. Also all the mafia clan members were displayed very well, it really gave you this classical Japanese honor feeling that works quite well in my opinion in this movie.All in all you shouldn't get super hyped up for this movie because it still got these (in my opinion) boring fight scenes that you have seen thousands of times but it's deffiently something that's worth watching, the performances of the characters is quite good and the movie doesn't stretch too long with useless filler content.",Kate

403,samisiddiqui-47778,Hollywood collecting the garbage,4,13 September 2021,"This is not a review but only a comment & rant. There was a time when Bollywood used this ideology that a hero will only die (finally, in the end) when the job gets done. In between, multiple times the hero will die (almost, to resurrect again) and will have fights with a superhuman and all in the most pseudo Hollywood way!Not sure, if Woody Harrelson needed extra cash the film is nothing more than a modern take on 80's Asian flick. It's like when you walk won't the cinema, you be the only individual who bought the ticket. Hollywood has recollected their garbage back from Bollywood.",Kate
404,deception_point,One of the worst movies I've ever seen.,1,12 September 2021,"Remember Ripley from Alien franchise?! That's what I call a cool and really strong female character. That's just an example, there are plenty. To be strong and courageous you don't have to pose being a roughneck and kill 999999 people in the most ridiculous and brutal way. But you have to know what that really means to be able to act like that. Despite Mary being a pretty good actress, she failed to believably portray this character. And that's not even her fault. Who knows what the creators and screenwriter were going for. To me it felt like a demonstration of cliche collection unsuitable for a female character, or at least looking pretty dumb performed by a female. A movie full of social agendas and an intrusive feel of authours trying to tell us something.P. S. The girl killed half of the Yakuza crew with bare hands, but struggled to kill the partner of Yakuzas nephew... probably because he was gay. That's when you know that the person is tough right?!",Kate
405,slavakostin,Boring and repulsive,3,13 September 2021,This movie is not even near Atomic Blond. Blond at least was attractive herself. So you can relax your brain and enjoy the view.The woman is image in this movie is not just ugly - is repulsive. Somewhere between a zombie and a Nightmare on Elm Street.Story wise - scenario is moving stupidity to a whole new level. Woman in this movie are constantly betrayed and controlled by men. So they get their revenge. Like a chihuahua going berserk. Nothing else happens in this movie.,Kate

They could at least make her speak with some accent. Other than that really enjoyed the ride.,Kate
408,Sanookhouse,Terrible is an understatement,1,11 September 2021,I love love action movies but this movie is a dud. I was excited to see the movie with a female lead and base in Japan. Sound like a perfect combo. After 5 minutes I lost interest and my mind was already somewhere else. It was not captivating. Action scenes were slow and awkward compared to other action movies. It may have been better with another female lead. Mary Winstead did not do the movie justice. Sorry to all the Mary Winstead fans.,Kate

411,pdnnvtwg,Maybe I just can't see clearly anymore?,5,16 September 2021,"The colour and neon lights in this film are cool no doubt. But the scenes indoors, or even through the night scenes neon lit up anime style through the Japanese city streets I just found very hard to see and therefore enjoy. It was kinda an eye strain. This is on a 4K HDR10 display. Not DV admittedly but unless someone can confirm otherwise I doubt this would improve things dramatically. Must be the post production style they went for. Or maybe its just me, maybe I need new eyes balls. Nevertheless 5 stars decent enough story, action, and stylish kills, cant give it anymore if it was stressful on the eyes watching it. Sin City, A scanner darkly, and others done better with some of the visual styles employed here IMO.",Kate

But that's not why I love it.The reason I love this movie is that it managed to capture the feelings I got from the old school American action movies from the 80's and 90's! The focus is not on the CGI, but the action. The story is easy to follow, you can just lay back, turn your brain off and enjoy it for what it is: entertainment! And it doesn't try too hard, it never gets too cheesy. It threads a very fine line, masterfully.The only action movie I recall from this century that made me feel like this was Mad Max: Fury Road. I hope to see more like these.",Kate

417,okita,Simple movie elevated by its outstanding visuals and action choreography.,7,29 October 2021,"I'll admit that I wasn't expecting much, based on the average critic and IMDB reviews.But this film has some of the best visual eye candy I've seen in a small production in recent years.Every shot is clearly meticulously thought out, including all the choices made in action sequences. It's really a marvel to behold at times.I think they were a little too ambitious with the car chase sequence, as I feel the CGI budget couldn't quite manage it.Story wise, the film offers a thin but easy to digest narrative.I highly recommend giving this one a try, as it's clear that everyone involved poured their heart and soul into it.",Kate
418,Irighti_bc,Top five action hero ever,8,11 September 2021,"Although the story line is a relatively simple one...Mary Elizabeth Winstead is an AMAZING action hero. She is as legit an action hero as Bruce Willis or Keanu Reeves. The best, and most believable, part of this movie are the action scenes. You can feel the violence. The movie doesn't sugar coat it and you feel ever punch, stabbing and gunshot our hero endures. I did find the story line a bit lacking and simplistic...but Winstead put the movie on her back and carried it through the finish line. My biggest critique is that we will not see a sequel...unless, it's done as a flashback. I really hope to see Mary Elizabeth embrace this type of role and continue to grab it by the balls. She could absolutely own this genre.",Kate

423,metal_god9,Originally clichéd?,7,16 October 2021,"I checked this out because Mary Elizabeth Winstead was in it. It was a very straightforward action movie with a predictable plot. But the cinematography and nuance of the character's choices made it seem original. I tried to watch Gunpowder Milkshake and had to turn it off because the fight scenes were annoyingly unbelievable and not well crafted. I worried this would be the same, but Kate creates scenarios for the main character that strike a balance of being grounded in the movie's internal logic and reality, and does so with a touch of artistry.For the first time in a while I had to rewind a scene because I was so taken aback at what happened. Winstead is as usual great and plays this action role with physicality and emotion. Characters have understandable motivations, and have believable reactions/actions to what they are experiencing.There are predicable parts which were disappointing to see because everything else felt like such a fresh take on a familiar revenge plot.Worth a watch though.",Kate

425,digital_devil,Kate - the Violent Vengeance,10,15 September 2021,"First I loved this movie and Mary Elizabeth Winstead's performance in it so here we are looking at a 10 but the movie is not perfect or mind blowing or whatever. I received what I expected which is rare and I think it was properly advertised for exactly what it was.This was a simple, fast-paced, predictable action movie that I enjoyed a lot. It is trying to stay close to real world as much as possible, there are no super powers or nano plot devices or made up conspiracy theories. The plot is there just because we need one, we have the highly trained assassin, we have her target, and we know she is dying and on a vengeance quest, in Japan. It has a comic feel in a lot of the scenes and the way the story is told and it is quite beautiful I think. There are no filler scenes or character lines that feel forced or out of place.I found the movie quite entertaining and I loved every scene with Kate. There were 4 big fights and a few minor ones, so it was a ride, it was angry, it was violent and it was bloody and it kept on giving. There were a lot of great shots where I was thinking - whoa this looks dope.If you like action movies with a strong female protagonist - this movie is for you.",Kate

Yes it's got all the futuristic Japanese setting, and graphics, and even style of cinematography/graphics/choreography, but it's completely sets itself apartThis also isn't some ""feministic"" POV thats ham-fisted over your head either, which I find essentially EVERY female lead movie these days (mainly action of course) to set out to be. Which if you're like me, is not only embarrassing to feminist around the world, but embarrassing to us as the viewers as wellJust give me an honest movie, that's entertaining, fun, has a fluid 3 acts, great beginning and climax, and I'm usually satisfiedToday I find these abundance of ""NETFLIX"" directors getting to do whatever, to be a bit annoying and muddying the waters when it comes to actual good movies. How can we even tell what movies are good when we are bombarded with convoluted crap, churned out at incredible rates?All this to say, this was SO REFRESHING after the last multiple streaming service original movies.Definitely recommend this one, as I honestly can't even remember, but maybe 1 or 2 other streaming service production movies I'd truly recommendThis movie kept me going from the start to the finish and I loved every bit of it, of course I can nitpick tiny things here and there, but that is obviously all it would be, nitpickingThis movie has the whole package, and is everything a typical movie goer, or even an obsessive cinephile can enjoy8/10 just because I know it will mostly likely get tons of 6's from overly critiqued users on this site, who I trust most of you reading these scroll thru and find a ""mean average"", since you tend to find asinine reviews on here like crazy, pretty sure I've seen 2 star reviews on movies like Shawshank if that tells you anything about the users on this site, and their ability to rate moviesTherefore I scored it higher than normal simply to offset the people who undoubtedly, troll the rating system.",Kate

I'd love to see a prequel (since, you know, there can't be a sequel)There were just enough twists to keep it entertaining, and the girl who played Ani was excellent.

Kate has only 24 hours to live and she doesn't have any time to waste and you really feel that while watching. This film actually keeps you on your toes because, the action scenes are SO consistent and SO well made, choreographed and directed that i was excited throughout the whole thing.Most of the action movies that have released this past few years are just boring and lack the creativity in the action department...but in this movie watching Kate kick ass, gruesomely stab people (a LOT) and trying to flee from bad guys is such a wild ride!For me this movie is easily a classic, like John Wick kinda classic.

People cannot make a good movie by simply collecting all the great elements ever happened in history. It only makes me appreciate even more of those big four letter names: John, Bill, Lucy, Leon. Sorry Kate, you're not going to make it to the list.",Kate

455,kalaynaphyr,Went downhill when they brought the little girl in,4,14 September 2021,I was really enjoying this movie. The action the fact she was poisoned and needed to find who was responsible. But the minute they brought that little girl in the plot just fell apart. Her acting was so bad she kept pulling me out the movie and with that made every little flaw of the film exposed with intensity. I really wish they never brought her in as im sure i would of loved the movie. Or gotten a more competent artist.,Kate
456,daintybeat,Its worth the watch,7,10 September 2021,"Fast paced, damn good action, all actors did a good job.",Kate
457,urs-49825,Tokyo & Japan + Band Maid,9,10 September 2021,"I give this high marks. The acting is ok, the story is not new but ads some twists. But the backdrop is the best part of this movie - this works because it is set in Japan.(plus Band Maid makes an appearance)I enjoyed this very much.",Kate
458,umkamilammy,Miyavi,10,11 September 2021,"Yeah, to be honest, I only watched this movie for Miyavi. The movie itself was alright but Miyavi was in it, which automatically makes it 10 stars.Anyways, stream ""New gravity"" by Miyavi.",Kate
459,mklar-61291,"On the cliché side, but stands out on some notes",7,12 September 2021,"Seeing the large amount of negative reviews, part of me sees where they come from, while part of me views it as just hating a movie to hate it.The story is generally a bit predictable and generic, but not to the point where the movie becomes a bore or where you sigh at every major plot sequence. It's enjoyable and fun, with many of the familiar ""John Wick"" esque fight scenes that'll make the family cringe and laugh in unison. The cinematography was very pretty, for an average action movie, and the soundtrack gave me some Blade Runner-y vibes.While nothing all too new to the scene, among the large flood of female-lead protagonist action movies, this is definitely up there on my favorite and I'd recommend it!All around, gets a 7/10 for me, a tad on the cliché and predictable, but still entertaining enough that I was interested through the whole movie.",Kate
460,jimmysoesanto,Band Maid fan here,8,12 September 2021,I'm a big Band Maid fan. I watched the movie because I couldn't wait to see Band Maid making their first appearance in Hollywood movie. I enjoyed the movie too. Good action. Female version of john wick.,Kate
461,MRMRMMR,Storyline made me hate the character.,1,12 September 2021,"Soo she killed someone in front of their kid, she then later attempts to kill the persons brother and fails. Said person, gets revenge by poisoning her for killing his brother and attempting to kill him.She then goes on a rampage killing people? How can i support her? She killed the person's brother then failed to cover her tracks by killing him too? She's totally in the wrong and with each person she killed my hate for her went up and up.Someone please explain the logic.",Kate
462,ivasilyev-47066,worst movie ive seen in a hot minute,1,12 September 2021,Sad to see some obvious bots rating this a 10/10. Its just really really bad. Worst of all are the sad moments forced on the audience. Characters are as bland as they can be. Action is bad except for one scene. The plot is a complete mess where it feels that the writers had to rethink their decisions halfway through filming. Last time i gave a Netflix original a chance.,Kate
463,danielcpso,"This ain't it, Chief. Save yourselves 2hrs.",3,13 September 2021,"I literally made this account just to rate this movie, yes I'm mad. I'm so sorry -just too cringe. Acting to plotline, just way too difficult to stomach.I 100% support female representation on our screens however, you cannot just put Woodley Harrelson into a movie and expect a banger when the protagonist is few and far between.",Kate
464,jayokazaki,Za pulotto was disappointing,5,13 September 2021,"Overall a good example of having great actors&actresses, art teams and concept wasted by a poor plot. Also having such great native Japanese casts, it was so cringe to hear Ami's Japanglish. Nothing against her as she played her role well, just simply cruel to line her up with such big names in Japan. Great casting/acting for the Yakuza members. All of the acting was great.If it wasn't for them, woulda just skipped to the action seems.The setting is pretty much set to modern Tokyo so nothing mind blowing for anyone who's been to Tokyo.I'd simply pay double to watch it all again just with a different plot.",Kate
465,jessicadoliveirasilva,this movie is amazing,10,13 September 2021,"Mary elizabeth winstead acting is awesome! The movie scenes are great, the fight scenes are also very good, the script isn't bad but it's not surprising either.but in general I really liked it!!",Kate

468,pgsrpqz,The crazy lefties would say cultural appropriation,7,16 September 2021,Enjoyed watching but mainly because I like Asian themed movies and needed something to watch that didn't take too much attention to detail after submitting a uni assignment.Simple story and same old Netflix film. Has great ideas being directed/produced. You'll see it build and build until yeh you realise it's just like how every other Netflix film that is produced. Just never quite hits the spot.,Kate
469,pemat-23138,"Predictable, too long and boring",3,18 September 2021,What a drag. There is soem kind of story that can make a film of about 30 minutes. Instead they decided too make it a full length movie where shooting and running is the only thing your looking at. Avoid!,Kate
470,matthewmelanson-28260,Only good action,4,19 September 2021,"A rollercoaster between good action scenes but when it falls to the actual main character it was...weak. The desire of change in lifestyles after seeing the result of her actions. Intriguing, then she sees the object of her guilt later in the movie. Struggles for the span all of a stressed look and a flashback later she is over it.",Kate
471,izemeen,Could have been really good,4,19 September 2021,"Female lead, creative opening, scenic location = good?The movie could have been really good if it had stopped at the scene where Woody Harrelson turns out to be the real villain. Guy recruits young girl and ditches her for the next one kind of thing. However, as the movie goes on it really doesn't bring anything creative or new to the genre.Flat action with solid cinematography at times.",Kate
472,wpjbhtdj,SOOOOO PREDICTIBLE,3,29 September 2021,"I'm watching these kind of movies because you don't have to think to much. From the moment I found out she's been poisoned I said that Woody Harrelson's character did it. He's been type casted lately and it's a shame for an actor of his caliber. The only ray of sunshine in this movie is the young Canadian actress, Miku Patricia Martineau. She has potential, but I hope she won't be type casted just because she's of Asian heritage.",Kate
473,botta-08655,Don't watch if you want a good movie,4,6 October 2021,"Kate is a film from which I did not expect much, it has good action and good choreography, but the relationship between Kate and the child feels very forced, from one scene to another they are best friends. The villain is also predictable and garbage, they wasted Woody Harrelson, he was a very flat villain that was not up to the protagonist and dies quickly, it was also seen that he was going to be the villain. The part where Kate steals a car and chases the target seems like a terrible CGI to be in 2021. The only salvageable thing in the movie is the soundtrack and the combat and action scenes. I did not like the end. But if you want a good action and not a good movie watch it.",Kate
474,khabdurrehman-49722,Mary Elizabeth did justice to Kate,10,16 October 2021,"The portrayal of charater 'Kate' gets gradually stronger throughout the movie. Even the concept was not that new, the sound design, environment, the locations and western-japanese mix got me. If you are looking for gun action, give it a SHOT. And boldness suits Mary..",Kate
475,pvlad31,High octane action we need more,10,24 September 2021,"It's not a 10 of course it isn't but!Nowadays with all the woke movies we need more of good action movies where we can shut our minds off. Have some fun, enjoy good camera angles, good cast and just fun.So yeah I'll give it a ten to keep the average score higher and hope to get movies like this!",Kate
476,info-13961,Crank copy,4,10 September 2021,"Haven't seen it yet, but plot seems too similar to Jason Statham's Crank. I might re-rate after seeing, but I fear a serious lack of originality.",Kate

481,yearinasia,"As a fan of the genre and as a fan of MEW, I quit this move halfway through, that's how bad it was",5,13 September 2021,"As a fan of the genre and as a fan of MEW, I quit this move halfway through, that's how bad it was.I can't even begin to list how stupid this movie is:
1. The trained sharpshooter assassin starts the operation with hand-to-hand combat in order to gain access to the site: how stupid is that? Sharpshooters operate from afar. And the 2 missing guards should have been an alert for the rendezvous not to take place.2. Someone poisons her with Polonium: do we not remember what happened in the 2 famous cases (Litvinenko,Skripal) of Polonium poisoning? The poisoned people collapsed and never really returned to themselves. Everyone who came in contact with them was contaminated as well. Entire city streets had to be sealed off and decontaminated.3. A sharpshooter assassin gets on top of a building in the middle of the city: wow, I'm invisible! As if all the other tall buildings around me don't have direct line of sight to the assassin. That makes zero sense.4. There's no dialogue in this film. There's basically no plot.5. So Kate is living in Japan? Wow, how unconspicuous she is. No one can see a tall gaijin coming from a mile away.I could continue but I stopped watching the film barely halfway through.",Kate
482,emidalmasso,Best action movie in a very long time.,8,16 September 2021,"Not too much to say, a great action movie with really good characters and high level scenes, was fun all the time and didn't felt like it was trying too hard like most terrible movies do lately. Just sit and enjoy.",Kate
483,ibyrne-809-718513,"Same violent action formula, still good",7,16 October 2021,"Like some other reviews would suggest, this is another clone in the John Wick style, revenge story with ultra choreographed violence. And if you're into that sort of thing... It's great.Never boring, and it's what you want from an action film. Entertainment. M. E. Winstead is a good action star.",Kate
484,Orsomesauce,Loved It,9,12 September 2021,I went into the movie not expecting to much but I loved the atmosphere of it.. ok so the story is a bit generic but so was John Wick and I found Kate and JW a joy to watch. I would do yourself a favour and watch this movie despite what some of the reviews because Iv noticed that a lot of the bad reviews are written by men that can't handle a woman running around with a pistol. It's not epic in any way but if you love corny kind of action movies then you'll love this and also the Japanese neon style is a nice touch.,Kate
485,rdageorge,Barely an original thought,2,17 September 2021,"In the first 30 mins I, who is far from an expert, spotted blatant rip-offs of the following: Bladerunner/ Leon / Lost in Translation / Kill Bill / Ghost in the Shell (see poster)So utterly boring to watch someone pay 2nd rate homage to these movies..why did Woody H sign up to this? Also should point out the rubbish fight sequences!Avoid.",Kate
486,faraz-ehjaz,Female version of John Wick,8,19 September 2021,"If you liked John Wick, then you will definitely like ""Kate"".Just think of Kate as a female version of John Wick, packed with action and ... gore!Another thing i noticed is that if Ripley from Aliens, would ever get a daughter, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, her look and feel in Kate, would be an absolute amazing resemblance as Ripley's daughter!!",Kate
487,qbowling,mad libs scripts,1,16 September 2021,Like everyone is saying this movie is beyond predictable. The cgi car chase was hilariously bad but satisfying due to the money they dumped into that scene. Pretty corny dialogue throughout. The finale was incredibly long and had me writing this review towards the end of it. Complete waste of time for me.,Kate
488,maurizio-kaiser,Enjoyed this much more than I thought I would,8,30 September 2021,"MEW is amazing in her role as Kate, the fight scenes are brutal and oh so well executed, the music is killer and the setting breathtaking. Having been to Tokyo many times it's surprising how many small cultural insights are in this movie (like the man nodding to Kate at the yakitori stand) and the interspersed Japanese is just so cool. Definitely worth watching!",Kate
489,puttcharlie,Lucy McClane doing John McClane things,8,2 October 2021,"This film was a rather fun one to watch, in that If you took into account most of Bruce Willis's roles, you could squint your eyes and imagine that his ""daughter"" followed right in his footsteps. Mary Elizabeth Winstead (who I'll admit right now I've only seen in Live Free or Die Hard before this) did a good job of playing the Nikita-du-jour and more than adequately portrayed the I'm-gonna-die-but-I'm-gonna-kill-you-first femme fatale. And like others have said, the brightly lit nighttime backdrop of Tokyo just gave the film that much more pop.That having been said, did anyone else get a giggle out of the scene where she's running down a hallway while all the glass around her is being shot up?",Kate
490,hitch-30,An unexpected surprise,10,12 September 2021,"I turned on Netflix tonight and I was attempting to find a movie to watch. This movie popped up as the featured movie & I accidentally pressed yes.To that end, I was impressed. I did not expect to see Mary in such a picture. She has proven herself to be up to the task of being a true action hero/star. And Yes, I suspected Woody's character, But, for all the reviews that complain about ""Atomic Blonde"" and ""crank"", I am unconcerned.After watching this film (and at least Atomic Blonde). I feel that this is a worthy film to watch & enjoy. For, although it is a female action hero movie it is still a very human movie.Yes this film is an entirely basic plot with a female lead, it could be said that it has the similar plot as many male movies too. But more than that it is a film about understanding. Kate realizes things that are revealed at the end of the story. Which I shall not reveal.To that end, I recommend this movie.Watch it, and make up your own mind.As I have said in the past, I have seen many movies, but, I only watch good ones. This is a good one.:)",Kate
491,kagenosamurai,Better than it appears to be.,8,15 September 2021,"All in all, the whole movie trope has been done before, but then again so has many other movies that we go and see repeatedly.The cast did well with their roles, making every scene notable. The ""twist"" wasn't a twist at all, however even with all that it's still a well made and enjoyable film for action lovers.",Kate

494,gt-47609,Generic,2,13 September 2021,"The worst car chase ever. Bad acting (except Woody). Lead actress looks like she's in bad shape. Weak fighting. Extra points for Harrelson, who's sadly underutilized.",Kate

496,theprincesar,Childish despite of the great amount of bad words,3,16 September 2021,"Maybe I'm not an action movies fan, but I do enjoy some of it from time to time. This time unfortunately I didn't.Kate the protagonist is an assassin who does what she told but eventually feels something is off and lives with her gilt. They try to kill her but she ""of course"" seeks revenge and transform into the 2021 Kill Bill. Despite her lethal health condition she manages to wipe out a whole Japanese clan in one day, dodge thousand of bullets, take her magical energy shots to keep her alive and finally find the ""BonBon lemon juice"" she's been searching for from the start of the movie, which apparently gives super powers!And yeah, too much bad words without context.",Kate
497,mumblesh,By the Numbers Netflix Movie,5,12 September 2021,"So ok this is my take. Every year the big studios are handed scripts, many scripts and many are rejected. How many scripts with the whole ""trained assassin"" have we seen? Netflix must get thousands with the same bloody main plot, and reject them. Warner Bros, Sony probably do too and keep maybe 2 out of a hundred. Netflix, on the other hand, get (say) a hundred of these assassin scripts and keep 50, and seemingly work through them making movies to fill a need. They love them. They tolerate much more, lame and average scripts, than you would expect a movie studio to... but then they are essentially a TV station, and have more time to fill.This film is your typical double-hard assassin movie. Well made - I like the lead and supporting cast - plus it looks good, is watchable, but ultimately is generic and predictably unoriginal. The plot will have no surprises, and will be the least interesting aspect, but it won't offend you too much either. Maybe as a slightly older person, I have seen too many movies like this to be involved and excited by it. Were I half my age, with less experience of such film, I might have better things to say. As it stands, if you like this kind of assassin getting revenge movie, you'll have a good time. Just do not expect anything new here.",Kate

Having been living in Shanghai for three years, a town with similar size of Tokyo. ...and having visited Tokyo and Japan on several occassions...I have to say that Kate is the closest thing to film noir and my favorite Blade Runner feeling that I really wasn't expecting.It will be way more graphically violent and by all means and NO SF at all. Simply a 40 year old younger movie with the true grit feeling you would be looking for, enjoying a soothing smoky scotch on a dark October night.",Kate

For a Netflix film, I thought this was pretty good. Decent action, simple plot, and one of the few streaming movies that had my subwoofer banging. Yes, it's a bit of a cliché, but I need to see some senseless revenge killing to keep me entertained until John Wick 4 comes out.",Kate

506,ghott-06357,Makes no sense,2,4 October 2021,"The actions and attitude of the main actress make us feel like V betrayed Kate, but once we think carefully he really didn't. He didn't order the killing of Kate and is furious about it. No he didn't tell Kate who the employer is but he had no reason to do so, and i dont think Kate ever asked or cared this in their partnership. So why the non sensical vengeful vibe(to V) here?There are also a lot of meaningless unreal scenes here. No one can just stand up and walk if took a assault rifle shot in around the ankle, even if the feet was luckily still attached to the leg after that. I just don't see why these scenes need to be there.",Kate
