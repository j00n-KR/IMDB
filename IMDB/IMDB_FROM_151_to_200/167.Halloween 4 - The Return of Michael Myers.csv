0,TheLittleSongbird,The watchable return of Michael Myers,5,15 January 2018,"John Carpenter's 1978 'Halloween' is wholly deserving of its status as a horror classic. To this day it's still one of the freakiest films personally seen and introduced the world to one of horror's most iconic villainous characters Michael Myers.Which is why it is such a shame that not only are all of the sequels nowhere near as good but that the decline in quality is so drastic. Ok, the original 'Halloween' is very difficult to follow on from, but most of the sequels could at least looked like effort was made into them. 'Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers' may still be no great shakes but actually is one of the better and more watchable 'Halloween' sequels, better than the previous two sequels and much better than most of the ones that were to follow. Lets start with what is good first. Donald Pleasance and Danielle Harris are very good, particularly Pleasance, who is just as creepy and deranged as Michael Myers himself. Ellie Cornell is sweet without being too much so and doesn't overdo it too much.A few of the deaths are unsettling, especially the first one, and the settings and the music score are suitably eerie. Things are taken more seriously than the previous two sequels and it's not as stupid or illogical while the characters are nowhere near as annoying as before. Praise is given for returning back to its roots somewhat and it feels more of a 'Halloween' film than 'Season of the Witch' which tried to do something different but failed.However, 'Halloween 4' has its issues. Pleasance, Harris and Cornell aside, the acting really isn't worth mentioning, something that was expected but even by 'Halloween' sequel standards it was really terrible. The less said about the even worse script the better, was not expecting much from the dialogue in the first place but again by the sequel standards the cringe factor was high. The characters may not be as annoying here but they are incredibly dull.Praise is to be given for returning back to its roots, as said, but like the second film it is too much of a bland retread with very little, if anything new, with scares, chills and suspense seriously lacking and most of the deaths having little imagination or the shock factor. The ending didn't feel that well rounded off, some of the film is sluggishly paced and directed (but not as inept as in 'Season of the Witch') and the cinematography on the most part is too dark.In conclusion, watchable if no great shakes. 5/10 Bethany Cox",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
1,Leofwine_draca,It all goes downhill from here,5,27 February 2011,"To my mind, HALLOWEEN 4 marks the beginning of the 'unnecessary' sequel stage in the Halloween franchise – from this film onwards, none of the films were required, and none add anything to the canon or display any kind of artistic merit on their own grounds. The first movie is, of course, one of the best horror films of all time, and the sequel was a fun follow-up that held true in its own right. The third film admirably went off in a different direction, and perhaps the series would have done better to stick with this unrelated theme, but it wasn't to be and the endless Michael Myers reruns were to follow from here.Compared to later films, HALLOWEEN 4 isn't all that bad. It holds fairly true as a standalone slasher film, throwing in various cheesy set-pieces, a couple of bits of unpleasant gore and a mini siege scenario at the climax whereby the survivors hide out in a house. A lot of the goodwill I feel towards this film comes from the presence of good old Donald Pleasence, really the only actor of note appearing here; he chews the scenery with relish and provides all of the movie's best lines. With his scarred face and pronounced limp, Pleasence has turned into a larger than life character, displaying even more presence than Michael himself. The sub-plot involving Danielle Harris as Michael's niece is by-the-by, to be honest.",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
2,SnoopyStyle,Intro Danielle Harris and Donald Pleasence returns,5,20 October 2013,"It's Halloween 1988 and Michael Myers rises again to hunt down his niece Jamie Lloyd (Danielle Harris). She lives with her adoptive family and is haunted by an evil that she doesn't understand. Rachel tells her that her mother Laurie used to babysit her. Dr Loomis (Donald Pleasence) is convinced that Myers is back but nobody believes him. So he goes to town where the Sheriff was much more cooperative. As she goes trick or treating, Loomis must save her from Michael.After all the hate from #3 where the Michael Myers storyline was abandoned, this one continues it with the introduction of Jamie Lloyd. Putting a cute little kid in danger is probably still taboo. They rolled the dice with Danielle Harris and luckily, she's up to the task. By keeping a tie to Laurie Strode and returning the wonderful Donald Pleasence, they are able to successfully reboot this franchise. There is a crazy twist at the end which holds great promise but is never delivered in Halloween 5.",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
3,Sleepin_Dragon,It's surprising how good this film is.,7,12 November 2020,"After Halloween three, it was obvious that for this franchise to work on.any level, it needed The Boogeyman, it needed Michael Myers.Ignore the plot, there isn't one, and there is no logic to any of the films, but this film, against all odds, is pretty good. I'd argue it's better than Halloween II, it's certainly less cliché ridden.The question you'll be asking, what is Michael Myers now, he was shot, blown up, he's clearly not a man anymore. Anyway, he's back, and that's a good thing.It's well paced, menacing, if features some nice references to the past, including the clown costume. They naturally increased the levels of violence, some scene ls are pretty nasty. The rocking chair scene is an outstanding moment of Horror, and the ending is really rather good.Sometimes the sound is very tinny, hard to believe it was produced ten years after the first, which is so slick.It's not perfect, but it is a very good horror film. 7/10",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
4,gavin6942,Still a Decent Film,6,3 November 2010,"Laurie Strode was killed in a car crash, but left behind a daughter, Jamie Lloyd (Danielle Harris). This doesn't sit well with Michael Myers, who escapes once again and tries to kill his niece! Mike Mayo says of this film ""Woof!"" (his way of saying a waste of time), and Howard Maxford gives it a moderate ""reasonable"". I'd say it's better than reasonable, though you have to admit the plot is bit shaky: we can't get Jamie Lee Curtis (heck, even John Carpenter didn't touch this) so we'll say she died and has a daughter. Weak.But, thankfully, this brought Danielle Harris into the world of horror. Harris is a wonderful person and a great actress. Despite her character's constant whining, she brings a strong character for being such a young girl (she does even better in the next installment). So, thank you for that.This could be the turning point in the series, as part five introduces the cult idea... and that will prove to be the death of ""Halloween"".",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
5,lee_eisenberg,Picking up from #2...,5,21 March 2006,"Those psycho killers just won't stay dead, will they?!!!!!!! After it looked like Michael Myers got killed in #2 (#3 - although interesting -wasn't really part of the series), he comes back to kill his niece (Jamie Lee Curtis's character was allegedly killed in a car wreck). Needless to say, Dr. Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasance) is instantly on his tail. Also needless to say, Michael kills as many people as possible throughout the movie.Anyway, ""Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers"" is nothing that you wouldn't expect. Except maybe for the end. And personally, I'd like Michael, Freddy, and Jason to all duke it out one day. That would truly be THE battle royale.",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
6,jboothmillard,Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers,3,1 November 2010,"After the disaster that was Halloween III: Season of the Witch where Michael Myers was dropped and replaced with a stupid demonic masks story, thank god they brought him back. Basically it has been ten years since the incidents of the first (and second) film, and neither Dr. Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasence) nor Michael Myers (George P. Wilbur) died in the fire at the hospital. While Loomis escaped with only scars on his cheek, Michael went into a coma and while being transferred to Richmond Mental Institute he wakes and overhears that he has a niece. The niece, daughter of Laurie Strode who is supposedly dead, little Jamie Lloyd (Danielle Harris) is the adopted daughter of the Carruthers family, with step-daughter Rachel (Ellie Cornell) living in Haddonfield. Halloween night approaches and Michael, who Jamie has been dreaming of, has arrived to find his next victim, and many more besides, with Loomis not far behind. As the bodies pile up, Loomis tries to get the police to search for the killer and protect Jamie, but the power lines have been taken down. After a chase over rooftops and so on, it looks like Michael is dead from and being gunned down into a mine shaft, but Loomis screams in horror seeing Jamie in her clown costume with a blood covered knife just like little Michael was in the fist film. Also starring Michael Pataki as Dr. Hoffman, Beau Starr as Sheriff Ben Meeker, Kathleen Kinmont as Kelly Meeker, Sasha Jenson as Brady, Gene Ross as Earl and Carmen Filpi as Rev. Jackson P. Sayer. The deaths are reasonable with their goriness, Myers may not have the original William Shatner mask but is still creepy, Pleasance is alright, and there are one or two okay jumps, all in all, an improvement on the previous film, but a silly and pretty forgettable horror sequel. Adequate!",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
7,Woodyanders,A worthy entry in the popular slice'n'dice series,8,5 March 2013,"Michael Myers (a fearsome mute portrayal by George P. Wilbur) awakens from a decade long coma and returns to Haddonfield, Illinois to kill his young niece Jamie (a fine and appealing performance by the adorable Danielle Harris in her theatrical film debut). Can the ever-obsessive Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasence in terrific lively form) stop Myers before it's too late? Director Dwight H. Little, working from a compact and compelling script by Alan B. McElroy, keeps the narrative moving along at a constant quick pace, generates a considerable amount of tension, and wisely eschews cheap scares and excessive graphic gore in favor of nicely recapturing the spooky ooga-booga atmosphere of the '78 original. The sturdy acting by the bang-up cast helps a whole lot: Ellie Cornell contributes an excellent and endearing turn as Jamie's sweet and protective stepsister Rachel, Michael Pataki makes the most out of his rather minor role as Loomis' stern nemesis Dr. Hoffman, Beau Starr cuts an imposing figure as the hard-nosed Sheriff Ben Meeker, buxom blonde bombshell Kathleen Kinmont burns up the screen as shameless slut Kelly, Sasha Jenson jerks it up well as horny hunk Brady, S.F. Brownrigg movie regular Gene Ross pops up as excitable redneck vigilante posse ringleader Earl, and familiar character actor Carmen Filpi has a stand-out colorful cameo as crazy alcoholic preacherman Rev. Jackson P. Sayer, who gives Loomis a lift in his rusty old pick-up truck into Haddonfield and recognizes Loomis as a kindred spirit on a similar mission hunting evil incarnate on earth. The central concept of Myers as a pure personification of relentless and dangerous unthinking evil gets handled with commendable sincerity and seriousness by the filmmakers. The winningly warm and natural chemistry between Harris and Cornell rates as another major asset. Composer Alan Howarth delivers several nifty shivery variants on John Carpenter's classic score. The polished cinematography by Peter Lyons Collister makes extremely effective use of shadowy lighting and a fluid Steadicam. A solid slasher picture.",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
8,ma-cortes,violent and bloody sequel with the usual carnage,5,29 July 2005,"It has passed longtime since the psycho Michael Meyers executed the butcher in Haddonfield(Illinois) for Halloween night.Now day ,one decade later,Myers is found inmate at a psychiatric asylum,although is transfered to other hospital.Myers escapes during the travel,starting a savage and brutal slaughter.Doctor Loomis(Donald Pleasence),Dr. Hoffman(Michael Pataki)and a sheriff(Beau Starr) set off in pursuit of him. Myers has only an objective,kill to his nephew Jamie(Danielle Harris)who's cared by her sister(Elie Cornell).The new destination is Haddonfield and the arrival date , Halloween night.Since the presentation Michael Myers mask wearing executes a series of bodycount scabrously and cruelly assassinated. The film is a spine-tingler shocker that has grisly horror,suspense,terrifying screams,tense,shocks and great loads of blood,guts and gore. Myers makes a real massacre and are utilized in the gruesome and nauseating killing ,knife,cleaver and the supernatural brute force originating a gory massacre.From the beginning to end the horror and terror is continued and varied. John Carpenter music,habitual and basic element of series is electrify and frightening. The storyline remain the similar happenings and characters as well as predecessors films as successors with the sole exception of ¨Halloween 3: season of witch¨(Tommy Lee Wallace) that changes the events. The same protagonists,Elie Cornell,Danielle Harris and of course Donald Pleasence will play the following up ¨Halloween 5 the revenge of Michael Myers¨(Dominique Othenin Gerard). The picture is regularly directed by Dwight H. Little. The movie will like to Halloween series fans.",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
9,BA_Harrison,Michael Myers returns to Haddonfield to 'up' his kill total!,7,14 September 2006,"Ten years after the original massacre in sleepy Haddonfield, Michael Myers escapes from his sanatorium and pays the residents of his hometown another visit, hacking and slashing his way towards his ultimate target: his niece, Jamie Lloyd (who is staying with a foster family).Also returning for episode IV of the Halloween series is Dr. Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasance), who hasn't given up on trying to stop the relentless killer from his murderous antics. Following a trail of corpses, he tracks the masked maniac to Haddonfield, where he alerts the local sheriff, who helps him to locate Jamie (and her foster sister, Ellie) before Michael can slice 'n' dice the poor girl.But with both the town's power and telephones having been knocked out by the knife-wielding psycho, all they can do is barricade themselves into the sheriff's house and hope that help arrives before Michael does.Director Dwight H. Little delivers an impressive fourth chapter in the successful series which, after the enjoyably silly (but unconnected) third movie, returns the action to the sleepy town where it all began. He cranks up the tension nicely and manages to scare without having to resort to cheap shocks or over-the-top gore; the level of bloodletting is extremely low, much like John Carpenter's first movie.An 11-year old Danielle Harris, as young Jamie, is thoroughly convincing as the terrified girl with the bogeyman as an uncle. Rachel Carruthers is equally as good as her protective foster sister, Ellie. Horror stalwart Donald Pleasance can do no wrong as far as I am concerned and he puts in another solid performance as the doctor who is almost as indestructible as his nemesis.And whilst I'm on the subject of impressive performances, Kathleen Kinmont is completely unforgettable as the big-breasted daughter of the sheriff, who adds a welcome dash of T&A to proceedings.A nice shock ending rounds off what is one of the best of the Halloween movies so far (at least until Rob Zombie's movie hits the big screen in '07, which I have high hopes for after being greatly impressed by The Devils Rejects).***2014 EDIT*** Sadly, RZ's Halloween was a steaming pile of ****, as was the sequel!",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
10,Quinoa1984,At least it't not #3,4,18 July 2000,"This chapter in the Michael Myers series makes a new plot line for Myers to chop up as (it seems) the daughter of Jamie Lee Curtis (and Myers nephew) is now being hunted by the ressurected Michael Myers.  Pleasence is good, which helps,and there are some thrills.  But that might be it.  Not the best in the 8 part series (I just found out its 8), but worth watching, especially before watching part 5 and 6.  B",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
11,Coventry,The night he came home...again and again and again,4,14 November 2004,"After episode 3 without Michael Myers (Season of the Witch, which turned out a marketing-mistake and a giant flop) the Halloween franchise urgently needed his charismatic knife-wielder Michael back in order to make more cash. So here we see how Myers all of a sudden wakes up from his coma during a transport from a maximum security prison to a normal hospital. While stiffing a few innocent bystanders, he heads back to his hometown Haddonfield where his little niece  the cherubic Jamie Lloyd  is his next target. The decrepit looking Donald Pleasance continues to chase him and constantly tries to make people aware that Michael Myers actually is EVILon two legs. For some reason, this fourth chapter is immensely popular among horror fans. I fail to see why as it features the same old elements like the town under siege, dumb coppers and shotgun-swinging hillbillies. In fact, the best parts of the entire movie are the different shots featuring during the opening credits. Here, we see creepy images of Halloween-related scenery on remote locations. Excuse me for saying it but the rest of part IV is dull! Most of the killings are off-screen and even the ones we're witnessing are as good as bloodless. Michael is tame and the film takes itself far too serious. I easily prefer the Friday the 13th series and Jason Vorhees would beat Myers without even trying.",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers

Donald Pleasence returns as Dr. Loomis. The charming Ellie Cornell plays Rachel. Beau Starr has the role of Sheriff Meeker and Kathleen Kinmont is quite fetching as Kelly Meeker. Harris is dutiful in her debut. Nerve wrecking...more creepy than scary.",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
13,hitchcockthelegend,"Apocalypse, End of the World, Armageddon. It's always got a face and a name.",7,21 October 2015,"After Halloween III veered in a new direction without Michael Myers, the indestructible killing machine of the franchise, the rights to the series changed hands and so it came to pass that part 4 (though part 3 in essence) brought Myers back. After being in a coma for ten years Myers is up for a transfer to a sanitarium, but wouldn't you know it, he wakes up and upon hearing he has a niece back in Haddonfield, he sets off on a murderous rampage back to where it all began.It's one of the Halloween sequels that causes much debate among the series' fans, there are those who decry its lack of blood and its ordinary screenplay (both viable complaints), and those such as myself who like that it reverts back to what made the series start so brilliantly. Including a superbly devilish nod to the start of the 78 film.Haddonfield becomes a town under siege, this the work of one monster, or as Donald Pleasence's scar faced doctor says - ""evil on two legs"". Myers once again is just glimpsed here and there, adding that unearthly suspense factor, until he hones in on his niece and her foster sister and the pursuit begins. Some of the interim characterisations are padding out the run time, the usual teen angst romantic flannel, but Pleasence's determined Dr. Loomis is never far away to remind us that everyone is doomed! Then of course there's the ending, which is an absolute beaut.There's no brains on offer here, but it's a worthy sequel and a good tracer line for its iconic bogeyman. The story has moved on to another level and leaves the fans hankering for more. 7/10",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
14,Theo Robertson,Watchable Enough...,5,12 November 2004,"... But the plot is wearing thin Since HALLOWEEN 3: SEASON OF THE WITCH has absolutely nothing to do with the franchise this is regarded as the second sequel of the franchise started by John Carpenter's 1978 movie . To be honest there's not much milage to make a franchise since the plot of every film revolves around Dr Loomis saying something like "" I spent ten years trying to cure the child then the rest of my life trying to kill him "" , nobody believing him and all the cynics and horny teenagers getting killed I will confess that HALLOWEEN 4: THE RETURN OF MICHAEL MYERS is fairly watchable even for someone like myself who isn't obbsessed with the horror genre . I think perhaps that it's not too dissimilar to THE TERMINATOR might have something to do with this , but it's still miles better than JEEPERS CREEPER . Even the rubbish acting scenes like Danielle Harris trying to look upset at the playground taunts and Donald Pleasence screaming "" NOOOOO NOOOOO NOOOOO "" at the shock ending have some entertainment value",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers

16,Hey_Sweden,"""You can't kill damnation, mister. It don't die like a man dies.""",7,5 November 2014,"After the disappointing box office results for ""Halloween III: Season of the Witch"", the producers realized what they had to do to bring in the bucks again: bring back their unstoppable franchise psycho, Michael Myers, and time it to coincide with the 10th anniversary of John Carpenters' groundbreaking original film.The result is a pretty routine slasher. By this time, of course, we know damn well what to expect, and the makers of ""Halloween 4"" aren't about to muck with a winning formula. As scripted by Alan B. McElroy and directed by Dwight H. Little, this isn't without its moments (the rooftop chase scene is one that people remember) even if it's not exactly inspired.After the hospital explosion that concluded ""Halloween II"", 10 years go by, and the comatose Michael Myers revives while being transported by ambulance. He learns that he's got a niece, sired by his now apparently deceased sister Laurie Strode. So he heads back to his old stamping ground of Haddonfield for the usual murder and mayhem, all in the name of killing this young relative of his.Fortunately, the movie benefits a lot from the presence of the late Donald Pleasence, who truly was the heart and soul of this franchise for 17 years. Once again he lends tons of gravitas to the proceedings, and we root for him to exorcise this demon from his life. It's also easy enough to root for our young characters; Ellie Cornell as teenager Rachel Carruthers is cute and appealing in a wholesome, non-flashy way, and film-debuting Danielle Harris is adorable as the niece Jamie. This time Michael Myers is played by stuntman George P. Wilbur, who fails to make Myers particularly creepy. (The horrible mask is another debit.) Character actors Beau Starr and Michael Pataki lend solid support, and the delectable Kathleen Kinmont adds a great deal of sex appeal as the self-serving Kelly. There is an extremely memorable supporting character in the form of Carmen Filpi's wandering reverend, Jack Sayer. It's a nice sequence where Loomis meets Sayer and realizes that he's found a kindred spirit.There is some genuine suspense and atmosphere to enjoy here (those opening credits are brilliant), although there's not very much gore. The climactic action is exciting and ridiculous in about equal measure. The ending is very striking and effective. Longtime Carpenter associate Alan Howarth does the music, using the classic themes as well as composing some of his own.Basically, ""Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers"" is good of its type, with enough filmmaking competence to counteract the familiar scenario.Seven out of 10.",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
17,Doylenf,"As a Halloween slasher, it delivers the goods...",6,25 October 2007,"The Michael Meyers figure in the mask is more sinister than ever in this better than average remake of the original HALLOWEEN movie. It's a slasher that has enough real thrills for anyone who wants to see the gore and many plot twists and turns.DONALD PLEASANCE is still Dr. Loomis, alerting the police that Meyers has escaped and is back in Haddonfield looking to murder his niece, DANIELLE HARRIS. Harris is a wonderful child actress who looks genuinely frightened throughout the story and convincingly goes through the paces, as do all the other members of an excellent cast. ELLIE CORNELL and SASHA JENSON do well as the conventional teen-aged leads.If slasher films of this genre are your thing, this is a better script than you might expect from this franchise.On the other hand, if you've seen the original film with Jamie Lee Curtis, there's an awful lot of familiarity in the plot line. But as a Halloween slasher, it delivers the goods. Summing up: Probably one of the best sequels in this series.",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
18,preppy-3,For a sequel it was pretty good,6,25 October 2008,"This picks up 10 years after ""Halloween"" (which is correct--this WAS released 10 years after the original). Michael Myers is being transported to a hospital and he hears he has a 9 year old niece (Danielle Harris) still alive. He quickly escapes from the ambulance (after killing everybody) and heads back to Haddonfield to kill her. Dr. Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasence) is hot on his trail. We're supposed to believe him and Michael survived the blast from the end of ""Halloween 2""! For a sequel it's not bad. This one thankfully doesn't go for nonstop graphic gore (like ""Halloween 2"") and is pretty tame. There IS some gore but it's mild compared to other 80s slasher films. There's good acting by Pleasance, Ellie Dornell (as Rachel) and Harris is incredible. There's also a nice restrained use of the original ""Halloween"" score. And the ending is GREAT! However there are problems with this. Continuity error abound; Myers hair turns WHITE twice (!!!); he can seemingly transport himself to wherever the victim is (must have taken lessons from Jason Voorhees) and Harris' character goes through an amazing amount of abuse for any child (but it does figure into the ending).I caught this in a theatre back in 1988 and was underwhelmed--but it was MUCH better than ""Halloween 5"" (which followed the next year).

19,poolandrews,Has it's good points... but has it's bad ones also.,5,22 August 2006,"Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers starts on the 30th October 1988 as homicidal maniac Michael Myers (George P. Wilbur) is about to be transfered from one hospital to another for reasons that are never really explained. Anyway as the ambulance speeds along Michael suddenly wakes up from his comatose state & kills his escort's... The next day in Haddonfield, Illinois & it's Halloween as the daughter of Laurie Strode & Michael Myers niece Jamie Lloyd (Danielle Harris) is getting on with her life with her foster parents & foster sister Rachel (Ellie Cornell) whom she plans to go trick or treating with. Meanwhile Michael Myers is in town & since his sister Laurie is dead he turns his attention to his last remaining blood relative Jamie whom he is intent on killing along with anyone else who gets in his way. Can Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasence) get to Jamie before Michael & save her?Directed by Dwight H. Little this was the fourth instalment in the Halloween series of films which now totals eight & lets not forget the proposed Halloween (1978) remake to be directed by Rob Zombie that is due for release sometime in 2007... This particular entry came after the critical & financial failure of the much underrated (in my opinion anyway) Halloween III: Season of the Witch (1982), the filmmakers obviously felt turning the series into another Friday the 13th (1980) franchise was the way to go, although it came before they started to add stupid supernatural elements to the plot to try & explain Michaels origins as in a couple of the subsequent sequels. It was written by Alan B. McElroy & I thought the basic story was better than the usual teen slasher film, there's slightly more to it than I expected with fairly decent character's including a child star who isn't annoying or irritating & tight story along with one or two nice scenes. However I have a huge problem with Halloween 4: The Return of Micheal Myers & that is quite simply that not enough happens in it & is almost totally bloodless. Looking at the 'Trivia' section for Hallowween 4: The Return of Michael Myers it says that the film was originally considered too 'soft' (their description, not mine) & that special effects man John Carl Buechler was brought in & shot the films only two gory scenes which, if true, tells you everything you need to know really, this is one seriously tame film & on that front it was a big disappointment. I mean I ain't watching this crap for a deep meaningful storyline that will change the way I look at life am I? No, I want Michael Myers killing people & half decent story, the decent story is there but the killing isn't I'm afraid. I also want to mention the twist ending which I thought was great & very effective especially if you've seen the previous entries.Director Little shows his action film roots with a few OK car stunts & an exploding gas station, the kills are tame & while there is a decent atmosphere & a reasonable build-up there just isn't any pay-off or reward as it's just all so tame & forgettable. There is a nice style about the film with some nice lighting & use of light & shadow. Gore wise someone has a thumb stuck in their forehead, someone has a shotgun shoved through their stomach (off screen) & someone has their throat ripped open (definitely one of Buechler's added effects scenes) & a few after-the-fact dead bodies.With a healthy sounding budget of about $5,000,000 Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers is well made & has nice enough production values, the acting was OK but nothing overly special & I have to mention the young Harris who does a nice job.Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers has me in two minds, I liked the story & character's within more than the usual slasher clone but at the same time the fact that it's just so tame & has a very low body count makes it impossible for me to recommend. Average, there are better entries in the Halloween series & I'd personally take just about any Friday the 13th over this.",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
20,utgard14,Nothing New But Good of Its Type,6,3 November 2013,"Halloween 4 was a return to the Michael Myers saga after the terrific but under-appreciated Halloween 3 tried something new. So they went back to the slasher basics. Halloween 4 offers nothing new really. Yes, they replace Laurie Strode with Jamie Lloyd but otherwise it's simply a movie about Michael coming after a girl while all these other people get in his way and are killed for it.It's a very basic formula and how much patience one has for it will probably depend on how worn out on slashers you feel at the time you watch it. In many ways it owes more to the Friday the 13th franchise than Carpenter's Halloween. When it first came out I thought it was crappy. Years later I have come to appreciate the few merits it does have and admit it's an entertaining film, despite its lack of freshness. It's also a movie that has developed a cult following over the years and is responsible, in large part I believe, for the cult status of limited but likable actress Danielle Harris.Donald Pleasence returns to the series as Dr. Loomis and, once again, is the highlight of the movie. As with Halloween 2, the direction is below John Carpenter's effort but there are some well-directed scenes. Kathleen Kinmont provides the eye candy and Ellie Cornell is the good girl. All in all, it's an enjoyable sequel though nothing special. Give it a shot if you're in the mood for a good slasher to kill time with.",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
21,Boba_Fett1138,Still a good movie within its genre.,7,13 September 2009,"Because this is the already fourth establishment in the Halloween-series, this movie has always been a bit under-appreciated. After the failed attempt at a different approach that ""Halloween III: Season of the Witch"" was, this fourth movie goes back to its roots again and the movie can be simply called a good and effective one within the slasher-genre, which the first movie from 1978 firstly really defined.The movie is far from being perfect though with its story that is just plain ridicules and just too hard to believe at times. The movie at times is being too simple and light about things and often simply just takes things from granted, even though as a viewer you'll hardly ever buy these things. Still the movie is good enough to serve as one that is typical and good enough for its genre. It has all the clichés you can expect but as a fan of the genre you'll hardly ever complain about these things.It's main concept still works out better than I anticipated though. I mean, Michael Myers who is after his 7-year old niece this time didn't sounded very appealing or exciting to me at first. Luckily it still works out so because the movie also features some other good characters, on which the movie concentrates just as much.I must say that Donald Pleasence was truly excellent in his role. He impressed me more than he ever did before in any of the other previous Halloween-movies.As an horror/slasher it perhaps isn't being the most original or bloodiest movie within its genre but it's being simply good and generic enough to please the fans of the genre, as long as they are open for a third sequel to a movie that redefined the genre for ever. Of course this movie doesn't ever reaches the level of the first ""Halloween"" but on its own right this movie is simply being a good one that is still very well worth watching and is much better than most other genre movies and certainly much better than most sequels to horror movies.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
22,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,See? He's in this one! Happy now?,5,1 February 2010,"Well, the masses won. To not tear this one completely to bits, I'll try not to compare it to the original all that much. Like the second one, this gives Michael a POV(and in general needs to do better at hiding him and giving him effective reveals), which was only done a few times in the first; it also isn't always well-lit, though it isn't as bad with either as II was. In spite of using the classic theme(and they may have done a thing or two to it, but it remains great), and possibly trying, this never manages to build and maintain mood or atmosphere. They didn't have to go with hicks and lynch-mobs earlier... sorry. OK, those were the last ones, I promise. This is a straight slasher, so I will try to treat it as exactly that. Since they didn't have a lot to work with as far as his motivation goes, they resorted to using the one reason that had already been established, however stupid it is. So, with Jamie Lee Curtis not returning, they killed her off and gave her a girl. Danielle Harris was a fine enough actor(unfortunately, she's one of the only ones in this), she's got a set of lungs on her for all the screaming(not to mention, she sure grew up to be hot); with that said, her role is whiny and needy(look, there's more than one way to be an orphan, and not all them make you irritating). In fact, the characters in this that aren't so bland you barely notice their presence all seem to be participating in some contest to be the most obnoxious. We don't get to care about any of them. Loomis is again yelling his lines. The plot is nearly non-existent, and purely there to set the stage for knifing. I wish I could claim that this is a worthy addition to the sub-genre... if nothing else, it isn't that known for having high standards(on that, the FX are good, and the deaths not the least creative I've seen). Meanwhile, with so many cheap scares that do not pay off, the ""cat jumping out from the dark"" type, a disappointing finale(and the ending, for the idea of it having potential, is surprisingly ""meh""), little(which is not to say ""none"") eye-candy for young males and a nearly utter lack of suspense, I cannot. There is plenty of brutal, bloody and gory violence, relatively infrequent moderate to strong language and brief gratuitous sexuality and nudity. The DVD holds a trailer for this and one for 5. I recommend these 80 minutes solely to those who can't do without Myers(or just a generic big guy murdering teenagers), regardless of the quality of the flick. 5/10",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
23,view_and_review,He's Baaaack!,5,30 September 2019,"After a lousy Halloween part three sans Michael Myers, the Halloween franchise decided to bring him back. Sure, there was the minor issue of Michael Myers being burned to a crisp in the hospital fire in part deux but what is a raging inferno to someone of Michael's caliber? Death is a mere hurdle in the race called life for killers like Michael, Jason, Freddy, et al. We need only decent writers to figure a clever way out of the death pickle.As it turns out, neither Michael nor Dr. Loomis were killed in that five-alarm hospital blaze. Oh Joy! Michael is still alive, but who shall he kill? Laurie is not around and she was the sole object of his desire. Well, apparently Laurie had a little girl named Jamie (Danielle Harris) and somehow Michael knows about her. This dude has a sixth sense when it comes to his sister. He escaped custody, again, in order to go after little Jamie. Jamie will need the protection of everyone in the town of Haddonfield, IL if she is to survive Michael.Where do I rank this episode compared to the previous three? Better than part three (but that's not saying much), but significantly worse than parts one and two. Those parts gave us a fresh new Michael Myers ardently pursuing Laurie Strode being played by Jamie Lee Curtis. Even Donald Pleasance as Dr. Loomis was better in those two. Now, the story is a bit wonky with the whole ""he didn't die in the fire now he's after his niece"" angle. The main characters besides Michael and Dr. Loomis don't have the same appeal either. Michael is a force and always will be, it's the quality of his prey that make or break the movie, and a helpless little girl isn't high quality.",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
24,Uriah43,Doesn't Quite Measure Up to Its Expectations,5,7 March 2017,"This movie begins with the transfer of the psychopath named ""Michael Myers"" (George P. Wilbur) in an ambulance from a mental institution to a state-run facility on the night of October 30, 1988. Not unsurprisingly, even though he is fully medicated, he manages to escape and the first place he heads for is the nearby town of Haddonfield where he had committed a number of grisly murders ten years earlier. Yet, even though in the previous movies (specifically Halloween I & II) he had sets his sights on his sister, this time he decides to target his young 7 year-old niece ""Jamie Lloyd"" (Danielle Harris) instead. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that--even though I criticized Halloween III for departing from the Michael Myers theme-this film doesn't quite measure up to the first two movies either. For starters, it doesn't have nearly as much suspense or drama and the ending is somewhat botched as well. But even so it wasn't necessarily bad and for that reason I have rated it accordingly. Average.",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
25,kannibalcorpsegrinder,Incredibly impressive sequel that outshines the original,10,23 July 2012,"When he manages to escape from a local asylum and returns to his hometown, the legendary killer's murderous search for a missing relative forces his doctor and the locals into a panic trying to protect her as he gets continuously closer to her.This one ended up being a massively enjoyable and entertaining effort that produces some of the best stuff around in the series baring the original, and oftentimes even surpassing it. A lot of the film's positives here are all helped along by the more physically-imposing and traditionally-minded slasher approach given to Michael. By now, Myers had become very Jason Voorhees-esquire in that no matter what was brought to bear on him, he would still survive, and that gives this one a great main villain as he continually charges forth against all the big scenes here to stop him by surviving a multitude of gunshots, car crashes and the big final resolution here. As well, from a pure slashing standpoint, this also means his behavior is more slasher-feeling by actively stalking and killing more random bystanders since There's a larger cast that allows for more kills and gore here as this is one of the series' bloodier entries. Moreover, that leads into the plethora of amazing action-packed stalking here as there's no shortage of awesome scenes here, from the confrontation at the car-repair shop that features some fine stalking around before the explosive resolution and a series of scenes involving the lynch mob's confrontations in the streets providing some really fun times here as well as chasing him through the neighborhoods. Still, it's hard to beat this one's best part here in the final half, as the home invasion get so much right here with the blackout hiding the bodies, the rampage across the group and then stalking them up to the rood which leads to a thrilling escape attempt as it closes in on them and leads to the confrontation in the school. Eventually, the ensuing car chase and battle at the creek afterward serve as more action-oriented scenes that generate a faster-paced film than anything else in the series. The fast pace makes the movie seem much shorter than it really is, and is misleading since the action flies fast and free and is able to work nicely alongside all the other parts here. The movie also does something only the original took pride in doing as it never forsakes the suspense and manages to get a lot of them right, effectively bringing in some fine suspense along with the action, and in fact it rarely misses of the scenes it set up. The opportunities are varied, but this movie still gets quite a high number including the opening dream sequence that goes for several minutes, and Myers is never seen until the last thirty seconds popping up from under the bed illuminated by the lightning blast and the costume-shopping sequence is also a nice display of suspense with the mysterious figure stalking her throughout the store, and altogether there's a lot to like here with this one's mixture of impressive stalking action and suspense this one really gets right. Beyond these issues, there's only one real problematic issue here on the stupidity of the town's people over Myers. The fact that Loomis spends so much time convincing them to do something after the previous rampages that it nearly detracts from the movie and there's very little believability in that part. Scenes like the police station assault should've prompted them into action much earlier, but instead it barely registers at all to get them to move into action until the house assault. It's really the film's main flaw overall here.Rated R: Graphic Violence, Adult Language, Brief Nudity and some drug use",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers

Dr. Loomis is alerted by the state troopers after the ambulance is found with blood everywhere. Myers has already started to make his way toward Haddonfield, where he confronts his niece in a pharmacy, and then kills the town's phone & power lines leaving his niece and adopted sister trapped.Now he's coming to pay young Jamie a visit....In some sort of way, it was a smart move to bring Myers back after the experiment with the very good third movie, but it's more or less more of the same, Myers stalking family and killing silly people in wonderful ways, without even doing anything more than a slight stroll,Back in 1988, i'm sure this would have been an awesome release, especially as at the time, Jason and Freddy were slightly losing there appeal, but twenty five years later, it's doesn't hold up too well.Performances are okay, especially Harris and Pleasence, but the rest of the young cast are just Myers fodder, waiting for him to walk slowly toward them.All in all, if you are a completest, it's worth seeing, just don't expect too much.",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
28,movieman_kev,the last even half-way decent film in the franchise,7,15 October 2005,"The last Halloween film that was even halfway decent, this one picks up years after the events of Part 2 (part 3 was a stand-alone story having nothing to do with Mike Myers and the least said of that film, the better). Micheal awakens from a coma and escapes from the transport that was moving him to another hospital to continue his rampage of death & destruction. This time the focus of his killing rage is not on Laurie Strode, but his nephew Jamie Lloyd, a young girl who is petrified by the concept of Halloween and has visions of Myers. This was the most intense one behind the original of course. But just a word of warning: watch parts 1,2, and 4 ONLY. After that you're on your own and I won't be held responsible for the unneeded trauma you'll endure by being a cinema maschocist and enduring the other truly awful movies in the series.Eye Candy: Kathleen Kinmont gets topless My Grade: B- DVD Extras: 17 minute ""Final Cut"" featurette; and Theatrical Trailer Notes: Mine came in a limited edition tin casing",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
29,Aaron1375,"Okay, so we are going to ignore the fact that both Myers and Loomis burned to death.",5,6 November 2003,"An almost good sequel, that falls prey to many wtf moments and the fact that this sequel just shouldn't have been made. With Halloween you have part 1 and 2, which go together. 3 isn't really related to the series much at all, then you can pick your sequels. Either 4, 5, and 6...or you can choose 7, 8, and soon to be 9 as the sequels as your choice. My choice is neither, I will always think of part 2 as the end of Myers and Loomis, if you saw the way Myers was killed and the fact the flames burned his face so bad you could make out his skull then you would consider him dead too. That and his eyes were shot out. People, though, just loved Myers as a killer too much so they brought him back in a sequel that almost works. Myers eyes are never explained, I mean they would transplant eyes onto a comatose serial killer would they? However, both he and the good doctor Loomis played by Donald Pleasance who is a bright spot in this movie have some minor burns. Both were engulfed in flames, but they only have simple scars from the flames here and there. This time Myers is going after his niece, and man the girl who is playing her is awful and she doesn't improve in the next installment. Myers goes on a rampage killing people while Loomis tracks him down. Nothing new or original and for some reason I just don't get the Halloween vibe I got from the first two. In the first two the trick or treaters seemed real, here it all seems to set up. As for the wtf moments, one occurs when the niece and her sister (apparently the niece was adopted after her mother was killed in a wreck and that would have been the Jamie Lee Curtis character) are on a roof. Myers is up there too, and the girls fall off, less than 5 seconds later Myers is on the ground again coming from behind the house. How the heck did he get down so fast? Were there stairs behind the house? The next moment is when they are on a truck with a posse heading for the state police headquarters. Somehow Myers comes from underneath the truck and starts killing. This is impossible as a scene earlier clearly showed no one was under the truck. There are a couple more of these moments. However, this one has its moments and it to me is a better sequel than any that came after it including the H2O one.",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
30,Wuchakk,Better than the original; and one of the best 80's slashers,9,15 August 2018,"Ten years after the events of ""Halloween"" and ""Halloween II"" (which both took place on Halloween night, 1978), Michael Myers escapes captivity a second time and again returns to his hometown in Illinois with a direly concerned Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasence) hot on his trail. Myers goes after his sister's daughter, Jamie, and is willing to take down the whole town of Haddonfield if necessary.""Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers"" (1988) ranks with the best 80's slasher flicks and is actually superior to the somewhat overrated progenitor of the genre, ""Halloween"" (1978). Whereas the original ""Halloween"" was an effective low-key but classy slasher and deserves credit for starting the craze, it wasn't without flaws and ""Halloween 4"" (1.) fixes those issues and (2.) improves upon its strengths.For instance, while the original movie takes place during Halloween in Illinois, you certainly wouldn't know this by the footage since it clearly looks like summer. This movie, by contrast, definitely looks like it takes place during the fall and has an all-around superior Halloween ambiance with trick-or-treaters and so forth. Another example is the original's lack of drive and the fact that Michael only kills a few teenagers and doesn't seem all that formidable whilst this film features a mounting build-up of suspense and potently conveys Michael's deadly formidableness while upping the ante in the body count.Other advances includes the lack of lame dialogue (like in the original when the girls were walking home) and Dr. Loomis has much more interesting things to do than lurk in the bushes by the Myer's dilapidated abode speaking ridiculously ominous words. When Loomis speaks portentously in this entry there's great reason to believe him (take, for instance, what happens to the Police Station).Yet another (arguable) improvement is the women: Although Jamie Lee Curtis, Nancy Kyes (Loomis) and PJ Soles were fine in the original, ""Halloween 4"" has winsome Ellie Cornell as Rachel and hottie Kathleen Kinmont as Kelly and the movie wisely takes advantage of their presence in a classy way. Rachel may not strike you as anything special at first, but as the story progresses she emerges as an attractive and noble final girl.The ""Friday the 13th"" franchise debuted two years after ""Halloween"" in 1980; and by October, 1988, when this film was released, the ""Friday"" franchise had no less than seven films under its belt. Meanwhile, ""Halloween 4"" was only the third Michael Myers movie (keeping in mind that ""Halloween 3"" was curiously disconnected from the Michael Myers mythos).""Friday the 13th"" of course ripped-off ""Halloween,"" but simultaneously added original components to the genre (e.g. summer camp and everything revolving around it, easily the best females in the slasher genre, as well as an increasingly devolving supernatural killing machine). ""Halloween 4"" sort of gets its revenge by borrowing from the ""Friday"" films; for instance, the character of Jamie Lloyd and what happens to her mirrors Tommy Jarvis' story arc from 3-4 years earlier. Perhaps the greatest revenge is that ""Halloween 4"" is better than any of the ""Friday"" sequels after ""Part 2"" and is at least as effective as ""Part 2.""The original ""Halloween"" was shot in the Los Angeles area (South Pasadena & Hollywood) while this one was filmed in the Salt Lake City, Utah, region. Like the first film, it's streamlined and doesn't overstay its welcome.GRADE: A",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
31,The_Void,More rubbish from the Halloween people,6,24 January 2005,"Halloween 4 is a thought provoking drama that asks an intriguing question of it's audience - namely, ""why are you watching this?"". So come on, you've already wasted your time on three horrible Halloween movies, why are you back for more? Are you a sucker for punishment? Do you like terrible films with little or no redeeming qualities? Do you enjoy seeing monotonous movies that are exactly the same as the last instalment, or was there simply nothing else on? The latter is this film fan's excuse, and I sincerely hope that's yours too as this movie is seriously terrible, and I'd hate to think that somebody actually caught it on purpose.As you may have guessed from the tagline, this sequel features the return of cinema's most boring villain - Michael Myers. Groan. Halloween 3 was rubbish, but you have to respect it for trying to take the series in a different direction and do something a little bit original. Of course, we'd have been better off without any sequels, but you can't expect a teen-friendly series like Halloween to disappear after just one outing. Also making a comeback for this sequel is Donald Pleasance, who reprises his role as Michael Myers' doctor and biggest fan, Dr Loomis. Pleasance spends the entire movie bigging up Myers; if he's not telling people that Myers cant be stopped, he's trying to convince them that he actually is evil on two legs...and it all gets rather boring very quickly. By this point you'll probably be thinking ""ah, but at least there's a few murders to enjoy"" - but no! There are murders, but in typical Halloween down style, they're boring, and not only that but they're either extremely tame or take place off screen! Boooooooo...To the film's credit, it does feature some nice scenes of atmosphere, and at least the campy style can be amusing, if not quite 'so bad it's good'. I certainly don't recommend this trash to anyone, as it's a complete and utter waste of time. Avoid.",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
32,trashgang,great performance of Danielle Harris,6,15 November 2011,"The year is 1988 and horror is, forgive me the pun, dead. Freddy and Jason went on to become laughable in their franchise but the only one that had came to a halt was Halloween. Producer Moustapha Akkad decided that it was time to return to the original masked slasher that put the franchise on the map. With some strikes on their way the writers had to hurry (11 days) up to write this flick and another thing was that John Carpenter and Jamie Lee Curtis had left the franchise.The story picks up were part 2 ended so that was a good thing to start with but from then on I wasn't attracted to the screen anymore. In stead of the hunter tracking down his victims this is more the hunter becoming the hunted. On the other hands due the departure of Jamie they needed something to replace Laurie Strode. What could be easier to say she had a little child but Laurie had passed away. So in came Jamie Lloyd played by Danielle Harris. And let me just say that she was eleven when she was deputing in her first feature and what an excellent job she did. But one actor couldn't save a picture. The others were okay but I just couldn't get involved in feeling an affection towards them. On the other hand Michael was played by George P. Wilbur, who also appeared as Michael in The Curse of Michael Myers. And he just copied the original Michael, in fact the whole thing was a copy of Carpenter's direction. you know, Michael appearing from a dark hole or out of the darkness. But George couldn't convince me in Michael, even his mask wasn't convincing for me. Everybody was glad that Michael came back and luckily Donald Pleasence was back as Dr Loomis but it was a bad time for horror, the slashers were death and also this entry was low on on-camera killings or gore. Kathleen Kinmont was the only one who gave a bit of flesh but overall it was a bit of a let down. It took a while before things started although the ending was okay.

Why do they transport that guy! In typical 80's horror fashion there is lots of eye candy, alpha characters both female/male, T @ A, good looking people who know how to party, balanced with dorks and bad decision making.

35,StevePulaski,A Return Which Wont Changed If Missed,5,4 July 2010,"Myers absence in Halloween III: Season of the Witch struck fans as a surprise seeing he isn't he even as close to be mentioned in it. Many fans consider it the worst in the entire Halloween franchise. A few years later fans were reunited with the mask slasher in the fourth sequel Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers.The plot is rather decently sized for a slasher flick, especially for the 80s. People seem to like when I dub a slasher flick usually ""slim and slender"" before I elaborate my like or dislike towards the film. But this one has a new phrase, a bit more to adore.Jamie Lloyd (Danielle Harris) is a lonely girl who seems even lonely after her parents have just died. She is left in care of her step mother, father, and her sister Rachell (Ellie Cornell). Her uncle, also known as the serial killer of the town were she resides, Haddonfield, Michael Myers has just awakened from a ten year acoma and is back to find Jamie and slaughter everyone in his path.We occasionally get Dr. Samuel Loomis popping up at various times. He is cool to see in the first parts, but as the film gets better and better, you sort of wish he would stop making random on screen appearances as he usually distorts the action.The plot is really enough to keep me interested rather than a group of brain dead adolescents who encounter Jason while having a sex filled potfest. The kills in the movie, are fair, but really not spectacular or memorable. The characters are likable and shockingly interesting at points in the film as well. Michael Myers, is at his worst, showing no mercy to Rachel and Jamie, or anyone in his way. The film is creepy in points, though pretty shallow at other times.All in all, it's a mediocre slasher that gets dry and limp after a while. The movie was shocking for the time, and considered a great sequel. But I think fans were too excited because they hadnt seen Myers since 1981. I will try and find time to watch Halloween 5, but after this, I'm in no hurry.Starring: Donald Pleasence, Ellie Cornell, Danielle Harris, Michael Pataki, Beau Starr, Kathleen Kinmont, and Sasha Jenson.

Huh?",6,21 October 2004,"After the failure that was the 3rd Halloween sequel, the writers knew that was mainly due to the absence of Michael Myers. So what did they do? They invited Michael back in for the 4th sequel and back into the story of Halloween. Even though I did enjoy the 3rd sequel, I do agree that I missed Michael. He's my favorite boogeyman, so it'd be cool to see him return and do what he does best, slice and dice and scare the heck out of me. Well is this really scary? Not too much, but still it's a fun sequel to get into and watch in the dark. I like the story and how they are continuing into the Myer's past and how far Michael will go to destroy this blood line. Although I was disappointed to not have Laurie Strode in this one, it was interesting to see how her legacy lives on with her daughter and now she will have the struggle with Michael Myers.Michael Myers has been in a coma for ten years, when his massacre was stopped by Dr. Samuel J. Loomis and Laurie Strode. Myers is being transferred from Ridgemont Federal Sanitarium to Smith's Grove Sanitarium. He awakens when he hears that Laurie Strode, his sister, is deceased, but her daughter, Jamie Lloyd is alive and well in Haddonfield. He kills the ambulance crew and escapes. Dr. Loomis races to Haddonfield in an attempt to bring Myers' killing spree to an end once and for all. In Haddonfield, his niece Jamie Lloyd, has been adopted by the Carruthers family. She has frequent nightmares about Michael, though she does not know who he is. On Halloween night, Jamie goes out trick-or-treating dressed as a clown with her teenage foster sister Rachel. Her uncle, Michael, follows them. Meanwhile, Loomis arrives in Haddonfield after an exhausting journey, and contacts the police department to inform them of Myers' escape. He and Haddonfield's new Sheriff Ben Meeker begin to search the town for Michael and Jamie. Myers has also blacked out the town's electricity by throwing a technician onto a electrical box and singlehandedly annihilated the entire police force. The girls barricade themselves in the Sheriff's house, while awaiting the arrival of the state police where Michael follows them and you'll have to see the movie to see the exciting conclusion.So over all Halloween 4 is a good sequel, it's not the strongest in the series, but it's one of the better stories of the franchise. I do like Jamie Lloyd, she was an interesting addition to the story and the writers are making these movies very interesting. I'm glad they brought Dr. Loomis back in, it brings us back into the original Halloween and he'll never give up until Michael Myers is gone for good, which we know is not going to happen since we still have 4 more sequels after this one. But the 4th installment into the Halloween franchise is a good one so I do recommend that you see it if you get the chance.6/10",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers

While they didn't bombard us with the original theme music (again) they proved two things in the subtitle: this is an event movie for fans and this is ""make-up"" movie for those missing Myers from #3. I don't really want to say it went downhill from there as it wasn't that bad, just average. Standard horror made up of two remakes: first 2/3rds is almost a word-for-word redux of #1 and the last third is a rehash of just about any 'Friday the 13th.' A patient, Myers, is to be transferred (due to federal laws) and escapes, heading back to Haddonfield, Ill. Sound familiar? There's more: his own doctor doesn't approve and gives ineffective speeches to those not listening and heads to Haddonfield, seeing destruction along the way, and aids police in the search. I know we've seen this before Oh, and Myers's main goal is to kill a female member of his family. Yeah, pretty much a remake of the original, just updated for a new, younger and profitable crowd. Then the movie gears towards an unstoppable, inhumanly strong teleporter (he's all over the place/town in seconds) Jason Voorhees-type in a house with clichéd cutouts. While I liked the opening credits, the best part of the film happens in the last few seconds. Of course, I won't give that away, however predictable it is. The fact that this twist happens at all makes up for its unoriginality, clichés and flaws. Speaking of which: since when can a character see/fear objects (ambulance) and people she's never encountered? Heck, Myers hadn't even picked up his new mask yet. When he does, it's the least scary of all. It's actually, unintentionally, I presume, comical.Side Note: I hate it when the cover/poster doesn't match the character within the movie. (I.E. Pretty Woman's dress was a different color, for whatever reason) This mask on the cover is NOT the same one in the film, or I could've taken him more seriously or be somewhat frightened. Instead they got some clown mask – perhaps its symbolism to represent the other clown in the movie that represents another clown in the originalOh, I think I'm getting too deep for a ""Part 4"" in a horror franchise.Side Note 2: All negativity aside, I was pleased they did put some budget into this, and it certainly paid off. The budget had to have succeeded the first 3 combined.",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
40,bensonmum2,"""Ten years ago, he tried to kill Laurie Strode. Now he wants her daughter.""",7,15 November 2019,"The quote I used as a title for this pretty well summarizes the plot. Michael Myers escapes, heads back to Haddonfield, and goes on a killing spree while searching for his niece.Until the other night, I hadn't seen Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers in years, but it's much better than I remember. Of all of the sequels in the original Halloween line, this one might just be the best. I know a lot of people prefer Halloween II or H2O, but for me, this one comes closest to capturing the spirit of the original. Halloween 4 has a similar feel to it with plenty of atmosphere and chills. The scenes of Michael stalking Jamie and Rachel are especially creepy. As with the first film, for whatever reason, I find the daytime stalking scenes incredibly effective. And the rooftop escape sequence near the end is just plain old thrilling. Halloween 4 features a nice cast - better than you'll find in the average Halloween sequel. Donald Pleasence gives his usual over-the-top, but totally enjoyable performance. Young Danielle Harris, in her first real role, is a stand-out. She may be the best thing Halloween 4 has going for it. She's that good. The rest of the cast, including Ellie Cornell and Beau Starr, is very strong. While I do have some issues with the plot - the notion of transporting Michael at night in a driving thunderstorm, a niece Michael knows nothing about until he accidentally over-hears someone talking about her, Michael' ability to walk / drive around town without drawing attention to himself, etc - it's nowhere near as whacky and off-the-rails as the sequels to follow. Plus, there's none of the Thorn nonsense that's introduced in Part 5. It may seem petty, I guess one of my biggest complaints with Halloween 4 is that awful looking mask. The white is so bright, it pretty much glows. And what's with the hair? Looks like someone used a tub of pomade to smooth it down.Overall, Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers is worthy successor to the original. While it never reaches that level of brilliance, it's far superior to a lot of the dreck that followed.7/10",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
41,gridoon,Just fair.,6,26 February 2001,"I had heard and read a lot about this movie being the best sequel to the original ""Halloween"", so I must say that I was somewhat disappointed by the result - although it IS superior to the overrated ""Halloween H20"". The series had already become so formulaic by that point that the elements of suspense and surprise had pretty much evaporated. This is basically a run-of-the-mill (and somewhat bland) slasher film. But there are redeeming qualities: good acting by Pleasence (he's positively chilling in his final scene), Cornell (just SO sweet!) and Harris, a great ending, some imaginative touches (like the appearance of multiple Michaels in one almost surrealistic scene) and the competently executed action set pieces. The killings themselves, however, lack originality; only the first one (a grisly thumb-through-the-forehead thing) really stands out. (**)",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
42,lost-in-limbo,It's that time of the year again. So guess who's back?,6,16 January 2010,"It had been a couple years since the last Halloween sequel (1982 Halloween III: Season of the Witch) that didn't even feature the iconic Michael Myers. But the fourth entry in the series would see the return of Myers and 'the persistent Dr. Loomis, but Laurie Strode was no where to be seen other than some photos. Here the target happens to be Laurie's daughter Jamie, who's being looked after by carers. So Michael didn't die in the oxygen tank explosion at end of ""Halloween 2"", but was badly burned and Loomis has the scares to show it too. It has been ten years since Myers went on his brutal rampage through the quiet rural town of Haddonfield on Halloween eve / night. During a stormy / rainy night Myers in a comatose state is being transported from a maximum security institution for the criminally insane to another. However through the journey he awakes and escapes. Dr. Loomis appears on the scene when he hears about the news and quickly gets on Myers' trail to a place he knows well; Haddonfield.""Halloween IV: The Return of Michael Myers"" is a surprisingly good, if quick low-budget sequel (although definitely one of the better inclusions of the franchise), quite primitively textbook but effectively done stalk and slash item. What I find it has going for it is that it does drum some creepy atmospherics (like its forlorn opening credits), which is guided by Alan Howarth's excellently ominous, alienating music score filled with many uneasy cues and he captures Carpenter's unnerving trademark theme to the bone. They obviously showed a lot faith in Howarth and he always did an outstanding job, as he would compose Halloween 2 through to 6. Director Dwight H. Little's touch can get stuffy, but remains conventionally tight and efficient. Where he unexpectedly builds tension quite well in a fast-moving cat and mouse format, but where he shines here is in his composition and positional handling of some moodily striking imagery. The fuzzy lighting, shadowy locations of Haddonfield at night time is stylishly orchestrated with moon and mist filling the quiet streets, where Myers (aka The Shape) just seems to blend within the backdrop to suddenly appear. The simple layered story does that a lot, where Myers would just appear out of nowhere. Sometimes dubiously how can that be, but these illogical inclusions you take with a grain of salt since we're talking about Myers here. There's a real brutal and cold-blooded side to the murders, but they're not particularly explicit. The performances are very well brought across. Donald Pleasance chews up the scenery, but hasn't entirely broken into his hysterical mould (well that's until it's emotionally jarring conclusion) with a more collected turn with the infatuation slowly getting to him. A wonderful Danielle Harris gives a genuinely moving performance that only makes the film's lasting nasty final shock more gut-busting and a delectable Ellie Cornell is likable. Beau Starr and Michael Pataki offer solid support too. George P. Wilbur portrays Michael Myers with lethal precision and pure emotionless, as he creates such an uneasy vibe to how he gets around.",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
43,ericstevenson,"Yeah, bad",5,15 October 2017,"After the commercial failure of ""Halloween III: Season Of The Witch"", the ""Halloween"" franchise decided to go back to making all of their movies about Michael Myers. I admit this film isn't terrible but it really is bad. Michael Myers returns to kill his niece. Honestly, this movie just come across as being bland. There was nothing interesting about it at all. Like all slasher movies, this was when the series started becoming repetitive. It's Michael killing members of his family and that's about it.The only thing I could really remember as being different was when the niece attacks the woman at the end. Maybe it's just because that was the end! Donald Pleasance as Dr. Loomis appears in this and he basically just gives the same speeches and the same ways to kill Michael that he did in the previous movie. This film is just pointless as Michael obviously isn't dead, but I suppose there's nothing to really hate because it's just another slasher movie, which I'm not a fan of.

45,CuriosityKilledShawn,Shockingly bad!,1,16 May 2004,"It's frightening to think that if this movie was never made we would never have been subjected to the dreck that is Halloween 5, 6, 7 and 8. And the double shame is that even tho the story here is silly it is at least interesting. The continuation of this was the only decent thing about Halloween 5 and it may well have been good in 6 too but that movie all rearranged and jumbled before it hit out screens.So what we have here is a collection of dull murders with bad story continuity. H20 and Resurrection pretended that 4, 5 and 6 never happened. There is no REAL backbone or history to this series. All they represent is a producer who asks us to pay money for the same thing over and over. We cannot use photocopied money to pay for our tickets at the box office so the movie-makers owe us something new. And in Halloween 4 we don't get it. In fact I'm sure that to the untrained eye Halloween 4 and 5 could very well be the same movie.And it is SO slow! Nothing really happens for about 70 minutes worth of the movies 88 minute running time. It leaves you begging for a Jason Voorhees style mass murder spree. That does not happen I'm sorry to say. The movie cuts away at the point of every death and when it doesn't the deaths are dull and boring. A man is thrown onto an electrical power grid and...sparks fly. That's it? How about his face melting or at least getting set on fire? Plus the body count is shockingly low. What is up with the thumb thru the head? Not only is it badly shot, too quick and just plain puzzling (surely a quick neck snap would be easier and nastier) the physical possibilities of it match hammering a tack into a concrete slab. It just can't happen. I don't care how superhuman Michael Myers unexplained powers are.The whole 'motiveless psycho' may have worked well in Carpenter's original but here it's asking for money for old rope. Carpenter used it to great effect and scriptwriter Alan B. McElroy (responsible for some awesome Spawn episodes) uses it as an excuse for lazy, unimaginative writing. Tho he has the scriptwriters strike to blame as he beat the deadline by mere hours. But even a few hours worth more imagination could have made this the tiniest bit better.There's just not much for Myers to do. He comes out of a coma, goes back to Haddonfield and kills. For no reason. There are no sets other than houses and no opportunity for big excitement or set-pieces. I'm sorry but the 'famous' rooftop scene is boring, badly rehearsed and badly shot. Director Dwight H. Little (Marked For Death, Murder at 1600) even throws in a 10 second scene in an Elementary school for no reason. Plus the only shot of Michael in this shows him with WHITE hair on his mask. A pretty big goof, lookout for it.Out of all the lessons in how to make an effective horror film that were were taught in the first film none of them are really echoed here. Slasher flicks by their very nature are low brow but Carpenter had a simplistic purity and charm that made it work. Plus he filmed the movie in Panavision which instantly gives it some class. Plus he used the widescreen framing well. Dwight H. Little seems oblivious to this and instead uses standard 1.85:1 widescreen with no particular flare. And I must mention the very poor dialogue. It offers no insight into the lives of the teenagers in the story or provides them with extra character. Why are we supposed to care when they get killed. It's obvious from the beginning that they are nothing but fodder for Michael Myers. And it's a crime that when they die it's not even graphic or ugly in the slightest. Just boring and badly shot. It's not a horror film because nothing horrifies or upsets other than paying money to see it. Stay well away. Go watch a Friday the 13th movie and see the J-Man do his thing. Anchor Bay presents this DVD in 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen. The print is grainy and rather dirty. Nothing of reference quality. Sorry. There soundtrack has been remastered in Dolby Digital 5.1 from the original Ultra Stereo tracks. It's good enough. One hardly expects a sophisticated soundtrack from a film of this nature. In fact I prefer it to the obnoxiously loud sound designs of more recent slasher flicks.A 16 minute documentary, offering new interesting insight to the movie, is included. The participants don't have much to say and seem to regard the film in a higher manner than it deserves. An original theatrical poster replica poses as the cover on a '4-page booklet' (wow-1 sheet of paper) containing some more info about the movie. The DVD itself comes in one of those beautiful Limited Edition Tins. My copy is number 05,194/40,000.",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers

47,Bored_Dragon,Cops do it by the book,5,11 January 2019,"After the first two movies, the rest of the franchise has quite a bad reputation and, after the terrible third installment, I was at the edge of giving up on it. However, my masochistic OCD could not leave me be. I had to continue. ""The Return of Michael Myers"" is a fairly decent film in every respect, and observed separately, an average horror of the eighties. But as the fourth part of the ""Halloween"", this film brings nothing new, neither technically nor essentially, and in no way contributes to the franchise. Basically, it reprises its predecessors with a new cast and, while not bad, it is completely unneeded, redundant, and if you watched the previous parts, quite boring. However, there are a couple of interesting attributes. For maintaining a decent level of tension in the second part of the movie I assign it one point. Another point for the performance of Danielle Harris, who, for an eleven-years-old, has played the lead very well. It earned the third point with a quite good ending twist. And finally, one more point for each of Kathleen Kinmont's boobs.5/10",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers

49,ironhorse_iv,Halloween 4 is more like Shalloween.4: the return of recycle old concepts.,5,31 October 2016,"As the title suggests, this film marks the return of the serial killer, Michael Myers (George P. Wilbur) after being absent in the previous installment, 1982's 'Halloween III: Season of the Witch' that has nothing to do with the first two movies. Initially, both the original writer and producer, John Carpenter and Debra Hill wanted to retired the Michael Myers storyline after the second installment of the series, intending to feature a new Halloween-season-related plot every sequel, of which Halloween III would be the first, however, due to the disappointing financial performance of the third film, Halloween 4 reintroduced the character, instead of another story. In this film, it reveals that Michael indeed survived the fire in 1981's 'Halloween II', but has been in a coma since that night. While being transferred back to mental asylum, Michael comes out of his coma and overhears that original character, Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis), has died in a car accident. Instead of moving on, he chose to kill the daughter of his once-arch enemy, Jamie Lloyd (Danielle Harris) with Dr. Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasence) once more trying to stop him. If this formula sounds like a rethread, then you're correct. Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to say, I was really disappointed by this move. I understand that Jamie Lee Curtis couldn't return as Laurie Strode, due to working on another film project, but couldn't they had her for a small cameo, instead of having her character die, off-screen, or wait for her other film to be done. Don't get me wrong, I dig the idea of Myers trying to kill a kid. I just wish, the movie was a little bit smarter with it. I kinda like John Carpenter's idea of having Myers being more of ghost. It would explain, the off-screen teleportation in which, Myers can suddenly appear in front of their intended victims despite said victims clearly being able to out-run them. Trust me, it makes more sense than Myers and Loomis, somehow surviving the blaze and being able to get see, despite being shot in both eyes. The psychological approach would add something unique. It would be, something very similar to 1980's 'The Shining'. Yet, this concept was rejected by the producers in favor of the typical slasher film with more nudity and gore, similar to then- highly popular, Friday the 13th film franchise. The film even stole the whole 1985's 'Friday the 13th Part V: A New Beginning' twist ending with a protagonist being portray as the next serial killer in the series. Sadly, this was the point, where Carpenter bailed out of the film series, and never return. Thank God, 1989's 'Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers' didn't continue with this, as that would be a bad idea, but I did like Danielle Harris's performance. She did a hell of a job, acting scare. However, the movie doesn't do a great job in explaining the backstory of how Jamie Lloyd was even born and why she is important for Myers to kill. As much as I hate 1995's 'Halloween 6: The Curse of Michael Myers', as least, it gave us, a reason why Myers was hunting Lloyd, more than this movie gave. Also, where in the hell is Jimmy Lloyd (Lance Guest), her father, or any of Strode family!? Why wasn't any of them in this movie!? It would be, better than this new supporting cast. Don't get me wrong, the actors were fine, but some of the dialogue, they were given, were too mean-spirited or cheesy. Another thing, I really didn't care about the subplot of the triangle love-story between Rachel Carruthers (Ellie Cornell) & Kelly Meeker (Kathleen Kinmont) fight over the right to be, Brady's (Sasha Jenson) girlfriend. It really doesn't affect the main plot, much. So, it felt like time-wasting. Anyways, as much as I hate the new characters, I kinda like the return of Donald Pleasence. He had a really good scene with a travelling priest, mid-way through the movie, showing foreshadowing the enduring inevitability of evil. Plus, he was still able to do some really cool action scenes and speak epic one-liners. However, I didn't like the look of Michael Myers. He looks a bit goofy here with his super white faceless facial mask. I don't know, why, but having less features in his mask, makes him look like a silly crash team dummy, instead of menacing killer. Bring back, the painted William Shatner's mask, next time! Also, why is the store selling a clown costume and Myer's mask in Haddenfield, anyways!? Also, why would anybody dress up like Michael Myers, knowing that a mob and police could shoot them? Another disappointment about this movie is the lack of suspenseful music. I hate the fact that the Halloween theme by John Carpenter isn't playing in the opening credits. It makes the film, so boring. Overall: While not seen as the best of the series, it was well-received by fans at the time of its release, and did decent business at the box office, enough to bring Michael Myers back for good. Still, the movie could had been better in my opinion. While, not great, it's still worth checking for any Halloween fan. Good for a one time watch.",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers

52,zkonedog,The Definition Of Bland,2,11 March 2017,"After the failed experiment that was ""Halloween III: Season of the Witch"", the series returned to its Michael Myers-based roots with this fourth installment. Unfortunately, the end result couldn't have turned out more bland.For a basic plot summary, ""Halloween 4"" opens with Myers having been in a coma for the ten years after the explosion that ended the second film. However, while being transferred to a new institution, Michael wakes up and begins a new killing spree, this time targeting Jamie Lloyd (Danielle Harris), the niece of Laurie Strode.Yep, seriously...that is the plot of this film, easily illustrating the most glaring fault of this ""comeback"" effort: the series was creatively exhausted after ""Halloween II"", so all the rest is just an excuse to make some money.Add to this the fact that the movie really isn't even scary. Whatsoever. Heck, even the Friday the 13th series had 3-4 films that were decent. This one, though, does nothing to re-establish the character of Michael Myers and eventually descends into a combination of slasher (which at times is laughable) and suspense (let's just say it ain't Hitchcock). Plus, to add insult to injury, the Myers mask isn't even the old ""Bill Shatner mold"" from the first two, instead featuring a cheap knockoff that isn't nearly as spooky. The final nail is driven home with the most insipid, cringe-worthy ending of perhaps the entire series.About the only redeeming factor in this movie whatsoever is the performance of Harris as young Jamie. She really does an excellent job and deserves a lot of credit for creating the only human drama element in the movie at all.Thus, though this film tried to resurrect (quite literally) the character of Michael Myers, it eventually only serves to provide 90 minutes of blandness. I wasn't expecting greatness out of the third Halloween sequel, but I wasn't expecting total boredom, either, and that is exactly what I received.",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
53,johnnyboyz,With Halloween 4; you begin to wonder if he'll ever actually get home.,5,26 November 2007,"Over the course of the years and the films, you get the feeling the Halloween series tried to branch out into something a little more epic: the first one was Myers vs. Strode in a house, at its core and the second one was Myers vs. Strode in a hospital with the third one going down a very different path. In Halloween 4 (only the third with Myers), Myers basically takes on a whole town; its police force; a bunch of rednecks out for revenge; and of course another screaming teenage girl, only it's not Laurie Strode this time.The reason for Halloween feeling more epic is that there are lots of other characters involved in this film but that doesn't necessarily make it any good. The first one was a master-class in suspense and voyeurism but the second was a boring gore fest with the third being something totally different, albeit rather good. Here, teenage girl Rachel Carruthers (Cornell) lives a normal life: at home with her parents; school trouble; boyfriend trouble, having to baby-sit her kid sister (who will need a lot of child therapy by the end); etc. so to have her resemble the traits of Laurie from the first film is a clever move. What isn't so smart is the way the film is constructed and thought through; borrowing too much from previous efforts to feel like anything new, ground breaking or even that interesting. We are given a very brief, if not crude, reminder of Michael Myers and his history by an asylum warden as he and two others descend into the depths of the asylum's cells: someone has thought of the bright idea to transfer Myers on the night of the tenth anniversary that he committed all the murders that fateful Halloween  a whole two films worth of murder, violence and gore.Of course en-route, you know what happens but of course it shouldn't have done because it's worth saying here that American serial killer Ted Bundy got the electric chair a mere year after this film was made and he wasn't too dissimilar to Myers in the sense that he maimed and killed his way through life; targeting that in particular of teenage girls of some description. But, of course; in this film's universe nobody even thinks of giving Myers the chair even if it would save a lot of life. So, with a premise that has already forced us to suspend reality a little too much; Halloween 4 begins for real. Halloween 4 still bears a lot of gimmicks and a lot of 'tut and shake your head whilst smiling in disbelief' moments. One of which is the scene in which Rachel's partner goes up against Myers on the landing: you know what will happen; another is the scene in which Rachel screams out loud that 'there's no way out!' even though there are windows all over the place but no, by all means climb out onto the house's roof. There is also the horrible scene in which Loomis (Pleasance) and the head sheriff are given separate reasons to actually leave the house thus leaving Rachel and her little sister even more venerable almost on their own.The things I don't like about Halloween stem from the fact it's just too incidental, ie; there are too many excuses and lame motivations for said events to happen. At the beginning, we are shown how the phone lines will come to not work in a disappointing and incidental fashion; we are shown much later on shots of Rachel and her baby sister running into the house's attic followed by a close up of Myers taking a random knife off a shelf that just happened to be there: did Rachel not think to grab a weapon? Did she not run past the exact same shelf? Or did the character of Myers jump a temporal filmic space downstairs into the kitchen in the space of one cut? Twinned with this, the resulting fight on the roof plays out in an oddly humorous way with Myers lumbering around with his knife and characters surviving thirty foot falls.Thankfully, the audience is spared the 'nobody believe Loomis' story from very early on and despite having one or two eerie moments with good compositions, Halloween 4 is a disappointment; even as a horror film. Halloween 4 develops into a bit of a limp 'last stand' picture with brainless character logic and incidental thrills forming the basis of its story. I liked the tracking shot of the police station after Myers had been there and his altercation with an electricity pylon worker was humorous in a sick sort of a way: ""Hey, don't try that Halloween s**t with me(!)"" but Halloween 4, unfortunately, lives up to its name: a 1980s horror sequel with a number in its title.",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers

56,insomniac_rod,Halloween 4 : a good horror movie disguised as any other slasher sequel.,6,13 November 2004,"OVERALL This is a must see for horror fans. The movie was meant to be a homage to the popular ""Halloween"" and I don't think the producers had more expectations. To these days, Halloween 4 is one of the best slasher flicks of the past 20 years and deserves a special mention for being a stand alone movie from the franchise. Sure, this is by no means better or equally good as John Carpenter's 1978 classic but it has it's own elements to be considered as a great slasher flick that could easily be watched by fans of the horror genre. Ten years have passed since Michael Myers escaped from the mental asylum and murdered three people on Halloween Night. After the terrible explosion at the local hospital that night, Michael Myers ended severely damaged and hasn't been able to wake up from a ten year old comma. It's Halloween night 1988, and after hearing about the existence of her niece Michael Myers wakes up from the comma and kills two paramedic while he was being driven to the maximum security prison. Myers once again heads to Haddonfield in order to kill his niece. Dr. Loomis also survived the explosion and he's aware of Michael's return.*SPOILERS!!!*It's hard for me to decide on which ""Halloween"" sequel is better. Part 2 was creepy and is one of the best slashers from the 80's. ""The Return"" is a solid slasher and surprisingly it handles perfectly the famous Halloween plot. The opening scene is great. The raining, the maximum security area, the man in charge of the place; the creepiness is in the atmosphere. After Michael brutally kills the two paramedics, you can feel that the movie is going in the right direction. The original ""Halloween"" was successful because it didn't need gore to shock the audience. The settings, situations, and Michael were the basic elements to create the (probably) most famous slasher from all time. ""The Return of Michael Myers"" has the basic elements from the original plus a good amount of gore, and a dark setting that fits perfect with the movie's tone. The plot keeps you interested and you never get bored. Dr. Loomis is on the hunt for Myers again but this time his mission is harder mainly because Myers proved to have some sort of ""supernatural force"" and nobody seems to stop him. In my opinion, the most important scene in the movie is when Dr. Loomis finds Michael at the gas station. Both know each other very well and after ten years, their first encounter promised a lot. The scene is shocking and sends a message to the audience towards the importance that Loomis gives to Myers return. That scene is to me one of the best moments in the series.ACTING Donald Pleasence delivers a great performance and what I like it most about it is that he gives it a special importance as if it was the role of his life. Pleasence was very involved in the series and after Myers, he's the most important character in the series. Danielle Harris also shines in the screen. Her extremely cute face makes you worry about her. The girl can act and her performance is one of the best from any child actor int he genre. GORE There are plenty of gory scenes that may please the audience. The paramedics scene is pretty gory and makes you ask for more. There's a rifle impalement, a head crushing, and some other violent scenes that make me miss the 80's slashers more. DIRECTION/SCORE/CINEMATOGRAPHY -Dwight H. Little's direction is top notch even for an 80's slasher. The man knew how to create scenes of tension and creepiness. The movie looks like a solid horror movie. After the master Carpenter, Little's direction is the best in the series. -The score is very effective. The 80's version of the classic Halloween tune is excellent! I love it. The music used in important scenes also delivered very well. When Loomis faces Myers at the gas station the score plays an important role as it starts dramatic and ends with the Halloween tune. Excellent. -The cinematography deserves a special mention because the movie is set 90% at night. There's a lot of darkness that totally sets up a very intimidating setting while Myers wanders searching for victims. When the town's electrical system is messed up by Myers; there is no more light in the movie! The darkness of the cinematography is brilliantly used in the final setting, the old house. Halloween 4 is a creepy movie mainly because it's dark cinematography. Nice one.IMPORTANT SCENES -Michael's return after the comma. -Loomis encounter with Myers at the gas station. -The shocking ending (Danielle Harris wearing THAT mask...) -The infamous rifle impalement. -Myers falling to his underground grave.8/10. Scary, intense, well directed, good acted, 80's horror movie. Recommended for fans of the genre.In my opinion if you want to experience the Halloween series, just watch the original from 1978, part 2 from 1981 and part 4 from 1988. That's it.",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
57,matthewssilverhammer,serviceable but largely forgettable,6,13 November 2018,"This is a serviceable but largely forgettable Halloween entry that raises a few questions; some bad (how is that Laurie's daughter?), some kinda cool (ooh! Is Myers' insanity hereditary?). And while much of the intrigue in this one is completely ruined by the next terrible entries, the ominous presence of Michael Myers is captured with steady creepiness.",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
58,Anonymous_Maxine,Michael Meyers going through the motions again,7,14 December 2004,"Halloween IV was marketed as the ten year anniversary of Meyers' first killing spree at least as much as it is marketed as the return of Michael Meyers to the Halloween series, or the Halloween series' return to itself, you might say. Halloween III was not so bad, but a lot of people were understandably put off because it had nothing to do with its predecessors. In this installment, almost everyone is back except for Jamie Lee Curtis, who is replaced as an intended victim surprisingly well by Meyers' niece, Jamie Lloyd, played by ten-year-old Danielle Harris.The movie starts off years after where part II left off (except that Meyers and Dr. Loomis have been brought back to life, having clearly died at the end of part II), and Meyers is finally being transferred out of the guarded hospital where he has been kept catatonic all these years. All of the employees at the hospital are relieved to see him go, because he gives the all the creeps. The situation gives the feeling that Meyers is being kept like some kind of alien that they can't figure out how to kill. Some explanation for why he was ever kept alive in the first place would have been in order, I should think.During the transfer, as is to be expected, Meyers comes alive and kills everyone in the ambulance transferring him. Accident investigators on the scene later, immediately assume everyone is dead despite not being able to find all of the bodies, and illustrate their investigative competence by more than once referring to the ambulance as a bus. What follows is a Halloween installment that is sufficiently dark and gloomy, but that is really not much more than a series of death scenes. The electrocution scene, for example, is so obviously contrived that it could just as easily have been installed just about anywhere in any of the other Halloween films.The film concerns Laurie Strode's niece, Jamie, and Strode's foster sister Rachel, who is, of course, having boy trouble. Her troubles may be a little difficult to understand, however, because not only is the object of her affection amazingly goofy looking, but he is also a complete idiot and a total jerk. In only one example of his lack of cognitive function, he doesn't know who Michael Meyers is. That's like someone in Waco, Texas having no idea why their town is famous. The difficulty I had in mourning or caring about his death was matched only by the ease with which the fate of his relationship with Rachel could be predicted.One of the only people involved in the original Halloween and the first sequel is Donald Pleasance, who always performs wonderfully but here is given nothing more than a lot of lines where he talks about pure evil and he's not human and you don't know how to stop him and he's right here in this town you have to believe me, etc. etc. etc. Given that such an important part of the series agreed to come back, after Jamie Lee Curtis and John Carpenter declined to join, it would seem that they would put a little more effort into his part.In one scene, the movie threatens to go in a bad direction, when Loomis gets out of a police car and prepares to shoot down Michael Meyers, only to discover that he is surrounded by Meyerses. The horror at the thought of Michael having multiplied is clear on his face, but as he and the shocked officer with him prepare to fire, the kids pull off their masks and run off into the night, hooting and hollering about how funny they are and how great that was. These kids are so monumentally stupid that I wish at least one of them had been shot.Later in the film, after most of the police force has been killed off in their own police station by Michael Meyers, the local rednecks decide to take matters in their own hands. Meyers has been here before, killed too many kids, and now the police station is in ruins because of a single lurching man who doesn't even use guns (at one point in this movie he is even holding a shotgun pointed at a girl, and he stabs her with it rather than shoot her, a classic Meyers move). I'd get my shotgun, too. Not that I have one. But if I did, I'd be a little more discriminating as to when I'd take a shot. In a scene soon thereafter, the men see some movement in the bushes and they all unload on it, killing one of their friends. Nice. I love their strategy - everyone get their shotguns, and let's all pile into Earl's pickup truck and blow the hell out of anything that moves! Or Steve's truck, or Bill's, or whoever's it was. The best part was that when they got within shooting distance of Meyers, they all gave up and decided to leave it to the authorities.However, it should be noted that the tripe with which Halloween IV is filled is followed by a VERY impressive ending, which is the best ending that this movie could possibly have had and is also a tremendous homage to the original Halloween. It is very difficult for horror movies, especially when they are already getting up there in sequel numbers themselves, to have an ending that leaves the story open for yet another sequel. Most of the time a high-numbered sequel with an open ending makes me think something like Oh god, they're gonna do another one. Halloween IV, for all its flaws, not only doesn't do that, but it has such a good ending that it almost makes up for the rest of the garbage in the film. Were the rest of the movie as good as the ending, this would have been another classic.",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
59,gwnightscream,Not Bad Halloween Sequel!,5,27 February 2012,"Donald Pleasence, Danielle Harris and Ellie Cornell star in this 1988 horror sequel. This installment picks up 10 years after the events of the first 2 films with killer, Michael Myers (George Wilbur) awakening from a coma badly burned and killing a group of medics transferring him. Dr. Sam Loomis (Pleasence) now slightly disfigured on one side of his face, learns that Michael has escaped and returned to Haddonfield, Illinois for his niece, Jamie Lloyd (Harris). Jamie is adopted by the Carruthers family after her mother, Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) died in a car accident. Loomis tries to get to her before Michael does and Cornell plays her foster sister, Rachel who also becomes hunted by Michael. This isn't a bad sequel, it definitely has that autumn tone, Pleasence, Harris & Cornell are great in it and who can forget the ending. I recommend this.",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
60,GOWBTW,Now that is a sequel!,9,2 November 2018,"This is a comeback from the 3rd installment of a horror series. Since part 3 killed him off completely, this part makes it worth it while. On the second installment of Halloween, Michael Myers was blinded by bullets and caught in a explosion by Dr. Loomis( Donald Pleasance).
Instead of killing him, he was an invalid, until he started to recover during his transfer to another sanitarium. En route to the sanitarium, he killed the people in the ambulance. And would make his way back to Haddonfield, Illinois. 10 years ago, Michael killed his older sister. He would attack his other sister and killed her other friends. While incarceration, Laurie has a daughter, when she died, the daughter was raised by her stepsister and family. Knowing that her uncle is a killer, it would make her a black sheep to the neighborhood. So, when Michael Myers comes back to town, the killings began anew. And Dr. Loomis would be coming back to stop the menace once again.
Part 4 would help remind me of the original nightmare scenario of the first killings. He did kill more people than he did in the earlier years. There's more sex appeal there. The love scene was the hottest thing ever.
I just enjoyed this movie a lot, even though it didn't have Jamie Lee Curtis in it, it was great anyway.

61,FiendishDramaturgy,A perfect continuation of the original.,8,15 September 2004,"Picking up where Halloween 2 left off, (as though 3 never existed, thankfully) this sequel goes a long way in living up to the first two Halloweens.First of all, Danielle Harris is pure talent! Secondly, Donald Pleasence is as excellent as he ever was! Regardless of what some critics will say, this critic says this sequel is very worthy of the Halloween line.Michael has been transferred out of the institute and Loomis's care. Of course, he escapes and is on the rampage once again. Our trusty Dr. Loomis is hot on his trail. Michael has to get back to Haddenfield so he can play slice n dice with Laurie Strode's daughter, Jamie (a completely professional performance by Danielle Harris).One thing of note in this installment of the franchise is that director Little used some interesting lighting in many sequences here. I enjoyed the photographic perspective employed here. It lent to a much better endeavor.I must say that this bore a compelling story which ran well with the Halloween time line. It is solid and well done all around. The portrayals were decent, the direction was wonderful and the editing was fluid, leaving no choppy spots. I also must say that I found the change in Michael's mask to be a bad change. I realize that at some point they had to get rid of the William Shatner mask, but the new mask is rather stark and detracts just the tiniest bit from the atmosphere.That having been said, the atmosphere is GREAT! This is a prime demonstration of suspenseful, edge of your seat fare. This particular vein of the Michael Myers story is really a quite interesting take on the whole affair and Danielle Harris is the freshest innovation to come to the series so far. I can't wait to see what she does with her career in the future. That little girl is fantastic!!While the Carpenter/Hill idea to have a different story every Halloween was a grand idea, they should have done it with the first sequel. That would have made it much more acceptable from the fans. But either way, welcome back, Michael. Just like the original, this rates a solid 8/10 from...the Fiend :.",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
62,jtindahouse,Makes up for a slow start with a great final act,7,11 November 2019,"About two thirds of the way through 'Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers' I was ready to crucify it in my review. I was so bored it wasn't funny. Everything that I loved so much about 'Halloween 2' was missing. And everything that I liked about the original 'Halloween' was missing as well. It was the worst of both worlds. Then the final act kicked in however, and suddenly I was having a great time.The final act in this film is absolutely top notch. It is clever, brutal, suspenseful and filmed at an extreme pace. Then to top it off there is a final twist that I never saw coming. If the beginning of the movie could have just kept things a little more interesting and had a bit more going on this could have gone down as a horror classic. Mind you I think it is still pretty well respected even as it is. My advice would be to battle your way through the dull stuff and then reward yourself with the treat that is the final 30 minutes or so.",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers

Poor Dr. Loomis, not only he didn't do his job and treat Michael of his psychosis but now he carries the burden of having to rid the earth of the mindless monster. After spending years off and on in rehab and intensive care and therapy, the good doctor has finally found him. But will he be ofany help? An adequate sequel. Neither horrible nor terrible. Recommended for Michael Myers fans (the killer smart guy, not the actor) and lovers of 80's horror films. Since this movie was filmed in the 80's, multiple sequels were mandatory. The Halloween franchise was lacking in this department so two of them were made back to back to satisfy the quota.

64,Bezenby,Michael Myers returns to Haddonfield yet again,6,27 February 2014,"Michae Myers is back! And this time, well, to be honest he's just doing what he usually does – which is running around Haddonfield killing people while Donald Pleasance runs around in a circle. This time he's out looking for his niece, a young girl living with her step parents. Can Donald finally put Michael down for good? Judging by the films that came out after this one, probably not.Michael's niece is generally looked after by her step sister, some teenage girl with a boyfriend who's also caught the eye of the local sheriff's daughter. Michael this time escapes from an ambulance, killing at least six people by the time he comes home. He's on the hunt for his niece (she's out trick or treating with her stepsister) which leads to a showdown at the sheriff's house, with loads of locals out on the warpath for Michael's head. What's a poor misunderstood serial killer to do? Expect more of the same from the first two films, with a bit more involvement from Donald Pleasance, and more indestructible killing machine action from Michael. Not much more to say about this one – I was all burned out on Myers by the end and decided to watch Part 5 at a later date. It's a fairly decent slasher film. No more. No less.",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
65,Polaris_DiB,"Back to form, but slipping in interest",4,3 May 2007,"Ten years after the second movie ended, Michael has survived the explosion, Dr. Loomis is still trying to get people to fear Michael, and Jamie Lee Curtis' character has disappeared, leaving a child behind. Michael, of course, escapes, and somehow uses his preternatural knowledge of who's related to him to hunt down the little daughter and try to kill her. At this point what Michael hopes to achieve in killing specifically members of his family is starting to be kind of confusing, and it's questionable whether or not it really wouldn't be worth it to just give him his family to his morbid delight and save all of the victims that get in his path. But why think like that, when this is a slasher flick through and through? The point is to up the body count.I have to say this movie does a good job of keeping up with all of the plot elements of the first and second movies (and completely ignoring the extraneous third). It's refreshing after the third, especially because it makes the series seem to have a lot of respect for itself.On the other hand, ""Halloween 4"" itself doesn't really seem to know what exactly it wants to do. At one point during the movie it seems like it's going to become a survival thriller in the vein of a Romero zombie flick. Then it seems like it'll be more of an action film what with the loading up of the posse. Later it seems like it's leading into militarism as the characters rush to an outpost to defend themselves from this supernatural attacker. However, none of these threads are fully realized and the characters seem unable to just sit down and bide their time. They get up and wander around for no reason, they run in ridiculous and unproductive directions, and none of them seem able of getting an ounce of communication out.Donald Pleasence at this point looks tired of his character and bored. Michael is still delightful, but the rest of the characters are stock slasher fare. This may be an interesting movie for fans of the series, but it's not really good or bad enough to be noteworthy to anybody else.--PolarisDiB",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers

Michael survives and heads back to Haddonfield, embarking on another killing spree. This time, however, there is no sister Laurie Strode (played in parts 1 & 2 by Jamie Lee Curtis) but instead her daughter, well played by a very young Danielle Harris, who is his target.
This film is pretty far fetched at times - Michael has learnt to drive, has developed superhuman powers, etc - but it is well paced, has a good body count, some nice touches such as some Halloweeners dressed up as The Shape, and a shocking ending (which I won't reveal). Fairly low on gore, so no cuts required by the MPAA or BBFC. This is one of the better films in the series but not on par with parts 1 or 2.

68,NateWatchesCoolMovies,The return of Michael,7,21 November 2015,"After the unwelcome weirdness that was Halloween III, the restless fans screamed for Michael's return. Nearly a decade since he last showed his face, we are presented a different sort of Haddonfield, one living with the stigma of the Myers legacy. Now elderly Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasence) is nervously overseeing the transport of a comatose Michael Myers, when of course he wakes up, kills everyone in the van, somehow gets a mask that looks annoyingly not quite like his mask should (more on that later) and heads straight back to home sweet home, this time hunting the young daughter (an excellent Danielle Harris, carrying the film uncannily well for so young a girl) of Laurie Strode, named Jamie Lloyd. High schoolers Rachel Carruthers (Ellie Cornell) and Sasha Jenson from Dazed Confused get in Michael's way and are put in the splatter zone. Now about Michael's mask: For some reason the filmmakers couldn't remember, or didn't put the effort in to get the original mask, so we get this lopsided pasty thing that makes poor Mikey look like he has down syndrome or something. It doesn't hurt the movie too much though, we've come to see a halloween flick, which is what we ultimately get and no silly mask is gonna spoil that...but man it looks hurtin. This one has a nicely menacing opening credit sequence that really sets a festive tone in the halloween spirit. Like I said before, young star Danielle Harris (who appears later in Rob Zombie's awesome remakes) really holds the film together with her genuinely believable persona.

69,drownnnsoda,Great Comeback From The Dreadful Part III.,8,30 May 2006,"""Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers"" is a huge improvement from the unrelated crapfest sequel ""Halloween III: Season of the Witch"". ""Halloween 4"" starts off with Jamie Lloyd, who is incidentally Laurie Strode's daughter. With Laurie assumed dead, Jamie lives with her foster family, and her older foster-sister, Rachel. On Halloween, Jamie is ridiculed at school for her uncle being the ""boogeyman"", and Jamie decides that she wants to go trick-or-treating this year... But little does she know, Michael is back, with Dr. Loomis hot on his tracks. As Rachel takes Jamie out for a simple night of Halloween fun, it quickly turns to a night of horror when Michael begins to kill off people one by one, with Jamie as his main target.This was a really great horror flick, and I was glad to see Michael back after the strangely misplaced ""Halloween 3"". It had some truly great moments, and I enjoyed seeing good old Michael back with his trusty butcher knife. The story basically follows up later on after the events of the first and second films, and ties up loose ends well. Donald Pleasance is great as always as Dr. Loomis, and Danielle Harris played the part of the innocent Jamie really well, as did Ellie Cornell as her foster-sister Rachel. There were some great chase sequences (including the roof-chase), and the ending was shocking and completely unexpected.To sum it up, ""Halloween 4"" is a probably the second best sequel in the series, and is much better than the sequel that came before it.

72,JoeKarlosi,Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers (1988) **1/2,6,6 September 2007,"This will become confusing as I go on, but this film actually occurs after HALLOWEEN II. You have to consider this entry in the HALLOWEEN franchise as a crossroads; when watching all of the original Michael Myers ""Halloween"" movies in proper sequence, a decision as to what road you're going to take is in order at this stage because two different story lines begin. First we had HALLOWEEN and HALLOWEEN II (part III doesn't count because it didn't feature Myers), and here with HALLOWEEN 4 we get back on track with our white-masked maniac, only it's like hitting a fork in a road where, if you bear to the left, the series can continue differently with HALLOWEEN: H20 TWENTY YEARS LATER (aka Part 7) and HALLOWEEN RESURRECTION (aka Part 8)... but if you venture to the right, then you might resume right here with parts 4, 5, and 6 - which is another story arc entirely! So when we last left Michael and his psychiatrist Dr. Loomis in PART II, both were blown to smithereens. This chapter starts off 10 years later where the charred but comatose Myers is getting transferred to another hospital again (and right before Halloween Night, no less!) but he manages to escape and heads back to his usual stomping grounds in Haddonfield, Illinois. Jamie Lee Curtis' character of Laurie Strode has been written out as having died, but she leaves behind a little girl named Jamie (played by 10-year-old Danielle Harris) who is living with a foster family, and suffering from nightmares featuring her infamous uncle, the boogeyman. Her foster sister Rachel (Ellie Cornell) has to give up a special date with her boyfriend to babysit for Jamie on Halloween, but it will be more rough than she thought because the stalking Michael Myers has set his sights on killing his niece that evening. Suffering a slight burn on his right cheek and now hobbling about with a cane since the fiery explosion, Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasence) rants and raves as he gets back on Myers' trail to try and once more save the day.The physical return of Michael Myers is welcome, and enough time and miserable sequels have now passed since this film was first released in 1988 to consider it pretty good, if not anything exceptional. Director Dwight D. Little succeeds at capturing some atmosphere in his dark and misty night shots, and Pleasence has reached the point where he has completely gotten into his character of Loomis and he's a lot of fun to watch. The action starts right away and things move along pretty briskly until around the midway point, at which time we get bogged down with some padding in the scenes inside the local sheriff's house. There are also massive plot holes and contrivances to be sure, but young newcomer Danielle Harris (who turned 11 during shooting) is quite good in her film debut (she would return for next year's Part 5) as is Cornell, playing her big sister. These two make a good team. I don't know what happened to Michael's classic mask from the first two films; the new one he wears this time is strictly of the dime store variety. HALLOWEEN 4 closes with a pretty chilling final shot (which I won't reveal) that sets the stage to lure prospective ticket buyers into the next of Michael's never-ending adventures. **1/2 out of ****",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers

However, it suffers from the major problem that it has pretty much exactly the same story as parts 1 and 2, only that there's no Jamie Lee Curtis and a lot less suspense. After the third part, ""Season of the Witch"", had no Michael Myers in it and flopped, the producers decided to bring Michael back in. So this film is simply more of the exact same, which, kindly stated, becomes slightly unoriginal after some time.After ten years in a high security prison for dangerous mental screwups, Michael gets transferred to another prison and - Surprise! - he escapes, killing all his guards on the way. He wastes no time and hurries to Haddonfield, where the little daughter of his sister Laurie Strode is waiting to be terrorized by uncle Mike... Luckily, good old Dr. Sam Loomis has seen it all coming, and is also on his way to Haddonfield...As mentioned above, ""The Return of Michael Myers"" has little new to offer. The majority of late 80s slashers were blatant imitations of ""Halloween"" and ""Friday the 13th"", but they usually made up in gore for what they lacked in originality. Since this film was intended for wider mainstream audiences, however, it isn't even really gory. Heck, a large part of the murders in this one are not even seen, as they take part off-screen, and those that are seen are scandalously un-bloody. The film does have some positive aspects though, the most welcome being the return of the great Donald Pleasence in the role of Dr. Sam Loomis. Pleasence is great as always, but that doesn't change that he does exactly the same things as in parts 1 and 2. Michael is still a menacing villain, but then, he does nothing that he didn't already do in a scarier manner in parts 1 and 2. Ellie Connel, who plays the teenage victim protagonist isn't bad, but she hardly is a replacement for Jamie Lee Curtis. One very welcome new face is then 10-year old Danielle Harris, who is very likable and cute in the role of little Jamie Lloyd, a character it is easy to be scared for. Furthermore, John Carpenter's brilliant original theme tune simply never gets old.""The Return of Michael Myers"" isn't a terrible failure; it isn't even really a bad film, but it suffers from being nothing but a duller, less suspenseful copy of its predecessors. John Carpenters original ""Halloween"" of 1978 is a classic and absolute must-see, of course, and ""Halloween II"" of 1981 is incredibly suspenseful and doubtlessly also a must-see for every Horror fan. All other sequels may be seen or skipped, in my opinion. ""Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers"" maybe could have been more entertaining with more gore and brutality, but sadly it is overall pretty dull.",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
75,aidanratesmovies,Quite Ridiculous,3,5 July 2021,"A completely useless entry into a strung out franchise- Halloween 4 is a complete mess of familiar tropes and cliches, without having any memorability of the previous films. Although I did hate a lot about this film, there a few decent things about it. The acting surprisingly isn't half bad, occasionally a few actors will be a bit over the top, but for the most part the cast is pretty solid for their roles- even if they are written at times quite poorly. The pacing is much better than in the last Michael Myers centered film, although its tedious and predictable natures hardly save it from still being a dull mess. The cinematography isn't half bad- but seems largely in imitation of the original- and it's hardly interesting enough to keep viewers from losing attention on the screen. So what is so bad about this sequel you may ask? Unfortunately it's just about the most mechanically moving film I have seen in quite some time. Not to mention you can predict pretty much the entire film from the get-go, the film follows nearly a step for step formula based on the original on how to make this film, and it results in something so utterly bland it's honestly laughable at times. Besides this, there are many other laughable moments throughout, mainly through the films plot holes, randomness, and derailed sense of logic- which I guess isn't unusual for a horror sequel- but boy is it obvious. In the end, Halloween 4 is not a disaster per say, but just a forgettable and bland nightmare that just isn't worth the time- nor the money many may pay to watch it.My Rating: 3.2/10.",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers

77,Reviews_of_the_Dead,"Decent Enough Continuation to the Story, if you Overlook Plot-Holes",7,21 January 2021,"This is a movie that I don't actually remember the first time I saw it. I know that I would have seen it a lot when it would come on the AMC FrightFest for October so it is one I've seen quite a bit. I'm not even sure if I saw the original before this one or not. Regardless, I know I picked up the DVD while I was in college, but I probably hadn't seen it in some time. I'm now giving it another viewing as I'm discussing it on the Podcast Under the Stairs. The synopsis here is ten years after his original massacre, the invalid Michael Myers (George P. Wilbur) awakens on Halloween Eve and returns to Haddonfield to kill his seven-year-old niece. Can Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasence) stop him?For this movie, we start on October 30th, 1988. An ambulance goes to a state-run sanitarium where they're keeping Michael Myers. This is picking up as the synopsis states, ten years after the first two movies. The movie is a bit unrealistic as to what happens at the end of 2 with Michael and Dr. Loomis, but I digress. Two attendants are there to collect Michael. They're running late due to the heavy storm and the doctor in charge, Dr. Hoffman (Michael Pataki), is ready to be rid of this patient. The attendants ask about Dr. Loomis and we get the idea that he's not well liked and hoping with Michael gone, he will retire. They hit the road and bring up that Michael has a niece. He kills the attendants, causing a car accident.We then shift over to Haddonfield on Halloween. Jamie Lloyd (Danielle Harris) is the niece of Michael. Her mother was Laurie Strode and this poor girl is an orphan after her parents died in a car accident. When we first get to meet Jamie, she is having trouble sleeping and thinks she sees an ambulance and Michael outside. Her adopted sister, Rachel Carruthers (Ellie Cornell) convinces her to go to bed where she has a nightmare.The next morning is an interesting interaction where Darlene (Karen Alston) informs her daughter Rachel that she is going to have to babysit when the other cancels. She isn't happy about this as she has a date that night with Brady (Sasha Jenson). She is carrying on and Jamie unfortunately hears. This causes her to feel horrible for being a pain to which Rachel does what she can to cheer her up. Jamie has it rough in that she is also bullied at school due to who her uncle is.Dr. Loomis comes into work to find out that Michael was moved the previous night. He's not shocked to hear about the accident and he goes on a hunt to find him. This leads to a gas station where Michael kills the mechanic and the other people working. He takes a jumpsuit and when Dr. Loomis shows up, leaves the place in a state of mayhem. Dr. Loomis has to hitchhike in order to get to Haddonfield where he meets with the new sheriff, Ben Meeker (Beau Starr).It doesn't take long for Michael to start killing as he looks for his niece. Sheriff Meeker calls for a curfew which upsets some men in the town. They create a posse looking for Michael as well. Jamie gets separated from Rachel while they're out and there's also a weird interest that the younger girl has in her choice of costume. Can Jamie survive the night from her monstrous uncle and if she does, what will be left of her psyche?Now I'll admit I have a lot of nostalgia for this movie since I used to see it as much as I did. When I was younger, I really had a crush on Harris and I thought this is an interesting way to build back on the story with Michael Myers. Being a little bit older, I can see that this one is really borrowing heavy from the original. We have him making his escape from a mental hospital, making his way to Haddonfield, being hunted by Dr. Loomis, being obsessed with hunting a specific individual and then our characters making a stand. There are some similar deaths here as well. That's not to say though that I hated this and I mean this is following a similar formula of a lot of slashers as well.Having now watched the original quite a few times, I don't necessarily need the angle of Michael being related to Laurie or Jamie. Since I grew up so long with it, I do still have that soft spot for it. It is scarier though with this guy just being a psycho who is going around killing people on Halloween. There is still something though to that fact that at this time, he just has an insatiable need to kill his family as he is just pure evil.I don't know if the character of Dr. Loomis works as well here. The burn on his face doesn't necessarily match up to what we saw in Halloween 2. If I'm going to ignore that, I do think that Pleasence does well at showing someone who has descended into madness. Now that I really think of it, there's an interesting duality here between him and Michael. His obsession is this patient that until he dies, he will never be able to not worry where all Michael wants to do is kill Jamie. I do love his meltdown at the end of the movie as well.Before moving on to other aspects of the movie, I want to bring up the mob and their mentality. Sheriff Meeker is told by Dr. Loomis that Michael is back. It is interesting that he believes him and he immediately puts in effect a curfew. Currently living in this pandemic for COVID is interesting, because Earl (Gene Ross) who owns a local bar tries to call the police. When he can't get through, he rounds up his guys to go down there to see what is going on. The reason this really resonances is that this is exactly what happened when the economy had to be shut down. We also see what happens when you let people like this lot run rampant with their guns.Where I want to take this next is the acting. I've already said my piece on Pleasence. I like Cornell. She is cute and plays this typical high school girl well. She is worried about if she doesn't go out with her boyfriend, what he might do. There is of course much more to life, but for someone her age, there isn't. Harris is also adorable in this movie and I just feel bad for her. There's a lot going on with her that someone her age should have to deal with. She isn't great, but I believe her. Wilbur is fine body wise as Michael. I do like Starr as the new sheriff. I would also say that the rest of the cast rounds this out for what was needed, even though it would be nice to have seen Kathleen Kinmont completely topless.Next I'll take this to the effects. This movie is a bit more brutal than I remember. It fits well into the latter half of the slasher boom. It is interesting as it came out at a time where we were getting more comedy in these types of movies. What I did notice is that we could get to see the deaths, but they would cut away without going gory. I'm assuming this was in part due to censorship. To be honest though, it was fine. We get some interesting deaths regardless. I don't care for the mask though for Michael. That was really a step back from the previous two movies with him. I also have an inkling the scar on Loomis' face is inconsistent and even switches cheeks at different times. Aside from that though, I'd say the cinematography was fine.The last thing to go over would be the soundtrack. I have to give credit that they kept the main Halloween theme that John Carpenter did. This one you can tell he didn't score outside of that. It does look like Alan Howarth did the music for this one though. It isn't as iconic, but I'd say that he did good with the rest of the score fitting for what was needed.So now with that said, this movie is of course not as good as I remember it as a child. It also isn't as bad as I was expecting now watching it with a critical eye. I can see its flaws, but I still enjoyed it as a latter slasher and fine as sequel to a classic. Not all of the story elements work and I don't necessarily need the family angle. Since we are getting, I will say that I'm fine where it goes. The ending does leave them open for a sequel, which we all know did come. The acting was solid. The effects are interesting since we cut away before we get the gore, but I think what we get leading up to them does well enough. Soundtrack isn't as iconic while still working. Overall I'd say this is an above average movie that although isn't great, is still good time.",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
78,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,"You'd think it would be better than Halloween III: Season of the Witch (1982),...but it wasn't much better",5,1 August 2015,"For obvious reasons, even for people who are not that familiar with the franchise, could understand fairly quickly why the title to this entry says ""The Return of Michael Myers"". After Halloween III: Season of the Witch (1982) failed to impress critics and fans alike, the only way to make the series a lucrative franchise again would be to somehow bring back the silent, creepy stalker, kitchen knife wielding Michael Myers from Halloween (1978) and Halloween II (1981). It's really too bad actually. Although its writing contained bigger flaws than usual like weak characterizations and clear as day plot holes, it still had a respectable cast, acceptable special effects and haunting music. The idea of creating a new film revolving around the holiday of Halloween felt like a better way for filmmakers to be creative in their horror films. However, thanks to the poor marketing, the idea was scrapped and now filmmakers had to be even more creative on how to make Michael Myers continue to revolve around the holiday. There's only so much you can do before you start beating a dead horse.Ignoring the events of Halloween III: Season of the Witch (1982), this installment takes place identically as its release date - 10 years after the events of Halloween (1978) and Halloween II (1981). Initially being transferred to another location, burn victim Michael Myers (George P. Wilbur) escapes hospital custody and heads back to Haddonfield to kill Laurie Strode's daughter Jamie Lloyd (Danielle Harris) who's being fostered by Rachel Carruthers (Ellie Cornell). Hoping the events from before does not happen again, Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasence) who teams up with Sheriff Ben Meeker (Beau Starr) follow close behind. Considering the circumstances the premise isn't half-bad, but when questions begin to arise, fans will not get their entire fill. Throughout the film, several questions are asked but very few reasons of clarification are given. The best example is that Dr. Loomis knows that Myers wants to kill Jamie, but Meeker asks how is it possible if Jamie wasn't even born when the events of Halloween (1978) and Halloween II (1981) occurred? The answer is never given. Another question is how'd Myers and Loomis survive the explosion of Halloween II (1981)? And didn't Myers have his eyes shot out? So how is it that he can see now? The screenplay by first time writer (at the time) Alan B. McElroy seems to lack the clarity of effective and coherent storytelling. Thankfully even with the sloppy writing, the acting and characters are still effective. All main actors on screen act the way they should for the predicaments they're put into. The best actor (of course) is Donald Pleasence for his persistence on attempting to take down Myers even while not being in the best of conditions. The second best actor goes to Danielle Harris for being so convincing in her role at such a young age. It's not easy to find a child actor who knows what to do for every scene and Harris nails it. As for the character of Michael Myers played by stunt man George P. Wilbur, it actually feels like there's less of a personality this time. As much as the title to this revisiting claims it is the ""return"" of Mike, Myers isn't on screen very much.Believe it or not in fact his presence feels less used than that of the first two films. There's no head tilts or other subtle movements that help define Mike. Yet it's also confusing because as much as the audience doesn't always see Myers, for every scene it seems as if he's always around. How can he be in more than one place at the same time? If that's not the case, then how does he casually walk between destinations that feel miles apart with a couple minutes? Again, no explanations. Is the violence acceptable - yes. Does it entertain - ehhh,...its something to watch so yeah, but at most minimal level. There are some kills that are performed a tad differently from other films, which involves twisting but it's not that graphic or different in style from other kills. Director Dwight H. Little seemed like he went with the flow when it came to how he wanted certain things done. The execution works but doesn't have the same spine-tingling atmosphere the first two films had down so well.Behind the camera was Peter Lyons Collister as the director of photography. Although not every scene had landscape shots and was instead used with several POV shots, there were a couple times Collister impressed. The most effective parts of Collister's work were when the camera actually focused in on Michael Myers. As much as zooming in can be distracting, Collister uses it just enough to give the viewer some goosebumps when Michael Myers steps into focus. It is a bit unsettling. The film score produced by returning composer Alan Howarth is rather disappointing. Taking into account that Howarth worked on the recognizable music since Halloween II (1981), it's jarring when nothing new is added to such a memorable score. Yes Howarth keeps the original Halloween (1978) theme and that's important but nothing else is done. There are no new motifs or creepy cues to hear in this score. A lot of it is either absent or atmospheric, which is okay to a point but not very memorable in most cases.It has a decent cast that can act well, standard cinematography and violence but that doesn't make it much better than Halloween III: Season of the Witch (1982). Its music feels underdeveloped, Michael Myers feels barely present and the continuation of the story doesn't exactly make a whole lot of sense when all the facts are laid out in plain sight.",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
79,alexanderdavies-99382,"The ""Halloween"" franchise returning to its roots.",7,7 September 2017,"After the interesting misfire that was ""Halloween 3: Season of the Witch,"" the producer decided it was time to return the ""Halloween"" franchise to its roots. Released in 1988, the above film succeeds in doing just that and is a worthy sequel to the previous films with the Michael Myers character. Also returning was Donald Pleasence as Dr. Sam Loomis. The ""Halloween"" films just wouldn't be the same without him, he plays a considerable role in giving these movies their cult status. It is now nearly Halloween once more. Ten years have elapsed since the time when crazed killer Michael Myers attempted to kill his sister Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis). Both he and Sam Loomis were assumed to have died in the fire at the end of ""Halloween 2."" Loomis is now facially scarred and walks with a stick. Myers is in a comatose state at the beginning of the film. He is now subject to Federal law and is due to be tried if he should regain consciousness. As is to be expected, Myers is roused from his dormant state and embarks upon his latest rampage of murder. He is making his way back to Haddonfield so he can murder his niece, Jamie (Danielle Harris). Hot on his trail is Loomis who needs to convince the police that the tragedies of before might occur again. It is a race against time for Loomis in attempting to protect Jamie from her psychopathic uncle. The pace never lets up and there are some eerie and effective scenes. The plot is kept quite streamlined which is good. As soon as darkness descends, the danger is upon the town and upon Jamie. Quite a number of people are killed and Myers shows no mercy toward them. With Loomis, he makes an exception. He has a few opportunities to kill him but for some reason, he doesn't. Myers hurts Loomis for sure but never uses much force in finishing him. Could it be that he has a speck of human feeling for his former Doctor? I was a bit disappointed with how Michael Myers looks in this film. The mask he wears, is nowhere near as frightening as in the first film. In the 1978 movie, I thought I was gazing upon a mask where the eyes looked like two dark,bottomless pits. In this movie, the mask looks like something out of a children's toy store. He didn't look physically imposing enough as before either. Even so, it is something I can overlook. The dialogue is actually quite good for a film of this kind. Every scene refers to the plot in some way. Acting honours go to Donald Pleasence and Danielle Harris. They only one proper scene together but it is an effective one. Harris gives her character a lot of depth and conviction, especially when she is made all to aware of her situation. The ending includes a suitably shocking twist, I shalln't say what it is. ""Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers"" helps to maintain the style of the first two films well. It isn't surprising that a fifth ""Halloween"" film was commissioned as the fourth one was being made.",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers

Unfortunately, that is the best part of this movie, because after dramatically changing the ending of part II, the rest of it is only a veritable remake of part one: the masked killer comes out of a coma and returns to his hometown, on the hyperbolic ""ten years anniversary,"" to stalk more prey, specifically, his young niece.Routine, formulaic '80s slasher, with some occasional outbursts of out-of-place gore, and highly implausible: they waited to transport a mass murderer until the ten years anniversary of his crimes, during a pouring down rainstorm, AFTER mentioning a family member he never knew about, thus giving him another target? The Shape also felt compelled to randomly visit a power plant, to kill a worker, and knock out the power to the entire city, sending it into clichéd darkness? As I said, formulaic in the extreme.The producers decided to bring Myers back for this one, after part III received a less than stellar response, but the $17 million this movie made was only slightly better than its predecessor's $13 million.Film includes too much teenage melodrama; alternate title could be ""The Haddonfield Chronicles.""",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers

Tonight HE'S BACK!,5,2 November 2009,"This fourth installment of the series takes place ten years after the original and finds Michael Myers in a coma and being transferred from Richmond Mental Institute to Smith's Grove. However, the van gets into a horrible accident, skidding off the road and exploding. Predictably, Myers' body is nowhere to be found in the wreckage, alarming both the skeptical police and the indefatigable Dr. Loomis. Soon, Myers is spotted back in Haddonfield, and it becomes obvious that his next target is his young niece, Jamie.Let me start off by saying this: I have not seen the sequel to the original film but I have seen the original film (who hasn't). I didn't really know what to expect because I just saw this film out of spontaneity and I was interested because Danielle Harris was in here, who was in the remake of HALLOWEEN. I didn't expect much and I got just that. Being the fourth film in the ever-so-popular franchise, HALLOWEEN 4 is better than most franchises would be in their fourth film and I'd expect it being a huge step up after HALLOWEEN 3. However, that's not saying much.Instead of Laurie Strode returning, we get her daughter. Now, this news may seem like the final nail to the coffin of the franchise, having a kid be in a starring role for such a popular franchise. Fortunately, however, Danielle Harris is not bad. In fact, she isn't that bad at all. She seems very mature for her age and you can tell by her performance. Ellie Cornell also did a good job in her role next to Harris. I can't say much for Donald Pleasence, though. I think he's getting tired in his role and if not, he should be.As for the movie itself, it just moves in a slow pace with a ho-hum feeling throughout. The kill scenes aren't really spectacular nor are the chase scenes thrilling. The final showdown isn't much to brag about either. The movie plays it extremely safe, I'm surprised to say. However, the last shot of the film is truly surprising and leaves a great cliffhanger for the next sequel, which I will write about very soon. I wish the whole movie were like the last shot.I really have nothing else to say about the film. Although carried by strong, young actors and ending in something unpredictable and eerie, HALLOWEEN 4 is really nothing to scream about. It plays it safe through and through and never really reaches its full potential to discover some new directions for the series to take.

85,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"While far from the series best, ""Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers"" is a mildly entertaining bit of dumb-fun, and a decent-enough slasher-sequel.",6,1 January 2015,"You know you aren't exactly in for high-art when a film begins with fairly messy piece of ret-con work to try and justify its own existence. In this case, a bit of contrived dialog aiming to explain how the infamous Michael Myers (and his psychologist Sam Loomis, played wonderfully by Donald Pleasence) was able to survive his seemingly obvious fiery demise at the end of his last outing.But then again, most audiences will likely know what they're in for, and won't be too bothered by this detail, nor by the myriad of other issues and inconsistencies present in the film. No, by this point we know the ""Halloween"" series, which began with the iconic (and quite excellent) John Carpenter original has pretty much degenerated into little more than admittedly above-average but still by-the-numbers slasher fare. Directed by Dwight Little (who also helmed the surprisingly entertaining '89 ""Phantom of the Opera"" and some genuinely good TV- work), the film does have some strength to it, mainly in the quieter, darker moments when the film isn't going full ""slasher"" mode.And in that respect ""Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers"" is a fairly entertaining and occasionally frightening bit of horror-fun, even though it obviously never is able to reach the great heights of other installments.This installment follows Jamie (Danielle Harris), Michael's young niece, as she and her foster sister (along with other canon-fodder characters) are terrorized by her sadistic uncle after he escapes from his confinement locked-up in a hospital. But they aren't alone, for the obsessive Dr. Sam Loomis is hot on his tail, with the aid of the local sheriff. (Beau Starr) We even get an amusing sub-plot thrown in revolving around a group of drunken, gun- toting red-necks who form their own sort-of lynch-mob, and are trying to track down and kill Michael themselves. (Leading to some genuinely disturbing-yet-darkly-hilarious moments where their ""shoot first and ask questions later"" attitude causes some... mistakes.)The film actually does have quite a bit going for it. At least when it isn't going full-blown ""slasher film"", which it unfortunately does much of the time. In the quieter moments, director Little is able to deliver some genuinely creepy moments with good-ole Michael, courtesy some expert visual storytelling and good composition. The film is also briskly paced and has a good narrative flow, even when dialog and characterization borders on paper-thin. And the film is even deliver some good quirky, funny moments, which is a nice change-up for the series. (Aforementioned red-necks being one example. Another being an amusing scene of Loomis interacting with a drunken priest.)And I will admit, that despite obviously being little more than standard slasher-film material, the film does have an admirable bit of restraint in not showing TOO much gore, in addition to a few clever beats of writing- particularly for the Loomis character.However, that being said, this film still does fall prey too often to the clichés of slasher-horror. There are just a few too many scenes of people stumbling onto corpses before suddenly being killed themselves. A few too many jump-scares. A few too many needlessly gross on-screen deaths. It does bring the film down a few points, because even at the time this film was released- it was played out and cheap. And it does make the film pale in comparison to the prior Michael-centric entries.That being said, I still think this is worth checking out for slasher fans and definitely worth a shot for fans of the original film. It's not great, but it's enough fun to hold your attention for 90 minutes.I give it an about-average 6 out of 10.",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers

He's only ever in the one scene we've all seen a million times, where he picks up a desperate Loomis off the side of the highway and gives him a ride. From the first time I saw that scene, I always hoped he'd show back up -- if not in this film, then the future ones. Unfortunately, that's not the case. Apparently Nicholas Grabowsky, who wrote the novelization of Halloween IV, also enjoyed the character of Sayer, because he wrote a couple more scenes including said quirky Reverend.Anyway, I may write a more in-depth review for this one some other time, but I just felt compelled to share a few thoughts about Sayer before I start cooking dinner.",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
88,Pumpkin_Man,Michael Myers is Back With a Vengeance!!!,10,21 February 2017,"This sequel returns to the basics of the Halloween series. Everybody cried that Michael was gone, so they brought him back. Six years after Dr. Challis stopped Cochran and the evil Silver Shamrock masks, we return to Michael Myers, who has been in a coma ever since the fire in the hospital. While being transferred, he overhears that Laurie Strode had a daughter named Jamie Lloyd, so he awakens and goes back to Haddonfield and tries to kill her. Hot on his trail is Dr. Loomis, who also survived the explosion in the hospital. Jamie has been adopted by the Carruthers family and must be protected by Rachel. On Halloween night, Jamie and Rachel are trapped inside the Sheriff's house with Michael locked in. This movie has some beautiful Autumn scenery. If you love the series, you'll definitely enjoy HALLOWEEN 4: THE RETURN OF MICHAEL MYERS!!!",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
89,baumer,I was aching for a sequel....,8,20 July 1999,"When I heard that Halloween was about to spawn yet another sequel, my first question was, can they at least try to make is scary?  I had been through all the crappy Friday sequels ( 7,8,9 ) and the bad bad bad Nightmare sequels.  I know that there will probably never be a film that has the same effect that the original did but I could still hope for some effort.  So I eagerly ventured to the theater and bought my ticket, got my M&M's and pop and sat down in the almost full theater and waited.  The films starts off quite well.  It's a stormy night, a van is travelling what looks to be a desolate road to what looks to be a hellish place.  Inside we hear some good lines like "" Jesus has nothing to do with this place lady, "" and then we see him.  Good old Michael Myers.  The two attendants ship him out and it is then that we learn that it is October 30th of all nights.  Another good set piece.  So the film is moving along quite nicely at this point.  We have the stormy night, the folklore of Devils Night and two attendants that you know are going to die soon enough.  And then, it happens.  THE MUSIC. Carpenter's famous haunting music blares eerily on the soundtrack, and that did it for me.  I was under the spell.  I was ready for another Halloween. Halloween 4 is a good film.  It is honest in its effort to pay homage to what made Halloween so popular.  The beginning is a great way to get back into the game ten years after the first graced our screen.  After the beginning the film succeeds very well.  It is not as good as the first or even the second but it does try.  Dwight H. Little probably studied the first and tried to emulate what made it so scary because he has some similar atmosphere in here, especially in the scene where Jamie is dreaming, and my favourite scene is when the sheriff's daughter tries talking to the deputy in the chair.  What appears mystically like a ghost right out of the depths of nothingness is truly what Halloween has been known for.  That one shot alone had me more frightened than almost any shot from any horror film in the 80's, save for Nightmare On Elm Street.  The story has Michael returning to Haddonfield to hunt down his niece. There are some obvious plot holes, like how he got his sight back, but that is easily overlooked, after all, this is a horror movie.  So he returns and against everyones best judgement Dr. Loomis comes after him.  Loomis is massively scarred from the second one when he should have been dead from the fire, but again, that is acceptable, after all this is a horror film.  So he comes to Haddonfield again and he warns everyone that HE is on is way.  This time the sherriff actually believes him and they vow to search for the monster before he kills anyone.  We all know that is going to be futile. 
The reason this film works is because it has atmosphere.  Again, there is not a lot of gore in here but what it does have is some good scares.  It keeps you on your toes and if you pay attention to some of the shots and some of the symbolism, you will  predict the end.  That is only if you pay attention.But one downer and that is that it isn't the original.  As good as it is, it just can't be as good as the first or even the second.  And I think I might know what it is that prevents horror films from being as good as they were. 70's and 80's films look like they are 70's and 80's films.  They have that slight fuzz to them.  And that adds to the dimension of fear.  I think that if directors could somehow use a different filter or lens or whatever it is that they can use to make it look older, then they would have that desired effect.  Kubrick did it with Eyes Wide Shut, other film makers should take note.All in all this is a great sequel.  It is a good entry in the series and an honest effort to make it scary.  It is quite spooky in many parts, but it just lacks something.....  But still quite good and worth a look, especially on a rainy night when you are alone.  When you hear that music......",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
90,DunnDeeDaGreat,Allright sequel,7,13 July 2002,Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers is a decent sequel to the horror series.

92,gedikreverdi,A really spooky sequel,8,21 September 2021,"It's very good to give it a watch at this time of the year. It exceeded my expectations and it's definitely my favorite installment of the franchise so far. Laurie's daughter lives with her relatives and Rachel. It's Halloween and Michael escapes while he's being transformed from the sanitarium. He's burned just like Loomis. They all took refuge at the sheriff's house and it was really spooky. The silhouette by the window up in the attic reminded me of Black Christmas. He butchered all of them in the house. They locked themselves in at the sheriff's house so Rachel and Laurie's daughter got up on the roof. The roof scene was really good. The locals that formed a lynch mob took them away from the town but he was on the truck too. He killed them with his bare hands and Rachel ran over him and as usual they shot him countless times. The ground collapsed and he fell down the hole.The twist at the end was so unexpected. Laurie's daughter killed his aunt with her mask and clown costume on. She had touched Michael's hand so she probably got a piece of his murderous soul.Even though it's without Jamie Lee Curtis, I really enjoyed it and find it really spooky. It's definitely my favorite among the first 4 installments.",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
93,mentalcritic,Michael Myers is back... now can he please go away again?,1,24 October 2004,"Sixteen years and four sequels later, with a fifth apparently on the table, Halloween 4 has a similar nostalgic impact nowadays as Police Academy 2. Because the previous episode in the franchise bombed at the box office, the decision was made at this point to make all future sequels to the same formula as one of the first two films in the canon. Unfortunately, they chose to base Halloween 4 upon the second, formulaic episode. Or at least, that's the impression one gets from the story, which is so basic I am surprised anyone is credited with writing it.According to trivia, inserts were filmed after principal photography in order to increase the blood and gore factor of this episode. The problem with this is that even with these inserts, there is precious little blood in the film. I can only recall one sequence in which anything resembling blood is even in front of the camera, if that. I'd therefore hate to see what kind of cut the director originally had in mind.All kidding aside, the original Halloween did not need to rely upon gore to catch the viewer's attention. Instead, it created a cast of characters that the viewer could have an emotional investment in, and an atmosphere to go with them. Halloween 4 brings us new characters, and Jamie Lloyd notwithstanding, few of them are even interesting. The mysterious long-lost relative plot device, so ruthlessly murdered by its overuse to justify so many lame horror sequels, gets dragged out one more time here. When one looks at the producer's output to date, it becomes obvious that there are so many Halloween sequels because said producer cannot create anything else.Donald Pleasance gets another turn in a role I'm sure he wishes he'd never taken. With Jamie Lee Curtis' absence from the film, he is pretty much the only actor in this episode who has appeared in anything of substance. Given that the script gives him sod all to do, it makes one wonder exactly why he bothered to appear in two other sequels. Then again, after the overacting he puts on in the final twist sequence, I doubt that too many productions would be going out of their way to ask for his participation.In the end, Halloween 4 is a one out of ten film. It isn't bad enough to be good, it's merely bland enough to be horrible. Determined completists, fanatical fans of Michael Myers, and insomniacs only need apply.",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
94,mentalcritic,Halloween the 13th?,1,23 October 2004,"As I have said before, an astute critic once noted that the Friday The 13th series was the ultimate in recycling, so much so that one often had trouble telling which sequel they were watching after a while. The fact that Friday The 13th was basically plagiarized (and not very well at that) from Halloween didn't save the Halloween franchise from falling victim to the same repetition curse. It's somewhat ironic, and troubling, that the one Halloween sequel that dared to be different from episodes two, four, and the other four dozen, generally gets the harshest criticism.Halloween 4 picks up years after the end of Halloween II, a film that decided to follow an atmospheric original with a clichéd gorefest that is so devoid of impact it is a wonder the franchise has lasted at all. In a regurgitation of the anonymous-relative cliché that proves Moustapha Akkad was watching The Empire Strikes Back just a little too closely, we are told that Laurie Strode was killed in a car accident, but not before she gave birth to Jamie, who is played in this and the next episode by Danielle ""If I Only Had A Career"" Harris. Doctor Loomis is there, naturally, to give us his usual melodramatic spiel.According to something I just read, the makers of Halloween 4 felt that the finished film was too soft, and added some pickups to increase the gore factor. I must have blinked and missed these inserts, because in comparison to Halloween parts two and five, there is really very little to get carried away about here. Even the footage at the end of this episode is presented in a very tame fashion compared to when it appears in the next.A popular defence of Halloween 4 is that it at least has the titular Shatner-masked character in it. This, however, is a poor defense for formulaic dribble that brings nothing new to the genre. We keep hearing about how Michael escapes from this or that unnamed facility, and how he drives the requisite overnight drive to Haddonfield, are left to our imaginations. As in they show us absolutely nothing that gives us a clear idea of how Michael achieved these small goals. We're simply told Michael does these things, and expected to take it as read. Still, the things that we are being told aren't completely ludicrous, as happens in later sequels.I gave Halloween 4 a one out of ten. There are far better serial killer-based films out there. This one is only worth investigating if you're really bored.",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
95,Fernando-Rodrigues,Dr. Loomis alive?!,5,6 February 2021,"It's an overestimated comeback. It has several flaws, which make it a tepid film. Like: incoherences (literal empty streets on Halloween night), some weak actings, dumb decisions (why did Sam take Jamie to the school? the school alarm only attracted Michael.), and off-screen kills.",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
96,ODDBear,Second best in the series,8,30 August 2004,"This sequel to Halloween 2 is a welcome addition to the series after the horrible third installment. Michael Myers is back, and this time he wants to carve up Laurie Strode's little baby girl. But he can't get to her before dispatching a whole lot a people in Haddonfield.Director Dwight Little deserves a lot of credit here. For the most part he tries to create some genuine suspense and puts the accent mostly on atmosphere rather than blood and guts. In most respects he succeeds very well. The moody atmosphere is admirably sustained for most of the film's running time and reaches it's climax in a terrific scene inside the Haddonfield sheriff's house where Michael has silently invaded the house without anyone knowing. Using simple lighting effects to create the eerie mood, Halloween 4 most resembles John Carpenter's magnificent original than other films in the series. It's low budget origins do not show easily, the film simply designed as a seasonal cash in on the franchise, it's quite surprising to see the level of craftsmanship on display. Despite the good show of creepy atmosphere and eerie mood, the film has a spectacular edge-of-your-seat cliffhanger sequence where Michael terrorizes his victims on a roof.The familiar Halloween music score gets a reworked treatment in the hands of frequent Carpenter collaborator Alan Howarth and as in the first one the music greatly enhances the film's effectiveness. The final minutes are a bit of a letdown where poor editing and a rather unlikely scenario (even for a Halloween entry) wrap the film up, it was nearly perfect up until then. But Little throws in a surprise creepy ending which sadly was not realized better in subsequent sequels.",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
97,fmarkland32,Return to form...,7,7 November 2006,"As it turns out Michael Myers didn't die in the hospital all those years ago, rather he was just badly injured and when the hospital transfers Mysers, he springs his assault and sharpens his butcher knife on the same town he terrorized ten years earlier. When Halloween III tanked (Even though I thought it wasn't half bad) I was skeptical of them bringing back Michael Myers as it seemed like a cheap gimmick to try and sell tickets after losing ground against Friday The 13th and Nightmare On Elm Street, however I was wrong, Halloween 4 is a surprisingly inventive and suspenseful slasher pic that is extremely well made and directed very well by Dwight H. Little. Little manages to have a good eye for detail and his buildup while not as good as the first manages to thoroughly engross the viewer. Also the characters on hand are likable and there is ample opportunity for Donald Pleasance to steal the show and ham it up. The gore level isn't very high but Halloween 4 is easily the best sequel of the bunch.*** out of 4-(Good)",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
98,fernandoschiavi,"Halloween 4 gets back on track with the Michael Myers films, with characters known to fans and bringing a good mix between police chase, slasher and thriller",6,29 August 2021,"The title of the fourth part of the Halloween franchise is quite clear as to its objective. Michael Myers is back. After the classic directed by John Carpenter in 1978 and the competent part 2 of 1981, the series fell apart with the third film. Halloween 3, 1982, had an interesting script and good functional elements to the genre, but the figure of Michael Myers was sidelined in an attempt to take the series in a new direction. Despite being a good movie, fans didn't like the format and Halloween 3 almost buried the series.Realizing that the original work would celebrate 10 years, executive producer Moustapha Akkad conceived a fourth episode and decided to bring back the main elements responsible for the success of the first two films. To start with, we have the return of Michael Myers, this time played by George P. Wilbur. In the script, ten years have passed since the killing of movies 1 and 2, which take place on the same night. Michael survived the explosion in the hospital where much of the action in the second film takes place and has since remained in a catatonic state in a sanatorium. In addition to Michael's return, the fourth film also featured actor Donald Pleasence again, as the ever-changing Dr. Loomis, who also survived the explosion at the end of the second film. Without the return of Jamie Lee Curtis, who played Laurie Strode in Films 1 and 2, the new script created the character of Jamie, who would be Laurie's daughter. The girl is played by the great Danielle Harris, who made her movie debut on Halloween 4. Another important element is that the plot takes place in the town of Haddonfield, the same setting as the first two films. With these characters, it would be easy for the writers to create a story that would please fans.The film starts on Halloween Eve and Michael Myers will be transferred to another sanatorium. Without Dr. Loomis's consent, the ambulance follows the killer, who ends up hearing that he has a niece. It doesn't take long for him to wake up, kill everyone in the ambulance and head towards the girl. In Haddonfield, Jamie lives with foster parents after Laurie died in a car accident. The girl, who doesn't know what happened to her mother in the past, has terrifying nightmares of Michael Myers, whom she refers to as the bogeyman. The day dawns, it's Halloween and Michael arrives in Haddonfield.The premise assumes exactly what the public wants to see: Michael Myers in his rampant slaughter. Without ghoulish Halloween masks or too many fabrications, Alan B. McElroy's script appears almost like a nostalgic journey into the past, again bringing out the Halloween night vibe and the little teen dramas of new characters. It's not a brilliant job, even with Loomis returning alive after being blown up along with Michael at the end of the second chapter, and his obsession around Myers again appealing to ridiculous phrases like ""he's not a man, he's evil "".The difference is the introduction of a child at the center of the story, as was done in Friday the 13th, The Final Chapter. Little Danielle Harris is able to elicit empathy throughout the narrative, whether because of the fact that she suffers heavy bullying for her tragic condition (being an orphan), missing her mother and efficient relationship with her adoptive sister, Rachel ( Ellie Cornell). The mere image of Harris running awkwardly down a dark street in a clown costume is a good representation of the film's horror brand, which aptly explores - albeit abruptly - the loss of innocence. Jamie and Rachel suffer a lot at the hands of Michael, Jamie especially. The film gets a point for showing something that is not so common, an 8-year-old girl being persecuted without mercy, it is important to note that Jamie is a child, not a 20-year-old actress playing an 8-year-old girl. Roof of the sheriff's house, a school, and a chase involving a moving car.Alan B. McElroy's script tries to solve some doubts and questions in an expository way so that the film can get straight to the point, bringing a big hunt where we follow Loomis' journey to follow in parallel with Myers' pursuit in search of his niece, in this point the script is very functional and brings the necessary for a horror and suspense work, balancing mystery, police chase and horror scenes in just the right measure, while still expanding its own universe by developing in Jamie Lloyd, a potential character who would take the franchise through the coming years, in addition to giving greater prominence to Sam Loomis, placing him as a survivor of the events of past films and the only one capable of trying to stop Michael Myers.The mood and tension are strong and particular, there are scenes that involve Jamie's psychological, most of them involving nightmares. We noticed a change in the structure of the film compared to its predecessors as well, there are more deaths and there is a focus on the massacre provoked by the killer, the atmosphere of suspense hasn't changed much, but we notice the time difference. Remember: 10 years have passed from this to the original so that original vibe is not so present here. The last minutes before the closing credits are loaded with tension and an unusual situation suggesting that the franchise would follow another pace from there. It was the same with ""Friday 13 part 5 A New Beginning"" where the ending suggests a restart for the franchise. The scene has a heavy atmosphere and it sure gave a good break for a possible part five. So we can say that the movie doesn't have a perfect 'end', as we don't know if Michael really died, we don't know what happened to Jamie and we don't know what happened to Dr. Loomis. These questions would be answered in 1989 with ""Halloween V: The Revenge of Michael Myers"".Directing, Dwight H. Little does his best to emulate John Carpenter's style (even going to rhyme nicely with the original's POV prologue), but offers a different approach for Myers. Once a silent assassin of the shadows, his figure is now that of a practically invulnerable and brutish being, the kind that uses a shotgun to impale its victims against the wall. Jump scares are more present this way, but Little manages to capture the sense of danger on the loose when the narrative establishes a blackout in Haddonfield, prompting a group of police officers to go out into the streets to hunt Michael down. With Peter Lyons Collister's bluish and blurred photography and Alan Howarth's efficient soundtrack (who is happy without Carpenter's synthesizers, even though his subject is present), it is possible to have moments of tension. Little also does a good job of tinkering with the suggestion of things. We don't always have Michael Myers brandishing his famous machete, but we know he's there. We know he killed those characters. And the coolest thing involving everything is that throughout the first and a part of the second act of the film this suggestive atmosphere is even greater for the characters. There is the suspicion of whether it is Michael Myers terrorizing wherever he goes or not, considering the physical state he was in.It doesn't take a genius to realize that Halloween 4 sounds almost like a plagiarism from the original movie. However, the direction of Dwight H. Little makes good use of the script by taking advantage of all these familiar elements, but it leverages the situations. It's interesting to note that for the first time, the city and residents decide to hunt down Michael Myers instead of leaving the job to the police. In addition, the film follows with a good pace, suspense scenes, violence and well-conceived characters. Of course, the movie also has some flaws and forced moments in the script, like when Michael simply ""breaks into"" a moving truck and kills everyone. By the way, some deaths are unnecessary and if the first movie contained few murders, but all were well staged, in Halloween 4 it is possible to lose count of how many characters die.There is only one huge problem in this matter: inexplicably, the Michael Myers mask is ridiculous. Looking like an imitation of the original, it's impossible not to look at this Michael and crack an involuntary laugh, as we seem to be standing in front of a giant inflatable doll. The big merit is when Myers doesn't use the iconic look, appearing with his face bandaged in the opening scenes; consequence of its incineration in the second film. Another issue is that much of the film is centered on a cliché plot. The murderer running away, killing and dying. The nice older sister and betrayed by her boyfriend helping her adoptive sister to survive, the police who most of the time are coming and going in cars with the sirens on, and the stupidity of the townspeople that gets to annoy, especially in the end with a very convenient script. These factors may bother you a little because unlike the first movie, everything that was mentioned is nothing new in a horror movie.""Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers"" doesn't quite make an impact as strong as the first film, but it manages to make audiences forget ""Halloween III - The Night of the Witches"" and gets back on track with the Michael Myers films, with characters known to fans and bringing a good mix between police chase, slasher and thriller. Even though it's a recycling of other ideas from the competition - and it doesn't even remotely match the brilliance of the original - The Return of Michael Myers is a good sequel. It's efficient at updating and bringing new ideas to the same claustrophobic and Halloween night concept, while offering clever rhymes with its original.",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers

100,gavin-thelordofthefu-48-460297,Arguably the best entry of the series!,9,30 October 2012,"I liked the first three Halloween films. The original wasn't as scary as I thought it was when I watched it a few times, but it was still a horror classic. The first sequel was flawed, but was pretty decent in my opinion while Halloween III: Season of the Witch, despite the story's plot holes and the main villain's confusing death, was underrated due to it's creative premise and it's spooky and atmospheric soundtrack. So, when the producers wanted to bring Michael Myers back at Halloween II, they released their fourth entry ""The Return of Michael Myers"", released in 1988, seven years after the second installment. After I saw Halloween V, which was the first installment I've watched in television a few years ago, but I'll get to that film sometime later, Halloween IV was the second installment I've also watched and to my surprise, it's arguably the best in the series it even surpasses the original Halloween.Sure, some of the characters are underdeveloped and would've given a lot more depth to them, but that flaw is completely wiped out by it's praises. The story captures the tone and spirit of the original Halloween and makes it both engaging and terrifying. The direction from Dwight H. Little is excellent and did a very good at creating a mood of suspense and atmosphere. It's also well-paced and the music from Alan Horvath, once again teaming up with John Carpenter, is excellent and gives out what they have with some of the most atmospheric moments which fits really well in the film like the previous entries. The death scenes are also gruesome and creative, but the strongest aspect goes too the ensemble cast who gave out their amazing performances they had used especially the ever loyal Donald Pleasance and Danille Harris who did a fantastic job as Jamie Lloyd.Overall, Halloween IV: The Return of Michael Myers is by no means the best of the series and is always worth-watching for fans of the original classic.

Some of the early scenes are sloppy and uncoordinated, though director Dwight H. Little (ANACONDAS: THE HUNT FOR THE BLOOD ORCHID) finds his feet during the film's second half, when Harris and her family are forced into a confrontation with Myers during a town curfew imposed by the sheriff's department at Pleasence's insistence. Contrivances come thick and fast, as various characters meet unspectacular deaths at the hands of the mindless killer, further isolating the object of Myers' onslaught. Harris - straight out of Cute-As-A-Button Central - gives a heroic performance for one so young (she turned 11 during production, though she looks younger), and she stands out in an otherwise nondescript cast (which includes exploitation stalwarts Michael Pataki and Kathleen Kinmont). Working from a lackluster script (by Alan B. McElroy), Little fails to energize the feeble plot, and the results are entirely routine, though the climactic 'twist' may strike some as genuinely subversive.

It was a runaway sensation which spawned hundreds of imitators and continues to even now. Whenever a movie is financially successful, you can bet on it studios are going to demand a sequel. ""Halloween II"" followed the original in 1981 without Carpenter's direction. It picked up exactly where the first one left off. An attempt to take the ""Halloween"" franchise into a different direction without the help of serial killer Michael Myers chopping away at victims failed in a third movie. The decision was made to re-instate the successful formula of the first two films with the next installment, ""Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers."" Anchor Bay released a new Blu-ray version of the 1988 movie and it looks marvelous. It's the 10th anniversary of the Halloween night massacre in Haddonfield, Illinois.

The movie takes viewers back to the familiar location of Haddonfield 10 years later. It shows us how the town has dealt with the many deaths of their family members a decade before. There's also a direct tie to the first two films because the character of Jamie is the daughter of Laurie Strode. We see the return of Dr. Loomis and gain some insight into what happened to him after the hospital fire in ""Halloween II."" It's interesting to note that there are very few actual scenes of stabbing or hacking. Director Dwight H. Little chose to go for a ""less- is-more"" approach and cuts away from direct scenes of penetrating carnage. It gives the film a bit of a Hitchcockian atmosphere. You can tell Little wanted to focus more on the suspense and less on the graphic violence. However, there's still plenty of blood and gore to thrill horror enthusiasts. Actor Danielle Harris is perfect as the character of Michael Myers' nine-year-old niece, Jamie. She moves back and forth through emotions quite effectively and is convincing in the role. Donald Pleasance pours his heart and soul into his portrayal of Dr. Loomis for a third time. It's excellent to see a veteran actor of his caliber take a part in what most would call a simple slasher film and treat it with such a high level of sincerity. The high-definition transfer looks and sounds excellent. The picture maintains its original feel but is clear and precise at the same time. The audio delivers all the slashing, screams, and pulsating music your nerves can take thanks to a 5.1 surround mix. Special features for this edition include two separate audio commentaries with actors Ellie Cornell and Danielle Harris and director Dwight H. Little and author Justin Beahm. The ""'Halloween 4 / 5' Discussion Panel"" from the 25th Anniversary celebration is also here. It contains a theatrical trailer as well. Fans of the franchise who are always looking for the latest and greatest versions of these films will want to run out and buy the new ""Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers"" Blu-ray from Anchor Bay. Consumers will also be happy with its slightly altered but new packaging. Some interesting bonus material sweetens the deal and adds value to the product. http://contributor.yahoo.com/user/849014/eric_shirey.html",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
105,acidburn-10,The Shape is back,7,6 September 2007,"Well firstly the plot, Michael Myers thought to be dead, burned alive after the events of part 2 is getting transferred to another hospital, but surprise surprise he comes back alive kills a few doctors and heads back to Haddonfield. Instead of trying to kill his sister Laurie, he's trying to kill his niece Jamie (Danielle Harris) because apparently Laurie died in a car accident a few years before and Dr Loomis (Donald Pleasence) is also back and also thought to be dead is hot on his tracks, but can Dr Loomis save the day again.It's nice to see Michael Myers back again after Halloween 3 nearly destroyed the Halloween franchise by having a completely different storyline that doesn't follow any of the Halloween films and having no Michael Myers what a travesty. So Halloween 4 is welcomed with open arms. Halloween 4 is a pretty decent sequel but sadly doesn't have the same style and tension as the first 2 had. Again Michael Myers goes on a killing spree like he did while trying to kill his sister but this time he's after his niece and well this time he takes it to the next level going on one major rampage after another. He blows up a petrol station wipes out an entire police station and kills the town's electricity just so he can kill his poor young sweet and innocent niece Jamie. Halloween 4 though is quite dull at times and doesn't have the same feel as the first Halloween film but again it haves an even bigger body count and intense stalk scenes like the famous rooftop stalk scene which is nail biting and definitely the best scene in the whole film, but the ending was a bit over the top and way to predictable other than that Halloween 4 is a decent entry.Donald Pleasence (Loomis) can do no wrong. Loomis is crazier, more obsessed and very determined. Mr. Pleasence is on top of it all. Ellie Cornell (Rachel) gives a grounded, pleasant performance a worthy final girl really likable and it's nice to see a normal final girl for a change that can actually act and not some big breasted bimbo, I really love the whole girl next door image. Danielle Harris (Jamie) is a big part of the whole Halloween saga a key player and considering her young age she holds up very well and gives an outstanding performance you really feel her fear, it's a pity she never became a bigger star and Kathleen Kinmont (Kelley) gives a decent show but her performance is overshadowed by how good she looks in a T-shirt. George Wilbur (Michael) walks the walk and is a bigger dude than the previous Michaels.All in all Halloween 4 is a decent entry in the Halloween franchise.",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers

Now he has been resurrected as he escapes back to Haddonfield where it's his hunting ground, Laurie Strode has passed away due to a car accident leaving her 8 year old daughter Jamie Lloyd (Danielle Harris) to be raised by adoptive parents. Dr. Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasance) is alive but half of him is badly burned from that night soon discovers Michael is out to kill his niece for only Loomis with a few locals can stop him from getting near her.Very good sequel in the franchise that brings back the Michael Myers storyline after ""Halloween III: Season of the Witch"" disappointed viewers. John Carpenter originally intended the series to be a big screen horror anthology along the lines of ""The Twilight Zone"" telling different theatrical horror movies revolving around the title holiday rather then just Michael Myers again, but fans were left bitter with part 3 and the Anthology idea ended. Carpenter gave up on the Halloween franchise leaving it to Moustapha Akkad to take over, writer Alan McElroy brought the character Michael back on the screen as fans wanted and it became a hit. The acting was good including Harris's and there was some cool killings like the shotgun shoved through the torso of a person. The storyline isn't too bad and there's a cool yet bizarre twist in the end that is more haunting then the ending to ""Sleepaway Camp"".",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
109,raypdaley182,Sheer ridiculous fantasy,1,18 August 2006,"The dream at the start is totally obvious. Especially when the door opens when it's looked, then she turns around and it's closed and locked again.If they knew Micheals history (and they clearly did because they asked about him and spoke about him) then he'd be being transported a lot more securely. That's goof number 1. He'd be in a straight jacket, secured to the bed. And I don't care how superhuman he is, no-one can put their thumb through an adult human skull. That's goof number 2.The explosion at the gas station was unlikely - A van just pulling out wouldn't have blown up the pump, and the blast didn't kill Loomis. Goof number 3. The little girl looking at the picture of her ""dead mother"", Jamie Lee Curtis. But doesn't she come back in H20? SO she isn't dead? Why wouldn't she be with her daughter? Goof number 4.Now you have to wonder why the only living relative of Micheal Myers would want to live in Haddonfield, let alone live in his old house. He gets into their house way too easily as well, don't people lock their doors in a town where people were murdered.You'd also think the police would more readily listen to the Doctor who looked after Myers his whole life.Racheal soon ignores her child-minding duties after an argument with her boyfriend. I thought Jamie would know better than to go off without her adult supervision though. I loved the fact that all the guys who had been drinking in the bar all just jumped right into their trucks without a care for the idea of drunk driving.The Sheriff asks only 1 cop to stay at the little girls house? Hasn't he heard of safety in numbers? Also for an ""invalid"" as he's described by many people, Micheal sure does a lot of walking and gets around real fast between places. Both Jamie & Racheal thought they were being followed but even Myers couldn't have been following them both at the same time. And how stupid were those 3 boys dressing up like Myers. The Sheriff should have shot them all.You also known Racheals former boyfriend is going to die at Micheals hands after screwing her friend. And that Myers was already in the Sheriffs house before they locked it all up. Another example of people who don't seem to lock house doors.The posse of men who'd been in the bar drinking killing a man by mistake shows why people shouldn't be allowed to have guns.Also, where did Myers get his mask? He's very strong for someone whose supposedly spent his entire adult life in an asylum under sedation. How did he get to build that strength? I did question why a child running down the road, at night in a town with no power screaming and shouting somebody help me didn't attract attention in seconds? And a school with an external alarm that you can't hear inside the school. Goof 5. Myers hair magically changing color? Goof 6.How the hell did Myers get on the back of the truck? He never came out the school and they were on the move. The Trucks were never left alone, MAJOR GOOF! And how Myers was able to hold onto the fast moving truck AND hold onto the knife? Occasionally I wish someone would make a horror film that didn't have glaring holes and goofs in it. And after being shot THAT many times I don't care who you are, you are DEAD! But no, even after being told by Loomis that Myers is dead we're still teased by another scare. The child kills her foster mother just like Myers killed his sister. But why? She had no motive or reason.Another awful piece of tripe with more holes than Swiss Cheese.",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers

Instead...people are still trick r' treating. Teen girls with big knockers are still babysitting (the source of much of Michael's anger). And now we have the daughter of Laurie Strode? Whaaaaaaat?Yes folks, regardless of the more modern ""Halloween"" (2020) traumatized mask killer Laurie got it on and got a kid, known as Jamie Lloyd. And here in 1988 it's played by Danielle Harris. By the way, who is the Dad here? Would it have been Billy from part II?God, who cares?For some reason, this triggers Mikey to come looking for his niece (since we discover Laurie is Mikey's sister) and he just has a need to butcher his own kin. No explanation for that. But he is also chased by the never quit Dr. Loomis played by series regular Donald Pleasance. Loomis knows the town is about to get hit with Hurricane Myers so he warns the town. And, well, they do batten down the hatches. To their credit, they must've watched a horror film. But not before carnage happens.
This movie bored me. A lot. Even when it first came out, I recall it felt like a straight-to-video movie. John Carpenter knew a few things. A) spend the money to use the best equipment B) have a director with a vision. To which case, Dwight H. Little, as functional as he is, always felt like a hired gun. No sense of vision. He's just very serviceable as a director. Perfectly okay, but somehow in this instance it was a disappointment. I mean, ""Halloween III"" really put a bur into people about the return of MM. This just felt very hollow in its respect. Not having the original makers didn't help.
All in all, it's an OK entry. Better than what follows for the next...um...30+ years.",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
111,Rickting,They should have just made it a ghost story like planned,4,28 September 2014,"The Halloween franchise made a good move after the second film. The makers wanted to make it an anthology series but unfortunately the fandom had their say and Michael Myers, despite having been blown up and blinded in the better than expected Halloween II, is resurrected in this far from awful but lame sequel. Jamie Lee Curtis isn't around in this one, and her young daughter who is living with foster parents is being stalked by Michael, who wakes from a coma after 10 years and returns to Haddonfield. In my opinion, the first Halloween in a masterpiece and while imitated often, has never been equalled. The second one isn't bad, but this is presumably when the series went into stupidity. It isn't unwatchable. Technically, it's moderately efficient and a couple of chilling nightmares and a very clever scene involving multiple Michaels gave me the shivers, while Donald Pleasance is still excellent as Sam Loomis. The best scene of the film is when Loomis confronts Michael at a gas station, but sadly after that Loomis is underused, although Myers is still the boogyman and still a brilliant villain. The new main characters are good as well.What lets this down is its stupidity. It has multiple plot holes and one of the stupidest third acts of a horror film ever. Michael Myers disappears in front of Loomis in a split second. Michael's niece wanders off from her foster sister. Michael Myers turns up inside a house despite the fact that all the doors and windows are locked. A man tries to fight Michael by punching him in the face. Michael teleports from the roof of a house to the ground, then to a school and then onto a moving truck. Michael Myers turns into Kenny from South Park as he continuously survives everything. You get the idea. The film stops being scary after a while, and it just becomes monotonous and predictable. It's a shame because the film does start out well, but it then just descends into numbing stupidity and gaping plot holes. It's not a terrible film and it is a watchable one, but the film feels almost desperate to get its scares and there is a sense that the film is just a money grabber. Fans of the franchise will enjoy it as it is a good cinematic universe and delivers on the horror thrills, but I personally feel maybe it's time for Michael just to stay dead. Unfortunately, we've still got another 4 films to go before that might happen.4/10",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers

Rising supernaturally from the grave, Michael is back and in pursuit of the next generation.This film embodies the same kind of feeling as the direct-to-video Hellraiser instalments. This doesn't feel like a Halloween film; it feels like a standard, middle-of-the-road slasher that was quite literally created with no intentions of incorporating Michael, only to have him written in at the last minute to sell the script before being released as a Halloween movie. What happened to Jamie Lee Curtis' character was nothing short of pure laziness. I'm not saying this wasn't originally a Halloween script, but they sure do a great job of making it feel like it isn't.Following the generally negative reception of Season of the Witch (which, as previously stated, would've been a much bigger hit had Halloween 2 not existed to carry on the story of Michael Myers), the studio put some major pressure on the creative team to bring back Michael. The attempt to make an anthology series was thwarted by the studio demanding a continuation on the original, and then was demolished entirely due to negative reception to introducing the anthology element in the third film.One can't help but imagine what might've happened in an alternate universe where Halloween 2 didn't exist, Halloween 3 was a hit and the series was able to maintain its anthology intentions. We certainly wouldn't have been ""blessed"" with this bland film.Without the Halloween banner, this is definitely destined for the DNF pile.

115,PedroPires90,Not bad,6,22 September 2021,"It's not that great compared to the first two but it's not the abomination that is the third one. This film also suffers from a problem that other horror franchises don't have: Halloween films take themselves too serious. Too damn serious if you consider that the plot are usually pretty weak.On this one they just want us to show that Michael is back (lol even the title). I liked that the police tried a totally different strategy this time and they listened Loomis, even if after that, there is a series of stupid decisions.In general, not close to the first two, not as tense and not that inspired, feeling sometimes a bit soulless. However, the performances are not bad here, some deaths are pretty good and we have Myers and Loomis back. I like the ending too.",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
116,ofumalow,"Not bad, could be (much) better",5,4 November 2021,"This first revival of the series is a straightforward continuation (albeit without Jamie Lee Curtis, whose character is explained as having died in a car crash) with which there's nothing wrong save a lack of inspiration. It anticipates the recent ""Halloween Kills"" in involving armed vigilantes who naturally bring more harm to themselves than to their quarry Michael Myers after he escapes while being transferred to a new facility. He goes straight for surviving family members, killing anyone he encounters in between.The film is well-made and preserves some of the original's aesthetics, but without its suspense or sense of dread--here, the kills come all too quickly, and are dispatched without much brio. (There's an odd lack of graphic violence, as if the producers thought ""Well, a 'Halloween' sequel certainly isn't the place for THAT!"") The cast is OK but their dialogue and character conceptions are mediocre at best, something that is explained in a DVD extra where a writer explains that he had to churn the screenplay out from scratch in 11 days because a writers' strike was on the horizon. So, needless to say, the script feels like a rush job. I'm not sure why the direction has a similar feel though--this movie needs the original's eerie atmosphere, and while the production values are there, it just plows forward at a hectic pace that provides little time for building tension.There are certainly worse films in the series, but ""4"" is a little disappointing just because it comes so close to being very good, with all the needed elements in place, yet it doesn't seem to be trying quite hard enough.

Halloween 4 should not have been made I think. Halloween II ended with Michael Myers being shot in both eyes and blown up, and Dr. Loomis being blown up along with him. I think that ending is good enough. But no, of course not. Michael must somehow survive that. And Loomis too. That knocks this movie's rating down 2 stars.Also, Michael is no longer a sneaky stalker. Now he is more like Jason Voorhees. I like Jason, there is no need for a Jason Knock-off(and people say Friday the 13th copied off Halloween? I think its vise versa, and this movie is proof), -2 more stars. However, despite the countless flaws, this movie was actually still entertaining.

123,malkane316,Quick Reviews!!,7,7 December 2004,"POSSIBLE SPOILERS!!Michael Myers hears he has a niece and decides it is time for him to rise from his coma and begin his hunt again, having been burnt to a crisp 10 years earlier. He escapes from hospital and heads for Haddonfield, and for his niece Jamie, a pre teen girl. Unlike the previous 2 sequels, Halloween 4 has some effective scares and a decent plot. While it is still a cash in on the original, 4, and 5 are the only other films in the series which can stand respectably with the original. Not as good, but not as terrible as you might expect. This is largely because of Danielle Harris' performance, she outshines every other cast member, who admittedly are playing stupid teens ready to be slaughtered, but the range of emotions she shows at such a young age proves that she is the best actress of her generation. However, she can't get a decent role, and is content to do voices for The Wild Thornberries etc. As with most slasher sequels, the kill count is very high and the death scenes more elaborate and ridiculous, with most of the central characters being wiped out. Unlike most slasher sequels though, the script is good, and the twist at the end is very effective, if a little strange, considering the events in number 5. The director does well, creating a fair amount of tension, and we do not simply sigh as we wait for the inevitable next kill and final showdown. Pleasance returns and is as good as ever, but he now is beginning to show signs of insanity, as Myers is taking over his life. Overall this does have a few of the expected flaws of a sequel, but it will surprise you by being better than you would think. 8 out of 10",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers

125,theshadow908,Michael's back but...He's different somehow.,6,18 May 2006,"Six years after the terrible Halloween III, someone had the brilliant idea of making a 4th Halloween movie and actually including Michael in the story. Halloween 4 takes place 10 years after Halloween I and II. Michael Myers has been in a coma from his wounds. Dr. Loomis is severely scarred from the fire of Halloween II, but he's still alive. Laurie Strode has died in a car accident, but she left behind a daughter, Jamie. This news stirs Michael from his coma, and he makes his way back to Haddonfield with Loomis on his trail. Halloween 4 brings back our favourite slasher movie killer, and it brings back the eerie feel of the first two movies, but something is different this time.Unknown director Dwight H. Little took control of the director's chair for what many consider to be the best Halloween sequel. He didn't do a lot to improve upon what was already done. I mean, he's no John Carpenter. He kind of copies what the previous movies were like, but he doesn't really get what they were. The evidence behind this is the way Michael Myers has changed. In the first two movies, he was a thin but muscular silent killer. He spent his time watching and analyzing his prey. When he finally moved in for the kill, he was quick and efficient, barely making a sound. In this movie, he's become a large muscular brute that is as sloppy and disgusting as Jason Voorhees from the Friday the 13th series. For instance, Michael used to use a knife. In this movie he uses a shotgun to impale somebody, and he throws a guy into power lines. I think the reason behind this may have been that in the time between Halloween II and Halloween 4, there were six Friday the 13th films released, and everybody was in the monstrous killer phase. Another thing is his mask. In the first two movies, his mask looked to be a part of him, like his actual face. In this movie his mask looks bulky and uncomfortable, and you can tell it's a mask. Also, the style has changed immensely.Overall, this is an entertaining entry to the series, but this is where it started to go downhill, not counting Halloween III of course. I recommend it to slasher fans.6/10",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
126,bh_tafe3,A miracle of a movie,7,5 February 2009,"Trying to jump start a horror franchise after six years and three movies would not be easy, especially after the most recent film in the series had nothing at all to do with the first two. Coming up with a believable storyline for the fourth film despite the fact that the whole premise of this first two was that a psychotic maniac was trying to kill his last living family member, who didn't want to be in this movie, would also be quite difficult. Trying to find a decent child actor to put in a horror film would again be no easy task. And, even if you did all these things, could you find an audience for a character not seen on movie screens for the better part of a decade? Basically there were a lot of reasons why this movie was going to be an abysmal failure, and despite all of them, still worked a charm. Unlike the rather overdone fifth and sixth parts and the over rated scream clone H20, this one keeps a similar atmosphere to the first two movies, as Micheal awakes from a long coma to stalk his 10 year old niece Jamie Lloyd (played well by Danielle Harris).Donald Pleasance is again along for the ride as Sam Loomis, tracking Micheal back to Haddonfield and aiding Jamie and her foster sister, Rachel (Ellie Cornell) in evading Myers. There are some excellent chase scenes, including a very well filmed chase on a sloped rooftop.The kills in this are many and varied. THe movie steers clear of blood, concentrating instead on the sheer brute strength of Micheal. The victims aren't all idiots like in most horror films. They stay inside, board up the windows and get police protection, but still can't stop he evil Micheal Myers.The film ends on a cliff hanger, again channeling the original film as Lloyd, wearing the same suit as Myers in the original, puts on a mask, walks upstairs and stabs her foster mother.There is some sex scenes and nudity, but it's all mild.

127,akshatmahajan,Had potential,5,10 October 2020,"Halloween 4 had potential but it failed. The movie had all the elements which made first part masterpiece but these elements were not effective in this part mainly due to less interesting story, less suspense, plot holes, senseless screenplay and bad direction. It seemed like director didn't do his homework. He made Myer's tall, healthy and his mask was also little bit different.Only good thing was the performance of Danielle Harris who plays Jamie. She plays the character with complexity, fear, determination, and desperation so well.If you're a fan of the original Halloween, you will like Halloween 4 to a certain degree.

Even with that in mind, HALLOWEEN 4 is as lame, predictable and clichéd as any other slasher pic you can think of. While being transported from one hospital to another, Michael escapes, acquires his signature mechanic's jumper and ""Shape"" mask in a local hardware store and sets out to find and kill his previously unmentioned little niece (Danielle Harris). Lots of monotonous stalking, plenty of ranting from a haggard looking Donald Pleasanse (who appears to have suffered only a burned cheek and bad knee as a result of being blown up), but little suspense and less logic. Harris turns in an impressively strong performance for a ten year old, but it's far from enough to breathe any life into this boring, pointless series entry. Some critics actually enjoyed this one, but, other than the fact that it isn't quite as bad as parts 5 or 6, I have no idea why.

130,Coffee_in_the_Clink,"""Don't try that Halloween **** with me!""",8,5 October 2021,"I bet there must have been quite a buzz around this film in 1988 - the return of Michael Myers after seven years in ""Halloween II"" in '81. That first sequel was meant to be the last film to feature Myers in John Carpenter's mind, so in between we were treated to ""Season of the Witch"", a Halloween tale that had nothing to do with Haddonfield or Myers, and was universally slated by both critics and horror fans at the time. In recent years, it has acquired a strong cult following and fanbase, which I myself am part of. ""The Return of Michael Myers"", not surprisingly, has no Carpenter or Hill in the credits, apart from a mention for the music.This is an extremely underrated film. The opening sequence is superb; gorgeous Halloween imagery. The ""Halloween 4"" logo is a melting orange colour against an autumn background; Halloween decorations hang ominously from trees and farm machinery. Then we learn that Michael Myers survived the ending of ""Halloween II"" and is in a new high-security sanitorium, and is about to be transferred to another facility. Of course, he escapes, leads a trail of dead bodies in his wake, and heads for Haddonfield, where his young niece lives. Dr. Loomis also survived the ending of ""Halloween II"" and he is hot on Michael's trail, who has a fresh and identical mask right off the shelf.The film moves at an excellent pace. Donald Pleasance is excellent as always; he would have made this watchable even if it was a bad film. The ending is fantastic and caps off a film that is abundant in scares and jump scenes without relying heavily on the gore.Very underrated horror film and sequel.",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers

Michael Myers is alive and being transferred again from a state mental institution. He survived the explosion that should have killed him, but hey we are in sequelville. He kills the people in the ambulance that he is being transported in and goes back to Haddonfield. We meet Jamie, the daughter of Laurie Strode, who is dead. Jamie is played by Danielle Harris in a very good child performance. Of course, she is Michael's new target. She lives with her adoptive family the Carruthers. Her sister Rachel takes care of her. The plot is simple again, Michael looks for his niece so he could kill her. Dr. Loomis is also back, again, he blew up in H2 but here he has just some light burns. We go through the motions of Michael picking off people in search of Jamie, and it is done in an efficient but unimaginative way. There are a couple decent scares but nothing compared to the 1978 original.

It's too bad the future sequels did not follow in the direction as this movie. This could have moved the movies in a different direction.

141,happyendingrocks,An uneven but overall solid chapter of the Michael Myers legacy,7,24 October 2012,"Let's get this right out in the open: John Carpenter's Halloween is probably the best horror film ever made. Keeping that in mind, any sequel is bound to elicit a measure of disappointment simply because matching or exceeding the peerless kickoff to this series is an impossible feat. But despite an extremely spotty track record, the (admittedly over-)extended Halloween franchise has its share of strong efforts, and this fourth installment certainly deserves to be mentioned in that capacity.The most effective aspect of The Return Of Michael Myers is how closely it adheres to the atmosphere and spirit of the original, and though there is a clear effort made to incorporate some overt bloodshed to please fans of the '80s splatter cycle, Halloween 4 has even more in common with the first ""Night HE Came Home"" than the hastily made but suitably enjoyable part II. This offering faithfully duplicates the deceptively ominous leaf-strewn streets of Haddonfield, the manic fervor of the returning Dr. Loomis, and, most importantly, the deadly disposition of ""The Shape"" him(it?)self. At this point in the series, we're still a couple of sequels away from quasi-mystical ramblings about ancient Pagan symbols and ""hip and edgy"" self-aware contemporary updates, and, thankfully, we're a world removed from Rob Zombie's obtusely trippy white stallion hallucinations. So, the Michael Myers we get here is the same remorseless and unyielding killing machine we were introduced to ten years before, and his purpose is equally singular and inexplicable. That's precisely what makes him the perfect Boogeyman, and Return wisely maintains the air of menace and mystery that later entries watered down by neutering our series figurehead via ridiculous plot elements that were closer to parody than they were to anything resembling horror. Halloween 4 isn't about rappers doing battle with a pop culture serial slayer, it's about a malevolent force stalking and killing anyone who gets in its way, and at least in that sense, the film remains true to its aim.The impetus for the titular Return is Michael's eight year-old niece Jamie Lloyd, the orphaned daughter of the, we're informed, deceased Laurie Strode (H2O et al. decided differently, but this development works for our purposes here). If you can accept the apparent psychic bond that allows Jamie to have nightmares about the uncle she's never seen before he re-appears in Haddonfield and Michael's myopic fixation on murdering a relative he really shouldn't know even exists, this cat-and-mouse aspect of the plot falls into place rather nicely.Jamie is played by the debuting Danielle Harris, who delivers an absolutely fantastic performance, especially given her age and lack of experience. Harris was a great find, and even during the film's most harrowing sequences, her acting chops easily rival those of any of her more seasoned cast-mates. Her youth ends up being a major asset because of its direct deviation from the archetypes of the strict slasher formula, and the fact that a relatively defenseless child is at the nucleus of Michael's murderous rampage heightens the tension immeasurably.Of course, Return does feature its share of goofiness. While the presence of Donald Pleasence is certainly welcome and integral to the story, his occasional dalliances with overblown histrionics create unfortunately cheesy moments out of a few scenes that should be bubbling with intensity. Also, though The Shape is as formidable and sadistic here as fans would hope for, his ability to teleport from an industrial power plant to a suburban neighborhood in the span of one scene, and to apparently hide beneath the chassis of a moving pick-up truck for several miles before climbing into the bed and catching the passengers unaware, strikes a serious blow against the hyper-realism that grounds the most potent terror elements in the series.But despite the sillier aspects here, the film as a whole hits more often than it misses. Several references to Carpenter's benchmark such as an homage to the POV murder which launched the saga and Jamie's donning of a clown costume identical to the one worn by her uncle when he was her age keep part 4 closely tied to its source. Even better, the utilization of a few subtle shots of the iconic ghostly mask hidden deep in the background while the future victims go about their business completely unaware of their peril re-establish the lurking Shape persona which provided the original Halloween with its most indelible images. There's also a mirthful scene between the hitchhiking Dr. Loomis and a drunken fire-and-brimstone religious zealot that allows Pleasence to crack a smile for a change, which will remind savvy viewers of his endearingly coy grin after the ""Lonnie, get your ass away from there"" moment from 1978.You'll have to decide for yourself whether the dicey twist ending really works, but it certainly does finish off the film on a tremendously dark and shocking note, which is in keeping with the fairly serious tone Return maintains throughout. Chalk that at as yet another touch which sets this entry apart from some of the unbearably ridiculous drek that followed it.I'm not sure if I can definitively state that this is the best of the Halloween sequels, but it is most assuredly nowhere near the worst. I realize that's not a huge endorsement once you've seen how low this franchise proved itself capable of sinking later on, but you can consider it an endorsement nonetheless.",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
142,meathookcinema,A horror sequel for those who know NOTHING about good horror films,2,23 October 2020,"I remember when this was released on home video in 1988. I couldn't wait to watch it as the poster alone harked back to the original film, it's mythology and the very Panaglide soaked vision that helped make it such a masterpiece. I was hoping for the film to be just as impressive. If they could have a decent stab (pun not intended) at reproducing the feel of the first film with it's excellent first sequel taking place in Haddonfield Memorial Hospital then they could do it with this new film.However, the film was closer to the tacky UK poster made for the film. I saw H4 on home video and HATED it! Would I feel the same when I embarked on watching it recently as I did in 1989?The answer is 'Yes' I still hated it but with many more years of film criticism under my belt I was better equipped to articulate why I despise it so much.So what is Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers? It's part teen drama, part TV Movie of the Week, part very violent episode of Goosebumps and last but certainly not least, it's a cynical horror franchise sequel for idiots who wouldn't know a decent horror film if they tripped over it.The plot of the film goes like this- both Dr Loomis and Myers sustained horrific injuries after the literally explosive ending of Halloween 2 but both survived (of course). Mikey Boy has been in a coma for the ten years following this (the action takes place here during Halloween 1988) and is just about to be (stop if you think you've heard this one before...) transferred between hospitals. In the ambulance during this journey he hears that he has in fact got a niece and as she's unlucky enough to be within the female line of the Myers family tree he kills his escorts and escapes to try to get to his niece to finish her off.This is all so reminiscent of the first film that already the film shows that it's been made to give the fans exactly what they want but whilst not adding anything new when it comes to the plot. It also very quickly establishes that everything that made the first film a masterpiece doesn't get a look in.Halloween 4 really is just a man in a Michael Myers mask (and a crap one at that) stalking and killing people. No art, all base level vacuous nonsense. Not that a horror film has to be 'art' but a sense of tension, imagination and innovation are always welcome within a horror film project. Even making a blatant cash cow of a film project can still have all of these qualities whilst still giving the fans what they want and making a decent film at the same time.And what's worse, Michael's niece, Jamie is so unlikeable that you're just praying for Uncle Mikey to accomplish the job very quickly indeed.Not even the odd mildly entertaining moment such as the lynch mob killing the wrong guy instead of Michael can save this stodgy mess. The ending is so bad it's laughable. In fact, for a terrible moment the filmmakers even suggest with such an ending that a whole slew of movies which would feature Jamie as the killer. Now that would be REAL horror.You know you know nothing about horror or filmmaking in general if you walked out at the end of Halloween 3 and your first response was 'Where's Michael?!' instead of marvelling at it's brilliant cinematography, direction, soundtrack let alone being blessed enough to have spent an hour and a half in the company of Tom 'The Man' Atkins.Halloween 4 is the film made for people who just watch horror films because people are killed in them, without knowing anything about what makes a great horror movie. Halloween 4 is the anti-Halloween 3. And that's one of many reasons why I hate it so much.",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
143,Toronto85,Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers,7,29 June 2013,"'Halloween 4' see's the triumphant return of the main man of the Halloween series (Michael Myers) ten years after attacking babysitters and nurses on October 31st, 1978. Laurie Strode is nowhere to be found in this one. Michael instead sets his sights on murdering his 9-year old niece, Laurie's daughter Jamie. Back story to this one tells us that Laurie died in a car accident a while back, therefore her daughter was adopted by the Lloyd family. Michael Myers meanwhile has been locked away in a state facility, recovering from his burns following the hospital explosion in 'Halloween II'. It's the night before Halloween 1988 when a practically comatose Michael is being transferred to another clinic. He of course escapes and that's when his reign of terror begins yet again. Michael makes his way to Haddonfield, and Dr. Loomis is hot on his trail. He knows that Michael will be targeting his niece Jamie, so most of 'Halloween 4' is spent with Michael stalking Jamie and her adoptive big sister Rachel as the two are out trick-or-treating. Michael slashes his way through many people in order to get to innocent little Jamie, all leading up to a pretty shocking conclusion.I like 'Halloween 4' a lot. Not only does it bring Michael Myers back into the series, but it does well at creating the creepy atmosphere that was accomplished in the first two films. Haddonfield is still a dark little town on Halloween, it has a good resemblance of the streets in the 1978 film. The acting was done VERY well in this fourth instalment, especially from child actor Danielle Harris. She puts in a very believable performance as the tormented and terrified Jamie Lloyd. Ellie Cornell, as protective big sister Rachel, did a great job as well. The two had a great chemistry as the adoptive siblings.A flaw with 'Halloween 4' is that having a little child as Michael's target is not nearly as effective as it was having teenage Laurie Strode in the first two films. It just works better with an older person in the lead, and that's not a knock on Danielle Harris. It was just more engaging for me to see Michael go after someone a little older, instead of an innocent little child. Overall, 'Halloween 4' is a great sequel and addition to the series. Highly recommended.7/10",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers

They should've just called this one ""John Carpenter's Halloween: Mediocre Edition"" if I'm being frank. The newer films simply can't capture the raw and evenly paced direction that at least the first two entries enticed. With that aside, I'm glad they at least beefed up Michael Myers in this one.

146,Mr_Censored,The triumphant return of The Boogeyman,7,21 October 2008,"""Ten years ago, he tried to kill Laurie Strode. Now he wants her daughter."" - Sam LoomisAfter an unsuccessful, Michael Myers-less third installment in the ""Halloween"" series, the powers that be decided that it was time for Mikey to make his return to film -- ten years after the release of the original ""Halloween"" -- in the aptly titled ""Halloween 4: The Return Of Michael Myers"". Since Halloween is apparently a good time to transfer an inmate who is notorious for getting a little violent on the holiday, Michael escapes hospital care, returning home to find his niece, Jamie Lloyd (Danielle Harris). Jamie is the daughter of Laurie Strode -- who has incidentally passed away between films -- and is now under foster care. While Jamie goes trick or treating with her foster sister Rachel (Ellie Cornell), Dr. Loomis (surviving the explosion in ""Halloween II"" along with Myers) joins forces with a reluctant new police chief to stop Michael in his tracks before he trims another branch off his family tree. But, as you'll see by the end, history has a way of repeating itself.Director Dwight Little is no John Carpenter and that much is apparent from watching his incarnation of Michael Myers. Rather than try for suspense like the first two films, ""Halloween 4"" goes the slasher route, ala ""Friday the 13th"". It should come as no surprise, as the year was 1988 and the genre was either blossoming or bloating, depending on who you ask. Keeping that in mind and remembering that Little was lacking in the experience department, this fourth installment is actually one of the more respectable and substantial of the series. While conjuring up some fresh visuals -- such as in the opening credits -- Little's film has a tendency to look a bit pedestrian and doesn't quite carry the suspense that is so synonymous with the ""Halloween"" brand. What the film lacks in suspense, however, it makes up for in likable, believable characters and a swiftly moving plot. The character of Jamie Lloyd -- a traumatized and insecure seven year-old -- is sold perfectly by Danielle Harris, who would later reprise her role in ""Halloween 5: The Revenge Of Michael Myers"" and play another, altogether different role in Rob Zombie's recent remake. Harris rises above the typical child-actor stigma and delivers a performance that feels honest and real. Truth be told, if not for the character of Jamie and the portrayal by Harris, this would be a very different film. Her co-star, Ellie Cornell, is the ideal girl-next-door type, the perfect successor to Jamie Lee Curtis. Too bad we haven't seen much of her in modern films. Donald Pleasence is classic as Dr. Loomis, driving the character deeper into madness than he was in the second film. While the plot of the film is pretty basic and feels familiar, it works well because it moves so fluidly. Despite the movie looking unimpressive by today's standards, the solid story and strong characters are redeeming enough so that it can still be enjoyed today, even after multiple viewings. Overall, with few flaws to be found, ""Halloween 4: The Return Of Michael Myers"" is pretty much the most enjoyable of the series. It's got a distinct 80's feel and doesn't mind going for some cheap scares, but for the most part, it retains the class of the original movie, with a shocking ending full of potential, sadly deflated by the following installment.",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers

With this being the best part of that trilogy in my personal opinion.This is a great sequel to the original and a great introduction to some of my favourite characters in the franchise Rachel and Jamie two great characters and the hero's of this part they are really well acted especially Jamie played Danielle Harris a great kid actor in this film and part 5 which is very rare in the horror genre especially for a character that is introduced in the middle part of a franchise.Rachel is a great character and in my opinion one the most underrated final girls and in my opinion is up there Laurie Strode.Michael Myers is great in this one and it's such a great return for this character he looks bad ass and in my opinion one of th scariest looks Michael as had in the series especially the roof scene when he's chasing Rachel and Jamie.Once again my favourite part of the franchise is Donald Pleasance as Sam Loomis this character never gets old in my opinion and wherever Michael goes he's there to try and stop him. His performance in this one is amazing he is crazy in this one and you buy it considering what he's been through in previous movies and he knows it isn't over such a great character.My favourite scene in the movie is definitely that great shock ending with Jamie now becoming the evil such a creepy scene and very reminiscent of the scene at the beginning of the first one with point of view kill great sceneSomething I don't like in this one and the rest of Thorn trilogy is you really do miss Laurie and they kinda just brush over her death.
Also I'm not a fan of the bandage Michael I get it and it works for the scene but just not a fan of that look.Verdict 8.5/10 one my favourite sequels in the franchise bit of a flawed story but it's great and you do miss Laurie Strode",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
148,Sober-Friend,It is a story I thought of,10,24 May 2017,"In 1987 I was think the following year would be the 10th Anniversary of the original film. I knew there would be a ""Halloween IV"". For some reason I knew they would call it ""The Return of Michael Myers"". Now believe it or not I even thought he would go after his ""Niece"". What I didn't think of was ""In the past 10 years where was he""? I saw this film opening night and I saw it again the next day. I enjoyed the film. In was a logical progression of ""Where to take the Story"" since (At the time) Jamie Lee Curtis said ""Should would never do another Halloween"". Now this film is well made.

149,randyfromscream,It's fun to watch,7,31 December 2017,"It's good but not as good as the third one or H20 but it's kinda groundbreaking that Michael Myers is back. I don't like the ending because Jamie killed his step mom to become another Michael Myers and it's a bad idea! It's okay to set up a sequal but not like that way if you ask me. This deserve to have a 6.0 rating than a 5.9 rating honestly like it's a fun movie and good. I like the story, script, and characters. I like Jamie character because she's more interesting just like Tommy Jarvis from Friday The 13th Part 4 The Final Friday (1984). It's a fun movie with good character development so is it worth a watch? YEAH!! This is my review on Halloween 4 The Return of Michael Myers (1988), it's a good movie.Score: 7.5/10",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers

151,lotus_chief,A Good Sequel....,8,20 October 2003,"I had heard that this was arguably the best sequel in the Halloween series, so I was pretty eager to rent it.  After watching it just now, I was very pleased with it.  Reading reviews for Pt. 3, I learned very quickly to STAY AWAY from it.  It's safe to say that Halloween 4 is the REAL sequel to Pt. 2.  All of the major players are involved...except now Myers is after Laurie Strode's daughter, Jaimie.  The child actress was good, and Myers had some pretty inventive and gruesome killings, which is always good.  I liked the story, they used all of the original elements from the original Halloween, same town & characters....it could and has been seen as a tribute to the original.  The ending is pretty shocking and tragic...which helps the film hit home even more once it's finished.  I was very pleased, and agree with the opinion that it is indeed the best Halloween sequel.  Pt. 2 failed because all of the events took place in one place (the hospital).  Michael Myers makes a very good return here.*** out of **** stars.",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
152,FKDZ,It's alright,5,24 October 2020,"Decent little movie but continues reaching further and further.So to my surprise after thinking Loomis's end in H2 was a pretty good one he apparently survived the explosion and is back on screen pretty quick in H4. At first I didn't like it that much but Loomis was a lot more enjoyable in this film. And I accepted it pretty quick.Now generally I don't think this movie is better than H2, the pacing is just a bit slower than H2 and the characters aren't very interesting either. The babysitter and the girl, apparently Laurie had a kid but it stayed pretty vague in this movie, both were fine but a bit bland imo. Loomis is one of the few that brings a bit of personality in this.Now about the kills, it's a lot less interesting that H2 or H1. What disappoints me most is that a lot of them happen offscreen besides the usual amount of censoring. Like you don't really see the ambulance murders nor the police station murders. The few good ones happen in the police chief's house with his daughter and Brady but they aren't gory or anything. Now there are some really bad kills mainly because it was sloppy and just badly directed, and this scene was when Michael revealed himself on the back of the truck and killed those 3 townsfolk. The first two kills are over in a flash, and the 3rd guy just stands there not noticing anything when any human could CLEARLY notice things happening that close. It was just a really silly scene to watch.The way Michael looks in this I actually like, the design is slightly different and the mask has got a great creepy look to it. Especially being so clean as its brand new (as revealed he got it from the store).Now the directing in this movie kinda let me down coming from H1 and 2 which had some fantastic directing compared to this. Here just a lot of scenes were sloppy and it just wasn't as interesting. It's was just very much the basics. It also felt a bit lacking in good pacing. Now there are a few great shots of michael standing and hiding in some spots. Those worked really well.The story is a bit meh, if anything its starting to look like the F13 series where it just starts going further and further and there's always some character related to the killer. It is a lot more dynamic though. Whereas H2 only took place in the hospital here it pretty much goes anywhere in town.The ending came as a surprise though, so somehow Michael transferred his soul over to the little girl and she's ''evil'' now. Guess we'll see how this pans out in the sequel but I doubt it's gonna be her for long.5/10 decent but let down by kills, pacing and directing.",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
153,Tikkin,Not bad,5,13 March 2006,"I watched this expecting it to be terrible, but found that it actually wasn't too bad. Of course it doesn't come anywhere close to the original, or even the underrated Halloween 2, but it's better than a lot of slasher flicks out there. It starts off with Michael Myers again escaping from hospital, this time a charred shadow of his former self (remember the ending of Halloween 2?) He goes looking for his niece this time, back to Haddonfield. The story is basically a variation on the original, nothing new there. Halloween 4 fails because it doesn't deliver much suspense or gore. Most of the tense moments happen at the end, whereas in the original Halloween tension is built up throughout. I liked the rooftop scene and the car scenes, but the rest of the film is pretty dull and has teenage drama type sub-plots. Also worth noting is that the mask used in this film is terrible! It's nowhere near as creepy and menacing as the first two Halloween films. Oh well.",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
154,LanceBrave,Another Late-Eighties Murder Machine,5,5 November 2013,"I'm not a big fan of the direction this film took the series. Or more specifically, what it did with Michael Myers. Originally a ghost-like entity, Myers has become just another late-eighties murder machine. He slaughters people with a variety of weapons, including, rather incongruously, a shotgun. He teleports all around, even right behind people. He hangs off of pick-up trucks and leaps off roofs. He slaughters random people who have no further importance to the plot. Most obnoxiously, Myers tears victims apart with his bare hands, shoving his thumb through a forehead or fingers into a skull. You can't imagine Carpenter's subtle, stalking Shape doing that. Finally, the ending changes the Shape's nature entirely, making him some sort of possessing spirit. The biggest indignity of all is that lousy dime store mask and dorky shoulder pads.The ending of ""Halloween II"" is cheaply retcon. Despite getting shot in the eyes and burnt to a crisp, Myers simply fell into a coma. Okay, sure, he's not entirely human. But how do you explain Dr. Loomis, a normal human, surviving being exploded? With only small scars on his face and hands? Apparently, the doc is just a tough guy, since the sixty-year old survives getting tossed through an upper floor window in this one.No longer a random force, Myers is now determined to kill his remaining family for reasons that aren't elaborated on. How do I feel about Jaime Lloyd? I dislike Laurie dying off-screen. The movie really lingers on Jaime's misery too much, having nightmares about her uncle for some reason and being cruelly taunted by her schoolmates. Little Danielle Harris isn't great but she's not annoying, a feat onto itself. Though Ellie Cornell is no Jaime Lee Curtis, her Rachel is likable enough. Her romantic relationships are unnecessarily focused on, but Cornell has got a tough, can-do attitude I like. The rest of the characters are thin, indistinct slasher fodder. Rachel's boyfriend is unlikable and his bimbo doesn't even show her boobs. Despite being obviously tired and probably intoxicated, Donald Pleasence holds the whole film together. His grave intonings never loose their spark, even after ten years.Dwight Little's direction is fairly flat. I like the opening, titles sparsely laid out against Halloween decorations, and occasionally he throws in some foggy, late night atmosphere. Overall though, his nights are far too bright, too clear. He also throws in some tacky slow-motion shots. The movie is never scary but the roof stalking scene comes close to generating suspense. ""Halloween 4"" is middling for me but I suppose it is important for reviving the franchise. I guess.",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
155,LuboLarsson,One of the best Halloween's,7,13 July 2008,"This is easily one of the better Halloween movies. Its nowhere near as good as the original but is a definite step up from parts two and three. As the title clearly states Michael Myers is back on the rampage despite being shot twice in the eyes and set on fire in Halloween 2, don't you just love how horror films can always find a way to bring the bad guys back. The film starts well building an eerie atmosphere but its not long before Michael is back to his killing ways. As usual Dr Loomis is not far behind played as ever by the slightly over the top but excellent Donald Pleasence. Michael is of course heading back to Haddonfield to kill Jamie the daughter of the now deceased Laurie Strode from the first two Halloween movies, luckily for us Danielle Harris who plays Jamie is a superior child actress and not annoying in any way like so many characters in slasher movies are, her step sister is trying to protect her and is played well by Ellie Cornell. I feel the makers of this movie managed to make the main characters likable enough for us to care about them as Michael Myers stalks them later in the film. There are some nice moments of suspense and some suitably gory kills but at no time did I feel this film got close to matching John Carpenters original, they did however create a valid and entertaining movie which is all I expect from the fourth part of a slasher series, check out some of the later Friday the 13th movies to see how bad these films can get or later parts of this very series. All in all Halloween fans will thoroughly enjoy this instalment of the long running franchise.",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers

Michael has returned out of the 10 year coma he was in after the fire, he goes and looks for his niece who is the daughter of Laurie Strode(!), wants to killer her. Donald Pleasence who revives his character, is prob the best thing in this movie, as always. Danielle Harris, who plays the little girl Michael is after, is exceptionally well in her role.

Being the fourth in the series, nobody can expect much, except s**t. But hey, at least this one is consistent with the first two, unlike the last one. But, lets dig into this one step at a time.Ten years after the first, Michael Myers is taken by an ambulance from an institution. Where he awakens and breaks free. Donald Pleasence returns as doctor Samuel Loomis who hunts him down once again. (Yes, he actually survives from the second, just go with it). This time around though, since Michael can't find Laurie Strode, he decides to hunt down her young daughter, Jamie Strode.Without spoiling anything, Michael has some obsession for killing Laurie's family which you find out why in the second. I'll admit this movie sucks, but I don't really hate it that much. It didn't really try to act stupid, I understood what they were going for, and what they were trying to do. It just didn't work. The last one was just downright dumb as f**k.

160,refinedsugar,Return To Form,7,31 July 2000,"A sequel sporting the number four faces a lot of obstacles and maybe more so when it's the Halloween series we're talking about. At this movie's point in time, the series had developed a history of missteps both big and small. Coming off the heels of what I felt was a cash-in and inferior sequel in H2 and a Myers-less H3, H4 is noteworthy. It by no means breaks the mold, but when it is often championed as the best of the Halloween series next to the original that has to say something.John Carpenter had washed his hands of the series by now and for good reason and Jamie Lee Curtis seemed to be long gone, but H4 has a lot of things going right for it nevertheless. By no means a big budget movie, it still maintains the right look and feel due to decent production values. With a capable director at the helm, the story while simple in its execution, moves along at a good pace remaining engaging. It honestly shouldn't be this decent given this is the third sequel and the bumps in the road. The new characters introduced are rather memorable too. From the obvious choices of Danielle Harris and Ellie Cornell as Jamie Lloyd and Rachel Carruthers respectively to smaller but no less entertaining roles. Of course, Donald Pleasence, the backbone of the series in my book is the pinnacle cast member. Adding a much needed dose of respectability to the proceedings not to mention just being a lot of fun to watch as the tireless Dr. Loomis who's job never seems done.The rest they say is rather obvious. On a real basic level, H4 delivers enough scares and doses of atmosphere to stand up to repeat viewings. It isn't particularly gory or unnerving as far as horror movies go, but the Halloween formula has always been rather simple in its charm and H4 is faithful to this fact. This includes the always memorable Halloween theme that one can't forget. Series stable Alan Howarth delivers a great score that really compliments the movie. Not to say H4 is perfection. It's not. It's got a gaping plot hole (of sorts) and the usual horror movie clichés. You know the ones; the stupid characters (who you know will buy it before the end credits roll); Michael never is REALLY dead; and the obligatory wide open ending that points to some sort of possible sequel. Still all in all, I'm happy with H4's end result. This could have been a disaster (see: Halloween VI) of a movie in different hands, but wasn't. Definitely the best ""Halloween"" next to the original.",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers

162,shaun98,So-so,5,25 April 2002,"Well, it was inevitable. Michael Myers awakens from his coma after a ten-year (film time) absence, descending upon his hometown to wreak more murderous havoc. The fans angrily demanded his return after the disastrous ""Halloween III,"" and lo and behold, there he is again, slaughtering more horny teens for your viewing pleasure. Not that's there's anything wrong with it in principle, but ""Halloween 4"" is a thoroughly uninspired outing for the most part. Myers and Dr. Loomis are a bit worse for the wear, but all in all, they're back to their old business. I won't even get into the fact that by all rights, they shouldn't have survived the end of ""Halloween II."" The matter has never been satisfactorily explained, and I am not presumptuous enough to think I can resolve it in one capsule review.The only new twist is that Michael's niece figures in the story; she shares a psychic link with her infamous uncle. Danielle Harris actually does a pretty good job; most child actors are annoying, but she always hits the mark. Ellie Cornell also delivers a solid performance as the heroine, and Donald Pleasance settles comfortably into his old role, though his character is more unbalanced than ever.Overall, it's not a terrible movie. The director does a fairly good job in making it atmospheric, particularly the eerie opening credits. There's some good action, although some of the things Michael does (like cutting off the towns electricity) strain credibility. The ending is undeniably effective.

165,Lucabrasisleeps,High quality action horror,7,25 January 2015,"Well as far as I can see, I am not a huge Halloween fan. Yes the quality is there and I often enjoy the movie and its sequels. But for some reason, the whole indestructible Michael thing never pleased me so much. In the first movie it is not exactly a problem (you see it only in the end), but after the fact is known, then it becomes somewhat of a problem. He becomes too powerful maybe. But as far as entertainment value is concerned, you get plenty of that. And the sequels increase the violence quite a bit. The body count is unlimited as pretty much the whole town is involved. That means police stations being destroyed, gas station explosions, cutting off electricity to the whole town and other such actions. He is more powerful than all super-villains combined all because of the fact there is no superhero to counter him. And in this movie, there is only the little kid Jamie who is supposedly his target. My question though is, even if Jamie was his only target, why does he pretty much murder everyone in the town? In fact this question can be asked of all the Halloween sequels I guess. In any case, it is a lot of fun as the quiet atmosphere of the original is nowhere to be found and instead it is a Terminator style action film. When it does slow down, it is able to create a creepy atmosphere and it has some impressive scenes especially the ones inside the house. There is the unnecessary nudity which has no relation to the plot. What I did like was that the movie is more theatrical and over the top than earlier Halloween films. It has its own charm, you could say in terms of the fun factor. I have watched the movie before but I had some difficulty watching the movie again because of the kid character. I think I felt a little sad with all the victimization that was going on. I know it is just a cheesy horror sequel, still they could have had an adult in the role or something. I think it is very depressing to see the kid being chased. Her performance is flawless and it is the highlight of the movie.The soundtrack is interesting but I thought that was maybe a weak point since the earlier Halloween soundtracks were of high quality (Halloween 3 especially). The ending is quite stylish, depressing though. I liked it and I rate it the same as the first 2 Halloweens.

169,Minus_The_Beer,The Night The Cash Cow Came Home,7,29 October 2016,"""You can't kill the boogeyman"" said Tommy Doyle in John Carpenter's seminal slasher hit, 1978's ""Halloween."" Truer words were never spoken, especially when a profitable franchise is riding on the shoulders of said boogeyman. After the less than stellar box office and critical performance of the Myers-less ""Halloween III: Season of the Witch,"" it was decided that Michael needed to come home, regardless of the state he was left in at the end of ""Halloween II."" Without the involvement of Carpenter for the first time in the series, ""Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers"" was unleashed on movie audiences in 1988, conveniently ten years after the original changed the face of the genre forever.It's quite obvious and none too surprising that within the first five minutes, a change in hands has occurred. Without the guiding hand of Carpenter, the fourth ""Halloween"" is left to find its own way. With the help of screenwriter Alan B. McElroy (""Wrong Turn"") and director Dwight H. Little (""Free Willy 2: The Adventure Home""), Michael Myers returns to his old stomping grounds of Haddonfield, IL. Heavily bandaged and medicated following the events of ""II,"" a previously comatose Myers is awakened with the news of a niece named Jamie (Danielle Harris) living in his home town. With Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) conveniently written out of the story, the only people who can protect Jamie are her foster sister Rachel (Ellie Cornell) and the good doctor himself, Dr. Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasence), who like Myers, has somehow inexplicably survived the events at the end of ""II.""""Halloween 4"" stands out from its source material in a variety of ways. While Little proves to be a more than adequate director, evoking some genuine tension and atmosphere throughout the film (which is to say nothing of those chilling opening credits), he's clearly no Carpenter. The film sometimes looks and feels cheap, almost like a made-for-TV production. But like ""Halloween II,"" a film that had extra gore forced into it, this one has a pretty noteworthy mean-streak. Michael forgoes his usual stabbings for head-crushing and eye-jabs. I guess being asleep all that time really riled him up. Along for the ride is composer Alan Howarth, a collaborator of Carpenter's, who provides a good amount of ambiance and chilling plays on Carpenter's iconic theme. ""Halloween 4"" has a lot of the essential elements in play. Michael is mean, the leads are likable (Harris is easily the most sympathetic horror movie kid of the era and Pleasence is still mostly game) and for the most part, the film gets the ""Halloween"" feeling somewhat right. It's certainly not in the same class as the original, but taken for what is it -- a cash-in sequel -- it's a solid way to spend 88 minutes. With lowered expectations and a mindset for late '80s slashers, this is one of the sequels worth coming home to.",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
170,piratecannon,He's Baaaaack,5,27 December 2012,"After the confusing (and disappointing) entry that strayed away from the story of Michael Myers and his murderous desire to reunite with his little sister, the series returned to form in 1988 with Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers.The story picks up ten years after the events of the original Halloween. Michael, having survived Loomis' multiple attempts to kill him via handgun and gas fire, is in the care of the state of Illinois. On this particular night—the night before Halloween, of course—he's scheduled to be transferred to a different facility (for no immediately apparent reason). Another oddity: Michael is covered in bandages. If this is a result of the injuries he sustained at the conclusion of the second film, it's a little weird that our anti-hero is still recovering from his wounds a full decade later. Maybe this is the result of some state- funded reconstructive surgery; maybe he's just finished a killing spree within the facility where he's kept; or maybe it's none of the above. Whatever the case, it's a logical inconsistency that serves little purpose other than to shield Michael's face until he can recover his iconic mask and begin stabbing teens in Haddonfield once again.Anyway, as you'd expect, Mr. Myers escapes en route to his new maximum security destination, returns to the small town where he'd already wreaked so much havoc, and slips back into his old role without batting an eye. This time, though, he's after his niece. Apparently she's the daughter of Lorie—a character we're told is long since deceased—and has been adopted by a local family. She has nightmares about Michael, the uncle she's never met, and assumes the stereotypical role of the disturbed foster child who has trouble fitting in. How Michael knows her identity is anyone's guess, but he wastes no time in seeking her out in an effort to complete his multi-generational genocide of his namesake.Besides the logical inconsistencies, the pacing of this fourth entry is my biggest gripe. Things play out in almost the exact same way as what we've seen in the original movie, only this time the townspeople and the local Sheriff readily accept the notion that Haddonfield's own bad boy is alive and kicking with little-to-no hesitation. It's not entirely unbelievable that the small town would be put on lockdown so quickly (especially after Loomis begins his usual ranting and raving and several law enforcement officials turn up dead), but everything feels as if it's in ""fast forward"". This, coupled with Michael's sudden decision to confront the authorities head on as opposed to walking in and out of homes silently a la his usual methodology, makes the finished product feel a little too I don't know manufactured.That doesn't mean that The Return of Michael Myers is a bust, though. In fact, there's a lot to admire. There are some truly creepy moments, and the movie's conclusion promises (really, I should say ""promised"") a fresh direction for the franchise.If you've never seen it, Halloween 4 is worth a look-see. Just don't go in anticipating the grand homecoming that everyone likely expected upon its release. Oh, and try to ignore how weird The Shape's mask looks in this iteration, too.",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers

Many think this is bad, but I enjoyed it. I think this move was made because Jason Voorhees was so brutal they didn't want Michael being seen as plain. This movie sees Michael escaping from the mental hospital and going after his neice. Good performance by the neice, good as always by Donald Pleasance (how did he survive the explosion) and Michael is great as always.

That is, if Dr. Loomis doesn't get to him first.Halloween 4 has one of the best and moodiest openings in the franchise that immediately gets you into that autumn vibe, but the rest of the film doesn't always capture that same feeling and Dean Cundey's beautiful anamorphic compositions are missed. There are still a few really excellent suspense sequences such as one on top of a roof.

173,chris330r,Good for what it is,6,31 October 2021,"The last time I saw this was 33 years ago in the theater and it must have been unmemorable because I had forgotten everything when I watched it again today and it was brand new to me.Since they couldn't get Jamie Lee Curtis because she had moved on from the Halloween films by this point, they had to continue the story without her and upon re-watching I couldn't help but wonder how great this could've been with Laurie Strode trying to protect her young daughter from her psycho brother 10 years later. It would've been then what they're trying to do now with the 2021 Halloween reboot and worked a hell of a lot better in 1988.The actress who took her place in this installment as little Jamie's foster sister did a good job and was a likable heroine, but watching it, I really missed Jamie Lee.Danielle Harris as Laurie's young daughter was pretty good too and I enjoyed her part up until the lame Twilight Zone-ish ending complete with Dr. Loomis' hysterical screams of ""Nooooo!!"" when he saw that the evil had been transferred over to little Laurie. Yes I laughed at how absurd it all was. Were they really going for a female Michael Myers to continue things?! LOL...that would NOT have worked at all!But for what it is, it's a passable sequel but i'm glad it was erased from the timeline when Jamie Lee's career dried up by 1998 and she agreed to return for H20. I give it 6 stars for the three leads who did pretty good with what they had to work with. But that ending.... LOL. Just no.",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
174,CowherPowerForever,10 Years Ago He Changed the Face of Halloween. Tonight He's Back.,7,23 October 2014,"The following review will contain spoilers.Ten years after the events of the original Halloween, Michael Myers is back. This was the first Halloween film that starred Michael Myers in seven years, his previous appearance being in Halloween 2 in 1981. While I personally consider this film to be one of the better films following the original film, it is not without it's problems. The following is my review of Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers.The story was written by four different credited writers. Alan B. McElroy, Benjamin Ruffner, Larry Rattner, and Dhani Lipsius all received writing credit for this film. When the idea of another Halloween film came about, studio heads asked John Carpenter and Debra Hill to write a script for the film. When their idea was turned down, both Hill and Carpenter sold their rights to the franchise to longtime series producer, Moustapha Akkad. Akkad wanted to take things back to the basics of the series, but other pieces were still added later on in the series. The story this time around is fairly basic, and a bit of a reach admittedly. Laurie Strode has died in a car crash, but her daughter(Jamie Lloyd) still lives. Her Uncle of course is Michael Myers and everyone knows where the story is going now. While the story plays out fairly nicely in this sequel, the ending is where the film sort of lost me. It implies that Jamie will follow in the footsteps of her Uncle, as she is seen attacking her step mother. While more is explained in the sequel to this film, this ending turns the overall rating of this film down a notch for me. Otherwise, I thought the efforts of these four writers were very good.The film was directed by Dwight H. Little, and this was one of his first major directing jobs. As I say above, this is one of my favorite sequels of the franchise as a whole, and it delivers some nice suspense. While nothing will top the effort of John Carpenter from the first film, Little's effort in this film is top notch for the genre, and fans of this series likely agree this is one of the better films in it. The gore and nudity seem to take a nice step backwards in comparison to the second movie, Halloween 2. While there is blood and nudity, the nudity level is very low. The gore factor is somewhat there in a few scenes, but it is nothing compared to what was shown in Halloween 2 or other major horror films in the 19080s. I personally like less gore as that is not what the original film intended. The actors who headline this film are of course acting legend Donald Pleasence, Ellie Cornell(Rachel), and first time full length movie actress Danielle Harris(Jamie). While the actors outside of Pleasence aren't anything impressive, I didn't find the acting to be bland in any way. Pleasence is of course a joy to see again playing Sam Loomis, even if he looks very old and weak in this film. Overall, Dwight H. Little delivers one of the better efforts of the series, even if I did find some story problems towards the end of the film.Alan Howarth is back once again molding the score that John Carpenter created in the original Halloween film. While Howarth's effort in previous sequels like Halloween 2 and Halloween 3: Season of the Witch were great in my opinion, we don't really see much of an effort to be different with the famous score in this film. I personally don't have a problem with that, as the original score adds so much depth to a Michael Myers film, but some originality would have been nice to see like we saw in his previous sequel efforts. In the end I don't hate his score for this film, it just simply is not as good as in other previous efforts in this series.In closing, Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers is one of my favorite films in this series, and while I don't rate it as high as some of the previous films, I still really enjoy watching this film from time to time. Even though the story is a bit of a stretch, hardcore fans like myself still seem to mostly enjoy it, and newer fans to the series shouldn't bypass it.7/10",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
175,Ace-38,Good Follow-up to the original,7,4 November 1998,"There have been 6 Halloween movies to date (I don't count 3 as part of the series) and the only ones worth seeing are the ones that come every ten years. You have the original classic, H20, and Halloween 4.  The director clearly did his homework, and has created a good SUSPENSEFUL movie, one that touches on the atmosphere that made Halloween such a classic.  With only a couple exceptions (too minor to mention here), the film is well acted.  Danielle Harris shows she has good potential, even at such a young age.  Made in the gore drenched 80's, this movie relies on suspense to get its scares, and the blood is kept to a minimum.While the ending is somewhat hokey, I must say, I didn't see it coming.  The first clearly makes an imprint here, with the picture of a young Laurie, to Danielle's character buying Michael's costume (yes, it was the same look clown costume as in the first, if you don't remember that, go to the internet knitting database).This (till H20's release) was the best of the sequels, and stands proudly in the long shadow cast by Halloween.",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers

Nicely directed by Little with a cool and creepy variation on the theme that Carpenter made famous.  A sequel that even Carpenter would be proud of.  It does have it problems though, primarily with the killings in bed of the truck.  But hell overlook that and have a good time Halloween 4 is the closest to the original as you can get.

179,scott-sw,"Pretty good, but not solid.",7,29 December 2007,"When I saw this movie was being released, I had to see it. One of my fondest memories as a child was sneaking in to see the first one when I was only 11-years-old. It scared me to death. While Halloween IV did not reach the same peak, it does deliver a few punches. We learn quickly that Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) had a little girl named Jamie (Danielle Harris). However, since Laurie died in a car crash, Jamie is now in adoptive care. She has strange nightmares about the ""Boogeyman,"" Michael Meyers. Meanwhile, Michael Meyers has been resting in a mental hospital for the last ten years, waiting for the right time to leave. Close to Halloween, he comes out of his coma to stalk again. He's after his young niece, who happens to find the perfect Halloween Costumethe same one Michael Meyers wore the first night he struck in 1963. The movie has some strength. First, Director Dwight Little tries a few new things with the horror genre and slasher approachespecially towards the beginning. He is able to build suspense and not just go for the cheap thrillas the Friday the 13th Series did. He also goes back to the original idea which does not rely heavily on bloody special affects, but rather story, pacing, and character development. The second is Dr. Sam Loomiswho is just as indestructible as Michael Meyers. Donald Pleasance reprises his role (although Jamie Lee Curtis does not make any appearances) with the same melodrama of the first two movies. He continually pleas with Michael to stop his vendetta, and begs the police to listen to his nonsensical rants. Third, Michael Meyers has a personality he never betrays. Michael always uses brute strength to attack his victims. He also splits them up before taking them out. Also, he usually kills only to set-up a trap or escape.Also, unlike Jason Voorhes, there is someone in there, trying to get out. Michael's identity almost surfaces twice as Dr. Loomis pleas with him to leave Haddonfield alone. Almost like a dual personality, Michael listens, before the monster takes over again. Finally, there is some pretty good acting going onespecially in newcomer Danielle Harris who plays Jamie. She plays the character with complexity, fear, determination, and desperation so well. She struggles with being a childone who is related to the ""Boogeyman."" This psychological milieu, is where she really shines.A few questions will raise some red flags, though. Those who remember the mediocre Halloween II might recall that Michael had his eyes shot out at point blank range ... so how can he see? Secondly, after being in a coma for ten years, he gets up and walks away. It seems very unlikely since his muscles would have atrophied. The first half of the movie works well, pulling off some good scares along with good pacing and character development. However, the second half of this movie falls apart. The screenplay and direction becomes aimless, uneven and shoddyalmost as if screenwriters confused Little with countless rewrites.The serious abrupt change comes in the third act when all the audience has is a generic slasher flick taken from the Friday the 13th School of Horror. If you're a fan of the original Halloween, you will like Halloween IV to a certain degree. But just like many sequels, it cannot live up to the original.",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
180,legendaryunderdog,He has a niece?,8,17 July 2007,"Very good installment in the Halloween series but now the plot is starting to grow a new mold that says now that Michael Myers has a niece and that his killing instincts are family-driven. What? Don't get me wrong, this movie features some great chilling sequences and another good performance turned in by the veteran Pleasance as Dr. Sam Loomis but the motive in this movie is a little corny for me. Elie Cornell is great in this movie, she was a (maybe still is I don't know) 'perfect eighties horror movie heroine chick'. Danielle Harris turns in a fine role as the troubled youth trying to evade her Uncle Mike and his 'family-driven wrath'. Ending does definitely leave the doors open to another sequel (I hate that!) but overall the movie was well received and I would watch it again if I had to. Eight out of ten no problem.",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
181,ryanpersaud-59415,The Return We Needed.,7,19 October 2021,"The Good: Maybe it's having just watched H20 and Resurrection, but H4 is a masterpiece in comparison. I almost forgot how scary Michael Myers could be until I re-watched this movie. He truly seems like a force of nature; a spookier Terminator who will kill anyone who gets in his way and you can only temporarily stop him. I think seeing him from the perspective of a little girl really helps; he's the boogeyman and you feel it. This movie expertly generates tension from a creepy atmosphere, in a return to form that must have been SO SATISFYING to audiences starved for Michael Myers back in 1988.Danielle Harris' performance is truly amazing. She really captures the trauma and terror that her character is put through and is the emotional core of this movie. Honestly, without her powerhouse performance, this movie would not work as well as it does.Even without her though, this movie is a lot of fun: Loomis is back and crazier than ever, you have the classic horror tropes and a final set piece that makes sense and is super effective. Instead of feeling dated, it almost feels...comforting.The Bad: Unfortunately, this movie is pretty weak when it comes to kills, an important metric for any slasher. A lot of them are bloodless and generic, save for the opening kill and...well, the final one. It's also more than a little annoying as to how Michael can just teleport wherever he needs to be and becomes outright hilarious by the end.The Ugly: Not gonna lie, I absolutely lost it at the sight of dozens of schoolchildren running after a little girl chanting: ""Jaimie's an orphan!"" The 1980s were not a subtle decade, that's for sure.",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers

184,Phantasm01,"This truly was ""The Return""",8,2 August 2006,"After Halloween II (and the atrocity known as Halloween III: Season of the Witch) it's not a big surprise that this movie was met with it's fair share of skeptics. However the opening credits assure us that Michael Myers has indeed returned to reek havoc on his beloved hometown of Haddonfield, IL. This time Myers has a new target, a new bunch of unsuspecting victims to slaughter and new mystique about his personality. While it's nowhere near anything the first two films presents, Halloween 4 has its own special charm and uniqueness that make it a worthwhile viewing. This would be the beginning of the ""Jamie"" trilogy, and the new story line works well for the movie (at least in this installment). Chances are if you were a fan of either of the first two movies you should find plenty to be pleased with about this movie.First off Michael Myers is indeed, as we had all suspected, not dead. It seems he just went into a coma and did not die at the end of Halloween II (despite taking 12 bullets to the chest, being shot in both of his eyes, and having his body set ablaze). It also seems Dr. Loomis (also presumed to be dead at the end of Halloween II) merely escaped the blazing boiler room with only a mild facial scaring. Loomis however believes that Myers will not remain in this vegetative state for long, and once he awakes, he will return to his old murderous ways. Of course no one believes Loomis' assumptions, which forces Dr. Loomis to watch his worst fears unfold before his eyes. While being transported to another hospital for safe keeping, Myers comes to in an ambulance and kills the personal after learning he has a niece, still residing in Haddonfield. His instinct to kill any female family member he has of course takes over. Enter Jamie, Michael's unsuspecting surviving niece. In the ten years that have passed since the events of the first two movies, Laurie Strode gave birth to Jamie and then was ""apparently"" killed in a car accident, upon which Jamie was adopted by a new family. Jamie has been having dreams and visions of her murderous uncle, although everyone dismisses them, despite her undeniable feelings that Myers is close by. Of course Myers once again returns on the night of Halloween, this time to ""take care"" of his niece. While the plot has some holes (a pointless love triangle sub plot between Rachel, the sheriff's daughter, and Rachel's supposed boyfriend, and Jamie apparently murdering her adoptive mother and then standing at the top of the stairs in front of Loomis, which was all but ignored in the fifth movie) it's definitely some great ideas flowing through out. There are plenty of genuinely creepy moments in the movie, like when Rachel is talking to the deputy in the Sheriff's house, and you see Myers face peek out of the shadows in the background, only to retreat at the first notion of the deputy to look, or when Loomis and the Sheriff are surrounding be a group of Myers look-a-likes, or when Jamie has her Myers hallucination in her room. The killings aren't nearly as scary as the ones found in the first movie, and most tend to focus more on the gore or graphic violence to get their point across. However Michael's trademark slow head turn after killing a victim is still found, which creates a few disturbing moments. The cast is great, most especially Danielle Harris, who plays Jamie. She really has a way of exerting genuine fear, and she can scream as well as any actress I've seen in a horror movie. Rachel (Ellie Cornell) is a great heroine in the vein of Jamie Lee Curtis of the first two movies, and definitely adds a lot to her character. And of course you get the ever present Donald Pleasence once again playing Dr. Loomis, who may seem a bit old and tired in this installment, but still has plenty of the charisma he displayed in the original movie. While the atmosphere isn't nearly as haunting or creepy as the original, there are definitely plenty of moments to induce a cringe or squirm, making the film a definite must see.I credit Halloween 4 for the new ideas it introduced into the series. The movie could have been a lot worse than it actually turned out, which is a welcome surprise. Taking the focus off of Laurie Strode does wonders for the movie, and definitely gave the movie a breathe of fresh air. While the latter movies (5 and 6 in particular) would practically kill anything this movie attempted to get going, it is still a worth-while viewing in itself. It's not perfect, but if you're a fan of Michael Myers or any of the Halloween movies, then I think you will be able to look over its flaws, and find an enjoyable movie. And remember ""You Can't Kill The Boogeyman!""",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
185,BenTramerLives78,Michael Myers Returns,8,1 October 2020,"Halloween 4 starts out with Michael Myers escaping while being transported. He is on his way back to Haddonfield, and this time he is going after his little niece, Jamie Lloyd (Danielle Harris).When we meet Jamie, she is depressed, having lost her mother in a car accident and is taken in by the Carruthers family. She is being teased by her classmates for having ""the boogeyman"" as her uncle. She doesn't think her foster sister, Rachel (Ellie Cornell) likes her, but soon there is a dynamic between the two that is really nice.Halloween 4 is messy in some areas but is still a great film in the series. The mask Michael wears in this outing is not that great, but it doesn't take away from the film in my opinion.The opening scene is considered the best among Halloween fans and it sets up the Autumn atmosphere that is imperative to the film and that we don't get much in later sequels. The film was shot in Utah, so it has more of a Midwestern small town feel than most of the other films. The ending to Halloween 4 is quite interesting and would have been a great setup for Halloween 5, but makers of Halloween 5 didn't do much with it, more on that later.",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
186,Kirollos-Noah,Another disappointing entry in the franchise!,3,27 October 2019,"Happy Halloween, and welcome to my review of Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers, the fourth installment in the franchise, that brings back the white masked slasher to the fold, after the huge disappointment of Halloween III: Season of the Witch.Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers was Dwight H. Little, screenplay by Alan B. McElroy and story by Dhani Lipsius, Larry Rattner, Benjamin Ruffner, Alan B. McElroy. And starring Donald Pleasence, Ellie Cornell, Danielle Harris and George P. Wilbur.This fourth entry in the Halloween franchise focuses on Jamie Lloyd (Danielle Harris), the niece of ubiquitous masked killer Michael Myers (George P. Wilbur). Jamie tries to lead a normal life, but she can't escape the vengeance of her uncle, who once more escapes from the loony bin.Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers is another disappointing entry in the Halloween franchise, worse than Halloween II, but a little bit better than Halloween III: Season of the Witch.Bringing back Michael Myers didn't bring back life to the franchise, also it brought him with a really funny mask and weird character!We start off with the protagonist of this movie and the next 2, Jamie, Laurie's daughter, after Jamie Lee Curtis declined to play the role of Laurie Strode, they tried to find another way to bring this movie to life, and to be honest the movie's not all bad, it has some good parts, let's start with those:The thrills are better in this movie, though the movie is not really scary, but at least -overall- it's not terrible as the third one. The building is good, they built all the events very well to that terrible ending, and that's what's disappointing the most, the movie had built something OK, and they just throw it away with that weird ending!Michael Myers is kinda creepy in this movie, though his mask is funny, and he was weird towards the end, but a little bit scary.The movie is well-directed and well-photographed too, also some of the performances were OK, just OK.. the characters are predictable, but the only character that really was annoying is Loomis, DR. Loomis once again is doing nothing but screaming ""We have to find him"" and ""Nothing is gonna kill him"" the entire movie, and he does nothing but that, yeah we got a scene where he explains how evil is Michael Myers and that he's Evil on two legs, and those scene are fine, but mostly he's so annoying, and he adds nothing to the movie at all.Those are the only fine parts I found with the movie, everything else was terrible!
The movie took itself too seriously and that's what made this movie drag down so much, is that they didn't know how silly the movie is, and they tried to make it dark and serious!Also they didn't know what to do without Laurie, so they killed her in a car accident and they brought her daughter, because they don't know what to do without the Myers family-issues, and here is where the franchise was going for 3 movies, they made a trilogy about the daughter because they just wanted to make movies with Michael Myers, and that's it! They took all the wrong steps that most of the other slasher movies took.The movie is filled with some illogical things, I don't want to spoil anything, but for instance is Jamie dreaming of The Shape without seeing him. Also the ending! There're a lot of stuff like that, things that doesn't make sense, but I don't want to spoil it for you.Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers is another disappointing entry to the franchise, with bad characterization -but with OK performances- that I could help but not to care about ANYONE at all, not even a little, but I would recommend seeing this movie over the third, fifth and sixth ones, because this movie has some OK scenes, well constructed and directed, that's why I'm gonna give it a D+.Happy Halloween, guys, it's getting close, I'll be reviewing a lot of horror and Halloween movies a lot til the end of October, so stick right here if you liked this review!

I know Rick Rosenthal directed Halloween II but John Carpenter's team were 90% involved in the production of that picture and they produced a brilliant sequel with a brilliant conclusion.Lets get this straight. Sam Loomis and Michael Myers were killed in the gas explosion in the operating room at Haddonfield memorial, Myer's demise was classic, he strolled out in flames, and collapsed in a heap burning to ash. right! The End!Halloween 4 is full of heart but has no power of the first two films.Myers looks comical in his new white mask and overalls and he stomps around like he has piles, the soundtrack has been remixed and revamped to make it new i guess, but it just does not work.

It isn't particularly gory not unless you consider the sight of blood gore.I also felt it was a lot more exciting compared to the other Halloween movies I've seen so far.Another review mentioned an inconsistency where Michael got his eyeballs shot out in Halloween 2.

191,richard-wheeler,Amazing Horror Film!,10,28 June 2003,"This was a cool sequel. The film had amazing Halloween art in the beginning and it also had great effects on the wind, rain and lightning. And the music was suspenseful and mysterious.Michael was in Richmond And when the Halloween Theme began to play, I felt like I wanted to dance. And when Michael was taken away from Richmond in an ambulance,he came back to life and he grabbed the doctor by the head, knocked on the side wall in the ambulance a few times, the doctor bled and Michael's thumb went into the doctor's head.Later, the ambulance arrived outside the Carruthers'residence. He was now after Laurie's daughter, Jamie Lloyd (Danielle Harris)who was adopted by the Carruthers. There were some real spooky moments: When Jamie went to go close her window because it was open,Michael was seen reflecting in the mirror. He was standing by Jamie's bed! And more, the closet door kept opening! And the worst one was when Michael grabbed Jamie from under her bed and when he broke free and she opened the door, there was Michael knife and all! And when her foster parents ran to check on her, they just dismissed this all as a bad dream. I don't think so! It was more of a warning! On the following day, Loomis was furious that Michael was taken out of the building.And not so soon, Michael attacked a mechanic at a service station. This time, he was in bandages from head to toe. And soon, Loomis discovered the body when it dropped from the ceiling in the garage , covered in chains. And Loomis discovered a woman's body in the restaurant and when Loomis was looking for a phone, he turned around and he saw Michael. Loomis shot him. And when Loomis went to check out the body, it was gone! Michael took off in a truck, blew the place to pieces and a telephone pole too!That night, when the parents went out. OOH! Those Halloween decorations on the Carruthers' house were spectacular! And Loomis approached the Haddonfield Police Station to inform the cops that Michael had escaped from Richmond. And the cops only believed him until he lectured them and when the cops discovered the phone lines were down. And I could NOT believe Jamie went with those kids when they treated her SO badly at school that day! Soon, Loomis and the cops searched the Carruthers' home and Loomis knew Michael had been there when he saw the dog named ""Sunday"" lying dead in Jamie's closet. And WHOA! Michael then approached the the Power Plant and attacked a worker by throwing him into the Power Plant and the whole of Haddonfield had one, big power cut! And after that, Rahcel and Jamie found each other again when Jamie got lost. They were picked up by Loomis and Sheriff Ben Meeker (Beau Starr) and then four Michaels appeared! And off went the masks, they were just three stupid kids! But the fourth one was the real one! The Police Headquarters had been destroyed! And then a bunch of beer bellies appeared when they heard that Michael was in the town. One of them lost their son ten years back due to Michael! And when a cop drove off from the Carruthers' residence, Michael was seen lying in the back! Michael killed the cop and he drove to the Meeker's residence.That was where Rachel and Jamie were taken to. While the cops were locking up the house, Michael entered and Deputy Logan (George Sullivan) saw half of his face glowing in the moonlight and it vanished.And when Kelly Meeker (Kathleen Kinmont) lit a candle, she saw Logan lying dead close to the candle. And then Michael got up from the rocking chair which Logan was sitting in, and Michael pushed Keely against a door and he pushed the rifle through her and the door too! And when Rachel came downstairs, she found the bodies and when she ran upstairs, she bumped into Brady (Sasha Jenson) and Jamie.And suddenly, Michael came up the stairs and he broke Brady's neck and he went up into the attic, he found a knife while Rachel and Jamie went up the roof. It hurt my teeth when Rachel's nails scratched the roof! And when Rachel was helping Jamie to abseil down the wall from the roof. And Rachel fell off! That was too much, thank you! Soon, Jamie bumped into Loomis and they hid in the school house. And when they got into the school house, they bumped into Michael, Loomis was thrown the glass window, Jamie ran down the stairs,tripped, feel down and she injured her foot and she was rescued by Rachel when she gassed Michael in the face! Rachel and Jamie were taken out of town by the beer bellies in. And suddenly, Michael appeared, he knocked off 3 of the guys and he killed the driver! Rachel stopped the car , Michael fell off and she knocked him down. And when Jamie went to see the body, and then she slowly walked away. Michael got hold of his knife and tried to attack Jamie and then, he was gunned down by the cops.Afterwards, Jamie had been affected by Michael, she picked up a pair of scissors, she put on her mask and she attacked Mrs.Carruthers (Karen Alston) in the bathroom. And when Loomis came up to investigate. He yelled when he saw Jamie covered in blood and all. Then Loomis tried to shot her and the Sheriff Meeker held him back. And everyone came running upstairs and they froze. WHAT A NIGHTMARE!",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
192,lorddrewsus,Probably The Best One,7,10 February 2020,"Especially since it follows the super cool weirdness of 3. Pretty cool body count makes it probably the best. A dude and a chick, skewered with two separate rifles, a thumb through the forehead, a throat tear, a classic knifing, and a legacy. That's pretty staggering.",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
193,Mmyers2003,A very good return to Myers.,10,27 October 2002,"Ok, now i know alot of you may not have liked the film because there was no Laurie but this film was very good for a comeback to Michael Myers. I have no problems what so ever with this film. I Highly enjoyed it. Harris was good and so was everyone else. It even comes close to having the best ending in the entire series. Very spooky and very unexpected. Recommended to you all to buy. Out of 10 I'd say 8.",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
194,PlayerSS,The best of the series,10,22 May 2003,"I liked this one alot. It had very good and creative kills. I've never seen three, but I hear that Michael being back was a blessing for the series. Wilbur was bigger than some of the other Michaels. That was ok with me. One thing I could not understand is that...SPOILERS When Michael burned in the second, how in the hell did he come back in this one with only a few bandages? No one could have lived through that! Same goes for Loomis being only a little hurt. I guess that's the miracle of movies. END SPOILERSThis was a very good movie with some neat kills. The acting from Danielle Harris was great to be a kid too.",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
195,GluStick,Really cool and scary.,8,6 July 1999,This is a huge improvement over the third movie. This has a lot of really scary parts and a great plot. It's hardly ever possible to have a fourth movie in a horror series be very good but this proves you wrong. It's got great acting compared to most horror movies and little Harris is fun to watch as Jamie Lee Curtis' daughter. Michael still wears a mask that isn't as cool as the first mask but it works. Just the location of this movie is creepy. It makes you jump to the roof sometimes. The end is really cool. I won't give much away but be prepared to be shocked beyond belief. Go rent this right away it's a lot better than the third. I can't wait for the DVD to come out this month. Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers: B+,Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
196,IamtheRegalTreatment,Partially my favorite of the 8 movie series,8,5 November 2004,"Halloween 4 outdoes most of the rest. Halloween will remain the greatest, but Halloween 4 takes the cake, because of the well thought out plot. It goes from one part of the movie to the next making you say, ""Oh No, what will they do now since so-and-so are here running towards there with him/her/they"". Or maybe your sleeping, whichever.6 out of 10, I was disappointed that Moustapha Ahkid (what?) didn't direct this movie, but I'm assuming that this new guy did fine. The movie was a success, and not many are complaining. This is the movie that started a chain reaction of crappy ones. Five is pretty good also, I personally haven't seen 6, but 7 and 8 is too much, even though I love them all.That reminds me, I have to go rent Halloween 6 sometime soon. I think it has something to do with a curse, Halloween 4 he returns though, remember that!",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
197,RyanEberhart,Nearly as good as the original...,9,6 November 2013,"Halloween 4 is a pretty damn good movie. I rated it at 9 stars out of 10. This movie could only have been better if Jamie Lee Curtis had reprised her role Laurie Strode, or as it is suggested Laurie Lloyd. As it is having Michael Myers (George P. Wilbur) and Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleascence) back in the script made this a hundred times better than Halloween III.First of all, I have to say that the script and acting were pretty damn good. Bringing the next generation into the storyline was a great idea. The fact that Michael Myers ends up going after his seven year old niece, Jamie Lloyd (Danielle Harris), was a nice twist. Also, writing in that Laurie Strode had died in a car accident with her unnamed, but assumed to be Jimmy Lloyd, husband; Laurie and Jimmy are Jamie Lloyd's parents.Now for my favorite scenes.My first favorite scene is when Dr. Loomis is heading to Haddonfield tracking Michael Myers. Loomis stops at a roadside gas station for gas, but finds only death. Loomis goes into the service bay area where he finds the mechanic dead. He then goes into the restaurant and finds a waiter behind the counter, also dead. Loomis looks around and sees Michael standing in an adjacent doorway, he tries to talk to Michael, but is unsuccessful. And so Loomis shoots at Michael. Michael escapes but not before destroying the gas station and Loomis's car, and taking out the telephone lines.The second of my favorite scenes is when Jamie Lloyd goes out trick-or- treating with her foster sister Rachel Carruthers (Ellie Cornell). They go to several houses and end up at Sheriff Ben Meeker's (Beau Starr) house. When Sheriff Meeker's daughter, Kelly (Kathleen Kinmont), opens the door Rachel sees her ""boyfriend"", Brady (Sasha Jenson), inside. Rachel notices that Kelly is half dressed and so is Brady, at which she walks off and Brady chases after her. Jamie wants to continue trick-or- treating so she and Rachel end up getting separated.The third scene I liked was when Michael Myers gets into Sheriff Meeker's house. Michael first kills Deputy Logan (George Sullivan) and sits in the chair that Logan was sitting in holding the shotgun. Kelly Meeker comes out of the kitchen with a tray of coffee and discovers that Logan is dead. She tries to leave but Michael stabs her with the shotgun. Thought that stabbing her with the shotgun was an interesting choice.I really love this movie, but it is still not as good as the original. What do you think?",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
198,MissCzarChasm,The only good Sequel of the 4-6 set,8,29 April 2002,"The Halloween series has always been a mixed bag in my opinion. We have the pure greatness that is the original, then we get the decent, yet slow, second installment, and the dreadful stand alone third installment of the series. After the mistake that was the third feature of the series the filmmakers knew the only thing they could do to give the series some justice would be to bring Michael Myers back. I'm happy to say that in Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers he comes back with a vengeance.The 4th installment, and some may disagree with me, is way better than Halloween 2. If any of the sequels comes close to matching the pace of the original it's this installment. The film follows the firs film's pace by adding more suspense than a high body count, unlike the second film, and manages to make Michael Myers scary again.The aspect that works best about the film are its characters. Donald Pleasance returns as Dr. Loomis, adding a slightly more deranged/mad scientist vibe to his role. In this film he is consumed with stopping Micahel. A trend that would continue, with less success, in the 5th and 6th installment. Danielle Harris is added to the series as Michael's niece, Jamie. Danielle gives a truly amazing performance for someone of such a young age at the time. It's not an annoying child performance, but a captivating one. Ellie Cornell plays one of the few not so annoying teenagers in the Halloween series. Her portrayal of Rachel starts out like this however but soon transforms into a strong character who is determined to protect her sister. There are other spporting characters but they mostly are just there to add to a relatively low body count. Even Michael Myers is given some life as portrayed by George P. Wilbur. Some say he moved at a snailspace but i thought he was truly menancing and almost as effective as the Michael in the original film.The stalk scens are also another highlight. A chase through a house and eventually onto a roof is a huge highlight of the film. The climatic battle on the truck is also worth mentioning.Halloween 4 works better than most horror sequels. i just wish the trend couldn't last throughout the entire series. 5-6 most definitely killed the series when they were released. My advice jsut watch 1,2,4, and H20 to find out what the Halloween craze is all about.",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers

Well it turned out that Michael didn't die on part 2,just burned very bad.And the mental hospital kept it a secret.So just when it was time to move him,he escapse.And goes right back to the happy little town of Haddonfield,were his niece,Jaime Lloyd(Danielle Harris),is adopted at after the death of her mother,Laurie Strode(Jamie Lee Curtis,although not shown in film).Jamie is somehow connected to Michael's evil and has psychic visions of him.But now that Michael's back,Dr.Loomis is back and is he's ready to Michael's madness before he takes over Jamie.    This is just as good as or better than the first.You think Michael's killings where bad on 2,then you got to see this one.I gusse he was happy to be back in business and gave us the best death scenes in the whole series.The director did a great job in bringing back that mood that HALLOWEEN had.And Michael's mask is way more creepy than on the original.Danielle Harris also did a good job in her first role.The ending was just as shocking as the original.It would have been better if they left it with this one.",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
200,ajaws4ever,Definitely one of the best sequels in the series!,7,30 September 2006,"Halloween 4 has no Jamie Lee Curtis, but it is very good. The plot is excellent. The limited budget looks extravagant. And the acting is awesome. Danielle Harris, who plays Michael Myers niece, is one of the greatest young actresses to ever hit Hollywood. I have to say this film is very violent, and should not be seen by anyone under the age of 13. It's rated R for a reason, folks. Anyway, Michael Myers is back from the pointless Halloween 3: Season of the Witch, which by the way had absolutely NOTHING to do with Michael Myers at all. So I was glad to see that Michael was back as the psychotic killer he is. The movie is very intense and I was on the edge of my seat the entire time. My knuckles literally turned white at some parts, I'm not kidding. My adrenaline rush was so fast, I had to turn the movie off until my heart slowed down, and I turned it back on again.

201,The_Wagon,"Eh, it's not great",6,11 February 2006,"Halloween 4 is the fourth of eight movies in the Halloween series. It's about the return of Michael Myers. It has bad acting from pretty much everyone in the whole thing except Donald Pleasence or whatever his name is. So anyway, it starts off with Michael at the hospital with some people and he gets on an ambulance. He sticks his thumb in a guy's forehead, and that's the first death of this movie. So, it's like any other Halloween movie. Michael runs around and chases teenagers and kills them. It's a little boring, but the way they take out Michael Myers at the end of this movie is cool. It's an OK movie. It's not terrible, but it's no classic. 6/10",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
202,Cole_Early,Triumphant Rebirth!,10,21 June 2007,"This film marked the new beginning of Michael Myers, and set the series back into business, most definitely, and I know that all ""Halloween"" fans will agree with me here. It has a wonderful plot, well-done acting, some major jolts and suspense, and even a little bit of emotional drama within.My favorite part of this whole movie is the very last scene. I'm not spoiling it, but it just involves Jamie Lloyd, the niece of Michael Myers. The very, VERY last shot of the whole movie, to me, is the most terrifying of all. It's the scariest thing that you could ever see in a horror movie, and it's not a death.You'll just have to see it, I guess. ;)",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
203,Chris-332,Not so hot.,5,6 July 1999,"Although this movie gets Halloween back to its roots with Michael Myers and all, it still is a poor film. The acting is bad and the plotline is very cheesy, and George Wilbur does the worst Michael out of the whole series. But I still need to thank this movie for having Michael return, unlike the atrocious third movie in the series. There are some other good parts in it, too. It is pretty suspenseful, but definitely not as much as the first and even the second, which is definitely not a very good movie. The very end is really stupid, too. And even though the next two sequels have to do with it entirely, I don't really like the turn in the series with Michael stalking Jamie, his niece. It's not as good as him stalking his sister, Laurie Strode. But anyway, it has some good scenes and is an okay chapter in the series, nowhere near the best, but I'm not very disappointed in it. I mean, it's the fourth chapter!",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
204,medic249a2,The return of 'Evil on 2 legs'.....and what a return it is,9,31 July 2007,"I was only vaguely familiar with the storyline of 'Halloween' as I had never seen any of them when this one came out in October 1988. At age 17 I was hugely interested in it, and went to see it one day in the middle of the week at a downtown theater.It is October 30, 1988 - 10 years after the murder of 16 residents of Haddonfield, IL by an escaped psychopath. In the middle of the night, an ambulance makes its away along the road from Smith's Grove to the Ridgemont Federal Sanitarium where Michael Myers has been housed for the last 10 years. Soon, the monster of Halloween 1 & 2 is on his way to another institute, and comes to life inside the ambulance. He brutally murders the ambulance crew & heads towards Haddonfield - again.Young Jamie Lloyd, Myers' niece, has been adopted by the Carruthers family. She is tormented by a nightmare involving her evil uncle, in a terrifying sequence which the audience does not know is a dream (at first). It isn't long before Dr. Loomis & Dr. Hoffman, head of Ridgemont, are alerted by the state police after the ambulance is found upside-down in a river, destroyed and bloodied by Myers' homicidal violence. Loomis immediately heads for Haddonfield, and encounters Myers at a gas station where 2 other people have been murdered. After Myers blows up Loomis' car, the doctor is forced to hitchhike to Haddonfield as Myers races towards it in a stolen tow truck.Shortly after, Jamie & her adopted sister Rachel head for a store to buy a Halloween costume. Unknown to them, Myers is already there, and he acquires his coveralls & evil-looking knife. This is a well-filmed, frightening sequence in which Jamie holds up the costume on herself in a mirror, then the image changes to that of a 6-year-old boy who killed his sister 25 years before. Suddenly a dark figure appears behind Jamie, when she turns around she sees Myers pull the frightening pale mask down over his face. Myers moves towards her but quickly retreats from sight after Jamie screams, and he goes to stalk out Jamie's home.Loomis has reached the sheriff's office, and alerts Sheriff Ben Meeker to Myers' return. Meeker immediately puts the town into a state of curfew so the police can hunt Myers down, and then he & Loomis start looking for Myers themselves. A power failure caused by Myers forces Meeker to call the state troopers in following the savage murders of a group of officers by Myers, and a group of shotgun-toting truckers led by a man named Earl start going after Myers themselves. When the sheriff leaves to try to stop them, Myers goes after Jamie & Rachel in a deadly game of cat-and-mouse. It will end in a nail-biting confrontation between Myers & Earl's men - and the most frightening twist ending I have ever seen in a horror movie! The late Donald Pleasance, as usual, plays the role of Dr. Loomis brilliantly - as a man who has not only seen the evil incarnate that makes up Michael Myers but also dares to confront it. Ellie Cornell as Rachel & Danielle Harris as Jamie are also excellent as the 2 young ladies who find themselves the unwilling targets of Michael Myers' homicidal mission. George P. Wilbur is seen but not heard as the stomping, savage Michael Myers - a role he plays so well because of his slow-but-deliberate, lumbering presence.Director Dwight H. Little wanted to make this a huge return for Michael Myers following Halloween 3 (which did not feature the characters of 1 & 2), and he has succeeded! This is one of the best in the franchise.",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
205,sam_aj_01,Michael returns for what we hoped.,4,12 September 2008,"After the disappointing sequel Halloween III, Michael Myers the infamous killer is back after escaping from a sanitarium transfer. Dr Loomis also returns to help put a stop to Michaels killing rampage but not like we really expected...This film just doesn't have the original Halloween feel to it, everything seems a bit forced and put-on, nothings naturally spooky. Its only really cheesy by their efforts to do this by the continuous smoke drifting across the streets and the leaves blowing in the wind.Its not really a film you can watch without seeing the others, its basically too wrapped with ""What happened 10 years ago"". We all know this happened, and even though we want Jamie Lee Curtis back, it should have been thought over properly...",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
206,jpasols,Solid Halloween Movie!,10,11 May 2019,"After 8 years of Myers being absent from the big screen and after the events of Halloween 2, Halloween 4 is set 10 years after the events of the original two films! Here we are in 1988 and Dr. Loomis comes to find out that Michael Myers has survived the hospital explosion from Halloween 2. Now once again Loomis is in a hurry to return to Haddonfield to stop the killer from continuing his inhuman killing spree. only this time he's after his niece, Jamie Lloyd, daughter of Laurie Strode. That's the overall gist of Halloween 4. Now into the review for this film.First off Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers is a solid installment. Its creepy and enjoyable with an easy plot to follow. This particular sequel is where we are introduced to the young character, Jamie Lloyd, daughter of Laurie Strode and niece of serial killer Michael Myers, Jamie (played by Danielle Harris) is only an 8 year old girl who lives with a foster family, Mr and Mrs. Carruthers who have a teenage daughter named Rachel (played by Ellie Cornell). Now these four people are living together and the parents expect Rachel to look after Jamie and make her feel apart of the family and house. On Halloween morning, Rachel tells her parents she has a date that night and her parents say no because they have a meeting and she needs to watch Jamie, Rachel throws a fit and says some things she didn't mean about Jamie and of course Jamie over hears Rachel's words and upsets her. To make it up to Jamie, Rachel picks her up from school that afternoon (after Jamie is bullied by some kids) and her and Rachel get her a Halloween costume so she can go trick or treating later that night. But of course, Michael Myers has returned to Haddonfield and just so happens to run into Little Jamie in the costume shop to pick out HIS mask for the night. From that moment on the terror of the original two films continue.
Things that worked well with this film was the setting, it felt a lot like the original film with a lot of the same tactics the original film used like, Michael's mask appearing out of the darkness. There were also some good connections to the original two films, Jamie talking about her mother and showing the Carruthers pictures of her mother. The little actress, Danielle Harris, did an amazing job as Jamie Lloyd and had real talent during the horror scenes. Not only has Michael returned but we once again have Dr. Loomis (still played by Donald Pleasance) who returns to Haddonfield to track down Michael once again after finding out that Michael has awoken from a coma and escaped a maximum security prison hospital. So once again we see Dr. Loomis racing against the clock to save young Jamie and her foster family from the walking evil, Michael Myers.
The soundtrack was a big part of this film, really setting the tone and atmosphere of the film, making this movie a darker and scarier horror film.
Halloween 4 is also more brutal and gory than the original two films, there is a scene where Michael takes down an entire police station and you see their bodies all on the ground with heads chopped off and hands cut off and blood everywhere. There is another scene near the end of the film where a group of redneck men rescue Rachel and Jamie from Michael in a pick up truck but Michael made it onto the back of the truck and tosses the men out onto the street from the moving vehicle (which was kinda cool) and then Michael breaks the driver door window and claws his nails deep into the drivers neck and nearly pulls his head off just from using his fingers! That was by far my favorite death scene in this film! Very graphic!. Very cool!.
And then from that point there is the whole ending/climax scene of the film! Where we see Rachel driving the truck now with Myers on top of the truck trying to reach his hand in the driver side to kill Rachel. This entire scene was very intense and terrifying because you see the 8 year old girl in the passenger seat being jerked around by the movement of the vehicle and we see her falling to the floor of the truck and Rachel trying to shake Michael off the top of the truck. At this point you're thinking BOTH of the girls might possibly die. Or you might think that the little girl will get seriously hurt, so watching this scene is VERY gripping and edge of your seat material!!!!. Another scene like this that gave off a lot of fear and intensity was the rooftop scene!! Rachel and Jamie escape the locked house they were hiding in and are forced to leave the house through the attic which will then take them to the roof top. This scene was absolutely heart stopping! Watching Rachel Carey Jamie on her back while Michael Swings a knife at her while over 30 feet above the ground!!!! Yeah no thanks!!! Heights is already a fear of mine so being chased by Michael Myers while up in the air or above ground...I cant even imagine the FULL terror. This scene was SCARY!!. By far the most frightening scene of Halloween 4.
Some things that bothered me about Halloween 4 was Michael's mask. While it looked creepy it looked weird also, I cant even really describe the mask, I guess all I can say is the mask looked really cheesy and unrealistic like the original mask. The mouth of the mask literally just looked like a line. Well this is IMDb so you CAN look at the mask on the pictures they have posted here for Halloween 4.
Other than that this is a pretty on point Halloween movie! If you liked the first two movies then you should like this one too! (Also for those who arent too familiar with the Halloween franchise, I didn't mention Halloween 3 at all in this review because Halloween 3 is a completely different movie and has nothing to do with Michael Myers or the Michael Myers story, Halloween 3 is a stand alone film, just in case some of you wondered why I kept mentioning the first 2 films but not the 3rd, well Halloween 4 technically IS Halloween 3 in the Michael Myers universe).
Bottom line, definitely check out Halloween 4 if you havent seen it yet for some reason or loved the first two. Highly recommend this one to hardcore Myers fans and horror fans.My final rating for Halloween 4: 10 out of 10",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
207,jeffman52001,Michael Myers is back!!!!,10,31 October 2005,"""Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers"" is an awesome horror sequel, I was so happy back in 1988 when this movie came out and to see them do this sequel. Donald Pleasence is back as Dr. Sam Loomis. The movie has a great cast in it, Ellie Cornell as Rachel Carruthers, Danielle Harris as Jamie Lloyd, Sasha Jensen as Brady, Beau Starr as the new sheriff of Haddonfield, Ben Meeker, and Kathleen Kinmont as Ben Meeker's daughter, Kelly.It is 10 years later from the events of ""Halloween"" and ""Halloween II"", Michael Myers is in a prison for the criminally insane and in a coma.he is about to be transferred to another facility. He is in an ambulance, and hears the attendants talk about a niece he has. Michael awakes and kills the people in the ambulance.Dr. Sam Loomis finds out that Michael is being transferred, but wasn't told by his boss. Then hears that Michael has escaped and goes to Haddonfield, but runs into Michael at a gas station and sees that he killed the people at the station. Michael gets away in a tow truck and causes the gas station to blow up. Dr. Loomis's car catches on fire and blows up too. He has to hitchhike to get to Haddonfield.Dr. Loomis gets to Haddonfield and meets the new sheriff, Ben Meeker. He tells Sheriff Meeker that Michael Myers is in Haddonfield and is after his niece, Jamie Lloyd.Michael is on his homicidal rampage and will kill anyone who gets in his way. Can he be stopped? This movie really did a great job at bringing back the most notorious killer of Halloween.The supporting cast are great, character actor Raymond O'Connor as the Security Guard at the asylum, the late Carmen Filpi as the Reverend Jackson P. Sayer, who picks up Dr. Loomis who was hitchhiking.I give this movie 2 thumbs up and 4 for gore,,lol",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers

211,very_doubtful,The best Halloween-sequel of them all! (!BEWARE: BIG SPOILER!),8,21 March 2000,"Michael Myers is back and this time he's after his niece. This is the best sequel (even better than Halloween H20) to one of the best films ever made. Although Carpenter wasn't involved with this one the film goes back to the roots of the Halloween series having much in common with the original. Again the film is full of suspense and has some very entertaining and original camera work.Michael Myers somehow survived the explosion in ""Halloween II"", as well as Dr. Loomis. However, Michael Myers fell into a coma but awakens when being transferred to another hospital and escapes again. He then goes after his niece who already has nightmares about her evil uncle.The film delivers plenty of good scares but is not too violent or gory. The ending is one of the best I have seen in a horror film. When Michael lies on the ground Jamie (his niece) touches him and some of the evil seems to get into Jamie. Michael is then shot by about a hundred cops and is thought to be dead although he disappears in a shaft. Back at home, in a point-of-view shot, we see Jamie grab a Halloween mask and what follows is almost identical to what happens at the beginning of the original Halloween. Truly brilliant!After Halloween III (which should not be given the acceptance as a part of the series) this movie was an immense improvement!My rating: 8/10 (but from here on the series gets worse)",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
212,kayrannells,Danielle Harris is Fantastic!,7,17 October 2020,"After serial killer Michael Myers wakes up during a routine transfer to a different hospital, he goes running back to Haddonfield and his former doctor, Dr. Loomis, tries to make it there before Michael can begin yet another bloodbath and murder his niece, Jamie.Having a young child as the lead victim in a slasher movie is a brave choice. Some will find it tacky and offensive right from the start or, even worse, the child actor might not be seasoned enough to be effective in the role and could just come across as annoying, but young Danielle Harris is so wonderful and winning in the role that you really get invested in her character and want her to make it out alive. Most of the other characters aren't developed enough for you to give a hoot about them, but the filmmakers do handle the suspense sequences well.",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
213,Horror_Metal,A spectacular sequel with great performances!,10,4 October 2013,"Ten years ago, Dr. Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasence) finally stopped the insatiable murderer Michael Myers (George P. Wilbur) by causing a huge explosion which engulfed them both in flames. They survived, however, with Michael in a coma and Dr. Loomis having some bad burn scars and having to walk with a cane. It is revealed that Michael's sister Laurie Strode, who he was trying to kill, died in a car accident a few years after he was burned to a crisp. Her nine year old daughter Jamie Lloyd (Danielle Harris), who is Michael's niece, has been living in a foster home where she is very close to her adoptive sister Rachel Carruthers (Ellie Cornell). Michael awakens from his coma, still covered in bandages, and escapes while being transported to another hospital. He kills several people and quickly finds a pasty white mask similar to the one he wore during his previous killing spree from a decade ago, along with his familiar gray coveralls. It becomes apparent that he is after his young niece and will stop at nothing to finish her off. Dr. Loomis must now stop his evil enemy once again before poor Jamie is killed! I can't decide whether I prefer this film or part 2 as the best Halloween sequel. Neither can compare to the original, but both are good in their own right. I like how Michael is now targeting a little girl as it gives the film a darker and meaner edge. This film also represents the actual Halloween spirit better than any other film in the series (with the possible exception of part 6). When I first watched this, I was thrilled to see Donald Pleasence as Dr. Loomis return as he is one of my favorite horror protagonists of all time. It may not be very realistic that he and Michael survived their fiery fate at the end of the second film, but that's okay because a suspension of disbelief is pretty much required to enjoy films like these anyway. Danielle Harris and Ellie Cornell are both great in their respective roles. Props mainly go to Harris for being able to pull off such a believable and emotional performance at such a young age. George P. Wilbur is an excellent Michael Myers, giving a very scary and intimidating portrayal which kind of reminded me of The Terminator. Anyway, those are some of the reasons why fans of the first two movies will love this entry, which shares no continuity with the unrelated but still good part 3. I would rate this magnificent sequel with a whopping 9 out of 10!",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
214,jwtrox08706,The best Halloween sequel until H20,10,28 July 2006,"Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers is arguably the best sequel to Halloween until Halloween H20. The script was written by a fan of the series itself, the characters are very genuine and they do the smart thing. Instead of running up to the figure she sees while frantically searching for Jamie on the streets, Rachel very wisely runs away from the menacing silhouette of what apparently is Michael Myers. There are many nods to the original: the clown costume that Jamie wears, Jamie herself, Dr. Loomis, the music, some lines the script...the list goes on. The characters are very genuine; they aren't supermodels like in so many other horror films. Until Halloween H20 came out this film was definitely the best Halloween sequel: bottom line.",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers

It's never forced and it's never over the top, like it is in the 5th. Michael's mask looks dumb and the retcon used to bring back Loomis and Michael from their deaths at the end of Halloween II was also very upsetting but it was made up with decent kills and a cute dog. Many of the characters are jerks and they all suck but the police are good and there are some good lines.

After the non Michael myers Halloween 3 sequel it was good to see them bring Michael back for this one. It turns out Michael wasn't killed from the explosion and fire in Halloween 2 and rather than going after laurie again Michael is this time trying to murder his young niece.Seems the original theme got a bit of a remix to it this time and I like it. Bodies pile up rather quickly even though some of the kills are off screen. Another doggo is seen dead in this one god damn Michael killing animals. This is possibly the best in the series if not definitely one of the top 3,Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers

220,RebelXStar,Ten years ago he tried to kill Laurie Strode. Now he wants her daughter.,6,31 January 2016,"Ten years after the events of the first two movies, Michael Myers is in hospital lying in a coma and Laurie Strode has been killed off screen in a car accident leaving behind her daughter, and Michael's niece, Jamie Lloyd.The night before Halloween, as he is being transferred between hospitals, Michael (who is noticeably bulky for someone who has spent a decade in a coma, but the less said about his appearance in this movie, the better) overhears the doctors talking about Jamie and this snaps him out his coma. He brutally attacks the ambulance staff and makes his way to Haddonfield to find his niece.From here, the story is essentially a re-tread of the first movie as Jamie is babysat by reluctant foster sister, Rachel where an innocent night of trick or treating gradually descends into chaos as Michael continues to circle both girls and their friends, eventually closing in on them.Donald Pleasance reprises his role as Dr. Loomis and does a great job as always.The film fails to capture the chilling atmosphere of the first movie, however one thing it does have in it's favour is the notably more Autumnal surroundings (Halloween was shot in California and there were times where it showed), shown beautifully in the movies opening credit sequence. I like the fact that Michael's main target is a little girl as it gives the movie a darker, more unique twist.Danielle Harris is excellent as Jamie and handles the subject matter of the movie well, without acting unrealistically mature or being annoying, as child characters have a tendency to do in horror movies. She is definitely one of the best child actors I have seen.",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers

Tonight, HE'S BACK!",10,8 April 2001,"Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers is a very well made horror film and is a great thrill-ride. It is incredibly suspenseful and entertaining. Donald Pleasence is a great actor and is very likable and I am so glad that he graced the Halloween series with his solid acting. I love you and miss you Mr. Pleasence. Ellie Cornell and young Danielle Harris also do excelent jobs at portraying their characters. If it weren't for Halloween 4, then I think that Halloween series would not be as successful as it is today. Thank God that Moustapha Akkad decided to continue with the Michael Myers story after ""Season of the Witch"". I love Halloween 3, but the Michael Myers films are much more fun. The Halloween series is so much better than the other horror series of the 80's. Also, I find that the Halloween flicks are no where near as cliced as a Friday the 13th films. This is my second favorite Halloween film. Right behind the first. Michael Myers is very scary also. I really love this film alot. It shows that a genuinely good horror sequel can come out of the 80's. A big improvement over Halloween 2 and 3, 'The Return of Michael Myers' delivers!A definite and well deserved 10 out of 10.",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers

223,CoolHand-4,To the Point!,6,31 March 1999,"Halloween 4 is without a doubt, one of the better sequels made to a horror movie (see Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm St).  The movie is technically well made and Danielle Harris gives a suprisingly good performance at a young age.  Not much gore content as far as horror movies go, and the movie relies more on suspense.  A very good movie by itself, but even better considering its a sequel.  A rating of 6 of 10 was given.",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
224,ryannemetz,Another successful installment,10,14 April 2004,"The film takes place 10 years after the end of the second film. (Note: Halloween 3) has no affiliation with Michael Myers. During the first and second film Myers' focus is circulated around stalking his sister, Laurie Strode.It's now been 10 years since Myers has been locked up in Richmond Mental Institute and once he escapes, his focus now is on on Laurie Strodes' niece, who is identified as Jamie. Jamie, is played by young actress Danielle Harris. Harris does an outstanding job portraying the young niece. Harris has a huge contribution in keeping the films momentum. This little thing can act!!Donald Pleasence reprises his role, as Dr. Loomis. As you'd assume, Pleasence gives another strong performance as the obsessed doctor on the hunt for his twisted patient.Once again, the films setting is based in Haddonfield, IL. If you happen to be a fan of the earlier series, then you should check this out. The sequel films that proceed after this tend to fall short of expectations and may grow tiresome.My personal favorite of the series would be the original, (considered by many as the best slasher flick of all time). However, this along with the second installment, are all worthy sequels.10 out of 10 for the last great sequel of the franchise.",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
225,cny_cd,A pretty good return to form......,7,27 January 2010,"I have to admit, that when I first went to see this movie I had very low expectations. Usually sequels get worse with each one, and since more than 10 years had passed since the original film, I figured that this movie would be pretty bad, especially since Jamie Lee Curtis wasn't in it. Overall this is a pretty good movie that brings Michael Myers back and introduces some new characters that are for the most part decent. I don't want to ruin the ending if you haven't seen this, but it implies that this series would take another interesting turn, but the very bland and uninteresting ""Halloween 5"" ruins this possibility. I would recommend this if you like the ""Halloween"" series, but make this the last one you watch. Everything after this gets pretty unwatchable......",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
226,mojo-15,A surprisingly good sequel,6,31 August 2000,"If they cut out 2,3,5,and 6, this would be one of the best sequels.  It would have Michael returning every decade with an original plot for every film.  This could be a great film by itself, not to mention with a title to really publicize it.  Here, Myers returns to Haddenfield to kill Laurie's daughter, who is left with her relatives.  Suspenseful, witty, but Michael won't die!  This takes away the realism.  Also, by this time, the film is too routine to be called excellent.  Maybe if it was the only serial killer horror film would I give it *** or above.  Until then, **1/2 out of ****.",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers

I was so shocked at the ending, it was fantastic, well done to the writers, what a twist. The story for Halloween 4 was very good, it has to be one of the best Halloween films and thats including the horrific remake, what a pile of crap that film was. I thought the little girl who played Jamie was very good. If you're looking for a film with scary moments and ones that will make you jump then this is the film for you, you will not be disappointed.

229,omp9,My favorite Halloween sequel,7,15 May 2015,"After the disappointment of not seeing Michael Myers in Halloween 3, Michael is now back from the dead and what a comeback! The movie starts perfect, the chilling and atmospheric intro is amazing, it captures the Halloween feeling perfectly, it's probably one of the most impressive intros I've ever seen. You can tell that the filmmakers had a very good team behind this film, cinematography is great and in the same vain as the original, setting is great, good directing and great casting, at least for the main characters. Donald Pleasence is as usual good as Dr. Sam Loomis, but it's those two girls who steals the show, Ellie Cornell and Danielle Harris, they have really good chemistry and acts very good. All that being said, H4: The Return of Michael Myers isn't perfect, sub-story with Rachel's boyfriend feel unnecessary, and there are other parts that just feels stupid.Overall, The Return of Michael Myers is pretty much in the same vein as the first one, so it's a big chance for you liking this part if you loved the original, even if it isn't the masterpiece Halloween was, it's still very enjoyable and it is among Halloween 2 and H20 best best sequels in the Halloween franchise.",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers

231,darthMisaskernew,The most underrated Halloween sequel by far!,8,12 November 2018,"Michael Myers is back! I liked the third one enough but many people were underwhelmed that there was no Michael Myers in it. Those people's wishes have been granted with Halloween 4, and it's a good movie to! It's mostly a loose remake of the first film but it's still really well made and scary! I love the opening credit sequence with bright orange font over creepy foggy atmospheric shots of fall scenery. It may not be the classic Halloween theme by legend John Carpenter, but it builds atmosphere in a new way. See? That's what I want from this film. The kills are all great and original, and I'd some of them even surpass the original! I'm in love with the overall design and cinematography of the film, but nobody will admit it. It does have lamer moments, but overall, Halloween 4 is a very well made sequel. Sure it's a bit too similar to the 1978 film, but it does enough differently.",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
232,claptonisgod53,Underrated,8,26 September 2008,"Halloween 4 is the most underrated sequel in the Halloween series. It is without a doubt the next sequel along with Halloween 4. What I loved about Halloween 4 is how it paid enough tribute to the original while still making the film new and different.Halloween 4 goes back to Haddonfeild continuing the storyline from Halloween 2. Halloween 4 introduces us to Jamie Loyd, who is the daughter of Laurie Strode. Laurie Strode died in a car accident, and now Jamie Loyd is living with a foster family. She begins to be haunted by the presence of her uncle. Is it all her imagination, or is Michael really back? Well, Michael is back. He awoke from a coma that he was but in back in 1978. Dr. Loomis also survived the terrible Hospital fire (go figure). Donald Pleasense is back in his role as Dr. Loomis, and lives up to his past reputation in the role he will always be remembered for.The cast is unbelievably good. The characters are ones we can somewhat relate to and enjoy seeing battle Myers. This is very rare for the slasher genre, which makes this movie VERY solid.The directing is also unbelievably amazing. I wasn't expecting the director to do such a good job recreating that atmosphere and suspense that the original introduced and delivered. The tension and build up of the Michael Myers character is back, which I felt like was lost in Halloween 2.Halloween 4 also has a list of plenty of fairly graphic, well done kills.Halloween 4 is a definite plus to the Halloween series. While Halloween 2 and 3 may have been good, Halloween 4 would be the last above average film in the series. As far as I'm concerned, the Halloween series ends on Part 4. Oh, and speaking of endings, Halloween 4 has one that you will never forget.Highly recommended",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
233,Cristopher_Jeorge,should of completed a trilogy,8,26 May 2004,"We can all agree that the original Halloween was a minor horror masterpiece. Halloween 2 suffered from a poor story but all things considered was a decent enough follow up. Halloween 3, well it was Michaeless so we wont go into it. I feel if under another title Halloween 3 would have stood up nicely on its on as a quite different little film. We do have Halloween 4, replace 3 with 4 and disregard parts 5 through the worst of them all 8 and the Halloween franchise becomes a tidy and taught trilogy. 4 has what it needs, Donald Pleasance first and foremost, this guy was the Halloween films. It also great continuity from part 2, Michaels been comatose after the after the explosion and Laurie Strode has died and left behind a niece to continue the Myers bloodline and provide a target for the soon revived and on the loose Shape. Halloween 4 does the job well and is for my money a better film then part 2. The story itself comes full circle with Michaels demise and his neice, in the same clown costume, murdering her mother to Dr. Loomis's shock and dismay. This ending should have been thee ending and the Halloween movies would be held in higher regard than then they are. Needless sequals have pretty much tarnished the Halloween mystique.  Sad since the original was pretty much a perfect movie. Halloween could also be a trilogy made up of parts 1,2 and 7 H20. H20 sees the return of  Jamie Lee as Laurie which is nice but with Pleasance gone and only present in the voice of a poorly done voice over, it just lacks the punch of 4. H20 in its own right is still a much better sequel then parts 5,6 or 8 and its up to you how youd like to view the Halloween trilogy. 1,2 and 7? or 1,2 and 4? Either way it makes for much better viewing than the rest of the horrid installments.",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers

This is the last good film featuring Michael. The cast was pretty good to, Dannelle Harris as Jamie, Ellie Cornell as Rachel and as always Donald Plesence gives a spectacular performance as Dr. Loomis.

He escapes and goes after the orphaned daughter of Laurie Strode while Dr. Loomis (also suffering from some burns) is hot on his tail.Halloween 4 is probably one of the better Halloween sequels due to a nice layer of atmosphere (those opening credits are pretty terrific) and a focus on character and suspense. It's not gory like other 80's slashers, which might not excite the gore fans, but it's a nice gateway slasher for people on the fence about slasher movies.Danielle Harris and Ellie Cornell make a great, likable team as Michael's niece and her adoptive sister. Donald Pleasance gets a chance to ham it up as Dr. Loomis again and he's always a treat to see on screen.If the film has any main issues, it's Michael's odd looking mask and the less wide aspect ratio.

This film has a recipe of suspense and thrills. Danielle Harris' acting in H4 is excellent and will please fans all over the world. Danielle really captures the essence of her character Jamie Lloyd ,and the believable dialogue that Jamie comes out with is very pleasing too. Donald Pleasence still captures the feel of Dr. Loomis. In this movie George P. Wilbur plays Michael Myers. George P. Wilbur plays Michael really well and seems to put a lot of effort as Michael.

It's just a shame about the mask (it looks very, very bad) which is too bland for a Myers' mask.The acting and story are very good, and the showdown in the Sheriff's house is very suspenseful, although the film does suffer from the sequel set-up at the end, it may be unexpected, but that doesn't make it any more welcome.",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers

239,Django-21,Best Halloween sequel!,7,2 November 2002,"After an unrelated third entry, this was a great return to form for the franchise.  As we'd already seen Michael Myers ""die"" several times already in the first two intstallments and get right back up again for more, it was no surprise that he could survive being set alight in Halloween II.  That Dr Loomis could survive his expected demise was more of a surprise, but he was a much loved character for the series and I'm glad he was in this sequel.  Donald Pleasance gives a wonderful performance and Dr Loomis is as reliable as ever (can see why people would think he's a bit loony though, what with all his ramblings).  The scene with the reverend in the antiquated automobile talking about apocalypse is amusing without ruining the tone of the movie. The vigilante squad roaming in absence of the police is a neat touch to the movie.  The whole locking the main characters in a house, unwittingly with Michael Myers is a contrived situation of course, but so's the premise of the whole series.  And it still manages some nice tension. My only main quibble here is that the reprise of John Carpenter's original theme has been needlessly tinkered with, robbing it of some of it's power. Pretty Ellie Cornell does a great job in this movie and acquits herself well in the role of Jamie's protector and a heroine in peril. She's the most likable teen of the series and her wholesomeness seems a lot more natural than the forced chastity and sainthood of Jamie Leigh Curtis's original character. Danielle Harris does a great job in the role of the young girl, Jamie.  When has a child actor ever been this un-annoying before?  She does a good job of evoking sympathy and being believable and she and Ellie Cornell do a great double act (you could almost believe they really are sisters). We all know what's going to happen in the film, Michael Myers is going to kill a few people and noone's going to be able to stop him completely but the film is well crafted of it's kind, fun to watch, well acted and does create some tension and gets us to care for the characters.  It's certainly a few notches above the average slasher sequel.  The last scene, refreshingly actually comes as a real shock and Donald Pleasance's performance really sells it that this is Dr Loomis driven to the point of dementia and beyond, by the revelation that it's all about to start all over again.  A great entertaining continuation of the Halloween series and definetly for me the best of the sequels.",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
240,dkemathas,In aftermath...,8,24 May 2013,"''Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers'' is actually the best sequel in the Halloween franchise. Both Halloween (1978) and Halloween 2 (1981) are predictable, but somehow this installment is more nerve-wracking and more exciting than the previous films.It is the first film in the franchise (apart from ''The Season of the Witch'') that doesn't feature the character Laurie Strode (portrayed by Jamie Lee Curtis), but it introduces Jamie Lloyd (Danielle Harris), the daughter of Strode and Jimmy Lloyd. Donald Pleasence has returned for the third time as Dr. Samuel Loomis and George P. Wilbur has been chosen to be the third actor to play the shape, Michael Myers. Ellie Cornell, Sasha Jenson, Michael Pataki and Beau Starr play other pivotal roles.The film doesn't show anything new. It has the same story line as the first and the second one, but what that makes this installment special from the previous films is that Michael Myers is more cruel and more dangerous than he has ever been. A cold-hearted psychopath has returned back to Haddonfield on the hunt for his niece, the last generation of the Myers's family. As a personal feeling, the Halloween films are not scary at all, but they are exciting and keep your nerves and mind busy. If you're looking for a Saturday night horror, watch Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers.

Rather weird movie. where to start..Well, Myers is back, he escapes at the start and is in search of Jamie, his neice. Why? To kill her, silly! So, why does he wanna kill her? A mystery. They could have re-thought the plot some before releasing this. Acting is quite good. Somethings weird about this, Myers never says a word throughout the movie, Dr Loomis always appears depressed, or sick. The acting isn't up to scratch. Now, the special effects are simply s**t. The gun-shots sound like those of those aincent westerns. There is NO BLOOD throughout the whole movie. Funny how charachters can be shot, stabbed and run-over without once bleeding. This was given a R rating in the US, which is weird, there are no gory deaths like the other halloweens, and theres no nudity, sex, or blood. It is a decent movie for the Halloween fan. A bit out of date though, and it lacks Halloween elements. At least Myers is back to his old tricks. Only..without blood..",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers

For me it is the Halloween franchise and I will watch of the movies no matter how bad they may be. This particular movie is not as bad as the next one, a little more entertaining than the 2nd movie, but no where near as good as the original.In this installment, Michael Myers some how survived the fiery blast in the hospital at the end of Halloween 2. He was in a coma at the maximum security hospital for 11 years and is getting transferred to a minimum security hospital, again, on the day before Halloween, again, and of course in middle of his transfer, he kills all of the ambulance drivers, brutally, and heads back to Haddonfield. Meanwhile, his sister Laurie Strode, was killed in a car accident, but still had time to have a daughter, Jamie, played by Danielle Harris (The Last Boy Scout) who had since been adopted by another family and now has a sister named Rachel, played by Ellie Cornell (House of the Dead,) who is upset that she has to baby sit her sister during Halloween while everyone is out partying. As Michael Myers heads towards town, Dr. Loomis, played once again by Donald Pleasance (You Only Live Twice,) is hot on his heels trying to warn everyone that Myers is on his way.The movie is very clichéd by this point, mostly because by the time this installment of Halloween had been released in 1988 and the last installment of 1981, there had been six Friday the 13th's, four Nightmare on Elm Streets, and one Child's Play. Because of this, there are not a whole of original scares. One of my dislikes in this movie is that, in the first Halloween, you could knock him down, but he would get right back up and come for some more, in the second one I don't think anything happened to him until the end, by this time he was not only getting shot, but hit with rifles in the face, and getting run over by a truck. He went from being a vulnerable but unstoppable psycho to Jason Vorhees, you could nuke him and he would still come after you. Ho-Hum.The movie also borrowed a lot from the original movie in the death scenes, lots of running objects through people. The final scene with Jamie turning on her step-mother and wearing the clown mask that Michael had when he killed his sister, was very predictable, and some what entertaining.I did like both actresses, the young and the old, in the movie. Ellie did a very Jamie Lee Curtis like job as being the vulnerable yet tough girl who is trying to keep Michael away from her sister. Danielle did a good job as the screaming without being annoying victim. For example of annoying see the young girl in the movie Aliens. Donald Pleasance was also entertaining again as the Doctor, however, he was starting to show his age by this point and should have called it a career by the end of this movie. Surprisingly he survived for two more bad Halloween sequels and about another 10 movies, but he still did them, but he was done.As always my biggest problem with the movie was the actor who was Michael Myers i.e. The Shape. He was not as menacing as the first movie and this time the mask was not as intimidating as the original mask. The difference between the two would be that in the first movie, the mask was of something else, and now, the mask is an actual Michael Myers mask trying to be the original mask. Not the same. Oh and lets not forget that at the end of the 2nd movie, Laurie had shot both of his eyes out, yet he can see, so in order for this movie to be at all enjoyable you have to forget that fact.Anyway, this movie is very OK. If you can't get the original than I would rent this instead of the 2nd movie because it is more enjoyable than that one. I will say that I probably like it better than I should but I have already told you why.**To see more reviews like this go to www.bbmc.dockratent.com**",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers

244,Jeffronthi-950-543134,The Beginning of Folly,7,17 January 2019,"6.5/10I love this film. Incredible opening sequence, tightly paced, no frills, decent kills, quaint fall, mid-western mood, solid George P Wilbur performance, despite the bad mask. The mask was understandable from a continuity standpoint, as most cheap masks are about as good. But they definitely could have supplied an incidentally creepier one.I take issue with a few things, aside from the mask, like how in the hell MM got on that truck. Not a big deal, I know, but they could have supplied a scene showing this while they were rallying at the school. There was only a moment. We can forgive a lot, but a film should always try. Also, what is up with the blonde MM mask in the school? ""Ah, they can deal with it, it's just a Halloween sequel..."" must have been the thought, unfortunately.People take issue with the ending, and I do not get it. To me, the transference of Evil to Jamie is an intriguing and creepy ending. Oh, the possibilities that could have come. Every one loves a mystery, but it kinda made sense that the evil was a sort of active force. So the ending was rather plausible to me.From go, mechanically, this movie is one of the better movies in the series, regardless of faults.",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers

The mask of Michael Myers is terrible in this entry and adding insult to injury on the posters the original mask is shown!

247,sjmdd,Big Dumb and pointless,4,15 April 2009,"The 'first' of the Halloween sequels, released in 1988, is where the whole franchise, in my opinion, began to go downhill, its where it all began in terms of the myers/slasher phenomenon. 10 years since the 78 classic they decided to bring back myers, and there begins the problem; this movie is made blatantly by and for people who had no concept of what made the original so outstanding. Don't get me wrong, it is entertaining if you can overlook the films many Deficiences and does have some suspenseful moments.The Bad: For example; how does myers(who was blown up and incinerated at the end of 2) plus being in a coma for ten years manage to easily kill the ambulance attendants and flee? after ten years on a trolley myers'd be in need of a touch of physiotherapy! Then a horribly burned man manages to get to haddonfield and get into a store and steal a mask without been seen! i mean come on! Added to the scenes where myers manages to get into the back of a police car and then when they get to the house you see the back door is open; but we all know police back doors cant be opened from the inside for obvious reasons.just silly. And when myers appears on the truck, presumably he was hiding underneath? some feat to come popping out when the trucks doin 60! There are many more aspects of this movie that i thought were dumb, the overall feel of the movie went against the original so much. so wonder carpenter bailed out. as i say, if you want a fun gory movie, this is probably for you, it certainly isn't boring but is in no way comparable to the original.",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
248,PhillipMichaelH,A good quality sequel.,8,28 May 2011,"Halloween 3 was intended as an experiment to include different stories and concepts. The response was negative to say the least and John Carpenter had no involvement with the rest of the series, not even as producer. Moustapha Akkad (financer of the first three films) bought the rights to the series and after seven years, Michael Myers returned to screens.This movie was intended to as Akkad stated ""Go back to the basics"". I personally feel that the series didn't go back to the basics until Halloween: H20 ten years later after this movie. This movie was still a fun ride and has the most haunting opening title sequence in the entire series. The characters are well developed and performed by a strong cast. This movie was highly praised by fans of the series, more so then the other sequels. Donald Pleasence returned to play Dr. Loomis and he's still the heart of the series. I really like the character of Jamie, played by Danielle Harris who does a fine job. Director Dwight Little lifted the infamous shot in Vertigo by Alfred Hitchcock. You will see this in the gas station scene. Just like the other sequels, this is a pretty good entry in the series and good quality horror.",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers

250,LuckyMatt93,A lot more misses than hits,6,12 April 2009,"Halloween 4 is sadly one of the worst in the series, although it's miles better than the atrocious Halloween 6 and the unwatchable Resurrection. That's not saying much, but oh well.It's just more of the same crap over again, with hardly any originality. It mainly consists of annoying shallow characters, a barrel of overused clichés, and hysterical dialog. Michael Myers has now become a recycled and tiresome plot device. He isn't captured in a scary light like he was in the first two films, and to make matters worse, the design of his mask is absolutely atrocious.The director failed to provide the dark, grim, and eerie feel that Carpenter and Rosenthal did. It's just bland. Ugh.Donald Pleasance is really the saving grace of Halloween 4. Wonderful as always (although here he does look tired and bored of his character; I can see why). There's also Danielle Harris, who is a surprisingly strong child actress. The introduction of kiddies into horror films can often ruin them yet Harris holds her own against her fellow cast members. Unfortunately, those two are about the only good actors in the film and all around one of the few redeeming factors of this otherwise incredibly weak sequel. It has it's moments where I think it shows it could be something really good, but it's then bogged down by chunks of the movie that are just plain dismal. Especially when the gang of rednecks form a lynch mob and go out to get them some Michael on a stick.The execution and pacing is very poor. The screenplay and direction is aimless, uneven and shoddy. By the third act, the film's a boring and repetitve mess, devoid of any scares, any build up, any eerie moments, or any real suspense.A number of things in the film are just too incidental, ie; there are too many excuses and lame motivations for said events to happen. At the beginning, we are shown how the phone lines will come to not work in a disappointing and incidental fashion; we are shown much later on shots of Rachel and her baby sister running into the house's attic followed by a close up of Myers taking a random knife off a shelf that just happened to be there: did Rachel not think to grab a weapon? Did she not run past the exact same shelf? Or did the character of Myers jump a temporal filmic space downstairs into the kitchen in the space of one cut? Twinned with this, the resulting fight on the roof plays out in a very humorous way with Myers lumbering around with his knife and characters surviving thirty foot falls.Lastly, it doesn't know what to do with itself. At one point it seems like it's going to become a survival thriller in the vein of a Romero zombie flick. Then it seems like it'll be more of an action film what with the loading up of the posse. Later it seems like it's leading into militarism as the characters rush to an outpost to defend themselves from this supernatural attacker. However, none of these threads are fully realized and the characters seem unable to just sit down and bide their time. They get up and wander around for no reason, they run in ridiculous and unproductive directions, and none of them seem able of getting an ounce of communication out.To wrap things up, Halloween 4 is a disappoint on nearly every level. This film marks the point when the series officially turned stale.",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers

I blame it very much, but I can also attest to the fact that no one really watches this film, except die-hard fans. I was a die hard fan myself once, but not so much anymore. The concept of the latter day family linked to Michael Meyers is interesting, and certainly a subject to be delved into, if the script be good enough. Saddly, it just revived the first one, and...well, what do you think came next? You know what? This one is more interesting to watch, for me. The first one is so overrated, and praised by such Nimrods and Rob Zombie, that it's not even worth a mention, except that it started the series. Alas, I digress. I have no real compassion for this series anymore, but I will keep tabs on it for many years to come, because at one point or another, it was part of my life too.",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers

255,whineycracker2000,The most faithful in terms of its priorities,8,23 August 2021,"Many seem to forget that the original Halloween had no real story to begin with, nor was it meant to-as Carpenter himself has reiterated over and over. The characters were natural and engaging, but they were not the selling point. So if you are somebody who believes a great Halloween film has to showcase a lot of Jamie Lee Curtis kicking butt, Halloween 4 is probably going to be a snooze fest for you, because she is not the focus here. Director Dwight H. Little understands that it was the simplicity that made the original so effective. He also understands that anticipation can be a lot scarier than the bloody carnage on display when it finally arrives, and he takes a cue from Carpenter in the way he prioritizes atmosphere and suspense over excess. And for a film that turns 33 years this year, it still holds up.This third sequel to Carpenter's game-changer was fashioned more as a tribute to the original rather than a mere straight-up continuation. Little took the project as seriously as one possibly could, treating Carpenter's property with the utmost respect and never underestimating the audience's standards and expectations. It's not Carpenter, nor does it try to be. Little and company commendably invoke the mood and the spirit, but not necessarily the style, of the original. They achieve this through some fine, and often overlooked, details. For instance, note the scene where Sheriff Meeker and Deputy Logan are chatting about securing the windows as Meeker lights the lamp. If you blink, you will miss the outline of the Shape standing in the background behind a wall (similar to the more obvious moment when The Shape's white mask protrudes out of the darkness behind Ellie Cornell). These sporadic, deceptively simple ""now you see it, now you don't"" visual motifs are genuinely creepy because they are so fleeting that they don't call attention to themselves.Unlike some of the later sequels, Halloween 4 avoids ""idiot plot"" syndrome-a term Roger Ebert coined, in which the stupidity of the characters' actions makes it easier to kill them off and/or prevents the story from being resolved too soon. The characters here make smart and sensible decisions, for the most part. You will not find two horny middle-aged adults 'skinny-dipping' in a Jacuzzi in a desolate hospital after hearing reports of a murder spree taking place in the nearby vicinity. Instead, they barricade themselves inside an unassuming location containing a presumable arsenal of firearms and two very no-nonsense deputies- with the National Guard en route.""Return"" probably marks the official moment in the series where it makes it very clear that we are no longer dealing with the flesh and blood psychopath from the original, but something more omnipresent, spectral-like, and formidable (""You're talking about him as if he were a human being. That part of him died years ago"" Loomis laments). By presenting us with this new version of the Boogeyman it helps to lessen viewers' incredulity when his ability to seemingly be in several places at once starts to become apparent.The film ends with a final image that could serve as a prognostication of what the horror genre, for better or worse, would become in just a few short years to follow- reinforcing the underlying theme of Carpenter's original: that evil, of course, never dies. And the destruction of innocence is indeed one of the most tragic forms of evil.Again, Halloween 4 is not Carpenter, but it stands on its own while paying homage. Thankfully, for a film that was obviously motivated by dollar signs (as every sequel is), Moustapha Akkad didn't take the easy way out and pile on a lot of sex and gore to ensure higher box office returns. And I can't think of any other film that stretches a meager 3-million dollar budget as far as this film does (IMDB states its budget is 5 million but I was corrected by the director himself).On a final note: This film was made to be seen on the big screen. If you get a chance, catch it on its 35mm presentation, it's far better in almost every respect than its digital format).",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers

267,Verdugo85,The boogeyman is back!,8,22 May 2018,"This sequel is directed by Dwight H. Little who directed couple of kick ass action movies like ""Marked For Death"" with Steven Seagal, ""Rapid Fire"" with Brandon Lee and a good crime thriller ""Murder at 1600"" with Wesley Snipes. Halloween 4 is suppose to be the rebirth of the series that reintroduces Michael Myers when the character was withdrawed after Halloween II. Because of Myers absence in Halloween III, the movie outraged fans and resulted to be a box office disappointment so Myers was brought back six years later.Halloween 4 begins on October 30th 1988, Michael has been in a comatose state ever since the explosion at the Haddonfield Memorial hospital along with Dr. Loomis 10 years prior from his original killing spree on Halloween night 1978. Burned and in bandages, Michael is being transferred to Smith Grove sanitarium. While on route, Michael overhears one of the Smith Grove staffs saying that his sister Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) is dead and her daughter Jamie Lloyd (Danielle Harris) lives in Haddonfield with her foster family. Michael awakens, kills off the staffs and then escapes to Haddonfield to go after his niece. Dr. Loomis is also back after he survived the big explosion, wtf? and drives out to Haddonfield after he learns that Michael escaped. Jamie Lloyd is an innocent little girl who's been going through a difficult time. She misses her mother, mourns her and she feels like an outsider because she doesnt feel like she's being loved by her foster family. She's having nightmares of the boogeyman. She's aware that Michael Myers is her murderous uncle. She also gets bullied, mocked in school by her peers about her mother Laurie being dead and Michael Myers being her boogeyman uncle.. Her life goes into madness when she meets her evil uncle but her stepsister Rachel (Ellie Cornell) is there to protect her. I have a few problems with this film. First, Michael's mask is bad, I dont like it. His mask looks like the android ""Data"" from Star Trek. I know that the white Captain Kirk mask from the original was given to Dick Warlock who played Michael in Halloween II but they could've done a remodel of that mask since this sequel brings back the boogeyman. Second, the stuntman who plays Myers (George P. Wilbur) wore shoulder pads to look ""imposing"", why? He didnt need that. He looked ridiculous. Third, Nothing against Donald Pleasence but his character should've stood dead. Michael is the only supernatural being in the universe so it's excusable that he survived the explosion because he's pure evil. Oh and Michael's eyes healed. Both of his eyes were shot off by Laurie in Halloween II that blinded him but in H4, he's fine and he can see but again, he's pure evil. Overall, Halloween 4 is a good sequel with good plot, likeable characters, the fall season atmosphere, the action element where Michael has a fight scene with Jamie's older stepsister's boyfriend, Brady. Then near the end Michael knocks off a few armed rednecks that tried to stop him off their pickup truck.

Though he is supposed to be heavily medicated inside the ambulance once one of the doctor in whose care Michael Myers is in mutters to his assistant about a living relative a niece the daughter of Laurie Strode still living in Haddonfield well the psychopath's mission is reactivated. He attacks and kills the ambulance crew making his escape back to Haddonfield.Dr. Loomis is now a scarred and crippled shadow of his former self, he storms into the office of the director that runs the Ridgemont Federal Sanitarium. While giving the director a piece of his sound advice, the telephone rings with the bad news. The chase is on.Jamie Lloyd is the biological daughter of Laurie Strode lives with her two adoptive parents and her half sister Rachel. She has vivid nightmares of Michael Myers (""the Nightmare Man"") possibly psychically linked to her uncle.Sheriff Brackett has been retired since 1981 and living down in St Petersburg Florida, living the good life under the sun and on the beach. His replacement is Sheriff Ben Meeker whose daughter Kelly is a slut with a rack to flaunt it.The mission is to stop Michael Myers from killing the last link of his bloodline.What follows is a dull zero suspense exercise of Friday The 13th horror this includes a Terminator-like mass murder of the police station, dumb kids playing pranks on the edgy Sheriff Meeker with loaded revolver in hand *DUCK!*, and a redneck lynch mob blowing away the innocent citizenry of Haddonfield. What a boring dumb movie I just hate that I wasted nearly 90 minutes worth of my life on such cliché ridden dreck.A barrel of overused clichés. And a lot of Donald Pleasance's lines were too hysterical. Very bad. And the film has the nerve to steal a riff from Friday The 13th IV/V with the ending.",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
272,jjpurwitsky,The Halloween Saga: Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers,4,12 July 2012,"Halloween III was poorly received by critics and audiences alike and had no impact on the box office. Audiences were disappointed by the film, thinking they were ripped off because Season of the Witch was not a 'Halloween' movie. John Carpenter and Debra Hill left the series and went on to do other things and effectively the Halloween series was dead.Over the next few years the slasher film was officially cemented into the annals of cinema history. And so it was that in 1988, ten years after Halloween created this subgenre of film, Moustapha Akkad secured the rights to the franchise and decided to cash in on the genre that he helped create. On October 21st, 1988, Halloween 4 was released. The first Halloween was original, scary, and well made, the second was well made and fun and the third was original and different. Halloween 4 pales in comparison, not only to the three films that came before it but to many of the imitators that followed in the original Halloween's wake.Right from the beginning of this film things just seemed off. The credit sequence done so effectively in the first three is gone. Instead we get shots of barns, and painted skulls and windmills with the sun setting behind it. Sure it sets the mood of the halloween season, but it isn't very Halloween.Once the story kicks in, we find that Michael Myers and Dr, Loomis didn't die at the end of part II, they were just horribly burned, and Myers has been lying in a coma for ten years. Laurie is dead, and her daughter is living with family. And so Myers awakens to go after her while Loomis chases after him.The acting in Halloween 4 is by far the worst of all the four films. Ellie Cornell, the female lead, is rather stiff and stilted and Danielle Harris, who plays Laurie's daughter Jamie, is a great screamer and can show fear rather well, but when it comes to crying and other emotions she just falls apart.Donald Pleasance is the only returning actor and as usual his performance is rather good but as a viewer one can't help but feel sad for him every time he appears. He puts so much into his role and loves the character but everything else around him is so badly done that it becomes depressing watching him. Take Michael Myers for example. While a terrible force of evil in the first film and a gruesome killing machine in the second, here he is rather lame. Not only does he move differently (no awkward and eerie head movements) but he just doesn't seem that imposing. He is seen mostly in full frame shots with lots of light and thus he just isn't that scary. What made Myers so scary to begin with was his ability to become one with the shadows.And the deaths in this film are pretty lame. They take place off screen for the most part, which seems to be a deliberate attempt at recreating the feel of the original. But in the original, Myers only murdered three people and although there was not much blood and gore, all three deaths were seen on screen in glorious terrifying detail. Here you don't see the deaths, instead the film-makers either cut away from them or a character stumbles upon them long after they were killed.The direction by Little is terrible in this movie. The editing is poor and the cinematography is weak. Gone are the glorious widescreen shots of Dean Cundey, only to be replaced by unintentionally shaky and bland shots with generic lighting and poor framing. The editing is choppy and doesn't flow well and the film, although only 88 minutes and the shortest in the series, ends up feeling a lot longer than it's predecessors.And although Halloween III had a lot of plot holes, part 4 makes it seem like an Oscar winner. Sure Myers can do some incredible things; find people when he should have no idea where they are; drive a car with out learning how to; but in this movie Myers has become something more. Now Myers can appear in one part of town in one scene and in the next he can be in a completely different part of that town. He appears anywhere where the story needs him to be with no regard for logic. And when Loomis is looking for the schoolhouse, in Haddonfield of all places, he needs help, even though he has been there before.After 7 years of waiting for Michael Myers to return to the big screen, he finally does and boy oh boy does he disappoint. There are very few good things to say about this movie. The best thing about it is the Halloween theme by John Carpenter, and even that isn't heard enough. Donald Pleasance puts his all into the role but is let down by everything around him and the gore and nudity (now an almost requirement in the slasher films) is virtually non existent. Even when the opportunities arise to deliver the goods, they never happen. From the opening frame to just shy of the last minute, Halloween 4 disappoints. Then in the last minute, a twist arrives. It's rather interesting, it's cool, it's original and it opens up room for a rather original sequel. Other than that, Halloween 4 is a disaster, a mess and a complete waste of time.

273,tmcona-1,Deserves More Credit Than It Gets,7,24 February 2007,"The Halloween saga continues in this very good installment. The film is very short, but the scares and the fun continue on even after the movie is over. While Halloween 2 was a very gory film, Halloween 4 is a tad gory, but the scares are fresh and new. Some people say that the Myers mask used in this film is bad, I actually like it. Dwight Little does a great job of refreshing the plot. A new sheriff, and a new damsel in distress (played wonderful by Danielle Harris), and of course everyone's favorite Donald Pleasence as the trench coat adversary Doctor Loomis. Micheal Myers is played by rookie George P. Wilbur who returned in Halloween 6. The gore in the film is a side note, but comes in at great times. The shotgun through the stomach is awesome. The beginning credits are very creepy, and the gas station scene is awesome. Loomis gets thrown through a door, looks like they forgot to dye Micheal's hair. LOL. Actually the truth behind that mask is it is actually the real William Shatner masked. It was put in the film for just s few seconds I guess is some tribute to Shatner. LOL. IDK. Pretty stupid. Just makes the editing look bad, but oh well. Great Film. Watch it by yourself. I did. The ending is the best part of the movie, but Dominic Orthin whatever is name is ruins it in Halloween 5. The last minute is thrilling and makes you wonder. 7 out of 10.Rated R for Strong Blood/Gore Violence, Language, and Partial Nudity.",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
274,steveneven,Halloween 4: The Sequel That Did Not Disappoint,5,6 July 2014,"With a 5 out of 10 vote, you would think the review title would almost be a joke, but it is not. ""Halloween 4"" welcomes the return of Donald Pleasence, who lives up to his last name. Pleasence gives a performance that rivals the original's and ""Halloween II""'s. Moreover, Danielle Harris' acting debut is a fantastic one. For a little kid, she knows how to convey that childlike innocence of someone her own age without coming off ham-fisted or unnatural. And Michael Myers, dare I say, might be at his most intense here? Although, we should talk about ""The Return"" in pieces. First off, the acting is a lot better this time around than in ""Halloween II"" or ""III"". No obnoxious characters. No performance that shows on celluloid. Now, this is not ""The Godfather"" level of acting, but for a horror movie, especially for a 3rd horror sequel, it is pretty good. The script also helps. We do not have too many Gotcha! moments, there are no cut-aways to the gore, and the pacing is a little brisker this time around. Director Dwight H. Little knows how to get the ball rolling.So then what is the problem? Unfortunately, this movie lacks the charm of the original or the two sequels that followed. Now I did not watch this movie constantly comparing it to its predecessors, but watching ""Halloween 4"", you almost get a sense of ""this was done better before"". Now do not get me wrong, Michael is very intimidating here, the acting is a little better than usual, but it is missing that atmosphere. See, the film is set in Haddonfield which helps, and ""Halloween 4"" feels like Halloween (we have some trick-or-treaters, houses decorated, etc.), but at times, the film gets so dark that you cannot see anything. Also, There are times where it feels like there is just a dead body here and there for the sake of amplifying the scariness level. And, I thought all the insults toward Danielle Harris' character were a bit overbearing. I mean, some of those insults? Playground insults are not that intimidating. These are minor quibbles, but ""Halloween 4"" really is not anything substantial. Yet, you almost cannot do anything innovative considering ""Halloween"" is on its fourth movie, we know what is going to happen, and we need to leave the door open for more Michael mayhem. Because of this, ""Halloween 4"" is a little perplexing to review. You will no doubt enjoy it (I mean is that not the reason why we watch these movies?), and it will not completely kill your brain cells (I liked the second ""Halloween"", but at times my brain was shutting down), but there is just something missing. I do not really blame the director or scriptwriters for it. They did the best with what they could, but the score still stands. Yet, I am still sticking by my title ""Halloween 4: The Sequel That Did Not Disappoint"".",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
275,FAIZ555,It's fun and all but not groundbreaking to me,7,18 February 2018,"I prefer part 3 over this one because I found part 3 to be more enjoyable.

It's not the best but it's enjoyable.",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
276,hireswell,Better Than Average Sequel,6,9 August 2000,"Halloween 4 at least makes an attempt to create suspense and mood as opposed to just being another gore fest. The plot is pretty simple: Michael Myers escapes from yet another mental health facility to wreak havoc on quiet town of Haddonfield. This time the his target is his 8 year old niece, Jamie, played with style by Danielle Harris. The film was shot in darker tones which adds to the creepy mood and the gore is kept somewhat tame.There are some draw backs, however. The first is Donald Pleasence, who, of course, should be dead, considering what happened at the end of Halloween II. I loved his performances in the first two Halloweens, his speeches on Michael Myers gave the shape the wonderful characterization of ""..purely and simply evil."" In this film, though, he seemed tired and unattached to his pursuit. My other complaint is the ending. Where the first film ended with a true sense of dread that the evil was still loose, this one has an ending that is done simply for the purpose of another sequel.Still I liked it enough to recommend it to any fan of the series.",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers

This was my second favorite, I was gripping my couch at every scene. It stars the old original Donald Pleasance and although there is no talented Jamie Lee, there is Danielle Harris playing a girl named Jamie. It takes off 10 years after the events of Halloween 1978. The title can promise a good movie for a good Halloween franchise fan. Very little blood and gore (see the parental guide for more) and great A-B acting. The storyline is pretty dumb, but hey, it's still a good movie if you actually have an imagination. Good job Dwight H. Very Good Job.",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers

I like this movie because most of the murders aren't all blood and guts, being Subtle is this movies strength. This movie is simplistic like the original. The only problems I have are trivial but worth mentioning. For example the masks in 1 & 2 are scarier or maybe it doesn't fit the actor as well, you'll know it when you see it. The other problem is that Michael Myers pacing is faster. In the first 2 movies he walked very slow and still was able to catch up with who he was pursuing which was more chilling.",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
279,LanderRei,Second best in the series!,9,14 July 2002,"Often times its an unwritten rule that no sequel in a horror movie series can be better than the original. But that doesnt mean the sequels cant be great. This is one of the 4 good Halloween movies ( Halloween, H4, H5 and Resurrection)The storyline: Myers has awoken from his coma ( Not suprising, he was only shot once or twice and burnt to a crisp in the last movie) and now hes after his 7 year old neice, Jamie. ( Played wonderfully by the very talented Danielle Harris) Sure, the storyline is nothing special but this is a slasher, be thankful there is a story.Violence and gore are well done too. Too bad Myers doesnt know how to work a shotgun though.Director Dwight Little did a great job with this movie.( Heh, coincidence, my grandfathers name was Dwight Small) Donald Pleasence as always did great as Loomis, and same goes for Ellie Cornell.

Halloween 4 starts out showing Myers surviving the fiery explosion thought to have killed him in part 2 but rather being in a coma for the last decade. Now awake he goes after his young Nice Jaime Llyod the orphaned daughter of heroine Laurie Strode. Dr. Loomis, who also survived the explosion, now scarred and crippled races to stop him.Halloween 4 is the best of all 8 films in my opinion, cause the atmosphere and plot are the most original along with a superior script penned by Alan McElroy. Danielle Harris is amazing as Jaime and Ellie Cornell does a great job as Rachel. The real star of the film is Donald Pleascene, reprising his role as Loomis. he is an amazing hero and a great character, especially in the scene at the gas station where he confronts Myers he shows absolutely no fear whatsoever.

The story of Laurie Strode's daughter( and Michael Myers Niece) is epic. Michael is trying to find his niece, to attempt to murder her. Dr.Loomis has like the best acting role in the movie.

Loomis now walks with the aid of a stick and has burns to his face and hands but is otherwise fine. Blimey! He's almost as indestructible as Myers himself! Halloween 4 racks up the jumps and gore but loses none of the thrills and excitement form the original movies.

I always wonder why the directors didn't cast any bright cast members of that day.  Danielle Harris? Well, SOME people know her if you like horror movies.  Ellie Cornell? Beau Starr?  Couldn't they at least asked Corey Haim or Ally Sheedy to play the parts?  They were the 'teen sensations' back in the eighties.

286,smoothgroove16,Possibly the most enjoyable Michael Myers Film??,9,16 January 2002,"First things first, I don't need to tell you the relief I felt when I found out the 4th Halloween installment saw a return of Michael. So pretending the 3rd Halloween never took place this follows 10 years from the original.The start is brilliant, dark and very atmospheric because of the hospital, the weather and the creepy security guard behind the desk, who fills us in on the ending of the 2nd. The escape which although is a little expecting still scared me very bad! Its not long before we are introduced to Jamie, the likeable daughter of Laurie, who is brilliantly acted. The acting in this film is excellent the whole way through with other likeable characters in Rachel and the police chief. Dr. Loomis makes his return as a frail old man who although well played you cant help but feel his character is a little past it. Yet he comes back after Michael and their meeting in the petrol garage is frantic! So set up is the rest of the movie, a cat and mouse hunt for Jamie by 'the almost impossible to stop' Michael with Loomis hunting the killer.The best bit in the movie is in the police cheif's house. It seems a very realistic setting and the 'no way out' part is brilliant. I won't reveal anymore in-case you've never seen it but this movie is by far one of my favourite's in the series. I could have hoped for no more in the return of micheal myers and the stronger, more powerful Michael Myers was a brilliant way to stop the character getting boring. So with an excellent story and great acting I'd give this movie 9.5/10!",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
287,TheDustFactor,Greatest Halloween must have been in 1988,10,5 July 2003,"This is definitely my favorite Halloween movie, and horror/slasher movie ever.  The reason this movie was great is because, there was a high amount of suspense through the movie, and they managed to pull this off in a sequel.  One thing that I truley loved about this movie, is they made some new killing scenes, and didn't go out of control with it like the Friday the Thirteenth series.  It was unique, but stuck to the original, if that makes any sense.  Honestly I find it to be just as enjoyable, good , exciting, and scary as the original as the first one, but what gives it that extra edge is Danielle Harris.  So in all I would say this is my favorite horror of all time, even better than the original.  If you like the Halloween series rent this movie for sure.

I know I complained that making Laurie Strode his sister took away from his mystery, but since this is a sequel to that film, they worked with what they had, and it actually works now. Michael doesn't have the same mask as before. He has some cheapy piece of garbage rip off that makes him look less scary. The first mask was iconic, and they couldn't get it back. Michael goes around massacring countless people in hilarious ways, like impaling a woman with a shotgun, ripping a guy's throat open with his bare hands, and electrocuting a man. The movie isn't half bad. Michael is a lot less scary, but Dr. Loomis' return is welcome, and the characters are genuinely likable.

Halloween 4 takes place 10 years after the events of the first 2. We find out Laurie had a daughter called Jamie Lloyd, played by Danielle Harris. She has visions and bad dreams of Michael every now and again, even though she doesn't know who he is. Jamie is living with a foster family with her sister Rachel, played by Ellie Cornell. Rachel knows of the events that happened a decade before, as does Jamie. We then find out Michael had escaped from an ambulance and then goes on a killing spree heading for Haddonfield after killing a mechanic and stealing a big red truck. Dr. Loomis is of course back and is once again chasing after Michael. Once Michael finally gets to Haddonfield, he cuts the towns power, which I find was a very smart move for the film. And so Michael goes on his usual killing spree to get to Jamie. Of course, the suspense, character setting and well written plot is still there. Halloween 4 is filled with fun, and is an all out roller coaster ride, right up to the end. All in all, Halloween 4 was a brilliant comeback for Michael.

The slow-moving, menacing, precise, terrifying and discomforting massive character that could walk without making any noise, and show up anywhere, at any time. Well, he can still walk without making a noise, and show up anywhere and at any time, but other than that, he's a very different character. Surprise! Myers didn't die after getting blown up by (and along with) Loomis. Neither did Loomis. Now, Myers is back, covered from head to toe in bandages, looking for his niece (that is, Laurie Strodes daughter), so he can once again murder one of the females in his family. Except this time she's just a kid. I wouldn't have much of a problem with this movie if it wasn't for me still clinging to the old Myers style. It's action packed, it's got a couple jump scares and a couple of somewhat creepy moments, and there's plenty of killing. Except the music isn't anywhere near as good as in Halloween 1 and 2, and the atmosphere suffers greatly from it. To me, the atmosphere was what made the Halloween movies special. Now, it's just another murder fest with a familiar character doing the killing.That all said, I still somewhat enjoyed it.

I loved the original and the 2nd one almost equally.Everybody knows the 3rd installment sucks cause it didn't even deal with the best villain in movie history.I've watched Halloween 4 : The Return of Michael Myers about 100 times cause I own 2 copies.  The Original VHS & the Special Edition VHS.  I'd like to start by saying this movie is a very good sequel to Halloween II.  I like the one-liners Dr. Loomis has in this movie, I loved Jamie Lloyd in this movie, I loved the way Michael Myers looked freaky in this movie, I even didn't mind the plot too much.The only flaw i'd say in this movie is some bad writing & the scene where Dr. Loomis & Jamie are hiding the schoolhouse and Michael pops up and he's got like a totally different mask on with white hair.  What the hell is that?  Such an obvious mistake, what were they thinking?One thing that sticks out with this movie is the ending.  I think Halloween movies have the weirdest endings in horror movie history.  I think all the endings to all the Halloween movies are original in some shape or form.  In Halloween 4 however, the ending is twisted.  We see Jamie kill her stepmom after being brought home by the police.  Now I never got this quite well. I don't know whether it was because she touched Michael and maybe his powers were absorbed into her or was it because she is part of Michaels family and the curse was brought down to her.  If you all don't know what i'm talking about, then you should read the Halloween novel by Curtis Richards.

299,wormtheace,What a waste!,5,3 September 2008,"Such a good ending wasted on such a bad movie. I never understood why people liked this movie. I guess Michael returns and that makes it acceptable. While some of the eerie Halloween flavor is still intact you can tell the story is running pretty ragged. Dr. Loomis spills out the same dialogue about Michael being pure evil. The towns people don't believe him at first then find out he's for real.Blah blah blah. You know where this goes. The only saving grace is the ending which is a mirror image of the beginning of the first. It would have or should I say could have breathed much needed new life into the series. It could have taken it out of the shadow the character Michael but alas. Just like in so many instances of this series they screwed it up big time. How may mistakes could one series make and still be successful? Well if you want to see all the movies go ahead and check it out but for me the only Halloweens worth a damn are Halloween, Halloween 2, and H20.",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
300,stephen-59,Who says all sequels suck?,8,11 August 1999,This sequel does not suck. The third one I hear does suck. But this one does not. It's got it's fair share of gore and some scary scenes. It's really good. Except at the end were they try to do in Myers. Yeah right like that would work!,Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
301,Gravedigger-2,A rather weak sequel,3,24 September 2000,"WARNING! Spoilers for the first two movies:
Let me start off by saying that this is a huge set up from Part III...though that isn't saying much. Truthfully, this movie is nowhere near as good as the first two.The plot is rather simple. Michael Myers and Sam Loomis somehow survived the fire at the end of part 2. Now...I find that kind of strange since I'd be hard for a human being to survive that. But don't you remember that Michael was blinded at the end of part 2? And all of a sudden, he can see?Anyways getting back to it, Mikey has been in a max-security prison for the last ten years. But since he's in a coma and he obviously isn't waking up any time soon **wink, wink**...they decide ""hey let's move him to the same institution that he escaped from on this very night ten years ago...he isn't going to do anything.""In real life, they'd probably be right. In a horror movie...bwahaha...idiots. Michael escapes and goes on another killing spree, stomping a B-line to Haddonfield, this time in pursuit of his cute lil' niece Jamie. It seems that Laurie Strode has tragically died, along with her husband, in a car accident about a year prior to the events in this film. Jamie is all alone in the world, being taken care of by her new foster family, including the lead in the film, Jamie's foster sister Rachael.Nice set-up, eh? Did I also mention Loomis is back in what may be his best performance in the Halloween series yet? Loomis is heavily involved in the beggining of the movie, but by the end he's almost non-existent. I think the flaws in this movie were not from the script, though it wasn't perfect.One was the acting. Danielle Harris was okay, Donald Pleasence was great, and Beau Star was passable, but everything else sucked. Didn't the Rachael/Kelly/Brady love triangle simply stink of 80s television?Another was that I didn't care for Dwight Little's style. He didn't capture the same dark feel that Carpenter and Rosenthal did, except for a few parts. Also it moves even slower than the first Halloween does and in effect, is less interesting. I also didn't like how Michael Myers was likened to Jason in this movie. Michael doesn't crush head. Jason does that. Michael doesn't stay standing after being shot the crap out of with assault rifles. Jason does that. See what I mean? Michael lost his scariness because he was simply too damn powerful. I will say that the ending was simply brillant, but overall if you have already seen parts 1+2, stop with those and forget about 3-7...Attendant-Jesus ain't got nuttin to do with this place.",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
302,James-russ98,Too unrealistic,4,31 October 2018,The fact he survives the explosion from the 2nd film just makes it unrealistic from the get go and to be honest it doesn't really get much better. Also the mask looks cheap and lame in this one and not in a good way,Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
303,PowerPadMan,THE best sequel to the blockbuster hit.,10,25 May 2004,"You heard it right. I think this is much better than the others.Why? Because of alot of things. First, let's go with the story. One of the reasons why this movie gets no good reviews is because of the story where Michael and Dr. Sam Loomis was burned. To put a rest to all of that, I'll give you the scoop. Originally, the beginning of this movie would have the burning hospital with Loomis coming out. The Fire department tries to put the fire out but Loomis would of said ""No! Let him burn!"". Unfortunatlly, it cost too much money to re-do that scene so it was dropped, thus hopefully ending all of the confusion.Now what was I saying? Oh yes, now, Michael is back. And as usual, he isn't taking any prisoners. Now, Laurie died in a car accident, so her daughter Jaimie (Probably an inside joke to Jaimie Lee Curtis) has to be taken care of by another family. Meanwhile, the mental instituion is about to take Michael away (With an EXCELLENT cameo by Raymond O' Connor, who makes alot of great quotes. Including one where you hear a mental guy screaming with the person picking Michael up saying ""Jesus!"" to which Raymond says ""Jesus ain't got nothing to do with this place"".). In the ambulance, Michael murders both the people picking him up, and the driver. Nice death in which he drives his thumb through a guys mouth and rams it again the wall repeatedly.Now, Dr. Loomis and Michael both meet up, and alot of deaths later, Micheal is once again gone, for now...I don't see why this movie doesen't get good reviews, the person in the Michael mask did an exceptional job here. As did the actors, with another great performance by Donald Pleasence. Honestly, I found this MUCH better than my original favorite sequel: Halloween 2. While 5, 6, 7, and 8 were mediocore films, this one comes out on top as the best of the sequels.Thumbs up, recommended,RATING ***1/2 out of ****",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
304,Halloween1247,Best Sequel To The Original Film,7,24 October 2015,"After Ten years in a fire coma, Michael Myers (George P Wilbur) escapes from an ambulance while getting transferred back to Smiths Grove. He sets out to Haddonfield to finish what he started back in 1963; however his newest target is his 8-year old niece since his sister Laurie died in a car accident. It is also revealed that Dr Loomis (Donald Pleasance) has survived the fire from Halloween 2 and continues to hunt after Michael.It is very unlikely that Loomis would have survived that kind of explosion but his return is certainly welcomed. Loomis seems tired and bitter after the events of 1 and 2 that is an interesting darker take on the character. Unlike in the original, Michael and Loomis cross paths on their way to Haddonfield and this time Loomis it able to speak to Michael before firing his weapon for the first time. Loomis trys to convince Michael to leave Haddonfield alone and even is willing to die for this. Although Loomis fails to convince Michael, knowing that Loomis would die for a town who hates him makes Loomis a much more likable character.Michael's new target and niece Jamie (Danielle Harris) is living in Haddonfield with foster parents because her parents died in a car accident between 2 and 4. Despite their exception of her, Jaime does not feel like she belongs. Jamie also seems to be literally haunted by her past as she has nightmares about Michael coming after her. It's impressive to see such a young child actress do such a good job playing a likable character who eventually goes down a dark path.Rachael (Ellie Cornell) Jamie's foster sister and babysitter plays the final girl role more so then Jamie does in this movie and she is okay. Cornell acts and talks like a teenager, but is not really all that great as a character. She does what she is supposed to do and that is about all. Unlike most survivor girls, who wait for someone to save them, Rachel fights back against Michael when she can.Michael Myers himself is a little disappointing. George P Wilbur looks to chunky and walks with this kind of lumber that looks like he just took a dump in his pants. The biggest problem with Michael is that god awful mask. It is too white and just looks so cheap, like they found the mask in garage sale bin marked ""Free Crap "". If Dick Warlock returned as Michael, the movie would have been nearly perfect. Also Michael seems hardly burned for some reason and that just seems like laziness on the director's part.Michael has never created so much fear in the town of Haddenfield before or after. He first takes out the phone lines and then destroys the town's power supply Michael then kills all the towns' police force, which leads a group of trigger happy rednecks to start patrolling the streets with shotguns. These rednecks succeed in nothing other than killing anyone who happens to be out on HALLOWEEN, because that is so out of ordinary.The film does a good job handling the gore. Halloween 4 does feature a lot more blood then the original does but is never becomes excessive. There are times when the murders aren't even shown, just the horrifying aftermath. The bloody ambulance, the ruined police station and the corpse of a dog say a lot more with a lot less.This film diverges for the more traditional elements of the series. The opening isn't an ominous Jack-O-Lantern, it is a farm decorated with Halloween decorations with no music to create an ominous atmosphere. The director also adds some action scenes, like a moving truck battle. Also the characters never stay in one place for too long. The story keeps the characters moving for location to location, which I find makes Michael seem like he is everywhere.Another scene worth mentioning is that Loomis gets a ride into town from a man named Jackson P Sawyer (Carmen Filpi ) who has been hunting an unknown evil for decades. It is interesting to see Dr. Loomis for once only listen and to see what he must seem like to other people. Sawyer also states that ""Evil don't die like a man dies"" foreshadowing the films ending.The movie ends with the state police shooting Michael relentlessly into what appears to be a grave site. Later the survivors of the film return to Jamie's house. Upstairs we see someone's P.O.V as they grab some scissors and murder Jamie's foster mother. The killer is revealed to be Jamie in her clown costume. The movie ends where the first one began, with a child in a clown costume holding a blade. This is in my opinion one of the most chilling endings to a horror film and works as a conclusion to the series.Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers is a well-made and well-paced horror film. The movie does borrow a lot from the first one, but it does not simply rehash the first movie as there is still enough new to make it its own movie.Worth a look if you enjoyed the first film 7.5/10 Did you know this is Peter Griffins favourite movie?",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
305,labemaster1,I liked it,7,16 February 2007,"Halloween is the best in the series. Halloween H20 is the 2nd best. Halloween 2 is the 3rd best. And Halloween 4: the Return of Michael Myers is the 4th best. That's pretty good. Anyway, Donald Pleasance reprises his role as Dr. Loomis in this film. Jamie Lee Curtis doesn't reprise her role as Laurie Strode in this one. Instead, we get a young Danielle Harris. She plays Laurie's daughter, Jamie Lloyd. (If you saw Halloween 2, you'll remember that Laurie Strode and Jimmy Lloyd fell in love at the end of the film). Apparently, Laurie and Jimmy were killed in a car crash and Jamie was adopted by the Carruthers family. I think my favorite death in this film was the electrician's death scene. He is thrown into the power lines. Anyway, the film is not worth buying. But, it's well worth renting. One more thing, don't see Halloween 5. For the love of god, don't see it. Just see this one.",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers

Stick with the first three. The third one is underrated. This one? This one is a generic boring mess.",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
307,jac-44480,Very Good Sequel That Overcomes Flaws,8,30 October 2016,"Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers is arguably the best sequel in the franchise, or at worst, tied with Halloween II for that honor. It is not in the same class as the original, but is a huge sigh of relief after the Michael Myers-less Halloween III: Season of the Witch, and is head and shoulders above later sequels.The movie starts off on shaky footing with several major plot holes from the events at the end of Halloween II that we must overlook. Most notably, that Michael Myers is still alive after being shot in the eyeballs and burned alive! Or that Dr. Loomis survived the explosion in pretty good shape with minimal scarring and a limp in his step. Additionally, we learn that Laurie Strode was killed in a car accident along with her husband, and that they are survived by their 7 year old daughter, Jamie Lloyd, who is Michael Myers' niece, and has since been adopted by the Carruthers family.The characters go to such great lengths to protect Jamie's identity, including changing her last name, to prevent Michael from finding out he has a niece. Yet everyone in the town of Haddonfield is aware of this secret including the kids at school, the Sheriff, and even the guards at Michael's prison, where the topic is discussed openly and freely in Michael's presence. You would think that somebody would have thought of moving Jamie to another state, perhaps into witness protection, but the characters are clueless. This is a major blow to the story's credibility.Another unbelievable concept to grasp is that Michael's prison transfer is scheduled on October 30th of all dates exactly 10 years to the day from his last escape, and that he is being transferred to the same sanitarium he escaped from originally! And inevitably, the transfer must occur late at night in a driving rainstorm with minimal supervision. Only a couple of incompetent paramedics are left to guard Michael as he is transported, and he easily escapes.Dr. Sam Loomis reprises his prior role and does not disappoint. He is every bit as good as in the first two installments and delivers plenty of great one liners. Dr. Loomis had basically no life outside of being obsessed with Myers for the past 10 years, and is in hot pursuit of Michael the minute he hears of the escape. Loomis tracks Myers down to a gas station where a confrontation ensues resulting in Loomis's car being blown up and Michael escaping.In usual form, Loomis's maniacal attempts to warn the citizens of Haddonfield go unheeded, and he is quickly dismissed as a lunatic. The only person who is remotely concerned is Sheriff Ben Meeker, the successor of the retired Sheriff Brackett, who is arguably better cast for the role than his predecessor. Meeker and Loomis have great chemistry as they initiate their hunt for Michael while all other characters remain completely oblivious to the threat.Meanwhile, Jamie is cared for by high school teen Rachel Carruthers, who is tasked with taking Jamie trick-or-treating on Halloween night. Jamie suffers from recurring nightmares of her uncle, and knows exactly what he looks like with his mask and jumpsuit, even though she has never seen him in real life. This is yet another unbelievable plot device that fails. Rachel is distracted by her love interest in local jock Brady, who is more interested in Sheriff Meeker's promiscuous daughter. Both Jamie and Rachel excel in their roles, and although Rachel is no Laurie Strode, she holds her own. The rest of the characters are passable but forgettable.The movie gradually redeems itself as it progresses. Michael begins to stalk local teens and quickly builds up his body count. The individual deaths are unremarkable, a bit rushed, and occur off-screen which deprives the viewer of gore. The pacing and suspense of the stalking scenes are very good early on, almost on par with the original Halloween, but these principles are abandoned later on.One complaint I have is Michael's mask, which is easily the worst mask of any Halloween movie. The mask in the original film was a Spock mask from Star Trek, and was very scary. The mask in Halloween 4 looks a bit cheesy and less scary. It is no wonder that in subsequent installments the producers went to a mask similar to the original film.The latter third of the movie is action-packed and thrilling. Michael attacks the local police station killing off almost the entire force and shuts power down to the town. The movie culminates with the characters boarding themselves up inside of a large house and Michael attacking the house, killing off almost everyone inside, before Jamie and Rachel escape barely. Loomis and Meeker are meanwhile off in the town trying to restore order as a pack of beer-bellies go on a wild goose chase to hunt down Myers. The beer-bellies almost save Rachel and Jamie, but are dispatched by Michael. The state police arrive just in time and shoot Michael to death (apparently) as he falls down into a mine shaft underground. Of course, nobody thinks to conduct a search for Myers' body and he is quickly accepted as dead. This sequence follows a long line of idiotic lack of logic or common sense we see in Halloween movies and other slasher films.The movie's ending is shocking and the best part of all. I will not divulge the details, but will say they were clearly setting things up for the next movie, Halloween 5. Unfortunately, when they made Halloween 5, they completely abandoned whatever ideas they had in store, which lessens the effect of Halloween 4's ending after seeing both films. Overall, Halloween 4 is worth watching again.",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
308,gabegiddens,Could've Been Better but Mediocre Instead,5,23 April 2018,"Halloween 4 is a decent film. Halloween III was actually a very enjoyable film but of course, fans craved for Michael and what we got was another run in the mill slasher film. Don't get me wrong, there are good parts in this film. Danielle Harris was great as Jamie and Donald Pleasence was once again fantastic, even if he was getting a little tiring and repetitive. I didn't like Rachel's character at first but she eventually grew on me. The music is fantastic but this film lacks the suspense of the others. Michael no longer looks menacing, instead he looks like a football player in a jumpsuit with a mask with the face of confusion. In the end, this film was fine, but could've been better.",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
309,william81-1,The Night He Came Home,7,11 January 2006,Halloween 4 fits somewhere between Halloween 1 and Halloween 2 with equal time given to both character development and equal parts terror and blood shed. Halloween 4 is a film firmly set in slasher mode which may disappoint fans of carpenters Halloween films as Michael displays many Jason-esquire tendencies that make and break the film in places. Like most slasher movies the actors smile and scream in the right and places and die like good piggies except for the brilliant Donald Pleasence who's Tortured Dr Loomis set the Halloween franchise apart from it's counterparts. Loomis steal every scence he is in and his tortured scream will leave you with chills. Halloween 4 is highly enjoyable and fun slasher movie that will appeal to fans of the genre rather than fans of the original films.,Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
310,haydentheroadhogmain,"Halloween 4: The Return Of Michael Myers"" brings the Halloween franchise back to its roots.",8,28 November 2020,"""Halloween 4 The Return Of Michael Myers"" is the fourth installment in the Halloween franchise. After director John Carpenter's attempt to make the franchise into a holiday theme anthology film series backfired, producer Moustapha Akkad decided to take the franchise back to its roots and make the fourth installment all about Michael Myers again. The fourth movie utilizes old tricks and formulas in order to bring back the Halloween feel into this movie. Its works hook line and sinker and Halloween 4 is not only one of the best films in the franchise it is also downright disturbing.Set in the fictional town of Haddonfield Illinois where ten years ago Michael Myers -George P. Wilbur terrorized the small town in search of his sister Laurie Strode- Jamie Lee Curtis, the night of the tragedy ended with Laurie being rescued and Michael presumed burned to death. A decade after the gruesome events Michael Myers suddenly comes back to life after his ten year coma while being transported to a sanitarium, while making his way to Haddonfield to continue his bidding long time nemesis and his former psychiatrist Dr. Sam Loomis- Donald Pleasance tries to stop him at a gas station but fails miserably. When Michael arrives at his hometown he finds out that his sister Laurie Strode died in a car crash, but she apparently has a young daughter named Jamie Lloyd- Danielle Harris who is living with the Carruther family and her foster sister Rachel Carruther- Ellie Cornell. Now since Michael knows that Jamie is family he then sets his eyes on her, and will stop at nothing in his way to eradicate his niece.Dr. Sam Loomis is outstandingly played by Donald Pleasance, he's a natural in this role, by this point in the franchise he's practically became Sam Loomis himself. The character's psyche is between the edge madness and normality, Pleasance portrays that part of the character really well. His acting nails the psychological aspect of the character well. Ellie Cornell does a decent job of portraying Rachel Jamie's poster sister, her character has a strong bond with Jamie, Cornell does a nice job of showing that her character really cares about her poster sister and treats her no less than a real one, she also does a great job as a pseudo final girl for the film, utilizing the clichés of that horror franchise she's managed to make her character relatable and lovable. Danielle Harries keeps up with the rest of the cast despite being on her first role along with a set of veteran actors like Donald Pleasance, she makes the audience care for her and want to see her character survive till the very end, with her role as Jamie being reprised in Halloween 5 and appearing in Rob Zombie's halloween remakes her face has become one of the most beloved characters in this franchise, she is definitely one of the better child actresses out there. George P. Wilbur is one of the best Michael Myer's out there, his portrayal of the character made fans cower in fear, he portrayed Michael as he should be portrayed a killing machine with no emotions who stops at nothing to achieve his goals, on top of that his body and figure made the character even more terrifying. Sadly enough Beua Starr, Kathleen Kinmont and Sasha Jenson portrayal of their minor roles did not hold a candle to the rest of the cast.Production rushed filming for this fourth installment of the franchise as a result the mask does not fit Michael instead it ends up coming off as a hindrance throughout the film since the mask looks too goofy for a character like Michael Myers. The gore and practical effects were turned down for the kills in fear of the movie getting axed by the MPAA, it's a shame that the end product are either off screen deaths or watered down kills. The movie is good as a whole, but it feels like a remake of the original 1978 Halloween film, since it has the same tone and atmosphere, follows the same formula, utilizes the same troupes and clichés of the genre and doesn't change anything from the previous films in the franchise recipe wise. Despite a couple of production issues and flaws, there are still a lot of good points about this movie. The cinematography and lighting really compliments the films dark tone and atmosphere, it gives the viewer a sense of paranoia and makes them feel like nothing will go right for the main characters of the film. The pacing is really good for this film as well, the events and the transitions don't feel rushed, and that makes the story flow really nicely throughout the film. The score is always great since John Carpenter never disappoints with his classic Halloween score, the score highlights the dark tone of the film, and makes the audience feel like they are in the character's shoes since it matches perfectly with what is displayed on screen and the film as a whole.Despite this being a cookie cutter slasher film it actually has a moral lesson. That moral lesson being that family members even if they're your poster family must always care and be there for each other's side, since they're the only ones who can be there for them during their times of need. Sometimes even horror movies have beautiful lessons and morals, that's why it's important to never judge a film by its genre alone.This film is a R-rating despite the gore being nonexistent which is disappointing in its own right, since it might put off some long time fans of the horror genre. This film is only suitable for adults and people over 18 according to its MPAA rating. The audience for this movie are most likely going to be horror fanatics only since this film was made in 1988 which is a really long time ago. Long time fans of the horror genre will love this film, but the new generation sadly won't. The average movie watcher should not let those factors get to them though if they're looking for a good horror movie, since this film is still fantastic and scary in its own right.

8/10",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
311,Mlinville817,"Ten Years Ago HE Changed The Face Of Halloween, Tonight HE'S BACK!",8,21 January 2011,"Well I thought Michael Myers and Dr. Loomis died in the explosion at the end of Halloween II. I guess I was wrong. Halloween 4 brings us back to Haddonfield and I'm happy to be back.Michael Myers has been in a coma for ten years. Doctors are transferring Michael from a clinic to a different hospital. But Michael wakes up and goes back to Haddonfield. There he's going after his 9 year old niece Jamie Lloyd. But Dr. Loomis knows he's out there. So he tries to stop him (as usual) and save Jamie.First off the acting is great. I love Donald Pleasance and was happy to see him back. Newcomer Danielle Harris who is only 9 years old delivers the second best performance in the whole film. Usually it's hard to cast a kid but the crew struck gold with Harris. The rest of the cast had great chemistry. They are well acted. We actually get to know the character before they get killed. John Carpenter is completely missing, the only thing is the score, but the series is in good hands. The film has an eerie feel to it. Director Dwight H. Little brings a sense of atmosphere to the film and creates a number of suspenseful scenes. He is able to build suspense and not just go for the cheap thrill which the Friday the 13th Series did, which the second movie also did. But this one goes back to the suspense and isn't a gore fest. The deaths are bloody but they're different and not just the usual knife or hospital items. There are many intense scenes in the movie. First off a car chase with Michael on top of the car, and what I think is the best scene in the whole movie, Michael chases the stars on the roof of their house. It's very suspenseful and very intense. Also the ending is shocking and one of the best endings in a horror movie. I won't give it away but I was surprised. While it's flawed and not perfect I really enjoyed it. It was better than Halloween II and better than Halloween III. I liked seeing Donald Pleasence back and I liked going back to the Michael Myers story. 3 stars (out of 4 stars)",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
312,Moonlit_Sorcery,"Excellent, on par with the original!",8,1 May 2006,"Halloween 4 definitely deserves a higher rating. It's an excellent horror movie, and on par with the original.Basically, the psychotic knife-wielding serial killer with a cheap dime store mask is back and terrorizing the town of Haddonfield, Illinois once again. This time he's after his adorable seven year old niece, Jamie (Danielle Harris), and anyone who gets in his way. Jamie's teenage foster sister Rachel (Ellie Cornell) eventually grows to care for her and tries desperately to protect her. As the entire town is placed under lockdown in the search for Michael, a group of drunken rednecks pile in their truck and try to take matters into their own hands by finding Michael themselves. There is also a subplot dealing with Rachel and her cheating boyfriend, Brady. The movie is very entertaining, and a little frightening at times, but at the same time it can be hilarious. At the end of the movie, we see Michael trying to possess little Jamie, and the story is continued in part 5 (which isn't as good but still pretty good).Overall, 4 is the best in the series after the original.",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers

315,horrorfan1023,Best of the Halloween sequels,9,14 July 2008,"In my opinion (being a die-hard Halloween fan, I think that ought to account for something, blast it) this is hands down the best sequel in the series. Michael recaptures the malice he had in the first one, and is in some ways meaner and more evil than he was in the first two since in this one he is after a little girl; his own niece no-less.Donald Pleasance gives an outstanding performance as Dr. Loomis, who's crazier and more determined in this one. Danielle Harris did a fantastic job as little Jamie, the girl deserved an award for her performance, just like Mr. Pleasance. Ellie Cornell did a decent job as the older, protective foster-sister. Dwight Little gets two thumps up from me for this excellent entry into the story of Michael Myers.",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
316,LasPlagas96,Michael is back,5,6 November 2018,"After the in my opinion underrated part 3, they continued with 4th installment bringing Michael back. It begins with Michael well being alive escaping during a transfer to Smith Grove. Dr Loomis also having almost noting but a little scar after being exposed to a huge explosion in part 2 which would be improbable to survive, immediatly chases Michael on his path to Haddonfield.
The role of Jamie, Michaels main target, was very well played by young Danielle Harris. The other characters also were not bad played. You also see Tommy and Lindsey, the kids from the first movie reappear.
What bothered me a bit was during Michael killingspree it almost seems like he has the ability to vanish like Batman or teleport (for example at the gas station or in the truck in the ending scene)
The shootout at the end at Michael was satisfying to see, similar to the one in Jason lives.
My opinion on the ending was a bit mixed, it lets you play with the thought that in the sequels Jamie goes around in a mask killing people. Although in the following sequel Jamie isn't the new Michael.
But Donald Pleasence's ""No, noo, noooo"" to the scene was amazing!
I'd give it a 5,5/10 if you could rate in decimals",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
317,deepblueseajaws,Halloween 4: The Rebirth Of The Series,8,30 May 2006,"Halloween 4: The Return Of Michael Myers is one of my favorites in the series aside from the original Halloween, Halloween II, and Halloween III: Season Of The Witch. The story takes place ten years after the events of Halloween and Halloween II, in which Dr. Loomis and Michael Myers survived the fire. Of course, Michael has been in a coma for the time, but he soon wakes up while being transported to another facility and heads back to Haddonfield leaving a trail of bodies and Dr. Loomis is close pursuit behind. The acting and script are good, especially Donald Pleasence's performance as Dr. Loomis. Danielle Harris's performance as Michael's 8 year old niece is great as well! And the opening credits displaying the farm and that creepy music are just great! You'll have to see this one if you haven't already!",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers

He returns to Haddonfield in pursuit of his new target and niece. Jamie Lloyd, the daughter of Laurie Strode.The town is very eerie in this film. Instead of being like a haunted house movie, it's more of a haunted town movie. It's a new vision on the movie series all together.Danielle Harris does a WONDERFUL job for her age. Though I find it overly sadistic that Mike is trying to kill a little girl now, It makes for a much more enjoyable movie to know that this little girl knows how to carry out that fear we like. Not to mention good screamer!I was a little upset Jamie Lee wasn't in this movie. But the acting in this movie isn't terrible.

I guess it could be an okay movie to put on whilst doing something else.What I like :
character development of the babysitter was goodWhat I don't like :
the ending was very weak in my opinionthe kills were all pretty bland, none of them were that memorablethe setting has already been done and therefore it didn't feel as though it added anything newit was a bit harsh to have to watch a kid go through all of thata bit boring.",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
321,docain,Bone-Chilling!,7,27 February 2002,"I went and saw this in the theater when it first came out. It was the 1st Halloween movie I'd seen and I was so impressed that I've rented it several times since. *THIS MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS* The atmosphere starts out creepy right at the beginning, as an ambulance makes its way along a dark, twisting road to the Ridgemont Federal Sanitarium, where Michael Myers has been in a coma since being set on fire at the end of Halloween 2. While en route to another hospital, he overhears the ambulance crew referring to his niece and comes to life, savagely killing the crew who are trapped inside.During the night, that niece, Jamie Lloyd, who lives with another family, spots an ambulance outside her home, and then after going back to her room discovers Myers is hiding in it! When the lightning flashed, showing him standing in the mirror, I just about jumped out of my skin! An interesting bit was where he appeared in the doorway, immediately after Jamie saw him sitting up on the other side of her bed. Loomis's first encounter comes after he & his boss find out that the Illinois State Police have discovered the wrecked ambulance that was carrying Myers, and Loomis heads off to a gas station where Myers has acquired his traditional coveralls and wicked-looking knife. The part that spooked me the most came when Jamie was standing in front of the mirror, holding up the clown outfit. Suddenly the image in the mirror changes to that of a six-year-old boy who murdered his sister in 1963, and Myers himself appears behind her as he pulls down his mask. This mask is different from the first two, but I found it more frightening because the hollow, dark eyes give the impression that there is no human inside it. The ending scared me as well, because it left an unanswered question  -  was Myers 'reborn' or somehow connected to his niece another way? Donald Pleasance remains effective as the psychiatrist trying to stop the apparently demonic Michael, along with the new sheriff Meeker and Ellie Cornell (what a sweetheart!) as Jamie's half-sister Rachel. This one lacks the graphic gore of Halloween 2, and it seems that director Dwight Little has tried to stick to Carpenter's original formula. For the most part he and his crew have succeeded. It's better than most of the Friday the 13th ones in that you don't see most of the killings - only the end result. Definitely on a par with the first two and probably better.",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers

The things that could've been done differently/better: the mask he wore was pretty terrible looking and cheesy. They had apparently killed off Laurie Strode without giving any explanation behind it whatsoever? The story line, although pretty good, lacked some depth behind it.

324,Zom-Lassic,Zom Lassic's HALLOWEEN 4: THE RETURN OF MICHAEL MYERS review,6,1 November 2017,"Yes he has returned, because that's what the fans wanted, but Michael Myers has returned in a pretty average, but still kind of satisfying sequel, that could have been better, if John Carpenter or Jamie Lee Curtis, were involved, they are not, and the movie sort of sufferers for it. Danielle Harris is very good in the lead, and Donald Pleasence is always fun as Dr.Loomis. The problem with movie is probably the director, really didn't know what he was doing. The idea of putting Michael Myers hiding in the backseat of a car, and the guy driving doesn't notice, is pretty ridiculous if you think about it, Michael Myers is not a small guy. Also some of the slow motion shots are unnecessary, and sort cheesy, and some of the characters are pretty dumb, especially the vigilante group, who turn out to be worst than Myers. Halloween 4 is not scary at all, but it's still kind of fun to sit through. Some deaths are good, some deaths are even pretty gruesome. But the film still feels kind of empty for some reason, like the guy behind the camera is not really excited about directing a Halloween movie. It doesn't really have a style like the 3 Halloween movies before it, nothing inspired in its look, it just looks bleak, period. I don't like the Michael Myers mask look, the gun shots sound weird to me, the explosion at the gas station should have of been louder, instead it sounds, like it went mute there for a second, and no one bothered to fix that problem, very strange. And how do the cops know if Myers is in one place, if they are clearly in another, and no one can tell them that Myers is over there, this happens close to the end, I just don't get it. But Harris and Pleasence's performances are truly worth watching, and the one thing that really stands out here, is the very haunting, extremely effective ending that really sells this movie here, and if the producers had any brains, could have made a really great part 5 of it,using this exact idea, instead Halloween 5 is downright terrible. But Halloween 4: The Return Of Michael Myers, is still entertaining, and sort of fun, see for what it is, which is not much. This could have been better, but I still liked it.",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
325,Shauna63,John Carpenter Tried To Tell Them!,5,1 November 2021,Carpenter never planned for sequels to the original Halloween. He envisioned an anthology series where each film would be a completely different story centered around Halloween. He tried to tell the producers there was nothing more to say about Michael Meyers but they wouldn't listen. He begrudgingly did Halloween II and ugh...it definitely shows. Finally they let him tell a completely different story in Halloween III but people were pissed when there was no Michael. Sigh.

That it is far from over !! You could actually feel the tension rising as soon as the first scenes are launched, like hailing winds before all electron fusion hell is unleashed. And where to go after the beginning? Well, this is the first time in history , where citizens of Haddonfield , with the local sheriff department, gets a fair warning way before pure hell arrives, to their little town...However, this warning will unfortunately go to deaf and ignorant ears.. Because white people just don't seem to think something like this could ever happen... This serves a proof and archetype of a white man , who is actually too smart for his own good .We are victims to our own success ,because all the technology and advanced weaponry, what exist. We still find ourselves be over powered and brutalized, by one crazy maniac... And that having some primal survival instincts would serve a more profound purpose in a long run ..Also there is some doubts ,where people don't seem to think that Michael is capable, to produce this kind of fear and terror ( given the logical reasoning & facts ) But that will turn out to be terrible mistake. And there will be hell to pay, for all those oblivious people ,afterwards.. It don't matter who you are ,Michael is going to crush you're head ! GAME IS OVERAnd let me guess .

In fact, I put it up there with the original and the first sequel, but now that I go back and look at it... it just doesn't cut it. 1)  A serial killer is being transferred in an ambulance from one max. security hospital to another with absolutely no security.  There are 2 drivers and 2 paramedics.  Sorry, that's just not how it's done.  Chalk it up to bad writing...2)  Michael, all burnt up, is just wandering around the general store, freaks out the little girl, and no one notices him standing around--entering or exiting with a mask on?  Walking across the street back to his tow truck? Hm.3)  There is no all out search for this oh-so dangerous serial killer. Dr. Loomis is the only one who seems to care and he just kind wanders around the whole time.  It's obvious that Michael would go back to Haddonfield, yet there is no security or manhunt whatsoever.  Again, bad writing.4)  The geniuses lock themselves in a house when the power is out, expecting the serial killer not to get in.  Oh my... they did have cars, they could have driven to the next police station.  Haddonfield wasn't an isolated little town in the middle of a freakin valley somewhere.  It was a pretty big place and there had to have been a town nearby.5)  Michael takes out everyone at the police station.  What, did they just stand around as he attacked each one of them individually?  Sure, the all had guns and police training, but Michael had a butcher knife.  He flayed them, no contest.  Riiight...6)  They're actually trying to nurse Michael back to health?
7)  Okay, when the power goes out in a town... someone is immediately called to fix the problem.  Oh, I know.. because the writing is so mediocre the power outage really adds to the suspense... *cough*  But really, 5 minutes from the time it went out someone knew would have been out there, pulled the corpse off the power conduits, thereby letting the juice flow. 
8)  So Michael, just hearing about his neice in the ambulance, hearing only her name... suddenly has the ability to track down where she and her foster parents live so he can drive his badass ambulance there and park it outside in very scary fashion.  Michael must be omniscient.Skip it and rent H2O.",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers

After What happened to Myers and Dr. Loomis in Halloween 2, and after watching Halloween 3, I thought that Micheal was definitely Dead. So I was surprised by his comeback After 10 years of his death (and 7 years from the screen) And the Most Surprising was Dr. Loomis comeback!! I really was shocked on how he survived that explosion back in 1978. And Even More shocking was the end! Seriously! I thought That Micheal wasn't dead after the Police shooting, And I thought it was him in the house at the end. But when I saw Jamie holding the knife, I began screaming like Dr. Loomis and was like wtf just happened.All in All, Great Movie! Amazing comeback!

The best sequel besides Halloween II and H20. The music for this film is by Alan Howarth. I love the music to this film. I can actually go out and buy the soundtrack and listen to all of it in enjoyment. I could listen to this soundtrack, the first soundtrack, 2nd, and 5th with enjoyment.

I didn't even bother to watch 3: I imagine it was a good film, but the way I see it, no Micheal: no Halloween!The original is easily the best, and H20 is, while not nearly as good, a very faithful sequel. However, I hadn't yet seen H4, which I had heard was good. Last week I got the chance to see it, and believe it when they say it is one of the better sequels. The first thing you'll notice about the film is it is quite more violent than the original, like H2. Unlike H2 however, it still has the creepiness factor of the original, and does have a decent story and reasonably good acting (Donald Pleasance is on top form again, and hats off to Danielle Harris for a great performance) You can pick it up for really cheap now on DVD(I got it for £2.50), there are no extras to speak of, but both picture and sound quality are good, so its worth a rental at least, because I would advise Halloween fans to at least check it out!",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
341,yolkie,Probably the best sequel,8,21 August 2005,"After Halloween 3, the Akkads decided to go back to the Myers storyline. This film saw a change in writer because Carpenter didn't really want anything to do with it after Halloween 2 - he didn't really want to be involved in that, either.Halloween 4 is one of my favourite movies. It's my favourite Halloween sequel, obviously it's not as good as the original, but no-one expects that. It was a brave decision to make this film as with no Carpenter or no Jamie Lee Curtis I imagine this would have had a mixed reception.Halloween 4 succeeds where many of the other sequels failed with one basic move - most of the characters are characters you grow to like, and anyone who's seen Resurrection and to some extent H20 knows what I mean.Danielle Harris plays the role of Jamie Lloyd, daughter of Laurie Strode. Her role as the terrified niece of a deranged serial killer is quite magnificent.Donald Pleasance is back as the slightly maniacal Dr Loomis. In my opinion it is the presence of Pleasance that made these films possible and on the whole watchable. He plays the role as brilliantly as ever, managing to deliver some of those classic, almost camp, lines - ""Maybe nobody knows how to stop him"", one of my favourites.Without wanting to give too much away, this film follows a very simple formula that is similar to the original, complete with a mysterious ending that will leave you wanting to watch Halloween 5.One of the most important films to watch if you're a fan of Halloween. In the event you haven't seen Halloween, then I wouldn't recommend this film as a starting point as you would probably find some of it confusing.

Halloween 3 is much better because that movie has personality and creativity, sure it's silly and dumb, but at least it tries to be something other than a cashgrab, unlike Halloween 4 which just lives off the name Michael Myers.

343,JDash10,Halloween 4: The night that RUINED everything,9,4 June 2006,"After the shocker(but not a good one) that was HalloweeN III, Moustapha Akkad knew he had to resurrect Myers. Throw in a couple that has sex, a crap teen cast and an average killer in a mask along with a b.s. plot and you have HalloweeN 4.After being burnt to a smoking pile of bones at the end of Halloween II, Myers and Loomis ended the series there for 7 years. When Myers was madly asked for from fans, the Akkads decided to make Myers come back in style. So why didn't he? Well folks, here's where the spoilers start. You have been warned...Myers didn't die (? His fiery skull was seen at the end of part II), he just fell into a coma for 10 years. He is about to be transferred from the sanitarium he has been housed in when, surprise surprise, he breaks out. He tails his 7 year old niece Jamie and plots to kill her. Lee Curtis intelligibly jumped ship after II, so they had to bump her off in a car crash with her husband. That is all that is mentioned. No bloody explanation or anything. Jamie is Lauries daughter, and so Myers uses the 'kill-all-family-members theory' to make her a target. Danielle Harris and Donald Pleasence are the gems in the acting crown here, which says a lot. Yes, you read that right. Pleasence makes a return as Loomis, which is impossible as he was in the middle of the explosion at the end of II. The only blemish on his face is a not-so-severe burn mark. But the thing that ruined 4 for me was Myers. The mask is a poorly customised Will Shatner mask which isn't scary at all, and Myers is an average killer. Yea, no leaping out of shadows and scares here, just him walking about and turning menacingly. Jesus, even that jerk Ghostface from Scream woulda done a better job. After seeing Myers get shot down an old abandoned mineshaft, the film ends with Jamie butchering her mother wearing a clown costume scarily similar to that of childhood Myers' getup. The whole thing echoes the opening scene of the original perfectly, as Jamie stands atop the stairs, grasping bloody scissors in her hand...I give this film a 3. 1 mark for Harris' acting 1 mark for Pleasences acting and 1 mark for having the balls to bring Myers backOnly watch this if you are bored on Halloween night and you want a cheesy film to get on with.",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers

If you watch a film with the title Halloween 4, you know its not going to be Citizen Kane and as the critics have remarked how the sequel was responsible for the decline of the horror/slasher movies in the mid eighties then H4 is surely guilty as charged. However H4 is not the worst film in the series.The acting is mediocre and the script is littered with some horrendous dialogue(Check out Dr Loomis`s description of Michael Myers as ""Evil on two legs"") but hey, lighten up, this isn`t Shakespeare. H4 to an extent delivers the goods. Its short for starters, were not waiting an hour for the action to begin, its straight into it after a classy opening credits sequence. The characters are stock horror movie characters  and thus we can relate to them. The gore is kept to a minimum (is that a good thing?) and there are a few minor shocks and twists along the way. The late great Donald Pleasance is at his eye bulging best and the film treats us to some dark humour involving some vigilante Rednecks out to nail Michael Myers but for me the major plus of this film is the John Carpenter penned music that was so well used in the first film. Surely this is one of the great movie theme tunes in history. In a nutshell H4 offers us nothing new but you pay your money and you get what you expect, a standard run of the mill low budget horror flick. hey I quite enjoyed it but don`t you think that Myers bloke is putting a bit of weight on.",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers

""Halloween 4"" gave horror films a much needed boost when it came out back in 1988.  The slasher films of the eighties had all become carbon copies of one another and were growing more and more stale.  The makers of ""Halloween 4"" obviously saw this and tried to inject some moments of genuine creepiness into it and for the most part, they succeeded.  While still coming nowhere close to the original, ""Halloween 4"" makes up for the blandness of the second one and the total absence of Michael Myers in the third one.  Focusing on the dark, supernatural elements of the first one, the film turns into a violent roller coaster ride with plenty of suspense and a lot of carnage (but surprisingly little gore).

This is a decent sequel with plenty of holes, like when the good guys are trapped in the house, I guess they couldnt break open a window or break down the front door. Then theres the scene where Michael is after Jamie and Loomis in the schoolhouse. He throws Loomis through a window and the shot clearly shows Michael with a different mask then he wears through the whole movie, I guess they lost the first mask.  The movie is long on holes and silliness but is still pretty entertaining, so I would recommend it overall. Afterall, it is a Part 4.",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
349,shape87,"Good, despite being the fourth.",6,10 November 1999,"In Sweden, Halloween 4 and 5 don´t exist! But i borrowed it from a friend who bought it in England. This is a good one, even though it´s the fourth in the series. But sometimes, it could get silly (a fall from three stories causes just a few scratches). Despite this, it´s the very best since the first!",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers

351,jedidonjuannick,Good flick,6,21 December 2006,Well it was a good movie as far as slasher flicks go. I don't think it had the same vibe as Halloween 1 and 2 . but it was far better then the Halloweens that would come later .I would watch it at least a couple times a year just to have a little fun. but if you are a serious fan of the Halloween series you know that 1 and 2 were the best films .Saying all of that if you want to have a good night of just sitting around in the dark and watching horror movies all night this film would not be a bad one to put on and enjoy.and you might even get a jumb out of your girlfriend or wife. My girlfriend always jumps during this film.,Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
352,sabianr,One of the better sequels,8,12 September 2021,This is definitely an improvement over 2 and 3 with an ending that'll shock you.,Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
353,yanisinr,A nice surprise,8,20 September 2021,I've heard mostly bad things about all the sequels after Halloween 2 but it his was pretty good. Not as exciting or fast paced but I actually found it more interesting than Halloween 2.,Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
354,halokec,Very controversial opinion,8,8 October 2021,I think this is the best Halloween sequel until H20. Written well with decent direction and acting.,Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
355,damiene-79906,Almost as good as the original,8,14 October 2021,"This is the best Michael Myers sequel up to this point, featuring a return of great characters, a good story and lot's of genuine suspense throughout. With a shocking ending you won't see coming.",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
356,efilleymainer,The best sequel!,9,25 June 2007,"After the first one, I thought all the rest were going to suck. But not this one. This takes place ten years after the first movie, and Michae survived that explosion and only got into coma. He heads back to Haddonfield to kill Laurie's daughter, Jamie. Silly premise, yes but the movie is well made and made me jump here and there, not totally scared me, but hey, you know all the tricks. A definite DVD to buy! The extras are great as well. You have a making of, HALLOWEEN 4/5 convention dealing with 4 of the cast members. Then some trailers. Sure, nothing fancy, but great none the less. And, almost forgot, a commentary done with the director and the writer.",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
357,Bartzy32,An attempt,2,2 December 2002,"I saw all of the Halloweens in which the order they were released (including 8).  After seeing the first two the into this whole side story didn't cut it for me.  It had a somewhat decent story and acting, but the atmosphere didn't quiet hit the mark.  I did love the fact that they went back to the basic scare tactics that John Carpenter used.  There is one scene with two of the charachters that were trapped on a roof with Michael.  That whole scene was great.  During this movie you feel for the charachters.  The things I didn't like were  the guy who played Michael Myers.  He couldn't get th walk right.  It looked like he was walking with a really bad rash. They could have found a better person, I mean this guy had to wear shoulder pads.   I guess I could say it was a somewhat worthy sequel.",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
358,slade09,Why?,1,2 September 2010,"The actual path of return of Michael Myers has been long and painful. Before he had time to release a completely unnecessary and does not have the slightest relation to the TV series sequel, drove him to his grave in half a decade. But, obviously, wanting to earn some money on the old brand, the producers decided to resurrect the dead in a blazing inferno killer. Now, actually about the movie itself: absolutely nothing remarkable, besides still very overextended slashers, completely lost its unusual aura of the first two films. Still, if the first two parts have saved some special mystery, starting with the fourth part, epic madman in a mask becomes a banal ""murder, yell, run, at least, the fourth and fifth parts dropped exclusively in this way . The end of the movie so generally quite shamelessly licked the fifth ""Friday-13"", published three years earlier. The only thing that somehow saves this film from failure - a good game is pretty aged Donald Plizensa, probably, he was the only person for whom somehow worried and do not want to be quickly killed.",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
359,pacman_000,Best Horror movie ever,10,17 July 2005,"This great sequel, in my opinion, is an improvement on its legendary original. It involves former characters, great new characters, good Midwest Halloween feel, good suspense, great action, superb acting, amazing writing, and the wild card which is the involvement of the citizens of Haddonfield. After 10 years in the hospital, recovering from the injuries he suffered in Halloween 2, Michael escapes while being transfered between hospitals and quickly starts off on the same foot he left off on. After trying to kill his sister, Laurie Strode, in Halloween 4, he goes after her daughter and his niece, Jamie Lloyd. Rachel Corruthers (played by Ellie Cornell) is her step sister who protects her from Michael. Cornell gives one of the best acting performances I've ever seen. But, the highlight of this great film is the performance gave my Donald Pleasance who reprises his role as Dr. Loomis, Michael's former doctor. Loomis, who is burnt and has a bad leg, tracks Michael from the beginning of the film, after hearing of how Michael's ambulance crashed.PLEASE buy this movie. If you don't like it, you can personally complain to me at pacman_000@hotmail.com enjoy",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
360,benfrancis-40945,Halloween 4: the return of Micheal Myers,10,2 April 2018,"Halloween 4 is one of the best films within the franchise, with its simple storyline and great scenes, matching the basics of the original. Danielle Harris shines as Jamie, and Ellie Cornell is amazing as Rachel becoming the hero in the end. Donald's plesences returns as doctor Lumis and does one of his greatest performances in this entry. The plot flows nicely, and the cast and characters are highly likeable, which makes you root for them in the end, making the movie more suspenseful and engaging. Some of the best scenes are the rooftop chase, the gas station scene, the truck scene and the cliffhanger ending.",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
361,MRTRAMP,"GOOD FILM, FULL OF WEIRD INBREEDS... I mean the local people, then there's Micheal MYERS",7,1 November 2005,"OK I'll admit it. So far the only Halloween films I've seen are HALLOWEEN H20: 20 YEARS LATER which didn't really impress me, and this one. Though I'll probably be seeing the others soon.THE GOOD BITZ ABOUT HALLOWEEN 4Lotz of suspenseThe action was intenseVery Cool endingFairly Good plotTHE BAD BITZ ABOUT HALLOWEEN 4The moments before the kills. Myer's would be about to top some1 then he'd disappear half-way down the road. Then go back up to them 2 kill them. WHATS THE POINT!?!?!?!!?Too many inbreed localsNear the ending. Micheal Myers absorbed loads of for a while. And the stubborn muthafucker still comes back in Halloween 5..... and 6..... and 7.......Acting: Except for D.

People don't see that it's a cheap attempt at a sequel even though it had a higher budget than the original movie, absolutely garbage.",Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers
