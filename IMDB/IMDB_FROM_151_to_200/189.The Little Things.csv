0,SnoopyStyle,three big actors,6,2 February 2021,"It's 1990 southern California. A young female motorist is harassed by a mysterious muscle car. L.A. Sheriff's Department homicide detective Jim Baxter (Rami Malek) investigates a murder. Kern County deputy sheriff Joe ""Deke"" Deacon (Denzel Washington) happens to be in town to retrieve evidence for another case. He's a former detective from LASD but left after some unspecified incident. He finds Jim's case to be connected to his former case. The two starts to suspect Albert Sparma (Jared Leto) who drives a muscle car to be a serial killer.This is trying to be Se7en and True Detective and other high concept crime mystery with a twist. It's interesting in some aspects but falters in others. First and foremost, this is not a whodunnit. The movie piles on all the suspicion on Sparma with only a small wink at the fingerprint guy. Quite frankly, it's either Sparma or not Sparma. Anyone else would be meaningless anyways. There is some hope of turning this into a character study of these three people. That's a 50/50 proposition in this case. Denzel can sleepwalk through this role and I'm not saying that he is. I'm also not saying that he isn't. With Rami and Jared, the film has two of the most outlier actors around. It may be one too many. They are pushing very hard and at times, they push the movie over the edge. Finally, I have issues with the final confrontation. There are problems with it and I don't like it. Nevertheless, I still like the three actors and it's always interesting to see them go to work.",The Little Things
1,nogodnomasters,Finish the job,8,14 February 2021,Deke (Denzel Washington) is a detective who returns to California to deliver evidence. He works his way into a case similar to one that ate at him five years earlier which he never solved. He teams with Jim Baxter (Rami Malek) the man who replaced him. Jared Leto becomes the main suspect and enjoys being a suspect.Deke has the typical unique way of doing and seeing things like Colombo or Kojak as he is sometimes called. The fun is watching them work going through the police drama motions.Guide: F-word. Corpse nudity. No sex.,The Little Things
2,classicsoncall,"""It's the little things that get you caught.""",7,14 April 2021,"I think the naysayers for this movie are somewhat missing the point, the story behind the story as it were. Yes, it's a murder mystery, but beyond that it's about Joe 'Deke' Deacon (Denzel Washington) attempting to prevent fellow law officer Jim Baxter (Rami Malek) from falling into the same depressing frame of mind that's been his personal torment for the past five years. In an admittedly very dark scene in the latter half of the picture, a flashback depicts how Deke accidentally shot an innocent person in the course of hunting down a murderer. Deke's guilt over the fact, even after a coroner fabricated the cause of death, was enough to force him into an unintended leave from the department and the breakup of his marriage. Landing a position in a lesser capacity at a police department in a nearby county, Deke gets involved in a murder case when he's sent on a gopher mission to pick up evidence in Los Angeles. He gets a mixed reaction from his former colleagues, while initially getting the cold shoulder treatment from Baxter, a hot shot detective with the slightest hint of superiority.As the serial murder investigation in LA appears to narrow down to a likely suspect, both Deke and Baxter seek to make the pieces fit against the slimy Albert Leonard Sparma (Jared Leto). Sparma manages to outmaneuver the pair of frustrated cops with an infuriating display of conceit and arrogance, leading Baxter to try a different approach. Sparma's insistence that a murder victim is buried in a lonely desert location leads Baxter to dig up nearly a dozen parcels of empty dirt. With his frustration and anger mounting, Baxter decks Sparma with a shovel, unintentionally killing him. Deke, who was present and witness to the Sparma's death, returns to the city in Sparma's vehicle to cover Baxter's tracks. In doing so, Deke reveals a dishonorable side to his character, especially with his advice to Baxter to 'forget about' Sparma and move on with his career. To pinpoint blame where both cops thought it should have belonged, Deke buys a red barrette that one of the murder victims wore, and has it delivered to Jim in an attempt to assuage some of his guilt. One's sense is that this won't be enough to relieve Baxter's remorse for acting impulsively, his sense of self worth completely shattered by the experience.The idea that Sparma was guilty or innocent of the series of murders in LA and Fern County is left an open question to my mind. He may have been the killer, but with no tangible evidence, he felt compelled to inflame the pair of cops breathing down his neck. If you paid attention, the film's sound track seemed to support the idea that Deke and Jim were on the right trail. Not only did Deke have a fondness for nostalgic Sixties music, but the ones heard on the radio in Baxter's car included 'My Guy' and 'I Will Follow Him', affirming the idea that they were soon to get their man.",The Little Things
3,BandSAboutMovies,"Somewhere, I am still watching this",3,3 February 2021,"IndieWire's review of this movie compared it to Seven, which is not only lazy, but it's the most basic of all connections: young hotshot white cop teamed with world-weary black cop to find a killer who keeps eluding the police. Except that, you know, Seven* is the kind of movie that will live on in cinema lovers' minds for, well, ever and this movie won't stay in your brain longer than it takes to watch it. Hopefully.Ah, HBO Max. For all the sturm and drang and handwringing given over to your plan to play movies at the same time they make it to theaters. Well, between this and Wonder Woman 1984, they're exactly zero for two.The comparisons between the films went the whole way to interviews with writer and director John Lee Hancock, who claimed that he wrote this way before Fincher's movie forever transformed serial killer procedurals. It was originally to be a Clint Eastwood vehicle and then a Steven Spielberg movie and then, well, it sat around for some time.This movie is set in 1993, which you'll know because there's a No Doubt flyer on the victim's fridge but not because the lead detective's house looks like it was built last year. That time incongruity is the least of this film's problems. In fact, if you told me it was set in 2020, I'd believe you just as quickly as if you'd say 1993.Joseph ""Deke"" Deacon (Denzel Washington) is a man whose detective career has ruined his life and the lives of everyone around him, pushing him away from Los Angeles and into the outskirts of town, dealing with crimes as simple minded as the Black Angus Restaurant continually needing to replace the g.While back in the city to pick up evidence, Deacon comes into the orbit of the man who replaced him, Detective Jim Baxter (Rami Malek). You know how that works, what with people being able to move from county to county on cases, jurisdiction be damned.There's a killer painting ip his victims and that killer might be Albert Sparma (Jared Leto), who fits every expectation of what a loner killer should look and act like. But is he guilty? He's an unreliable suspect who is so obsessed with criminal behavior that he confessed to a crime he could have never committed once before.So what do two good - we hope they are - men do to put away one bad - we hope he is - man? A lot of nothing, as it turns out.Far be it from me to condemn movies where nothing happens for long stretches of time. That would pretty much describe 99% of the drive-in and grindhouse movies I love, which feature travelogue footage, unnecessary b-roll and long go nowhere scenes that follow each performer each time they walk anywhere.This film somehow feels longer than five of them in a row while overdosing on Klonopin.The thing is, if this were a small budget film with no name actors, it wouldn't make a blip on the rader. But this feature three acting powerhouses and a well-considered writer and director at the helm. And for all that gasoline in the tank, the car is going nowhere fast. And even worse, the car is not special nor does it possess anything that you haven't seen in every other car that looks exactly like it.I realize that not every movie can rock your world. But they should at least try. This has Leto playing, well, Leto. At least I hope that he didn't send used condoms and dead rodents to Denzel and Malek like he did to his co-stars in Suicide Squad.Also, and this is a silly complaint, but I couldn't understand a word Malek said. In Bohemian Rhapsody, I chalked that up to him having to get teeth like Freddie Mercury. I can more easily divine what Bane says than his character in this movie.Movies can be dumb. They can have plot holes. They can have horrible special effects, bad continuity, laughable performances. But the worst thing a movie can be is boring. And I fear that this entire day has all been a dream and somewhere, I am still watching this movie and will soon find myself waking up to having to watch it all again.*I know I'm supposed to write this as Se7en but that makes my fingers hurt.",The Little Things
4,CinemaSerf,The devil is in the detail...,6,9 June 2021,"I was quite intrigued by the trailer for this. Somehow, though, they seem to have managed to squash all that's interesting about the film into it... It reminded me a great deal of ""Se7en"" (1995) with Denzel Washington ""Deke"" a former detective with a history that resulted in him being relegated to a rural uniformed role. He is despatched to the big city to collect some evidence whereupon he becomes embroiled in an investigation led by the cocky ""Baxter"" (a rather wooden Rami Malek) into a series of brutal killings. The title of the film is the gist of Washington's character - he is methodical and detailed in his methods, and together this unlikely alliance starts to bear fruit - they get their suspect, but he (Jared Leto) is no fool, and soon the game of cat and mouse leaves us uncertain as to whom is pulling who's strings. The first half-hour is quite well structured and effective, we get a sense of the mystery and the two stars gel quite well together. The second hour of the film, though, is really pretty poor with an ending that I felt really let the whole thing down. Any semblance of plausibility is sacrificed, almost as if director John Lee Hancock felt he was running out of time so had to cram too much into the closing stages - and so we are left with a hastily cobbled together conclusion that really underwhelms. Not a film you need bother seeing in the cinema - it is bound to be on a streaming service shortly to help you kill 2 hours.",The Little Things
5,zardoz-13,Procedural with a Sour Grapes Finale,8,9 March 2021,"""The Blind Side"" writer & director John Lee Hancock has made his homage to director David Fincher's gruesome serial killer thriller ""Se7en"" (1995), co-starring Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman. Not only does Hancock's thoroughly suspenseful film ""The Little Things,"" starring Denzel Washington, Rami Malik, and Jared Leto, surpass Fincher's cult classic, but also its content is not as graphic. Despite its powerhouse cast and its surprise ending, ""The Little Things"" amounts to a psychological exercise in detective work more than a physical actioneer, jam-packed with bloody shootouts and careening car chases. Two unlikely detectives who've never met join forces to catch a murder suspect. The irony is the suspect yearns to be caught. Just watching these three actors in the same movie is worth the price of admission. Jared Leto steals the show with his sinister laid-back performance. Unfortunately, the sour grapes ending may prove less succulent for law & order enthusiasts. Nobody wants to watch a period police procedural where the cops don't solve the case. Of course, you watch movies like ""The Little Things"" because you want the cops to nab the criminal. Instead, Hancock defies our expectations and depicts the police in a less than heroic light. So it should come as no surprise that most audiences will feel cheated? Clocking in at two hours and seven minutes, Hancock's offbeat neo-noir crime thriller smolders with suspense. Suddenly, everything goes sideways, with a shocking, double whammy of an ending which both stuns and amazes. Most mainstream serial killer sagas, such as Michael Mann's ""Manhunter"" (1986), starring William L. Peterson, salute the cops who catch their quarry. When the authorities fail, the filmgoing experience feels less fulfilling. Movies like ""The Little Things"" with atypical endings constitute 'arthouse epics' because they don't aim for the mainstream.Joe Deacon (Denzel Washington of ""Training Day"") was a high-profile Los Angeles Sheriff's Department homicide detective until he made a tragic mistake in the line of duty five years ago. Without spoiling anything, this exposure may bias your sentiments about Denzel's character. You'll have to bide your time for those revelations when they come during the final quarter-hour. Meantime, the bottom dropped out of Deke's career. He lost his two daughters because his wife divorced him. Later, he survived triple-bypass heart surgery! Afterward, he landed a patrolman's job in Kern county. ""The Little Things"" revolves around truth and consequences. Once an illustrious detective, Deke lives alone now on the edge of the desert near Bakersfield, in Kern County, California, about 100 miles from Los Angeles. Deke's boss Captain Henry Davis (Glenn Morshower of ""Black Hawk Down"") sends him back to his old stomping grounds to retrieve crime scene evidence. When he enters his old precinct, Deke gets the cold shoulder from his former boss, LASD Captain Carl Farris (Terry Kinney of ""Sleepers""), who wants him off the premises as soon as possible. While he is hanging around, Deke spots his replacement, Sergeant Jim Baxter (Rami Malek of ""Bohemian Rhapsody""), a fastidious dresser, conducting a press conference about a serial killer who has slain four women. Initially, Baxter isn't impressed with plain Joe Deacon. In fact, Baxter almost had Deke's GMC truck towed for blocking his unmarked car. Meantime, Farris warns Baxter that Deke is a ""rush hour train wreck."" As it turns out, the evidence is wrapped up in red tape, so Deke must spend the night. Nevertheless, conflicted as he is about the older detective, Baxter befriends Deke. He invites him to inspect his latest crime scene involving a woman slaughtered in her own apartment. Deke may be a persona non grata, but he's still a shrewd detective. When he visits the crime scene again, Deke asks about the broken fridge. The landlady explains the girl died before the repairman came to fix it. Afterward, Deke prowls an appliance shop and develops a lead: a stringy-haired, pot-bellied, grease monkey, Albert Sparma (Jared Leto of ""Dallas Buyers Club""), who resembles an unkempt Jim Morrison.The two obsessed detectives struggle to build a case against Sparma. Eight years earlier, Sparma confessed to a murder. Nevertheless, the authorities threw out the case because they couldn't link him to the crime scene with physical evidence. Moreover, they caught Sparma lying about his part in the homicide. When the LASD brings him in for questioning, Sparma toys with them and calls himself ""a crime buff."" Amusing himself, Sparma plays a game of cat & mouse with Deke and Baxter. He enjoys looking at the crime scene photos of the dead woman. Deke realizes Sparma is ogling the photos lasciviously. Slamming him against the wall, Deke accuses Sparma of the dead girl's murder. Jared Leto's impassive villain doesn't fight back, and he ambles out of the interrogation room. Later, Deke convinces Baxter to distract Sparma long enough so he can search the low-lifer's apartment. When Baxter doesn't keep his rendezvous with the slippery repairman, Sparma rings 911 and alerts the LAPD about a wounded officer who has been shot on his premises. Scrambling out of the apartment and over the roof before several uniforms raid Sparma's place, Deke manages a narrow escape.""The Little Things"" isn't sympathetic to the police. Not only do the boys in blue blunder, but also their blunders pose serious blowbacks. Ultimately, they emerge from their game of cat & mouse with Sparma no better than criminals because they conceal their own crimes. Ironically, Hancock penned this procedural back in 1993, when life seemed far less complicated before the COVID pandemic. Anybody who has seen ""Se7en"" will spot the unmistakable resemblance between Rami Malek's young, hot-headed detective, who flies into a rage at the least provocation, and Brad Pitt's fledgling, loose cannon investigator. Each behaves like judge, jury, and executioner. Mind you, despite its less than savory ending that armchair sleuths will abhor, ""The Little Things"" remains a superbly crafted film without any of the gruesome violence in ""Se7en.""",The Little Things
6,Calicodreamin,Slow,4,3 February 2021,"I think this was supposed to be a slow burn, but it ended up just being slow. The characters didn't feel genuine so I wasn't emotionally involved in the story. The ending 'twist' wasn't very powerful and just served to mop up the mess made by a poorly thought out serial killer plot.",The Little Things
7,view_and_review,My First Movie of 2021,6,22 February 2021,"""The Little Things"" is a rather subdued drama about an older man haunted by his demons of the past and a young man trying to solve a big case. The two of them cross paths at the L.A. County Sheriffs Department where they just may be able to help each other.Denzel Washington plays Joe Deacon, a Bakersfield P.D. deputy who used to be an L.A. County homicide detective. He was sent to L.A. to pick up some evidence and found himself right in the middle of a murder investigation. The anonymous murderer preys upon young women. The case is being handled by a hotshot young detective named Jimmy Baxter (Rami Malek) who doesn't mind the help of an old veteran like Deacon.The movie is more about obsession and letting something consume you. Deacon had been obsessed with a case and it drove him to a divorce and a heart attack. He would obsess over everything, the big and the little things. Baxter, now having a widely publicized case, was also beginning to get dragged in too deep with some help from Deacon.This movie had some fine performances from all involved. The pacing was good for a murder mystery. I'm not quite sure what I was looking for from this movie, but I don't think I found it. This was decent for my first movie of 2021, though not quite my bag as Austin Powers would say.",The Little Things
8,ferguson-6,what haunts you,6,30 January 2021,"Greetings again from the darkness. When a script has bounced around Hollywood for 30 years without getting produced, there is usually a good reason why. Written by John Lee Hancock in the early 1990s, a handful of directors have been attached at various times, but it's the writer himself who has managed to get it on screen all these years later. Mr. Hancock has found his niche as a director by targeting the precise middle of mainstream with such films as SAVING MR BANKS (2013) and THE BLIND SIDE (2009), an approach more challenging when the topic is chasing a brutal serial killer.Of course, casting three Oscar winning actors is always a wise choice. Two-time Oscar winner Denzel Washington (TRAINING DAY, 2001, GLORY, 1989) stars as Joe Deacon, a defrocked L.A. homicide detective banished to the California desert as a Deputy Sheriff in Kern County. ""Deke"" suffered a heart attack, went through a divorce, and lost his job as a result of being haunted by an especially grisly unsolved case. When Deacon is tasked to pick up evidence in Los Angeles, he stumbles into a case being worked by his hotshot replacement, Jim Baxter. Oscar winner Rami Malek (BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY, 2018) brings his unorthodox mannerisms to the role and soon (and unsurprisingly) the 'old school' and 'next gen' detectives are teaming up to work a serial killer case with (unsurprising) similarities to Deke's old case.Denzel is especially effective in the first half of the film. His Deke is a quiet man with extraordinary observational and listening skills, and he brings none of his patented histrionics to the role. Deke's 'little things' process quickly identifies a suspect, and it's a doozy. Oscar winner Jared Leto (DALLAS BUYERS CLUB, 2013) is Albert Sparma, a greasy-haired appliance repair man (who let's this guy in their house?) with a penchant for following news of the city's crimes. Soon enough he's taunting Deke and Baxter, and enjoying every minute of their frustration at the lack of evidence. It's the cat and mouse game we've seen many times.I'm a fan of retro movies, and Hancock announces upfront that this one is set in 1990. There are two reasons for this: that's the era when he wrote the script, and it corresponds to a time when the Night Stalker was fresh on the minds of L.A. citizens. (side note: Netflix is currently showing the superb docuseries, ""Night Stalker: The Hunt for a Serial Killer""). The idea of mismatched partners with polar opposite personalities is another aspect that we are quite familiar with, and Hancock even uses flashbacks to show us exactly what haunts Deke.Supporting work comes from Chris Bauer, Terry Kinney, Glenn Morshower, Natalie Morales, and Michael Hyatt, with the latter two providing a non-victim female presence - although neither is given much to do. The most interesting aspect of the story is how Baxter is falling into the same emotional void as his new mentor, but unfortunately, not much time is devoted to this. In fact, the story has very little to keep us interested, and instead that burden falls to Washington, Malek, and Leto. Hancock has delivered a dark, brooding crime thriller that fails to deliver the thrills. It certainly pales in the obvious comparisons to David Fincher's Fincher's SE7EN (1995) and ZODIAC (2007), but is fine for killing time while stuck at home during a pandemic.

9,bombersflyup,Nothing here.,1,31 January 2021,"The Little Things is the worst film Denzel's been involved in, unless he did a comedy with Kevin Hart of course.I don't even know what this is... they both killed someone, the end. This Malek guy's terrible, he just stares the whole time, like one of Michael Shannon's expressions. I fear for the upcoming Bond film he'll be in, the weak dialogue and woeful direction didn't help. Jim gets into the car and then does whatever Albert wants him to do until he becomes enraged. Albert could have killed him at any time as well. Such an empty nothing of a film.",The Little Things
10,gradyharp,'It's the little things that get you caught',8,30 May 2021,"John Lee Hancock (The Blind Side, Snow White and the Huntsman, Saving Mr. Banks) wrote, directed and produced this strange film that in ways appears to be a parallel path between two law enforcement officers who have deep scars from their own performances in the line of duty.The plot, loosely related - Joe 'Deke' Deacon (Denzel Washington), a burned-out Kern County, CA deputy sheriff, teams up with Jimmy Baxter (Rami Malek), a crack LASD detective, to catch Albert Sparma (Jared Leto), 'a serial killer.' Deke's keen sense for the ""little things"" proves accurate, but his willingness to circumvent the rules pushes Baxter into a frightening dilemma, while, Deke must wrestle with a dark secret from his past.Washington, Malek, and Leto give fine performances, aided by some stand out support by Michael Hyatt (wholly credible in her role as a medical examiner bonded to Deke), Chris Bauer, Terry Kinney, Isabel Arraiza and more. There is a problem with the writing and the directing in that the storyline wanders and the impact of Deke's former actions that mirror Baxter's current obsession lessens as the film flows on: both beg for some tightening in execution. The concept is solid: the end result is flawed. Grady Harp.",The Little Things

Denzel Washington, Rami Malek and most certainly an almost unrecognizable Jared Leto did a great job playing their characters. There's also a good amount of suspense which keeps your attention. That said the ending isn't really a satisfying ending. I'm glad I'm not the only one that thinks that. There was clearly something missing in the last part and that's a pity because The Little Things could have been much better.

14,FeastMode,awkward across the board,2,7 February 2021,"What was that??? this movie makes you appreciate things in movies that you normally take for granted. so many aspects of this movie are incompetent. the musical score is almost non-existent except for one theme they use during scene transitions. the story, which is already completely basic, is told in such an awkward and discombobulated way. so many things were confusing, not because they were too complex, but because they just didn't flow right.but the worst parts of this movie were a combination of the editing and the dialogue. it was soooooo awkward throughout. there were numerous times where i couldn't tell who was talking. there were scenes where one person was talking but the sound and volume completely changed between sentences. and the strangest thing was the flow of the conversations. the pauses between characters speaking was so odd. it's like they wanted to have fast quippy conversations, but they accomplished this by cutting out the gaps between responses. one character would respond IMMEDIATELY after the other finished his line. it sounded so unnatural. i repeated so many parts to confirm. it happened throughout the movie.other than being an extremely low-quality movie in every aspect except the cast, this movie was just boring with zero intrigue that goes nowhere interesting.

15,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,Misfiring crime noir caper,4,19 July 2021,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningIt's the early 1990's, and a serial killer is roaming through Los Angeles. Kene County Deputy Sheriff John 'Deke' Deacon (Denzel Washington) is a burnt out cop, who pushed himself to a heart attack after becoming embroiled in a case, who finds himself sent down to LA on a simple evidence gathering assignment, only to lock horns with hotshot young LASD detective Jim Baxter (Remi Malek) who's eager to make an impression. Deacon ends up lending his expertise in catching the killer, only to dredge up a dark secret from his past.No genre staple in the thriller department has ever proven quite as inexhaustible as the serial killer plot line. No end of fresh takes on the theme continue to saturate the literary and film worlds. And here writer/director John Lee Hancock delivers his contribution to the screen, that passed by without much fanfare as the cinemas cautiously reopened again. And, despite the best intentions, that ultimately might be just as well for everyone.On the surface, all the right ingredients are in place to have a decent stab at a worthy effort at reworking the formula to produce something memorable, but the result is a dull, uninvolving effort that fails to tread any new ground or generate any sense of tension or suspense. At its considerable length, that's a real problem. Even the usually energetic Washington doesn't seem to be feeling it, with more dynamism from rising co star Malik, who still doesn't quite have the star gravitas to get top billing over his co star. There are subtle nods to superior sk films from times before (such as the girl driving and singing at the beginning, a la Silence of the Lambs) which only adds to its woes, and by the end Hancock's pretentiously trying to aim for some film noir vibe, infusing some old soul classics over the soundtrack, apparently sensing the mystery itself isn't captivating enough.While the lead protagonist might theorise how it's the 'little things' that ultimately lead to cases being solved at the non-payoff of an ending, in reality it's sadly what leads to films not being the sum of their parts. **",The Little Things

Terrified she leaves the car and tries to hide in the brushwood while her pursuer ponderously searches for her, walking like Frankenstein's monster and carrying a lantern in his hand...It's a reasonable, if hardly original beginning to the film. Next morning, still unsure of the girl's fate, we're introduced to Denzel Washington's middle-aged, workaday uniformed cop, Joe ""Deke"" Deacon, performing gopher tasks for his truculent boss. We learn he's a live-alone burn-out, transferred and bumped down the ranks for reasons which become clear later. When he's sent to the big smoke to pick up some routine item of evidence he encounters Rami Malek's young hot-shot detective, Jim Baxter, who's investigating a serial killer. More young women are either disappearing or turning up dead, recalling to Denzel the unsolved case which broke him five years ago. After the obligatory testy first encounter between them, the two hook up with Malek inviting Washington to the latest murder scene where, naturally, Washington, in his unconventional way aids the investigation and with his fetching task no longer required, makes a busman's holiday of some holiday time he's due, to join Malek's team.It's not long before a prime suspect moseys into view, Jared Leto's Manson-like Albert Sperma and Malek becomes convinced that he's their ""boy"". But is he and if so how to prove it? Leto's character is slippery and into playing games with both detectives, but who will crack first?The film has the slow-burn dark pacing we've seen several times before going all the way back to ""Se7en"". There's little new ground covered in that respect but the film does have an interesting ending in its depiction of the processing of guilt. I found it heavy going at times and didn't swallow some of the narrative turns, like when Washington breaks into Leto's flat and most particularly at the climax with Malek and Leto doing that drawn-out Harry Potter v Voldemort stand-off thing at the dead of night in the middle of nowhere. On the other hand, I did like the device of Washington's ""ghosts of cases past"" speaking to him.Washington and Leto put in strong performances, Malek slightly less so. I also felt the direction could have been tighter but did appreciate the atmospheric soundtrack which helped to heighten the tension.More about the psychological than the thriller, in the end it might have been better served by beefing up the latter at the expense of the former.",The Little Things
17,MOscarbradley,Even the starry cast can't save this one.,4,31 January 2021,"Another serial killer movie more ""Se7en"" than ""Zodiac"" but nowhere near as fresh as either despite having three Oscar-winning actors heading the cast. An unusually subdued Denzel Washington is the slightly grizzled older cop, (been there, done that), Rami Malek is the young detective desperate to shake off any resemblance to Freddie Mercury and Jared Leto is the probable killer. It's a slow, handsome-looking film, so determined not to be sensational that it veers towards the dull side. The writer and director is John Lee Hancock so I guess the blame lies largely with him.Denzel's character, the great detective whose intuation is almost superhuman, is a cliche too far; he's now the right age to channel his inner Morgan Freeman while Malek is just sleep-walking through his role. Leto, however, is outstanding, giving the movie a much needed kick as well as a touch of class, acting his co-stars off the screen though that fine and underrated actor Terry Kinney gives a lift to his few scenes as Malek's boss. Still, despite the cast and John Schwartzman's superb cinematography this could be just another episode of ""C.S.I. Crime Scene"". A real disappointment.",The Little Things

It having the uninspired quality of a 1990s lesser crime drama variation of ""Seven"" (1995) to it (indeed, it was originally written and appears to be set in that decade), I could imagine being satisfied waiting a few months to rent a VHS copy of it, or not seeing it at all. Starring Denzel Washington, Rami Malek and Jared Leto, there's a lot of Oscar-winning talent wasted here. Washington gets one brief characteristic outburst during an interrogation where he seems to break character to play the caricature of himself he often plays, but for the most part everyone is relatively subdued. It's a run-of-the-mill serial killer murder mystery with hardly any artistry to remark upon. Even the supposed ambiguities or uncertainties are uninteresting. The little things of this genre piece may be there, but there's no bigger picture to validate it.",The Little Things

So ""The Little Things"" is basically his ""Se7en"" but no spoilers and surprises - it is far from being good as ""Se7en"" - very far.""The Little Things"" is nice little ""who dunnit"" movie with nice little ending, that was a bit surprise, but nothing to write home about. I think it was strongly acted by three stars, and basically their great work elevated this material from being anything less.Overall, ""The Little Things"" is not a bad movie to see it once.

The direction which was made by John Lee Hancock who is also the writer, it was good and he created a nice movie with many in tense scenes while he also presented very well the history of his main characters. The interpretations of both Denzel Washington who played as Joe 'Deke' Deacon and Rami Malek who played as Jim Baxter were simply amazing and their combination I believe that worked very well.

26,cruise01,Decent thriller but does keep you guessing and leaves you feeling unsettled.,7,30 January 2021,3.5 out of 5 stars.The Little Things is a pretty fair crime thriller film with an amazing cast performances. Music score. And unsettling tone that film leaves you feeling afterwards. The plot is decent and the direction follows every other crime film cliches.The plot follows two detectives Baxtor (Rami Malek) and Deacon (Denzel Washington) who are on a hunt for a serial killer. Who has been murdering young girls and displaying them in poses. When they suspect it may be Sparma (Jared Leto). It comes down to a cat and mouse as the two detectives are trying to discover evidence while Sparma is keeping an eye on them.For a crime thriller it does have its cliches. Two detectives who are obsessed with this serial killer. Deacon having a past he has yet to overcome with the murders. Which still keeps him up at night. While Baxtor is obsessed in stopping this killer from harming anyone else. The film does keep you guessing when they are trying to find evidence from Sparma. They surveillance his place. Track his movements. While Sparma is keeping an alert out for them. There is a twist that will keep you talking about the movie after it is over.The direction is slow moving. Two detectives spending more time talking about there pasts than focusing on any leads with the investigation.The cast ensemble is great. Denzel Washington. Rami Malek. And Jared Leto will keep your eyes on the screen with there performances. Three talented actors does make this film worth watching. It may lack thrills. Or be slow. But definitely worth the watch for there performances. Leto does play a creepy character that makes you feel unsettle.Thomas Newman music score is beautifully done. If it was not for the decent cliche plot and boring direction. This film could have been something more.,The Little Things
27,zkonedog,"Great Atmosphere, But It Just Doesn't Work Like It Should",7,8 February 2021,"There are a lot of things--pardon the pun--that ""The Little Things"" does right as a film. It creates a great atmosphere of tension, sets up an intriguing serial killer mystery, and has a lot of commentary on the nature of police work and its potential repercussions on the human psyche. At the same time, however, ""The Little Things"" also resembles a jigsaw puzzle where certain key pieces are out of place, disrupting the whole picture.For a very basic overview, this films focuses on Joe Deacon (Denzel Washington), a police investigator working in Northern California. On an assignment, he is tasked with driving to LA, where he sort of bumps into a new murder case similar to one in his past that compelled him to pull out from the big city. He teams up with new hot-shot detective Jim Baxter (Rami Malek), and when the duo stumble upon eccentric suspect Albert Sparma (Jared Leto), the mystery deepens as to Sparma's guilt or innocence.In a very basic sense, ""The Little Things"" is built upon a very solid premise. It's a great murder mystery, at face value, yet when one pulls back some of the layers it is also a meditation on the lengths that police officers can/should go to solve cases and live with themselves in the process. There are sometimes where I can easily convince myself that this is more like an 8-star effort at very least.That being stated, there is something to be said--and not a good something--for the fact that none of this deeper thinking really transpired during the viewing experience (only afterward upon listening to a few podcasts and reading some reviews). In other words, I have a sneaking suspicion that the execution of the themes was far weaker than their actual worth.A big part of the problem here was that so many scenes were more distracting than engaging. For example, a thrilling opening chase the begs for resolution almost completely fizzles from disuse. The use of flashbacks in Deacon's life are often confusing, as are the multiple murders/victims. Even as a very plugged-in viewer, I often had difficult figuring out just ""what was what"", so to speak. This really becomes a problem in the endgame, where (without spoiling anything outright) it is clear that the resolution is much more about character than plot. It's almost as if the whole movie was a distraction (intentional or not) from the overall point to set up the nonconventional ending, yet that distraction was too, well, distracting to the movie-watching experience as a whole.Overall, I ultimately settled on this as a 7-star movie. It held my interest and kept me engaged until the very end. Denzel and Malek are solid, while Leto's antagonist is genuinely creepy and intriguing. There are also a lot of deep, meaningful themes thrown around. Yet, unfortunately, such themes don't work nearly as well as they should due to some rather odd storytelling techniques. A good-but-not-great effect was the result for me.",The Little Things
28,eddie_baggins,"It's the ""little things"" that let this middle of the road thriller down",6,18 February 2021,"Just like the things it speaks about in its title and throughout its tale of Denzel Washington's complicated ex-detective turned small town deputy Deke Deacon teaming up with Rami Malek's up and coming LA detective Jim Baxter working together under the radar to track down a serial killer stalking the county, its the little things that hold John Lee Hancock's previously delayed Se7en wannabe from being the film it might have been had all elements within lined up better.Based on a script that was finalized way back in the early 90's (and potentially the main reason why this film is set in the era), Hancock's film may star three Oscar winning leads, be based upon a fairly intriguing central set-up and feature more mood than your average mid-tier thriller thanks to its night-time drenched façade and Thomas Newman's moody (if sometimes out of place) score but this is the very definition of an ""almost"" film that remains watchable throughout, but frustrates in equal measure as we eagerly await the film to become the product it may've been.There's nerves early on that The Little Things may be victim of a generic offering that never gets to grip with becoming something more thanks to a opening segment straight out of the direct to video affairs that littered the era in which it was set but for a while as we follow Washington's Deke to LA and get caught up in a serial case that brings him back to his previous involvement with some similar killings, everything appears to be on course for an effort worthy of the talent involved but thanks to some off the boil ""little things"" in the film like some shoddy editing (pay close attention to a scene set around a breakfast table or a drive down an LA freeway at night) and a miscast Malek as the confusing Baxter, the film struggles under the weight of its potential that is squandered rather than reached.It's not a horrible film by any stretch of the imagination, Washington is as solid as he always is and there's fun to be had with Jared Leto's prosthetic clad and scenery chewing murder suspect Albert Sparma but throughout the slowly paced film there's a distinct lack of character development or stand out scenes that would've made the film really buzz, while a disappointing outcome to constant insights into Deke's past feels underdone as does the films fairly horrible final act.These type of thrillers often build to big crescendos that sometimes require the viewer to suspend a little bit of disbelief and give the film some room to Hollywoodize its outcomes but nothing about Hancock's finale sits too well, even if the films insistence on not spoon feeding its viewers every little answer or detail about who has done what and why they have done it is a nice, against the grain component that gives this tale some weight for one too ponder once the credits have finished rolling.Final Say -A could've been film that never gets the most out of its set-up or its capable stars, The Little Things should have been a new genre must-see but as it stands is merely an adequate thriller with nice moments littered throughout an otherwise mismanaged feature.3 watch batteries out of 5",The Little Things

NOT a direction to be heartily applauded, neither is the photography to be applauded, nor the editing, nor the soundtrack. All these technical details which can elevate a film beyond the average, are simply not present here. This director John Lee Hancock has made many movies before that just did not cut it. He is known for making many movies before that are lackluster, not bad, but simply lacking spark or excitement.This is a detective story. A murder needs to be solved. This story has been told so many times before. The brilliant and classic movie 7even comes to mind often, when watching this movie, but everything in The Litte Things is without much suspense or spark and feels like a cheap copy of the brilliant movie 7even.Not any good? Denzel Washington is still the man. He still delivers a good performance. He alone can carry this movie on his own and he does, but it is not his best performance. A bit lack luster. Jared Leto is brilliant in his creepy role, although his character isnt mesmirizing or thrilling either.Conclusion: The Little Things simply fails to become a gripping detective, but it is still not a bad movie either, perhaps one that is best suited for an older arthouse audience, which has got the patience to watch a CHARACTER PORTRAIT of a police officer with a hunted past.",The Little Things
33,jtindahouse,Stylish and classy but missing the ending I wanted,7,1 February 2021,"I've often said you can tell how good a film is going to be by its opening scene. The opening scene in 'The Little Things' is quite indicative of the type of film it turned out to be. It's an extremely stylish scene, with an intriguing suspense set-piece set up - and then it just ends and comes to nothing, very much like the rest of the film does. I've said it before, I love an ambiguous ending, but not on every occasion. Some films demand more.I think the reason I struggled so much with this film being inconclusive was that I never for a second bought Jared Leto's character as being the killer. I understand some did (and some are even adamant that he was), but he never fit for me. If I was on the fence about his guilt then the ending probably would've worked for me.Thinking back on the film, it doesn't actually have a lot of action sequences (if any at all). It basically just relies on some very well written dialogue and three terrific actors to carry it. And I'm okay with that. The pacing felt a little on the slow side consequently, but not enough to ruin the experience.'The Little Things' had such a promising start and middle that I think I got my hopes up too high for the ending. It's a film that does share a lot of similarities with 'Se7en' and as we all know that has one of the best film endings of all time, so possibly that played into my expectations subliminally as well. Sadly, it couldn't deliver the knock-out punch I so badly wanted it to.",The Little Things

This movie is not your typical police drama. I can see why some people might not like it-the ending, in particular. The movie was okay-probably because of the star power-but a little slow at times. Denzel plays a former Los Angeles detective that is now a Kern County Deputy Sheriff. Why the demotion? Is he burnt out or did he do something wrong? When Denzel has to pick up some evidence in LA, he runs into some former friends like police captain Terry and some new ones like detective Rami. Rami is heading the investigation of a serial killer and soon discovers that Denzel, with his level of experience, may be of help in his case.

Real film stock for a real film. The music is also really nice too.No cell phones or technology, just a good old fashioned murder mystery with Amazing performances & characters. I've missed these types of films!!!!Reviews have compared this to ""Seven"" but i preferred this movie a million times more!!!! I can't stand boring brad pitt.I so miss these types of simple Detective Thriller's as everything is pretty much c.g.i overload.There's a comfort & sense of Nostalgia to this movie.Denzel is a movie star legend & a king of these types of Thriller's & is once again fantastic in his role of a tormented cop named Deke, who can't let go of his tragic past with his case of a serial killer. Denzel is simply incredible. You feel for Denzel & see what this case has done to him. A tormented & broken man who is disturbed by this case so much so that he suffered a heart attack, split from his wife & left his job as a leading Detective to become a deputy at the sheriffs office in a quiet town. Denzel gives one of my favourite performances here.Malek is also fantastic as the young, ego centric hot shot type of Detective named Baxter, who basically took over from when Denzel's character left that police department to Live a quieter life as a deputy of a small county.He's abit arrogant at first but soon works really well with Denzel's troubled cop & become close in a student & mentor type of way. Very interesting relationship. Also Baxter is a family man & you see how this case starts to haunt him & become an obsession just as it did Denzel 5 years before him. Fantastic acting from Malek.Also Jared Leto is excellent as a maybe or maybe not serial killer? A very weido performance as Sparma & so interesting. All incredible & memorable performances.The look of 1990 is beautifully captured on screen & everything looks so 1990!!!! Incredible production design & cinematography. Los Angeles is shot in away that makes it look beautiful, lonely & sinister all at the same time. The atmosphere is thick with fear & i got that real crime drama feel while watching it.Very interesting & powerful story as we see what these types of horrific murders do to the Detectives that work these cases. It gets in their heads & some cases aren't solved ever & some are solved but disturb those investigating them. ""Little Things"" is a real character driven story & gives us 3 incredible actors to carry it all. Better than ""Zodiac"" & better than ""Seven"" in my opinion, as others have compared this film to those!!!! Also as a period piece i liked this way more than Tarantino's Once upon a time in Hollywood.We have those 3 incredible actors & their relationship as it unfolds, the two Detectives & the weird suspect & what will happen? Is he a killer? Well things don't play out how you think or want them too & that's why this isn't an instant ""CLASSIC"". It didn't end how i would've liked admittedly but this was different & very surprising!!! It's damn well made throwback to the old Thriller's we miss in todays mega budget super hero world of cinema.Quality acting & a very intriguing story about the human part of solving these types of crimes that hurts your soul.""The Little Things"" is expertly written, directed & acted.

43,kluseba,Gripping neo-noir crime drama with excellent lead actors,9,31 March 2021,"The Little Things is an excellent neo-noir crime thriller that takes place in California during the nineties. The movie follows Joe Deacon, a sheriff that retired from the Los Angeles Police Department under controversial circumstances and now works in a rural county. However, the county isn't as peaceful as one might expect since there have been a series of grisly femicides that suggest that a serial killer might be on the loose. Joe Deacon is sent to Los Angeles for a routine job but he gets entangled with a grisly femicide. When he learns that similar crimes have been committed in the area in the past, Joe Deacon gets convinced that the cases in his county and the murders in Los Angeles might be related. This suspicion soon becomes an obsession. Joe Deacon is met with criticism and even hostility by some former colleagues but young detective Jim Baxter appreciates his dedication, experience and instinct. The two men soon realize that they have more things in common than they initially believed as their investigation finally gets a break. Repair store worker Albert Sparma is a crime buff living in the area of the crime scenes in Los Angeles and turns out to be a sociopath who taunts the police. Joe Deacon and Jim Baxter start getting convinced that he is the serial killer they are both looking for but they don't have any solid proofs. Things take a sinister turn when the two partners want to arrest the suspect by any means necessary while the potential culprit willingly manipulates and provokes them.This movie convinces on numerous levels. First of all, the film oozes with sinister atmosphere from start to finish. This slow burn intensifies in its second half and leads to a stunning finale that will still haunt you long after the movie has ended. The three main characters are very intriguing and portrayed splendidly by talented veteran actors Denzel Washington, Rami Maled and Jared Leto. The dialogues have depth and the scriptwriting is quite profound. This movie would also work very well as a novel. The gloomy settings bring the early nineties to life in an authentic way. The camera work is calm and precise like most crime dramas from that era. The light and sound effects are employed with care and especially the night shots and crime scenes are haunting.In the end, The Little Things if one of the greatest neo-noir movies in recent memory. This movie finds the perfect balance between profound dramatic parts and gloomy thriller elements. This film has been crafted very professionally. Especially the three charismatic lead actors stand out and make a very good movie excellent. Anyone who appreciates dark crime movies should give The Little Things a shot.",The Little Things
44,masonfisk,THE WAGES OF SIN...!,7,9 February 2021,"The recent thriller w/a trifecta of Oscar winning actors; Denzel Washington, Rami Malek & Jared Leto. Washington was a big LA detective but after a deadly mishap during a multiple murder investigation he was cached to a Northern California town to eke out his days as a deputy. In a chance coincidence, he returns back to his stomping grounds (on an errand to pick up a piece of evidence for an unrelated case) where he's gets a full view of a press conference being run by Malek, in the spot he once held, detailing a new killing (w/similar circumstances to his own unsolved). At first derisive to the way his older partners show deference to Washington, Malek brings him in to consult w/Washington none to happy to go back to dot his 'I's & cross his 'T's as it were. Leto becomes the focus of the investigation (the murder victim had an appointment for a fridge repairman which Leto being one in the area) since the clues start to point towards him hard. Leto however seems to be straddling the fence as to whether he's the doer or just a guy who likes to mess w/the police which puts an ever increasing tightening vice on capturing the killer (a missing woman adds to the pressure). According to something I saw on the Double Toasted video review for this movie (one person in the chat room said the script was written in the late 90's) this film feels retro (films like this aren't really made anymore) which makes sense since the movie Seven (released in 1995) was the pinnacle of this type of thriller, you'd figure every studio beat the bushes to find their own version of the same success. Falling into the dark European thrillers which have become the rage in the last few years (The Girl w/the Dragon Tattoo trilogy & the misbegotten The Snowman is another), this film works in the low key register it finds itself w/an ambiguous ending which doesn't tie everything into a neat bow. Kudos to writer/director John Lee Hancock (who wrote A Perfect World for Clint Eastwood back in '93) who knows he's mining for small nuggets of goodness rather than a mother lode. Co-starring Chris Bauer (from The Wire), Natalie Morales, Terry Kinney (who worked w/Washington in The Devil in a Blue Dress) all as fellow detectives w/Glenn Morshower as Washington's boss & Frederick Koehler (who I remember as the son on Kate & Allie) as an initial suspect for the crimes.",The Little Things
45,questl-18592,Big Problems,2,8 June 2021,"As the credits roll on this one I have three distinct thoughts in my head.1. This movie really wants to be Se7en but lacks the skill to actually get there. All the way up to the penultimate scene, this feels like it's going for the Fincher vibe of a dark, morose city teeming with scum and villainy. We get the young hotshot cop teaming up with the brilliant veteran officer to hunt down the serial killer that is brutalizing victims in a seemingly uncatchable way. Even Leto's performance feels lake a pale shadow of Spacey's John Doe as he struts onto scene in his quirky absurdity and demands to be considered the brilliant villain.2. This film justifies certain actions on behalf of law enforcement that I think is utterly reprehensible. Insomuch as rewarding and tricking certain characters into thinking the horrible things they did weren't that bad so they can continue on. No. No no no. Especially in 2021 you do not get to make that movie. It's irresponsible.3. Is Oscar Winner Rami Malek a good actor? He won the award for his portrayal of Mr. Mercury in Bohemian, and yeah I like that movie but I didn't think it was an Oscar performance and I certainly don't think anyone's going to remember it in the long run. He won us all over with Mr. Robot, which was great but that could've just been the perfect role for him. I'm not even implying there's an answer to this question because the simple truth might be that it's too early on to tell but I've gotta say, personally I think he's running dangerously close to being ""that guy that was really good in that one show.""Those points aside, I think this is an awful movie. It's weirdly one of the rare movies where the editing felt like a massive problem the whole way through. The soundtrack is overblown, they jump from shot to shot in haphazard fashion, characters talk like they're racing to see who can get through their lines first. Oh, and that little moral hiccup as well. We've got Washington, Malek and Leto all running the show here and there's just nothing worth the price of admission. This is a hard pass for me, I don't think it's worth anyone's money and I don't think it's worth anyone's time. Go watch Se7en, it's what The Little Things (which they say about 20 times)!!!SPOILER!!!So, my biggest issue really comes at the end. Malek is so obsessed with the idea that Leto is the killer because Leto is trying as hard as possible to look like the killer. They go out to what looks like the discount version of the powerline fields from Se7en and Malek kills Leto. Washington shows up, sees what's going on and decides to help Malek. So, he goes and breaks into Leto's house and finds out UH OH! Looks like Leto was innocent. Oh well, Malek's a good guy right? He's got a wife and kids so let's help him out! So Washington helps dispose of the evidence, including Leto's body and then skips town. Malek is losing it because he totally killed a guy for no good reason but don't worry, Denzel falsifies evidence so that Malek can feel justified and go on about his life with zero consequences because WHY SHOULD THERE BE CONSEQUENCES FOR MURDER!? Oh my god it's infuriating.",The Little Things
46,aidanratesmovies,"A Great Film, weighed down by 'talent' behind the screen",7,30 January 2021,"Murder mystery, cop drama, you name it, The Little Things has it all- unfortunately it just can't keep itself together very well. Denzel Washington, Rami Malek, and Jared Leto star in this thriller about a hunt for a mysterious serial killer, and if that's not enough to grab you, than I don't know what is. However, while executing this plot, the film certainly has its struggles. To start off with the films flaws, much of the set up feels rather forced and generic- a cop cliched story you feel like you have heard a million times by now. The pacing also feels a bit rushed once things start moving, and it seems hard to keep up and keep track of all the information, with so little reason to care. The ending is also a dissapointment. I won't spoil anything, and I get what it was trying to do, but an unsatisfying conclusion to a somewhat messy story certainly doesn't feel like the ending this film deserved. Denzel and Malek are fine in their leading roles, nothing special really about them all in all, but they are certainly not bad either. Jared Leto shines whenever he gets to take control of the scene, although it can have its drawbacks story wise. There are many excellent and very dark little moments throughout this film, I feel somewhere there was a masterpiece in here, but half of it was too muttled to be so. The cinematography is absolutely beautiful, and the music is a nice touch. The film can be rather entertaining, which is why it rubbed off on me probably better than I felt it should have, but it's certainly an enjoyable mystery to follow, just not one to solve necessarily. In the end, The Little Things is a mixed bag that had so much more potential for it. But due to subpar writing and directing, it's only something kinda average.My Rating: 7/10.",The Little Things
47,valleyjohn,Really good,8,20 May 2021,"This is a really good thriller. The biggest compliment I can give it is that it has a massive David Fincher feel about it and I'm not sure there is a better director of psychological Thrillers than that man .Kern County Deputy Sheriff Joe Deacon is sent to Los Angeles for what should have been a quick evidence-gathering assignment. Instead, he becomes embroiled in the search for a serial killer who is terrorizing the city.This movie is a three way play off between a trio of very good actors , all on top of their game . Denzel Washington is looking old now and out of shape and that's perfect for this role of a cop who's seen it and done it all .Rami Malik is great as the cop who replaced Deacon and despite having new ideas , wants to rely on Deacon for advice.Thirdly and in my opinion the best performance is Jared Leto . He is brilliantly creepy as the loner who may or may not have killed all those girls .This is not only a film about a serial killer , it's about workplace stress and PTSD .Some might say it's a slow burner but I like that about it . It's creepy , it has some nice twists and even after the film is finished it has you asking questions - In a good way .Recommended.",The Little Things
48,masonsaul,Great crime thriller,8,20 February 2021,"Whilst the plot is nothing knew, The Little Things is still a great crime thriller that's slow yet engrossing and it's deliberately unsatisfying ending really worked for me. Denzel Washington gives an incredible lead performance and has solid chemistry with Rami Malek, who is great. Jared Leto is also incredible and extremely unnerving throughout. John Lee Hancock's direction is really good, it's well filmed and well paced. The music by Thomas Newman is also really good.",The Little Things
49,jadepietro,Little to Enjoy,5,31 January 2021,"IN BRIEF: A standard cop procedural drama that has some good moments amid lots of clunky dialog and far-fetched plotting.JIM'S REVIEW: (MILDLY RECOMMENDED) Perhaps, the less I say about John Hancock's predictable but diverting potboiler, The Little Things, the better. It's a standard crime thriller that settles into familiar territory as two detectives investigate a serial killer. Been there done that! Believe me, the growing number of reasons not to produce this tired formula of a movie certainly outweighs the rationale by its producers to green-light this misfire.Joe ""Deke"" Deacon (Denzel Washington), a former LA cop and now county sheriff, is still on the trail of some unsolved murders which leads him back to his old haunt andinto view of his new replacement, cocky up-and coming detective, Jimmy Baxter (Rami Malek) Deke's old cases have similar MO's with some of Jimmy's new cases. Hence, a new teaming and both join together to track down a seedy suspect, Albert Sparma (Jered Leto).The acting is the film's main draw. Mr. Washington is an accomplished pro and he walks through this role with ease. He has had major practice with this outsider role in other film performances (The Equalizer, The Bone Collector, his Oscar-winning Training Day, Devil in a Blue Dress, Ricochet) and though he brings a touch of class to this film, he's still slumming in this convoluted tale. One can't blame Mr. Malek for wanting to act with this legendary star, but his role is so cliché-ridden and underdeveloped and he adds little to this dim-witted role. Mr. Leto, always good with menace, brings his fine acting skills to this procedural drama. The trio's sole scene together is the film's highlight.Mr. Hancock directs well, although the pacing of his film could be stepped up a bit. But his script tries to throw in so many twists and turns to invigorate his story which only confuse the motives of the characters and the plot structure. These innovative detours only make the moviegoer questions all of these odd behavior choices amid many LOL (Leaps of Logic) in its storytelling. Once all is revealed, there is no feeling of awe, just an overwhelming sense of meh!I guess having Mr. Washington front-and-center may be enough justification for this film's existence. Midway in the movie, his character warns to his younger team partner, ""It's the little things that are important. It's the little things that get you caught."" I just didn't think Mr. Washington's spot-on warning was directly aimed at his moviegoing audience too. Yes, The Little Things do matter when creating movies, but Mr. Hancock and company were all caught up in the minutiae and completely missed the big picture. The end result is dull and uninspiring.

REVIEW:The new age means new approaches to the cinema world and this movie took that liberty to stray from the usual action packed, crime buster that USA has made famous. The Little Things is all about portraying the criminal investigation process, the stress that goes with it, and the effects it has on certain people in their responses to hunting down the perpetrator. Those who like the realism in their cinema coffee blend are going to appreciate the lack of flashy sequences and gun play, favoring the gradual revelation of clues and the grey area that solving crimes sometimes takes to get the man, including invasion of freedoms. Amidst the crime comes a fantastic portrayal of two detectives' approaches to the case, mixing histories, honor, personalities and many other quirks that further muddy the waters of justice and personal revenge. Washington and Malek each have different backgrounds and you can potentially resonate with either one as they try to control their darker qualities and prevent it from going too far in their hunt. This different beast again adds an unseen antagonist in the mix and helps with part of the mystery element this film dangles in front of you in the trailers. A setting that helps further bring the crime thriller out further, dark filters, shady lighting, seedy parts of the neighborhoods, and a wilderness capable of hiding anything, the directors of setting get props from me in how they have created a very deadly, yet normal setting to amp the mystery.
The film continues to impress me in how much they have integrated the departments to finding the solution to the cases presented to them. Forensics, body dissection, district attorneys, potential witnesses, interrogation, and more are all a part of the pieces to help you dive further into the process, while also opening up more avenues of backstory to help shed some light on our protagonists. What's even cooler is seeing how these elements change as the big change in direction of the film occurs, going from trying to track down suspects to then trying to prove their suspect is the one who did the crime. Seeing how each of the departments changes their focus and brings new angles to try to change things up. While this may not seem too original, the movie gets points for breaking away from the USA crime movie syndrome, and really starts to show the more original flavor as the movie gets to the ending. At this point, the movie takes a final direction that will impress some and tick off others as what seems like a linear approaches suddenly twists and turns until the very last second.
Everything that brings it together though is the acting... no surprise right? Denzel ever the ""charismatic"" actor brings his cool edge to this thriller and the complexity the movie takes. Though still a bit one dimensional as many of his roles have become, the quiet, focused, and obsessive cop attitude still works extremely well to make the sword to cut through the darkness. His stoic and rash behaviors mix to get the case moving, and the usual loose cannon attitude means interesting dynamics with the rest of the cast on this case and the potential for an alluring backstory. Malek is of course a bag of tricks himself, a multi layered characters that starts out so one color, but quickly bleeds into others as his own inner flaws begin to leak out and manipulated. The two together are a solid pair with the writing, playing off of each other's personalities and helping bring the intensity of the case to full bear. As for Leto... well he pulls that Joker like insanity out, but manages to tweak it to levels that again stay realistic and less comical. His tone, smile, even the subtle movements are all delivered to the right mixture to give you the creeps, and still keep you guessing in the long run.Yet with the pages of good I have written, there are some limitations I have noticed others point out. For one thing, the victim edge is sort of diluted in this film, originally brought out as the heart of the tale, and then sort of brushed to the side. Serial killer films require that edge of who is the next one to be taken out by the deranged fool. Sadly, the little things spent little time on keeping that edge, and taking the victim part of the crime out meaning I missed that element. Minor in the long run, the danger sort of transpired to a new, more symbolic means and it really started to feel less impactful as the final act came around. Something that stayed through much of the film was an odd scene jump and transition at times especially at the beginning when the story was trying to find its stride. Random jumps between leads, going to random shots of the house, or a random lead to dig up a case, and constantly shifting to random areas of the case were a bit hard to follow and enjoy when they interrupted the momentum of the scene. Though more realistic, that interruption happened too frequently and felt that the time could have been better spent on some of the other limitations for me, such as characters and back story. Primarily for Denzel's character, his story offers a lot of complex pieces and information that although has fair representation could have been seen more in the struggles he had with the case. One backstory did this quite well and building upon the mystery, but others like his love life and health, could have taken a bit more time to develop. Even more so the use of other characters needed some more tweaking for me as well. The female cop with an edge, the one girl they spent 10 minutes introducing at the beginning, the detective and the forensic scientist... all had enough hints dropped to have deeper involvement, but sort of tapered out as the final act happened. I'm all about trying to make sure to select characters and use them well, and though not the worst I've seen, again there was so much they could have done to help fluff up their roles a little more.
The biggest things for me that I was not the biggest fan of were the lack of mystery at certain points and the ending. First off, the movie's first act is supposed to be about finding the potential killer and starts of keeping the identity a secret. That's great... except for the fact that the trailer kind of ruins it and thus takes that element away, which again is part of the magic of these films and a limitation to the Internet these days. Missing that component, the first act fortunately has other factors to keep you going, but that edge is a little more blunted as the result. Yet it's the ending that really pulls the rug out from under my feet, primarily the last twenty minutes or so. I'm all about making sure to close the loops and have a solid conclusion with only enough unknown to go back and talk about, but this film decided to leave more unknown and go the symbolic growth route instead. While powerful, the whole buildup of the second act was about determining the truth, which after many scenes and each party trying to outdo the other to find the truth I won't lie I was disappointed. Maybe it would not have met expectations, maybe the director was going for originality/realism a little more, or maybe it's the modern symbolic conclusion and let the audience decide. Regardless, the ending is there to let you discuss, but after all the disruptions that it brought, I was not a fan of the finale.The VERDICT:A great film in comparison to the last two hbomax originals, The Little Things really feels like a trip back to the theaters for me. A great acting cast brings out engaging characters who play the parts quite well in this game of crime. The complex characters with multiple layers that show off the complicated job of solving mysteries and bringing justice. With some camera angle supports, a realistic flavor, and some originality into the mix, this movie manages to stand out amidst several of the crime films I've seen recently. However, that very twist and approach to realism may have been the undoing at parts too, and with a semi-ambiguous ending that fulfills on some levels and fails on others, it's going to leave some scratching their head at if they enjoyed it. Still, limitations aside, this would be a movie worth watching for me and encourage you to give it a shot if you have the subscription for it.My scores are:Crime/Drama/Thriller: 7.5
Movie Overall: 6.5",The Little Things
51,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of The Little Things,7,30 January 2021,"""How's the trunk space?"" Creepy and hinting. The real question is how's 2021's The Little Things. I'd say it would take multiple viewings to give you my final answer. I do have an initial review though with some bells and whistles attached.Anyway ""Little Things"" was released in theaters and on HBO Max. Taking place in the 90s (it could've easily been the 80s as well), this film is noir to a certainty level. There are nighttime scenes with soft lighting, characters with Philip Marlowe stares, and shards of an enigma. The Little Things may be initially pretentious but it sure seems oddly fascinating in the long run.Starring three Oscar winners in Jared Leto, Denzel Washington, and Rami Malek, The Little Things is a borderline head-scratch-er that's almost too Hitchcockian for its own good. As far as persona appearances go, Washington looks a little comatose-d, Malek gives off a lucid vibe, and Leto channels his inner, 1970s Roger Daltrey with a beard.""Little Things"" is a David Fincher clone with residue from Law & Order and an episode of Twin Peaks. Added to that, it's Seven with lessened aftermath, 2007's Zodiac with similarly framed location shots, and Mulholland Drive without the glamour. Some critics have noted that ""Little Things"" is dated and well, it probably is. Whatever. You'll still think about it hours after the credits have gone up.The Little Things is yet another crime drama about police officers trying to catch an allusive, LA serial killer. Darned if director John Lee Hancock doesn't try to avoid making things stock, assembly-lined, and ordinary. He films stuff low to ground with equaling close-ups, wide angles, and overheads. Hancock is also obsessed with using gleaming light that is either flashlight-ed, clean, or in the distance. His style is erect as his ""Little Things"" does a lot of well, ""little things"". Rating: 3 stars.",The Little Things
52,Kingslaay,Felt unfinished,7,11 March 2021,"Denzel Washington, Rami Malek and Jared Leto are standouts in this film. A powerful cast and an interesting setting. The film is interesting enough and has the bones of a great thriller. We are taken on a journey to find the truth but at the very last turn it comes to sharp stop. It turns out it was more about letting go and the journey instead so it was a different kind of film. This angle could have been given more weight rather than the hunt for truth. Hence it felt unfinished and not the best use of such immense talent.",The Little Things
53,elliotjeory,I liked it because it's different,8,18 February 2021,"It's a slow burning film, great acting, Jared Leto looked really creepy, Focuses on the drama rather than the flash which I prefer. People always complain about the same old movie formula and when something comes along different they complain about that too! It is a decent film, no cliches, good to see Malek in a big film role and Washington is always great to watch.",The Little Things
54,arungeorge13,A generic crime thriller that feels a bit dated but holds up owing to its leads! [+53%],5,31 January 2021,"With a cast this good (Washington, Malek, and Leto), you expect a film like The Little Things to kick into high-gear sooner and offer some extra punches along the way. But alas, the John Lee Hancock directorial is as generic a serial-killer-procedural as it can get. The obvious comparisons to Se7en aside, The Little Things makes scant use of its talented leads, only generating momentary thrills and highs. A lot of the proceedings extrapolate to been-there-seen-that, and knowing that the script had been written (by Hancock) in 1993 (but underwent production in 2019) only adds to the dated feel of the flick. While it's good to perceive The Little Things as ""set in the 90s"", the script could have benefited from some updation.Jared Leto lends an intimidating vibe to his character (of a serial-killer-suspect), while Denzel is quintessentially Denzel (though slightly more restrained than usual) and Malek ably fits into his earnest cop role. As contradicting as it may sound, it's exactly the little things in an investigation thriller (such as the clues leading to the suspect or suspects, dots that connect without being expository, and a layer of mystery which keeps the audiences guessing until the end) that fail to work here. If not for these men, the film would have been flat-out forgettable. As expected of a film set in the 90s, the women have little to do but play hapless victims or assisting the men in their tasks.It's a throwback film alright; one that revels in its polaroid snaps, payphones, and neon signboards. The Little Things focuses less on the whodunnit bits, toying more around the morality of the cops to ultimately nail the culprit. The late twist, in fact, feels less like a twist and more like a step in rounding off a certain character arc. It remains thoroughly watchable, but The Little Things offers so little in the shocks & surprises department that you'll end up not positioning it anywhere close to a Se7en or a Zodiac.",The Little Things
55,martimusross,A Quirky Movie About Obsessed Cops!,6,17 April 2021,"The Little ThingsWell this was an interesting spin on the serial killer theme. The film spent the first hour showing two like minded cops using their deductive skills to hunt down what they presumed to be a serial killer.However slowing but surely it became an examination of how murder detectives cope with unsolved cases. The film asserted that becoming an ""angel"", the only person left alive to fight to get justice for a victim, was a rabbit hole where lay obsession, fixation and ultimately personal destruction.Joe Deacon played by Denziel Washington recognised in Jim Baxter played by Remi Malek the same fixation developing on the ""little things"", case details that may supply a breakthrough, and sought to help him and at the same time steer him away from the ""angel"" complex.At the outset to put these two meticulous actors together would appear to be a car crash, it wasn't, but the chemistry wasn't quite there either. Denziel overdid the mumbling with gum in his mouth and Remi over-worked it with some accents and facial expressions. But on reflection it was on the verge of convincing.I enjoyed it but many will feel shortchanged in did we or did we not catch the serial killer, however when the movie was not really about this it becomes irrelevant.I'm giving this a 6 outta 10 for inventiveness and I never miss Denziel as he is always a star.",The Little Things
56,wisewebwoman,Denzel is superb,6,11 August 2021,"But there is so many problems with the film that irritated. For one all the cutting hither and on was far too sharp and quite meaningless. The lighting was also quite poor and Malik mumbled far too much, so I switched on the subtitles.A good story however of how impossible police work can be and how it can corrupt in the hunt for truth and vengeance. It was obvious (to me) that Leto was not the killer as there were clues in his addiction to the police channel and his prior false confession. He was merely obsessed with the police and procedures.Malik going off alone with him was an eyebrow raiser and these two rogue cops on the loose broke every procedure in the manual.Another drawback were the endless car rides. Thirty minutes could have been lopped off the film and not been missed.6/10.",The Little Things
57,leftbanker-1,I Don't Get It,3,30 January 2021,"I swear, I didn't get it. I thought the movie was OK although very run-of-the-mill. It was also too long by about thirty minutes, a common malady in recent cinema. The interaction between the hotshot new detective and the old, semi-disgraced cop was interesting and surprised me. I was expecting the kid to be a jerk, but he was reverential at every step-something out of the ordinary, if not original.The opening sequence went on far too long, although I was relieved at the outcome. I'm glad they avoided the gore and violence of most films of this nature. All of the violence was portrayed in death, gruesome, but not in itself violent. The bad guy was just too flippant, too breezy about his status, whatever that was. Even a completely innocent guy wouldn't be so nonchalant and cool in a hard-core police interrogation.The ending was just a wild attempt to make the film something other than it is: a police procedural with not much to set it apart from dozens and dozens of movies in this genre. That, and I really just didn't get it.",The Little Things

Some random events without exact cause or intention. No crime, no evidence, no purpose, no lesson, no good feelings. Nothing to look forward for. I looked forward to reveal of crimes and suspects, but already since half of movie lost any hope.

A nice little hook is set without the viewer knowing and then you are slowly reeled in and kept on the edge of your seat wondering where it is all going. In the ordinary parlance this is called entertainment. What's not to like? One word describes the movie well i.e. ""gripping"" and then it goes to ""ripping"" as it yanks the viewers insides out. Nicely done and executed by all involved. Something to keep in mind when you are trying to make sense of it all while viewing is this: Police work is challenging. Criminal activity while interesting or maybe even fascinating gets to you after a while and the Universal Law kicks in. Whatever you get into gets into you and we see that law applied and played-out here. Cops become a little like their work and criminals become a little like cops and the fine line blurs. At what point does justice make sense or the pursuit of solving a crime long past? Does a detective do this job for jobs sake or does it become an obsession to some law officers?

66,bankofmarquis,3 strong actors elevate this above mediocrity,7,1 February 2021,"Generally, when a movie is ""dumped"" in January, it is a sure sign of a bad film, filled with Liam Neeson kicking butt or CGI monsters attacking a small group of survivors in an isolated location, but these being times that they are, Warner Brothers release of THE LITTLE THINGS simultaneously in Movie Theaters and on HBO MAX gave me reason to change my thinking.And...I'm glad I did for THE LITTLE THINGS is an intriguing mystery with 3 very strong actors going toe-to-toe with each other.Written and Directed by John Lee Hancock (THE BLIND SIDE), THE LITTLE THINGS stars the great Denzel Washington as a former L.A. Detective (now a Sherriff in some small town) who returns to L.A. and teams up with his hot shot replacement (Rami Malek) to track down a serial killer (the main suspect being Jared Leto).It is a moody, atmospheric piece with Hancock taking his time telling the story he wants to tell in the way he wants to tell it, letting this trio of Oscar winning actors take over the story while he creates interesting, moody pictures/scenarios/scenes.And...this approach mostly works. 2 time Oscar winner Denzel Washington, as you can imagine, is terrific as Joe ""Deke"" Deacon a cracker-jack Detective that is living with some demons from his last case in L.A.. He is in 90% of the scenes in this film and he is more than capable of carrying this film through some pretty slow and sloggy scenes.I would love to say that Oscar winner Rami Malek is equal to the task of playing against Washington and keeping the middle part of this film interesting - but he just isn't. Not to say that Malek is bad - he is very good. He just isn't as good as Washington and the chemistry between these two characters was just not all that strong.That said...without spoiling anything...Malek has a scene at the end of this film where he is TERRIFIC and shows that he is a VERY, VERY good actor.The wild card in this film is Oscar winner Jared Leto as the prime suspect in this case - and he is more than up to the task. As is often the case in these sorts of film (think David Fincher's SEVEN), Leto does not show up in full force until about 2/3 of the way through the film and that is too bad for he creates sparks on the screen the moment he enters the proceedings and the 3 way interrogation scene between these 3 Oscar winners is, I'm sure, what drew all 3 of these performers to this project and is the best thing in the film.The praise and the criticism of this film must fall on Writer/Director Hancock, for he was smart enough to cast these 3 actors and direct them well while also falling prey to falling in love too much with the script and atmosphere he created to the detriment of the film. He could have used someone telling him to speed things up.Letter Grade: B7 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank (ofMarquis)",The Little Things

69,Horror_Flick_Fanatic,Cat and Mouse,6,4 February 2021,Three academy award winners in a film really drew me in. But the story wasn't that good. It turned into a cat and mouse game between Leto's character and that of Malek and Denzel. The screenplay came up short in my opinion. I think the writer gave more attention to Malek and Denzel's backstory than the main crime thriller. They killed off Leto's character too soon because the cat and mouse chase left more to be desired.,The Little Things

72,mikayakatnt,Not the best film I've seen this year,2,10 February 2021,"If this movie came out in the 90s or early 2000s, it would have been good. But, the tropes have been so overplayed by now that it's become cliche.Surprise: a vague plot with an ambiguous ending. A slow burner that pays homage to 90s films of the same genre. A modern dark noir that uses its silence as much as words.But, I was expecting more with this trifecta of a cast. Denzel Washington kind of does his ""I'm too old for this"" act. Rami Malek plays a top-of-the-class detective that doesn't seem to fully do his work. And Jared Leto plays an ambivalent repairman with a peculiar stride.For all the work done everywhere else, the screenplay could have been modernized for 2021's audience. It's not the fault of the original writer who wrote the script in 1997 but the people who took it and ran with it. The executives failed to see that the 1997 script needed to be made palpable to the modern audience.1/5.

73,kuarinofu,"70% Se7en, 30% something different",6,30 January 2021,"The title of the film reflects the essence of it pretty well.There were in fact good little things here and there, a couple of different takes, more realistic, and less cinematic approaches. The film was probably based on or inspired by real detective work, I assume.What it lacked though was the dynamic between the characters. Where Se7en was able to establish a connection with one simple 'vibrating home' joke, here we don't really see that throughout the entire film. Both Malek and Washington were outstanding; the ties are just not there.Also, Leto's whole performance did not capture my attention at all. He wasn't interesting, menacing, or sinister. He wasn't a believer, a violent sadist, or a downright violent psychopath. His whole set-ups were for nothing, all the 'little things' and details were also not addressed. Hell, I'm still waiting for that witness subplot to be resolved but the film is over. I don't understand what was the point of all these details. Also, the ending was very bitter-sweet, while I enjoyed doing something else yet familiar (again, Se7en), the way it was handled felt very forced and the believability of the writing was just gone.They did borrow a lot of the little things from other films, mostly as an inspiration rather than a direct copy, and I appreciate this. Besides Se7en there were some elements from True Detective S1 (with the girls, the style of the murders) and some more.I understand that they wanted this film to be drier and less dramatic, but why is it so long and why does it try to introduce personal connections if there is nothing to back this up. There is no deep dive into anything. They have many interesting starts but they never lift off.As a complete story, the film felt ok, but I saw much more potential in it. Maybe if they would drop all the things they weren't planning to address and focus on doing the same story in a different way this could've been much better.I still can't recommend this since it lacks depth and packs quite a runtime, but if you're open-minded you can give it a try, it might interest you in some things, but it will leave you wanting more of those little things it cannot give you.",The Little Things
74,tm-sheehan,"Too many ""Little Things "" unanswered ?",6,23 February 2021,"My Review- ""The Little Things ""My Rating 6/10There were too many ""Little Things ."" that didn't add up to much for me in this Crime/Drama/ Thriller ? movie that many compare to the far superior 1995 Thriller Se7en.
The best performance by far for me in ""The Little Things."" was Jared Leto in the supporting role of Albert Sparma a chief suspect in a series of brutal murders involving young women he deserves his Golden Globe nomination .
Denzel Washington as Joe ""Deke"" Deacon a burnt -out Californian Deputy Sheriff haunted by his past unsolved cased is very impressive in this role . He teams up with Jim Baxter a crack LASD Detective played by Rami Malek who is ok in his role .
Baxter seems to have received his promotion more because he's joined his bosses Evangelical Church than any great talents as a Crime solver ?
I know Rami Malek is an impressive Actor and Academy Award winner for his dream role as Freddie Mercury in Bohemian Rhapsody but I'm yet to be convinced that he's a great actor .
He seemed to me to be channeling Marlon Brando in this film and mumbles many of his lines. He hasn't really done much at all since 2018 a voice for Chee Chee in the disappointing Doolittle and Mr Robot a television series that he starred in from 2015.
His next role as the villain Safin in the next James Bond saga ""No Time to Die interests me as I thought he'd probably make a very creepy villain in ""The Little Things."" he has a very unusual look and personality that probably suits character roles better than starring roles.
It may be the way this Detective character role is written but he doesn't really seem to do much Detective ING , that's all left up to Denzel Washington his partner who is actually on leave and shouldn't really be Detective ING at all.
I think this film is another case of the mistake of having the writer John Lee Hancock direct his own movie when more care should have been put into the script.
I read that Writer/Director John Lee Hancock originally wrote the screenplay for the film almost 30 years ago (1993) after completing his work on the Clint Eastwood picture "" A Perfect World.""
Steven Spielberg, Clint Eastwood, and Danny De Vito were all originally attached to direct this at separate points.
I think a great Director like Spielberg or Eastwood would have insisted on some major changes as the plot at times which is unbelievable eg - A major murder spree of this magnitude would have a huge investigation team involved rather than a burnt out obviously disturbed Deputy Sheriff and a Senior Detective who just doesn't seem to have any ideas at all ?
In my opinion the Screenplay let's the film down no spoilers of course except to say the audience is left to make up its own mind and I think there are too many ""Little Things"" left unexplained by John Lee Hancock in his writing and directing.
The budget for this movie which opened to great Box Office was $30 million
but World Wide ticket sales are not impressive just $20.2 million.
I've seen far better Thriller Crime Television Dramas than this film and yes it is The Little Things that count and there's too many unanswered questions it seems strange when the most interesting character in a movie is the villain?",The Little Things

Two cops look for a killer and become obsessed with following him and he may or may not have done it - but honestly it's hard to care either way. The cop with the funny eyes looks like a snapchat filter and the supposed serial killer looks like he smoked crack. Neither one can act. Script isn't good. Not suspenseful. The end is very bad.,The Little Things
81,Alexander_Blanchett,Would have made a great True Detective Season 4,7,31 January 2021,"I liked it. it was a nicely old fashioned detective story. Actually it had the touch of ""True Detective"" and would probably have made a great Season 4. It contains many elements of the famous TV show and I think giving us more time to look at the characters, to emphasize more on several plot elements would have done good to the story because thats where it mostly lacks a little bit.
The acting is superb. Now you've got 3 Oscar winning actors in the main roles, the expectations are high but I think absolutely flufilled.
Denzel Washington is fantastic in the leading role, its a typical Washington role but again he adds something really special to it. Especially in the scenes when he is facing is past. Great work.
Rami Malek got a lot of criticism for his performance, being too wooden, lacking emotionality, etc. I think thats exactly what his character is all about and that he absolutely captured it perfectly. I go even so far and say he gave the best performance in the film. His attitiude was unconventional but so was his character. Jared Leto was absolutely psycho and creepy. He did that well but needs to be careful to to get typecast in that kind of roles. But yeah he was really great.
The biggest issue lie in editing and direction in general . While the screenplay surely hd potential (also by John Lee Hancock) I think his direction really lacked. The score by Thomas Newman was good and so was the cinematography, actually one of the best elements. I was not a fan of the ending, I appreciate the conclusion of what the film tries to tell but still was a bit lazy at the end. Otherwise, good atmospheric crime thriller.",The Little Things

As I've said so many times in my 2020 reviews, you have to be TOP Notch to pull off being writer/director/producer (or actor) otherwise you produce something for Walmart's $1.99 bin. ""The Little Things"" is a drawn out tale of bad police work that degenerates into multiple coverups of accidental police killings, and how those police cope with their mistakes.

He brought nothing to this and in fact really weakened the film. Leto and Denzel were great - my stars are for them. Den is looking haggard though. Oof!So unbelievable that a cop would turn his back on a suspect - his gun was practically begging to be grabbed by Leto the way it was waving around like a flag. And we are expected to believe that he was able to dig all those graves without having tore up bleeding hands? Or passing out due to no water while exerting all that energy all night? Preposterous!Also why was that girl at the crime scene? Hard to believe DW would just fire randomly before laying eyes on whomever it was first.Finally who was the killer?

The performances were as expected - Denzel was Denzel, Rami Malek was Freddie Mercury .... errr, I mean Rami Malek, and all the supporting actors did an effective job. BUT ... what a performance by Jared Leto! This was his hour, to be sure.When a Deputy, Joe Deacon (Denzel Washington), is sent to his old stomping grounds to collect evidence for a case, he is inadvertently pulled into another murder while there. The modus operandi matches an unsolved case from his past and he decides to stay and help investigate. He revisits old acquaintances (some friendly, some not), opening old wounds along the way as he tries to get closure on that chapter of his life. Their investigative trail leads them to a likely suspect (played by Jared Leto) which will affect them in more ways than one.This was an intriguing film with fine performances, especially by Jared Leto, who was nothing short of mesmerizing in my humble opinion. The plot was thick and well wrought, the pacing spot on, and the cinematography was very good. I was captured from the start, and my attention was held until the final play. The ending wasn't what I was expecting, yet, it was satisfactory and did the overall story justice.I would recommend this film. It was better than I thought it would be, however, I felt it could have been punched up a bit more to be a bit more exciting.

89,trinaboice,Should have been better with 3 Oscar winners,7,4 February 2021,"IN A NUTSHELL:
This dramatic crime thriller was written and directed by John Lee Hancock and stars Academy Award winners Denzel Washington, Rami Malek, and Jared Leto. Wow, what a powerhouse cast. I adore all of those actors. Warner Brothers has been pushing for awards for this film and, while the cast features 3 Oscar winners, the script and direction fail the talented actors. The result is a detective movie that is more underwhelming than it should have been.THINGS I LIKED:
I adore Denzel Washington. Who doesn't? He actually earned over $20 million upfront for this film!
Jared Leto is a versatile performer in movies, as well as the lead vocalist in his band ""Thirty Seconds to Mars."" His character was the most entertaining one by far. Creepy and funny. Once he appears on the screen, you finally get that fun cat-and-mouse feeling you want in a crime drama. What was up with the fake nose though?
I adore Rami Malek, but it was hard to connect with his character. His performance was great, but the script didn't allow the audience to really understand him.
Nice musical soundtrack, as well as the musical score by Thomas Newman.
There's a twist. I love twists! While watching, you know there is more than meets the eye in this detective movie, which causes you to keep watching.
It's more of a character study than a movie that really cares about the plot. It provides more psychological tension than mystery.
Intriguing opening scene.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
Writer/director John Lee Hancock wrote this screenplay almost 30 years ago! While I love many of his other movies, this film actually needed more work.
Despite the many murders, the movie is a slow burn. Of course, the slowness of it is part of the point. Detective work mostly consists of waiting and driving and wondering and thinking.
The storyline is a bit confusing and messy.
Each scene seems to bring more questions. Quite a few of them don't ever get answered.
Some viewers say the ending is ""unsatisfying."" I'd love to hear what YOU think! Comment below!
Act 1 gets you going. Act 2 is a bore. Act 3 is a disaster. The ending is ambiguous, not in a clever way, but in a poorly-written way.
The movie is long and felt like it. Some scenes could have easily been shaved off.
As a detective movie, it doesn't offer enough thrills or twists to stand up next to other films that did it so much better, like Seven (1995).
The time period of this movie was super vague.TIPS FOR PARENTS:

90,ridi-arahan,It's the little things that matter,7,29 January 2021,"What worked:
Denzel Washington worked a bit time in the movie, maybe one of the few things that good about the movie. The movie had its mood set right, climate felt and the actors, all the lead, were very good on their respective roles. I would have liked to see more scenes of Jared.
What did not work:
Viewers would have liked the movie at least more if the ending and finale scenes paid right tribute. The major issue with the movie is the screenplay, it does it flow and does not stay intact to keep the movie viewing experience a pleasant one. Having such fine actors in the lead was a big bonus, it's a missed opportunity that they were not casted right or were not given enough space. It's not a bad movie but considering the talent it's a failure. Rami's character get a bit off, maybe it was written like that but it felt distant and undesirable. Overall, not the kick we get from a nice thriller is missing. Last act felt totally flat considering the option they could have on their narrative

In fact, the score is one of the films greatest strengths and is an excellent track in its own right, something that I will be seeking out on Spotify.I gather that a fair number of reviewers didn't like the ending, and I have to wonder if some of them just didn't get it or were, again, expecting some sort of action ending.

99,sweidman-28016,A Big Letdown,5,9 February 2021,"""It's the little things that are important, Jimmy. It's the little things that get you caught.""Welcome to January Movies! Today we have...a thriller that thinks it's Se7en!I'd just like to stay this off by saying this whole exhausting watch I had ""The Little Things You Do Together"" from Company stuck in my head. In John Lee Hancock's The Little Things, Kern County Deputy Sheriff Joe Deacon is sent to Los Angeles for what should have been a quick evidence-gathering assignment. Instead, he becomes embroiled in the search for a serial killer who is terrorizing the city. The synopsis is much more interesting than it makes out to be. What we get instead is a two hour movie that thinks it's really thrilling but actually could've been done in a significant less amount of time. I may be over exaggerating this review because I don't think it's that bad. I'm just mad because Jared Leto has gotten two major nominations for his performance and because the choices made in the movie. To start with the good, it's entertaining enough to keep watching. The beginning feels a lot like Zodiac in style and aesthetic. And for about 30 minutes I was completely fine with it. The acting in here is also decent. It's nothing amazing, but the three actors do carry the movie. Since Jared Leto got those two nominations for supporting actor, it poses the question of who was better: Rami Malek or Jared Leto? They're both about the same in my opinion. The only difference is Malek doesn't look greasy and isn't a villain in the story. I like the look of the movie. There are my positives.The story is the issue here. It tries way too hard to be something great. By now, we've seen so many movies, shows, documentaries, and videos concerning serial killers. As an audience, we're way too smart for it. The whole time Denzel and Rami are literally making it harder than it needs to be. One scene has them searching Jared Leto's apartment, and oh my god, I could not believe how stupid the two were. It became a whole ordeal that could've been done in a couple minutes. That's the whole movie, though! The case could've been solved easier if they thought, but everything is leading up to the ending. I think Hancock had the beginning, a little bit of the middle, and the end planned out, but nothing else. Even the ending goes on for another 10 minutes when it could've just ended. In the mix, we have Denzel Washington concerned about the case because of a past experience that isn't fully revealed till the end. All that they cared about was the end when they should've focused on the story. I don't know what they were thinking, but they thought they were so smart. This is below average which disappoints me. I don't think it's terrible since I felt sort of entertained throughout. But since I wanted it to be good after those first 30 minutes, it feels like a big let down. It's a shame that this is a waste of good actors, a decent director, and a screenplay that could've been interesting.",The Little Things

It was supposed to take place in 1990, but they showed arcade games from the early 80s and most of the cars were early 80s late 70s.Nothing, and I mean absolutely nothing about the cops were real. Cops don't behave, talk or act like that. I could spend 3 hours writing all the problems in this film. If you want me to believe that a cop would get in a car with Albert Sparma without backup you gotta be crazy. Of course the main detective actually began digging by himself and of course with his back to Sparma . Does it get any more stupid than this?I have never seen a veteran cop act like this (Rami). He is literally spaced out through the whole movie starring into space. Bizarre.It was a borefest. I had to force myself to stay awake every minute. It was a bunch of ""ping pong"" dialogue. Back and forth back and forth. And all uninteresting.This was a WEAK version of se7en. I don't know why this film was made.

I have no idea what he was trying to do with his performance. Creepy, yes. Derivative of every other creepy suspect performance ever? Also, yes. I kept waiting for him to use the dialogue of suspects from ""Seven"", ""Silence of the Lambs"", ""Sling Blade"", or just let go and do his Joker thing.

107,TwistedContent,Subtlety Overkill / An Interesting Case,6,30 January 2021,"The morbid fascination of serial killers, fictional or not, is always alive, though I'm not here to look for any why's, but to tell you a story of what could've been, and what is... My favorite examples of similar movies are Fincher's ""Se7en"" & ""Zodiac"" and Bong Joon Ho's ""Memories of Murder"", and all three of these are from the perspective of those investigating. Other serial killer films, also excellent pieces, like ""Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer"" or ""10 Rillington Place"", are more horror-like, and rather from the perspective of the killer, and/or his victims. ""The Little Things"" features an absolute a-list, enjoyable cast, a highly intriguing plot, and... a dry execution. I love psychological thrillers, but there are various qualities. It feels like John Lee Hancock wished to thrive on subtlety, and overdid it. Spoilers ahead.""The Little Things"" sees Joe 'Deke' Deacon (Denzel Washington) hunting a free-roaming killer, together with his own personal demons and reasons which get revealed later, quite unsurprisingly. Deke joins forces with the young, talented, hardworking but naïve Jim Baxter (Rami Malek), who, throughout the plot, kind of lacks the third character dimension. Together they set on the slow path to finding Albert Sparma, a creepy looking and equally creepy sounding Jared Leto.The story moves at a slow pace, mulling over figuring out things that the viewer has already done so 20 minutes back, emphasizing subtlety and 'little things', which are the things that lead to finding a killer, or maybe the things that make You You... Details matter, that much we understand. Even with concluding and accepting that it is a character and performance driven film, even with understand the movie's point and message (talk about that later), ""The Little Things"", to me, still is a lackluster crime drama. Perhaps it could be the fact that this script has been around for 30 years before John Lee Hancock (""The Blind Side"", ""The Highwaymen"") decided to direct it himself. Dated idea that has a tough time to pass now. Some elements of the story ain't exactly screaming 'realistic' either, and for such a silently strong movie that truly wishes to ground itself in the bleakness of the world, feeling authentic is important. ""The Little Things"" simply lacks energy, urge. Instead it is uneven and frequently loses momentum.What ""The Little Things"" got going for it big time, is the acting. The three main characters consist of Oscar winners. I had been missing Denzel for some time, since ""The Equalizer 2"", I believe, and he is the jewel of this movie, but sadly such a great performance seems a little wasted when the rest of the movie doesn't quite hold up... I was also excited for Leto and Malek, one of whom once again proved to me he should finally have some slack cut for the Joker troubles, and the other received a not-rich-enough character.
In my opinion, a good serial killer movie, among other things, warrants heavy atmosphere, and some sharper jolts, and I don't necessarily mean graphic violence. While the slow pace and ultimate slight emptiness of ""The Little Things"" doesn't help the atmosphere keep its grimness and seriousness up, there are two killer jolts to be found, one of them intro-es the movie, just a simple, small cat-and-mouse game, and the other is the Sparma's final confrontation. However, grime and ponder can be found in the character of Deacon, whose guilt, frustration and sadness manifests itself frequently, and is also the eminent danger that stands in the way of Jim Baxter's character. And in the way of the viewer. I believe that John Lee Hancock not clarifying for us whether Sparma was the killer, puts us, the viewers, in a role 'similar' to those of our two cops, and leaves us dealing with not knowing, and frustration. Like it was for Deacon and, eventually, Jim. But Deacon gave Jim one thing, the red barrete, that can change the course of Jim's life, as it was Deke's wish for Jim not to become the mess he is himself. They sure left us messy. Yet, I am not sure what exactly this film says about guilt - should it be lived through, or should it be gotten rid of, and at what expense?On one hand, it is an atmospheric, subtle, slow-burn, philosophical, psychological crime drama - all of that sounds terrific, but I can't sell it to You like that, because underneath there (also) are spots of boredom, spots of unfocused dialogue, some unrealistic resolutions, some expectations that you wish weren't true were met, and some expectations that get shattered. My rating: 6/10.",The Little Things

The ""washed up old cop teams up with aggressive young detective"" plotline has been done to death, but it still makes for an interesting watch if the caliber of the actors is high. Fortunately, Denzel Washington and Rami Malek fit that bill well as academy award winning-actors, and while the source material isn't stellar, they both do a respectable job here. Speaking of academy award winners, Jared Leto once again dials up the creep factor as an appliance maintenance guy, so there's that.'Little' is dark, heavy and unsettling at times, and while not an uplifting film by any means, it also has some important takeaways and explores interesting themes including the role of fatherhood and confronting the past. It also serves its intended purpose as a thriller - there are enough twists and turns to make it into a wild ride around LA circa 1990.It won't be remembered as a career highlight for any of its top-billed cast, but 'The Little Things' is worth the time if this is one of your favorite genres.",The Little Things

112,fciocca,Uninspired detective story with a big cast.,5,16 October 2021,"Having big names in your movie does not make it good. In a detective story the writing is everything, here there is no effective build about the crime, no tension at all, I was not curious to stick around and discover who the culprit of these murders was. The director most probably wanted to make a slow burner, but unfortunately there are many boring and completely useless scenes. The film is just entertaining enough to get by, but never got my full and undivided attention. The ending is dull and uninspired.Denzel Washington portrayed Joe, a cop hunted by his past as a detective and he does a great job in showing his struggle. Jared Leto played Sparma, a psychotic guy that gives a hard time to cops during their investigation. He was good, but his performance definitely missed the WOW factor. Knowing what Leto could pull off in ""Dallas Buyer Club"" and ""Blade Runner 2049"", I was quite disappointed. Did not like Rami Malek at all in this one. His acting was lazy, reminding me too much about Elliot Anderson from ""Mr. Robot"".""The Little Things"" had potential and could have been an enjoyable watch, especially for the niche of people that are into crime and detective stories. The movie wanted to show that being fixated over a case, may cause some people issues on a very deep and personal level. This is of course processed in a different way by Joe and Jim, and eventually their plots will have some common grounds. It is a great idea on paper, but it was badly developed, and a missed opportunity for John Lee Hancock.",The Little Things

I really liked that the two leads liked each other instead of butting heads. The backstory came out very naturally.Enter Jared Leto. This is when the movie goes downhill. His acting is over the top as well as his writing. The creepy guy that talks like a preschooler is so over done. And loses its effect very quickly. Why would Remi get into the car with him? I almost got it but couldn't justify it. Then he kills him with one shovel hit? He wasn't even pushing him that hard.This felt like a character movie that didn't put enough into the characters to give what happened any relevance. It ends and you're left wondering what everything meant. Not that I need a movie to have a message or for everything to be resolved. But this didn't feel like it was about anything at all. I'm only left to guess at to what happened. In order for this to work you need the pieces so you can put them together. This didn't have that.Is it that cops are all bad? Being a cop makes you bad? Obsession is bad? If you are pushed by a person you don't like and you're holding a blunt object in your hand you could impulsively hit them? If you hear a weird noise in the woods on a fresh crime scene and hear a strange noise and think it's the killer you might accidentally shoot them? I don't know.Having Denzel get too obsessed with a case was enough. Accidentally killing someone wasn't needed. That's called friendly fire. It sucks but it happens. He wouldn't have even gotten in trouble for that.I feel like we didn't see the last 3rd of this movie. This story can go somewhere and it doesn't.",The Little Things
114,DeBBss,The ending just didn't work...,6,14 July 2021,"The film started off really good: I would say the first and second acts were great, but the third act lowered the film. The ending is supposed to make you feel nihilistic or unsatisfied, and it does achieve that, but it doesn't work all that well. The killer is still out there and the case is closed. The ending would've been fine if Denzel Washington's character didn't trick Jim into believing they actually got the killer. It makes no sense; if he was actually a good/experienced cop, then he wouldn't have made such a dangerous decision.Other than the undesirable ending, the film does great job at being a crime thriller. It's extremely intense, it always keeps you guessing, and it's very well paced. I was never bored during the movie because the intense scenes were so well paced apart. The directing and cinematography were also pretty good, and the main performances were decent.The Little Things ended up feeling pointless because of its ending. I generally like movies that end in an undesirable or sad way, but it has to work within the story, but in here, it doesn't. This movie is good on a technical level, and it does a pretty good job at being a crime thriller. In my opinion, this movie is slightly above average, so I'll give it a 6.",The Little Things

We slowly learn more about Deacon's past and how there might be some links between recent murders and cases that Deacon & Sal were investigating in the past.It's certainly not a thrill ride or full of excitement, but is a decently paced moody film, with a great score. Sparma (Leto) comes into it as a potential suspect. Each of the main three actors get a chance to shine in their own way, with Washington able to convey so much without words multiple times, and Leto does an excellent ""creepy"" with his gait & I assume contacts to make his pupils larger.There is constantly little reveals which keep things moving.

The point of any Film Noir is the detective story, and the bleak, dark environment that everyone exists int. In this stupid movie, boring replaced bleak, and plot-hole-ridden replaced dark. There was no detective work in this detective mystery.I love Rami Malek, but this was hugely miscast. This kind of story required someone who looks older and like life has done them in. Malek is neither of those things. They may as well have cast that baby-faced kid Elijah Wood, or Paul Rudd. He just doesn't look like a jaded, but dedicated detective.On that point, the ""no-one-cares-about-these-victims-but-us"" trope was SO poorly done, because at the end, the movie does not resolve the mystery. Is the viewer not supposed to care that we don't know what happened to them, let alone that the main character kills ones of them without consequences? Nobody in this movie was a good, dedicated detective at all.In the end, we find out that Denzel killed a surviving victim, and Malek killed an innocent, but sadly mentally unstable man. Are these our heroes? Truly, by the end of the movie, we know nothing about the mystery that the whole movie revolved around, except that Jared Leto's character definitively didn't do it. We just know that after Denzel killed a young woman, who would have otherwise survived her encounter with a serial killer, everyone in the police department covers for him. Such that even the medical examiner keeps evidence of his murder as a key-chain. What? Then, after Malek's character breaks all protocol and takes Leto into the desert to indulge the crazy man, Malek kills him. There... That's it. That's our movie.There was no point to this. Are we supposed to care so little for the dead girls that supposedly drive everyone to work harder than they've ever worked, that we don't care who killed them?

Similar to Edward Nortons Will Graham in Red Dragon. His character becomes tarnished by the end of the film. Rami Malek character as the fed Does offer a great performance though it's tiresome when you know that eventually they're going to end up teaming up with Denzel. As with many other movies Jared Leto always plays the creep who is suspected of being the killer. He doesn't show up till 50 mins into the movie.

Denzel looks his age, plumper, greyer, slower than ever (hey welcome to the 60's) but that fits into his role. He's harboring guilt and we get to know what it is much later, and he passes on the virus to his younger protegee. Unortunatly the RUFKM! moments are too rife, especially in the last 20 minutes. Leto, as the ""possible"" baddy is great, and it's his presence that keeps up the interest. Playing sociopaths is every actors wish. Malik is the weak point.

Of course, the trailer was only two minutes long. How does the actual film, which is over two hours long, compare? Surely any movie that expands on the technical prowess and acting chops that the trailer set up will be fantastic! The movie does expand on all of the pieces the trailer introduced - in doing so, ""The Little Things"" takes one step forward, and two steps back. Admittedly, the movie looks good visually; the cinematography is appropriately moody, with dim lighting for the majority of the running time that casts an ominous shadow over its characters.The acting, too, is incredible. I've seen mixed reviews on Rami Malek's acting in this movie, but I thought he was great, if a little mumbly, which did make it hard to understand him (thank you subtitles). Denzel Washington is, as always, great. He puts on a quiet performance here that takes its time with viewers - you can tell there's something below this character that's waiting to bubble up. Denzel is a professional, and he acts like one; every word out of his mouth feels believable, every action he takes feels realistic for his character. Watching him and Malik collaborate to catch a killer is truly entertaining - Deke sucks Jimmy into his obsessive mindset, and it's interesting watching both of them fall deeper into the rabbit hole they've dug for themselves.Jared Leto as the might be, might not be killer is fascinating. Now granted, I may be biased because I like Jared Leto, but I thought he was pretty good in the role. His character was perfectly bizarre, always keeping Deke and Jimmy on their toes. Sure, Jared's character may act like a complete weirdo, but is he a killer? The movie keeps you, and its characters, guessing, which I appreciated. The story, which obviously focuses on these three characters, is elevated by the amazing performances. In a better film, I could see some serious Oscar contenders.Yes, I did say ""in a better film,"" because ""The Little Things"" does start to fall flat. Let's talk about the editing - did Olivier Megaton secretly direct this? Who decided on the editing style of this movie? There were a distracting amount of cuts in practically every single scene - for example, a scene where Denzel says goodbye to his dog before getting in his car has probably upwards of ten cuts. Similarly, a scene where Deke and Jimmy are eating breakfast has probably 20 cuts. There is rapid fire editing at play here, and I'm not sure the reason why. The film would've greatly benefited from a slow and steady editing style that allowed the camera to linger on its scenes and characters; instead, we get something akin to Paul Greengrass, which definitely doesn't fit the tone of the movie.Because of that, tonally, the movie is inconsistent. The pace feels all over the place, with the film only picking up when Jared Leto's character comes in the picture. Unfortunately, he starts to play a major role about an hour or more into the movie, which means you spend a majority of this film's length focusing on nothing really memorable. Additionally, the movie felt too short, even though it was over two hours long. There had to be scenes cut out of here, perhaps even scenes that further expanded as to why Deke and Jimmy were so obsessed over Jared Leto's character. It seems like they pick him as a suspect out of thin air; as you hear in the trailer, they find him suspicious because his car has high mileage. That's it? After Deke discovers this, they seem laser focused on nailing Leto's character, and I was wondering if I somehow missed another clue or piece of evidence that made Deke and Jimmy get so fixated.I did really enjoy the ending and overall message of the movie - this is definitely not a crowd-pleaser, and I commend the so different approach that the movie took. However, I really can't excuse the awful editing and the stagnant pace. In a better movie, the first hour would've been the first 30 minutes, with Leto's character being introduced early to build the tension and obsession of Jimmy and Deke. However, because ""The Little Things"" spends its first hour on nothing too significant, by the time Jared's character is finally introduced you'll wonder what the movie can possibly pull out of its hat to keep you interested now that it's almost over. ""The Little Things"" is a film with great performances and a really interesting premise that is brought way down by its editing, pacing, and tonal inconsistency. It's a perfectly watchable film, but with this cast, it should've been much better than it ends up being.",The Little Things

133,itsbobr,Saved by the Second Half,7,29 May 2021,"In 1990, in Bakersfield, Deputy Sherriff Joe Deacon (Denzel Washington) goes to Los Angeles to pick up some evidence for a current case and ends up in LA involved in a hunt for a serial killer. Deacon used to be a Detective in Los Angeles, but had to leave as he couldn't solve his murder case, his wife divorced him and he had a heart attack. Now he's back in Lost Angeles and joins up with Detective Jim Baxter (Rami Malek) who replaced him. He notices similarities with Baxter's case and the one he became obsessed with years ago and he takes vacation days to help Baxter.If you take this out, FF the first half and get back to it when Jared Leto as Albert Sparma comes on the scene. Why? The scenes in the first hour jump around too much, many of the Cast mumble their lines and I had really no idea what was going on. The characters either talked too fast or mumbled their lines. I was at a loss, but I finally did get the idea that a serial killer was on the loose.The movie really starts and becomes most interesting when Deacon and Detective Baxter get together and decide that repairman Albert Sparma is the serial killer even though they had no real suspicion he was the killer. In fact, Leto's performance of Albert Sparma is the highlight of the whole film and he plays Deacon and Baxter perfectly. He was a breath of fresh air. Was he the killer? Hmmmm......Deacon likes to say there are the little things that will get you caught and eat you up if you let them. He knows from experience because he accidently shot a girl, a survivor, in his last murder case back in the day and many knew of it, covered it up, but wouldn't let him be promoted. Baxter will learn about those little things later on. Sparma tells Baxter he will show him where he hid Ronda Rathbun's body. Baxter agrees and goes with him. A mistake? Hmmm.......Notables: Terry Finny as Capt Farris, Deacon's old boss in LA and who warned Baxter not to get too close to Deacon; Michael Hyatt as Flo Dunigan, the Coroner, who along with Capt Farris covered up Deacon's accidental shooting of the girl in the case he became obsessed with and couldn't solve.This movie becomes much better after Jared Leto as Albert Sparma comes on the scene. The first half confused us and ran us around a lot, but nothing important happens except we see Deacon and Baxter working things out together.Washington and Malek are good actors, but this is a loosely told story and needed more structure or let's say better police work. Okay, okay or a better script. Here is what we know: the first half could have been better, but the second half saved it.

I'm not sure what his deal is lately, but since Dallas Buyers Club, he seems to have an uncanny ability to grab the crop and pick everything but the cream.The anterior characters don't add much to this weird, supposedly psychological thriller, and it seems as though WB was so desperate to put a flick in theaters and on HBOMax, so they threw good money at this awful excuse for a script.I think we're due for a better effort for Washington, now a senior statesman of the trash heap aka Hollywood and we need more quality choices if they expect anyone to pay attention to their crapfest.If you value your time, do t waste it on this.

141,pivic,"Badly written, awfully paced, partially overacted, and boring",1,5 February 2021,"The worst thing about this film isn't that it's snatched a lot from 'Se7en', nor the fact that it's attempting to lure its audience with three big Hollywood actors in it.The worst thing about this film is what a wasteful script it has.This film tries so hard to be all that David Fincher aspired to when he made both 'Se7en' and 'Zodiac', but contains none of the emotive allure.I got fairly excited when I saw actors from 'The Wire' and 'Oz' in this film, but nothing from the script excited me.Don't get me wrong: I didn't expect this film to excite me. If it'd been like Tarkovsky's 'Stalker', I'd be happy. I'm not.Rami Malek plays an investigator who tries to solve a serial-killer mystery. Malek has made his voice so deep that it irritated me throughout the film. Bar that, his playing mimics that from 'Mr. Robot', the TV series that made him fairly famous.Denzel Washington seems disengaged, not caring about this film at all. He's like a ghost, in a bad sense of the word.Jared Leto is quite the same as Washington.The main three actors probably don't have to make another film for as long as they live because they're wealthy, so in a sense, yeah, they chose to act in this film. I can't tell why. Leto overacts and most of what they do feels implausible.I will fault the writer, who also directed this boring mess of a film.The script contains a lot of vapid and audience-punishing film noir wannabe lines, stuff like 'He decided to suck a twelve-gauge'.People don't speak like that in real life.Even if this is just a fantasy film, consider how other, much greater noir-ish scripts were written. See one of the big films that Humphrey Bogart starred in, and you'll see what I mean.Compare this film with Dan Gilroy's 'Nightcrawler', a fim that Gilroy both wrote and directed, using far less money than 'The Little Things'. There was an atmosphere. It had grace.The main men in this tale are almost Gods: they feel and notice things. They're supernatural, not to be compared with the po-leese we know from 'The Wire'.Speaking of people, check out the non-people: women. They're poorly represented in this thing. They cook, entertain, are murdered. That's women for you.This film reminds me of 'Get Out', in the sense that I feel like everything is constructed, that the people in it, the dialogues, the interactions, everything felt contrived.Part of me wants to read the script to try and understand the minds of the people who financed this; I guess that the big Hollywood-actor names made up their minds, and not what's supposed to make this film.Don't see this.

As others have commented, the ending sequence is a little far-fetched, drags the story though the dirt, and otherwise muddies the great first and second acts.The acting is great throughout, and I was hooked on this one. The overall theme seems to float around the 'Moby Dick' story, i.e. one man giving everything to catch his white whale, but also thrown in the serial killer aspect and some darker truth revealed towards the end of the piece.The ending will irritate many people, as it is too vague. But perhaps that is what they were going for.

143,Lewis_Heather787,Disappointing ! Its just ok,6,3 February 2021,"This is one of those cases of a film having a better trailer than the film actually is. Maybe it was just me but that trailer pulled me in and I was really looking forward to check this film out. Overriding feeling is disappointment because this film should have been better considering the great actors involved, interesting story and good directing.Denzel Washington is just doing what Denzel does best, thats not really a shocker to anyone alive. He is the rock/centre of the film and yeah he is good. What else am I meant to say ? However sadly for me this film has set it in stone that I really really don't like Rami Malek. I'm sorry he was the worst past of the film for me, I don't think it was all his fault , maybe he was miscast in this role. He is just so plain, dull and just has this one tone of arrogance/self confidence that doesn't always work. (I never thought he deserved his Oscar and ever since then he has done nothing thats impressed me........worried about No Time to Die now). On the flip side probably the one actor that will get the most hate, I actually think was brilliant and the best part of the film. Jared Leto. Yes is he over the top and yes he does get type cast now as playing the creepy guy......however I'd argue at least he is good at it. The film for me at that point was coasting and dull until he became a more prominent role, it got better from then on.The main problem I have with the film is the fact that there is no major investigative work done. Its just a few questions asked here and there, all of a sudden they jump on Leto's character. Which we all know isn't the killer in the end. I would have liked it if Washington and Malek joined up more and there was longer to flesh out there characters and relationship. Maybe just reveal Leto in the final act or right at the end or the true killer. I was expecting something more like Zodiac or the mini series True Detective ??Overall I'd give it a 65% out of 100 or a 6.5 out of 10. Its ok. I feel that Malek was majorly miscast in the film, needed someone with a bigger screen presence to go along with Washington. The story was interesting but told in a really loose and weird way that never really explained much. Plus at the end tried to answer every little detail of the few pieces of information we had, it didn't need to do that. Leto was the best part for me.

On the surface it seemed like a solid detective about a serial killer set in the 90s and frankly speaking, the premise was interesting at the start. Unfortunately, the film felt like it was actually made in the 90s with a bland pace and a flat script that never managed to materialize the talent of the gifted cast.Starting off slow, as most detectives usually do, we get introduced to Denzel, an old school retired detective who is struggling with letting go of an old case. Coincidentally, Rami, an up-and-coming star detective, is working on an investigation with similar evidence. Denzel decides to lend a helping hand and together, they begin gathering the clues. This takes about an hour without any remotely exciting moments.Eventually, they run into Jared Leto and he manages to bring some sort of spark into the whole affair but because of the poor script, that spark never manages to ignite a flame. I tried to justify the decisions in my head but as the film progressed, the task became impossible until I eventually stopped caring. There aren't any twists or turns in the story as the film just stays in neutral until an equally disappointing ending. What's even more underwhelming is how these three actors were wasted in this excuse for a detective.

157,hunter-friesen,"""Little Things"" brings little to the table",6,8 February 2021,"The serial killer genre once was the biggest attraction at the cinema. ""The Silence of the Lambs"" (winner of Best Picture), ""Se7en"" and ""American Psycho"" ruled the box office and were made on big budgets with big stars. With prestige television shows like ""True Detective"" and ""Mindhunter"" taking up space in the genre, films shifted towards low budgets and horror, which can be seen in ""Saw"" and the rebooted ""Halloween"" franchise. As one of the first cinematic releases of 2021, Warner Brothers is offering to take us back with ""The Little Things"".Our story opens in 1990 Los Angeles as disgraced police detective Joe Deacon (Denzel Washington) returns to his old precinct. Immediately, he's sucked into a developing case led by young hotshot Jim Baxter (Rami Malek) that contains similar patterns to the case that destroyed his career many years ago. Young women are being followed to their homes and then stabbed to death by a sadistic killer. The prime suspect is a grimy crime buff named Albert Sparma (Jared Leto). Sparma may look and talk the part of a killer, but there's no evidence to link him to the murders. In order to stop the killings they suspect he'll do, Deacon and Baxter race against the clock to gather evidence in a city ravaged by fear.There's a line in the trailer, and also in the movie, that has stuck with me. At one point Deacon says that ""it's the little things that rip you apart and it's the little things that get you caught"".While he's describing how to cover up a murder, those same words can be said about making a movie. It's the little things like character development, an engaging plot, and a satisfying ending that can rip apart this type of movie. These are the little, or in this case, big things that hold ""The Little Things"" back from reaching the heights of its predecessors. Writer/director John Lee Hancock, who's had an average career with films such as ""The Blind Side"" and ""Saving Mr. Banks"" is the one to blame for this hollowness.Hancock, for the most part, has written and directed his films, which signifies a certain amount of uniqueness. Similar to Denzel's quote, I was also struck with the question of what exactly is a John Lee Hancock film? That question can be answered for many writer/directors like Quentin Tarantino, Woody Allen, or Kevin Smith. But for Hancock, there isn't something special he brings to the table. He doesn't have a style or any original substance. His films are no different than the usual made-by-committee studio fodder.To give him the benefit of the doubt, he does bring above-average craftsmanship with cinematography and can carry a tense mood for most of the picture. But he still makes the unforgivable sin of delivering a shockingly underwhelming ending to a whodunit mystery.Hancock's missteps also bleed into the central performances. As one of the best actors of a generation, Denzel Washington is incapable of doing wrong, which is why I'm only partially blaming him for his work here. There is a property in mathematics that stipulates that the product of any number multiplied by zero is zero. So, in the film's case, with the character of Joe Deacon having zero-depth, the amount of work he puts into his performance does not matter. He must have known this fact on set as he seems to be on autopilot and just doing a job for a paycheck.While Denzel knows he's too good for this material, Rami Malek proves he isn't good enough. His performance here is inconsistent, leaning too hard on the eccentricities and genre tropes of the rookie cop who hasn't tasted defeat yet. His Oscar win in 2018 for playing Freddie Mercury in ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" is looking worse with each subsequent role.As Sparma, Jared Leto is his best in years, even though that is an incredibly low bar since he's been nothing short of embarrassing since his 2013 Oscar win. Leto is fully hamming it up with his long greasy hair, odd mannerisms, and overall creepy demeanor. It may not be the most nuanced performance, but it sure is the most entertaining, which is worth something in this case.While ""The Little Things"" may amount to little, it's still a harmless return to the bigger budget serial killer dramas of yesteryear. In a time of year when there are fewer new releases, easy entertainment isn't the worst thing in the world.",The Little Things

161,deadbull-95171,I'm the 12th juror that disagrees with the other 11,9,16 August 2021,"I usually avoid reading personal or professional reviews to avoid influence. I only bought the New Yorker for Paulene Kael and liked Stanley Kaufmann etc.But I made a cursory glace at seveal comments and titles on this one and the common negativity struck me. Most expected Se7en, or expected a tale told P. O. V.From some astonishingly brilliant criminal. Or the editing around Denzel saying goodbye to hid dog etc.But what no one I saw did was take the movie on ITS OWN terms. How successfully did it accomplish what IT was trying to do. Then some comments were
confused about the final appearance of the red barrette, when to me what was going on was patently obvious. In that case it was made clear no less then 3 times
that Denzel harbored a very guilty secret, having mistakenly killed a girl, which the medical examiner helped him cover up. It accounts for his final hug of his
partner in the desert because they are brothers under the skin, except the partner doesn't know it. He's hugging Denzel because Denzel's lips are sealed, Denzel
is hugging a man who made the same life changing mistake he made, the REAL reason he had the triple bypass.The red barrette is a phony, something Denzel had delivered to his partner to help create doubt and ease his conscience that perhaps the crazy innocent killed
may really have been the guilty party. It's the last package Denzel throws in the trash, a second bag of new barrettes he bought with the red one missing.As for the wonderment of who fed the dog, the commentator must have had an ear blink when Denzel says to the dog, ""you disappear for 2 weeks and now you want some attention.""
The animal is a stray that Denzel feeds occasionally. IT'S ALL IN THE DETAILS. And this fine movie is full of them.Because a film does not meet what you expect does not diminish. Any writer, director, or actor or actress, working with the most patently derivative stuff, will try, in their way,
to do something a little different. Every revenge movie, or Western etc. Etc. Etc., by the nature of the genre will be derivative, and the spin here is to focus on the intricate
relations of the characters involved in a failed investigation. That is the focus and in that sense the film is relatively unique and largely a big success in accomplishing that,
which I think is it's intention.It's a study and everything is clearly stated in this movie, but mentioned in throw-away lines. How ""It's the little things that rip you apart""...like a dum dum bullet that killed a girl that a med examiner wears on a key chain, or an angry blow made with a shovel. Two decent devoted guys lives mutilated by 2 second mistakes, that had to be buried. That theme has been in too many crime movies
to count, mistakes hidden for the ""greater good.""One thing pointed out is that the flawed movie is only rescued by the good performances. I agree the performances were close to immaculate. I really dug Leo especially after seeing him play Lennon's killer, and Denzel is brilliant if he's doing Training Day or masterfully subtle as in this. But the point is , there is nothing amiss with the plot, the editing, or the pacing. There are 2 distinct flashes of a cross on the hill and the second one lets you know the first one was not some incidental irrelevant shot of the environment. Did you forget the conversation about god and Denzel's explanation of his perceptions in that regard?This is not a bang bang thriller. It is a successful depiction of character. The typical formula involves often boring courtroom scenes and boring stereotypic police work, and one looks forward to wild caperings of a brilliant insane criminal like the Joker as the only live spots in a movie.Would one dismiss a Laurel and Hardy film because it didn't include a few serial killers or spacecrafts? By the same token being different just to do something different doesn't make it automatically good either.But this was very good IMHO. And the Title applies to the architecture of the movie as well as its plot and theme and tone. It is subtle and intricate and you need to pay attention to it. Lines that may seem incidental are revealed to carry weight. It's a movie about failure. The good guys lose. The final scene mocks the FBI profiler brought in spouting the usual generic gibberish about who to look for.I happily admit I'm way more into character and mood then bang bang. This is not reservoir dogs or The Usual Suspects. They have made the cops as interesting as the criminals this time around. As a matter of,
it's the cops who are the only confirmed murderers in the whole sad story. It is a thoughtful, well integrated, highly detailed and very cohesive movie, and the negative reviewers aren't used to something like that, and frankly, I'm not either, so I found a lot to like here.",The Little Things

168,hoernkeem,"The Little Things review(2021, John Lee Hancock) Film is an incoherent mess",2,11 April 2021,"The Little Things (2021, John Lee Hancock)
'The Little Things' is a crime thriller written, directed and produced by John Lee Hancock who is probably most notable for the feel good films 'Saving Mr. Banks' and 'The Blind Side'. Here he directs a trio of talented actors caught up in a serial killer cat and mouse game. The promotional material made this film look sufficiently interesting and creepy, and it does have some heavyweight acting talent so how bad can it be? I wouldn't call this film horrible, but it does suffer from many narrative flaws and even these very talented actors, who are doing their best to hold it together aren't given enough good material to make the film very cohesive.There is a killer on the loose hunting women in Los Angeles. Rami Malek plays a detective that is heading up the case. Denzel Washington plays a former L. A. detective who left the force under a cloud and was exiled to Bakersfield although is still a police officer there. Circumstances have him return to L. A. where he gets caught up in these latest killings which is reminiscent of a case he had. Then there is Jared Leto who plays the random bizarre weirdo who lands on the detectives' radar and may just be the elusive killer. After initially butting heads Malek and Washington's characters end up working together to try to uncover the truth. Up until this point the film proceeds as a pretty standard detective thriller if a bit disjointed in the narrative. From that set up though events spin out in an off kilter, unexpected way that has you shaking your head by the end. The narrative continues in a disjointed fashion, and character decisions go well beyond the realm of believability for the story they are telling. Ultimately you figure out the story you think you are watching is not the story you are actually seeing. It starts as a simple catch the bad guy storyline and then it morphs into something else. The problem is that in that transition audiences are going to feel confused and duped when the narrative goes somewhere they completely weren't expecting. The twist that develops brings the two detectives' stories even closer together and is incredulous in that coincidence as well.Hancock has made some good films in the past, but here with seemingly complete control over the story he strays into some aberrant territory trusting the audience to watch and understand a film that they don't even know they are watching. The twists are so head scratching and the whole story so poorly constructed and the payoff so lackluster that other than the actors themselves this film doesn't really work in any way. It lacks focus and cohesion, even this group of actors who are all highly regarded cannot force this material to work in any meaningful way. I think this is meant to examine a bit more of the human condition and the psyche of a detective pushed to the breaking point, but even that examination or revelation is as flimsy as a hose of cards toppling over at the slightest breath of contemplation. I was expecting a taut, tense thriller and wound up with a befuddled mess.Eric's Grade: D.",The Little Things
169,michael-561-692892,Rami... why,5,10 February 2021,"Rami is great in Bohemian and Mr Robot because his character he's playing is an oddball. Playing a boring detective is not fitting.

I for one actually liked the ending and am thinking that maybe the ones who does not like where tired after two hours, and could not fully grasp it.Denzel is still going strong.

Washington is a former LAPD Detective who had a really bad case and ended up resigning and working for the county sheriff. Malek is someone he gets paired with. Jared Leto is a creepy laborer who is a ""true crime"" aficionado and thus has an unusually deep knowledge of various crime cases-- or at least, he portrays himself that way. But his actual guilt is... not quite what it seems.
The caliber of the actors is solid. But the results are extremely tepid.
I went into this expecting a high amount of suspense and genuine mystery, but it was not there.
Asides involving ""alive"" (though really dead) victims take you out of the narrative somewhat.
The ambiguous villain is extremely creepy. But there is no payoff at the end.
The cinematography is excellent, however.

It has so many parallels like the climax's are eerily similar.It does change Direction in its final act and does something to make it a little more memorable and individual.The acting is fine for the most part so edge slightly to the side of cartoon and feel a little out of place.The poster is gorgeous though, it really sticks in your head so there is a bonus.I don't know it wasn't really anything that I hadn't seen before.

Sadly The Little Things ended up being a subpar, extremely boring, slow paced crime thriller. The first half was even slower than the second, being a mixture of tiny bantering and confusing mumbo jumbo. The second half stepped it up slightly, especially once you get introduced to Jared Letos character, yet it's still painfully slow.
I was also disappointed with both Denzel and Rami Malek as they give some pretty dull performances, Leto honestly has the best performance in this film - but it's still nothing tow write home about.

Typically, I love Rami Malek's performances but here, you could have gotten a wooden door to act better than him. Every line he gives comes across as bland and boring and he puts hardly any emotion into his performance which really sucks. Denzel Washington did a decent job with what he was given and Jared Leto was pretty good. Leto stole the show in every scene he was in but it wasn't enough to save the film. It's a very confusing mess of a film. Nothing really makes sense and events kinda just happen without a lot of buildup except the ending. The ending was different and I wasn't expecting it but it left me feeling unsatisfied. The whole movie is around a string of murders and it seems like the movie is taking you in that direction but instead it doesn't explain anything. I'm okay with leaving a movie's main killer ambiguous but it feels weird when the film builds up that we are gonna find out who it is and then doesn't. The editing also was really choppy and pacing was all over the place. The beginning is incredibly slow and then the ending comes at breakneck speed. There were some well shot scenes, interesting color choices, and music but it isn't enough to keep this film afloat.

It's just a lot of the main characters walking around saying, ""Wanna go for coffee"" and then doing so, saying a few lines about the murders in the diner, and then on to the next scene!

There are so many inconsistencies, that there can only be one conclusion - editing had ruined much more fluid decent story.This is similar to recent Justice League. What we've got in 2017 was awful. What we got in Zach Snyder version is amazing, even though it was 4 hours long.You don't have to look further than the initial scene, about 3 minutes into the movie to find an example. Why did the girl got afraid? Why on earth did she stop in the middle of nowhere and started running instead of simply continue with the drive?

It's about those little decisions that we make that either define us, or do so if we allow them to. We are the result of all of those little things that we do. Denzel is as low-keyed as I have ever seen him, but that doesn't mean he's mailing it in. I don't think he has that in him.

Sometimes part of the fun of good noir thrillers is that we know in part what to expect; we never tire of cat and mouse, or good cop bad cop, or psychopaths played by famous actors - it's the nature of the genre and helps to ground us.What is left is the writer and director (namely John Lee Hancock, whose films seem popular, and star some amazing actors, and then I am continuously disappointed by them), and whoever was editing this thing. Nothing gels here. It's so languorous and flat that even the psycho misfit character gets tiresome and you want him to retreat back to Thirty Seconds to Mars.The plot is boring so I won't bother spending too much time describing it, and your eyes would glaze over anyway, but buddy detectives Baxter (Malek) and Deke (Washington) get lured into a case of dead women and psycho boy Leto toys with them yada yada. The main characters are so mournful and dour, and Leto is so bargain basement all-out psycho that the roles work against themselves, and everybody comes across as working within their own contrived bubbles and without adequate direction. Surprisingly even Denzel can't save face, and he's a man who commands such a presence that he should have carried this thing like it was his wheelhouse. Malek should never play a detective again until he grows facial hair and drinks some Red Bull.This is the kind of movie that holds promise to at least be a gripping yarn but when I realized how poorly directed and put together it all was, I lost focus and then became utterly bored and began to get angry at the squandered opportunity.",The Little Things

197,andrewrye-06535,Inconsistent and Messy,5,31 January 2021,"By all means watch the film if you are are fan of Jared Leto, Denzel Washington or Rami Malek. You will probably enjoy it regardless of what I or anyone says. I like to review a film as it's presented, not just throw a 10 at it because a certain actor/actress was in it.The story appeared to be a bit Film Noir and a bit True Detective but ended up being neither. (would love a well written True Detective with Washington and Malek). Film Noir needs a solid story line and actors who are expressive and smoldering in whatever role they play. Rami's over use of the 'stare' was off putting and in most cases totally unnecessary, a shame as it had potential to drive a plot point. It became just annoying after a while and I wondered if this was a one trick pony. He started off arrogant and self assured and ended up suddenly frail and broken. I wasn't convinced. An opportunity for the Denzel and Rami characters to play off each other was lost with Jim (Rami) just giving in to Deke (Denzel) without so much as whimper. Denzel Washington's character was supposed to be a broken ex-Detective who burned out and ended up losing his wife and family and having a heart attack. He was portrayed as an over-weight, unfit slob. Glad they told me because I would never have known. And he did pretty well getting his bulk up over a house, down the other side and running to the car without so much as breaking into a sweat. Add that to running down the street and taking steps lightly two at a time and the Denzel Washington long legged cat stride and it just didn't work with an over weight burn out. DW is not a method actor, DW plays DW and is best left to doing just. that. So the padding and back story was wasted. Jared Leto played Jared Leto just as he should have although made questionable decisions at the end of the movie. Always great to see him do the crazy.I don't mind stories that basically don't give you a neat end with everything tied up. This one didn't but what I don't like is the amount of red herrings that were just dismissed. The Stan character who kills himself and when asked if he might have been the serial killer Deke responds 'I hope not'. Really? after hounding him in a previous life for old murders, taunting him with a dead woman's name to see his reaction (and he gave a reaction) that's the response. A bit lame. There was little connecting the title to the movie. They looked at lots of 'Little Things' and they added up to nothing. I kept wondering when the big reveal would be to convince me that Zeke was as good as we were told all the way through the movie, it never happened. the reveal could have been anything, not the murderer but a major point that we all missed. Nothing. the best writing seemed to be for Sparma, loved the car swap on the highway, the call for a cop down and he just watched the action. Certainly livened up an otherwise dull story that went no where for 2 hours.I gave it a 5 for Sparma and the almost a good movie vibe. But really, maybe they should have used cell phones.

As others have said, Jared Leto is fantastic as the guy who...well, he may be the killer or he may just some some moron who willfully provokes angry policemen into thinking he's the killer. We'll never know.
Denzel is always great, but the dude who played Freddie Mercury is not realistic as a seasoned detective.
By the way, right off the bat, a small-town deputy from a rural area in the dust north of Los Angeles would NOT be asked ""Hi, wanna come along for a ride to an active crime scene and help LAPD?"" Unrealistic from the get go.
Yes, in the real world, some crimes are unsolved and some killers are still out there. But this is not real. It's a movie, and the writer/director owed the audience, at the very least, to sum up who the killer was.",The Little Things
203,garethvk,The Little Things Is A Star Powered Thriller Not To Be Missed,9,28 January 2021,"Academy Award Winners Denzel Washington, Jared Leto, and Remi Malek star in the new thriller ""The Little Things"" and combine to make very gripping and memorable performances.The script was reportedly written over thirty years ago by John Lee Hancock who has gone on to write, direct, and produce multiple films of note in the decades since he first created the screenplay.The film is set in 1990 and involves a cop named Joe Deacon (Denzel Washington), who travels from his small California town to Los Angeles to get information on a suspect.Joe has a history in L.A as he used to be a homicide detective for the department which combined with his meltdown while obsessing over a murder case has caused him more than a bit of notoriety.Jim Baxter (Remi Malek) is the hotshot new Detective who has been leading the investigation into a string of unsolved murders. Joe accompanies Jim to a new crime scene and notes some similarities with his unsolved case.Joe takes some personal days and begins to do some legwork on the case and reports his findings to Jim which causes Joe to remember aspects of what drove him to his marital, health, and career issues as he is unable and unwilling to let the case drop.When a prime suspect no longer fits into the picture; suspicions fall on a crime enthusiast named Albert (Jared Leto) who seems to check all the boxes but is also taking delight in winding up Joe which causes Jim to question if he is a viable suspect or just an oddball who gets off on crimes and winding up the cops but does not actually commit any offenses.As the delicate dance unfolds between the characters the fact that this is an era before Cell Phones, DNA tests, GPS, and elaborate computer networks helps underscore the plight of the officers. If the film was set in a modern setting much of the suspense and uncertainty of the story and characters would be moot thanks to technology.As the game of cat and mouse unfolds between the characters Jim learns how a person can become obsessed with a case and Joe attempts to mentor him from the success and failures of his life which includes some gray areas.Aside from the strong performances and engaging story what makes ""The Little Things"" work is that it is a film that does not take the Hollywood fallbacks of extended gunfights, car chases, and over the top action scenes. What it does show is real and flawed characters that are doing what they think is right and does not attempt to wrap things up in a nice and tidy package.The film uses the element of doubt to not only drive the story but to help motizate the actions of the characters and underscore the elements of uncertainty exists in some investigations.ambiguity also puts the focus on how investigations and procedures have evolved with the resources available to police.The film will appear in cinemas and HBO Max and is a compelling and well-crafted thriller that is not to be missed.4.5 stars out of 5",The Little Things

Denzel Washington as a senior deputy sheriff stumbles his way through the film and has some uninspiring lines to deliver. Rami Malek with his characteristic smirk and mumble does not look or behave like a crack LAPD detective he is supposed to portray. The film is terribly slow and lethargic. The cinematography for some reason highlights dull interiors of seedy hotel rooms and dark morturies which depresses viewers all the more. ( Moody cinematography ?)

Like a 80's cop thriller without the 80's magic.I mean, it was not all that bad, but not that good either. Denzel movies tend to much better than this. I felt Jared Leto was the only one who made a real effort to stand out in this movie. He did a good job. This kind of reminded me of Cop Land with Stallone. Where he is fat, half speed and broken.

215,RJBrez,"Realistic, thought provoking ending",9,30 January 2021,"The Little Things just blew my mind. I loved it, and yes I even loved the ending. Here are a few reasons:1) The cast was incredible. We've come to expect this from Denzel, Malek, and Leto and they did not disappoint. The way they all portrayed these flawed characters was beautiful to me. I was even impressed with the surrounding cast. They knocked this out of the park.2) The setting/time: Let's face it. Movies from this time frame are just better. No cell phones or social media to bog down the story or assist the characters in any way. It also makes the story more possible/feasible. What stories can people tell from modern times ? Most people just sit around online..boring. So I love this time period.3). The ending. From the moment you meet Denzel and anyone else he knew from his past, you can tell something was wrong. I could tell it was more than just a case. His character was literally haunted by his past. His former partner wanted him gone immediately, which should have been a red flag to viewers. I also was glad it did not follow the typical serial killer trope. Leto portrayed a man that was almost too obvious as the killer and it worked. Anyone who disliked the ending probably just doesn't like to be fooled.I loved this movie. The only reason I do not have a perfect score is that I wish there was more about Denzel and his past. But I understand there is only so much time to tell a story.

218,ObsessiveCinemaDisorder,Great cast and ambitious attempt at bringing something new to the crime genre but forgets to be convincing,6,13 February 2021,"""It's the little things that are important, Jimmy. It's the little things that get you caught.""Denzel Washington's latest crime thriller, The Little Things, which he stars as deputy sheriff Joe Deacon, teams up with Rami Malek's LA detective Jim Baxter to find a serial killer whos methods are similar to an unsolved case from his past.Writer-director John Lee Hancock seems fascinated with police work and presents a slice-of-life look inside the life of police investigation. Typically when a movie cop gets a hunch; more often than not, that hunch leads them to the killer. In this film, we experience how frustrating and murky the crime detection process can be. As time passes, the killer is more likely to get away, and yet everything moves at a glacial pace.All three Oscar-winning actors all show up to work, each giving a different type of performance; Denzel's is naturalism, Malek's is minimalism, and Leto's on transformation.Denzel's performance is simple and believable as a despaired police officer wrestling with pain from his past. Joe Deacon is as disturbed as the criminals he's searching for. He hangs up photos of dead victims and looks at them in the dark every night. The ghosts of his past all literally manifest and stare back at him like a scene out of The Sixth Sense. We know that something tragic happened to Joe but it is not revealed. Knowing the script was written in the nineties (two songs used in the film were also in Sister Act), the Joe Deacon character does feel genetically linked to Denzel Washington's past detective characters from his 90's crime thrillers.A lot of reviews have been saying Rami Malek should have played the suspect due to his unconventional looks. I think what's happening is the director cast him against type in a leading man role and the audience isn't ready to see him that way yet and automatically recognizes Denzel as the star. It's too soon. I remember a similar case with Dane DeHaan in Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets.Malek's detective Jim Baxter stares a lot. It's that particular stare people do to deliberately prolong a silence to force the other person to elaborate. It feels like someone is just studying you the whole time and police officers employ it as an interrogation technique. Malek's performance was fine, even though he does not land the leading man status that the role requires.Once Jared Leto's character shows up at the 1-hour mark, the film kicks into high gear. Albert Sparma is a fascinating character. Greasy, beer-bellied, and walking with a drag, Sparma is an outsider that society neglected and ignored but is highly intelligent and funny. What's particularly fresh about Sparma is the film openly lets the audience interpret whether Sparma was the murderer.There's a vague sense that Sparma is guilty, or committed some crime, that or he's just unnervingly sketchy to be around. I leaned toward thinking Sparma was innocent. He both loves and hates attention from authority figures. He enjoys the police's attention to toy with them for his own amusement.The Little Things takes its sweet time effectively builds suspense and even simulates the tediousness of police stakeouts where officers just sit all day in a car tailing a suspect. Joe Deacon and Jim Baxter even philosophize whether there's any point sitting there waiting for a suspect to make a mistake.At times, the slow build is undercut by attention-deficit editing. Any given scene, like a conversation between two people, will cut back and forth excessively like a puppy doing a triple take between its two owners.At the climactic point, there is a point where the audience has to majorly suspend their disbelief and go along with the film for it to say what it ultimately wants to say. I like what was said. John Lee Hancock shows real artistic ambition in bringing something new to the detective noir mystery genre. I just wished the way we got to that point was more convincing.Once the film was over, you realize what happened was hard to swallow and that the story as a whole actually doesn't hang together. Unfortunately, the film's reach far exceeded its grasp and it failed to rise above the sum of its parts. What it came down to was the script needed another pass, which is an unfortunate thing to say about a script that was been written a decade ago.I enjoyed The Little Things as a one-time experience. It had some fantastic themes and ideas that feel fresh to crime films. I even loved the overall message but it forgot to be convincing.",The Little Things

220,Opinion02122,Really?,6,30 January 2021,"My first reaction stayed with me throughout. Denzel's character was blah! He acted like he hated the world and just did his job because he had to. He was overweight and sloppy. He acted like his life was one of existing, not living. He went to California because his boss made him. He met old friends, but seemed not to care. He was one sorry soul and a huge bore. I kept trying to figure out why anyone liked him at all!Rami has never been a favorite of mine, and this movie didn't change my opinion. He starts off as a cocky guy who was SO upset that there was someone he didn't know on his turf, that he couldn't even continue his presentation and kept stopping just to stare at Denzel. Then, suddenly he seemed not only to accept him, but invite him into his investigation. All the while both characters showed no personality at all.It got to the point where I just didn't care who the killer was.

Many reviews have said the ending did not work with the movie or the ending fell short. The problem was not the ending, but the rest of the movie. With a cast like Washington, Leto and Malik, the movie should have been a home run, and as far as acting goes, it was (though Malik was awkward at times). The story needed much more thrilling moments to be considered a ""psychological thriller"". The pacing and thrilling moments were just too slow. Leto was great as a suspected sociopath, however, the movie significantly underutilized him. I would have liked to see Leto taunting the police more often through his actions, more clues alluding to him being the killer, and the frustration continuing to mount with Washington and Malik from knowing they have caught the killer, yet can't do a thing about it. That would have made the ending so much more satisfying or understood when Malik's character finally ""lost it"" with Leto's character. Overall, I wouldn't call it a loss, but I don't think it's a movie I would watch again...Leto needs another opportunity to play a sadistic psychopath in the future because he played the character wonderfully.

This is NOT a David Fincher film even though Leto was in ""Fight Club"" and drinking the same Busch Beer.
When this script was first written, Paul Keating was Prime Minister of Australia and Meatloaf was on top of the Aussie charts and could still sing.
I'd do anything for Denzel, but I won't do that.
They've even set this big screen box office hit in the early 90's.
Washington stars as a burnt out County Deputy Sheriff who's been demoted from suited LA Detective to uniform for something in his dark past that will all be revealed by films end.
His Joe ""Deke"" Deacon is shrewd and calculating (a regular Columbo) and he teams up with Rami Malek's ""Jim Baxter"" to solve a string of serial killer crimes with a similar MO to an old unsolved crime that ended badly.
If i've learnt anything from life crime does not pay, but then again neither did my long radio/journo career.
So, what are you gonna do?
The real thrill in this movie is Jarod Leto as the super creepy, ""Albert Sparma"" a Sparky by day and by night possibly our serial killer, but let's not get ahead of ourselves.
I'd like to know how a po' boy can afford not one, but two classic cars on his wage and lives in a dump.
In fact, we don't even hear him speak until the end of the first half of this 2 hour celluloid marathon.
""The Little Things"" that make this work are the great performances from its central cast, the grimy cinematography plus a stand out soundtrack of Golden Oldie love songs that are handpicked for each scene so listen closely to the lyrics.
The #metoo movement won't approve of this film because most of the women are victims of vicious crimes and there are no strong female roles.

They also bend the rules a lot. Covering up their own mistakes and crimes.
The acting is good from everyone, Leto is perfect as the ambiguously guilty weirdo. The editing and directing not so much. My biggest problem is that Baxter accepts Sparma's invitation.

Bravura performances by Denzel and Leto, but Chris Bauer somehow outperforms both. He also delivers the one well-written, laugh out loud in gale-force, line in the film (I won't spoil it here). To have an embarrassment of medallion level talent in one place and throw it all away with a saggy, twaddle heavy script seemingly phoned in from dial-a-cliche and a blatant disregard for rudimentary editing takes this from tragedy to travesty. I found myself wishing that the serial killer would take a straight razor to about 66% of the cringe-worthy dialogue and 33 minutes of pointless, really bad reel time.

229,PerryAtTheMovies,Don't watch the trailer if you want to enjoy this film....,6,6 February 2021,"A trio of award winning leads that keep the pace going and the tension building throughout. Definitely worth watching on a Friday night.Initial Thoughts:
With movie theatres still closed and no real blockbuster films coming out until later this year. It is hard to get excited about new movies. Going into ""The Little Things"" I decided that I wouldn't watch the trailer. This was to help me try and enjoy the film more. It kind of worked. The storyline doesn't standout as anything spectacular, but what is does do, is take the world of the police detective and puts on a view of the psychological aspect of that job.The acting was decent. I found it hard to read Rami most of the movie, but he did well in playing a detective not willing to show all his cards in the first moments of the game. Denzel also does well with covering his emotions as his character deals with the present and the past. Lastly, Jared Leto does a good job of running his mouth until he can't run anymore. All to say, the mostly emotionless expressions of each lead makes it a bit difficult to read their thoughts and motives, but additionally adds to the tension of the film.Going back to earlier where I stated that I didn't watch the trailer before the film. If you decide you want to watch a new movie that is psychological and thrilling this film may be for you, but I'd suggest not watching the trailer either. The story flows very well in my opinion, although it did slow down for a bit. The speed at which the tension is being built worked out almost perfectly. It was hard to believe that two hours had gone by. In my opinion, if you've happened to have watched ""Promising Young Woman"" or ""Let Him Go"", you'll find the ending to this film to be similar, but not as great as the aforementioned films.Overall:
This two hour thriller was great to watch on a Friday night. I would probably watch it again. My best suggestion is to watch the film without watching the trailer, but it ultimately your call. The trio of leads offer enough to keep the flow of the film going and the tension rising. By the end you should be at the edge of your seat with that anticipation having been built-up only to have it all come crashing down.""Should I watch this movie?"" My answer is 'Although I've rated this 6/10. I would still say yes you should watch it.'Enjoy the show!",The Little Things

Almost a 7.,6,30 January 2021,"A good, characterful slow burn standard fare cop movie if you like character over action and don't expect a great twist at the end. Washington and Leto give solid, at times exceptional, performances and it is worth a watch just for those.The only weak link is the miscast of Rami Malek. His character seemed to be a pale imitation of Guy Pearce's character from LA Confidential in the beginning (without having the chops to pull it off) but his character quickly morphed into a sidekick-type to Denzel's much stronger lead and eventually a patsy to Leto's.
There wasn't a real character arch to show why he had the sudden change so it seems unnatural. His acting was cheesy and more caricature than character.I have enjoyed Malek in several productions but think he is much better as a creepy nerdy type, not a leading man. He completely ruined Bohemian Rhapsody for me with his limp performances and constant teeth sucking. I hope to see him cast more to his type in the future because honestly, much as I like him, I don't think he is a great actor but is effective as a creep.

235,blackoutH,Incredible cast in a forgettable movie,6,20 June 2021,"Denzel Washington, Rami Malek and Jared Leto together in a movie should be reason enough to watch, and that's exactly what I did.This tells the story of a former detective now deputy, that due to specific circumstances gets himself entangled again on a 5 year old crime investigation he was involved in and that ended horribly. The criminal was never caught but it seems he strikes again and now the deputy and the new detective are caught together in this man-chase.The plot itself is not bad, but also nothing new, it's a very slow paced movie which wouldn't be necessarily a bad thing if the characters were allowed for more freedom to showcase their inner emotions or even some background or motivations. It's a very sober crime drama with an unconventional ending (again nothing new but still unconventional) and although the message in the final moments is clear I don't think it made much sense given how the criminal was presented to us, the ambiguity would be fine if both scenarios made sense but for me one of them doesn't.The acting as you would expect is on point but I had high expectations for a film with these 3 amazing actors and usually your feeling towards a movie can be traced back to expectations for the most part.",The Little Things

But, it was the ending 15 minutes or so that really put the nail in the coffin! It requires the viewer to pay attention, to some obvious foreshadowing details provided earlier in the film. They're not mind bending... but they certainly raise an eyebrow.I'm giving a 7, because it's in the perfect range of 6.5 (a little above average).

I liked him in the TV series with C. Slater, but I'm one of the few that feel his stock fell as Freddy Mercury where he was overacting and could not watch it all the way through. In this flick he seems to have continued on the same trajectory, with that weird pout, making him seem oafish. After this movie I'm thinking his talent may be overrated, there may not in fact be that much to him as an actor after all. He may turn out to be the next Billy Zane or Eric Roberts.
Looking past all that, however, it is a decent enough movie. More a drama, I thought than thriller, because it was slow paced and action low, but dialogue heavy. which I don't mind, because the writing was decent.

Denzel Washington is very good, but while I like Rami Malek as an actor I just couldn't quite buy him as the character he plays in this. I thought pretty much anyone could have played Jared Leto's character better and don't get the hype there at all.The last third seemed quite silly though the end twist was good. Interesting that its a period film. I read something about it which mentioned the script has been sat around unmade since the 1990's and watching the film you could see that. It feels very much like a second rate 90's thriller in the writing. Its a very watchable film, but not one I'd ever bother to see again.",The Little Things

So basically they chase a suspect and finally end up killing the suspect. Both Denzel and Rami Malek then clear off any evidences because they made a mistake of killing the suspect. So, in the end, the viewer doesn't even know whether Albert Sparma (Jared Leto) is actually the killer or not. Gosh! The last 10 mins were the worst slow burns ever....this movie has a very very bad storyline in the first place. The story has lost its direction completely. From 1:00 hour till 1:47 the story will keep you gripped thanks to Leto's performance which is the sole reason I sat through this garbage.Please come up with better scripts.

I assume it's all good then.If this is in theaters I'm mildly curious how well it's doing, but as part of my home HBOMAX subscription it's okay. Kind of reminds of the Outsider series, where everything's dark, mysterious, and lots of creepy music.Not to rant on the current viral crisis, but I think it's taken a toll on cinema these days.

Actors do projects for all sorts of reasons, but let's just say that Washington, Malik and Leto were slumming and leave it at that. Leto, as always, was very interesting. (He seemed to be filling in a lot of blanks in the script.) Malik seemed determined to demonstrate that he can be more than just Freddie Mercury. (He can be, of course, but his unique look is always a reminder.) Washington could have phoned it in. (Maybe he did.) Well photographed, but the sound alternated from fair to dreadful. And that, coupled with the actors muttering many of their lines, was very distrtessing. (Perhaps they feel it makes them seem serious. Perhaps, but their words still need to be clear.) John Lee Hancock, who wrote, produced and directed, needed someone looking over his shoulder. It still would be a TV movie, but it could have been a much, much better one.",The Little Things

The screen play is maddeningly uneven but worse yet the direction likes to think that long, meaningless shots are necessary (lots of driving; really an awful lot of driving!), especially when interwoven - incoherently - with episodes from Denzel's past.The plot begins to sag in the second act, and in the third it just falls and falls and spirals into a very long death. Had the script been tightened, the film would work far better if it lost at least half an hour and had a director who knew when to yell ""Cut""!Denzel Washington is showing his age (especially in one groaningly unnecessary shot of him going up a staircase, shot from ground level; the man needs to go on a diet), but does his best with a one-dimensional character. He needs to learn to say ""No"" to roles that have action sequences (watching an old, overweight man crawl up a roof is painful, not only for us but probably for Denzel, too). Jared Leto, who also looks like he could visit the gym more often, does his usual one-dimensional creepy dude act and is, as always, successfully creepy.I have to go with a 7, which is probably overly generous, but I do so strictly for the performances, not the content or the movie as a whole.

255,cristinalinderman,A dull-misfired crime film.,4,31 January 2021,"*There is no end credit scene *The director John Lee Hancock and the crew brought a dull-misfired crime film. The story is about a deputy sheriff and a detective tracking down a serial killer. I thought I was going for an intense ride because the opening sequence was incredible and it sets wonderfully what the film was going to be about in such a suspenseful way. I felt deceived because after the opening the whole film went downhill, it struggled so badly to find its grip and it kept sinking until the very end. One of the things I disliked was how the ending was similar to another film called Seven (1995) it was still different but it takes the core making this film not original and very annoying on what it tried to do. Also at the earliest, one can easily know how it will end, even though it was predictable I get what the film was trying to achieve by ""The Little Things"" but the attempt lacked suspense.The composer Thomas Newman brought the right kind of music though it such a shame it couldn't save the movie. This music would have been better off with a better script for one to appreciate it fully.The cast was impressive and the three main actors Denzel Washington, Rami Malek, and Jared Leto are magnificent actors but their performances in this film were sloppy and very irritating. Sometimes some of the performances felt so eager and not in a favorable way. I wouldn't call it a messy script it was more like no one wanted to put real effort into making this film. This was a poor script with a careless direction.",The Little Things
256,FilmChamp20,Watch before you read my review,7,30 January 2021,"I understand the frustration of the ending. I was going to write off this movie as bad. Then I thought for a little bit.Here's my theory:
I believe Albert wasn't the killer. I know that's a common consensus. I don't think Deke or Jimmy was either. However, the confusion and frustration of not getting an answer from the film is actually the result expected. We, as an audience, are to feel just as lost and frustrated with the unknown and unresolved as Deke and Jimmy do. To feel just like how it is to be a obsessive Detective to the point where your perception has become so skewed from obsession, you're desperate for an answer. To the point where you break and it has consequences. Perhaps to show us how being a dedicated detective has its weight that finally breaks them down. Deke knows this finally, as Jimmy's situation wakes him up, however, he doesn't want Jimmy to become him. Thus buying the red clip to assure Jimmy that Albert was actually the killer, thus making him feel justified in killing him. While in reality, it wasn't Albert and it's another burden that Deke has to carry on with within his conscious.All in all, I believe the movie is to show the best of the best get a breaking point at some point, not wanting to admit defeat or that they just aren't as good as they used to be. Because all the sacrifices they give to dedicate their time into finding the killer or victims, they want it to be time that was well spent instead of time wasted making their life miserable.",The Little Things

But yes, it's about entertainment as this is not a documentary and none of these characters are real. ""It's the little details that get you caught."" True. It's also the little details that make this movie a little bit ridiculous and melodramatic.On the plus side, I really enjoyed watching this movie. Yes I did. It's not only an interesting character study of three imperfect men, each with a little bit of darkness in their personality profile, but the storyline is unique in that the focus is entirely on the men, not action, not chase scenes, not gun fights and not the victims or their families"" grief. And without (cliched) police/crime action scenes, it is still very suspenseful, thanks to the intricacies of the character development and ongoing open ended questions about the motivations of each character.Moreover, the musical score is terrific - creepy, atmospheric and well balanced, never overpowering or distracting. It added a lot.The acting is generally very good, with nuance and attention to detail. Sometimes the acting was a little heavy handed, and there are at least a few scenes that border on the absurd in my opinion (again, people don't do some of these things in real life). But for me this is simply Hollywood entertainment. So just sit back and enjoy it for what it is.I think what prevents this from being a great movie is the fact that I was constantly aware of the theme of ""real life vs Hollywood"" throughout in all the scenes. In a great film, the audience is supposed to lose itself in the film itself. In other words, no matter how unrealistic a scene is, it still feels like it ""could"" be real, or at least the audience isn't given a sense of disbelief. In this movie, a lot of the scenes never felt authentic. This is a flaw with the script and directing.I, however, was NOT bothered nor confused by the ending. For me, it felt like closure. I also enjoyed the ending because it seemed to flow with the rest of the movie. I did not expect more and it did not feel like a sudden stop.

Denzel appears tired at times & weary, possibly of his character. There's no chemistry between the 2 main characters. The bad guy is the only interesting part which lasts briefly.

Rami Malek plays his foil as a new hotshot LAPD detective. Meanwhile, Jared Leto shows up midway through the proceedings in his trademark creepy killer (or is he?) mode. While these kind of cop vs serial killer movies are always welcome these days, and Washington is his usual exemplary self, the movie itself doesn't pop like it should. In a late scene, Rami Malek is skulking around in a dark deserted street with a loaded gun. Would you sneak up behind him and say ""Boo!"" ? The details just doesn't quite mesh, the tone is a bit off, and crucially, the interplay between the two leads is merely perfunctory. It's ""the little things"" that cock up this movie. Not a bad way to spend 2 hours, but certainly, nothing spectacular here. You'd be better off rewatching True Detective season 1 (which I just did).",The Little Things

That is the cheapest way for someone who appreciates a film to make those who do not feel as if they are to 'slow,' to get what is shown. As far as police dramas go, this is one to forget. This is the most most boring, going nowhere movie I've seen since Wonder woman 84. It is about 2 hours of fake suspense. This is a case of a bunch of good actors in a bad movie. I have no idea why Jared Leto takes these roles, where he is barely on screen and has a few lines. It is similar to Suicide Squad. He's a good actor, use him! Denzel phones it in.

Not exactly Academy Award material - but at this point we just don't know.Denzel and Rami, both Academy Award winners, play competitive cops who find out eventually that they have more in common than previously thought and apart from trying to find a serial killer. Their performances are competent if not stellar. The more than adequate performances of the supporting roles more than adequate and ably support their roles.As a added plus, The Little Things is filmed entirely on location in Southern California.

The plot seemed interesting at first but was written poorly and didn't make sense after a while. I also expected more from it.Denzel Washington (Joe Deacon) was great and carried the film in terms of acting. I actually liked his character, despite the odd backstory. Rami Malek (Jimmy Baxter) was alright, but that's about it considering his character was very bland and underdeveloped. I've seen people praise Jared Leto's (Albert Sparma) performance. However, I didn't like it and thought he tried too hard. The script was poor, so they weren't given much to work with.This film was boring and had a slow pace. It started off promising but dragged out soon enough. The ending was very confusing and I still don't know what it meant. We never even find out who the killer is which was the whole point of this movie.

It wants you to see the important of the job that these detectives do but it revolves around their ego instead of the actual work.Pretty weird if you ask me. The movie is a huge contradiction, whether it's atmosphere, relationship between the main characters and a serious job taken as a joke. The plot itself is not that bad and well cliche of course. But there are so many plot holes, because the end proves the movie to be absolutely pointless.So because of all of this, I want to give it a high mark but also a low one.

I think in the end both the protagonists (Washington and Malek) get some kind of closure.

Little things tries to be unique crime thriller from hollywood. The movie has a standard cast with Denzel Washington, Raimi Malek and Jared Leto handling the lead roles. Leto looks entirely unrecognisable in his new avatar which is different in terms of all aspects including dialect,walking style and much more. Denzel Washington is yet another person to watch out for in this crime drama. The major engaging moments of the movie are the explicit victim body reveals along with its good piano background score. The plot is extremely different from usual crime thrillers and at times is too unpredictable. Cinematic camera angles and its changing background scores elevates the movie at times. There are parts where the movie is engaging especially with all the explicit photographs, shocking body reveals and much more.The movie has some major cons including its A lister cast which only helps in increasing the audience's expectations. The movie is extremely slow and realistic at times which might not be everyone's cup of tea. I expected Leto to do something unexpected till the very end but nothing comes from his part. The movie is boring near the end and certain lag is also felt.The climax of the movie is open ended as well as highly subjective one.

Why? Pay attention to the cars shown when the girls are targeted. The blond in the opening scene, Tina, a dark Pontiac with a white pinstrip (I believe) was being driven. The next girl, the runner with the red barrette, it was a tan square-body looking car. Both the vehicles Sparma owns are not these vehicles. Of course, the detectives wouldn't know this, just the viewers.We also know that when the girl in the apartment was killed that someone was watching from the abandoned building across the street. Was there a camera setup and only one guy killed her? Or was one guy doing the killing and a 2nd guy was watching?Perhaps Sparma was so bold in his interactions with the detectives, toying with them like he did, because he wasn't the one who did the killing so he had a certain confidence about him, not to mention his weirdo behavior. He knew exactly what happened & who did it, but he didn't necessarily do it himself. Maybe a friend of his who had access to various vehicles was the actual murderer? But both were in on it together?Just some thought provoking details to point out.In the end, we are left with two corrupt cops and complicit friends doing the autopsies & forensics. Deke didn't want Jimmy to end up with the same ""ghosts"" as he has and went out of his way to protect Jimmy's mind along with his beliefs. And no ""for certain"" answers as to who the murderer was, although a good bit of the evidence the viewers were shown would lead us to side with the corrupt detectives beliefs.",The Little Things
331,redroominparis,John Doe does NOT have the upper hand,4,3 February 2021,"Hancock's cheap ripoffs of Fincher are hard to swallow here, as The Little Things does little to separate its blatant similarities to a little known film, (to most current film buffs) Seven. There are many problems, most evident, an aging and uninspiring Denzel. As he is perhaps one of my favorite actors of all time, his performance relies on his nuances. This is a common approach for him. That being said, they usually have something to do with the character he has developed. Here, they come off flat and disingenuous. Jared Leto is possibly the worst actor in the film. There is no emotional depth, just a a reliance on his turn as the Joker. You could have put anyone in this role. It was completely empty. Malek continues to put forth a tremendous effort, and his approach had more than his co-stars, and made the movie watchable. Everything else in the film required a suspension of disbelief that violates the watchers intelligence, and that of its cast. Then ending is a complete rip off, with a twist that feels like bland, runny scrambled eggs. I implore you. Watch Seven, then watch this film. You will understand, and at the least, revisit or discover a truly affective film.",The Little Things

336,timmyhollywood,"A safe, flat film that feels made by a corporation",5,7 February 2021,"Other reviewers have covered a lot of it: tonally, The Little Things is all over the place. The editing is whack. And the story is sort of flat. So, why bother adding my voice to the choir?Because I think there's a larger problem here.Looking through writer/director John Lee Hancock's filmography, this film is a little sub-par for him, but not by much. Mr. Banks and The Blind Side seem to be viewer favorites; 7.5 and 7.6 respectively. But perhaps you've noticed something more broadly disconcerting lately than one ho-hum film in a filmmaker's oeuvre: There seems to be a downward trend in quality of movies overall.I know, people have been saying that for decades. Maybe centuries. The sky is falling and art is dying.But it's true, and William Blake said it best: ""When nations grow old, the arts grow cold, and commerce settles on every tree.""Maybe The Little Things isn't the worst cash-grab offender. We can easily criticize the glut of remakes and bad comic book movies that have plagued us for at least a quarter century. But The Little Things still seems to suffer for its attempt to be unoffensive, to please as wide an audience as possible. It has a corporate-made feel, like so many movies of the brave new digital age.The story has the recognizable elements of a crime drama. But beyond that foundation, it's a hodgepodge. Some scenes feel stolen right from the script for Se7en: when Denzel Washington wonders aloud if the tedium of a detective's life is worth it, it echoes the (far better) scene when Morgan Freeman poses the same question. And having the suspected killer drive two detectives out to the middle of nowhere with a promise of revealing a victim? That too feels stolen from David Fincher's 1995 film.It's not the stealing which concerns me. All stories are derivative. Se7en itself is borrowing from Milton, among others. But the film knows that. The film knows what it is and what it's saying. The Little Things does not. It *thinks* it's trying to say something about ultimate justice, or something, but nothing beyond a few lines and final twist support it. The movie is at times goofy, at times playing like an episode of CSI: Los Angeles, at times endeavoring to be dark and edgy. But there's no vision. The jumpy editing makes even a thin story hard to follow. The weird score, which is all over the place with no cohesive atmosphere, doesn't help. By forty minutes, in, I had little idea what was even going on.While Denzel Washington does a decent job with what he's got, Remi Malek feels totally miscast. He looks like he always about to laugh. He's tiny and skinny and when he gets mad and hits things, it's funny. Jared Leto is the best thing about the acting, but despite his efforts to flesh out the bad guy, by the end his character felt like a cliche. (And getting to his part takes an hour, which is totally unnecessary, since it's one obvious clue which leads the cops to him and there are never any other suspects.)This is all part of the larger problem. Where have all the cowboys gone? I long for more films from auteurs like David Fincher, Spike Lee, Quentin Tarantino, Denis Villenueve. Unfortunately, they can only make just so many movies. We need more of them, but it feels like instead we're getting ""safe"" films from corporations. Gentler retreads of past films which then had vision and artistic courage - passion.In short, the reason The Little Things fails is because it doesn't succeed in making us care, probably because the people who were making it didn't either.",The Little Things

347,Tony_Fresh_Reviews,Freddie Mercury Hunts Down a Killer Queen,5,21 March 2021,"REVIEW: The Little ThingsThis movie felt like I was on a stakeout waiting for something to happen. It was such a slow burn that the flame completely went out. It spends most of its runtime on inconsequential filler, and with a powerhouse cast of Denzel, Rami, and Leto, it takes a special kind of movie to be this boring.But the cast held up their end of the bargain (mostly). This movie made me realize that Denzel's an old man now, but he's still got it. He had by far the most compelling character arc as a cop coming to grips with his past. As for Jared Leto, he brings in the creep factor. He had the kind of eyes that stared through you instead of at you.Then there's Rami Malek who basically had the same expression on his face the entire movie. He brought zero depth to his character besides crying and yelling. His character was bland, his performance was forgettable, and he just sucked at being a detective. Good thing Denzel's still got it though.The movie has its fair share of dark and disturbing themes, but it felt restrained. It felt like a long Criminal Minds episode. With all this star power, this movie never even came close to reaching its full potential. It was when all 3 of the boys were together did things begin to pick up, but this happened only once.With the slow burn nature of its narrative, the ending NEEDED to land, but it didn't. I get what they were trying to do, make you feel like the detectives, obsessively defeated, but it was just so unsatisfying. Let's waste 2 hours of your time and not even solve the case. And I get it, this is what ""real"" police work looks like, but that doesn't mean it makes for a good movie.Overall, everything in this movie was just average. The only thing that maybe elevates it enough for me to say it's fine is the cast (because Denzel's still got it).Score: 5 out of 10
Overall: AverageThanks for reading! 😄",The Little Things
348,rachelnstephens,"A list cast, forgettable movie",4,4 February 2021,"I finished watching this movie about 5 minutes ago, and honestly, the story is so forgettable.The story instantly sets off on the wrong foot when Denzel takes his personal vehicle to pick up evidence in LA, in the very beginning of the film. Cops don't use personal vehicles for work-related, out of town, errands.The final showdown again makes no sense. It would be incredibly easy for Remi's character to explain what happened with Jared Leto so... It just seems unnecessarily complicated to do what Remi does.With such an A list cast, I can't believe they wasted their budget on a lackluster, forgettable story.",The Little Things

One has to wonder if he was actually glancing offscreen toward the producers, just waiting for someone to march on to the hot set and inform him he's fired.

376,hakan_respect,a typical seial killer movie with a great cast,6,9 February 2021,"The little things directed by john lee Hancock and it has some stars casting including, Denzel Washington, Rami Malek and Jared Leto. when I saw the trailer of this movie for the first time, my expectations automatically increased because Wahshington's character looked like a badass character and leto's character seemed some kind of psychopat in the trailer. on the other hand, movie looked like another Seven movie because of its dark tone and storyline. Basically, Washington's character resembles with Freeman's character, Malek' s character with Pitt's character and leto's character with Spacey's character. The story in both movies involves two lawmen tries to catch a serial killer only difference is Seven has a style and more compelling characters and Seven has one of the best twists of all the time. let's turn back to Little Things, it has a great casting but very straightforward movie so it was little bit disappointing for me. Washington's performance was good as deputy sheriff Joe Decaon who tries to help a young officer to catch a serial killer. Although Washington was good in the role it was not one of his best performances but persistency of the character was conveyed to the auidence effectively. Although Malek's performance was okay, his character jim Baxter was not interesting character, his character was a cliché young kite character. I want to say that I dissapointed with Leto's character Sparma, I would have expected more psychopat character, he was not as I expected. Yes it was creepy, but it is not enough. Also, I think Leto needed more time to be able give a more competent performance. I think his screen time was short. Briefly, the movie was not quite original, it has a lot cliches and it is far from being another Seven.

382,taranpannu01,The Little Things (2021),6,20 February 2021,"The Little Things is a decent entry into the crime thriller genre. Elevated by a great performance from the ever divisive Jared Leto, the movie is a by the books procedural that should entertain the masses.I didn't expect much coming into this film, most of the crime thrillers that I knew I'd be subconsciously comparing it too were mostly television standouts such as Line of Duty, Unforgotten, Luther with of course Prisoners & Se7en.The film does not at any point ever reach the heights of any of the aforementioned films / programmes. But it is an entertaining watch probably best for a Saturday night on the tv.The writing is a little lacklustre, it isn't anything special it does what it says on the tin, if anything it is jumps between being too vague and too on the nose.On a technical level the film is decent. Shot very nicely, some jarring editing in really odd places as well as some sound issues regarding mumbling dialogue.The main standout though is Jared Leto. Denzel Washington & Rami Malek do their best but the film loses a lot of heat during the first half. The pan begins to boil again when Leto's Albert Sparma steps onto screen, he brings an energy and an enticing presence that just makes you watch his every move.

I really enjoyed the movie. Great acting and a good story if the confusion or vagueness left out. I had to rewind the movie to make sure of these points.
The ""nice boots"" mentioned then showed briefly on the bed of Deke implied he might be the killer but the beginning scene shows typical brown leather shoes worn by the serial killer. The first scene also shows a non-black man's wrist confirming it was not Deke. More could have been done to really wrap up the movie to make this a 8 or 9 out of 10 movie.

So far, it's the best yet.I'm a bit biased but when you know it's a Denzel film, 95% of the time it ought to be good! LOL. My expectations was somewhat close to 'Fallen' or 'Training day' but it's refreshingly and surprisingly darker.What stands the most in this story is you never who the killer is. A real psychological thriller! Jared Leto's character and performance is absolutely amazing, he's a better Joker psychopath here than the Suicide Squad. Mr. Robot is so so, there's not much expected to his rookie character anyway.Another part of the story is focusing on the wrong decisions of the detectives/police. All the detective films we seen have this stereo type that they always solves the case, a hero, makes the right decisions, etc. But in reality they are human. They also do the wrong ones. They are not perfect. Which makes this story relatable and realistic. And who better can play that charactet than Denzel!An instant classic in the psychological thriller genre!",The Little Things

Really wanted a well done killer v detective movie reminiscent of Se7en, zodiac, etc. The Little Things unfortunately did not deliver in the end.I will say that Denzel and Leto were excellent. For me, Leto played the part well. The type of killer character that can send chills. However, Malek, was a let down. He just didn't fit the role.This film was NOT boring as others are saying. It was mysterious, suspenseful at times, and really grabbed me in the first 2/3 of the film. The final 1/3 of the film (as soon as Malek's character gets in Letos car) nose dives. It is a decision that doesn't fit the character. The decisions get worse from there.It was so close to a great movie. In fact, changing a few ""little things"" would have elevated it a lot. I didn't even hate the ending, I just felt it was left open-ended to try to be ""different"".

396,josephbrewster-88279,An unpleasant experience in (mostly) all the right ways,8,7 February 2021,"This is a hard review to write because I can't say I liked this movie, but I don't think this movie was made to be liked, which is a testament to the effectiveness of the execution. It was well done, if unsatisfying, and plays on the anxiety and dizziness of ambiguity. It rides this anxiety into the credits, which may leave more than a few moviegoers feeling cheated of the tidy package they expected from a brooding crime drama.I went in knowing nothing except the cast, which is my preference, and was content to judge the film on against a blank slate of expectations. Denzel gave a subdued every-man performance with palpable sincerity. As Deacon, he commanded the screen in a quiet, repressed emotionality indicative of a seasoned actor. Malek was a suitable counterpart, mirroring a younger version of the weathered Deacon. The chemistry was ok between them, but the acting did feel flat and tedious at times, matching the doldrums of their stakeout and beat work. In terms of pacing, very little crime is on-screen. This is not the realm of heated car chases, shootouts or gut-wrenching murder scenes. Think CSI with added helpings of cafe dialogue and meaningful looks.Am I making It sound long and tiring? It is. Which wouldn't normally be how I'd describe a good movie, and yet this machine was built for a reason, and overall I think it does its job properly. It's built to make you question. Not just elementary whodunnit questions, but deep existential wrestling against the dark specter of the unknown-of uncertainty. After all, why are we drawn to mystery as a genre? Uncertainty is alluring and the thrill of the reveal brings a profound sense of satisfaction. The good guys triumph, the secret is made known, the disaster is averted. Here is where this film takes a sharp departure from the norm, and to its credit.As the plot rolled along, I felt the writers were stirring up more questions than the runtime would allow them to properly explore. We were handed two main characters, ostensibly noble, but internally conflicted. Driven by a sense of righteous duty, they relentlessly pursue the evil, even when it requires taking the law into their own hands (which, let's be real, pretty much every hero from Sherlock Holmes to James Bond does with shocking regularity). Their efforts should pay off. Their digging should unearth the truth. That's how reality should be. Neat, tidy, orderly and fair.And isn't that what we all want? The same as what these two obsessed detectives are risking their lives and sanity for: truth. Certainty. Closure. Is that so much to expect?It's a lot to expect, actually, and while you are right to expect star performances, unexpected turns, tense encounters and smoky interrogation room episodes, be careful about those expectations. We don't always get what we want. We don't always see the truth. The world doesn't always right itself of wrong.And so neither does this film. Nevertheless, it is a stirring commentary on how our obsession to know, to be right and to find closure can lead us into dark and dangerous territory where the odd serial killer may not be the greatest threat to our health and home.",The Little Things
397,harrishcraig,Could It Be Any Worse?,1,21 May 2021,This film was a mishap. Even worse than I anticipated after reading reviews.

This is a terrible movie.,The Little Things
398,adaringdo-1,More Leftist Propaganda infuses a non-existent crime drama,5,1 February 2021,"The story begins with murder. That's the hook. Denzel, a deputy sheriff from another county, ends up going to his old police station in L.A. to get some information for another case and gets sucked into an investigation related to a serial murder he couldn't solve five years earlier. He gets tangled up with the new investigator and together they blunder through the investigation never once getting any conclusive evidence against the killer.The acting was superb although the flow of action was choppy and at times unconvincing. The final act shows the two officers being very unprofessional, even mentally deranged, as they abandon all sense of police procedure.Denzel latches onto a suspect although there is no proof. The director tries to push the narrative that Denzel's guilt of messing up his first case gets the new police investigator so consumed with frustration that he murders the suspect, who is innocent of the crime. They hide the body and it turns out Denzel was also responsible for covering up another policeman's incompetency when five years earlier another innocent was killed.Basically this is a not so subliminal kick in the face to police and trumpets their incompetence. It locks onto the leftist dogma that law enforcement is petty, ineffectual, and angry enough to lash out at innocent victims (O.J. Simpson comes to mind or Rodney King). I'm surprised the officer wasn't shown kneeling on the neck of the innocent victim, who obviously had physical disabilities that would have prevented him from killing anyone. The suspect says as much just before he is killed.The director goes so far as to show the license plate of the suspect isn't the same as the killer's. He shows the killer walked without the defect the suspect had. The suspect was also shown as someone who followed police cases and even confessed to a murder he didn't commit eight years earlier due to his need for attention. He finally got the attention he so badly wanted.All and all this is another political diatribe (although it is more subtle than most) of leftist hatred of police, the guilty are really innocent, and justice will never be dealt out equitably.",The Little Things

Well let me tell you this you are not gonna see any thing happen. You see the aftermath of one murder. Well actually two murders. There is no action until the end of the movie where the supposed killer gets hit with a shovel and that's it it. when watching the film you're expecting some intense moments of possible murder or action.

With Jared Leto in prime creepy form, I would've been okay with Washington and Malek pursuing him in the ever cliche game of ""Cat and Mouse."" But to the film's credit, it pursued a different direction. But in the end, it lost its way and didn't know what it wanted to say. What could be said that hasn't been said before? The World is unjust and filled with bad people? Leto gives a tiny speech near the end (as the suspects always do), and in his speech he says nothing. I get what was trying to be said, it just wasn't fresh and the material nor the film's great actors could stick the landing. By the end of the film, the viewer is as lost as the writer was.

The story is ok, even though the lead up to the ending was dumb, and it had a real Seven feel about it particularly the last 20 minutes and in all honesty the writer may have pinched a little from Seven's ending. Not complaining though, I really enjoyed it. The acting was superb. Denzel, Rami and Jared all have very distinct styles and each shone in their particular role. The scene with Denzel where he was lying in bed having visions of the victims was top notch. You could feel his pain. And Rami's little breakdown felt genuine. Jared's character was creepy as hell. Seriously, if you were one of the supporting actors and you received a call from your agent telling you you had a part in a movie with Denzel, Rami and Jared, do you think a little pee might come out?

404,benjaminlauriesmith,I rated it 7 for a reason,7,1 February 2021,"I think if you have never seen the movie 7 then you will enjoy the ending a lot more. It's not that the ending of this movie is bad because it isn't and it's something I've never seen before and wasn't expecting. What I was expecting was a jaw dropping 7 esk type reveal and ending but we didnt get that. Then again if I wanted to see that shouldn't I just watch 7 again and if it had have ended like that it would most likely got slated for being a 7 copy.
I thougroughly enjoyed the movie right up to the ending which having thought about it is only disappointing because I'd built it up in my mind to be a 7 type movie ending which it wasn't and it wasn't the ending where Denzel arrives just in time to save his partner and it wasn't the ending where the baddie takes the cop by surprise and the gun goes off leaving you to wonder who's alive until the reveal but then they have all been done before and this is an ending I've never seen before but is it an ending I would have chosen given the choice? Well....No. Sometimes it's just nice to have another slice of cake, even though you know what it tastes like.The other problem with the movie is that it leaves you with a question about what the movie was actually about. Was it in fact a movie made in era of high tension with the police in the US about police corruption and the murder of an innocent man or was he and even if you decide upon that you are still left with the corruption issue.
The problem is that the main suspects guilt is ambiguous enough for you to question the motives and moral right or wrong of the cops. If this was a Dirty Harry movie you wouldn't even bat an eyelid at the ending, just cheer along as the cop who breaks the rules to get the bad guy gets it done again.
There are also numerous issues that spring up with the events of the ending. Getting in the car with the murder suspect and digging holes while he walks around you with you gun inches away from him?
A character that up to this point has been cool calm and collected breaks character after a single provedation and kills the suspect with a single swing of the shovel?
They then decide to commit a major felony with the possibility of getting caught when he simply says the suspect grabbed his gun and he swung the spade and hit him. There are no witnesses and all they need do is place the gun in his hand, after a brief investigation it's justifiable self defence and a lot easier to cover up than burying a body which could be found and taking the risk of cleaning an apartment and a car. The FBI are now carrying out an investigation in the area. It would also have fitted with the fact they covered up the earlier accidental killing.
So, the ending has issues and it's easy to see why people have been voting this lower than what you might expect.
It's not a 1 as some Muppets have been putting and it's not a 10 for most people. I think your expectations and past movie experience will determine how you rate the movie.
It does also lead to some interesting discussions about what the writer and director were aiming to bring to the screen. Is it a politically motivated agenda piece aimed at corruption in the police or is it a morally driven movie about the grey lines in life and what people are willing to live with.",The Little Things

I kept waiting for the clever twist that would reveal the identity of the serial killer, but by the end the only killers that are revealed are the two detectives themselves. Along the way there are distractions such as sloppy edits, faulty logic, and Jared Leto's facial prosthetic that really detract from the film. Also, I think it was a mistake to say it was October 1990 at the beginning of the first scene. The rest of the movie feels like it was present day. And with Denzel's gray hair and coming from his current job in Kern County to return to his old stomping grounds in LA and revisiting his past case, I spent most of the movie thinking that first scene was a flashback to several years ago. So then I was very confused when that girl from the first scene shows up at the police station when they have taken Jared Leto into custody, and she is the same age as in the first scene.

In hindsight, I don't think that was the intent of the director.

And I had to see the scene twice to confirm this. So yeah, spoiler alert. While it seems that Leto is the obvious killer, it's actually the Frederick (Stan Peters) who is most likely the killer. He had the biggest reaction when the name of one of his intended victims was mentioned. If you saw the movie, then you know that only 4 people would ever have such strong reaction and you get to see why. Also, the biting of the victims might indicate Stan as well because it was Joe who broke his jaw so this is kinda his way of saying: Hi Joe! The jogger who got kidnapped was never found and I guess it's because Stan had killed himself before he was able to dump the body in his usual M.O. Also, Leto seems to have a limp while the intended killer at beginning of the movie does not.

Deke was seeing the murder victims in his room and had conversations with them?! What was the significance of Deke hugging Jimmy and calling him boy?!

Rami feels a bit forced in the role. I just can't seem him as that straightman detective. Probably should've switched Letto and him, as I can see Letto doing a better job in that role, but I doubt he would have been interested in that.
But anyway, the crux of the problem with the movie is that the story leads to an unfulfilling end. You know there's some twist coming, because you can't not know with movies like this. You just don't know what the twist is going to be.

433,trav123,The big picture - is not to watch this dull story with a very predictable ending,5,2 February 2021,"This is one of those scripts that should have stayed in the closet back in the 90s as it really has not much to add to the genre and the ending is obvious and blase.
Thankfully the actors are top notch but even with Denzel, Rami and Jared this film had some potential in the 2nd act even though the editing is horrible but the 3rd act makes you realize it is predictable and an ending that leaves much desired.
If the writer wanted to show the dark side of a cops life and how frustrating it is to not find the real killer there are many other movies that do a better job and this one is far from entertaining even with these stellar actors. Yes spoiler... the guy was a psycho but not a killer and all the clues are easily revealed but you hope the writer is bringing in another hidden element like maybe it is Denzel or Rami. Instead you almost fall asleep like the cops watching the perp all night long like watching paint dry on a wall. If the A list actors were not in this movie it would be a terrible B movie that Roger Corman would be proud of instead it is the big picture that makes the little things matter so the script is worth making into a film. Better luck next time... and watch it with some coffee or red bull so you dont fall asleep as there is nothing really new to this old plot. It is no wonder that one of the reviews said nobody wanted to make this film back in the 90s.. as it is still not any good in 2021 almost 30 years later. And if you did not figure out the ending then you must have fallen asleep from the boredom.

I can deal with one or the other, but not both.Once things finally got rolling it was like they wanted to smash as much action into ten minutes as possible. For instance Denzel is cool as a cucumber through the majority of the film but loses it at the one time he shouldn't. So many things in the script just didn't add up.Leto was perfect as a creepy weirdo though. sometimes I think it may not even be an act. Guess that makes him a good actor?

Many others.Hurricane and American Gangster deliberately ignored major aspects of each of those guy's biographies resulting in a tainted depiction meaning lies. His portrayal was great.Equalizer is just ok. As were Pelham, Safe House, 2 Guns, Man on Fire, most of these movies would've been garbage without his immense talents. I believe he just doesn't demand or request better scripts or directors. Or something else I'm not aware of. Look at his career biography and see if I have a point.Malcolm X, A Soldier's Story, Fences, Mo Better Blues and others are great and better because of him.Of course it isn't an attack on him personally, I'll never meet him but I'm sure he's an outstanding gentleman, but have wondered this for years.There are a few other of the best actors I feel the same way about.

Even though it was not their best work, Denzel Washington and Rami Malek remain strong throughout. Honourable mention to Jared Leto's performance where I believe he should have been introduced much earlier. Approaching this film from his character's perspective rather than Denzel Washington's could have turned out to be a much more interesting result.

450,aequanimis,Cyclical in a bad way.,5,7 February 2021,"I saw the trailers for this movie and was actually looking forward to watching it as it seems like an interesting thriller revolving around detectives looking for a killer. Unfortunately, I was disappointed.This movie is very well-done in a lot of technical aspects. The soundtrack is involving, surreal and very fitting to the meticulous tail-chasing work that Deacon and Baxter have to do throughout the movie. When scenes were fast-paced, it worked well with the action on-screen to give a good sense of movement and adrenaline. The cinematography was wonderful and lead the audience's eyes to what it wanted you to focus on.However, this movie wants you to focus on ""the little things"" (like the headlines on a newspaper in the foreground or Sparma's car in the background) and doesn't really leave room for the audience to take notice of those things on their own. Instead, it hamfists it into your face such that you really can't ignore it, and believe it or not, that's not good storytelling. Deacon was supposedly a great detective who let a case overrun him, but that's really only said and not proven by anything else. Denzel Washington is a great actor, but for the most part, he seemed like a man who was bored out of his mind rather than tragically burdened. It's like the movie kept introducing elements that were all supposed to tie together at the end but didn't give them enough time to really sink into the audience, so it all just ended up seeming like random information that they were telling you is supposed to be important. And every time I saw a new element like that, I just thought, ""They're gonna show that again at the end."" And I was right.I left the movie feeling like there were some big themes that I was supposed to walk away with. Not because I actually feel like there are, but because it kept insisting that I should walk away with something. When a movie keeps telling you what you should feel, the result is an uninvolved and unfulfilling movie experience which is exactly what I got.The pacing of dialogue is, at times, atrocious and awkward. I felt like I was watching a movie set in some parallel universe where no one knew how to properly speak and all their sentences would just run together in some giant lump of conversation. It was basically impossible to watch this without subtitles. Also, what's the deal with the animosity between all the characters? Is this also a universe where everyone hates each other? Or is this was the director thinks ""police banter"" is?Denzel Washington and Rami Malek are good actors. Their performance in this is... not great, but acceptable. I think Jared Leto thinks he is good at playing mentally-ill, deranged characters, but he's not. His character, Sparma, was insufferably goofy from his mannerisms (like that weird limp walk?) to every line of dialogue that came out of his mouth.Overall, even the plot of this movie is unsatisfying. What's the message here? What did the characters learn? Time repeats itself, I guess, since Baxter ends up doing exactly what Deacon did. Or that being dedicated to a case is an excuse for sloppy detective work? I don't know.There's a lot that this movie could have done and did not do. My real rating is a 4.5/10.",The Little Things
451,nyxstrix,"Denzel Washington is the only actor we got, I reckon, who can get away with this stuff.",8,30 January 2021,"Waited so long to finally see this movie. I tried not to go into it with high hopes but it's impossible not to be hopeful with a cast like this (except Leto)
Unfortunately I was not surprised by what I saw. Over acting on Leto's part, jarring cuts, an overly repetitive score, underdeveloped characters and a MAJOR plot hole. The movie feels like it's trying to say so many things but it never quite reaches the mark.
The only positives were Denzel's acting (as the case usually is), a few memorable lines, and the parts where it tries to do what every crime thriller before it has already done.
Overall the film serves better as something to put on in the background, not something that deserves your full undivided attention.So disappointing to be completely honest. Huge Denzel fan, pretty sure I've seen every movie he's been in at LEAST three times and this by far is probably the worst movie he's appeared in. I had so high hopes knowing Denzel, Remi, AND Jared was apart of it. Three PHENOMENAL actors with amazing potential but it was executed poorly in my opinion. Honestly, I feel like the storyline was there and it COULD'VE been a great movie! The first 27 minutes was really intriguing and drew me in, wondering what the next move was. Then there was a little over an hour of what just felt like stalling and expecting something to happen but it just never really does. One of the worst parts though to me though is there are so many things that you expect to come back up in the end, hoping that you'll find an answer or some type of closure of why it doesn't really make sense starting out.. to just find out only two of those things make sense. Also, the ending. I definitely grasped the meaning of why it was done.. just felt like it was kind cheap to end it.",The Little Things

453,westerfieldreviews,The Meandering Murders,5,10 February 2021,"John Lee Hancock takes full control of his latest film as both writer and director to create a crime drama wrapped in a suspense thriller that is an unexciting project from beginning to end. The Little Things is a troubled film that places itself in a specific genre where some fantastic stories have been told, unfortunately, The Little Things has hardly anything dynamic to show or tell. Starring Denzel Washington, Rami Malek, and Jared Leto, everyone does a fine job in the role they are given, but ultimately, no one stands out amongst the cast to deliver a jaw-dropping performance. With a narrative penned by Hancock himself, the film fails to deliver anything that we as audiences have not already seen before. However, Hancock's approach behind the camera alongside Thomas Newman's thrilling original score with the aid of the entire sound department help bring a real atmosphere to the film that almost instantly bolsters your engagement as a viewer. Even still, failing to ""wow"" or excite at any moment, The Little Things stands as a film stuck in the crossroads where it is not outright awful, but also not exceptionally great; with no low marks and no high marks, it sits in a state of limbo as just another film that will be forgotten to time.The Little Things tells the story of a rampant serial killer who remains at large in Los Angeles during 1990. Sheriff Joe Deacon (Denzel Washington) of the Kern County police department is called down by his superiors to recover evidence pertaining to the recent murder of a young woman. Being sent down, Joe reunites with some of his old friends who are still working at the department. Along the way, he joins lead detective Jim Baxter (Rami Malek) who is currently investigating a new murder that has just sprung up. However, the old case was never settled and in the midst of a new one, the likelihood of discovering a suspect dwindles by the second. But, becoming consumed with the case, Joe begins to find similarities between the current day murders that have transpired and the old murders he investigated some time ago. With the seed of a potential lead, Joe and Jim go forth digging deeper into their investigation until they narrow down their search to Albert Sparma (Jared Leto). With Albert as the primary suspect, Joe and Jim continue to dig deeper into his mysterious life trying to find any tether to link him to the murders. All the while, questions of Joe's past get put forth as everyone begins to question and wonder just why he is so interested in cracking the case.Hancock developed and wrote the entire story found within The Little Things, and somehow with all of that control, nothing about it feels original or fresh. For starters, we must first investigate the characters found within this film. Having three academy award winners signed on for a project is no small feat, so naturally, you would aspire to utilize them in the best ways possible. Sadly, neither Washington, Malek, or Leto are fully applied. This stems not from their performances as everyone does an adequate job portraying their characters; no, this is a problem directly tied to the material they must deliver. Hardly any development is dolled out to any of their characters with no growth, no change, and no reflection. The central themes of the narrative lend themselves perfectly to this kind of traumatic development but none of it ever happens. Having character problems also leads to a severance of any emotional resonance that was supposed to be had. Throughout the entirety of the film not once did I truly care for what was to come down the line towards our central characters because the film gave me no reason to. Hancock throws in small details like both Joe and Jim having children, but when it is never visualized to the audience how a case like this may hit home for them, how can we be expected to care. At times it feels as though that the film never wanted your vested interest because, for a suspense thriller, it relies on many of the same tired tropes we have seen before while offering nothing new to counteract any of it. To make matters worse, The Little Things has a runtime of roughly a little over two hours, so as a result of its cookie-cutter storyline, you feel every last second of its 127-minute duration. The film goes through its motions getting from point A to point B slowly building to a reveal of some kind. Unfortunately, just when the threads of the plot are beginning to converge and the story is coming to a head, it sluggishly begins deflating itself ultimately wasting any hidden potential the film could have had.Regretfully, I surprisingly have nothing left to say about this film. Given what The Little Things could have offered, it is a tremendous let down to witness the final result. Hancock taking complete control over the project from start to finish could have been a curse in disguise simply because he does nothing engaging to pull you in off or on the camera. The job of captivating the audience is left to Newman and the sound department as eerie moments are drastically more immersive due to their contributions in building a tense and unsettling atmosphere. Sadly, Hancock's writing does not elicit that same response. Barring a few moments of character banter between the cast, none of it feels all that enticing. Naturally, the issue of writing also extends to the titular characters of this piece. Assembling an all-star cast of Denzel Washington, Rami Malek, and Jared Leto, you would expect the bar for this film to be extremely high; sadly it is not. Each actor embodies the troubled mind of the person they play but with no internal struggles or explorations of the damaged spirit, it feels vacuous. The Little Things exists as a film that is perfectly tolerable which in this day and age is not the space you want to occupy considering all of the available options. Because it is not offensively bad or remarkably good, it will easily be forgotten until you check back on everything you saw this year and after quickly passing the title and briefly remembering it, you will promptly forget about it seconds later.Final Verdict: C-",The Little Things
454,SimonsRants,"Better than people say, not as good as it could have been.",7,3 February 2021,"The Little Things - 7/10The little things obviously took a lot of inspiration from other films; everybody points out that it was inspired by David Fincher's Se7en but I was equally reminded of Nolan's Insomnia as well. That being said, that does not mean that this film doesn't have anything new to offer. Although it does follow some familiar tropes and storylines, it still is original enough to offer something new. Added to that is some fantastic acting from all three leads.Most of the time when you have multiple great actors all vying for an Oscar nomination in a single movie it leads to some dramatic overacting, in this case all three performances are subtle, subdued, understated yet still brilliant. The mystery in this film is fairly obvious, the trailer shows you everything you need to know. But with that in mind, the mystery wasn't really the focal point of this story in my opinion. The focus rather was on the characters and their development and about who they are as characters. In my mind the characters are written very well, not that they're perfect but they're good.I think there was some sloppy editing, sloppy writing, and inconsistent directing but nothing worthy of a 54% that they've received from Metacritic. I'm not saying it's the next big classic film or anything like that, no not at all. But I think that this film fully deserves a seven that I've given it.

In that sense the film is a bit haunting, as it should be.I found the end to be immensely satisfying. Apparently not a popular opinion, but Deake (Denzel), who is a good man, decides to help vindicate Jimmy (Malek) by slipping him a bit of peace of mind. Even though it was a lie, he didn't want Jimmy to be haunted because Deake saw so much of himself in him.I think the closing scene with Mary and the Autopsy shows that someone did something somewhat like that for him, and it may have been the most kindhearted thing anyone did for him.... so he passed it on and did in kind, but went one step further and in a way made Jimmy feel vindicated.My only gripe with the film is what happens when the bodies start to pile up again.

Sounded unmissable - and sure it stayed that way for me. It definitely draws inspiration from Se7en to a degree and fits in nicely to the time its supposed to be set. It feels like a 90s kind of thriller.The acting is great - but this is to be expected from three oscar winners. To me the trailer made Maleks character seem like a rookie - the new kid on the block shall we say - but that certainly isnt the case. He is confident and assured and i thought he did a very good job in this role. Denzel is also good but at times he feels like a backseat character. Leto, again is creepy as we have seen regularly in his roles over the past few years. His character is the most interesting and he isnt your one dimensional antagonist - Hes funny and sarcastic and Leto was a lot of fun to watch. He keeps you guessing.However, the plot itself bring the most impirtant part of the film is quite stale and you are left unsatisfied. I appreciate Hancock went for a different kind of ending that filmgoers may not expect - does it work? I'm not so sure. Maybe theres a bigger message here but a film that starting off as gripping and tense deserved a better conclusion.Overall, some great acting and the cinematography is beautiful at times.

It seems to have taken for granted that the viewer could follow the story line. I could not....what was the backstory about Denzel's story shooting the girl coming thru the bushes? It could have been a much better story if the editing and story telling were in sync. I mean I watched it but I didn't get much out of it.

The story and some of the scenes and dialogues reminded me of 'Seven'. Here too we have a young detective and an experienced detective. But while 'Seven' is very direct and visceral, 'The Little Things' is more psychological and real. It focuses more on the feelings and how one individual deals with choices in life, trauma and guilt.

481,denuwan-27382,Forgettable story with Unforgettable Cast,6,30 January 2021,"The Little Things written and directed by John Lee Hancock. Deke (Denzel Washington), a burnt-out Kern County, CA deputy sheriff teams up with Baxter (Rami Malek), a crack LASD detective, to nab a serial killer. Deke's nose for the ""little things"" proves eerily accurate, but his willingness to circumvent the rules embroils Baxter in a soul-shattering dilemma. Meanwhile, Deke must wrestle with a dark secret from his past.
First I have to say this movie separates being GOOD from OK is Performance of the cast. Otherwise, this movie is easily forgettable. The best thing about this movie is Denzel Washington. He gives us an unforgettable performance as Deke. His character is hunted by previous mudder cases. He is psychologically melted down and Denzel Washington gives what exactly the character needs. He really looks like a person who dragging the past. I think Rami Malek as Baxter is miscast. It's not Rami Malek's performance he does not like this character. Maybe I saw him perfume too many times not being normal but that's not the only explanation other than the last act of the movie Baxter not doing anything at all. Jared Leto as Albert Sparma this character is creepy as hell and mysterious. We don't know that he is the real killer or not. Leto put Deke and Baxter tough position they can't decide is he the guy or not. This is a slow-burning mystery and the mystery not good. There are no high points so I feel really flat about the plot. The script should be improved. Good cinematography with meaningful colors tones. One time Deke in his apartment looking at pictures of victims the color tone is green, this color tone presents sickness and we know mentally sick he is. I do not strongly recommend this movie but with this cast and performance, you should give it a try.",The Little Things

The script isn't that enjoyable but by the help of those actors And a great director who understands what it takes to reach to the movie point and idea, so it's a very well crafted project.
In the first half of the movie I thought that it's a remaking for the movie ""se7en"", as it seemed that we have the same structure And characters, also it's another movie that shows the story of detectives trying to solve a case of a serial killer. So I was thinking that if this movie wouldn't introduce another different special thing that makes my watch worth, I would be very disappointed. And yes it did meet my expectation and satisfied me.
The writing of our story is written with Mysterious words and this method is used to save the attention of the people that are watching, as They become curious to know what those words mean or refer to. As I said the director was trying to keep the attention either with good acting specifically from Jared letto who'd did a great job giving us confusing vibes and legendary stuff or also by a dialogue.
Also, the score used here grabbed my attention and made me wait for it, it's so soothing and relieving as if it's saying "" now you are relieved, try to solve this case with us"" and by progression it's becoming disturbing as our heroes are also disturbed,
All of those elements kept the movie alive till we reached the end that we all waited for and also the director """" was trying to reach it with less damage, and here I mean by the damage that he was afraid that the people would see it boring or repetitive movie.**********spoilers************This movie puts a new observation for mystery and crime movies which is something I really appreciate.
The movie carries a lot of meanings, a lot of emotions, and they are undercovered.
It won't end with the same usual problem-solved ending, as if movies that show crime and mystery are missing this thing, of course your case might not be solved, this is very realistic.
It's about conscientiousness that kept chasing ""denzel"" throughout the whole movie, his desire and his insistence to find this killer who put him in a position where he killed a woman unintentionally. So we seed from the beginning of the movie that he is the one that's trying harder to solve it, relieve his conscientiousness and destroy that thing that kept chasing him and devastated his whole life.Also mercy that he gave to ""Rami"" when When he committed a mistake like his mistake, that he feels what he feels and will feel, that feeling that lived with him throughout his life and sent to him a Convicting evidence which used to search for, that would make him live his life normally.

Didn't fit the scenes i was watching. Would've been better with zero background score.Some unnecessary scenes like Denzel with the ex wife.The ending ruined it for me. Could've been so much better. Would've been much better if after Rami got the go ahead from Denzel to accept the cover up at the end, that we (and Rami) discover that Denzel the whole time was the murderer, Rami puts two and two together with the constant Denzel chewing gum and connect it to the 'mouthwash product' found at one of the crime scenes. We then realise the girl Denzel accidentily shot, he had to because she knew Denzel was the murderer, and have the red barrette thing turn out to be a set up by Rami to capture Denzel.

The story soon begins to plod and nothing of any real substance happens for the first full hour after an initial crime scene sequence delivers promise that is frustratingly unfulfilled thereafter!The second half of the flick focuses on the cat-and-mouse game between our three leads, but again it's all slow and uneventful with little excitement setting up a wholly unsatisfying final act which stretches both credibility and viewer patience. So disappointing considering the acting talent on offer and only Leto truly shines, with an obvious character study drawn from Charles Manson. Denzil is solid as ever yet unspectacular, but it's Mr Mercury (Malek) who falls as flat as his one dimensional facial expression, despite plenty of screen time.In summation 'The Little Things' wholly misses the mark and despite some initial promise, it's nowhere near the level of classics of the genre like Se7en, Silence of the Lambs, Badlands or American Psycho.

This was slower and more depressing than I expected. I don't need a lot of big explosions or car chases, but it's still slow. It's the type of movie that frustrates the audience on purpose. I was looking for a Friday night date movie. I was expecting a good detective film, thriller, or mystery. This was none of those for me. This is more of a character piece on how good people can get frustrated by their jobs and that working really hard and sacrificing your joy and your family might be for nothing anyway, but then again maybe it's not for nothing so you should probably keep doing it just in case.
So it's a decent movie if you like slower character films that make you think and are kind of a bummer. If you worked hard all week and finally get a chance to relax with your person on Friday night and were hoping to enjoy a detective movie - don't pick this one.",The Little Things

It jumps around too much and thrusts you into scenes that you're not even sure why you're there. Is Denzel's character (Deke) someone I should care about? I don't know. They don't even develope him before we're already thrown into the dark crime arc of the movie.Deke parks his car weird, blocks in cars from leaving and walks into the Sheriff's station as if he doesn't care. He goes into the evidence department to pick up what he wanted, then proceeds back to the parking lot because (I assume) he's leaving. This is where we meet Rami Malek's character, Detective Baxter. Baxter is having Deke's vehicle towed because Deke boxed him in from leaving. The very next scene, they're both inexplicably back in the building. Wait, weren't they both just leaving? You're having someone's vehicle towed because they boxed you in, but you weren't actually going anywhere?Stuff like this just becomes annoying. Everything else seems to be done well, but not a 9/10 or even an 8/10. At the time of this review, the movie has a rating of 6.7. That's fair.",The Little Things

Anytime you think something's gonna happen it doesn't and the movie just goes slower and slower with the pacing. If the ending of the movie was satisfying I'd rate this higher, but it was completely nonsensical from the prior buildups.

And here, as in most of his films, Denzel is a 10! I disagree, wholeheartedly, with some of these reviews which state it's a run-of-the-mill detective story. Not at all! I admit that I was hoping it would go further into the mind of a killer, and give us the creepy killer scare factor. And as the movie progressed, I could see it was not going to go there. But I was okay with it, because I bought into to where it was headed.The fact that the movie doesn't go further down the gore, creepy road, is exactly what was desired here and needed to deliver a whodunit in disguise. This road created a more cerebral movie. These cops believe they have the killer the whole time, and we believe they have the killer as well. The ending twist was good and the final ending was touching. Which leaves you wondering if the killer was actually caught - exactly what the writer was hoping for.2 points removed, because of a scene where Rami's character does something so removed from what a detective or cop would do, you will go into ""no-way"" mode. Also, because I don't think Rami plays a convincing detective. Whereas, Leto, I feel could play a detective much better. Give Leto a haircut, a suit, and he could play the role. Rami, on the other hand, would have been really good playing Leto's character. Malek's creep factor is on the surface moreso than Leto's. Its a solid 8 out of 10.",The Little Things

My contention is that these two cops are made to start behaving like the infamous Keystone Kops in order to advance the points the director/writer is trying to make, which BTW is completely in line with H'wood's political/social mindset.The first point is that cops are not just incompetent. They are stupid to boot. Deacon breaks into Sparma's apartment after they have tried to lure Sparma away and then ends up crawling on the roof trying to keep from getting caught when Sparma turns the tables on him. Even if the characters have not noticed, we in the audience have long since realized that Sparma is way smarter than these cops are. Then we have Baxter getting into Sparma's car to be taken into the wilderness to dig holes where there is nothing to find. What kind of idiot cop would do that? Only a Keystone Kop, not one in real life.The second point here is that cops are corrupt. They protect their own from the legal consequences of their incompetent or stupid, but deadly, mistakes. These two cops kill people, one innocent and one probably innocent, and they get away with it, with the collusion of two other corrupt members of law enforcement.It is a very dark and depressing tale this.

542,stepperwalsh,"Expected more, a lot more",6,2 February 2021,"The Little Things begins like a classic cop thriller from the late 80s, early 90s. A girl is stalked by a dark figure. It's a scene of shadows and footsteps and an ominous sense of danger; the type of opening that makes you buckle up in anticipation of a roller-coaster whodunit. Except..., The Little Things doesn't quiet deliver on what it promises.Set 1990, Denzel Washington plays Joe Deacon, an LA cop banished to a dusty township and haunted by a serial killer he never caught. On a trip to his old stomping, however, a murder occurs that bears all the hallmarks of his old case . It's not long before he's sucked back into the investigation. Jimmy Baxter (Rami Malekis ) is the new detective assigned to the killing and the two form a reluctant partnership.The first hour is enjoyable as they piece together evidence and trace leads. With no computers or cellphones, this is all done by knocking on doors and searching trash. Soon they zero in on the killer, Albert Sparma (Jared Leto) a man who seems to get his kicks from taunting police.Once the killer is in their sights, though, all momentum is goes out the window. We go from stake out to stake out and the two men make one bad decision after another. At one point they invite the killer for a beer to distract him so they can break into his house. It all seems so amateurish. But the most frustrating thing about his movie is the all the tension is concentrated on the beginning and the last ten minutes, leaving the middle sagging woefully.It's directed by John Lee Hancock, an director with an impressive resume (The Rookie ,The Blind Side, Saving Mr. Banks). With him at the helm I expect a bit more. The ending was rushed and didn't provide any rewards or resolution.",The Little Things

It also hinted at a desire on the part of the older cop to remediate an error in his past by covering for what could be career-ending errors on the part of the younger cop.
That's what I thought I was getting. What I got was a tedious, confusing, implausible and frankly, not very interesting crime drama that seemed to waste every opportunity it was given. And when one of the viewing partners says, ""Is he (the character played by a miscast Malek) the dumbest cop in the world or is this just a crap screenplay?"" I knew that I was't the only one who was disappointed with the film.
There is only one upside to the film, and that's Denzel Washington. IMHO, he is the only actor who is a bona fide movie star, an actor who is worth watching in anything, who never gives less than a compelling performance and who elevates every scene he's in.

You can watch this with your grandmammy or grandpappy and not feel awkward.My only complaint is Rami Malek being 90 pounds soaking wet and still being an LA Detective.

Yeah there's some broad similarities as far as geography and the character dynamics but this movie tells it's own uniquely grim story and comes to its own conclusion. Se7en was good but it was more an experience than a statement. Never open head-sized boxes? Psychopathic serial killers tend to kill people? Always take your wife's call? It was a mystery that just ended awfully for everyone involved. Which is fine but aside from the police/killer dynamic they're mostly dissimilar.I found all the performances well done and satisfying. I kept wanting to know a bit more and feeling some vague frustration but that was the goal. I think we all get caught up in our reactions: just breviary I'm not enjoying myself at the moment giants mean anything is ""wrong."" Who said were all supposed to like everything? Fun easy movies are out there if you want them. This film certainly doesn't present itself as fun or easy, jams you up mentally I believe to help you empathize with the police investigating. It's not about solving murders as much as what's happening in the headspace of the police trying to solve them. This isn't about a crazy murderer, it's about what their awful acts do to the people charged with stopping them, and what it takes (from you) to try.Performances were all excellent. I have an unjustified visceral dislike of Jared Leto, perhaps due to sharing the name, but he did a great job as the primary weirdo and is well suited to portaying a greasy perverted Jesus with a beer belly. His walk was a bit much maybe but that's all. Denzel was awesome as he generally always is. Not quite so many Denzel tics as usual. Rami Is another actor I don't generally like but he's young and it takes some time to get more diverse roles. He did a great job with a more straight-laced grounded character. No bad performances I noticed.Okay, the spoilers such as they are. It occurred to me the red barrette might've been bought. As I don't try to figure this stuff out maybe that's really obvious. Also maybe I'm dumb or too tired but I don't know wtf is in that tackle box at the end. Something from the third victim of first case I'm thinking. Guess I'll try and find out (when I pause it dims my screen so I can't really examine). The bullet would fit but didn't look right. Regardless, whether that was some unknown object or something I should've recognized it didn't detract from the experience.Someone mentioned it was unrealistic the digging cop would turn his back on Leto. I'm okay assuming he was thinking hard and tired and also it added suspense. Getting in the car was a risky move but he knew that. He had to go solo per Sparma's demands. It was an underrated performance though: his emotions were usually wrapped up tight until he'd pop. I think he was indecisive but also stalling to give his partner time to see then leave and follow.I did find the past/""first"" case and what all went down confusing. Seems like the third victim was still alive? Odd serial killer wouldn't finish the job. Then again it was stated the bodies were still warm/just happened so maybe the killer had to flee before finishing her off? Can't blame her for not yelling ""help"" if you think some stabby psycho is still in the woods with you.
I mention my confusion and perceived flaws not to criticize the film but to demonstrate that I could like it regardless. Some movies have flaws we get hung up on. A quality movie can overcome all that. Needing to know whodunnit misses the point here. It struck me as a study in ethics, closure, the intrinsic value of truth, whether it's subjective or whether that even matters. I don't think Sparma did it but you're not supposed to know. You may think you want to but if you did you'd be on here complaining how rote it was instead. It's been proven you can't make everyone happy anymore.Good movie. Much more satisfying than Netflix stretched out TV episode movies for sure. I had trouble pausing it and I usually don't. Watch it on its own for what it is. Comparing it to other crime movies or the actors other performances is a disservice. I generally dislike two of the leads and still liked it. Therefore I think it's probably good. Give Denzel some credit too, when's the last time he took a crappy part? I've been seeing more movies with actual costars rather than extras to prop up the big lead.I guess I needed to see some bad reviews but it's been growing on me more and more since I watched it. Two opposable thumbs up(I can't imagine how younger people can watch moves from/set in the 20th century anymore. I spent over half my life with normal house phones and then cutting edge pager technology. So I can still sorta downshift my brain back to all that but newer generations are uniquely unable to relate to a world without instant communication. I don't know if I could really get it never having dealt with a busy signal. Good luck. I knew the 80's would feel old but I didn't really expect ""primitive"" so soon)",The Little Things

The only good thing about the movie was Denzel. I understand why a 67 years old Denzel might accept such scripts. He's almost old now and needs some money to retire. But why Rami and Jared? Remember they are all Oscar winners. I was expecting more from Jared, since it was a very much wanted comeback.The last 2min of the movie were the only good thing about the story.

And as he raises his hands in the air, we see the found wealth drop from his hands and fly into the void. It sits poorly with viewers that might root for certain comeuppance for truly bad guys and possibly some forgiveness for good deeds. I suppose he didn't die, but in the end, the black thief is going back to jail, destined to serve a longer sentence than the crime justifies because of his prior record. Not even the magic of movies could rescue the story from some of the social tragedies of our time.Then there was this movie. It also had notable acting and thoughtful camera angles - nothing on the level of Fincher's tremendous camera storytelling found in Panic Room. Here, the viewer is taken on a journey of possible redemption for a man dedicated to serving his community, who lost his personal life because of this dedication. Denzel's old detective sees himself in Rami Malek's young hotshot detective; and the two begin an unlikely friendship as they thwart procedure in order to solve the case and possibly bury past ghosts. They do not solve the case and instead bury a suspect that might not have done it. This was Panic Room all over again. No one got what he deserved: not the killer, not the detectives, not the parents of the missing girl. And similarly, this film only reinforced a negative stereotype found in today's reality: #ACAB .Panic Room is a much more redeemable and enjoyable movie, but I was reminded of it tonight when in the end, we were again left with a dead Jared Leto and a big blank ""meh!"" in place of where a moral of the story belonged.",The Little Things

He's a crime follower serial killers don't have Police radios. you also see the book Helter Skelter for the first time in Albert's apartment then again at the end when Deke is burning everything.4 when Albert tells Jim where to dig and then goes oh no maybe it's over here or over there. Serial killers remember exactly where they bury their victims this is been proven. Many come back days later dig them up just to relive the crime.You see Jim at the end has dug many holes in the area finding nothing.5 the obvious one is one Deke sends the red hair clip the jim but actually purchased it.6 in the hidden box under the floor there is not one personal item including no red hair clip from any of the victims. Serial killers are synonymous for keeping personal items as it lets them keep reliving the murders.7 Albert knew they were breaking into his apartment as you see when he goes to the bar he automatically picks up the phone and calls officer down at the location of his apartment why would he let police into his apartment if he had evidence there.8 another big clue is that the end find out that Deke actually killed one of the victims by mistake when they found the bodies of the two girls on the rocks years ago.This is why he knows he has to cover up the murder for Jim so he has to never know that he killed the wrong person that he doesn't go through the mental anguish that he did.9 the victim that survived only identifies Albert from police photos because she happened to see him in the hallway hand cuffed when she went to the washroom.10 another huge clue Jim turns his back to Albert when he's digging and you clearly see that is gun is right there sticking out like a sore thumb on his hip Albert could have grabbed it no problem.,The Little Things

It had a pace that pleased me, with no fireworks and heavy weapons, things that frankly I have outgrown. (I hope that doesn't sound snobbish. It's simply true. The case is, I'm old enough to be pleased with characters more than fast action and chases.)I can't help but feel that the film moved into somewhat surrealist territory with the closing minutes. To have the detective digging all those holes reminded me of the kind of play Samuel Beckett would stage. It cannot be considered literally, but symbolically. To take the detective's actions literally would lead one to poke awful fun at the film (as many have.) Granted, it's a bit off putting as one is not prepared well for this elevation---if you will---to a different reality, but one should have faith in the director's vision.The film poses many questions. ""What would you have done?"" seems to be the most pressing and unsettling. That uneasy feeling one gets at the very close should not be ignored.

I didn't fee that way when this one ended. Yes, it made its point: a detective working a murder case can become obsessed; it's the burden of responsibility, seeking justice, retribution, vengeance-choose your word-for the victim. And the point of the story is the old proverb: ""Before you set out on a journey of revenge, dig two graves"" (or something like that).

Still, his performance remains memorable, even if his lines do not.The film starts strong, with an engaging setup: a serial killer who once eluded Denzel Washington's character returns, offering the old cop a chance at redemption. He shows up at his old precinct, unwelcome, and meets a young hothead who is on the case. Sounds like a fun cat and mouse buddy cop thriller, right? This is not that kind of movie. The movie focuses entirely on character development, and the actual plot takes a back seat until it finally fizzles out in an unengaging finale that probably looked a lot more clever on paper than it does in the final film. Yes, I got the message and I understand the themes, but just because something is unconventional, doesn't mean it's good. This isn't No Country for Old Men, where the themes are so strong, that they can carry the movie beyond the confines of standard story structure.The second half also suffers from pacing issues and plot threads that go nowhere (ex wife), which only serves to heighten the disappointment after the initial good impression. Imagine going to a nice restaurant. The decor is lovely, a friendly waiter brings you to the best seat in the house, highly recommends today's special and after a fantastic appetizer, your mouth waters at the prospect of the main dish.

It's a good crime movie that misses the mark by a lot. You've seen all this done better somewhere else. Throughout the movie I wasn't sure what the movie is trying to state. It tries to do a lot of things, trying to tel us a lot of things, and never doing either properly and completely.The performances were OK, not your Denzel, not your Rami, and Jared's acting is really unnatural. I wouldn't give away the plot, but there's not a lot to this movie, no reason why Jared does what he does, no real reason why Denzel or Rami feel what they feel, so it really feels very hard to correlate to either, it isn't even a solid slow build up thriller.The story and direction are all over the place, somethings are never explained.

So much so, she decides to get out of the car at a closed gas station/diner, while further up the road in the background you can see lights of a town. And instead of running back to her car she runs out in the fields to return later to the road further on where she happens on a truck passing by. Perfect start of a lame ass scary movie.Then it seems okay for a while, with Denzel Washington doing his thing as Joe Deacon. But you'll find something isn't right, in the little things, like the title says. And you'll start realizing the movie isn't going to be a very good one.The movie is carried by some, and others are done over the top, like the woman Joe needs to talk to for boots in LA.Rami as the smart rookie replacement of Joe, acts like a creepy robot, and my first thought was that he's gotta be the killer, but probably too obvious.Then we meet an even creepier weirdo, played by Jared Leto. He's supposedly the real killer. At least he tries so hard you'll start wondering why he isn't in jail already. Clearly the guy isn't right in the head, you can see that a mile off. But the rookie doesn't see it until Joe points it out.Leaps of logic would be a better name for the movie. Joe wants to check the weirdo's house, so the rookie calls the weirdo to say he's sorry for taking him in for questioning and that he likes to make it up by meeting at te local bar, just so Joe can check his apartment. Then the rookie decides not to meet and leave the guy hanging in the bar so he can honk the car if he returns. Really?! Of course this plan goes to hell.The next day they're staking out the weirdo's house, clearly visible. Their logic is to just let him know they're there. Obvioulsy he isn't gonna do anything if he knows you're there!Later that evening the rookie can't stay awake and his buddy Joe goes out to get a watch battery. LOL. So the sleepy rookie can fall asleep and get murdered by the weirdo. Oh sorry, got a little carried away there, that didn't happen. No, instead the weirdo calls a public phone, conveniently placed near their car, because he knows the rookie is now all allone and he wants to hang out or something. Rookie goes haywire when he suddenly sees him standing there and start shouting his lungs out ""hands in the air!"" and all that other nonsense. Buddy, chill out, you can see his empty hands. He's just teasing you because he knows you guys are there. Remember? You talked about that earlier.Then after they chat a little the rookie decides to go with the weirdo to see the missing girl he kidnapped. He doesn't wait for Joe to return because the empty handed weirdo calls the shots. Then they ride of just as Joe returns with coffees so he can follow them. Blegh. At least the weirdo drives a cool car.While on the road the weirdo says, ""You know, you're not really good company."" then ""You know, you and I are a lot alike. In another lifetime... uh, we could be friends. Isn't that crazy?"" Yes, it is crazy... crazy writing!

But it didn't affect my opinion of the movie at all.The plot and ending, to me, was straight forward and good. Denzel's character was a great detective, he became obsessed with a case he couldn't solve, and it caused him to eff up. He happens upon a new case with same MO, and it's a chance to nail the killer. Ramy effs up too, Denzel helps him ""deal with it.""I think that the writers, editors, and director did their best to insinuate that Leto's character, was indeed the killer... even though there may never have been enough forensic evidence to hold up in court.The ending did leave me thinking... and after thinking about it, I was quite satisfied.",The Little Things

You'll see a body here and there . Rami Malek ....you can't understand a word he says and his acting is so one dimensional and boring. When Jared Leto comes in he somewhat saves the day with his acting...he's amazing....but the movie continues to drag on and really go no where. Anti-climatic ....poorly written and directed....and quite frankly just stupid.,The Little Things

It was tense and kept me interested from start to finish. I think some of the lower reviews are probably looking for something a little more modern but this movie is set in the 90s while at the same time feeling as if it was made in the style of movies from the 90s. I really liked this about it. While having its share of twists, none of them were overly sensational and there wasn't an over infusion of action and gore. Just a slow burn crime suspense with an unexpected but ultimately satisfying ending.",The Little Things
680,skeletornumber70,Good performances and a few unique twists make up for mediocre pacing,8,30 January 2021,"Let me begin by saying that I can see why this was a January release, even before the HBO deal. This is is the type of film that isn't mainstream enough to appeal to mass audiences, nor is it socially conscious enough to draw praise and attention from professional critics. Plain and simple, it's a pulpy slow burn detective story, so much so that I was surprised to learn it wasn't based on an existing crime novel. There really isn't much to say about the plot without giving spoilers other than a seasoned and psychologically scarred veteran cop returns to duty to help a young hotshot detective solve a case involving a serial killer. Yes, the same type of story you've seen a thousand times, and honestly for the first third of the film it seems to be just another solid attempt at the age old trope. Somewhere around the time that Jared Leto's character comes into play, you get a sense that something is going to be different than you expect, as the obvious conclusions of where it's going begin to seem too obvious. After that, the audience is treated to a string of twists, some slightly predictable and others pretty original. I found the overall storyline decent, but it has severe pacing issues, especially toward the beginning, where what is supposed to feel like a slow burn drifts more into wheel spinning territory. But this movie lives and does on its performances, and that's what truly elevates it above an average crime film. Denzel steals the show, there's no doubt about it, as he plays the older, wiser, yet still unhinged and dangerous part that he has perfected. Rami Malek is good too, but he has the unenviable role of being the ""straight man"" between Denzel and the astoundingly creepy Leto, who gives one of his best performances in years as a character who keeps you guessing on whether or not he's a truly demented monster or just an average creepy guy who is too into true crime stories. To be honest, it's the type of movie where you can just watch the trailer and know whether or not it's for you, so if it looked at all intriguing, I recommend as a good way to spend two hours.",The Little Things

I picked up more on my 2nd viewing and the ending leaves you guessing, but to me that's one of the things that made this a great movie.

The Little Things offers up a taste of the old school with its simple but effective plot that doesn't pretend to be anything that its not. The acting and dialogue is intelligent, subtle and effective. Denzel Washington, Rami Malek and Jared Leto all bring to the table a absorbing, masterful and truthful performances that really help bring a sense of long forgotten class to the movie.The sub-plot that explores the past events of Washington's character for me felt a little off but was well explained as it subtly drifts in and out of the movie as more and more is added leading to it tying nicely together with the main plot. I personally loved the 90's Jagged Edge style twist at the end that although isn't earth shattering its fun and commendable.The Little Things is a gripping and subtly tense movie that serves us commendable performances and a very well done simple but intelligent good guy vs bad guy plot.Solid Entertainment and here's me thinking they don't make them like that anymore but after watching The Little Things.....I'm glad to see they do!",The Little Things
688,prbessette,Better the second time,9,20 June 2021,"I read through these reviews and wonder if people writing them paid attention to their own brain noise than the dialogue. The comment about the dog? Denzel said before he ever left to the dog, don't blame me, 'I'm not the one who wandered off for two weeks' expository information to let you know that the dog does have other haunts and you don't need to worry about him when D. Doesn't return right away. And they've had people being chased on dark lonely stretches of road try to lose the follower by getting off the road and try to get help plenty of times, usually a set up for a murder scene which was expected and didn't happen so her actions are questionable by one reviewer instead of wondering why they planned that scene to be exactly as it was. Again, they needed the one that got away in their back pocket for later in the movie to ID Jared, it's far more interesting that she's no good as a witness because due to a quick trip to the washroom she sees him being brought in for questioning. It was done this way to highlight the rules of police work. They honestly don't have money or time to make useless scenes in movies, or lines that you ignore. They quickly dealt with any concerns for the dog and established an eye witness in an early scene that most movie goers would have thought would end another way. I've said in reviews of movies like Momento, Tenet, Inception, etc. Any with complex plots just pay attention! That's all they're asking, you're questions were answered if you simply paid attention to the dialogue and plot points that ALL matter. Also, I find it amusing that in some comments it would seem the writer thinks the actor's actions are thought up themselves rather than following a script. That scene where the girl pulls into a possibly open public place for help? We don't know we're going to be facing an ambiguous ending at this point, and that action on her part is the audience's first and only chance to see the actual murderer, to pay close attention to the walk, body, build, clothes, etc to actually have for later to compare to the possible murderer they later believe is the killer, and I'll just say, if you took note of those things earlier? It's far less ambiguous in the end.Remi Malik left us with a very unexpected reaction to Denzel's last pat on the back, that's my boy moment? It was as if a light went off in his mind, I think his mumbling right after was to address that reaction and accept what he'd done and he was going to have to accept how sometimes police work might involve making the evidence or actions fit the crime, not the other way round. Denzel had been left with the girl he accidentally took for the perp and in the end, Remi is seen ruminating about the last girl he desperately wanted to find that night to justify his actions as much as prove beyond a doubt that regardless of how, he got his man. Well acted and a bit choppy disclosing Denzel's past in the editing, but not horrible. If you like a good slightly type of noir movie and these actors in particular it's free with your movie channel subscription now and I've watched it three times, you see more every time, one viewing leads to snap decisions and reviews demanding answers that the movie clearly gave if you'd only been watching and listening more carefully.",The Little Things

696,JJace99,"The ending will make you think, even if unsatisfying.",8,30 January 2021,"This movie is great, without Denzel, Rami & Jared this movie would've probably been less good. The story dives into a realistic murder case or better said cases. There's a serial killer, and who is it?
The twist is, we've seen it all before, and we haven't fully seen this. Reminds you of ""Se7en"" in ways and in other ways it doesn't.
You won't be happy with the ending, because you want to know who the killer is, but you simply don't know. Which in real life happens as well, some killers aren't caught and psychopaths can leave no trail behind.
Could it be Deacon? Maybe. But most likely not, even though he first mentions ""the little things get you caught"" as a hero phrase, later it's used as a anti-hero phrase. Making you think ""could he have done it?"". No, he refers mostly to him having killed someone and there was evidence, but it got covered up and never mentioned again.
Could it be Albert? Maybe. In ways, he looked very smart and could've easily gotten rid of all the evidence. He could've simply been the ""weirdo"" and it being someone we've never even seen on screen. But it's not a definite no to the question ""was it him?"". It's not because we know Deacon bought the red barrette, that it means Albert is off the hook.
But do I think it was Albert? Probably not.
The movie tries to tell that not everything can be dealt with, figured out. Not everyone gets caught. On top when you get to obsessive, you make mistakes you can't get back. Deacon killed an innocent girl, Baxter might've killed an innocent man. It lets you know that even the best fail and even the best aren't always the best, because others get away as well.
""The little things tear you apart, the little things get you caught.""
This phrase is for everybody, be it a small secret, a big secret, you mention it, you do something suspicious, and you get asked questions and could get caught. You bring old wounds back to life.
The movie has great acting with a storyline that for some could be thought on like me and makes it an amazing movie, for others it'll give you an unsatisfying ending and will be the most average movie, since you've watched 2 hours of a suspenseful movie with no real ending.",The Little Things

The ambiguity still has me wanting to watch it again to see if there's anything I missed the first time through.Interested in how the possibility of the killer striking again after the events of this movie were never brought up. I could see Detective Baxter going completely off the rails. Maybe I missed something.The shots really irritated me at certain points as well.

720,cameronthorne,No Redemption,3,1 February 2021,"The Little Things trailer looked great - a modern Se7en, I had thought. After much anticipation, the movie dropped and was getting extremely poor reviews. I did not think that could be possible, three Oscar winners and a cool looking story given that bad of reviews? I eventually watched it and those reviews are very understanding.The last quarter of the movie is not the thing that makes ""The Little Things"" so awful. It is absolutely everything. Interestingly, it tries to get a new kind of reaction from the audience and the experimentation was respectable. However, it was a misfire. It makes the movie unnecessary, wasting two hours of the audiences time without any pleasure or feeling of worth. Waiting for something to happen but it never does...Writing is a key aspect in film making, and with bad writing you are bound to have a bad movie. There were cool ""trailer lines"" ever now and then but they were nothing but trailer lines. A movie can still be watchable aesthetically with bad writing. But ""The Little Things"" fails in that aspect as well. Jumpy transitions that cause confusions is only a part of the garbage editing. It feels like some scenes were cut off half-way. Additionally, the cinematography brought nothing to the table, it was all very generic.The acting is the only thing that almost saves this movie. Jared Leto and Denzel Washington were pretty good - however far from their greatest performances. Unfortunately Rami Malek's talent was lost with the lack of chemistry shown on-screen.The Little Things is not a good movie. There are no redeemable qualities for this film.

What a shame. Lazy, lazy, lazy.",The Little Things

728,natehamilton-79324,"I really wanted to like this movie, but was underwhelmed. Good acting however.",6,28 February 2021,"I was pretty excited hearing about this movie. I enjoy this category of film and think that Denzel Washington does this style well. I think that this genre is rarely done successfully in today's film world so I had high hopes for this. I also love rami malek, and the acting in the movie was good. However, I felt that this movie didn't live up to expectations and felt like it tried to fit in a lot but just seemed unfinished and not very detailed at points. The movie seems to try and lay groundwork for the first 1/3 of the film but to me it seems unsuccessful and rushed, even for a 2 hour movie.This movie has characters that have a fair amount of screen time, yet do nothing. Much of the movie seems pointless. One thing I did not appreciate was things would be briefly touched on in the movie and then never brought up or explained again. The movie also does a rather poor job of explaining the past of the story and little is known about the serial killer other than how he does his crime. Although I suppose that is the point. I think that after you watch this movie, you might feel the way I did, which was pretty indifferent. I wanted to like the movie and it does some things pretty well. But for the cast and expectations it fails in many places to me.",The Little Things
729,DelaRed,if Denzel wasn't the lead . it would go straight to cable Tv-movie .,3,29 January 2021,"Yeah on paper the movie looks good .3 oscar winning actors and a good director but the translation to the screen it's just plain awful .The acting was below the standard of these actors . The only standout among the 3
was Denzel who gave a good performance but nothing special or challenging about his character which we have seen in dozen movies before . while the supporting cast were absolutely dreadful .Jared who played the weird and creepy repairman tried his best to be Kevin Spacey in 7 but failed miserabaly to the point when he became laughable but at least he made some effort and i give him the credit for that and oh boy here we come to the least convincing or i must say ( totally miscast) Rami Malek . he did no effort to bring his character to life . bland ; 0 emotion and 0 presence on the screen .Bring a 4th grade actor and he would have done a better job than he did or just get rid of his character and you will miss nothing .and for the script . well nothing original or creative about it . just take the best hints of some Fincher crafted thrillers ( Se7en- Zodiac - Mindhunter ) .Throw them into the mix with one of the most banal and frustrating endings to date . with characters doing illogical decisions to drive the plot forward and you will get what's all the movie about .
I must say that i enjoyed the captivating cinematography by John Schwartzman which brought the vibes of the 1990s and the score by Thomas Newman which was right on the target . but all of these elements went up in the smoke due to the lack of originality and cliched writing .
All in all . Despite the talented cast the movie had nothing new to add to this genre . if you expect a gritty crime thriller with captivating characters and masterful storytelling you will be disppointed .",The Little Things
730,RamseyReviews1,Well Done Crime Movie With Excellent Cast,7,5 February 2021,"I really enjoyed this movie. Thought the cast was excellent. Denzel Washington playing a cop is a role he's used to and perfect for. Thought Rami Malek was an excellent co-star. Jared Letto brought a nonchalant creepy doobie brothers vibe to the antagonist role. Supporting cast was all rock solid as well.About ex Los Angles Detective Joe Deacon (Denzel Washington) who returns to the city to investigate the murder of a young women by a serial killer that resembles that of another case that went unsolved during his detective days. Working the case now is his replacement, Jim Baxter (Rami Malek). Pressured to solve the case and finally put this serial killer behind bars,, Baxter looks to Deacon for help.Besides the cast, I liked the mystery behind Joe Deacon's past life as a detective and slowly figuring out through the use of flashbacks why it is his life unraveled, quit his job, got divorced and moved out of Los Angles. Deacon's past literately haunts him throughout the film. As the movie progresses, you can see the mirror images between Deacon's character and Joe Baxter's. It is like Deacon is re-living his life right though his replacement, Baxter's eyes. Right down to the same unsolved murder of a young women.The scenes with Jared Letto in them are great. He really does a great job portraying a rag tag serial killer who just loves to screw with the police. He was fun to watch and brought a good energy to the movie.That sense of mystery starts right from the beginning, as the movie opens with a car chase between the killer and his soon to be victim. I was thoroughly hooked from the beginning through the end as the drama of the situation escalates. That said I will point out that the flashbacks could have been executed clearer. I found myself a tad confused at times as they were unfolding. There was also a lot of just sitting in a car doing nothing as Deacon and Baxter performed not so covert stake outs while tracking the whereabouts of their suspect. I still found the scenes to be good but I can see how some may be bored of them after while. Not much action at all in this film.I think if you enjoy crime movies you'll like this one quite a bit. I found the main draw of the movie to be less about the killer and more about the weight and mental exhaustion a homicide detective puts on their own shoulders while trying to solve a case like this. These cases change their lives forever and they feel personally responsible for bringing justice to them and their families. They wear this responsibility like an anchor around their necks.The Little Things is well worth your time. Excellent cast. Good storytelling .Plenty of mystery. More realistic then most detective movies.",The Little Things

I'm figuring they must have lost a bet to be in this movie or there were a lot of numbers on their paycheck. We have seen this movie plot before but done much better.And has anyone but me noticed that Denzel plays ""Denzel"" in most of his movies? Different settings and character names, yes. But he doesn't really stretch past his persona; cool, smart, Alpha. What would have made this movie a little more interesting would be to switch up the typecasting:
Denzel as the serial killer;-Jared as the straight-laced cop Detective with a nice middle-class family;
Rami as the troubled cop; (maybe give him a bad history of a drug or alcohol abuse problem).See, doesn't that sound like a more interesting movie?
And that would have have really demonstrated that these are ""great"" actors if they were able to pull it off and make it believable.
So, yes, it is ""the little things"" like this that could have made this a better movie.Spoiler:
And last but not least, I spent a great deal of time at the beginning of this movie trying to understand why, in the first 3 minutes of the movie, a woman who is being chased in her car, would stop her car, get out, run into an open field, and then flag down another stranger in a truck to basically hitchhike to get away from a presumed killer chasing her? ....Huh??

743,avelrodriguez98,"Like the main characters, you should pay attention to the little things.",8,31 January 2021,"I am amazed at how much I can pay attention to the films I'm watching and pick up on the
details that make up the central theme. I'm not gonna pretend like I'm the most knowledgable,
but I am going to give my POV on what I think this movie is trying to say.I'll start with Deacon (Denzel Washington) who has a reputation in Los Angeles, recognized
noticably by Baxter (Rami Malek) who is a rookie detective. So the two of them begin
collaberating on a case involving murdered female victims by a sadistic man.In a bar, Baxter raises the question, and I'm paraphrasing, ""Why do cops obsess on a case
they are working on well beyond 5+ years while everyone else has moved on??"" Deacon
could've continued on the case longer, but the crimes stopped when the culprit moved
to another town. Outside his jurisdiction and into someone else's.One understanding is that you should never obsess over a case. Move on. The other side
of that is that if you obsess and play the sick games of the culprit, you might wind up
making a fatal mistake. Deacon accidentally kills a missing victim who startled him in the
woods, and Baxter kills Sparma (Jared Leto) who was annoying the heck out of him.
That is why it would be much easier to move on. I'm explain why that is in the confines
of this story in a bit.But yeah, move on and don't stoop to the level of a criminal to solve a crime. When dealing with
a sick man like Sparma, you move on or risk letting him get to you with his minds games, and you
make a fatal mistake.It's a tough pill to swallow.Moving on would've been easier in this story for one main reason. Sparma is a crime enthusiast. He meets Baxter and says he is a fan of his work. Basically, Sparma is the type of guy who would watch Law & Order, and take notes. The culprit in each episode is caught because of the details he or she missed that the police detectives catch on to. As Deacon puts it, ""The Little Things"".It's because of that reason that Sparma who basically mastered the act of covering up his tracks, so much so that connecting evidence to him is 100% impossible that he gets away with his crimes; and I do think
that Sparma is 100% the culprit for that reason.Evidence is conclusive. Sparma owning a CB radio means nothing. At one point, Baxter has forced Sparma
to take him to the body of a missing person's case. DOA. Supposedly buried out in the middle of nowhere.
Baxter has allowed himself to be sucked into Sparma's mind games. Which is why Baxter kills him with the shovel.Sparma is calm the whole time because since he is really good at paying attention to the Little Details in his crimes, he has no need for killing Baxter, and he knows Baxter is not going to find anything anyways, and tomorrow he's gonna go back to work. He even says that, as I paraphrase, ""Can we get this over with. I got work tomorrow.""Deacon who followed Sparma and Baxter to ""the scene of the crime"" sees what Baxter did and helps him cover it up while desposing of the evidence. Because of their built relationship, Deacon sees that Baxter will become like him in the future if he continues to obsess. Deacon knows that Baxter will be haunted by the innocent victims he let down. Just like Deacon in his own weird way.If I'm right, I don't think it was all for nothing, and I'm sure it'll show in the future anyways if the killings stop. I do think Sparma was the culprit, there was just no evidence tying him to the crimes.In the end, it is safe to assume that Baxter does move on. Again, this is just my baseline understanding. I do think some threads are thrown away, or not touched on much. Like the young girl in the prologue who reappears again much later and is just gone again soon after.If you pick up on those details if I'm on to something, you might be fascinated by this movie quitel like
I was.",The Little Things

He lacks screen presence. He exudes no power, and does not display it the entire film even when the script calls for it. Even his physical presence can only be described as ematiated, not usually typical of his role for good reason.Denzel is as per usual good, but I believe
the writing (Plot focus) was not much to work with. Pet Peeve include officers in charge of a crime scenes letting fellow officers on scene roam around touching things and snack from the fridge. The forensic scenes are a travesty, minus the coroner, who tries to lend credibility. Jared Leto...let's just say his performance is predictable. The end is sadly disappointing. With Rami who is supposed to weigh a conscience, flat again.The ending, the plot, a flat performance by Rami, and you have yourself a mediocre Denzel film.My hopes were high, but I still give it six stars for Denzel and the subject matter.

Denzel was great as a one heralded detective now working in a podunk town. He brought the depth I was looking for in Rami's work. Leto's performance was creepy and drew me into his character but the little rambling he did at times was, in my opinion, superfluous and distracting to what he he build with the character at the beginning.

775,nilbog777,Snoozefest with zero resolution,2,1 February 2021,"This is a movie that feels like it's 4 hours long. Despite the star studded cast, it manages to be terrible somehow. Rami Malek's and Denzel Washington's characters are cliche and poorly written. Leto's performance is the only reason this gets two stars instead of one. Characters in the movie behave inexplicably and seem to have no common sense. Even with level of obsession or fear that is supposed to be portrayed, they make head scratching choices for a film that is supposed to be gritty and noir. That starts from the very first scene when the target pulls her car off the road into a dark, closed gas station while she is being chased. There is zero motivation for someone to do that. At least write that she ran out of gas or popped a tire or something believable. Then, again later in the movie when the trained star detective, Jimmy, gets in the car with the suspect, leaving his partner behind, to see where the missing girl is. No trained detective would willingly behave like that. It's groan inducing. Then you get zero resolution at the end of the film. None. I know they intended it to be about obsession, but throw the audience a bone. They are vested for two hours of time and deserve to know what happened to the murderer. Frustrating, disappointing and pointless movie.",The Little Things
776,unclediss,"Woof, no wonder it took so long for this move to get made.",3,30 January 2021,"During these troubling times, the world is obviously starved for quality entertainment but 'The Little Things' is certainly not that. I am an HBO subscriber, so I totally could have watched this on HBO Max for no additional charge at home, but I really wanted to support my local theater and go see something new yesterday. Glad I only ended up wasting $8.This movie is so heavily flawed and full of lackluster performances I don't know where to begin, but let's start with flavor of the month, Rami Malek. This guy is overrated like a mutha. Every time he's on the screen, it's so obvious that there's a man trying to convince the world that he deserved that Oscar. Truly great actors effortlessly disappear into a role, but not Malek. Every bug-eyed decision he made was questionable and transparent. It was actually painful to watch and I'm now bummed out that he's the next Bond villain. And poor Denzel who has been phoning it in lately, most likely due to a lack of quality roles being offered. He looks just as bored as the audience is while sleep walking through this snoozefest. And then there's Leto, who is also struggling to convince us that he's an award-worthy actor. Granted, he was great in 'Dallas Buyer's Club', but ever since then his choices have been suspect. Just because you attach a nose prosthetic and change the way you walk slightly, doesn't mean you're method. I guess that's the curse of being told you're the best at what you do any given year. Think Halle Berry's choices post 'Monster's Ball'.The story is totally paint by numbers and so heavily flawed, while it tries to summon that impending doom so masterfully created in thrillers like 'Seven' or 'The Pledge', but never succeeds. No wonder it took the writer/director a couple decades to get this film made and it's not a surprise that folks like Spielberg and Eastwood backed out from making this movie. 'The Little Things' offers nothing new or clever to the genre and it actually made me laugh aloud a couple times, while sitting in the theater at how ridiculous it was.Oh well, I've wasted enough time griping about this poorly written, poorly acted and poorly directed thriller. Like I said, I was happy to support my local theater but I honestly have nothing positive to say about this movie. It's a stinker and a reminder that boasting how many Oscar winners are in your film doesn't mean jack do-doo these days. That's my word!",The Little Things

It's not the worst movie in the world but it's not good. With illusions and ambition towards Fincher's best, it so clearly demonstrates what is, and is not, Fincher. Maybe Fincher could have done it better, but the plot is so bland, it's doubtful. True to the current tread to disavow ambiguity, the good are good, and the bad are bad... millennials love this, no thinking required. Hampered by bad direction and odd editing, the story jerks and stops it's way though a tale that ultimately is devoid of interest and has little point. The actors are fine, and Leto is good and reasonably creepy, but plods along with a pair of cops that do just about everything that would never actually transpire in a real investigation. It ends after plodding scene to scene for two hours with a conclusion that is neither satisfying nor as interesting as it believes. They even alluded to Seven at one point when Leto references Maleks family in a disturbing way, leading me to think we may end up with a head wrapped in kale... but no, just another pointless tidbit, like the opening scenes which also make little sense and even out of character for the killer, if it's really him. I originally rated it 5 for just not being a great movie, but the more I thought about what it wanted to be, and the talent within, and the total blandness of the effort, I became more annoyed and dropped it to a 4.

The idea behind the story that justice is limited when it comes to evidence and how the law system works , there can be a killer on hands and you can't convict him with a murder just for lack of evidence and sometimes you will have to be the killer to reach that justice, Jared Leto is an example of that , the story gives you all the hints do the detective work to link all points pointing towards him as the killer but nothing they can do to prove that .

What an achievement. Every last story element is borrowed from other films and Hollywood cliches then poorly executed to boot. Every moment that almost does achieve its goal of compelling storytelling is robbed by the films bubbly 90s-inspirational-baseball-movie theme music. The colors are ""joyful, happy,"" like you're watching a cable television crime series - though not even the likes of Law & Order or CSI, but, rather... Monk. This film is, at best, an unoriginal ""diet"" version of Fincher's Se7en. Hancock had narrowly succeeded, at times, in creating decent Hallmark Channel-worthy inspirational dramas.

I believe the ending made the audience feel the frustration, the let down, the anxiety, all the emotions that the characters were feeling we as an audience felt as well.

And the detective have his knots in a bout, and it seem to play mind games on him that he can't find the killer even with the other cop out of town helping out.So in a rat race where their suspect was practical rubbing on out and pulling their tails, the detective snaps and kills his only suspect.Oh well.. The out town cop comes in, fixes everything and makes the detective feel assured that he was right, and this is where we as an audience finds out ""Mr. out of town"" actually killed someone too. So he sympathies. Alot. Concerningly alot.So I have a theory. I'm lead me to believe that he was the serial killer. It the way he has his breakdowns, talk to the dead, and comfort an unjustified murderer. And he was just obsessed with the case from the very beginning for no good reason. He doesn't even look into homicides where he's from. He murdering for the first time and getting away with it, probably set him off. And the way he makes the dead suspect ""disappear"".

819,msvillager,"Could have been amazing, but poor writing and execution left it DOA",3,20 July 2021,"I love the premise, and the point that this movie is trying to make. It pokes fun at all of the movies of this same genre, that have come before it, that all wrap up so neat and tidy in an average of 2 hours with a concrete black and white conclusion.Well, the reality is that most police work is nothing like the movies, and in most instances, with cases like the ones represented by this movie, where the criminal is clearly much, much smarter than the cops, then that usually means tons of frustration, dead ends, innocent suspects who are wrongly convicted (some perhaps even executed on death row), and horrible mistakes (including ones that require dirty cover ups). This could have been an amazing movie about that reality, where we are made to feel the same gut-wrenching and palpably real dissatisfaction of an unsolved case, that so many people in law enforcement have felt.Unfortunately, what we have is not that movie. We are left instead with the dissatisfaction of lazy writing, horrible editing, and amateurish direction.1. Lazy writing. So much of the plot is furthered along by elements that defy logic and common sense. The opening scene is beyond ridiculous, and is basically a textbook example of what not to do in such a circumstance. A car approaches aggressively, passes and stops ahead of you, and you speed up and pass it? Then you pull over and leave the safety of your vehicle at a gas station/restaurant that is clearly closed. The digging scene towards the end is also a head scratcher, and it's preceded by an equally nonsensical decision made by a seasoned detective to get into a suspect's vehicle (one that he hasn't searched for weapons). Opening the gate, and putting himself in danger of the car being used as a weapon. Agreeing so easily to dig the holes, rendering him distracted, and physically incapable of effectively wielding and using his weapon if attacked, and there's even a scene where Malik's character has both hands on the shovel, and Leto's character gets close enough to reach for, and grab his weapon. There's just so much of this lazy, weak, asinine plot advancing writing throughout the movie. The examples given are just the tip of the iceberg.2. Horrible editing. See the other reviews which have pointed this out effectively and clearly.3. Just the fact that some reviews mention that Malik's acting isn't that great, and you've got a total of three Oscar winning actors, and they still can't carry the movie. Well, that usually means poor direction, and of course see #1. Some of the scenes that are meant to be melodramatic, intense, profound are downright comical and laughable at just how bad they are executed. B movie level stuff.",The Little Things

This is one of those films that I truly wanted to LOVE.I'll list my PROS & CONS, to include the positives and negatives that I may have overlooked in a more general review.
CONS:Not very original storyline, too much copied from David Fincher's ""Sev7en"", or Denzel's ""Training Day"" (both of which included the ""retiring-cop-teaching-new-rookie-the-ropes"" theme). It was a challenge to convert my mindset to the PRE-smart phone technology of the early '90's, which made the instant communication factor non-existent. Of course that is no one's fault, just frustrating, lol. I guess if the story took place currently, it would have been a completely different plot.Too much jumpy editing from scene to scene.Too much focus on Sparma being the sole killer, not including any other tentative perps.Flashback overkill to inform the viewer how deeply Denzel's unsolved murders were haunting him. It seems they disrupted most scenes where he was alone. We get it, we get it, he's traumatized by his past of unsolved murders and his accidental killing of the female victim.Big plot hole with Jimmy trusting Sparma by turning his back on him while digging the holes. Actually, trusting Sparma enough to get into his car in the first place is not believable, especially with Jimmy believing Sparma was the killer. It was out of his character to make himself that vulnerable.On a technical note, I could not hear some of the dialogue no matter how high I added volume...like the characters were mumbling or speaking too fast. It must be a technical issue that was not intentional.Could have been 30 mins. shorter to tell the exact same story.
PROSStory was interesting enough to keep me guessing about Sparma's involvement in the murders.Denzel buying the red barrette for Jimmy (sneakily) to help him with closure and maybe lessen Jimmy's guilt. That was a clever and unique plot device, imho.Unlike other viewers, I don't feel that Jared Leto was overacting. His creepy character was convincing to me.I'll add more points to my review later if I think of any.",The Little Things

Amazing, top-notch acting from the whole cast, that's what makes or breaks a movie. Jared was key in knocking this out of the park, what a character!I fell in love with the soundtrack, not only the great classic pop songs, but the original score. Amazing composing from Thomas Newman. It's got everything I like in a great movie. Interesting and cool because it's a detective movie. Great acting.

The interesting thing about this film is that it's kind of slow throughout, but kept my attention where this two hour movie felt like it was 30 minute long. I believe this was because the character development throughout was so good. The casting and acting were phenomenal. This movie will not spoon feed you everything so some things are going to be open to your interpretation. I believe the intent of this movie is to help remind you to pay attention to the little things in your life and let the past die with the past. Don't hold onto past mistakes.

What does Stan Peters have to do with her and Denzel?
The ending doesn't say who the killer is. It's all about following the obvious suspect with no evidence. One scene I didn't like is when Jimmy (Rami) rode in Sparma's (Jared) car without informing his partner Deke. Why not follow him in your own car? C'mon, suspected serial killer and you follow his instructions and play his game? What's the point of Sparma bringing Jimmy to the desert to taunt him (a police detective!)? It's like he had a death wish. Well, Jimmy did accidentally kill Sparma with a shovel.

848,Loptimus06,The Little Things Review,7,2 February 2021,"While The Little Things may not be anything of much memoria, it still has a substantially good amount of worth as a piece of psychologically thrilling entertainment. The film shares much of its familiarity with the 1995 movie Se7en. Directed by John Lee Hancock, The Little Things follows two cops, Joe Deacon (Denzel Washington), a cop haunted by his past and cases he could not solve, and Jim Baxter (Rami Malek) as they investigate a chain of murders in 1990's Los Angeles and increasingly fixate their attention on Albert Sparma (Jared Leto) a suspect who seems to enjoy their attention. It's only by around the end of the first hour that Jared Leto's character Albert Sparma is brought into the picture. Throughout the runtime, the film insists that it's the little things that are important and conveys a theme that everybody has skeletons in their closet. The opening credits of the movie also introduces a new Warner Bros logo animation.The performances in the movie are nothing too memorable but are still good. With a cast led by notable Academy Award winners Denzel Washington, Rami Malek, and Jared Leto. The performances are supported by the script written by John Lee Hancock. The story of the movie is good and with turns at almost every corner it is another area in which the film has success. Although at its loss, the story leaves some areas of the film concealed from the audience. The Little Things will leave you at the edge of your seat in the film's most thrilling parts. The ending shifts from audience expectations and into a different structure than other films of the same genre and type.The score of the film composed by Thomas Newman is great and however does not assist in giving much of a thrilling aspect alongside the film's already existent thrill that is primarily occurrent in the opening and the ending. At the end of the movie, the score does assist with the thrill shown on screen. The lighting helps to set the ambiance of the film's 1990's Los Angeles setting with many dim and dark lights. These elements keep the tone fitting for the genre of a Drama, Crime, Thriller film.Overall, The story of the film explores many areas of the film and to its loss, leaves many areas of the film undisclosed. The score is great but does not give much in terms of a thrill. The performances in the film are also good, but they are nothing too special or memorable. These elements help to keep the thrilling storytelling and entertainment aspect of the movie at a somewhat large quality, there is nothing that is of amazing quality. I would rate this movie a 7.5/10. The Little Things is available to watch on HBO Max with a subscription from January 29th to February 28th and is also available to watch in theaters.",The Little Things

His walk, the prosthetics, and delayed speech with comedy show his trade craft and leave the viewers feeling just as the director wants. Rami Malek is getting a lot of hate.

Was an innocent person killed in the process?Deacon knows the hell of that uncertainty, and has spent his life trying to survive it, not being successful in this quest. He lost his wife, his two daughters, his home, and his functional quality of life.In Baxter, Deacon sees himself, years earlier. Deacon's life, as far as he is concerned, has no value in the present. He is unable to escape his past.Seeing Baxter with his wife and two young daughters, he doesn't want a second man and family to live thr same hell he has been living. Therefore, he puts what is left of his soul on the line protecting that, which he had and lost, for another.Even in its fallacious reasoning by both men, it's a sign of protective, paternal feelings for a non-blood child.Atonement, Deacon's way.",The Little Things

I thoroughly enjoyed the film. Brilliant casting, goes without saying, especially Denzel and Jared, they have nailed their roles with ease and perfection. Rami looked a bit out of the place in some scenes, he's an outstanding actor though.The plot justifies the slow pace of the film, with more focus on Denzel's character. It gets you hooked, but don't expect it to be an edge-of-your-seat thriller. It takes its time to unpack the series of homicides, and unlike many Hollywood detective thrillers, it's not black & white. It reminded me of Memories of Murder to some extent. Script could have been a bit more strong.All in all, it's a good watch for the fans of crime thrillers, and especially for the fans of Jared Leto and Denzel Washington.Cheers!",The Little Things

2. Cop is just digging all these holes while suspect is standing around, a lot of the time behind him, so suspect could grab his gun in the blink of an eye.
3. His partner when noticing he is gone... just happens to be able to find them out in the middle of nowhere?The writing just completely went off the rails at the end.

909,adamboykin,The Little Things Review,6,30 January 2021,"Did someone say Se7en? Oh they did good cause it is all over this film. The Little Things draws painfully obvious inspiration from Se7en which was directed by David Fincher and staring Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman. The Little Things stars Denzel Washington, Rami Malek, and Jared Leto.Let me start off with the things that I didn't like or thought it could use some work. The glaring similarities to Se7en aside the editing and cuts from each shot in this move are insane. In the beginning of the film it feels like I am going back and forth a thousand times almost to the point of making you dizzy. The pacing in this film is very weird because it never really seems to slow down. It is 2 hour and 8 minutes film that feels like it is an hour and a half and not in a good way. The film is very fast and it makes the dialogue go by very fast as well. It is an attempt to be like Aaron Sorkin dialogue but fails pretty bad. Rami Malek is a great actor but every line and action he does in the movie feels so forced and it makes me not interested in his character at all.All that to say the saving grace for this film is Denzel Washington and Jared Leto. Denzel continues to show us that he is one of the greats by delivering a compelling performance. Jared Leto really gives a creepy and intense performance with his character as well. Without these two performances the movie would not even be watchable. The other thing that was enjoyable about this movie was the story was good and interesting. Yes there are a lot of similarities to Se7en but aside from that the story does interest you and gets you invested. Overall the film is pretty decent and if you want to see classic Denzel then you should definitely watch other than that if you want a better film very similar to this then you should watch Se7en.",The Little Things

May be the only thing who saved the movie from being a recipe of disaster was Denzel's performance which was delightful and fun to watch.
Negatives
Rami Malek is totally miscast and he was bland and enengaging .Jared Leto gave a hammy performance as the creepy guy with his annoying voice which he used in the Rlade Runner 2049 .The characters are one - dimensional and have no depth.The movie was slow to the point when i felt bored to death .The movie started to get absurd the moment Leto showed up and just become a cat- mouse chase between the cops and the suspect.The movie lacks originality ( the opening scene when the young woman was haunted by the motorist and told her to pull off ""Zodiac"" - The interrogation scene "" Mindhunter "" - the desert scene ( se7en ) ) the writer added nothing new to this genre to be honest .The ending was just flat and unimaginative .All in all .

Rami Malek has always been a great actor to me, but in this film, he seemed a little stiff, I understand that was his characters choice and it ultimately led to the final climax of killing Sparma, but I would have liked to see a little bit of character development and not just this super uptight man the entire time. However, I will say that as a young actor to be able to stand up against Denzel and hold the screen and the attention of the audience, is something that is very commendable. So, This movie had me on the edge of my seat and anxiety high as I struggled to figure out how everything connected in this film and THAT is the type of film that we have all been waiting for. I loved the way that they waited until the very end to connect it all together, my favorite point in the entire movie was the final thirty seconds SPOILER ALERT!!! The fact that Deke brought the red hair piece just so that his ""partner"" wouldn't have to live with the guilt of killing an innocent man was what this entire movie was about. I think that what the writers did with this story line was great and again, the ay that the movie didn't really come together until the final moments of the film really intrigued me.

The little things in this movie are what allow a killer to be caught, but in reality it's the little things that make a movie great, mediocre or bad....... I believe this was a distinctly average movie.
The wealth of talent on offer in this film was overwhelming, but somehow the film stuttered along like a rusted car. Leto was excellent and gave the film an edge but Rami Malek was horribly miscast....... his presence was that of a weak kitten trying to portray a seasoned detective; it's down to 'the little things' - at one point he held a gun like an 80 year old woman.

953,millsonreels,Acting is Great. Story and Plot....Meh.,6,3 February 2021,Denzel and Rami deliver in this somewhat thought provoking crime drama. Denzel wears this role like he was born to play it. The challenge is that this film does not contain anything that we haven't seen before. It's an almost-SE7EN script that lacks the depth and complexity that will have you revisiting it and thinking about it for years to come. Given the limitations of the plot they did what they could but the emotional weight does not carry over throughout the film and leaves you wanting more and not in the good way.,The Little Things

Here we have a detective who accidentally kills an innocent girl, and because of that, he gets traumatized, has a heart attack, and goes back to being a regular cop.

967,bettypopp,Unexpected & Compelling. We Loved It!,9,30 January 2021,"The Little Things is a smart, gripping, well-crafted film about the difficult work of homicide investigation. It's not a ""whodunit"" or a murder-mystery. It's twisty and engrossing and in some ways, unresolved, but we found it very satisfying. It breaks new ground on a well-worn genre. The comparisons to Se7en, LA Confidential, and Zodiac really don't ring true except on the most superficial level. TLT has more in common with Rear Window and Touch of Evil. It's a throwback, sure, but the film also stands on its own with an inventive story and great cinematography.It's fabulously acted by all. Jared Leto made some really brilliant choices as Sparma. I got the chills watching him at times. He disappeared in this role and deserves kudos. Denzel did not disappoint. The subtlety in his haunted gaze, the sense of regret, and his yearning for retribution were all deeply felt. Rami Malek was an unorthodox choice in some ways, but his taut frame, sharp looks, and angular face played in nice opposition to Washington's soft, worn-out Deek. Malek's acting was nuanced and confident in a character very different than those he's known for. Together these two men built, what felt like, a genuine connection.If I had any criticism (some spoilers) I would say that the tone is a little inconsistent throughout and the ending lacked some emotional punch. I wanted to feel it in my gut. Maybe I've grown so used to cliche movies telegraphing the impending doom through dramatic music and fake intensity. The build up just before the fateful moment and the reverberations after were fairly quiet and somber, almost Hitchcockian. That's good, but it didn't rattle me the way I would've hoped. I feel like there was a beat or two missing in the ""dig"" scene that would've helped ratchet up the drama just a bit, but maybe that's not what this movie is really going for.I am thoroughly confused about the confusion others are having. There was no murderer found. It was not Sparma. Who's good and bad is not answered. It's all shades of murky grey. It's all very human and quite fragile. I found the ending poignant and also disturbing, which is a strange mix, though still satisfying.Nitpicking: The title is more fitting of a Lifetime movie and I don't quite get the concept of the little things are the ones that get you caught. It doesn't fit in with the case that haunts Deek, nor Jimmy's case. My super cheesy retitle would be The Haunting of Angels. Haha. But I really loved it and will watch it again!",The Little Things

This builds through the film and shows in his anger at the forensics expert. He is a father of daughters and these murders take on a deep personal meaning for him. He has to overcome the institutional and legal barriers to locking up who he is convinced is the murderer.Washington's character's friends have covered up his career mistake and this still haunts him. Protecting the conscience of a good cop and family man who makes a similar error becomes a kind of redemption.The real character puzzle is explaining the actions of Leto's character. Why does he taunt the investigators like he does if he is not the murderer. The only motivation that explains his actions is if he really is the murderer. Washington's character must also be convinced that is the case since he would understand the murders would continue with such a serial killer seeking sexual gratification with the act of murder. He must have been convinced the murderer was dead but still lacked the hard proof. Providing the beret false proof was just a way to erase the torment that plagued Malik's character he thought was justified.",The Little Things

While I do not support BLM, I can now understand what brought them to this point. My eyes have been opened. While most people will focus on the movie and be glad with the ending, I can only see police corruption, going after (possibly) an innocent person and everyone just playing along.Denzel was amazing as always.

I really liked the acting and the performances were actually pretty awesome. Leto's character is creepy AF, but you just can't decide if he did it or not or what his motives are exactly.There are a lot of red herrings to try to throw you off the scent of what is going to happen and it keeps things exciting and you're on the edge of your seat.And then the ending just takes all of that and says to hell with it. The ending was like a slap in the face. Awful. I hated it. If you consider yourself a casual movie watcher and just want to be entertained and have some kind of mystery where you are trying to figure it out and then there is a big reveal or some kind of climax that is exciting, then you will be disappointed in this movie.It's like getting on a roller coaster and the coaster starts going up the hill clicking and clacking forever, building up the anticipation and then at the top, it suddenly shoots up further 15 ft and then stops and the ride is over and you're left thinking, ""Well what was the point in all the build up?""Watch if you want but man this was a let down for me.",The Little Things

This story never really got off the ground. By the stage Jared Leto's sketchy looking character entered the film, I was already beginning to lose hope. Denzel and Malek both played their parts well as a detective troubled by the past and a young hot-shot detective, respectively. In my opinion Jared Leto performed well in his role as a man not all there, obsessed with crime.The cast is in no way to blame for a film that left us with more questions than answers.

Dunno why they went to the expense of setting this in the 1990s (and having to use all those ""vintage"" cars) when it would have worked just fine set in the present.

There was a detective story that was pretty underwhelming, but, seemingly, an equal amount of screen time was dedicated to California landscapes and watching people drive cars around them. Yup, some girls died, but Jared Leto had a pretty, green muscle car and that seems to be what the writer/director seemed to want to emphasize. This was listed as a ""psychological thriller.""

These two seeming unlikely partners embark on a journey know would would ever see. Leads, evidence, interviews, nothing that could predict their adventure together.
These two men make a great partnership. They give the film the dichotomy it needs. We find ourselves routing for both the new and the old and the good and the bad. I find myself guessing the outcome of each scene. Surprisingly stunned by each twist and turn.

The Denzel secret is weird also, why was he so trigger happy? Why did the other cops cover it up? Why was that girl just wondering in the woods while the other two were already murdered?

It's not quite an action movie, nor a thriller.
The plot felt very 'Se7enish', but to me more in a tribute kind of way.THE ONLY THING I COULD NOT WRAP MY HEAD AROUND was the godafwul editing.

As another reviewer said, it really is more a film about the characters and how their relationship changes throughout the movie.Jared Leto's character didn't even appear in the movie until almost half way through I think? He is set up to be the person of interest which you'll also see in the trailer. So it's s slow build up for a somewhat lackluster ending.I do like the characters, but Jared Leto's character Albert actually had me laughing. He's got jokes!

You know, the little things that make not just great or good movies, but watchable movies.This reminded me of Righteous Kill. Terrible like that. Great actors, terrible film. The story in this film is so utterly unbelievable if you have even the slightest knowledge of how a crime scene is conducted. A non detective police officer from another police force CAN NOT just get invited along to a murder scene for poops and giggles!! Whats wrong with Hollywood?? Do they thing we are stupid?? A police officer from another police force that is not a detective CAN NOT take vacation days so as to just simply join another police force's investigation into a serial killer......off the clock. This movie is really dumb. And Rami Malek should be really thankful someone decided to do a movie based on Freddie Mercury's life when they did. Because if this movie is any sort of display of his ability as an actor.....he'd better hope there is a Bohemian Rhapsody part 2 somewhere in his future because...yikes. Not good.

I feel this story took a turn that tried to make an audience feel okay about corruption but I'm not buying it. I know people will say I just don't ""get it"" because it's diving into the psychological trauma they experience in this field and what can happen to get someone to a breaking point.

however the movie had some quite suspenseful and nice directed scenes that i really enjoyed watching (most of the scenes with jared leto in them).
Jared Leto shows some of his best acting in this movie and Denzel Washington is great as always, which made Rami Malek's flat performance seem even more unreal.

The movie did have some interesting moments and I think that acting was done really good, but the movie missed that something which would make it great, that something that Se7en or Zodiac have.However, I think that there was a bit of experimentation in this movie and that is seen in the fact that more focus is on the Jimmy and Deke than on the killings. It doesn't matter if Sparma was the guy, because he was 'their boy' and no one else could have been guilty. The main topic, as I understood it, was the fact that history repeats itself and Jimmy has to go through everything Deke has already lived.If you think about their similarities (great detectives, both were married, both have two daughters) you see how the writer wanted them to be so much alike, including their inner drive to catch Sparma (because he's 'their boy').Overall, I think the movie had a lot od potential, but unlike some other thrillers, it has many boring moments and it doesn't keep you glued to the screen in expectation of something even more interesting than the previous scene.",The Little Things

Rami malek, was not as his best by far, but Denzel was great as always. The editing was not great either as there weren't many scenes that felt rushed, as it did not give us time to really take in what was being presented to us.

Jared Leto character was a weirdo for sure but I don't think he was the killer and that's why Denzel bought that barrette and sent it to Rami Malik so he doesn't stop being a cop and end up like Denzel did, that he didn't go anywhere in life and went back to being a normal cop because he accidentally killed that girl and never let it go.

The car was fine, what was the reason to get out of car and risk death?Rami Malek as detective Baxter digs the location for graves while constantly exposing his holstered gun to serial killer walking around him, really? A detective would do that? Or a regular person? Sorry but many times his acting was not done convincingly.Denzel as ""Deke"" has his own method working crime scenes. What is this method? Taking a room in shady hotel and looking at victim pictures? That's not a method. That's just an shame driven old man.Also Denzel is called a ""Legend"", why is that? What did he do, and why does it matter now?
...there are many pointless references and dialogues where I found my myself wondering why did they say these strange ""scripted"" lines. Many are comparing ""Seven"" to this movie but this is not ""Seven"", it's a bunch of punchlines and references glued together into some kind of script.

Leto was good as the wackadoo he usually plays, but Denzel and Rami couldn't make an emotional connection if you killed their first borns. I felt nothing. Absolutely nothing. There was nothing to make me care about any of these characters, which is a shame because the opening scene is good. You can just shut the movie off after that cause there's no point. The movie is an hour too long. My husband fell asleep and managed to wake back up before anything ever actually happens - an hour in.

Denzel's credibility is the only thing that kept this movie from going straight to DVD. Rami Malek was terrible. His character was poorly written and equally poorly executed. His lines felt forced and it felt like he was trying to be a certain way and it just didnt work. I found myself much more engaged in scenes he wasnt in. Jared Leto is super creepy but isnt in it enough.It was all there tho to have a good movie. A different director probably crushes it. But instead it felt like it was directed by a dollar store Fincher. Its a wannabe Se7en.

1093,brian-60132,"Where were all the ""Little Things""?",2,30 January 2021,"Denzel mentioned it several times in the movie, ""Its the little things"", so I was expected the bad guy to eventually be caught because of all the little thinks he left behind. I could just visualize a court scene with a mountain of evidence of little things unknowingly left behind by the perpetrator. Instead all we got was just a handful of very obscure things that might loosely be connected with anything to do with a murder case. For example, feeding roast beef to the one victim and then Denzel observing the suspect going into a roast beef restaurant. Well, then that fact should make only 3 million other people in LA county also suspects also.Then there were the little things that had nothing to do with the investigation yet were left unanswered by the script. Such as, whatever happened to Denzel's dog as he left it alone for what was expected to be just overnight. We'll never know, dog gone it!And then there was the problem with real world plausibility. For example, the opening scene in which the girl is driving down the highway at night and there are absolutely no other cars in sight. Really? This was LA county afterall. We shouldn't even talk about the logic of pulling over to a remote restaurant at night with all the lights off in the building and then wonder why the doors are locked. Gimme a break!I cringed at the digging scene at the end in which the detective decides to do all the digging himself, turns his back on an unrestrained murder suspect, and bends over a hole in the ground with his revolver within easy grasp by the suspect. I was certain that there was going to be a struggle that ended badly but apparently it was just the movie that ended badly. How many real world detectives would go for a mid-night ride all alone with a murder suspect and no backup? He doesn't even bother to call in his location or destination. Only in the ficticious county of movie-world Los Angeles.Oh, I did give it one extra star simply because it did have some sort of unique story line, not the usual type of cops and robbers story.",The Little Things

Other than Jared Leto's performance, which was excellent, it was hard to find much redeeming about the film. Denzel's performance was strong when he wasn't mumbling.

1100,supdat,Great potential but falls flat (spoilers),5,31 January 2021,"I had very high hopes for this movie with Ramy Malek and Denzel Washington. The positive was that, while it was slow moving, there was serious character development.Technically, most of the dialogue is at a low volume and often mumbled. Watch the movie with good speakers. If I had the option, I might have turned on CC.In addition, some of the plot devices were annoying. The two-way police mirror, the mysteriously ringing payphone. Setting the movie in the 1990's so that the payphones can be a big part of the plot.My biggest problem with the movie was that I found the most important scene unbelievable and incredible on several levels. First, as others have pointed out, Jim (the Ramy Malek character) likely would not have gotten in the car alone with a person who he believed was a serial killer. And if he did, he would not have agreed to dig the hole looking for the body, and turn his back on Albert (Jared Leto's character). Jim had his gun, but he made no serious attempt to force Albert to dig the hole at gunpoint.Second, the movie really did not lead me to believe by the time of that scene that Albert was the serial killer. He was definitely creepy, but more in a stoned way, then someone you thought was capable of killing multiple people, and doing an expert job of covering his tracks. I thought the movie was trying to make it clear that Albert was just messing with Jim by bringing him out to the middle of nowhere for no reason. I think Jim would have concluded Albert was not ""the guy"" long before that.It also seemed like Albert had an odd death wish, since he was baiting Jim, who had a gun and a shovel, and was obviously stressed out and on edgeSo not the worst movie I have ever seen, but I would not suggest it to anyone.",The Little Things

There were so many tense moments throughout that I just can't relate to anyone calling it boring. I think if you hate the movie it's because you wanted closure and you didn't get it. Who says crime dramas have to be solved? Many aren't in real life.I'll tell what I did observe though. None of the cars from either crime scene matched his. But he did say a different car was for sale when Deacon asked him about his. Also, not sure if it was intentional or just editing but the guy in the first scene did not have a beard and he appeared to be wearing glasses. However, you also can't ignore the fact that this guy worked at the appliance store and dealt with fixing electronics. The store owner did say the appointment was canceled before his guy could get there. Lights were out at the crime scene. Also it didn't go unnoticed that the guy fed the girls beef before he killed them. You also have to ask where did he take the detective and why did he have a key to the gate of somewhere so far away and remote?I only gave 8 stars because the last 15 min or so were not realistic. The riding with the guy, the amount of times he turned his back, the DIGGING!? Killing the guy seemed a little ridiculous. But the way he antagonized him made me wonder if he wanted to die.

Without the interruptions which have accompanied viewing at home, one was able to keep an eye out for details and not miss out on any of 'The Little Things'As the tagline goes 'It's the little things that get you caught' ... and, if you - the viewer, do not keep alert at all times, you will miss out on the bigger picture and lose the herrings ie 'the little things'. However, it's time to delve, albeit shortly, into Deputy Sherriff Joe Deacon's (Denzel Washington) investigations into the mind of a serial killer - one who plays games, taunts, baits and believes he will never be caught.'The Little Things' is definitely not a fast-paced thriller, it's more of an in-depth, thorough investigation involving a series of personalities each with his or her own agenda. Little did Deacon ('Deke') know that his past was going to intertwine with the present when he travelled up to LA to collect a piece of evidence for a trial in Kern County.Along the way he encounters Sergeant Jim Baxter (Rami Malek) whose supercilious attitude doesn't initially endear him to the viewer or to Deke for that matter. But he soon realises that Baxter is as thorough as he is and an alliance places them on the trail of the killer... an over-powering, mind-bending determination to right some wrongs.And this is where Jared Leto enters the investigation as the prime suspect - Albert Sparma. His performance is magnificent and well-deserving of his Golden Globe nomination. Whether he is or isn't the killer is for you to decide, but without a doubt he plays with the minds of the detectives.
As Leto states in an interview with IndieWire: ""I was attracted by the opportunity to do something that was transformative, not just psychological or emotional but a physical one as well""
 No more is Leto merely a 'pretty face', but over the years he has developed into an actor with a gripping personality.Mixing the hardened professionalism of Washington with the eagerness of Malik and the taunting of Leto, director - John Lee Hancock has come up with a cinematic MUST SEE which needs to be viewed in a cinema.

They don't even have a suspect until more than half way through the movie and then it ends with the lead guy killing him. It ends with them just covering it up and the cop who shot the victim sends a fake piece of evidence to the weird detective guy to make him feel better by making him think the guy he killed was the right guy. Like. . . if the suspect wasn't the right guy won't the serial killer just keep killing? And on the subject of major flaws - the entire 'point' of the movie is the little things will get you caught, but the two lead guys just mysteriously take off after the lead suspect goes missing. Nowhere in this movie does anything get anyone caught for anything in any way. I feel like I just watched a criminal minds episode with all the important parts cut out. Seriously I am CONFUSED.

Denzel phones in a typical Denzel performance, sleeping his way through each of his scenes.
Jared Leto plays his role with the enthusiasm of someone who just got their first role as an extra on a sitcom. Chewing on every scene he is in, with his flashing presence, to his dark and brooding conversations... Maybe little less joker and more normal guy being accused of murder.
The best thing in this snore fest was Michael Shannon, pulling some top notch Shannon as a detective, searching for..... wait.... Rami Malek... not Michael Shannon...This is what took my mind for most of the movie, Rami Malek is an amazing actor, he has shown he can pull some amazing transformations and yet he is almost an exact copy of Michael Shannon from *insert movies here*
The story was lacking any structure or momentum, I never felt anything for any of these characters which is an issue since we are stuck with them for over 2 hours.

You cannot just declare that characters will behave in a particular way without providing a substantial basis for those characters' evolutions. There simply wasn't enough here to make it believable that Detective Baxter would change his entire life perspective after just a few days and behave in the way he did the last third of the film. Likewise, the reveal at the end showing what happened in Deke's case was also not believable or sympathetic.

The vast majority of murder mystery movies are identical or they telegraph the plot and ending like 30 minutes into the movie. While the movie isn't action-packed, it does more than enough to keep you extremely interested in the movie, if not on the edge of your seat. I feel like the writing for this film as well as the plot would have only worked with actors that are on the same level as those that are in the film. The three main characters are played by academy award winners and it definitely shows as they all did a fantastic job. Credit has to go to the writers as well as the end of the movie was amazing. It was amazing to me for multiple reasons. The first being that the ending was that the killer could have been found and yet not found at the same time. It's ambiguous without needing anything from the audience. For instance, many films have you choose the ending. I cannot STAND that kind of ending. If I wanted to make my own ending, I would be a screenwriter. Secondly, the chemistry and relationship that Denzel Washington and Raimi Malek's characters had were awesome. Finally, for once, I really had no idea what was going to happen at the end of the film. This is the best movie I've seen in quite some time and certainly Denzel's best movie since 2 guns.",The Little Things
1137,ormaybethatsjustmereviews,"If you've seen any LAW AND ORDER episode, you've seen this movie",4,13 July 2021,"Of all 'The Little Things' that I could have missed in the aforementioned title-it was the important plot point of the movie being entirely set in 1990. With the pagers, the older model cars of our now souped up catties, I even somehow failed to notice that there were no phones. Insert facepalm here. Sure, maybe that could have been because I was more focused on the characters than the setting. However, no excuse will genuinely be made. I did at the very least notice before the movie was over-just about halfway through-that it was indeed set before I was born. To TLDR this, I am by no means a movie reviewer and fail to spot significant and obvious plot devices. Despite that, I will attempt to do a movie review.I have to settle on the fact that the movie, as well as some of the performances, were very superficial. Perfect example, Rami Malek. Normally, I love seeing Rami Malek star in just about anything. I watched 'Mr. Robot' and 'Before Dawn' for him. The ladder of which he was enjoyable to watch at the least. He was emotive, interesting, and switched up his scenes. Of course, this was motion capture, a game, and one has to be overly emotive or the markers catch virtually nothing. Same with Bohemian Rhapsody, where we see him embody the great Freddy Mercury along with all his quirks and mannerisms. In a nutshell, Rami can act.However, I unfortunately was put in an unfounded position of questioning if that previous notion was accurate. I do believe he is a great actor when he is passionate about something. I call this the Kristen Stewart Syndrome. So, maybe the better question is, was he passionate about this project or was it just a job? Or, could it even be the simple fact that he shared all but a handful of scenes with one of the greats, Denzel Washington?I'd like and hate to believe that the ladder was the case. It's just not what actors do. You don't get nervous and bomb a performance because you're in a scene with someone you admire. But, if that were true, it wouldn't account for the stoney acting in the film entirely. With that being said, sometimes the best explanation is behind the scenes. It could all boil down to the director's choice and input. ""Rami, calm down, you're giving too much emotion, Jim is supposed to be stoic because everyone is supposed to see him as a mystery man, super detective, who just garners respect as he enters the room. You know what that looks like don't you? Right, nothing! Do absolutely nothing with your face!""Now, this is by no means a rag on Rami Malek. I want to point that out and make it very clear. He's a mighty fine actor. I just think this was a miss. There are a few in all actors' repertuars. It happens. I know if I were an actor I would be just as readily set to star alongside Denzel Washington as anyone else and would take that opportunity if handed to me. I just think it was a wrong call if he wasn't going to bring anything to this character. He may have just not been the right fit and that's unfortunate.So, let's do a change of pace here. By far my biggest distraction was Rami Malek, but there was another thing that bothered me. The movie was not slow to me by any means. It was the attempts at being a forensic murder mystery with another mystery of a mysterious defamed cop who is obsessed with an innocent until proven guilty weird man who looks and acts like a stereotypical murderer. But, there was no real mystery. Everything was fairly predictable, and that is saying a lot from someone who didn't even realize the whole movie is set in 1990.It felt like I was watching a Law and Order special that was 2 hours long and an hour longer than necessary. As paced as this was, it felt off. It felt slow only because nothing new was happening. Everything that has been done in a cop show before was done here.This all being said. I did like the choice of music. ""I follow him"" as they follow the suspect was pretty funny and cute to me. It was a change of pace to the dark atmosphere. I only say dark due to subject matter, because the actual film itself wasn't all that dark. It played it up to be, but the film wound up being more of a buddy cop movie set in a different universe with less lighting.In a lot of ways, I get what the director/writer John Lee Hancock was trying to do. The characters are like a reflection of one another. Similar, but of each other in different times. The older version is quiet, outwardly apathetic, and analytical. He has a past and he has his enemies with his demons hitching a ride in the back seat. The younger one has more enthusiasm for the cases, more feelings. He has the beginnings of that crack in his youth that comes with age, adulthood, and working as a detective. He's seeing the sharp edges of a cruel world that he can not dull and it's getting to him. This is a slow snake slithering up his leg and infecting his body and world around him. Then, the older version keeps seeping in as we continue the movie until he becomes him. Simple enough. However, it just doesn't work. The formula is saturated and it's hard to create a new approach to a troupe.All that being said; the following contains spoilers.So, I guess the Director noticed and decided to change it up for the last 30 mins of the movie because it hen turns into one dumb decision no seasoned cop would ever make which then sets off a butterfly effect. They may have hinted that Jim was more of a loose cannon that needed to save people, needed answers, and would increasingly do anything to get them. But, he was still a cop that went by the rules. He wouldn't even let a witness ID the killer because she saw him in handcuffs before she saw his line up picture. He cares about compromising the case, so why would he get in a car alone with the suspect to drive God knows where on the premise that this known liar wasn't lying? He doesn't know if this guy has a hoard of guns stashed away wherever he's taking him. The killer now has the upper hand because you willingly entered his territory. It makes no sense for the character. Maybe he was banking on Deke to follow, but he wouldn't have known he'd come across them leaving and following.Then he follows the commands of the would be killer because, reasons(?) to dig multiple graves, which tire him out and keep him off his guard. He was just so convinced that this man was a killer that he weakened himself in the presence of this killer in order for him to keep talking? I would be more worried that I'm in the middle of nowhere with this man and any moment he could take me out. I've already dug holes for him to drop me into.Regarding the ending. It was unfortunate, much like the whole film. Where to begin about the end? The fact that apparently we can just kill a victim in front of a ton of people and no one told? They just sent him away and that's it. Everyone just keeps the secret and the medical examiner keeps the bullet Deke used to kill the victim on her keychain. It jumps into a murder cover up all of a sudden. The only thing I liked about the ending was the pep talk about not getting caught because the little things are what get you caught. The ending implies that Jim will end up like Deke and it becomes a cycle of many obsessed cops. Deke fakes finding the red burrett in order to make sure Jim doesn't end up like him, riddled with guilt and ruining the life he built around him because of it. Deke saved him when he couldn't save the woman he killed. However, it doesn't help the actual case. It stops it for Jim. That attempt at his salvation will crumble if they do indeed find the true killer; whom we never find out it is. It's a temporary fix, as all things are.In the end, the movie was not anything it was expected to be. I honestly expected more. I expected to be surprised entirely. I only got a small jolt of that from the falsification of the barrett. Aside from that the movie was, in a word; unfortunate.",The Little Things

He is currently working a Murder case which he has taken personally, and it's affecting him off the clock. He ignores calls from his wife etc.Deke, is the same, except he lost all the good stuff. He let his murder case consume him, and as a result a suspect was shot and killed and covered up. Which broke Deke and he lost it all.Deke becomes sort of a mentor for Baxter trying to warn him of his behavior, which would be all well and good if the people around Baxter weren't so useless.Julies crime scene window, the stolen car report that was never submitted. They had a star witness (our girl from the beginning of the film, who, not going to lie, i thought was going to be a part of the film. High priority killer case, this girl possibly escaped. Yeah lets not investigate that gas station from beginning.) If Sparma was the killer and she did see him, the fact that she saw him in cuffs before she looked at photos, any lawyer worth their salt is getting Sparma off on that one.Every time we have to deal with the ""other cops"" something either gets screwed up or not finished, or they give the idea that they don't care. OK at least Baxter and Deke care.They care soo much that they get frustrated and both murdered their lead suspects and covered it up. This is either the WORST POLICE PRECINCT in the history of police. What is this place?I stopped concerning myself with the main story and started looking for all the little signs that ""Cops are Bad"" and believe me, there are A LOT in this film.They tried to end it like Se7en, except Kevin Spacey confessed, provided evidence of his crime (which gives closure) and that's why Brad Pitt loses it.This film does none of this, no closure for the audience ( you can speculate if you were paying attention to the songs on the radio, Deke and Baxter practically throw that at you through the tv.)I would have liked this movie more IF:
They actually caught Sparma because of some sort of little thing that the Crime Buff over looks that the Veteran Detective does not.I still kill Sparma in my version, after we get confimation that hes the killer because of some evidence that the Crime Buff overlooked, that our Veteran Detective finds you know.... a little thing.If you want to kill Sparma, have Deke do it.

He doesn't have any character except that he's a ""detective"" in a suit that has a family at home. Would love to know how he can afford such an extravagant home on a young detectives salary. There's also a laundry list of continuity and pacing issues with this movie. I also wish there wasn't so much music playing while I'm trying to watch a movie.

1194,tayleebrae,Worth watching...ignore the bad reviews,9,22 August 2021,"First the bad reviews on this movie must be coming from people not alive in the early 90's. I don't mean this in a negative way. It's just that people born after 1980 might not get a lot of the references, places, procedures, etc.Second, I have been waiting for a movie like this to come around for 10+ years. It is so refreshing to watch a movie with an actual story, an interesting story. A movie that establishes all the characters well enough for you to know them. A movie that keeps you interested the entire way through so well that you actually get lost in the movie. Unfortunately I'm painfully aware I'm watching a movie these days and it's because they just don't have enough story, intrigue, substance, etc. This movie even managed to throw a curveball towards the end that I don't think I've ever seen done. Usually you watch a movie about serial killers and the only thing they aim for is stopping the killer. This ending was about so much more. The producers, writers, actors, editors, etc should all be given major awards.",The Little Things

me to watch this film.As in other review I read, I thought it could have been better. I'm also not sure
how/why they focused so strongly on Jared Leto's character. High mileage car?Can someone tell me what was done to Jared's face? I found him almost unrecog-nizable.

1197,mohammad-fegh,Low-end Zodiac+Se7en,6,30 January 2021,The movie lacks pauses so that the audience feels the scenes and gets engaged in them. The chemistry between rami and Denzel is not Pitt-freeman like and rami is not right for this part. the transition from a scene to another is not smooth it's like the editing throws you into the next scene without getting the grip of the previous one. The acting is bad in the first half even from Denzel but it gets better. The cruel and ambiguous ending is good but the movie doesn't build up a cruel world and atmosphere to be coherent with the ending it represents. The movie seriously suffers from a lack of suspense.,The Little Things

You have a wonderful cast and the story begins great and draws you in quickly. They completely lost me when Jim Baxter (Malik) climbs into the suspects, Albert Sparma's (Leto), car and they drive away in the night. Even in fantasy land this is completely ridiculous and everything that happens from that point on is ridiculous and the story really ends there, unfortunately.Instead of watching a great thriller/mystery you end up with nonsense and a bunch of cops having accidentally killed two people and then the preposterous story of covering the deaths up. That's it......just bumbling experienced Homicide detectives accidentally killing people and hiding it.I'm shocked that any of the three main actors would sign on to this.

He killed the blonde girl because she could id him. He let Jimmy kill Albert so he could stop looking ino the murders. He sent him the barrette so he would believe he killed the right guy.

I believe this is the first one I've seen where the story is told with at least one of the detectives being in frame at all times. That is, we see the story from their perspective, with all the pros and cons this brings. No tips, no clues for the viewer - what you see is what you get.We did not see the murderer. The chase in the opening scene was with a blue car, but not Deke's Ford. Albert has a green and a yellow car. Plus, the guy at the beginning looked nothing like any of them.For me, this movie is to show how hard detectives' work is, and how emotional they can become pursuing the culprit. Some loose ends, yes, but that's life - not everything makes perfect sense, right?",The Little Things

All the main actors are great, Denzel, Jared, and Malek. So much is left to our imagination. We are not sure who the murderer is, but my mind is constantly trying to analyze events of the crime and analyze the characters to see who is really guilty. Definitely a psycho thriller!",The Little Things

1218,mcolinmiller,The Little Things...matter in movies too.,5,31 January 2021,"A half hearted attempt of the classic noir. Much of the premise (especially the end) is a copy of Se7en, but less clever. The dialogue is bland. Denzel and Jared Leto do the best they can with a poor script. Rami Malek gradually got better but was not saved by the ridiculous climax.
This movie completely misses the mark on character development. Which sucks because it seemed like it was more about the mental and emotional deterioration of these detectives than it is about the physical crimes. I do give props to Hancock for the final scene and how it relates back to what the film is truly about. However it feels as if he expects the actors to pick up all the slack while he only lifts a finger.
There are some positives worth mentioning. Production design and the cinematography help paint a darker version of LA. Also the post production/editing doesn't feel rushed, which helps cover up the direction of the film.
Overall it's worth a watch. Just don't get your hopes up on something that generates award buzzing.",The Little Things
1219,mmickelini,I'd rather relive 2020 than watch this film again!,3,20 February 2021,"3 academy award winning actors; What could possibly go wrong?I don't believe I've ever been this disappointed by a film in a very long time. The editing of this film alone is so absolutely atrocious that it makes it unbearable watch. I continued to watch only due to the fact that this film employed 3 subsequently incredible actors in Rami Malek, Jared Leto, and of course the wonderful Denzel Washington. Unfortunately, their acting could only go so far with how poorly written this film was. This film was no less enjoyable than watching a train wreck in super slow motion; you know where the ending is leading, but you are still dissatisfied with the outcome.Fooled by an incredible cast, and a trailer that leads the viewer to believe this film could be just as good, if not better, than previous mystery/crime films such as: Prisoners, Se7en, Silence Of The Lambs, and Kiss The Girls, the film finds itself slowly dive bombing by its lack of creative direction, awful editing, b-list writing, and anti-climactic ending.Let me put it this way; You sit down at a fine dining restaurant(that was how the film was promoted with 3 academy award winning actors). You order an incredible meal(trailer of the film). The server brings you out a plate of food filled with everything you're allergic to, and it was prepared by the night crew at Taco Bell(Horrible writing, terrible editing, subpar acting).
