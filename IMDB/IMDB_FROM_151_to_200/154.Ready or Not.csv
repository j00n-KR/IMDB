0,MartinHafer,Enjoyable but clearly NOT a film for most viewers....be forewarned!!,8,31 October 2020,"""Ready of Not"" is a very, very violent, bloody and crude film. I am not necessarily criticizing it for this, but you must know this before you decide to watch. It clearly is an adult film...but even one most adults might have trouble watching because of all the gore. Be forewarned...you will see extreme violence, exploding people and more!!! Think twice before you watch!!This should be the best day of Grace's life. After all, she's just married a handsome guy from an incredibly wealthy family. But apparently, this marriage comes with a possible downside....the family are all Satan worshipers who owe their immense wealth to their demon master. And, as part of maintaining their wealth, they have a ritual for when new blood marries into the family...and if you pick the wrong card, the family hunts you and sacrifices you! What follows is this crazy family and their servants chasing Grace about in order to kill her and impress their lord and master!Despite the summary and TONS of blood and gore, the film is also a comedy. It's not a fall on the floor laughing sort of film but a darkly sick and twisted sort of comedy. The ending combines both...intense gore and the biggest laughs of the movie. Not everyone's taste...but funny and sick. And, it's also not for those who get motion sick, as the shaky cam is, unfortunately, overused in the movie.",Ready or Not
1,Leofwine_draca,I was expecting more,5,20 October 2020,"READY OR NOT is an interesting film but also a deeply flawed one that's never quite as funny or as entertaining as it tries to be. I liked the whole idea of the sinister rich family in their wonderful 'old dark house' inspired mansion and the idea of the heroine being hunted down, a little like the French flick FRONTIERS. Unfortunately what promises to be a TURKEY SHOOT-style cat and mouse story of human hunting turns into a largely aimless comedy with repetitive set-pieces and a sub-par script substituting bad language for wit. It's a pity, as the direction is solid and the performances are strong, but imagine this cast with proper dialogue to play with! I also found the climax a cop out as I was expecting this kind of over-obvious thing to happen. Not a bad film, just something I was expecting more from.",Ready or Not
2,SnoopyStyle,fun B-horror,7,28 October 2020,Grace (Samara Weaving) and Alex (Mark O'Brien) are getting married at his rich family's massive estate. She's informed that she must play a game before being admitted into the family. It's a matter of life and death.I didn't expect much from this B-horror with no big fanfare. One or two of these fun little horrors out-jumps its peers every year and this is one of them. It has a lot of fun. Samara is a solid lead. It has a fun takedown of wealth and family corruption. The movie takes a fun thrill-filled idea and executes it. It's comparable to Happy Death Day.,Ready or Not
3,claudio_carvalho,The Wedding Game,6,19 December 2019,"Grace (Samara Weaving), who was raised in foster houses, meets Alex Le Domas (Mark O'Brien), who belongs to a wealthy traditional family, and they soon fall in love with each other. They decide to get married to each other at the Le Domas mansion and during the wedding night Alex tells to Grace that shall play a game to join the family. Grace meets the whole family in an isolated room and draws a card from the deck. When she shows the ""Hide and Seek"" card, the family members ask her to hide while they hunt her down in the mansion in a weird ritual to Satan.""Ready or not"" is a black humor comedy with lots of gore highly funny for fans of the genre. The characters are great: Alex´s brother Daniel is alcoholic; his wife Charity is a hunter of dowry; Alex´s father Tony is a wealthy man who cares to the tradition; his wife Becky seems to be reasonably sane but the family comes first; Alex´s sister Emilie is a crazy addicted woman; her husband Fitch is a lazy man; Alex´s Aunt Helene is evil. When the hunting starts, the situations are funny and non-sense as dawn approaches and the family fears to be terminated by Satan. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Ready or Not - O Ritual"" (""Ready or Not - The Ritual"")",Ready or Not
4,nogodnomasters,"He is useless, but he is one of us",8,13 September 2019,"The film is a dark comedy and a generic spoof of family ritualistic satanic films. It opens with a wedding to Beethoven's 9th symphony D minor etc played during ""Clockwork Orange"" while Alex DeLong was being tortured by his own love for the music. Grace, a commoner (Samara Weaving) is going to wed Alex Le Domas whose family has ""more money than God."" They made their money from the manufacturing of games. At Midnight, they must play a game drawn from a card taken from an old box that they play or die. Grace was hoping for checkers.The title hints at the game and film poster of an armed bride who is dirty, tattered, and torn tells you what happens. The film had a number of light moments with an ending that made me laugh. Melanie Scrofano plays Emilie who loves her cocaine and can't shoot straight. Some of the players are apathetic about the game but play because they are told they must or die. The family consisted of a cast of characters that made the film fun.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.",Ready or Not
5,kosmasp,Just a game,8,8 February 2020,"Or is it? Right from the start we do realize there is more to it than just a simple game. So with that overshadowing the next section of the movie (viewer being ahead of our main character/heroine), it is up to the actors and the dialog/script to keep us on our toes and make this entertaining nonetheless.And the movie succeeds in doing so. I guess it could have been even better in some respects, but overall this is really good. The characters make sense (in their own universe) and the story is coherent enough (even if you may disagree with that statement during the end - I think the joke works quite well ... but that's me). Not for the faint hearted for sure ...",Ready or Not
6,lee_eisenberg,"here comes the bride, all dressed in intensity",9,25 August 2019,"Two years ago, ""Get Out"" addressed racism through the prism of a not-what-it-seems relationship. Now, ""Ready or Not"" looks at class structure through the same format. Much like how ""Crazy Rich Asians"" showed how rich people expect their children only to marry within their ""respectable"" range, this one shows how anyone from outside the country club crows is immediately ""the other"" to these people. And if the bride is the other, you can do whatever you want to her. Mind you, there are some shocking scenes. But it's all well done. Definitely see it.",Ready or Not
7,jboothmillard,Ready or Not,7,6 October 2019,"I saw the trailer at least four times before the film's release, it looked like a good concept for a scary movie, and I'm glad it received positive reviews, including from Mark Kermode, so I was really looking forward to it. Basically, the wealthy Le Domas family hosts a generations-long tradition of playing a game at midnight on the wedding night with each new addition to the family. In a flashback many years ago, young Alex Le Domas (Chase Churchill) and his brother Daniel (Etienne Kellici) witness the killing of a man named Charles (Andrew Anthony), who has just married their aunt Helene (Elana Dunkelman). Thirty years later, Grace (Samara Weaving, Hugo's niece) is the newest addition to the Le Domas family, having married Alex (Mark O'Brien), who has been estranged from the family for years. Alex is hesitant to be back at the family estate, but Grace reassures him and is eager to become part of his family. Following the wedding ceremony, Grace is informed of the family initiation custom and meets with the rest of the in-laws. Participating in the tradition with the happy couple are Alex's alcoholic brother Daniel (Adam Brody), father Tony (Henry Czerny), mother Becky (Andie MacDowell), Daniel's snobbish wife Charity (Elyse Levesque), Alex's drug-addicted sister Emilie (Melanie Scrofano), Emilie's whiny husband Fitch Bradley (Kristian Bruun), and Tony's older sister, the sombre Helene (Nicky Guadagni). Tony is told that she must draw a card from a mysterious wooden box and play whatever game is written on the card with the family and become a member of the ""dominion"". Tony tells the story of his great-grandfather Victor Le Domas, who made a deal with a man named Mr. Le Bail, who helped to create the Le Domas fortune if the family established the tradition. Grace draws from the box a card that reads ""Hide and Seek."" Grace believes the game is harmless, she will be hiding while the other family members seek. While she leaves to hide in the estate, the Le Domas family, excluding Alex, arm themselves with antique weapons to hunt her down. Alex manages to find Grace before his family, they witness Emilie accidentally kill a maid, shooting her in the head with a shotgun. Alex didn't tell Grace about the Le Domas tradition, believing says the odds of Hide and Seek being chosen being unlikely, it is the only game that would prompt the family to try to kill Grace. The Le Domas family believes that if they fail to kill Grace before dawn, they will all die as part of the deal with Mr. Le Bail (whose name is an anagram of Belial, an alias for Satan), decades earlier. Grace is shocked and angry with Alex at not telling her about the ritual, but he feared she would leave him. Against his family's wishes, Alex promises Grace he will help her escape, he heads to the house's security room and tells Grace to go to the kitchen. While looking for the exit, Grace encounters a second maid, she accidentally activates the mechanical dumbwaiter elevator and kills the maid. Daniel, who is also against the family tradition, finds Grace in the study. She pleads with him for help, but he says he has no choice, but offers her a ten-second head start before he alerts the others. Alex deactivates the security cameras and unlocks the doors of the house. However, he is captured and restrained by the family when they discover his betrayal. Grace tears her wedding gown to free her legs for mobility and arms herself. She manages to escape the kitchen after eluding the family butler Stevens (John Ralston), scalding him with boiling water. The family members regroup and lament the difficulty in killing Grace but reiterate they must do so before sunrise. During this discussion, Emilie accidentally kills a third maid with a crossbow through the head. Stevens informs the family Grace has escaped outside but promises to capture her. Grace hides in the barn, there she is shot in the hand by Emilie's son Georgie (Liam MacDonald), falling into the ""goat pit"" where the family have hidden the remains of previous victims. Grace manages to climb out and escapes through a fence, injuring herself further, and fails to stop a passing motorist for help. On the road, Stevens chases after Grace in a car, but she manages to temporarily disable him and takes the car after gets out. She tries to call for help using the vehicle assistance company, but the car was reported stolen and the car is disable remotely, allowing Stevens to tranquilize and capture Grace. Stevens drives her back to the estate, but Grace wakes up and causes him to crash the car, killing him. Grace runs, but Daniel discovers her, knowing that Tony is secretly watching, he knocks her out again and recaptures her. The Le Domas family prepares to sacrifice Grace in a Satanic ritual. They each drink from a cup as part of the ritual, but vomit, besides Daniel who has poisoned them all, saying they deserve to die. While Alex escapes his captivity, Daniel frees Grace and they attempt to leave the house. But Daniel is shot and killed by Charity. Grace starts a fire, but the family members ignore it and continue to pursue her. She gets into a fight with Becky and manages to beat her to death with the box. Alex arrives and realises that, even if he lets Grace live, she won't want to be with him, he captures her and alerts the family. The family try again to sacrifice Grace, holding her down. Alex tries to stab her in the heart but misses and stabs her in shoulder. They then see that the sun has come up, meaning it is now too late. As they recoil in horror for their impending death, nothing happens. Helene plans to kill Grace anyway, but as she grabs the axe, she suddenly explodes into a bloody mess. One by one, the other family members look in horror and try to flee as each blow up. Tony pleads for a reprieve to Mr. Le Bail, but to no avail and dies. Last to go, Alex begs Grace for forgiveness, but explodes when Grace demands a divorce. As the house is engulfed in flames, Grace momentarily sees the figure of Mr. Le Bail sitting at the head of the table. He nods in approval and allows her to leave, covered in the blood of the exploded Le Domas family members. Outside the house, Grace sits on the steps as the fire blazes behind her and smokes a cigarette as emergency services arrive. When someone asks her what happened, Grace shrugs and replies: ""In-laws"". Also starring Kate Ziegler as Young Becky. Weaver gives a fantastic as the unsuspecting bride who inadvertently becomes the victim of a deadly game, the other cast members, including an against-type MacDowell, play the aristocratic family with a dark agenda very well. The twisted game of Hide and Seek is the main draw, and the deal with the devil element is clever, there are some thrilling moments, but it not just tense, it is also witty and very funny, with the madness and slaughter being the butt of the joke, a great fun black comedy horror. Very good!",Ready or Not
8,BA_Harrison,Weaving's scream is the real horror.,4,26 September 2019,"After Grace (Samara Weaving) marries into a wealthy family who have made their fortune creating board games, she finds that she must participate in a game of hide and seek before she will be properly accepted as one of the clan. But as Grace hides in the sprawling family mansion, her new in-laws tool up with a variety of weapons and set out to find and kill the young woman as part of a Satanic ritual.After watching Mayhem and The Babysitter, I found that I had developed a strong aversion to Samara Weaving's scream, a horrible warbling sound that sets my teeth in edge, but I was willing to try and put my animosity to one side for Ready or Not, the trailer for which looked like a lot of fun. I failed: her scream still got on my nerves, but as it happens, Weaving's warbling was just one of many reasons why I didn't enjoy this film.All of the characters are unlikable (Grace included) and unbelievable (husband Alex does a 180-degree personality flip), the plot goes nowhere for most of the film, the intended dark comedy falls horribly flat, the ending is predictable (reminding me a little of Drag Me To Hell), the location is underused (the servants tunnels, in particular, are totally wasted), and for a film given an 18 certificate for 'bloody violence and strong scenes of gore', there's very little in the way of inventive or graphic kills. Also, try as hard as you can, but you'll never convince me that it is possible to saw through a solid piece of hardwood with the chain on a pair of handcuffs.Save your money, save your time and save the strain on your ear drums (that scream!!!).3.5/10, generously rounded up to 4 for the creepy Hide and Seek song.",Ready or Not
9,BandSAboutMovies,A surprise and delight,8,24 August 2019,"Marriage - especially the ceremony itself - can be terrifying. The best horror movies take a frightening moment in our lives and show how ""what's the worst that can happen"" explodes outward into a spiraling miasma of sheer madness. In a year sadly bereft of many great - or even halfway decent - horror films, Ready Or Not has arrived to squarely punch you right in the face and spit blood in your eye.For generations, the wealthy Le Domas family has remained in power by conducting a ritual on the night that anyone new enters the family. Tonight, prodigal son Alex has returned home to marry Grace (the niece of Hugo Weaving, who also appeared in The Babysitter and Mayhem), an orphan who has been raised in foster homes.Years ago, the great-great-grandfather of the Le Domas family made a deal with Mr. Le Bail and the family must play one game - they're pretty much Hasbro in real life - at the end of the wedding ceremony. It could be something as simple as Old Maid. Yet it ends up being the worst card - Hide And Seek.Now, the entire Le Domas family is hunting down Grace, who only thinks that she's playing a game. Maid after maid gets caught in the crossfire and the entire extended family - children included - are armed, dangerous and after our heroine.Henry Czerny shines as Tony Le Domas, the crazed leader of the clan, and Andie McDowell is wonderful as his somewhat conflicted wife Becky. One of the relationships at the center of this film is between good brother Alex and bad sibling Daniel ((Adam Brody, Seth from The O.C.). Of course, this being horror, what is good and what is evil will change throughout this long night of the soul.There are parts of this film that aspire to be more than mere slasher or modern horror. That's a good thing. It may be me reading into things, but the scene where Grace escapes into the fields was reminiscent of the framing and pace of Suzy Kendall being chased in Sergio Martino's Torso. And without giving too much away, the close finally delivers on the levels of gore and supernatural menace that has been slowly hinted during the film's run time. Joyously, this feels like a movie with no dead spots, growing tighter and taunter as the slowly more blood-caked and torn wedding gown that Grace wears throughout.I have to single out Nicky Guadagni, who was in Cube, for her portrayal of Helena. The loss of her husband at the film's start has warped her into the twisted center of this family, despite what the male head would have you think. She's turned her loss into less than sacrifice and more of a reason for being. Drug addict sister Emilie (Melanie Scrofano, the lead on SyFy's Wynonna Earp) is pretty great, too.So often, modern horror hasn't been certain how to combine humor and terror. Ready Or Not gets it right. Then again, I have a weird sense of humor, so I laughed joyously at moments that no one else found funny. Too bad - I would have preferred to see this in a much rougher theater than the comfortable place where it unspooled so that people would have been unafraid to scream and yell at the screen. After all, that's what movies are for.Ready Or Not was directed by Matt Bettinelli-Olpin (V/H/S) and Tyler Gillett (Devil's Due), who are part of the Radio Silence film collective. It was written by Guy Busick (Stan Against Evil) and Ryan Murphy (Minute's Until Midnight).I will spoil one part of the film. At the close, as Grace draws a drag of cigarette despite being covered in grime, gore, viscera and her own blood, there's an echo of a movie from the past, Heathers. That made me clap in the theater - despite the machinations of family, the man she loves and even fate, Grace is not going away without a fight. Her spirit is one that even the devil must sit up and take notice of - quite literally.",Ready or Not
10,Coventry,Here they come. She can't hide...,6,2 July 2020,"They're going to find her. And make her suffer...Sorry, but when you see that title, how can you not automatically complete the lyrics of the 1996 smash-hit by The Fugees? Anyway, ""Ready or Not"" is a very entertaining and surprisingly competent action/horror ride with a strong feminine protagonist, a healthy dose of humor and a handful of inventively gory gimmicks. I state ""surprisingly"" competent, because thus far I only knew the directors Tyler Gillett and Matt Bettinelli-Oplin from the anthologies ""Southbound"" and ""V/H/S"" and, well, I though they both sucked. This film blends two very familiar horror themes, namely hunting for humans and severely dysfunctional murder-families, but present them in a very fun and enjoyable format. Grace and Daniel celebrate their wedding's day at Daniel's parental estate. It's the first time the bride meets her in-laws, and basically only knows they are a bunch of eccentric rich people whose empire is built on generations of successful boardgames development. At midnight, and according to an ancient tradition, Grace must participate in a game of hide and seek before she's fully accepted into the family. Her wedding night will be wild and nasty, but probably not how she imagined it. If you look past some flaws and improbabilities (like some of the characters implausible behavioral changes) you'll find this an enjoyable movie. The grotesque and bloody finale is hilarious, the hide-and-seek nursery tune is creepy, and the performances are good. It's particularly fun to see Andie MacDowell is a highly unusual role for a change. I swear you'll never look at ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" in the same way again.",Ready or Not
11,writers_reign,Hide And Sleek,5,30 September 2019,"I've just read approximately a dozen negative reviews right here on imdb and I'm guessing that these were penned by the Nightmare On Elm St/Halloween set i.e. the kind of moviegoer who takes gore seriously and thus feels let down by this tongue-in-cheek entry. I, on the other hand, have yet to see a Saw (sorry about that, Texas Chainsaw Massacre or indeed anything remorely resembling 'horror' so I was happy to go along with this black comedy and bask in the laugh out loud moments that punctuated it. I doubt if it would claim to be another Some Like It Hot, or even Young Frankenstein but it's harmless and reasonably entertaining.",Ready or Not
12,Calicodreamin,Crazy from beginning to end,8,1 September 2019,"I will give it to ready or not, it does not let up! The whole movie is just utter insanity from the beginning to the last second. You think you're ready, but you're not, it's wild. Weaving does a great job as the main character, she's put through her paces and just keeps moving (and looks pretty badass doing it!). I really enjoyed the quirky nature of the dialogue and acting. You're laughing one minute, then gasping the next. They make no bones about the premise and each character plays their part beautifully. The ending is a bit weird, but in context it couldn't have ended any better. Really something.",Ready or Not
13,george.schmidt,Giddily dark and fast-paced horror thriller; Weaving gives a tenaciously primal turn.

14,neil-476,Great fun,9,12 November 2020,"When Grace marries into the Le Domas family, whose great wealth is from the sales of games, it's not a huge surprise to find out that a family game features on her wedding night. The game is Hide and Seek, and it turns out that the object is not so much to avoid being found, it's more to avoid being found and killed.This simple idea is played for all it's worth between a varied crop of family members and the necessarily resourceful Grace. The cast is low profile but very good, the film is nicely staged, there is a decent story and script, and the combination of bloodshed and laughs works well. This is not laugh-out-loud, but the steady stream of black comedy is constantly amusing.I really liked this.",Ready or Not
15,ferguson-6,Love Me Tender,7,21 August 2019,"Greetings again from the darkness. Rich people aren't like you and me (unless you happen to be rich, in which case you fall into the first category). Their houses are different. Their vacations are different. Their family traditions are different. And that's where this latest from co-directors Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillet (known collectively with Producer Matt Villella as Radio Silence) really kicks in. Yes, the Le Domas estate is a maze of dark wood, music rooms, and hidden passages, but it's the wedding day tradition of post nuptial game night that provides the thrills, chills, shocks and laughter for about an hour and a half.Former foster child Grace (a star-making performance from Samara Weaving, THE BABYSITTER, THREE BILLBOARDS OUTSIDE EBBING MO), is nervous and excited just before her wedding ceremony begins. Her husband to be is Alex Le Domas (Mark O'Brien), the black sheep of an ultra-rich family, and the ceremony is being held within the lush garden and fountain grounds of the Le Domas mansion. Grace loves Alex and seems to have come to grips with his family: alcoholic brother Daniel (Adam Brody) who is always hitting on her, Daniel's gold-digger wife Charity (Elyse Levesque), father and patriarch Tony (Henry Czerny) who is outspoken in his belief that Grace isn't good enough for the family, mother and matriarch Becky (Andie MacDowell) who seems confused about her feelings towards Grace, crazy-eyed Aunt Helene (Nicky Guardagni) who seems to hate all living creatures, and coke-head sister Emilie (Melanie Scrofano) who, along with her husband Fitch (Kristian Bruun) couldn't even get to the ceremony on time.The above lineup of players is crucial because of what happens next. For wedding day game night, Grace draws the ""Hide and Seek"" card, rather than the much preferred checkers or Old Maid. There is a nice set up for this tradition which includes a Faustian deal made by Great Grandfather Le Domas. It's that deal that turns 'hide and seek' into 'hunt and kill'. Oh yeah, Alex forgot to warn Grace about the stakes and it's a blast to watch her transition as she figures it out. A torn wedding gown and yellow Chucks make up the visual of a bride fighting back against the antique weapons of crossbow, pocket pistol, elephant gun and battle-axe. You got it right - this family tradition is absolutely bonkers ... and bloody ... and deadly.As has become the favorite pastime of Hollywood recently, the film torches the ultra-rich. But if you can overlook the political posturings, you'll find a devilishly fun irreverent farcical zinger that offers some similarities to CLUE and SLEUTH, as well as many other games and movies. It has some of the look of SAW, but with significantly more tongue-in-cheek. In fact, dark comedy thriller might be a proper description, but you'll likely find yourself laughing more often than jumping in your seat. It's a wonderfully crafted and paced film that understands exactly what it is ... an instant classic Midnight Movie (along with this year's SATANIC PANIC from director Chelsea Stardust).Co-writers Guy Busick and Ryan Murphy take full advantage of the ominous setting and the wicked set-up, however, a minor quibble would be that the dialogue could have been a bit wittier. Most of the laughs come courtesy of the moment or the actors, and the banter falls just a little short. The prologue provides a 30 year ago flashback that cautions us for the ride we are about to take, and even offers some insight into the characters as much younger versions of themselves. The opening credit sequence is a beautifully staged and filmed running shot of some classic board games, informing us of the industry closely associated with the Le Domas 'dominion'.It must be noted that a studio recently postponed the theatrical release of THE HUNT because of the political backlash to their premise - rich people hunting poor people. While the themes of these two films could be considered similar, only the most extreme hard-liners could view READY OR NOT as anything more than good demented fun. Much of the primary production was filmed on location at the Parkwood Estate in Ontario, and it's the perfect setting for a family that chooses murder and fortune over all else. Two standouts on the soundtrack include ""The Hide and Seek Song"" by Headquarters Music and ""Love Me Tender"" by Stereo Jane (definitely not Elvis). For those who enjoy the twisted comedy approach to in-law jokes and violence, there are plenty of macabre moments that will deliver a smile ... till death do us part.",Ready or Not
16,kannibalcorpsegrinder,Wild and fun over-the-top genre effort,10,29 December 2019,"Preparing to marry into a wealthy family, a bride learns of a tradition on the wedding night where they're going to play a game with the family, and upon learning they're to play hide-and-seek realizes there's a far deadlier secret motivation for the choice of games and tries to survive the family night.For the most part, this one was an absolute blast. Among the many positives here is the buy-in of such a ludicrous premise into being a believable part of the family's history. That the film is concerned early on with the secretive nature of the family tradition that they have to play in order to be accepted gives the film a deep backstory. The history lesson that tells of the history that explains how it all started as well as the continuous notions to stay on tradition hunting everyone with classic weapons and techniques speaks to the family's status and secret nature rather well. That leads into the titular game itself, which is an absolute high-energy blast that mixes together the ludicrous premise with fun action. That they're chasing her around the house as she's unaware of the true nature of what they're hunting her for gives the first few scenes a sense of crazy over-the-top work where they go around shooting at each other, wielding crossbows and trying to chop her to pieces provides some crazy visuals. The confrontations become quite fun as there are encounters in the secret catacombs of the house, in various game rooms and meeting parlors or outside on the estate grounds that showcase not only luck on her part to survive but also plenty of drive and determination to do so. In addition, there's a wicked sense of humor to come from these encounters and situations that gives the film a sense of fun. The general premise of hunting an oblivious woman in order to prepare her for a Satanic sacrifice allows this one to offer up some fun where they mistake each other for the target and get killed accidentally to where the reactions after-the-fact generate some funny moments. There are also the hysterical smart-aleck comebacks and quips that are featured here which provide this one with several fine chuckles as well, leaving this one to have enough to like here with the mixture of goofy comedy to alleviate the serious nature of the hunting. That leaves the finale as the main troublesome spot of the film which seems to be simply an individual basis. Due to the family's desire to capture her alive rather than outright killer her, the finale devolves into a series of scenes knocking her out only to drag her into the altar room for the ritual where she escapes and forcing the chase again. It feels repetitive and completely highlights the ending resolution which is a massive cheat and utter letdown. Taking a realistic but unsatisfactory course of action where she's completely passive and not responsible is a cop-out of the highest order, despite the wild action featured which might make some forgive this one. However, it's really the only area where this one approaches a flaw.Rated R: Extreme Graphic Language and Graphic Violence.",Ready or Not
17,phd_travel,Enjoyable horror,8,27 August 2019,"Story is the key here. It has to be logical in the framework of the story and it is. Things tie up. Comic bits are not frequent but they are spontaneous. The pace is good not running out of steam. Kept me interested till the end. It's also nice not to see monsters and zombies for a change.
Samara Weaving as the new daughter in law isn't stunningly beautiful which makes her right for the role. Adam Brody is likeable. Andie Macdowell suits the role of Mother in law in a Morticia like way.

It's watchable, that I'll admit, there is a bit of suspense, but other than that it's just not a movie I would keep in my collection. Horror and comedy can work but in this case I would just have skipped the comedy part. It was unnecessary and to be honest not that funny. The acting was good for some but bad for others, so even that was disappointing. I read somewhere reviewers comparing it to Get Out, really? If you never seen that one I recommend you that movie.

20,cherold,veers from comedy to horror with no integration between the two,4,12 January 2020,"After watching the first tedious half hour of Ready or Not I began to wonder if it was really the kick-ass comedy-horror movie of the trailer, so I took a look at the IMDB reviews. And I discovered, much to my confusion, that no one seemed to agree on whether the movie was a comedy or a horror movie. Some felt it was comedy-horror, but others felt it was a horror movie with a few comedy bits (that some liked and some didn't).Having watched the movie I now understand. The movie has scenes that are definitely comedic involving the ridiculous characters and some startling moments of comedic violence. And the movie has scenes of grim struggle and peril. But these scenes don't particularly feel like they're part of the same movie, and there's no integration of the two elements; no moments that are scary but funny or funny but scary.For me, the funny parts are quite good. But I found the horror elements intrusive in the way some reviewers here found the comedy elements intrusive. Which parts you find bothersome will be a matter, perhaps, or your expectations.By the halfway point I started fast forwarding through the horror bits just to see how it all turned out.There is a good comedy-horror movie trapped inside Ready or Not. There's also a decent B horror movie trapped in there. The two movies don't get along.The cast is quite good, particularly protagonist Samara Weaving, who has an intensity that makes her interesting even before things get crazy.To summarize: Boring first half hour, some really good comedy horror, some non-comedy horror that I guess is okay for that sort of thing, pretty good ending.Not recommended.",Ready or Not
21,FeastMode,almost no redeeming qualities.,2,19 April 2020,"This movie tries and fails at basically everything. it wasn't funny or creepy or scary. the gore was decent a few times. but there is really nothing here. so many dumb things happen, so you think maybe it's the kind of movie you shouldn't take seriously and just go with it. but then it switches to a serious scene. this happens repeatedly, it doesn't know what it wants to be. tone is all over the place. dialogue is terrible. samara weaving was good. that's about it.

22,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Here they come.,7,29 September 2019,"For me, the comedy in 'Ready Or Not (2019)' isn't all that successful. It's never particularly funny and its attempts at humour sometimes, but only sometimes, reduce immersion. Usually, however, this isn't an issue. The tone is pretty much spot-on for the knowingly absurd narrative, turning what could've been a self-serious and, therefore, seriously silly affair into a near inside joke with its tongue planted firmly in its cheek. The beauty of it all is that there's never an attempt to undercut the weight of the situation. It's a fight for survival, on both sides, and it's as messy as you'd expect. In fact, the comedic beats often serve more as character insights than anything else, allowing the piece to build an interesting and relatively realistic set of core players. Most characters react as you'd expect them to, which is rarer than you'd think. Also, the villainous family are given much more time and nuance than the trailers seemed to indicate. Everyone has an understandable mindset, even if it's violent and deranged, and a few key folk undergo some serious character arcs that are expertly established and surprisingly executed. Generally, the flick follows a predictable formula but it has more than enough charm to account for this. It becomes somewhat repetitive as it goes on but it's always compelling and its finale is subversively satisfying. There's not as much focus on 'fight-back revenge' as I anticipated, which actually makes for a more intriguing time. Where everything ends up is a shock, but it's built to so naturally that it feels inevitable. The whole thing is just so grounded, probably the most relatable version possible. It's entertaining throughout and it's always smiling alongside you. That doesn't mean that it misses out on the pain such a piece requires. There are several moments that should make you wince and the protagonist is certainly put through the wringer, both inside and out. The overall message is slightly muddled - though, to say why would be a spoiler - and the ending may just have been better if it went in another, hinted-at direction (mainly when it comes to clarifying what seems to be the movie's initial intent). Still, there are underlying themes which are interesting to explore retrospectively and the consistent focus on character is commendable. The experience, as it is, is both enjoyable and believable. Its story is purposefully silly, wonderfully so, and it's handled with a fantastic balance of humour and gravitas. I actually buy everything the affair is selling. I think I like it more now than I did just after the credits had rolled. There's never a dull moment, really. It's remarkably consistent entertainment. 7/10",Ready or Not
23,bowmanblue,So much fun,9,12 July 2020,"Sometimes a film is generally known as one thing, but - in reality - is totally something else. It would be easy to lump 'Ready or Not' in the 'horror' category and, yes, it does have numerous elements associated with the genre. However, it's so much more. And, by 'more' I mean better... and funny (in the darkest possible way!).I remember thinking that a lot of the best films (horror or otherwise) that seemed to be made in the eighties got going very early. They didn't waste any time with redundant plot details and allowed the audience to grow with the story and characters. 'Ready or Not' does this by kicking off with everything you need to know in the first ten minutes or so. A young woman has returned to her husband-to-be's luxurious family home in order to marry him in front of his - slightly aloof - family.All goes well until after the ceremony where he informs her that it's tradition that any newcomers to the bloodline must play 'a game.' She picks out the age old classic 'Hide and Seek.' A chance choice she soon learns to regret, as this involves the family hunting her down throughout the mansion with an assortment of weapons in order to slay her.'Ready or Not' could just have been some random horror-hunt film, but the main reason to watch isn't anything to do with viewing a film that will scare you, but simply to entertain. And it does this using 'black comedy' at every turn. Yes, the family are evil murderers, but they're just so damn funny that you can't help but enjoy their performance. Plus Samara Weaving is excellent as the main character, proving that strong female leads can still exist without turning them into some sort of 'Mary Sue' trope.It's not that long in length and the runtime flies by with a mix of gore (also played for laughs in many cases!) and an awesome script which is simply there to entertain the audience. If you like your gore mixed with very dark humour you really do have to watch this one. It's a modern classic and I hope they don't make a franchise out of this because it's perfect the way it is.",Ready or Not
24,ThomasDrufke,"""In-Laws""",9,4 September 2019,"A great trailer can really shape your expectations about a movie. What was initially thought of (and pitched) as merely a hide and seek horror film, there was no real reason to get excited about Ready or Not. But oh boy did that trailer (and the marketing campaign overall) completely shift my hopes for the film. And luckily, the film is exactly what the marketing presents, endlessly fun, at times hilarious, and a devilishly delightful thriller vibe throughout. Oh, and Samara Weaving is an absolute star in the making, and far better than Margot Robbie 1a, which is what I initially referred to her as.

The script and director successfully maintain a difficult but nicely paced movie along with an amazing absence of overly imbued supernatural features. Instead Ready or Not holds the audience attention more for its humanness than monsterness. The lead character played by Samara Weaving is allowed to perform with a more realistic and Hitchcockian motif using scary elements of timing, audience expectation, well-deserved cinematography, and music to create a technically well-crafted scary movie. For the most part, the movie is well-tied together with a compelling sprinkle of twists and delicious sordidness. Except for perhaps a tinge of the loss of the fun balance of darkness and comedy towards the last half of the movie, it still ends with a nice sense of humor",Ready or Not

33,paulclaassen,Fantastic! Absolutely brilliant.,7,1 January 2020,"Every once in a while a horror film comes along that blows me away. 'Ready or Not' is such a film. It's been a while since I've seen a horror film as satisfying (and as much fun) as this one.From the trailer, I expected a slapstick comedy horror, but this was not the case - thankfully. Although the film contains humor (that are actually funny and not slapstick), this was a nerve wrecking, suspenseful film that crawled in under my skin.Samara Weaving is FANTASTIC as Grace, the unsuspecting bride. The film might not have worked so well with another lead. She's the perfect lead for this film. 'Ready or Not' is a very different and refreshing take on the slasher genre. I also loved the setting in the big mansion. The film is wonderfully mysterious in the beginning and keeps you guessing until the finale. There's a few unexpected twists, as well. Insanely entertaining!",Ready or Not
34,cruise01,Bloody fun time and cheesy.,8,3 September 2019,"Ready or Not (4 out of 5 stars).Ready or Not is a bloody fun time with a cheesy concept idea and plot and some suspense and thrills. Kind of like a cheesy horror movie like Cabin in the Woods. A simple and weird plot idea. But throw in some cheesy script and direction which does make it entertaining. Ready or Not worked with the idea.The plot follows Grace (Samara Weaving) who got married to Alex (Mark O'Brien) whose family is rich and have an empire in the gaming business. The family has a weird tradition on the wedding night. Grace has to play a game and this mystery box tells them they have to play hide and seek. With a twist. She has to hide and the family has their set of weapons and they have to go hunting for her.There is a little more to plot that reveals the family true reasoning with the game. Which has a family history of a tradition that they have to do. There is a twist that gets very bloody in the climax. Literally from the characters getting stabbed to fighting back. Even bodies exploding. Feels like Quentin Tarantino idea of a movie.The movie moves at a fast pace. Grace is on the run and avoiding the family until dawn. Every encounter has her fighting for her life and avoiding danger. While the family is slowly losing control of their hunting game. Which they are very desperate in trying to get her before dawn. Before something else happens.The script is a bit cheesy with the acting and funny. The direction also delivers some thrills and suspense. Not really scary at all. Samara Weaving delivered a great performance. Probably the most freaked out performance of the year. Love how her character is wearing the bride dress throughout. Until, she gets worn down and messy and bloody while trying to survive. Adam Brody also delivered playing Daniel, which he is the brother in law who is tired from the family tradition.Overall, Ready or Not is a good thriller of a film. It delivers plenty of thrilling moments and some cheesy humor. It can be a bit bloody. The story is cheesy with its set up but at least it is fun.",Ready or Not
35,eddie_baggins,A star making film for Samara Weaving,6,27 January 2020,"One of 2019's most surprisingly decent films, directing duo Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillet graduate from small budget offerings and bit parts in anthology films like VHS and Southbound to create a fun, fast-paced and highly over the top genre offering, that makes a star of Aussie actress Samara Weaving in the process.With an extremely silly story at its core, filled with blood, violence and gore, Ready or Not isn't the type of film for refined cinematic tastes but Olpin and Gillet make sure that from the moment we are introduced to the Le Domas family, of whom Weaving's Grace is becoming a part of thanks to her marriage to their son Alex, we are aware that this is not a film to at all take seriously.By embracing its crazy concept, that sees the age old game of Hide and Seek take a murderous turn, Ready or Not is a fun ride for audiences from the moment it starts until the moment it explosively ends and while its disappointing it at times didn't utilize more energetic or unique ways to tell its story (perhaps rundowns on the mansion or more fun set pieces), it's a hard film to not enjoy, especially with Weaving creating her Hollywood breakthrough around all the crazed happenings.Weaving has been plying her trade locally and abroad for a number of years now but Ready or Not is her announcing herself to the industry in a big way, Grace is a likable and feisty main protagonist and Weaving uses her natural charisma and smarts to instill her with an engaging spirit.It's a turn not to dissimilar to fellow Aussie actress Margot Robbie made with her star making Wolf of Wall Street role, its likely the only way is up her for the budding superstar and in a genre sense, its not going to be surprising to see Grace become a real modern day horror icon as she finds herself in various situations trying to outlast the Le Domas's who believe wholeheartedly that if they don't kill Grace on games night, their all likely to meet a grizzly end.Front and centre to almost every scene in the film, even when Ready or Not's targeted humor or group of unlikable side characters don't exactly fully engage, Weaving makes sure we're always keen to see what's coming next.Final Say -A nice surprise in an otherwise fairly uneventful year for original horrors, Ready or Not is the perfect Saturday night movie treat and a likely launching off point for Samara Weaving to become the next big Australian export.3 dispatched servants out of 5",Ready or Not

Anyway, solid movie about a rich and crazy family with a peculiar tradition and good if you like horror comedies, and in my opinion more fun to watch as that overpraised Get Out from 2017.Note: in my opinion many of those 1 or 2 rating reviews are driven by ""agendas"", if you watched the movie you can guess why ;)",Ready or Not

39,matthewssilverhammer,Killer,9,30 August 2019,"Not since 2011's Cabin in the Woods has a horror comedy been this uniquely fun, cleverly written, and perfectly demented. And like Cabin..., it's not flawless; the direction certainly could use a defter touch, especially in the cinematography and scare controls (oddly, Wes Anderson came to mind as an interesting replacement). However, if the flaws are part of the package, a package that includes a wonderfully original script and pitch perfect performances, then like a good marriage, I'll take the better and the worse.
Like Get Out, it's a horror satire that presents one of our biggest fears: a worst-case-scenario for meeting the in-laws. On her wedding night, Grace (Weaving) is forced into a deadly game of hide-and-seek with her husband's family. The balance of tones and genres here is vital and difficult, but they hit the target at each turn, giving us a wonderfully absurd 70's grindhouse / Roger Corman picture for the modern day. Weaving is sensational and hilarious as the baddest bride since Uma Thurman hunted down Bill, and the cast of characters hunting her down are varied and often side-splittingly funny.
Underneath the entertainment heights, there is plenty of sharp satire bubbling up. The rich preying on the poor. Selling our souls for the almighty dollar. The trappings of our upbringing. The motivating power of all kinds of fear. The absurdity of religious certainty. Each of these elements packs a punch, but none of it would hit as hard if the movie weren't also an absolute blast. Ready or Not is easily one of my favorite films of the year, and I can't wait to watch it again and again.",Ready or Not

On her wedding night, as per family tradition she must play a game with the rest of the immediate family. Unfortunately for her, the game involves proving your worth to them by surviving a night of hide and seek, whilst the remaining family hunt her. And when I say hunt . . . .""Ready or Not"" wisely operates more like a broad black comedy, than any form of real horror film. Despite some moments of gore and violence, it's much better suited to being funny than it is scary. There is tension though, as Grace makes her way around the house, and thriller aspects as we try to determine exactly how far various family members are prepared to go to complete the game. Overall, it's not quite as fun as it occasionally threatens to be though. It's enjoyable enough, but perhaps lacking a little in consistency, and occasionally logic, to be considered top tier.Weaving is really good though, and carries the film on her shoulders with a likable and funny performance. She's much better than the ""budget Margo Robbie"" tag that may, unfortunately, put a ceiling on her career. Adam Brody is solid but his role is little more than cracking wise at various points. The rest of the cast too are a little underwhelming, different actors might have made them stand out a little more (I'm thinking along the lines of the characters in ""Knives Out"" - who share a resemblance with them).Casting and consistency issues aside, ""Ready or Not"" is a decent and enjoyable film.",Ready or Not

As the movie opens, we see two young boys running around in a large mansion, only to see a guy get shot by bow and arrow. Is it real? or just play? We then go to ""30 Years Later"", and we get to know Grace, who is rehearsing her wedding vows. She is set to marry Alex Le Domas, on of the boys we saw in the opening scene. After the wedding ceremony, Alex informs Grace that according to family tradition, they will play a game starting at midnight. By luck of the draw, Grace gets ""Hide and Seek""... At this point we are 10 min, into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this movie is directed by up-and-coming Matt Betinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett, who previously brought us ""Devil's Due"". Here they bring what turns out to be a traditional ""horror"" movie, albeit with a slightly black comedy twist. From the get-go it all appears so straight-forward, and hence I expected a major plot twist or some other significant departure from this tried-and-true genre. Alas, it didn't happen and hence I felt a bit let down: was this supposed to be scary? or funny? Bottom line is that it is neither. The movie benefits significantly from Australian actress Samara Weaving's breakout role as Grace. Surely we have not seen the last of her. Check out Andie McDowell (in the role of Alex's mother), who remains as lovely as ever. But other than that, this movie just felt average to me: not really bad, but nowhere near as good as, say, the similarly themed ""Get Out"".""Ready Or Not"" was released wide a few weeks ago, and now in its third weekend, I finally went to see it here in Cincinnati. The Saturday matinee screening where I saw this at was not attended well (6 people in total). This movie has been getting great reviews (it's currently rated 87% Certified Fresh on Rotten Tomatoes), and I must admit that I am a bit dumbfounded by that as for me there really was nothing special about this movie.

Horror movies are notorious for having terrible, bland, uninteresting dialogue, but the lines written for this film (and it does help that there are some very good actors delivering them to be fair) are superb. That sets the tone, and then the story takes over. I love how mysterious this movie is. You're always on edge because you feel like the film has more up its sleep than its showing you. This is a really well made horror movie.The cast of characters is just so great. There isn't a bland one amongst them. They all add something to the film and collectively make it so great. I would be remiss not to mention Samara Weaving in the main role. She is incredible. She is the horror character filmmakers dream of creating, because you can't help but root for her.Even though this was a great movie throughout, I couldn't help feeling the ending was going to play a large part in how people were going to feel about it.

It was also pretty cool seeing Andie McDowell as a villain.But other than that, I was just waiting for it to end. Even the movie's sub-par gore is predictable. What a surprise, for example, that the protagonist suffers a wound mid way, that would probably see her bleed to death within moments in real life... and then goes the rest of the movie with it without even fainting from loss of blood.The movie is born to be a thriller in the Agatha Christie mould but makes a final, misguided detour into horror movie territory in the final act, as though the filmmakers realised they needed to somehow justify the movie's ridiculous premise, and only the supernatural could really do that.It seems like it was made up as they went along, which makes it a waste of their time, as well as ours.",Ready or Not

The plot consists of a rich and powerful American family, one son's wedding, a deadly game of hide and seek, plus some Satanic rituals. There is quite a lot going on the 90 minutes or so, the film is well paced and never gets boring. This is a horror movie but is also labelled as a comedy, I think that the horror dominates but there is plenty of dark humour to be enjoyed. Good cast and well acted, Samara Weaving is particularly good as the unfortunate bride, one minute married into huge wealth, the next on the run for her life. The movie is rated 18 in the UK, there is a lot of bloody and brutal violence. Much of it is comical but it may prove too strong for some viewers. A cut above most modern horror movies, though that's not saying much, Ready or Not is well worth checking out, not a classic by any means but good, gory fun and quite original.",Ready or Not
49,dfranzen70,Best Hide and Seek champ since Bigfoot?,7,5 December 2019,"I realize that a lot of people have seen the more-recent Knives Out, which has a similar plot (rich people, big mansion, murder), but those similarities are superficial. Ready or Not is much more in the vein of You're Next, a family gathering gone awry, a horror movie with spots of comedic activity, and just as bloody. Here, Grace (Samara Weaving), having just married Alex (Mark O'Brien) at his super-rich family's super-big house, learns on her wedding night that she must play a game in order to be accepted into the family. The game is chosen through mystic randomness, and previous players have selected games like chess and Old Maid. Grace, though, gets Hide and Seek. Sounds like a fun game to play, especially in such a large building that's filled with tons of nooks, crannies, dumbwaiters, smart waiters, you name it. But it's not meant to be fun, as we soon find out - the family members, while Grace innocently hides, arm themselves with rifles, handguns, knives, and even a crossbow. How can she win? Grace wonders. Last until daylight, she's told. Good luck with that! The upsides of this movie far outweigh its main problem, that there's a real lack of chemistry between Weaving and O'Brien. The supporting cast is fine, but Andie McDowell, playing Alex's mother, is a real standout; it's a lot of fun to see the star of Groundhog Day and sex, lies, and videotape in a real horror movie, and she steals every scene with a commanding performance. And there's just enough humor to counteract some of the darker themes and scenes, particularly in the final act.",Ready or Not
50,stevendbeard,In-Laws From Hell,8,22 August 2019,"I saw ""Ready or Not"", starring Samara Weaving-Three Billboards Outside Ebbing,Missouri, Ash vs Evil_tv, Oh and if her name sounds familiar, it's because she is the niece of Hugo Weaving/Mr. Smith, from the Matrix movies; Adam Brody-Shazam!, The O.C._tv; Mark O'Brien-Bad Times at the El Royale, Arrival; Henry Czerny-Revenge_tv, Mission:Impossible and Andie MacDowell-Magic Mike XXL, Groundhog Day.
This is a bloody, funny tale about In_laws From Hell. Samara is a poor girl marrying Mark, a man that comes from a rich family-they made their fortune in games-but he forgets to tell her about a family tradition. At midnight, on their wedding night, his family welcomes a new person into their family by playing a game. They draw cards to see what they will play, it could be Checkers, Old Maid or in this case, Hide & Seek. Henry & Andie are Mark's parents and Adam is Mark's brother. Mark tells Samara that they should just elope-he can't tell her why because of his family and their rules-but Samara wants to be accepted by the family and decides to play the game. Henry tells Samara that the rules of the game are that she must stay hidden until dawn. Samara soon finds out that the game is being played seriously and they are really trying to kill her before dawn or there will be consequences for the seekers. Although it is violent and bloody, there are lots of humor in it, too. There aren't any scenes at the end but if you do stay, there is someone that says, 'Ready or not, here I come!' at the very end.
It's rated ""R"" for violence, bloody images, language and drug use and has a running time of 1 hour & 35 minutes.
I really enjoyed it and would buy it on Blu-Ray.",Ready or Not

55,kirbylee70-599-526179,THE MARRIAGE GAME,10,17 December 2019,"A number of movies that once qualified to be called thrillers now fall under the guise of horror films. These films have viewers on the edge of their seats waiting to see what will take place, filled with jumps and scares aplenty. What makes them horror films are the morbid things that take place in the film. READY OR NOT is such a film.Former foster child Grace (Samara Weaving) marries into the Le Domas family after a whirlwind 18 month romance with son Alex (Mark O'Brien). Alex has been estranged from his wealthy family for some time now. They return to the family home for their marriage and all seems to be going well. Until the evening of the wedding Grace learns of something unexpected.The Le Domas family has made their wealth from the gaming industry. Begun years ago by Victor le Domas, he was provided with funds to start the company by a mysterious benefactor named Le Bail. Victor left behind a mysterious box and a demand of his family. When someone marries into the family they must play a game, determined by a card that the draw from the box. After hearing the story Grace draws her card and the game chosen is hide and seek.Grace runs off to hide with no idea of what is actually about to transpire. The family believes that if they don't follow the game to its end something terrible will transpire. What they haven't bothered telling Grace is that this game of hide and seek involves hunting her with weapons, the object to kill her before sunrise. If she survives, things move forward.As Grace hides the family arm themselves with various weapons. For most of them this is something new they've never experienced. While some are skilled others have no clue how to use the weapons they've been given. This becomes apparent when one of the family members is killed by mistake.A change in the game takes place when Grace is located by her husband Alex. He tells her what is going on and explains to her the object of the game. With his help the pair are hoping to survive the night and move on to become a happy couple. But with the number of family members hunting the odds are not in their favor.The movie sounds like a simple plot but is filled with tons of things that make it worth watching, in particular the dark comedy that many of the sequences lend themselves to. In particular is Aunt Helene who has a scowl on her face from start to finish. She seems the most suited for the role of hunting and seems to take relish in what transpires. What she does to the help is guaranteed to provide a laugh for those with an offbeat sense of humor.Another funny moments has the family arguing about whether or not to use the security cameras seen throughout the house. The cameras are not to be used during the game but once the first person is killed they think twice about using them. Aunt Helene complains telling them they have no sense of tradition.The film has a wonderful look to it, a sort of brownish haze that adds to the atmosphere of the film. The sets are amazing with a fantastic looking old style mansion for the events to take place in. The cinematography is also extremely well done allowing scenes in the dark just enough light for things taking place to be seen, a problem with many movies that take place at night.The acting here is wonderful as well with each character turning in wonderful performances. To be able to play these roles with a straight face takes some acting chops. Perhaps outstanding among them is Henry Czerny as the head of the family. His ability to play his role as serious as he does while in the face of absurdity is hilarious. Samara Weaving as Grace is worthwhile too, showing the right amount of shock and resilience the role requires. And Andie McDowell is fantastic in the role of the mother here, a role that most would never expect her to play.READY OR NOT is not the type of movie that everyone will have fun with but if your sense of humor runs the dark side then this will be a movie not to miss. It's gruesome and funny at the same time and that for me is something that rarely works. This time it does.",Ready or Not
56,kluseba,Not ready,4,23 August 2019,"Ready or Not tries to be a mixture of a comedy and a horror movie and fails at both. The movie is never atmospheric, intense or scary enough to be a great horror movie. The film is never clever, surprising or vibrant enough to be an entertaining comedy movie. Even by poor b-movie standards, the story of this film is completely ridiculous in a way that it's almost insulting.If you were wondering why this film still deserves four points, the movie isn't entirely bad. The settings look great and especially the mansion where the sinister hide and seek game takes place is really gorgeous, including hidden hallways and elegant gardens. The movie features a few intense action scenes that make you root for the desperate lead character. The film has a fast pace and doesn't overstay its welcome with plodding storytelling. Lead actress Samara Weaving does her best with a poor script and has enough charisma to be the only great actress in this film.Ready or Not should be ignored since it's neither a gripping horror film nor a clever comedy. It's a shallow action film with a few gore elements. Movies like You're Next are similar in style but executed much better. The overtly positive reviews for Ready or Not show that expectations for horror movies have significantly decreased in an era of prequels, remakes, sequels and overall rehashed ideas. Refer to European or Asian cinema to find some creative horror movies these days.",Ready or Not

She chooses Hide & Seek. Soon she is fighting for her life.

59,jfgibson73,Most Dangerous Game,5,17 September 2019,"So they took a very old concept (1924) and made a modern suspense movie out of it. What I liked about this movie was that there was one character who we sympathize with, and a group of characters who we want to see die horribly. As opposed to a slasher movie, where you are supposed to be entertained by innocents getting painfully cut to death. As far as negatives, I just didn't find this movie to my taste. I liked the setup, but it never really felt like things got going. There was lots of killing, but the story seemed to falter. I wasn't too fond of the ending, either. As far as horror comedies go, I won't say to skip this one, but I don't see it becoming a classic either.",Ready or Not

I say could, because poor scripting sabotaged, what is a rather interesting premise.On the upside Ready or Not isn't a dismal film. The cast is well chosen, there's no issues with the acting and the back story is intriguing. The sets are good too and compliment the atmosphere of the film, which has something of a 1920's vibe.That said, this production fails to capitalise on all this wonderful potential. In my opinion this is largely because we never get to know the primary characters well enough to really have any genuine moments of dark humour. Instead, what you get is a very basic horror thriller, driven predominantly by exposition..A somewhat disinterested 5/10 from me.",Ready or Not
61,peterp-450-298716,This gothic horror/comedy was a fun trip.,7,17 December 2019,"So, at midnight you have to play a game.
It's just something we do when someone new joins the family.I have to revise my opinion about the horror/comedy cross-over urgently after seeing ""Monster Party"" and ""The dead don't die"" this year. ""Ready or not"" is yet another film that pleasantly surprised me. Really. I had a great time watching this movie. And not only because the lead actress Samara Weaving looks appetizing, but also because of the entertaining content. I appreciated the morbid black humor as well. It's not such absurd humor as in ""The dead don't die"". But the slapstick-like events that were used in it, resulted in a spontaneous chuckle sometimes. There were also quite a few bloody scenes in it. In short, it was fun watching this horror flick.And all because of playing an innocent game of ""hide and seek"". Grace (Samara Weaving) chose that on her wedding night by pulling a card out of a wooden box. Apparently, the Le Domas family, who made their fortune in the board gaming world, has a recurring family tradition at weddings. So the moment Grace got a wedding ring from Alex Le Domas (Mark O'Brien), her brand new husband, she unknowingly became part of this tradition. So instead of playing a game of hanky-panky and frolicking in the old-fashioned-looking four-poster bed, the wedding couple is requested to go to the family room to play an old-fashioned board game. What Grace doesn't realize is that there's one special card that can have far-reaching consequences for the rest of the evening. Guess what. Yep indeed, she draws the card in question.It was not only the course of the story I found enormously fascinating and ingenious. Also, the setting where it all took place was beautiful to see. A huge Victorian house, full of dark corners and niches. Such a huge villa that suits a wealthy family like Le Domas perfectly. Full of wood paneling, majestic staircases, and richly decorated corridors. As a child, you could easily get lost there. And that's where the innocent ""hide and seek"" takes place. At the beginning Grace enthusiastically participates. Until she realizes that nobody from the Le Domas family starts the countdown and starts shouting ""Ready or Not, Here I come"" (hence the film title). Instead, this insane family has armed itself with old, primitive weapons and starts hunting her.The most hilarious thing about the film is the family members themselves. All of them are cartoonish, caricatural characters. From the authoritarian somewhat empty-headed paterfamilias Tony (Henry Czerny) and his wife Becky (Andie MacDowell) to the scary-looking, shrewish aunt Helene (Nicky Guadagni). The latter is the most extreme character. She looks as if she's a member of a satanic cult with her purple suit, black nail polish and upright Cruella de Vil hairstyle. And when you see her running through the corridors, screaming frantically and waving with a huge lumberjack's ax, the picture is complete. Add a bunch of other family members to it, such as the alcoholic son Daniel (Adam Brody) and his cheeky wife Charity (Elyse Levesque). The coke-addicted daughter Emilie (Melanie Scrofano) and her cowardly husband Fitch (Kristian Bruun). And of course the butler should not be missing. Together they form a colorful ""Adam's Family"" -like collective.Finally something about the horror part. Even though the overall atmosphere is rather lighthearted and caricatural, the hardcore horror fanatic will enjoy certain moments. This gothic horror is filled with a few gory and bloody scenes while maintaining an exciting pace. I found the part in the barn particularly successful and at the same time extremely funny. You see the nail. You see the hole in a hand. And you immediately know how these two facts will be linked. Sublime. And even though you know where it's going, I was surprised by the denouement. A denouement that would make Quentin Tarantino jealous. And I suppose they wanted to show how huge the gap is between rich and poor. In the end, this was just a minor side issue. ""Ready or not"" is perhaps the cruel version of the Cinderella fairy tale. But ultimate entertainment was the main goal here. And they certainly have succeeded in that for me.More reviews here: movie-freak.be",Ready or Not
62,questl-18592,Ready or Not,7,26 August 2019,"First and foremost, I'd seen trailers for this movie that made it seem terribly mediocre and seemed like they were giving away the entire plot. Fortunately, neither was the case.Rather than just being a straight up slasher flick gore fest it was more reminiscent of films like Cabin in the Woods or Tucker and Dale vs Evil, taking the normal tropes and flipping them on their head in fun and exciting ways. Samara Weaving is wonderfully fun in the role and the rest of the cast rounds out the experienceUnfortunately, there are some pretty heavy logic jumps and errors that took me out of the film. Things that are common to horror movies but are still problematic to me but those issues were few and far between.Definitely worth checking out and the theater experience was great, just to hear everyone react to the things happening on screen. That aside, there's no huge action scenes or special effects that really warrant the big screen or give the impression that the home theater experience would be lacking something so there's no need to rush out and see it if you'd rather wait.",Ready or Not
63,aidanratesmovies,Quite an Enjoyable Surprise,10,23 February 2020,"Surprisingly smart, nimble, and by far an absolute blast- Ready or Not truly makes the best of its absurd premise, by not taking itself too seriously and finding a sheer sense of energy and balance between the humor and the chaos ensued. Samara Weaving leads a surprisingly great cast, with a performance that was absolutely perfect for the role involved. All other characters gave quite good performances as well, and to my surprise, none of their acting seemed too forced or taken too far. The script at times can prove to be a bit messy, but it is all in good fun, and by the time it is over, you will almost be impressed with the lengths it covered in such a short runtime. The pacing is quite good, and the cinematography is quite brilliant. For such a small budgeted film, you can't help but be blown away by the amount of quality involved in such a film. It simply shouldn't be and feel as it good as it is, and yet, it is true. Ready or Not is easily one of the best surprises of 2019, and proves that an absurd concept can be quite a good film, if having the right people involved.

64,truemythmedia,"Not Great, Not Terrible",6,6 December 2019,"If this movie would've come out ten years ago, it probably would've received a 4/5 Star rating from me, but as it is now I feel as if ""Ready or Not"" is a amalgamation of two or three better (and recent) horror-comedy films (primarily ""Get out"" and ""Cabin in the Woods""). That's not to say it's bad, in fact, there are a few moments that had me cackling, and a few other moments that sated my perpetual horror-fan bloodlust. As a whole, this movie is fine; just fine. The film sort of teetered on a 2.5 and 3 star rating for me throughout the whole of my viewing, but I was never bored, and Samara Weaving really gave it her all, so I honestly wouldn't say its a waste of your time.

66,Reviews_of_the_Dead,Fun Film that Explores some Relevant Material,9,23 August 2019,"This was a film that I was excited to check out as I caught part of the trailer. When I saw that it starred Samara Weaving that was when I knew I was on-board. The concept was something that had me intrigued as well. I hadn't seen this since the theater and am now giving it a second viewing as part of the Summer Series for the Podcast Under the Stairs. The synopsis is a bride's wedding night takes a sinister turn when her eccentric new in-laws force her to take part in a terrifying game.We start this film off with two little kids running away from someone. They are Daniel and Alex. Daniel has his brother hide in a closet and when he turns, a man asks for his help. He yells for others to come and when they do, the man is shot with arrows. He's then taken away while a woman named Helene breaks down.The film then alerts us that we shifting 30 years into the present. It is the wedding day of Grace (Weaving) to Alex Le Domas (Mark O'Brien). The Le Domas are a rich family that made their fortune off of board games. Daniel (Adam Brody) is an alcoholic, but still fairly close to his brother.Grace is scared the family doesn't like her, because of how rich and snooty they are. We get to know them through the pictures before the ceremony. The father is Tony (Henry Czerny) and he's married to Becky (Andie MacDowell). Daniel is married to Emilie (Melanie Scrofano) and they really don't get along. There's also Aunt Helene (Nicky Guadagni) who keeps giving Grace the evil eye.As the night progresses, Alex finally reveals to his new bride that at midnight they are required to play a game. It is family tradition. Showing up just in time is Alex's sister Charity (Elyse Levesque) and her husband, Fitch (Kristian Bruun) with their two kids. They go into a room reserved for family only. There's a box that will decide the game they have to play that night. You can guess what it is from the title of the film. Grace doesn't take it too seriously, but her in-laws do. She has to survive until dawn, but they have a lot riding on her not making it.That should be enough of a recap without spoiling anything. I want to start this off by stating that this is a fun film. I had a blast with this one and it is actually quite hilarious. To be honest though, as the film progresses, I did see some deeper things here that I really enjoyed as well. Regardless, this is a fun, popcorn horror movie that doesn't shy away from the violence and the gore.The first of which to cover is the symbolism of Grace vs. The Le Domas. She is wearing a white wedding dress and they're wearing mostly dark clothes. I took this as she is good and them being the evil. It is even more interesting in this idea as some things get revealed as to why they have to play this game and what they think will happen if they don't complete what they need to do. I also like that she is wounded and her dress gets dirtier, she becomes stronger in fighting back. It is showing that change that comes over her as she grows harder.As it went on, I also picked up the idea of old traditions against the new ways of life. The Le Domas are old money. I like the idea how they earned it and they are trying to adhere to the rules of the game. The problem is that as it goes on, they get scared. They want to break tradition for the sake of winning. I thought this is a fitting look at the rich, who tend to bend the laws for their own gain. Going from there though, Alex is torn between protecting his new wife and the life that they could be making for themselves and his duty to his family. It is funny how inept this family is at hunting her. It definitely sounds like it was much easier as the ancestors were actually hunters. The deeper the generations go, the less skilled they are due to their easier upbringing.I do have to admit there is something that happened late in the film I could have done without after my first viewing. After listening to others talk about it and now giving it a second viewing, I don't have my issues there. It makes sense for what the movie is building to and that fear of what could happen if they fail.The pacing of the film though is something that is good as well. The film really just gets right into introducing the characters and getting to the game within the first half hour or so. I do like that we see a gradual change in Grace as she has to go to greater and greater lengths of surviving. There wasn't anything in the film that really bogged it down for me and I had fun all the way through.Something that was really good here was the acting. On a podcast I heard them compare Weaving to the horror Margot Robbie and I love this comparison. She is such a beautiful woman, but she is an amazing actress as well. I love how quirky her character is and she gives off that vibe that she is down to Earth without realizing how good looking she is. I love the change in her character as things happen to her. Brody is good here as well. There is an issue I have after this viewing with decisions this character makes. It feels like it is there to push the movie and doesn't make sense. Much like O'Brien, who is fine in his role, they're dealing with keeping up with traditional or finally breaking it to move on. I thought the rest of the family and staff was fitting for what was needed, they definitely rounded out the film and they all kind of bring their own humor to their specific roles.As for the effects of the film, I think there was some CGI, but to be honest I was stoked to see that they went practical. This film can be quite brutal at times and there are some things that Grace goes through that had me cringing. The CGI that was used looked good to me and I didn't notice it. There was good amount of blood and gore for me, so no complaints. The film is also shot very well as it does do some interesting angles so credit to the cinematography.The last thing to cover would be the soundtrack of the film, which I have to admit didn't really stand out. It did fit the scenes for what was needed and it helped to build tension. The only time I remember it was when they play this 'Hide and Seek' song. It is an old timey one and was quite eerie if I'm honest. I might see if I can find it actually. Regardless, I like the vibe that song gives.Now with that said, this film is definitely a fun one. I heard that, but I like to check things out for myself and it didn't disappoint. I thought it had an interesting concept, by taking a children's game and turning it deadly. I like the social commentary we are getting here and how it is plausible a family like this could get away with it. It is paced well, it built tension and I never got bored. I thought the acting from Weaving was good while the rest definitely rounded out the film for what is needed. Even the comedy worked for me as it doesn't take anything away from the movie or the tension. The effects were great, both the practical and the CGI. The soundtrack didn't stand out aside from one song, but I don't have a lot of complaints either. I'm not always the biggest horror/comedy fan, but there was something about this one that I liked. I thought this was good, bordering on being great for me.My Rating: 8.5 out of 10.",Ready or Not

69,jadepietro,The Party's Over,3,4 September 2019,"GRADE: D+THIS FILM IS NOT RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: This newlywed game is an awful horror film that dispatches its dark comedy origins more quickly than its bloody victims.JIM'S REVIEW: Summer 2019 was the bleakest of times...hurricanes destroying the lives of many survivors, mass shootings with no gun regulation in sight, a roller-coaster of a economy due to unnecessary trade wars, an unhinged president...and one of the most disappointing movie roster to ever (dis)grace the tarnishing silver screen. Take your pick, which was the worst...all were bad news. Let us beg the gods above that September brings with it an autumnal bounty of good news.That said, my first fall film experience is Ready or Not, a slice-and dice horror send-up about the trials and tribulations of matrimonial bliss when one is confronted with in-laws whose sole purpose is to play a game I would like to called Kill the Bride. This wealthy family has a tradition of playing games like hide-and-seek on one's wedding night to welcome the newest member to the family. So let the games begin, of course, at the stroke of midnight.Yes, you might say that the premise is very far-fetched and ludicrous. You could say that I knew what I was about to see from the trailer. And I would wholeheartedly agree with your statements. But my hopes as a reviewer were still high, if a bit naive as our plucky heroine, that this strange little movie might have a sharp (literally) comic edge about its satirical subject, playing up the dark humor and downplaying the gore. No. Instead it was just a very bloody version of Clue with various killings and assorted weapons used by deranged members of this dysfunctional family in the conservatory or in the dining room. (Everyone, of course, has the poorest of aim, little vision, or any semblance of reality or character development. And now, I'm talking about the directors and its screenwriters. Let's place the blame directly at them: Directors Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillert never find the right tone in this macabre mishmash and writers Guy Busick and Ryan Murphy only celebrate predictability with their contrived concept and just cannot create believable characters or clever dialog. The twist ending is more absurd than expected and a real letdown.)The actors range from deserving of better material to find another job ASAP. Samara Weaving (a Margot Robbie wannabe) plays Grace, the woeful bride. At least, this actress has some screen presence as does Mark O'Brien as Alex, the hapless groom. One actually pities this talented actors who deserve a better way to make a living, As Alex's brother, David, Adam Brody has his moments but is rather bland. From there, it gets worse: Henry Czerny, usually a fine character actor, is at his hammiest and has done far better work than this shlock suggests. That Andie MacDowell is part of this misfire only adds to the disappointment and confirms that what happens to actresses in their elder years does indeed qualify for elder abuse. Granted, the script is a mess and it is difficult to tell if it is the fault of the actors or the badly-written characters they play.The rest of the supporting cast is ghastly in their roles and they appear to come off as strictly amateurs in this movie. They all seem to be directed to perform like a live action Addams Family knock-offs without the make-up or wit, although Nicky Guadagni as Aunt Helene is cartoonish enough. (Some advice to all of the the ensemble: Your dedication to your craft is admirable. But, perhaps, your desperation to be a part of this biz we call show outweighs your better judgement. Ask yourself if you really want a film like this to be part of your legacy when doing your next venture. Plus, find a better agent.)For the record, Grace's white wedding gown turns a nice shade of deep crimson by the film's third act, if you care by then. (And those final scenes are unintentional laughable as the film veers into supernatural territory.) The body count continues to rise as servants and kin are dispatched with glee. The violence ranges from stabbings, impalements, beheadings, and gruesome shootings. The weapons include axes, cross-bows, rifles, pistols, and knives.How this movie merited some critical praise (and it did) is baffling! The suspense is nil, with nary a scare or a laugh, although the directors have an obsession for close-up gore and torture, believing that blood-drenched corpses gurgling their last gasps of life constitutes a horror film nowadays. Need I say more.Ready or Not is more not than ready. No RSVP is needed. Just avoid this wedding party at all costs.Ah, Autumn! Have you already forsaken me!",Ready or Not

71,rgkarim,Do You Hide From This Film Or Seek It Out,7,21 August 2019,"Robbie K back in the trenches for another movie review, this time looking at yet another horror movie to hopefully bring with a number of warped imaginations to life. Some of them bring us into the disturbing zone and leave us scarred, others manage to be quirky cult thrillers that lead to endless sequels, and others are so bad they somehow stay good. Tonight, the horror movie looks to be a hybrid of a thriller meeting said horror, with promise of being a romping good time. Yet, the trailers can certainly be a mask for something else. Read on to check out my thoughts on:Movie: Ready or Not (2019)Directors:

The Ending Sort Of
Focus On Blood at timesSummary:We get that these types of movies often do not have the best acting, but in this film the cast actually brings some effort into making believable characters that aren't too annoying. My lead is Samara Weaving who has the comical role down, but Adam Brody is a solid second actor to craft the believable brother struggling to handle the situation before them. As the rest of the cast plays essentially sadistic players in the mad games of chance, these carbon copy roles are all about trying to bring the suspense factor to the movie. Ready Or Not achieves the suspense decently, keeping a nice pace to keep the action going and the horrors at least coming. Thus, the thriller aspect is very well achieved in this movie. Yet, another element that I liked was the quirkiness of this film, primarily in the form of the presentation. Ready or Not is one of those movies that manages to find a stride with the cheesy gimmicks, putting a comedic spin on things without being too forced in your face. Perhaps it's the subtle comedy of the overzealous aunt, the clumsiness of the sister, or maybe just the reactions of the main character Grace, but there is something in the writing and presentation that makes it just fun. As an added bonus, the film also manages to achieve pretty close what the trailer provides, leaving some surprises to enjoy, and yet still not diverging down the pathways it could have taken.In regards to dislikes, the predictability of the movie is okay, some parts due to the trailers and other parts laid out in writing with heavy foreshadowing. This predictability not only ruins some of the surprise, but it also diminished the horror element of the movie as well. Ready Or Not's thriller is the selling point, for the jump scares are few, the creep factor is low, and there are seldom any moments that had me on the edge of my seat. This could also be due to the comical side of things and the fact they focused so much on the ridiculousness of the plot to help tone down the creep and scare factor. Maybe taking things the silly route wasn't the best route for this one, especially giving the ending, which to me is a mixed like and dislike. On the one hand the ending falls in line with the silliness of the movie and sort of just naturally occurs leaving you satisfied. On the other hand, the movie's ending led to not quite getting the hunt fest I had thought I was going to see. Like the most dangerous game or a final destination I had kind of thought members of this household would have altercations that were do or die. Yet as you will see, this in not quite the case and there is little more I can say without ruining anything so onward we move. My final component is the gore factor of this movie. Certainly not the worst thing, Ready Or Not does sometimes get a little too fixated on the blood factor for my tastes. Those who aren't fans of seeing suffering, skin crawling spectacles of crimson colored chaos need to turn away, as there are some gut-wrenching moments that aren't for the faint hearted.Overall, the adventure of Ready Or Not is a fun little project that is campy, quirky, and still thrilling in the world of horror films. With an engaging cast and concept, it's a movie that will keep the audience hooked and perhaps make them laugh at the odd sense of comedy and justice that they brought in this film. And though it matches the tone of the trailers, at times the comedy may have diluted the thriller anticipation you might have though. For the hunt sort of gets caught up in the blood and comedy rather than delivering the full-on horror chills. Still, the film is a fun watch and probably good for a small group to hit the theaters with or watch at home.My scores are:Horror/Mystery/Thriller: 7.5
Movie Overall: 6.0",Ready or Not
72,Kamurai25,"""Duck, Duck, Dead""",8,28 July 2020,"Fantastic watch, will watch again, and do recommend.This is such a great crazy, survivalist premise: an average lady that just wants to marry her man gets served up into a human hunting game, and she's a bad ass. Samara Weaving nails every aspect of this role. I did recognize a couple other actors: Melanie Scrofano (Wyanna Earp), Adam Brody, and Andie MacDowell, but none of the family really stands out other than Melanie, and that is more of circumstance, but they put the right person in that role at least.The setting is limited to the estate grounds, but even if they built the sets for that place, it is bloody amazing and lends to the visuals both when they're displaying the house as being expansion and when they're showing it as a trap.I'm actually short on words to why it is as good as it is, the writing is top notch and the set it great, but the acting is only good (other than Samara), and there aren't huge effects. Maybe it's the subtly of the effects they do show, and the details they go into in both presentation of the scene and the chosen dialogue. This movie definitely creates a permeable atmosphere for the audience.If you're okay with blood / gore / violence, then give it a go, it should be a good time.",Ready or Not

74,vengeance20,The Purge Meets Downton Abbey,9,2 September 2019,"Just seen this tonight at a Scream Unseen event at my local cinema & found it an epic watch!The films story-line is simple. A young woman, Grace, marry s into a rich family who have an annual tradition in which any new family member must play a game at midnight in order to seal the deal in a sense. But Grace picks that one game, Hide & Seek, she at first laughs & plays along but then soon realises its not the typical innocent game she thought it was. The rest of the film sees Grace in a fight for survival as she becomes caught in a deadly game of cat & mouse.I already knew what the film was going be like story-line wise, the trailer gives that away in the first 20 seconds alone. But what the twist of the film was going to be & how violent, was yet to be seen!It's rare in cinema now that you get an 18+ at all, never mind an 18+ horror! This film didn't disappoint & kept me locked from start to finish! The gore & kills were epic & didn't cease to amaze me! The humour was funny too, though I wouldn't say there was enough in it to justify the ""Black Comedy"" genre as it was mostly serious than anything else.The ending however though gory was a little half & half, but you'll have to see for yourself in order to know where I'm coming from with that one...!But overall this film was a nice 100 minute gory fest that reminds me of The Purge mixed with Downton Abbey! 9/10",Ready or Not
75,fntstcplnt,Ready or Not (2019),7,28 August 2019,"Directed by Matt Bettinelli-Olpen & Tyler Gillett. Starring Samara Weaving, Mark O'Brien, Adam Brody, Henry Czerny, Andie MacDowell, Nicky Guadagni, Elyse Levesque, Melanie Scrofano, Kristian Bruun, John Ralston, Hanneke Talbot. (R)Weaving marries into the fabulously wealthy Le Domas clan, unaware of their unusual tradition of playing a game after each family wedding; the game this time is hide-or-seek, and these upper class rapscallions play for keeps. Delicious black comedy disguised as a horror movie has lots of devilish laughs and plentiful bloodletting; not quite as clever as one might hope, and the chase is more fitful than fluid (almost like one of the board games that made the family its fortune), but it's still good, grisly fun all the way with some sly potshots at class and heritage. The groom (O'Brien) has the personality of wallpaper (the absence of relationship chemistry between him and his new bride is unfortunate) and Brody's conflicted drunk can be a buzzkill as often as a laconic wag, but the rest of the sordid family each have their share of wicked (and wickedly funny) moments; the deadliest weapon brandished onscreen is Guadagni's hysterically withering glare. Weaving, however, steals the show as the most memorable bride-on-the-brink since Uma Thurman in ""Kill Bill""; based on the evidence here, she's a star in the making. The audacious climax is a high-wire act that could have easily turned disastrous; it may not completely stick the landing, but one has to admire its macabre moxie.75/100",Ready or Not
76,Foutainoflife,6 Stars From Me,6,23 November 2019,"A woman marries into a wealthy family who has a customary game they play with whomever marries into the family. Some games are simple and easy and others, well, they aren't.I liked this for the most part. I like the concept of having to survive your in-laws on the night of the wedding and the framing for the story was ok. This took a turn the deeper into the movie we went. Actually it was the last 20 minutes or so. It felt like the film sorta morphed into something it hadn't started out to be and lost what it had going for it.I wouldn't say it is an awful film. I liked it, as I said, for the most part. I wished the ending would have gone in a different direction and I would liked to have seen more realism in the kills.",Ready or Not
77,Abdulxoxo,I came looking for Copper and I found Gold,8,14 January 2021,"From the trailer I thought this film looked tedious, kinda B-ish with poor acting but gladly I was wrong. Ready or Not is a decent thriller flick, and it manages to cross genres to great effect. There are action sequences, horror sequences and even some black humour. I felt tense when I was meant to. I wriggled at all the gory scenes when I meant to. Hell, I was even laughing at the dark humour, which I'm sure will not appeal to everyone. The way the screenplay sets up how and why this family is trying to kill Grace is actually really well thought out. This is a bloody, violent movie with some hilarious swearing; and I like that they didn't hold anything back.
The production design on this movie is superb. The look of the mansion and all the old weaponry work really well. The lighting is also fantastic. In addition I like the score. it has that rhythm that helps add tension to a horror movie, but in a way it also sounds sort of playful, like the children's game they are playing. In terms of the acting, everyone across the board does a great job. Samara Weaving is excellent in the lead role. Pretty much every member of the Le Domas family has a distinct personality and give a fun performance. Adam Brody's lack of interest is a constant highlight. Scrofano is there for the slapstick humour. Guadagni is just plain old scary. Her look, as well as attitude to family tradition, is just terrifying. Overall, this film is very entertaining and thrilling, and I had a good time watching it.",Ready or Not
78,arungeorge13,Surprisingly (a lot) more entertaining than I thought it'd be! [+64%],6,1 December 2019,"It'd been a while since I've sat down to watch a comedy-horror flick and when Ready or Not caught my attention, I was sure to give it a go. That said, I wasn't particularly fond of the director duo's earlier work - Devil's Due, and a segment (or was it two?) in Southbound and V.H.S. But the genre continues to intrigue me and that was the reason I decided to watch Ready or Not.For starters, my decision turned out to be a great one. Not only does Ready or Not manage to entertain for a good 95 minutes, but it also serves fair justice to the comedy-horror fanbase. Led by a fantastic Samara Weaving (playing Grace, who's just married and brought to her husband's house to partake in a rather uncanny midnight ritual) and a fantastic supporting cast (featuring the likes of Adam Brody, Henry Czerny, Andie MacDowell, and more), Ready or Not offers an engaging mix of dark humor and survival-horror.The storyline isn't the most original one you'll come across for a film such as this. Yet, the director-duo pack in enough twists and tricks to keep viewers engrossed throughout its run-time. The (another-level) dysfunctional family was both fun and creepy in their own ways. Weaving is in top form here, conveying the transition from yaay-just-married-bliss to straight-up-shocked in convincing fashion. I liked her (mostly improv) reactions in the latter half of the movie where she has to fend for herself while in an incredible amount of pain. Adam Brody is pretty great too, and thankfully, he doesn't take the thunder away from Weaving in any of their combination scenes.The mansion and its surroundings could have been creepier (the lighting is excellent and works in favor of the film's overall tone) but otherwise, I'd deem them okayish. The edits are crisp and that helps for a film which is set in a limited setting and the entire storyline is basically a one-liner. What works in Ready or Not lies in its execution of a concept that's low-hanging fruit these days: commonplace scenarios turning wacky all of a sudden, the one-too-many jabs at rich people and the extremes that they resort to, and a lady (in distress) at the forefront of it all.In essence, it may seem like the R-rated version of The Hunger Games with a few funny lines and situations thrown in, but Ready or Not gets the job done in amusing its viewers and sometimes, that's just about enough.",Ready or Not

The movie is tongue and cheek and is filled with gags both creepy and hilarious. The lead performance from Samara Weaving, so great in Netflix's the Babysitter is truly a thrilling, layered portrait.

She must play a game with them. Unfortunately, she has to play 'hide and seek' She has to hide while his family finds her. She has until dawn. Soon enough, she realizes that it's not just a game, they all mean to kill her!Throughout the night, Grace tries to survive by any means necessary. She even turns the tables and starts fighting back.

86,hnt_dnl,Uneasy mixture of comedy and horror,2,25 March 2021,"Based on the promos, READY OR NOT (2019) seemed like a promising and unique entry into the horror genre, but it fails is opting to infuse too much off-base humor into the story. I think this film would have worked much better as a purely serious piece. In fact, the movie feels way more like a comedy than it does a horror film. There are too many ""funny"" lines and silly characters that really take me out of the action. Whoever cast this did an awful job. The acting for the most part is really terrible. The only 2 actors who gave strong performances were Adam Brody and Mark O'Brien as brothers Daniel and Alex. Both of these actors managed to deliver persuasive dramatic performances in spite of the murky comedy that permeated the film. Every other actor in this film embarrassed themselves, including the main one. Samara Weaving's performance as the protagonist Grace was terrible, feeling very unauthentic. The movie started out with these cloying, cliche pre-wedding scenes that put me off of her personality from the get go to the point I was rooting for the family. I didn't buy the character's transition to finding out about the ritual because the acting was so insincere. Her way of showing horror and fear was through annoying bug-eyed facial expressions, histrionic heavy breathing, and stupid one-liners. I had a hard time rooting for this character's survival when all of her victories felt like the result of stupid antagonists and dumb luck. And her grating personality didn't help. Then there was the supporting cast. There were forgettable characters like Fitch, the cliche buffoonish son-in-law whom everyone hates, and Charity, the cliche vapid gold-digging daughter-in-law. Then there was this dumb butler character who spent the bulk of his dialogue humming and whistling to the sound of overly loud opera music in the background. Then you have veteran actors like Henry Czerny and Andie McDowell stuck in thankless roles. But the absolute worst characters were Emilie and Aunt Helene. These 2 actresses were horrible. Then you had these 3 bimbo maid characters played by fashion model ""actresses.""In addition to the questionable dialogue and acting, the film has a ton of plot holes. (1) If the whole point of the hide and seek game was that Grace was to be captured alive and sacrificed at dawn, why did the family keep trying to kill her through the night with deadly weapons? Why didn't they all the rules of this game that's been in their family for generations? (2) Why were they all so inept at this game? You'd think they would all be experts at handling their respective weapons. If you know that you might have to play this ""game"" then you would think the family would train and be ready when the time comes. (3) Regardless of lack of practice, how did they keep missing Grace when she was right in front of them? Several times a character would have Grace in their sights and not only would they miss, but also would have a second chance and let Grace jump them. One lady has the fortitude to shoot her own husband without hesitation, but yet she freezes when she has ample time to shoot Grace, a stranger and the actual prey. How did this strong butler manage to let the 90-lb Grace overpower him THREE different times? How does a blow from a coffee cup somehow damage the whole left side of his face. (4) Why does the father tell his sister that he doesn't believe in the ghost of the game's founder, yet he's the one who knows the precise details, rules, and history of the ritual and tells the family they have to follow it to the letter or else suffer the consequences? (5) Why does Alex just flip on Grace at the last second for seemingly no reason? Throughout the film he was fully determined to save her and was shown to hate this game and it's rules as much as Daniel did. Finally, the editing and pacing of this film is terrible. Grace would just magically appear in the exact spot she needed to be at so she could overhear conversations between characters that served as pure exposition. Why are these characters spending time having full on, deep seated conversations airing out their grievances with each other when they know that time is of the essence and they must find Grace so they all won't get sacrificed to the ritual at dawn? In this huge mansion, why are characters in such close proximity that when one calls out, the others make it to that exact spot within like 1 minute? Why aren't they spread out to make it quicker and easier to catch Grace? Virtually all of them are bigger and stronger than her and they have weapons and she doesn't. When the father asks how is Grace picking them apart one by one, my answer was because of the dumb script. But then this isn't the first time that an action hero has defeated the bad guys through sheer luck and stupidity. I'm actually a fan of horror films, but lost faith in the comedy genre a long time ago. And since this film leans very heavily on the latter and very little on the former, that pretty much sums up why it didn't work for me since modern comedies are pretty much terrible.",Ready or Not

No biggie.
Except as you have probably surmised from the movie poster it is not going to be a fun game.This has a lot of what you would expect: running around lofty corridors, sneaking through the spaces in the walls, hiding in kitchen cupboards and some gore that will make you wince.The film has a very witty dark humour running through it.
Inappropriate quips are made as the family members and servants are reduced to bloody pulp.What really makes this film is the lead character.
A very fine balance is maintained between her being a determined protagonist and a human being.
It is nice to see a lead character actually show a modicum of fear and distress when someone runs at them with an axe.
Samara Weaving has an awful lot piled on her shoulders and she carries it very well.
The rest of the family are also excellent and add comic relief and drama.Production and camera work is all top notch without being too extravagant.

It's not a ""The Purge"" imitation (whether that's a movie good enough to imitate or not, is another discussion), with all the horror aspects from that franchise and the social commentary, nor is a horror comedy committed 100% to the humor. It's a mix that doesn't work at all, with a bunch of boring ""jokes"" (mostly exaggerated reactions from the characters to the crazy premise), but also a failed attempt to build tension for the horror scenes. The gore is always used for a joke, making the movie a bit bland, actually. And the protagonist plays it straight, so the humor disappears when she's in the scenes (for the most part). So the tone is all over the place.The story told is quite ridiculous, shallow and boring, without any twist to make it more interesting.In the end, if you laugh at the humor, you could probably enjoy this movie as a horror/comedy.

Once the games begin, they make sure to keep the hits coming. In Samara Weaving, a star is born, again. She's horror's next big scream queen. No really, she's got an EPIC shriek. For a lack of better phrasing. Just as fun to watch is Henry Cherny as the wildly over-the-top Le Domas patriarch.

It looked like it could be an extravagant little affair but at the same time looked like a film that could be awfully disappointing. By now, you know me and know that I don't turn down seeing any film and will watch pretty much anything. Ready or Not was no exception. I did enjoy the theme and gory cat and mouse for the most part in this film although the film does drag itself down when it tries to delve too much into its characters.The film is about a recently married couple, where the bride is spending the wedding night with her husbands mysterious but rich family. The family proposes to honor an age old tradition and play a game where the bride draws a card and they fulfill the game. She draws ""hide and seek"" which turns out to be a bloody, murderous game where the bride must hide as members of her in law family try to murder her before dawn to avoid a curse that will occur to them.The film delivers on its dark humor, gothic mansion setting, and humor here and there which is great because its what the film needs. Samara Weaving is a star in the making and I'm all for it. She is a character you back to escape and she really gets into the element that the role requires. The film brings a good amount of blood and violence which will satisfy those looking for an entertaining thriller. The film does spend too much time trying to have moments of ""emotion"" between characters and its winded and feels like it.The film becomes utterly ridiculous as it goes along but its hard to look away. Its a different type of film and I had a pretty good time with it which is all I could hope for from a B movie that only exists to be humorous, violent fun.

93,RforFilm,"1, 2, 3, 4, 5, Ready or Not is a fun game of dark comedy and family secrets",7,29 August 2019,"We've all probably have gone to someone's game night party. I myself have a group that usually hosts one every couple of months, where we'll play ""Cards Against Humanity"" and ""Exploding Kittens"", but the point of it is to have fun while catching up with everyone's lives. It's that little bit of social interaction that makes life fun and fulfilling. Otherwise, then why would we play games? It's all a fun escape from whatever problems we have. While I don't play as much with my family, I have a good time with cards or puzzles or whatever they breakout.In the spirit of today's movie, the name of the game is hide and seek. This is something that I haven't played since I was in middle school (okay, I did play this with my little cousins not long ago), but it's something that kids love to play as it's as simple as the name; just hide and hope not to be found. But when it comes to creativity, we now have a story that's made it into a thriller...and also a dark comedy. Ready or Not makes Hide and Seek not only a deadly game, but a necessity to live for one family.Grace (played by Samara Weaving) is a young woman whose about to marry Alex Le Domas (played by Mark O'Brian), who happens to be a part of an incredibly wealthy family who've made their fortune in cards and board games...a gaming empire if that's what you call it. Alex has been estranged from the family for a while and Grace is hoping to find love within this eccentric, but not crazy family. Even the parents Tony (played by Henry Czerny) and Becky (played by Andie MacDowell) seem to be ready for a new member as it's been a while since someone's married into the family.After the ceremony and party, the family invites Grace down into the parlor where they explain the wedding tradition; that they play a random game drawn from a card machine. She happens to draw ""hide and seek"" and she goes off to hide while the family gathers weapons. When one of the members accidently shoots a maid, Alex admits that he knew about the tradition and is going to help her survive the night. He also reveals the family believes if they make a ritual sacrifice, then they won't violate their ancestors pact with the devil.As far as dark comedies go, Ready or Not is a great example of the genre. It manages to be both thrilling and got a lot of laughs. I don't think I can call this a satire, but it is self aware of it's ridiculousness of a plot and recognizes that a lot of super wealthy people have probably never fired a weapon, let lone kill someone. Is this a slam against rich people? I'd for those tied to old money, then yes. It does a great job making fun of those that want to remain wealthy, but are so stupid as people that their willing to go dark places to stay that way.What I loves about the story is how much about the family we get know about; the parents, the siblings and their significant others, the children's children and even the staff. This is a movie that clearly had a lot of backstory developed for a loopy family, even though were probably only shown forty percent of it. The ironic thing is that we don't get much of a chance to know Grace, the main character. Don't get me wrong; she's still likable and I wanted to see her survive, but she's more of blank that we, the audience fills, as we sit and witness this night.I also realized that what I like about the movie was that it's a rare story about idiots...privileged idiots at best. In fact, this would make a good companion movie to the underground thriller Murder Party. Both are about the same in entertainment value in which while I had fun, though I don't know if it's game changing. It's a short, but memorable chase...exactly like the hide and seek games you played as children.I'll give this seven playing cards out of ten. Ready or Not is definitely not for the faint of heart. It's funny, but it still has its dark and very bloody moments (especially at the end in which I won't spoil). I still recommend it for the crowd that does want scare. But I also see it for people that love dark comedies. Take your turn and go see it.",Ready or Not
94,Anurag-Shetty,Insane fun.,8,15 September 2019,"Ready or Not tells the story of Grace(Samara Weaving). After getting married, Grace's wedding night takes a malevolent turn, when her in-laws force her to take part in a horrifying game.Ready or Not is a highly entertaining film. Directors Matt Bettinelli-Olpin & Tyler Gillett have perfectly blended comedy with thriller & horror elements. The tense atmosphere has been maintained throughout, despite all the comedy. The performances are the highlight of the movie. Samara Weaving is the star of the show as Grace. Weaving gives us the performance of a lifetime, as the lead character. Adam Brody is spectacular as Daniel Le Domas. Mark O'Brien is outstanding as Alex Le Domas. Henry Czerny is brilliant as Tony Le Domas. Andie MacDowell is superb as Becky Le Domas. Melanie Scrofano is excellent as Emilie. Kristian Bruun is hilarious as Fitch Bradley. Nicky Guadagni is fantastic as Aunt Helene. Elyse Levesque is great as Charity Le Domas. The supporting cast is impressive. Ready or Not is worth a watch for horror/thriller/comedy fans. This film is definitely one of a kind, in many ways.",Ready or Not

98,kuarinofu,The film died 25 minutes in,5,2 May 2020,"This film is a lot of different pieces and ideas that are hard to combine, but they never seem to try anyway (or failed).After a promising and fun start, the film just dies 25 minutes in. ""Ready or Not"" is not even close to being called horror, but it is sort of a comedy, not a particularly funny one though (maybe it is under influence). Goofy and funny inserts into an intense story can work if the film itself is taking everything that is happening with maximum seriousness (Joker is a great example of that), and this is not the case here.After we are quickly introduced to what is supposed to be going on, the film just shifts scenes, from weird social commentary to family drama, then goofy comedy, then tense hiding scenes. You'd think that the characters would get interesting twists and some personality to each of them, but no. They are mostly bored and they often contradict themselves and completely change their attitude multiple times.I've seen many reviews stating that this is original, but it's not. The bride as a character and her ""rebel"" look to contrast a rich ""blue blood"" family is super cliche, even seen ""REC 3: Genesis""? Weird family plays and kills each other? Even seen ""You're Next""? Satirical gorefest about rich and working people not understanding each other? Ever seen ""The Hunt"" (even though this is a later film)?I mean, I'm not sure what am I supposed to be impressed here. The film got tedious and repetitive after 45 min mark to the point I was falling asleep...and they couldn't even get the satanic symbol right (upside down)...Oh yeah, if you are expecting an interesting twist in the end - bad luck for you. The ending is so incredibly silly I don't even want to talk about it.I'm sorry, but I did not like this film. Maybe I'm not a fan of silly comedies.",Ready or Not
99,Carycomic,A half-serious horror spoof recently imported from Canada.,5,28 August 2019,"I had a choice between two movies on this rainy afternoon. DORA THE EXPLORER...or READY OR NOT. D.T.E. started sooner, so I chose that one.Boy! Was that a mistake.After twenty-five minutes of listening to Dora breaking the Fourth Wall, like an adolescent poor's man version of Deadpool, I walked out of the theater and bought a ticket to R. O. N. A mixed blessing, to say the least. But, on the bright side I was able to sit through the entirety of it. And, even better, I was the only one in the audience during the matinee I chose! So, I was able to make slightly sarcastic comments, half out loud, without being shushed by other movie-goers.A good thing, too.The first half of this film is only mildly amusing...and definitely nowhere near as suspenseful as the second half. I mean, just the opening shot of all those board games (and one in particular) gives you a pretty good idea what the back story for this weirdo family is going to be!Then, there's all the swearing.Were the writers getting paid by the profanity? I haven't heard that many F-bombs dropped since the original CABIN FEVER! Which, if memory serves, I accused the cast thereof of trying to sound like vintage Robert Deniro...with none of his acting talent. Well, the same holds true for most of the cast of R.O.N. The only notable exceptions are Samara Weaving, who's totally new to me (and totally believable as the unexpectedly feisty Grace); and Andie McDowell, the only recognizably big name in the cast.In summary, then, I give this five stars (four stars better than JENNIFER'S BODY). As in; not bad! But, I've definitely seen comparatively scarier.",Ready or Not

The cast is strong and the storyline is well constructed. The standard horror cliches sink it down slightly from time to time, but these are only a slight blip. 2019 had a strong line-up of horror films and this is one of them. The casting of Weaver was the correct choice and similar to You're Next, it doesn't hurt to have the lead actress as a strong person compared to the, just a victim.",Ready or Not
101,JohnRayPeterson,"Deliciously amusing, I hope everyone involved in it makes lots of money, they deserve it.",8,8 December 2019,"I'm not usually interested in the comedy horror thriller, but when I caught the ratings on another site and read some of the reviews here, I decided to give it a go. I was absolutely delighted. Best if I control myself and spare you any sort of spoiler; also best if you avoid them too, as your viewing experience will be that more rewarding.The concept was original and every element worked well, from a cast of characters who all have an important part to play to how well they played their part. The script I would tend to believe was an easy sell to the producers. Samara Weaving who plays the main character, Grace, doesn't steal the show, she is the show. You will have your pick of delicious characters to root for, oh yes you will; and by 'root for' I mean wish you could beat the living daylight out of, but always in a fun way.The production and direction appear not to have missed any detail, important or small, which is why the story flows well. As for the visual, again, very pleasant and most importantly, effective. Lastly but not to be denied, the soundtrack and tune selection was right on the money; it enhanced it all superbly. If you understand what contrast in art, all forms of it, is about and how it works, then you'll get that the contrast the soundtrack delivered is what brings you to smile all along and without missing a beat to the very end.If this review didn't provide any clue of what the movie is about, except for the genre, but left you with a feeling that it is one you would want to see, then you can thank me later, after you've watched it.",Ready or Not

Each character have different ways: Fat guy not believe with family matter,,,,that's why he just play with his phone,,,,Becky is just do it for their family, Daniel just play like that because he feel this is matter thing.. Only Tony and Helene is very high desire want to kill the bride for family believe.. And don't expect this is like a serious pro killer movie likes Friday the 13th, Halloween etc.. It's just a normal family to kill someone.. That's why they seem not pro to kill someone. But this movie has many surprise likes Daniel save the bride, and then Alex change at end and then?!!

105,msbreviews,Rating: B-,6,21 August 2019,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)Once again, I didn't know anything going into the theater regarding this movie. In fact, Ready or Not wasn't even on my watchlist until the beginning of this week. I thought it was just going to be a passable and cheap horror flick, but the tremendously positive feedback from everyone around the world convinced me to give it a go. Fortunately, I wasn't disappointed! Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett deliver a dumb yet entertaining film with a childish yet fun concept never really explored in the gruesome and bloody way they do.It's one of those movies which the only flaw they might have has to do with the viewer's expectations. You'll only dislike this story if you don't accept its lighthearted tone. If you go in expecting a film filled with truly terrifying and scary sequences, you won't get that. If you go in expecting a movie with a dark vibe and tonally heavy scenes, you won't get that. It's one of the most common issues that audiences have all over the world: unrealistic expectations. After watching the trailers, it's clear that Ready or Not was always marketed as a horror-comedy with more emphasis on the dumb fun that the concept inevitably provides, so don't expect something the producers didn't even think of doing.Having that in mind, the film definitely delivers what it promises. It's a fast-paced hide-and-seek game, filled with suspenseful scenes and genuinely funny moments. Its short runtime doesn't really let us care about every character, but to be fair, it's not like it truly matters in this case. Samara Weaving plays the bride who has to hide while the rest of the family tries to find her. Overall, everyone gives good performances, but Weaving completely steals the show with fantastic reactions to different situations, always making space for an extra laugh.Despite the unique exploration of a strange premise, it has a pretty generic and even formulaic development, which is a bit of a letdown. Granted, the ending is, well, unexpected in the way that it is executed, but its final result is still very predictable. There's a lot of cheesy moments, some do work, but others aren't near as effective. The score is actually one of the surprises since it's not usual for this feature to have such an impact in a rather simple movie. It provides a few chuckles with some witty lyrics, and it helps with elevating the suspense in the more tense sequences. It's also mostly well-shot and set in one-location, something I always deeply appreciate.All in all, Ready or Not accomplishes exactly what it set out to do. It delivers a fun and entertaining 90-minute hide-and-seek game like we've never seen before. Its R rating lets its makers do whatever they please with the amount of blood and goriness present in a scene, which ultimately culminates in a jaw-dropping, hilarious ending. Samara Weaving is brilliant as the main character, carrying the whole film on her shoulders. Is it cliche? Yes. Is it formulaic and predictable? Yes. Is it cheesy? Hell, yes. However, this movie never intended to be a groundbreaking achievement in the genre. It just wants to deliver good fun. And it does.",Ready or Not

113,CANpatbuck3664,Darkly Comedic with Some Great Work From Weaving in the Lead,8,7 October 2019,"I didn't know what to expect from Ready or Not but while I ended up being very impressed by the end, I wasn't on board at the start. The movie has a serious open with another new addition to the family ""playing the game"" and while the movie gets a little lighter when they shift to present day, it still lacked fun elements. They don't establish as many rules or alternatives for the premise as they should (probably my biggest gripe) and the idea of the hunt for Grace seems half-baked. But with an unexpected death, the movie makes a decision and goes a different route. This was what pulled me back in, the shift to make it a comedy was the correct one. There are very dark moments in this movie (I liked how they set up the mythology of the Le Domas family) but you are never far away from something that will make you laugh. If you aren't easily shocked or you love horror movies, there's some really funny stuff in here and it's the reason to go see this movie.Samara Weaving is on the rise, she was the only good aspect of The Babysitter (which was an attempt at a horror/comedy that missed the mark completely) and she had a brief appearance in Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri. She's a great heroine here, she can elicit sympathy in the dramatic moments but she was also really funny in those darkly comedic bits. She's a great asset to this movie and she shines. I think this will be a stepping stone to bigger things for her and with how excellent she was in this movie, if they decide to shoot a sequel, they should definitely bring her back.With Samara Weaving giving such a strong performance as the lead, the supporting cast is left to fill in the blanks. The family makes for a decent group of antagonists, the biggest name in the supporting cast is either Adam Brody or Andie McDowell. Brody is a better actor than he's given credit for, his character is complicated and I think Brody does a solid job of selling that. Andie is fine, she's a little wooden but she does a better job than I expected her to. My favourite was Melanie Scrofano (who I know as Bonnie McMurray in the hilarious show Letterkenny) as family screwup Emilie, she's over-the-top but she got some good laughs from me. Ditto for Kristian Braun for play Fitch. Mark O'Brien, Elyse Levesque and Henry Czerny round out the rest of the main players and they all do a solid job.Ready or Not goes through plenty of twists and turns to get to the end, some work better than others but I didn't have any problem going along with it. The ending pulls a nice bait and switch and then the creative team pushes all of their chips into pot. The final 5 minutes features some big finishes that aren't revolutionary but they had me giggling with what they chose to do. It was an interesting call but minus it taking the edge off the previous couple of scenes, it largely works.Ready or Not represented a different type of experience for me. When I go see a movie, I usually have watched the trailer, read or listened to a couple of reviews and investigated what I'm committing a couple of hours to (give or take a couple of minutes). I had heard the basic premise (which I didn't think was spectacular) but when I went to see this with a friend, we went in cold. I had seen it was well reviewed but having that fresh perspective really helped me enjoy it. Ready or Not was such a pleasant surprise and if your sense of humour skews towards a darker sensibility, I think it will be your cup of tea too. Its really funny, Samara Weaving is a great heroine, she's funny yet I was invested in her making it to the end. The supporting cast hits the right notes in helping the movie remain entertaining and I liked that they went all out with the ending. They don't pull punches and while it was surprisingly wacky, I liked the direction they went. Ready or Not doesn't hit the high that comparable horror/comedy Happy Death Day but this is a good alternative that is worth a watch. If I wasn't so late getting the review up, I'd definitely recommend seeing it in theatres but considering the time that lapsed, check this out on your preferred streaming service when it becomes available.",Ready or Not
114,Beejerman,CHEER! - (9 stars out of 10),9,5 December 2019,"The stage curtains open ...Well, that was different. ""Ready Or Not"" already gets high marks for originality. It is more than just a movie about survival, love, betrayal, family, tradition, or marriage. Actually, yeah it is - all of the above. It is surprisingly deep with characterization and plot. It is a gory, good time.It is Grace's wedding day. She found a good catch with Alex, who belongs to an extremely wealthy family - a family that abounds with eccentricities. Everyone is thrilled to have her joining them and the wedding is beautiful. There is just one small detail that her new husband failed to tell her. At the stroke of midnight, on their wedding night, she needs to play a game. It is, after all, family tradition! She agrees and she draws the game of Hide & Seek. Before she knows it, she is running for her life from the very family that welcomed her in with open arms.This movie grabs you pretty much from the get-go and doesn't let go. It is paced very well, moving along at a good clip, effectively holding your attention until the explosive ending (and I use that term liberally). The acting is right on the money, the special effects and cinematography well executed, and there are plenty of twists and turns to keep you wondering what in the world is going on and why.I highly recommend ""Ready Or Not"". It delivers on all counts, albeit with some over-the-top moments, but still fitting to the story.

122,PyroSikTh,"Good Horror, Lacklustre Comedy",6,4 September 2020,"Grace is about to get married to Alex, the son of a wealthy family who got rich on boardgames, but there's a family secret he has yet to tell her; on wedding nights the family get together to play a randomly-selected game by a mystical box. If the box gives you Hide and Seek, it's a call for the family to sacrifice their new member in order to appease Mr. LeBail, the man their great-grandfather sold their souls to in order to establish a successful company. What follows is Grace coming to realise she's been chosen as the latest sacrifice, and her attempts to escape capture and murder by her new family, her own groom included.Firs thing's first, I was a little disappointed at the level of comedy in this movie. I'm no stranger to horror comedies, but Ready or Not was a far cry from the best of them, for one simple fact; it's not all that funny. It has its moments for sure, such as the coked-up sister-in-law who keeps accidentally killing the help, and the bloodbath of a climax, but many of its other lighter moments just didn't tickle me all that much - a smile at most. The main reason for this is the film's pacing when it comes to tone. There isn't really a single comedy moment for almost an hour in, so the sudden silliness feels misplaced and tonally wrong. Once we get more, they're so far spaced out that they feel more like an intrusion than a welcome and natural shift in tone.The horror elements of the movie work really well, although maybe too well to contrast with the comedy. Other than a couple of scenes, the wealthy family are played fairly straight, like they weren't aware they were meant to be funny. While humour can certainly be found in their desperate outbursts, they were too serious for laughs. I wouldn't say you felt sorry for the family, but there were definitely moments where you could taste their fear just as much as Grace's, and it just felt wrong to laugh at people who are afraid of their impending doom. Another example of this is when Grace is cornered and lets out this scream that sounds more like an animal wailing. I did laugh at this, but out of pure embarrassment for how awkward that scream was. It didn't come across as intentional at all, and so her fear in that moment sucked any humour from the sound at all. It was just cringy and bad.The general plot of the movie, particularly from a horror standpoint, was actually surprisingly good. I spent the first half of the movie or so waxing out loud about how ridiculous this was as a premise, but by the end I found everything was explained and reasoned out fairly well. Grace's reactions and fighting back were fantastic as well, including her suiting up with a shotgun that doesn't work because it's a prop. Of course the family wouldn't leave a functioning shotgun lying around. In fact she made a pretty convincing final girl through and through, never resorting to out-of-the-blue superheroics, but not being a completely helpless bimbo either. She comes across as just a normal human being who finds themself in extraordinary circumstances.Acting was fairly good all round. Samara Weaving was great as Grace, adding her own little charms to the character. She felt super real around strange family, with her awkward smiles and laughter as she participates in what she thinks is a bizarre but perfectly harmless family tradition. Adam Brody was also great as her brother-in-law who straddles the fence on his commitment to the tradition and flip-flops throughout the movie as to whether he wants to participate or help. For a character so morally ambiguous, Brody does an alarmingly good job at making him likeable. Henry Czenry and Andie MacDowell were also enjoyable to watch as the patriarch and matriarch of the family dominion, although it was a little disappointing that Orphan Black alums Kristian Bruun and Elyse Levesque didn't get too much to play with beyond ""materialistic spouse""In all Ready or Not was a far better horror than it was comedy. I almost feel like it would've been a better movie without the more obviously lighthearted moments, and instead found a little more humour in serious situations. Even then though, it's not a particularly groundbreaking movie and it's the kind of thing I'll likely forget about in a week's time. I give Ready or Not an okay 6/10.",Ready or Not
123,sweidman-28016,Fun Horror Comedy,8,3 September 2019,"Ready or Not Review:Ready or Not is a horror comedy staring Sumara Weaving as a bride whose wedding night takes a sinister turn when her eccentric new in-laws force her to take part in a terrifying game. While playing a simple game of hide-and-seek she discovers that they're trying to kill her for a ritual. I love a good horror comedy when done well. Horror is probably my favorite genre, since there's so much you can do with it, and comedy is my least favorite genre. When the two mix to produce a quirky thriller, I typically like that. I didn't know what to think of Ready or Not before the film. During it, thought, I found myself laughing and having a great time. Sumara Weaving is just fantastic in this. Her fear and anger was believable and not forced at all. This being her first bigger theatrical role, I think she was great and the best performance. She undergoes so many horrific events. After each event her beautiful dress is ruined little by little. I really liked how they transformed it. The other performance I was invested with was Adam Brody as her new brother in law. He's a flawed character conflicted with the events so I wasn't sure which route he would take. There's some twists within the plot. Once I thought she'd be safe, something happened and it continued on. Some stuff was kind of predictable to me. It was trying to get a lot done in a 100 minute runtime. I personally think they could've either stretched it out a little or cut it down about 10 minutes. Towards the end I just couldn't tell if they should've added that much or should've cut it down a little. The plot other than that was fine. Well developed characters that needed to be developed, though at first I couldn't tell which family members were which (ex: mother-in-law, cousins, that sort of thing). I liked how we could explore the different parts of the house. The production design was beautiful with the big mansion. The tense scenes in the limited space made for a fun time. The gore was really good and not too much CGI. In general good makeup and hairstyling. Overall this is just a fun horror comedy. I'd be surprised if you didn't laugh. It's dark humor so if you're not into that I don't think this is the movie for you. It's also very violent so if you have a problem with violence this also isn't the movie for you. I'd recommend Ready or Not. Its something new and just a fun watch. I won't say too much more because it's fun to explore for yourself.My Grade: A-",Ready or Not

Andie MacDowell was also good, but the rest of the cast was pretty bad, especially the actor that played the dad. I liked what happened to the ""help"" gag, and I really, really enjoyed the end!

Well, it really was quite an enjoyable romp, but I beg to differ and oppose to those who praise ""Ready or Not"" for originality and are calling it refreshing or unique.""Ready or Not"" is without a doubt a solid one to add to the not-so-many great horror comedies of this century, but it's also far from flawless. An unsuspecting woman is getting married at her new husbands massively rich familys house, a bunch of dysfunctional and secretive family members get introduced, a silly and mysterious tradition turns into a violent, devious and satanic rollercoaster. The pacing's even, we get carried on smoothly by solid acting, quality cinematography, gruesome kills, dry humour and somewhat familiar characters. Personally, it was the violence, action, the overall aesthetic and some of the performances that did it for me. I laughed maybe once, the jokes are pretty dry and mostly far from original, but I do not think of it as much of a fault here. The twist/s (if you can call them that) are predictable, in fact, the whole movie is quite easy to predict. Most of the themes presented have been seen before, recent indies like ""Satanic Panic"" and ""Monster Party"" come to mind, of course, these specific ones are a lot cheaper and also worse examples of the same themes. The dysfunctional family farce and all the shticks that come with it have been enjoyed tens of times before, sadly, ""Ready or Not"" doesn't reinvent the ways of that.Don't get me wrong, it's a highly entertaining and satisfying romp of graphic horror, okay comedy and high budget sound & looks, it's just that it's not much of a memorable movie, and I couldn't call it unique under any duress. My rating: 7/10.",Ready or Not

Clearly not everyone is, as the dark comedy 'Ready or Not' is equally parts excruciating as it is laughable.At times, 'Ready' feels like it can't figure out what its identity should be. There are enough gruesome, gory sequences that make you think you're watching one of those throwaway, 2000s horror movies, but then you listen to some of the dialogue and ridiculous one-liners and you think, ""what wormhole did I just jump through to get here?"" Samara Weaving is not a bad actress, but in this role she is mostly reduced to a shrieking, helpless newlywed who is supposed to pull herself up by her bootstraps and transform into a rebel with a cause who will stop at nothing to protect herself. Okay.There are some cheap thrills thrown in here, but for the most part, 'Ready' is a lame letdown. There are next to no redeeming qualities, not the least of which is a predictable ending - boooooooring.If you're thinking of giving 'Ready or Not' a try because you're in the mood for a creative horror/action film, better look harder.",Ready or Not

Little does Grace know that what this game entails is a bloody fight for survival. Just when you think it's going down a predictable route, there's a sudden occurrence that jolts you and throws you back into the action. I was expecting it to be fun, which it really is, but was also surprised that I found it a really cathartic experience as good horror flicks have the strange power of doing, and came out of the cinema feeling great! I laughed often and winced at the violence in equal measure. I think it does a pretty good job as a horror-comedy and everyone looks like they're having a great time with the gallows humour. What really makes the film is Samara Weaving; her performance is nothing short of iconic and if there's any justice in the future, it'll be looked on as just that.

133,DeBBss,Fun to Watch,6,1 June 2020,"Ready or Not is a comedy-horror that doesn't attempt to offer anything new to the genre. All it was made for was to entertain, and Ready or Not is a very entertaining movie. It knows what it is and it plays off of that in a funny way. I was actually surprised that Ready or Not wasn't completely bad; I was expecting it to be a cheesy horror, but I had a lot of fun watching it.It's about a newlywed bride who tries to survive a family's tradition of playing a game after an in-law's marriage. Grace, the bride, has to make it through the night before she dies to win the game. The plot is a little goofy and unrealistic, but it's a fun concept and it totally works. The pacing is great and it really creates some intense scenes. There is one issue that I do have with the screenplay, and that's the amount of exposition dumping at the beginning. We get to learn everything about the history of the family and the tradition, which I think it ruins the mystery of the story. There should have been little amounts of exposition given throughout the movie, so that Grace can figure out exactly what's happening.The characters were actually good, which was very surprising to me, as many horrors struggle at writing good characters. Every character has their own personality and they all offer different things to the table. Some characters were the antagonists but they were actually likable, like Aunt Helene. There were times where you would actually cheer on Aunt Helene, which is weird because she's the most unempathetic antagonist in the whole movie. Overall, the characters were well written and even likable at times.Ready or Not was a huge surprise, and I'm glad I watched it. It plays on all the cliches and exaggerates it. The plot and characters were well written and unique. Ready or Not is definitely a movie that I would recommend.",Ready or Not

director: Tyler Gillet and Matt bettelini olpin
Starring: Samara Weaving,Adam Brody,Mark O brien,Henry Czerny,Andie Macdowell etcoverall rating 56/100
Ready or not is based on a loving couple called Grace ( Samara Weaving) and Alex ( Mark o brien) but in order to be accepted into into the family Grace must play a game with them with drastic and disturbing consequences for everyone. Ready or not had such a big potential to be good but largely fell flat for me the film was just mediocre. Lets talk about why.Lets start with a positive however. The plot was fairly unique and something i hadn't seen before. The whole plot was interesting to me. Having a family so adamant that they have to kill anyone who comes into the family was an interesting concept. And it made the film enjoyable for doing something different despite the poor execution.Next i thought the use of gore was fantastic. The gore really left an impact with each scene that it was in. It also really kept you on the edge of your seat as there was some admittedly uncomfortable scenes involving crushing of bones. But that just shows the director is achieving there desired reaction. And i thought the gore looked surprisingly realistic despite its very small budget.Next however i would like to say that the film was painfully predictable. Pretty much every character had the generic role within the film and hardly any of them stood out in a interesting way at all. You
could tell what was going to happen at the end because they told you what would happen so therefore most of the film was pretty pointless. It was a shame as the plot was different its just the ingredients within the plot everyone had seen before.Next despite in my opinion the film being tonally unsure about what genre it is the film was actually pretty funny. Despite some of the characters such as the loopy one who accidentally kills everyone was admittedly funny despite it maybe not supposed to be funny. It was a strange one as i felt that the film was more of a comedy but i don't know or think this was the movies goal. And it had moments with the acting and the script where it was so bad it was good/funny.Adding onto the previous point the script for this film was absolutely terrible. Some of the things that most of the characters was ridiculous and cringey. It made a large majority of the characters seem incredibly dumb. The script was fairy strong for the lead actress but it just felt like they didn't bother with any of the other characters.Next i thought the acting from the lead actors Mark o brian and Samara weaving was pretty good. Both of there performances held the film together in my opinion. Mark o brien put on a very believable performance of the struggle between loyalty to his family and the love for his wife and he did solid acting here. But the real star of this film was Samara weaving. She was fantastic in Ready or not and should be a big star in the future. She did an excellent performance in portraying the slow mental breakdown of her character after slowly realising what family she married into. The script for her was fantastic and relatable and really made you connect with her character. And both of these characters bough a relatable and good theme about wanting to impress other members of the family and Ready or not tackled this very well. And the only other good performance and character was Adam Brody. He bought the most comedy and was the only family member that wasn't the two leads that did a good performance. You could tell throughout the film how conflicted he was in terms of were his loyalties lie and his death was admittedly sad.And my final positive before i get into the main points that bought the film down. The film did manage to execute a very tense tone well. The film despite lacking in jumpscares did have many tense scenes that were mostly achieved and elevated by Samara Weavings performance. The fact that you genuinely didn't know when a member of the family was going to find the lead protagonist was an interesting way at keeping the tense tone consistent we will get onto the overall tone soon.Now for my final three negatives that really bought the film down for me. First of all the film was completely tonally inconsistent. This movie did not know what genre it wanted to be at all. It was supposed to be a horror and a comedy but there was not enough of either in order to justify what the movie was trying to do. It wasn't that funny and it certainly wasn't scary and the film had some moments where it was supposed to be funny but it was just pure toe curling cringe. And the whole film just felt so amateurish. You could just tell the director was new to the game and didn't really know what they were doing.And finally there was many lapses in logic and the ending was just terrible. There was many scenes especially towards the end that were either ridiculous or did not make sense in the slightest. The lead character jumped a really high distance and was absolutely fine and considering the amount of injuries she sustained throughout the whole film i was surprised but glad she was alive. And the whole point of Adam brodys character poisining his family members was for Samara weaving character to escape but it literally did nothing to them despite him saying it will make them very drowsy. And finally the ending was terrible when Grace survived until dawn and nothing happened to the family it firstly made the characters and the film look stupid but there was just a massive awkward silence. And when they did explode like they said they would it just was ridiculous and made the whole film pointless.Overall Ready or not is held together by the fantastic performance by Samara weaving and had potential to be great. But fell flat due to poor directing,acting,execution of the plot and its tonal inconsistencies.",Ready or Not

Well done, well cast and entertaining story even if some of it was somewhat predictable. Instead of just having the typical bash the rich they spun that to bash the rich but also all the greedy spouses that married into the family were forced to fight for their lives too. Just because they didn't get Hide & Seek when they had to play on their marriage night they were forced to play with the same consequence which was pretty ingenious and I thought the end was great. There were a lot of comical parts to the movie, many of the deaths were funny as was the YouTube video on how to us a weapon and it was also quite gory in parts. Overall I found it an entertaining 90 minutes and one of the better movies of this genre I've seen in years. I enjoyed it much more than Get Out and Halloween last year.

141,mike-c-b,Could have been a classic,5,28 March 2020,"Samara Weaving is fantastic especially at the beginning. She plays a happy, fun bride in mood for some hide & seek. The other actors however generally miss the mark, to the point where you just skip through the movie with the sound off.The other actors come across generally spineless and careful... the opposite of who their characters are. There should be more hidden low tones in their voice, and be spending effort ""trying to be nice"". Throughout the film 90% of the time they're ""trying to be dramatic"".Dramatic music is often played over the top of an already dramatic scene, or even an ""ASMR"" (environmental sound) scene which carries plenty of drama already. Putting cliche war-drum music over the top is a finger sign to the viewer.Samara Weaving's ""most disturbing"" scream sound effect is also played in place of nearly every scream she does towards the end, and it takes you further out of the film.Could have been improved 50% at least with a better edit.",Ready or Not
142,WalkdenEntertainment,It's a Killer Game or Hide & Seek...,6,31 October 2019,"Our film introduces us to Grace (Samara Weaving), a gorgeous bride who is having her wedding day and marrying the groom of her dreams. Grace was orphan growing up and she's always desired having family around her. As the groom's parents and other family members attend the wedding they seem happy and supportive of Grace and the marriage. Grace is welcomed into the family... however.It is a tradition in this family that after a wedding, a game is played in a big mansion and all family members must participate. Grace is now part of a game of Hide & Seek in which her new, loving in-laws are trying to hunt her down and kill her unless she can stay alive until the crack of dawn.I personally enjoyed the performance of Samera Weaving as the lead actress. I found her work here very convincing as she embraces her character.The film's general style and set design, particularly of the mansion (which is the film's main setting), looks amazing and has lots of detail for audiences to appreciate.I also loved the idea of this film, but it did remind me a lot of another film entitled ""You're Next"" (2011). This was a film which also involved family members trying to kill someone. Based on the film's marketing (trailer, poster), I also had the impression that our leading lady would be fighting the family members one by one, serving them bloody revenge through the night... but that isn't really the case. But don't worry, there's still plenty of blood and gore for horror nutbags to enjoy.My two biggest issues with the film is some of the characters and elements in the film's plot. Many of the characters are... slightly silly. To top it off, many side characters will change motives rather quickly and at times they will seem in a rush to kill Grace and then at other times seem not to care at all. The film's plot and concept is fun but don't expect any back story or deep details into the elements and workings of the story. The film's final moments are slightly rushed and there are unexpected twists in the plot (but some would say this is a good thing). The pacing during the finale for me just didn't match the pacing of the story that was being told or the tension that was being built up.Overall, Ready or Not brings many elements to the screen that can be enjoyed, such as Shock factor, Gore and comedy. Impressive work from actress Samara Weaving as the leading lady and her solid performance are a big positive for the film. The film's side characters however come across somewhat silly and make unwise choices. Nevertheless, this film has got some creativity and freshness about it even if it's not a perfect or if it's similar to a previous horror flick we've seen before.6.2/10

Alex comes from a rich family who have their own traditions and habits. Grace her future in-laws let Grace choose a card to play a ""game"" with her.
Grace opts for the hide-and-seek card and is then told that she must hide in the house of her in-laws and must stay hidden until it is morning again. Grace her in-laws have until the morning to find her and then kill her.This film starts as a nice idea about a kind of hide and seek for an adult with a dark twist. The film largely has a good balance between horror and comedy, so the mood of the film often changes from exciting to comical moments. Unfortunately the film loses this balance in the end, because there the film is more comical and no longer scary or exciting. This is mainly because at the end the story and the characters seem a bit too busy and exaggerated. This way the film looks a bit more like you're watching a movie from the Scary Movie series.For people who are familiar with horror or comedy films, some moments in the film may come across as somewhat predictable, making them no longer exciting or funny. If you keep thinking too much about certain events or choices that the characters make, the film can sometimes seem a bit stupid and unrealistic. Thus it can be seen again that the writers of the film script are still beginning and more unknown writers.Samara Weaving provides good and appropriate acting in the film. During the film, she shows the right emotions in the various surprising situations that her character experiences. Unfortunately at the end of the film, just like the others, she does this too exaggerated, which means she starts losing the credibility of her character. Adam Brody also does good acting as a family member who no longer takes family traditions seriously.

Ready or Not succeeds quite well tho, I was entertained. It's not that much of a horror, as it's not really scary, but rather depends on the gore. I bet real gore hounds would've liked even more, but a few scenes were a bit too much for me, not a huge gore fan here.My kind of ""horror"" comedy is the lighter kind, Joe Dante etc, not necessarily the Evil Dead etc kind that are more hard core.What I liked was the somewhat cliched crazy family mansion, candles, thunder, secret passages kind of old school ""gothic"" atmosphere, it made a lot for me. Acting was pretty good (although too much flat out screaming for me), the comedy was quite nicely timed and the characters were nicely balancing between crazy and goofy.Well made movie not to be taken too seriously!",Ready or Not

The film reminded me of Jordan Peele's ""Get Out"", because this film added psycho family, just like this one, and Ready or Not, is one of the worst deadliest game of Hide and Seek, that you never even heard, seen, or played before.

The main problem, in my opinion, is the main character, as she has an alarming lack of development in the script department and she's neither cool nor badass enough for the underdevelopment not to be an issue. She's just there, annoying and oblivious to almost everything, playing this game and you're supposed to root for her. The family is a bit better treated by the screenplay, as most of them are well established if a bit cliched, and you can understand more or less their motivations while being actually funny. Another minor thing I didn't like was the inconsistency of the game, as at first it was just a normal hide and seek game but later on there is this ritual you're supposed to do, which makes absolutely no sense at all, I really hated that. Other than that it is fun and entertaining with a very memorable ending that redeems most of the faults throughout.",Ready or Not

I liked Andie MacDowell in here but she does do the same fake southern accent in every role she takes, no idea why? Anyway, our heroine is quite likable. The rest of the family is convinced if they do not follow the game's rules they will end up with an unfavorable fate. Now this whole allegory wraps up nicely in the end.

This is horror, comedy and great acting in a movie which surprises and have one of the greatest ending of any movie I have seen in a long time.I do think that the movie feels too short, it should have been dragged out a little bit more - especially for us to get to know everyone a bit more so we feel more when they go poff or get their heads chopped off or shot or strangled or...
I also think a few things do not make total sense, however it is a horror drama comedy so I suppose that is not completely needed.

160,quaseprovisorio,it's better the average because it oesn't avoid social commentary,7,1 April 2020,"This movie is not very different from some leisure activities of french or the portuguese royalty. They would release a pig in the woods, or another animal to eat and the first person getting it or killing it would be the winner. With another context this isn't very different: a bunch of powerful peope against someone from a foster family. The Man vs you.It is put in a very simple way yes - but the truth is: if this wasn't the main theme of the film, the killing order would be very different. Notice how the first ones to die are the maids and the driver? They are the weaker ones. The powerful die at the end. I would love to see the theme getting more developed, because it would be funnier to see the bride killing them, but they are humans too and the movie expresses that well.Besides that, the film has funny moments and some gory moments too, that are an appeal to the audience. But what makes this movie having dark humor is how unworried about the life of the ""peasants"" the rich family is. It's their indifference that makes the funny part of this movie, how normal they treat their employees getting killed. It's like they don't even realize they are human beings like them. Maybe they don't give them the same value they attribute to themselves.That's why this movie is a seven for me and not a six or even a five. Without the social commentary is not as good as other scary movies. But because that layer is important here, i think it elevates to most of scary movies out there.",Ready or Not

I thought it was going to be a darker comedy, was more slapstick. We find ourselves at a rich folks wedding, and as the actual wedding dies down the real event takes place. The new bride plays a game with her new family, because that's where the family got their cash, games. Most of the games are harmless, except one: Ready or Not. Nope, its Hide and Seek. Guess what card the bride, Grace, draws? Ready or Not? Nope, it's Hide and Seek. Grace's new husband, Alex, lets her in on the details, Grace doesn't quite get it, until the arrows start flying. So, they hunt her down, not to kill her, but wound her, because they need her for a ritual to perform at dawn, that said, ya know she's gonna make it until dawn. What happens at the ritual? Her sacrifice to Satan of course. What happens if the family doesn't succeed in the kill? They are not really sure, they think they'll die, but who knows, they're just following tradition. Like I said I expected a darker vibe than it has, but a fun watch nonetheless. Filmbufftim on FB.",Ready or Not
162,Bertaut,An entertaining horror-comedy that takes aim at the decadence and insularity of the 1%,7,14 October 2019,"Written by Guy Busick and R. Christopher Murphy, and directed by Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett, Ready or Not is a horror-comedy and social satire that comically exaggerates the anxieties attendant with marrying into a wealthy family and mocks the insular nature of such families, so obsessed with their wealth that they've become disconnected from the real world. In the tradition of Richard Connell's 1924 short story, ""The Most Dangerous Game"", the film is about elites hunting common folk, but it tells its story with tongue firmly in cheek. And whilst it can be a tad episodic at times, and the manner in which it presents some of its violence is somewhat problematic, this is a very enjoyable and funny film that's well worth checking out.It is the wedding day of Grace (an exceptional Samara Weaving) and Alex Le Domas (Mark O'Brien), whose family earned their fortune making board games, and are now decadently wealthy. Several years previously, Alex turned his back on the family, and it's only since he met Grace (a foster child eager to have a family to call her own) that he has started to rebuild bridges. His mother Becky (Andie MacDowell) and father Tony (a barely sane Henry Czerny) are thrilled to have him back, and credit Grace with his return. His aunt Helene (a hilariously acerbic Nicky Guadagni), however, makes no bones about the fact that she hates Grace. Elsewhere there's Alex's brother Daniel (Adam Brody), an alcoholic locked in a loveless marriage to Charity (Elyse Levesque), and their cocaine-addicted sister Emilie (a wonderfully hapless Melanie Scrofano) and her husband Fitch (a scene-stealing Kristian Bruun). Shortly after the ceremony, Alex explains a strange family tradition to Grace - whenever someone new marries into the clan, they must participate in a game, chosen at random by a mechanised box using a deck of cards (Charity gor checkers). At an austere ceremony, Grace is asked to operate the box and she receives the hide and seek card, with Tony explaining that the only way for her to win is to stay hidden until dawn. And so, Grace hides in the mansion, unaware that the family (sans Alex) are arming themselves with crossbows, axes, hunting rifles, and assorted antique weaponry.The film's various psychoanalytical/satirical subtexts are fairly obvious - a lampooning of blue blood families clueless as to how the real world works, a savage deconstruction of the institution of marriage, and a gynocentric celebration of a woman fighting back against old-world patriarchy. In relation to these last two themes, nowhere are they more apparent than in Grace's wedding dress, that most classic symbol of marriage, which becomes dirtier and more damaged as the film progresses, with costume designer Avery Plewes using the dress to show the stages of Grace's symbolic deconstruction of the institution of marriage (to survive the night, she must make the dress more conducive to running and hiding, which involves a lot of ripping and tearing).Concerning the film's engagement with wealth, essentially it suggests that, yes, as we all know, the rich are very different from you and I, but could it be that not only are they different, maybe they're actually evil? Of course, it's not suggesting this with anything even approaching realism, and much of the film's humour comes from the Le Domas family itself; they're wealthy, evil, violent, and powerful, but so too are they hilariously incompetent. For example, it's been so long since anyone has got the hide and seek card that everyone is a little fuzzy on the rules, and they spend a good chunk of the film arguing with one another about the hunt - Fitch and Charity want to use modern weapons, but Tony maintains they have to use antique weaponry, nor are they allowed to use the castle's security cameras to track Grace.This all goes back to a century-old deal made between the family's original patriarch Victor and a mysterious traveller named Mr Le Bail, who promised Victor that the family would become hugely wealthy, but only if they maintained the tradition of having new family members play a game on their wedding night, laying out the rules for what was to happen if they got the hide and seek card. Tony argues that the rules can be no different from those originally established by Le Bail, but, really, his argument never amounts to much more than ""tradition...reasons"". The film gets a lot of laughs out of showing characters trying to get to grips with their weapon - from Fitch taking time out from the hunt to look up ""how to use a crossbow"" videos on YouTube to Emilie accidentally dispatching several maids due to her inability to handle her weapon.Another theme, although one not developed to the extent of the above, is religion. Le Bail, for example, is believed by the family to be a demonic figure, and his name, obviously enough, is an anagram of Belial, the demon from the Tanakh who would later form the basis for the Christian and Jewish depictions of Satan. On the other hand, Grace's name most likely references the idea of Divine grace. Elsewhere, the film depicts a pit of slaughtered goats, alluding to ritual animal sacrifice, a pre-Christian practice. Goats are also important in Christianity, especially in the practice of scapegoating, whereby a goat takes upon it the sins of the community and is cast into the desert, symbolically removing the taint of those sins (as per Leviticus 16:8-10). Along the same lines, Grace injures her hand on a nail, in a veiled reference to the Stigmata. However, whether or not we're supposed to interpret her as a Christ figure is hard to say as, although these references are interesting in isolation, they never really coalesce into anything concrete.Looking at some other problems, the film is, generally speaking, very slight; it's short and it's silly, and it's not going to change your life or lead you down the road of esoteric revolution. The violence is also (somewhat) problematic. The film maintains the stance that the rich are insane and the violence they mete out is contemptible. However, some of the biggest laughs are reserved for Emilie's accidental killing of the maids. And I have to admit, I found the way she haplessly dispatches two of them exceptionally funny. Also funny is that after one of the kills, the family are trying to have a conversation, which is continually interrupted by the gurgling of a mortally wounded maid; until Helene takes an axe to her head. And again, I have to admit, I laughed a lot at that scene, even though I recognised that the film was essentially asking the audience to see this violence as funny but some of the violence elsewhere as not so much. In this sense, it kind of wants to have its cake and eat it, picking and choosing when the audience should laugh; it takes Grace's stakes seriously but also encourages us to laugh at some (and only some) of the violence elsewhere, which is problematically inconsistent.Nevertheless, as I said, these scenes did make me laugh, so make of that what you will. Although Ready or Not is slight, its satirical ire is focused, even if the tendency towards irreverence doesn't always chime with the tone of the socio-political agenda. Allegorically skewering inherited wealth, marriage, tradition, even religion, the film suggest that with their atavistic rules and sense of entitlement, the Le Domas family embody the concept that old-money can lead to insularity from modernity. Offering us a match, the film suggests that perhaps the only way to deal with such irrelevancies and their sense of self-importance is to burn them to the ground. And it has a blast showing us why.",Ready or Not

It gave me a bit of You're Next vibes but also loved how original the story was. I also wasnt really expecting that ending, but I loved it and thought it was so over-the-top and perfect for this story. Also, I really liked Adam Brody in this, I did feel more for his character more than the main character played by Samara Weaving (and maybe thats a slight problem) but its still an overall plus in my book. But speaking of the main character or final girl as you will, as she wasnt as badass/capable as I was hoping her to be. Its not like shes dumb necessarily, but I feel like she only survives for so long because the family has stormtrooper aim. There was a couple of moments here and there where the comedy was a bit much but overall I did really enjoy this film.",Ready or Not

167,TuesdayThe17th,"From the universe of ""V/H/S"" and ""Southbound""",10,6 December 2019,"""Ready Or Not"" is easily 2019s very best horror film from some of the truest auteurs in the genre. There is literally too much positive to say about this film that I can't even get into it depth because it is overwhelming. But bottom line...its amazing....truly amazing. It is directed by Tyler Gillett and Matt Bettinelli Olpen who make up 2/3 of Radio Silence and is in the same vein of ""You're Next"" but honestly better. I already knew what to expect as I love Radio Silence as no other crew of filmmakers have inspired me more. They work falls into a category I call the ""V/H/Sverse"" which is a universe of horror films all its own which includes titles like ""V/H/S"" 1 and 2, ""You're Next"", ""Southbound"", ""Siren"", ""The Ritual"", etc. When ""V/H/S"" came out in 2012 I was beyond floored by it. Now, even though Amateur Night is the segment that made headlines, 10/31/98 was just as good of a segment. I have never seen anything so creepy and truly scary in my life. I love the rawness. And most of all, I LOVED what they did with the chair that followed the teenagers through the house. This is my style of filmmaking and their work just hits me the right way. They did it again with ""Southbound"". Again, taking second to Bruckner's segment with what is perhaps the best segment in the film. I was worried these guys were fading away or going to break up similarly to the vicious brothers, but ""Ready Or Not"" boasts a loud and fun future for them in the genre. The films bonus features formally introduces them as a whole and I'm like ""phew,.finally"" lol",Ready or Not
168,peeedeee-94281,Ready or not!....I didn't like it!,2,31 August 2019,"I was intrigued by this one because of all the positive reviews, even though the trailer didn't quite sell it for me. It looked like a cross between The Purge and Eyes Wide Shut.
Anyway, the movie starts of alright, the set up for what is about to come first with a flashback of the childhood of the boys, who then we see in present day is getting married to a blonde outsider played by Samara Weaving.
I actually liked her initially. She seemed like someone we could root for and hope would kick some serious butt. Ultimately, I found her unlikable, just like all the other characters in the film. What was it about her I didn't like? Well, she just doesn't sell the role very well. Is she bad ass or is she just lucky, everything seems to work out too conveniently for her, considering she has several people hunting for her. She doesn't appear to have any fighting skills. But the worst part: Her scream. Ugh, every time she did that yodeling scream, I couldn't stop thinking about Adam Sandler in the waterboy. Or tarzan lol. I've never heard an annoying scream like that before lol.
The story's pacing and tone is just all over the place. Much of the killing is accidental, nothing happens due to skill. There were too many predictable moments, like that 'goat pit' or whatever they called it that scene was too obvious where it was going. And clearly the family didn't care about piling bodies out in the open?!
And the swearing was terrible. I'm no prude, and I look a good f word in the right place, but this movie was mainly filled with unfunny moments where the characters keep saying wtf over and over. The dialogue really needed improving.
The ending was kind of funny, but ultimately, unsatisfying. It really didn't make any sense either.
Overall, this movie was just okay, I'd recommend watching it on Netflix. I watched for a discount price so I can't complain. I give it 2 marks for the reasonably good CGI gore in a few places, but that's about it.",Ready or Not
169,Jared_Andrews,It's All Fun and Games,7,25 August 2020,"What a fun movie this is. For a joyous hour and a half, you can step into a simpler world. There's a likable hero (Samara Weaving) facing off against an unlikable villain family of psychotic satanic kooks.Psychotic satanic kooks, you say? Right, so what happens is the hero marries into a rich family who has amassed its fortune in games (think Parker Brothers or Milton Bradley). When the family insists that the wedding night end with a game, the hero views it as a quirky but harmless escapade. Oh, how wrong she is. Because of her misfortune of randomly drawing the card to play Hide and Seek, the entire family now believes they must kill her before dawn or suffer the wrath of a gamesman spirit that is responsible for their family fortune, or something like that. The details of the plotdon't matter a great deal other than to understand that the family is trying to kill her, so she runs around in a wedding dress trying to survive.Tonally, the movie is much more funny and exciting than it is scary. Even if you frighten easily, you should be able to tolerate this one. Though, a fair warning is needed about the violence. There's a lot of that. Much of it is comic violence, but a queasy stomach might act up anyway. Again, I'm just giving a fair warning.In a world where everything is politicized, you might have seen some people doing so with this movie. To me, that's a bit of a reach. At most, I would admit there is some fairly obvious social commentary, as the rich family members ridicule and look down their noses at this woman who isn't wealthy and is marrying into their world. The groom's aunt takes particularly aim at the bride, attacking her with her eyes and then later on literally attacking her with an axe.The message is clear, but I didn't bother exploring it too deeply because the movie doesn't appear to be asking for that from viewers. What I would encourage viewers to do instead is to enjoy the marvelous work of Weaving as she fights for her life in the most charming way possible. She's an absolute star, and the movie does not succeed if she is not able to balance being equal parts tough, cunning, and amused by the absurdity of her situation.",Ready or Not

I'm not all that much of a fan of most horror comedy movies, but ""Ready or Not"" completely knocked me out. Not only is it loaded with blood and gore in abundance, but the story or script is very very good, as is the acting. The movie is about a couple getting married, the male being from a very rich family and the couple is going to the family's estate to meet his family for a celebration. At midnight the bride has to participate in a game, depending on a card the bride picks that signifies what game it will be. this is a ritual the family does anytime a new member is introduced to the family. The only problem, a very big problem, is the card the bride draws is the worst one possible. The bride thinks it is just a hide and seek game, but it turns out, the family now has to kill her before the Sunrise. Then the fun starts, and so do the laughs. I just loved this movie, not only is it fun to watch this bumbling family trying to find and kill her, the blood and gore effects are top notch.

I expected a little more story, action or comedic fun, but after viewing the movie, I can say that it is pretty more bloody and gory than expected. The R-rating fits for today, 15 years ago it would have been a nc-17-rating. But I also noticed that most of the hunting scenes were somehow generic. The pure hunt had no fresh ideas or turns in it. There are many similar hunting stories like this on on the market. Just think on 'Surviving the Game' or 'The Collector', but this one has an occult background, which makes it interesting. The setting in the house looks worthy, the light and camera professional. The climax has some very funny moments, we had a bizarre laugh at. All in all, it's a kinky ending. I would consider it as a recommendation for people who like dark humor and sarcasm.",Ready or Not
186,lotekguy-1,Grisly humor is the skeleton supporting this gaudy splatterfest,7,20 August 2019,"While panning 2018's abysmal stab at a horror thriller Truth or Dare, I warned that any box-office success might spawn other flicks based on games of childhood past. The bad news is that I was prophetic; the good news is that at least the first two have been much better. Tag was arguably an outlier, since it was a comedy based on a true story of a handful of dudes with arrested development (the trait, not the TV series) at the core of their lasting bond.Now comes a splatterfest with a fair dose of humor that comes closer to Jordan Peele's excellent Get Out in its setup, with a far messier execution. Samara Weaving, lovely niece of Hugo, that much-replicated villain fighting Neo in the Matrix franchise, is a poor lass we find on the day she's marrying into one of the country's richest families, and meeting all but her intended for the first time. Though she truly loves scion Alex (Mark O'Brien), something seems amiss from the get-go. He's stayed away from the clan for years, and all the kinfolk are either warning her not to go through with the ceremony, or otherwise boding something wicked this way to come. Their type and level of dysfunction transcends all the caution signs she's given, or anyone else's Thanksgiving gathering.The family lives by a set of traditional rules and rituals that get stranger as the story progresses throughout the massive mansion that is their ancestral home. What seems like a twisty horror tale grows more comedic as it hurtles to the end. And that's the best part of the production. Most of the cast ranges from over-the-top to campy in suitable discharging their duties. The more you're tuned in for the funny elements (including some of the background music), the more you'll enjoy the package.Despite these upgrades from the first one, here are my specific dreaded possibilities from 18 months ago, that I still hope won't be made: Hokey Pokey Horror - Put your left foot in... or LOSE IT!; maybe Red Rover, Red Rover - Send Satan right over! That sets the stage for the likes of Musical Electric Chairs and Wring Around the Rosie.",Ready or Not

188,plasticanimalz,Amazing,8,8 September 2019,"Trailer looked good and I was hoping for the best, as, most movies these days are not great, and I'm hoping to be entertained, at the very least. Fully delivered, and was clever, fun, and as stylish as trailer promised. Had a plot, an actual story, which is rare for a horror film, and good writing, acting, production value. I was into it from beginning to end. Kept good pacing, was not too long or too short, and everything was clear and well explained without overdoing it and feeding everything to the audience.Best horror film since Cabin in the Woods. Happy Death Day had a similar fun, but a bit more b-movie than this. A warm welcome since most horror films over the past 20 years have really sucked. They've been either the gore porn garbage of the 2000s, or found-footage with terrible quality and zero story, or shock-value indie directors with lack of actual substance, so, this was refreshing.It's made much more than it's budget, but I'm guessing it hasn't done better because there wasn't that much advertising for it, and given the news today, people are a bit turned off by the subject matter. It wasn't gratuitous, and relied much more on the story, which had a point and was not just random violence.Well worth it to see in the theatre, but renting it at home will probably be nearly as enjoyable.",Ready or Not

Remind you of any other powerful American family?The Trumpian sense of uselessness among the trappings of weirdly Edwardian opulence gave this film a brilliant comic edge. Each attempt to fulfil a bizarre prophecy is thwarted by slapstick levels of incompetence.The final girl inevitably comes good although, quite rightly given the plot of the film, this is more by accident than design.If you don't fancy the political commentary undertone to this it's easy enough to switch off and just enjoy the glorious bloody mess. There's some very realistic injury detail and gore for the horror aficionados.",Ready or Not
192,edicionccq,"Are you ""Ready or Not"" for this bloody weeding?",7,24 November 2019,"""Ready or Not"" it's a weird movie. The movie is full of strange choices from the writers.
At first the movie starts really good. Excellent pacing, the plot is simple but it works, the jokes are funny and the fear is present. But the second half of the movie is just weird; there are a lot of changes in the way things developed. Some moments are so good for the horror aspect but then a joke appears all of a sudden. If you ignore the pacing of that half and the weird choice for the ending this is a good movie.The best parts of this movie are the characters. Every single one of them is pretty well established and the way they act is coherent with their personalities. Most of the characters, that we could consider the villains, are funny and has their reasons to do what they do and it's kind of convincing. The leading character is pretty good. You want her to win but also you want to see her suffer and fighting for his life. And believe, she will really fight for her life.The conclusion is ""Ready or Not"" is a weird black comedy with slasher. It contains gore and funny characters. The twists are decent and if you are into dark humor in killing, this will be good for you.",Ready or Not

-humor as dark as the night is blackAs others have noted, this is nothing prophetic, but it's a darn fun ride with some cool twists, turns, and great production quality. This is actually something I'll watch again, even though I know how it ends.For the life of me, I can't understand how anybody who read the description of this movie and then watched it, could give it a low rating. It's EXACTLY as described, but better. It doesn't make the mistake of lumbering on for 2 hours, but is a quick watch.A note for violence: some reviews comment that it is extremely gory. I did not find this to be the case. It is quite bloody, but for the most part, it's tame enough to allow folks who can't handle tons of gore to watch it, but meaty enough for gorehounds to enjoy it.

203,rmirchandani,A dark and twisted tale on family traditions!!,9,16 November 2019,"""Ready or Not"" is one of the best horror movies of 2019. It focuses on a bride whose welcomed in her husband's eccentric family. The movie is nor traditional or predictable. The twists and turns throughout the movie are all unexpected and shocking.The lead actress Samara Weaving who portrays Grace reminds me so much of Margot Robbie. The resemblance she has with her is uncanny. Grace had a quite open attitude to the family game/ritual, but that changed when she found out the true nature of it all.The levity in this movie was perfect and was not forced at all. It made some scenes more bearable to watch. I was at the edge of my seat throughout the entire movie and was not extremely fond of the gore and bloodiness depicted frequently in scenes. In hindsight, this movie is a horror movie and should feature these scenes.The twist at the end where Alex has a complete change in character and is on board with the whole family ritual was unexpected. I thought that Alex and Grace would escape together and never see the family again. In reality, Grace murdered Alex's mother and that drove Alex on a dark path and trying to fulfill the family ritual.The family failed to kill Grace by dawn, so they exploded. The house was haunted by the ghost of their grandfather. I thought that the family made all of this up. It was an interesting turn of events. It would have been quite anticlimactic if the whole family did not die.To conclude, ""Ready or Not"" is my favorite horror movie of 2019. It was a blast to watch this movie in the cinema. Strangely enough, the audience was not laughing at the scenes I found particularly funny. But everyone has different tastes.",Ready or Not

206,justinwfirestone,Funner than It,7,13 September 2019,"At a parsimonious 91 minutes, Ready or Not is about half as much of a movie as It Chapter Two, which trundles in at an unceremonious 169 minutes. If you consider the ticket was purchased with a student ID for a discount and a free 44oz. popcorn with buttery topping, it's safe to say Ready or Not is the clear winner of this summer's Battle for Your Dark Comedy Hard-earned Bucks.What if you were dirt poor and wanted to become rich through marriage to a family so wealthy they could kill some people now and then and not have any repercussions, either moral, ethical, or legal? It might involve sacrificing some of your own morality or sense of ethics, perhaps even a deal with the devil, as you learn more about what it takes to become part of an elite ruling class, with little to worry about other than what bottle of wine to quaff next.It's a slight gore-fest, but nothing nasty like a Saw flick or a Hostel pic. It might even be a more feminist statement than Mad Max: Fury Road, and for a dark comedy, it has a relatively bright ending.",Ready or Not
207,ScoobySnacks66,It's not pretty but it's bloody good fun,8,18 May 2020,"Incredibly fun and entertaining, Ready or Not is an intense and thrilling horror-comedy. When Grace marries into the Le Domas family she has to participate in an eccentric family tradition of playing a ridiculous game on her wedding night, but unbeknownst to her the game selected will pit her against the family in a deadly contest of survival. Samara Weaving gives an excellent performance, and is backed by a strong supporting cast that includes Adam Brody, Andie MacDowell, Henry Czerny, and Melanie Scrofano. And the script is especially well-written; particularly in how it sets up the game and works in several twists and turns. The dark comedy is also well done, with family bickering and comedic struggles with the bizarre collection of weaponry they use for the game. Wickedly entertaining, Ready or Not delivers scares, thrills, and a few good chuckles.",Ready or Not
208,joshbarton15,Thunderously entertaining.,8,29 September 2019,"Marital bliss, achieved through the matrimony of two people very much in love and willing to spend the rest of their lives together in sickness and in health, until ""death do us part"". In the hands of Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett, that death may come sooner than you'd expect into the marriage with Ready or Not, a thunderously entertaining black comedy horror.When Grace (Samara Weaving) and Alex (Mark O'Brien) become newlyweds, Grace doesn't get the wedding night she'd expect when Alex's family force her to take part in a murderous game of hide and seek in which she must survive the night to be officially welcomed to the family.If done right, films like Ready or Not can be absolute crowd-pleasers, as long as you go along with the lunacy served up by the filmmakers. Guy Busick and R. Christopher Murphy have conjured up a devilishly funny screenplay, full of put-downs as sharp as knives and plenty of gleeful violence. It's a film that wears its 18 certificate like a badge of honour, decorating the hallways with blood as the game of hide and seek ramps up in intensity, and it's really great to see a film not hold back in this sense.Bettinelli-Olpin and Gillett do a slick job of directing the chaos, Brett Jutkiewicz's cinematography opening up hiding spaces amidst the glorious country house setting for the film while Brian Tyler's score possesses an energy that accompanies Grace's fight for survival so fittingly.Samara Weaving may well look like Margot Robbie however, she's well on her way to attaining star status on her own merits thanks to a fantastic lead performance in Ready or Not, the combination of sheer terror and comedy she brings to the film no doubt making her a future icon of the genre. The supporting cast really do make this such a treat as well, Henry Czerny and Nicky Guadagni in particular going all out in the insanity department for our entertainment.I had an absolute blast watching Ready or Not, a film that will most likely be experienced best with the biggest audience possible.

We both loved the dark humor it was on point maybe could have used a little more but still was a nice balance. The violence and gore was well used and not really over the top till the end but used for some good humor. Little dissapointed the writers didn't go for a different ending for some characters but talking with my dad he dissagrees and felt the it was great and I can see his point of view.

What she doesn't realize is the family is bats*** crazy. Their great great grandfather (or something) made a deal with the devil (or something). They can be crazy rich, but have to play a game with a new family member is added to the group. Most of the time, the games are harmless, but if the new person chooses hide and seek, it's hide and seek to the death. Guess what Grace chose. What follows is Grace running and hiding for her life as the crazy family tries to find her in the huge mansion before dawn.Samara Weaving is just awesome as both a screamer and as comic relief as the movie itself switches from horror to dark comedy and back again. There's a good amount of gore, a decent amount of tension, and some quips that are funny because they're funny *and* because it's within a scene you wouldn't expect it to be. Weaving's comedic timing is great, with probably one of the best movie ending lines I've heard in a long while. The supporting cast is also great.It's not perfect though. Pacing was off a bit, I think. Not always, but in parts. And while I enjoyed it, I wasn't hooked -- there was something that just didn't pull me in as much as, say, The Cabin in the Woods.It's a solid 7/10 for me, though I can see ""other worlds"" versions of me rating between a 7 and 8.",Ready or Not

I laughed a hell of a lot, and all of the humor in it is kind of dark, but it works very well. There's a lot of scary moments, but not really any jump scares which is good. Scary films, at least recently, have relied way too much on jump scares. This one doesn't, and it's still scary. But the film balances the horror and humor very well.Why it all works is because of the actors. They're all amazing, actually, especially the main actress Samara Weaving. I don't think I've ever seen a performance as realistic as hers. She can really act like she's scared, and her screams are top-notch.Honestly, I would love to see a prequel, or a sequel that delves deeper into the mythology of it all.

226,asinyne,"very original, VERY gory...nice",9,5 September 2019,This movie is a wild ride. I picked it because all the others had already started. I was the only one in there. It was probably the most fun Ive had while going to a movie along since the original Road Warrior. It was tongue in cheek funny at times with a hilarious closing line. There is plenty of anxious moments for you to endure. I really enjoyed it. The cast was very good and kind of eccentric. The blood letting may have set some kind of a record. Not for the squeamish. But its all in fun and the sets are very creepy and cool. I recommend this very much for horror fans. The cast played it very straight...mostly....ha.,Ready or Not
227,cappiethadog,"She will survive, baby",7,29 January 2020,"The rich are different, Daniel(Adam Brody) admits as much to Grace(Samara Weaving), his sister-in-law for all of half a day. Daniel doesn't have what it takes to be a satanist, or a capitalist, for that matter. He lacks the killer instinct. ""Ready or Not"", directed by Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett, updates the ideology behind Ernest B. Schoedsack and Irving Pichel's ""The Most Dangerous Game"", in which Grace, the hunted, is clearly marked as the proletariat; not a relativistic object, an animal chosen by the hunter(Count Zaroff, played by Leslie Banks in the 1932 original), which happens to be human, because the normal rules of engagement need not be abided by if you're outside civilization's jurisdiction. The rich make their own moral universe. But Daniel is moral. He discovers his brother's wife in the pool room. The moral brother gives Grace a ten-second running start before he alerts the others, starting with Tony(Henry Czernas), his father, who is adamant about keeping the family's bloodline blue. The newlywed should have paid closer attention the underlying warning of her hubby's warning. Before Alex(Mark O'Brien) and Grace read their wedding vows, the groom says: ""I'm giving you an out,"" to his bride, who misreads the warning as being money-related. Grace misses the part where Alex never cracks a smile to reassure her that his apprehension is a joke. The family tradition is more sinister than she can imagine. As children, Daniel hid Alex in a closet the last time somebody had the misfortune to draw the dreaded ""Hide and Seek"" card. It was their Aunt Helene's husband, who died in a ritual sacrifice, but not before Becky(Andie McDowell), the boys' mother, let fly a strategically-placed arrow from her bow like an expert archer that kept Charles(Andrew Anthony) alive for the interim. The aunt(Nicky Guadagni), whose mien is suggestive of the proverbial woman with a grudge, has been waiting years for a night like this. Like Rosemary Woodhouse(Mia Farrow), wife of Guy(John Cassavetes), a struggling actor in Roman Polanski's ""Rosemary's Baby"", Grace's unwavering belief that Alex will deliver her from evil leads to disillusionment. Although bad blood with his family led Alex to flee the LaDomas dominion, in the end, blood turns out to be thicker than water, as they say, because the gaming empire family's blood is bad, especially, the blood of the black sheep.Daniel was slightly taller than Alex on that fateful night. You could say that he was the ""high boy"", running interference between Alex and the destiny he'll learn of on his wedding night. A high boy, in the furniture sense of the word, in ""Rosemary's Baby"", has been moved. Mr. Nicklas(Elisha Cook), the Bramford apartment building landlord, stands aghast; he knows that a hall closet exists behind the hulking cabinet. Guy rubs his face, as if annoyed at the old man for being so observant. But isn't this the first time he laid eyes on this place? Rosemary points at the outline. This annoys Guy, too. Rosemary would never guess that her husband's exasperation pertains not just to the landlord, who enlists him as a furniture mover, but because her deducing skills make them collaborators against a conspiracy plot that will become self-evident in the near-future. Landlord and wife have no idea what they just stumbled upon. The question of whether Guy's association with the cultists began that night as dinner guests of their neighbors, the Castevets(Sidney Blackmer and Ruth Gordon), or a long-standing one which resumed after a lengthy hiatus, was an open-ended one. Arguably, ""Ready or Not"" resolves this ambiguity, due to the film's resemblance in form and content. Guy knows Roman Castenet and his wife Minnie. He also knows about the ghastly history of that gothic piece of 19th century architecture. Hutch(Maurice Evans), their old landlord, is only wasting his breath. Like Grace's husband, Guy probably wanted a normal life. Slitting goat necks, a LaDomas family tradition since grandfather cut a deal with fellow traveler LeBail, the devil in disguise, chased Alex away, but relative poverty brought the prodigal son back to the fold, gambling that Grace wouldn't pull the bad card. Being one of the common people didn't suit him. Slitting goat necks notwithstanding, satanism is a necessary evil Alex willingly accepts as the cost of being a trustee to the family fortune. Faustian pacts are nefarious deals, naughty by nature, that are made to either procure money, or in the case of ""Rosemary's Baby"", fame; two drugs more potent than love, and worth killing over, for some. Guy, as well, ventured out on his own, wanting to prove himself as a stage actor with the right stuff, all the while knowing that if he couldn't establish himself legitimately, enlisting the help of Roman Castevet and his dark arts as a last resort was an option. An actor, the man who beat Guy out for the starring role in a play, goes blind suddenly, and the play's director calls his second choice to see if he'd be interested. As payment, the husband promises the cultists a baby, albeit with some acquiescence. A son, born stillborn, Rosemary is told, she refutes, not after the sound of crying comes emitting through those thin walls on a nightly basis. The dislocated high boy, refashioned into a barricade, Rosemary remembers, then quickly diagnoses, must block a secret passageway to her next-door satanists.Emilie LaDomas(Melanie Scrofano), already on the hook for two accidental kills; a governess and maid, makes it a trifecta of collateral damage when she shoots Daniel, her good brother. Without his ""tall boy"", Alex comes out of the closet, so to speak, and learns the truth about what sort of devilry he's up against, like Rosemary. She can tell by looking at her son's eyes that Guy isn't the father: Lucifer is. On the night of the impregnation ceremony, when that dessert with the chalky undertaste Minnie laced with drugs starts to have an effect on Rosemary's cognitive functions, Guy mocks his wife for added dissonance, relaying news from the black and white television about the pope's visit to Yankee Stadium. Rosemary is Catholic. His words are coded: Your god can't help you. The go-between can't help you. The Richard Connell short story ""The Hounds of Zaroff"", adapted into ""The Most Dangerous Game"" for the screen, is applicable. Guy could be a stand-in for the Count, who hunts her in baroque fashion. No bow and arrow, no gun: Guy depends on Rosemary's unconditional love for him as a weapon. The old men and women, nude throughout Adrian's conception, are the hounds. Does she fight back? No. Love is the most dangerous game. Rosemary joins the cult, agreeing with Roman that she should ""be a real mother"" to her half-humanoid son. God or Lucifer, Rosemary doesn't really choose either one. What ""Rosemary's Baby"" conveys is that she's possessed by her husband, choosing his obtuse convolutions to isolate her against the practical advice of cosmopolitan girlfriends, who all agree that Dr. Saperstein(Ralph Bellamy) is a quack. Go to Dr. Hill(Charles Grodin) they persist. But the internal physical pain, no matter how intense, because of her religiosity, the satanists know that Rosemary, their human game, will no doubt carry the little devil to full-term. Grace, on the other hand, despite her name, is a secularist; a position, guessed at, since the potty-mouthed young woman expresses no misgivings about her wedding being held outside the sanctity of a church. Since Becky, the groom's mother, gave birth to her husband, LeBail's heir apparent, the ""new me"", a moniker, previously though to have referenced the two women's shared experience of coming from humble stock, now means, the audience realizes, that the child she dams will carry the title of ""Grace's Baby"", second in succession to the LaDomas fortune and the throne of a fallen angel. With Daniel no longer alive to protect his younger brother, Alex learns that it was always his destiny to lead the family, which involves more than sitting goat necks. He has to sacrifice Grace. Does she fight back. Hell, yeah.Bob(Joel McCrea), the lone survivor of a yacht explosion at sea, makes it ashore on a small island overseen by a madman, in ""The Most Dangerous Game"", proving once again that the rich are different. Bob, a published author, who writes books about big game hunting, leads Count Zaroff to believe he has found a kindred spirit; a teammate instead of opponent. Zaroff, a Bolshevik, who owns the private island, dangles the proposition of hunting his two remaining guests: Martin(Robert Armstrong) and his sister Eve(Fay Wray). Bob flatly turns down the offer. Count Zaroff calls this game ""outdoor chess"" when it's Bob and Eve's turn to play. Bob gets a knife. Eve gets nothing to counter their common enemy. This outdoor chess Zaroff invented is a game meant for two human animals, mano a mano. The Count deeming Bob as a formidable opponent. With the woman, he's playing checkers.""I will play the ***t out of checkers,"" Grace declares before she goes downstairs. By the break of dawn, she gets to the other side of the board. The winner doesn't say: ""King me,"" but that's exactly what Grace does.",Ready or Not

So dumb cause well just read the story it's almost ridiculously stupid but at the same time so smart cause it knows what it is: pure fun entertainment. It never takes itself too seriously, it often jokes about its nature and it plays with it constantly especially with over the top dialogs and grotesque characters that fit perfectly into every, absurd, situation.
Situations where the lead character, the spouse (that Samara Weaving plays with tons of charisma), acts exactly how we all would have done even with smart decisions that rarely in an horror a protagonist takes.

It has a neat premise that toys with ideas of class, privilege, and entitlement all while, of course, reveling in comic absurdity and bloodshed. It doesn't have anything particularly insightful to say but hey, I'll take a novel premise over another Annabelle copy-and-paste job any day, regardless of how shallow the subtext. My issues, then, lie more in its execution: the cartoony and somewhat irritating quality of the characters, the limpness of the humor, and the lack of memorable set pieces. I walked away from the other two aforementioned films with a head full of stand-out gags and striking images. Here, the experience largely blended together and slipped by without truly shocking, scaring, or amusing me. Perhaps that's the fault of the direction, which is so crucial in translating a good premise into a kinetic, absorbing, and visually compelling film. Still, I can see why others may enjoy this and I do appreciate the original and playfully-executed concept. Perhaps it just wasn't my cup of tea.Strong 2.5/5",Ready or Not

238,WasiReviews,Game Night Meets Cabin in the Woods,9,24 January 2021,"Ready or Not is a horror movie that is both unique and entertaining with the film feeling like Game Night meets the third act of Cabin in the Woods ( not a spoiler). Samara Weaving and Adam Brody were great. I loved how incompetent the family was shown to be, it implies that the only reason for their continued wealth and success was the deal. Her dress getting destroyed symbolizes her innocence slowly fading due to the stuff she had to endure throughout the night. I think the fact that Grace is ""good"" is directly correlated with her getting the hide and seek card. The family worships the devil, therefore the original patriarch wouldn't want such a good genuine person to join the family. Notice how the other two spouses of the siblings aren't very good people, therefore they got to join no problems. Melanie Scrofano as Emilie Le Domas-Bradley, Daniel and Alex's cocaine-addicted sister was flipping hilarious I loved her soo much in this she felt like a dumb blonde character (she has brown hair though) but she isn't overplayed or overtly stupid like Madison in Zombieland Doubletap who I hated with a vengeance. Overall this film wasn't that scary but I will say it was thoroughly entertaining and incredibly gory this is not something a 13-year-old should watch. This is very much a satanic film with worship and brutality. Trust me the gore and devil references are very strong. All the actors and some Canadians (GO CANADA) brought their best act in this film. I can't name them all but I truly thought all of them were great in this film.",Ready or Not
239,C-Younkin,Close to being one of the better movies this year,6,22 August 2019,"Let's put it this way- there are dissapointments and then there are Ready or Not Level disappointments.Ready or Not is the new indie Hunger Games/Die Hard/You're Next-ish horror film from Fox Searchlight, I studio I constantly fear will suffer the same fate as the main character in this movie, just in this case, at the hands of a mouse.The movie centers on a young bride named Grace, who gets caught up in a life or death hunting game with her very rich and eccentric new in-laws.The game is hide and seek but once creepy Aunt Helene grabs a crossbow it's fair to say they don't play in the traditional way.A lot of questions arise over the course of the evening. How does Grace win? How does this family justify murder? How bad is the honeymoon going to be if you don't support your wife through your family trying to kill her?And what's surprising about it is that the movie makes a weird kind of satirical sense- that rich people so keen on getting away with things the rest of us can't will literally sink to any level to make sure they stay that way- even participate in something so supernaturally and superstitiously out there that you want to laugh at them.The ace in the hole here is not so much how bloody, violent, or scary the movie gets, even though it does have a good share of those, but it's actually how funny it can be.Members of the family are not just ridiculous but also downright lethally stupid- the cokehead sister may be my favorite comedic character this year.There's also great scenes involving Justin the most unhelpful onstar employee ever and one involving an almost dead person that feels taken straight out of Austin Powers.Other members of the family include a patriarch who feels like a evil cult leader, a matriarch who could either be friend or gravest enemy, a reluctant brother, and several murderous son and daughter in laws desperate not to return to the poverty they came from.And we root for Grace. The movie does well to put her through every test it can think of, from a nail to the hand to bloody scraps to disturbing and disgusting torments.It also does well to not revel in any kind of serious bloodlust, if she kills at all, it's usually for some kind of survival.However the movie is being billed as a revenge flick and I guess that description is apt but also kind of an overstatement. I felt the movie could have let her loose a bit more in the later stages.But the bigger dissapointment is that the movie could have ended on a great absurdist joke, that these people are in fact just psychotic from the disease called money.Instead it does something that feels like it was focus-grouped in to leave people walking feeling blood-quenched.It's a great satire and really funny comedy thriller up to this point but an ending that kinda robs it of the point it was trying to make about these people.",Ready or Not

248,Benslie,A unique and original story that's fun to watch,8,23 August 2019,"First of all, I wish this film was a bit longer. The film is one hour and thirty-five minutes, with credits, and I feel like if it was longer it would have helped it out a bit more. This is a slight spoiler but it's the opening scene so either skip over this or read it but the film just jumps straight into the film. There is no lead up into it, it just jumps right in so not till later in the film do we learn why they are doing this. So, I feel like a couple of extra minutes in this film could have helped it out. The acting starts out cheesy and kind of annoying but as the film goes on and the stakes get higher it takes a sharp turn and becomes pretty good. As the movie progresses you get to see which family members are fully invested into this and which ones would rather not do it. I will say that Grace is one of the most badass characters in horror and I was always cheering her on. I will say the editing in the film is kind of award at times and makes no sense. I say sometimes because most of the time it's edited just fine but in a couple of scenes it just jumps to a scene that isn't connected and almost feels like the directors were like, ""Shoot we forgot that one scene well let's just throw it in between these two scenes even though it doesn't make any sense to."" This film is a horror-comedy and I will say they balance the two well and a couple of scenes had me chuckling. The last thing I want to mention is the score by Brian Tyler is great. In the end, I highly recommend checking out this film at least once because it's a unique and original story and we don't have a lot of that now a day.",Ready or Not

251,richarddillomes,A movie about appreciating the in-laws you have.,8,26 April 2020,"Ready Or Not reminded me of a favorite movie from my childhood, Clue, a black comedy-mystery that was based on a very popular board game of the same name. The first thing that you will probably notice with Ready Or Not is that it has a personality. The mansion, the lighting, even the cast of kooky characters. Props to the casting director as everyone was well-casted, with Samara Weaving leading the charge and it was nice to see Adam Brody again. We should see more of him, I think he has shaken off THE OC dust bunnies at this point.There was no plan for me to watch Ready Or Not anytime soon but it kept popping up in different lists of movies to watch and there must be something to it if it keeps showing up way past its promotion period. Speaking of which, the trailer did not do the movie justice. The impression I got from watching the trailer was that it was a B-movie, and with a budget of $6million maybe it was. But being able to recuperate its budget on its first day of showing should be enough to change your mind.The movie for me felt short even with a running time of 1h and 35m. You know what they say when you're doing something and time flies by: ""You're having fun."" They could've stretched the movie a little more if they showed the drawing of cards of the other outsiders, Becky, Charity, and Fitch during their time. It could've added to the comic relief (I wonder how disappointed they were when Fitch drew a normal card) or trepidation when we pan back to Grace's turn. Now the denouement is where it gets tricky. While the movie received mostly positive reviews, there are those with mixed reactions because they felt the ending was kinda campy and somewhat a letdown. I mean I was glued to the screen from the beginning until the last 10 minutes because everything was hinged on the possibility of it happening in real life, then the ending came. I won't ruin it for you, but it's not for everyone. Some will like it, others might not. My proposed alternate ending would've been: they paid her a huge sum amount of money, sign an NDA and let her go. Then the rest died mysteriously based on the concept of the numerous board games the family dominion came up with. Sort of like a Final Destination montage. Then we go back to her reading of the family's misfortune all the way in Boracay, the sipping from her buco juice. Here's hoping we get a prequel.",Ready or Not

Adam Brody as alcoholic brother Daniel is fantastic and his vulnerability and torn relationships are a nice contrast to his bloodthirsty wife Charity (Elyse Levesque), who you cannot help but feel, if she pulled the Hide and Seek card, things would've been a whole lot bloodier, a whole lot quicker and brother in law Bradley (Kristian Bruun) who loves the family money but is a little bit more choosy and his instrument of death. Both Miss Levesque and Mr Bruun create very fun and watchable characters who add to the horror and fun. You also have Andie MacDowell, as the matriarch of the family who just wants to protect her brood.The film is fast, fun and bloody, you really wouldn't want to be a maid at this party - the tips you receive are on the end of a crossbow blot! There are a few queasy moments, a nail at the top of a ladder springs to mind and there's some awesome death scenes. A really fresh idea as well, which in the time of remakes and sequels is really refreshing, a hide behind your hands and count to 17/20.",Ready or Not

Well, the movie's central idea is not that new but the delivery of the idea, the pace and the performance of Samara Weaving really elevate this film. Entertaining and tense with comical moments that fit the genre, will make you follow almost all the characters in the film.

Ready or Not was not only an one-of-a-kind horror experience but it also had a powerful and badass female lead which made this movie even more enjoyable.

Hell yeah then u gave her plenty of time n chances to change her fate.

In some ways the premise is very similar in the uniqueness of what the story was and how really simple the idea is. Here we basically have a game of literal Hide and Seek to the point of saving the family from death of a deal brokered many years before. Execute the bride to save them. Cabin in the Woods; execute certain people to appease a god so the world won't end.

I'm not a fan of violent excesses, but the voluntary and involuntary murders in ""Ready or Not"" are absolutely hilarious. And when the supposed superstition turns out to be fact at the end, it's a pleasant surprise, as is the whole film, which for the first time after ""Braindead"" mixes horror and humour into an excellent cocktail.",Ready or Not

.
.
📜 Plot: A young lady named Grace (Samara Weaving) gets married to the love of her life and finally arrives at his palatial ancestral home to meet the family, but just when the meet-and-greet turns festive, she realizes that the family is involved in murderous hunting games, and that she's the prey.
.
.
👨‍⚖️ Review : Directed by Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett , this horror comedy is a slick entertainer. The premise is fresh, unique and gradually developing intriguing screenplay packs a punch. The film keeps you engaged even if the entire movie is shot inside a mansion with a psycho family running around to kill a girl. The dark and gruesome humour is a plus point of this very tightly edited movie.Samara Weaving is brilliant , she plays the bold character of Grace who rather being a damsel in distress , fiercely attends the situation to escape the environment. The Other Characters are extremely funny and have done great work.Overall , this slasher horror movie is a fun and entertaining ride which gives you chills and laughs while being Dark and Deadly at the same time. An absurd family, a cruel game and a newly wedded girl in distress all in all makes this one a worthy watch.

👍Goods :
1.Samara Weaving's Rock Solid Act
2. Intriguing Premise and fresh take on Horror Comedy
3. Tightly Edited Screenplay

264,ernestsavesxmas,A delirious delight,9,2 March 2020,"A truly delirious delight And you don't need to be a genre obsessive to appreciate. Sure there are gruesome moments but the pleasure is in the mostly comedic performances. If it strives toward some satirical idea, it's subtle enough. This isn't trying to be Get Out. It knows it isn't. It's big dumb fun and that's fine. The crazy ending sticks the landing as well.",Ready or Not
265,lucifer_over_tinseltown,"Baby, you're a rich man!",9,16 February 2020,"The truth about old money, the filthy rich, exposed with emotional honesty and fine cinematography. They are all bush-league Satanists. Samara Weaving's acting was so solid and on-point, I thought she was Margot Robbie for the first 45 minutes or so. The theory of why folks sometimes spontaneously combust is finally revealed in all of its perturbing and sanguine grandeur. More dark humor than a Cure album, too. Pretty cool seeing that dude from Sledgehammer again, as well. He didn't blow up the world this time (oops, was that a spoiler?).",Ready or Not
266,A_Llama_Drama,Ridiculously entertaining,8,13 July 2020,"Ready or Not has one of the most preposterous plots I've ever encountered. Thankfully, the cast and crew are up to the challenge of making the preposterous glorious.Grace (Samara Weaving) is getting married to handsome Alex. He's avoided his family for years, but now that he's getting married, tradition dictates he introduce his bride incumbent to the family (including Adam Brody as Grace's new BIL, and the fabulous Andie MacDowell as the matriarch). They're rich. They're really rich. They're also very sweet, if a little odd. Oddest of all is the fact that after the wedding, the family gathers to play a game. The game will be randomly selected and choices include ""Old Maid"" and ""Hide and Seek"" wherein the family will hunt the newly wed down and kill her. Guess which one Grace picks?No one is thrilled at the thought but tradition must be adhered to. Thankfully for Grace, the family hasn't had to kill anyone in generations and their weapons are all from the dark ages. Not to mention, the dynasty has come apart over the decades as the family wealth stagnated any development of the children, resulting in almost all family members being completely inept at the most basic task. Scenes of family members trying to operate crossbows, hunting rifles and even just swinging axes prove to be hilarious. Grace, thinking it's an actual game at first, provides a brilliant source of laughter and tension as she cartoonishly tip toes around looking for a hiding space while family members run rampant, trying to kill her.Besides the fun to be had at watching the Bluth family try to kill an incredulous Buffy Summers (without the superpowers), the film has a lot to say about the nature of tradition for tradition's sake, dynasty and wealth and who really deserves it. Especially poignant for our times when our leaders who have over generations gone to seed, carried to power by the nefarious (perhaps sometimes noble) efforts of their ancestors, are proving to be in need of a cleaning out. In one moment, clad in fighting gear, looking the picture of the revolution in her bloodied wedding dress, Grace doesn't strike a powerful pose for women or the underclass, instead she visibly flinches and balks, shoulders drooping, uncomfortably despairing at what's happened. It's a great, quiet moment in a great, loud movie.",Ready or Not
267,ElliesWonder,what marriage is like,5,2 January 2020,"Marriage is a real fight in life. It's more than just love and passion. (Especially for Chinese multi generation family.)Your marriage life would be miserable if you ignore his background and his family. Your life will be no better than playing the ""hide and seek"" with his weird lifestyle, nonsense family rules and mean relatives, there's countless guns and arrows will make you either surrendered or run for escape.The mother-in-law said she like you, but she would also harm you easily. Don't fight with your mother-in-law. Your husband might fall for you when you're in an disadvantage position. Men would promise you everything when he's in love. But he would also turn against you when you're not in his interest.He sweared, you're everything to him, he would die if you're gone.
Ironically, he was the one who put you to death in a marriage. You have to use your full strength to dodge the knives from your ex.Finally when sun began to rise, and marriage came to the end, your former lover turned back into a (hypocrite) gentleman and ask for your forgiveness. Every woman probably want to have a super power to blast him to death.So girls, are you ready or not?",Ready or Not
268,JamesIan2021,Fun!,8,29 September 2019,"Funny, superbly acted and well crafted, Ready or Not is an enjoyable dark comedy diversion, though it has no business being rated 18. Apart from a literal explosive ending, the rest of the movie floats by with a soft 15 rating at least, where most the violence is suggested or entirely cut away from. A few cuts and slashes here and there, but nothing that grisly. John Wick 3, somehow, is a 15, that has more eye-wincing violence and gore in its first 15 minutes than this entire 18 rated movie, so I was letdown in this department, considering that everyone is calling it a total gorefest, but hey it's still an entertaining enough flick.",Ready or Not
269,helenbassett,Ready Or Not Film Review - Matt Bettinelli-Olpin & Tyler Gillett Direct Samara Weaving's Bride & Seek Massacre Among The Dumbwaiters & Dead Maids,10,5 October 2019,"Directed by Matt Bettinelli-Olpin & Tyler Gillett, Ready Or Not opens 30 years earlier with a terrified groom looking for somewhere to hide. With great frantic photography by Brett Jutkiewicz. Given away by young Daniel, he is shot and dragged off. But the film's not just a film about the rich hunting the poor, it just so happens that present day new bride Samara Weaving's Grace is poor. She could have easily been a rich girl and fallen in love with Mark O'Brien's Alex. Looking for a Happy Family finally to belong to. Not their riches.But as Grace is poor her new husband's family believe her to be a gold-digger. For this is the Le Domas dominion, one of the most illustrious families in America, having made their money in board games. Scratch Cluedo and Scrabble for best sellers such as Family Ritual and Survive. This is an 18 after all! But anyone can tell you that Monopoly can get quite heated, Mayfair trumps Old Kent Road, just as the board goes over.After staring down the new in-laws , Grace makes it through her nice day for a white wedding day. Nicky Guadagni is a terrific Aunt Helena, she'll look great with a Grim Reaper's axe at Halloween! It was her husband shot those 30 long years ago. No wonder she seems scary. And as she appears in Grace and Alex's room that evening she suggests that Grace will have to be better at hiding. Because the wheeze of this family is that when a new member joins, they have to play a game.Turns out family legend tells of old man Le Domas meeting a traveller back in the days of the Civil War, and receiving a box in exchange for promising to make his gaming fortune. The stipulation that every new member must play the game on their wedding night. As family members arrive to play, the evening seem harmless enough, What's Old Maid? asks fish out of water Kristian Bruun's Fitch. That was the game he had to play when he married Alex's sister Emilie. Well Grace is ready to backgammon the hell out of them.Nervous anticipation round the room at midnight, and then deathly silence, as Grace pulls Hide & Seek out of the box. Of all the games in all the world. But game as she is Grace goes off to hide in the dumbwaiter. Just how a bride wants to spend her wedding night she muses. As the Le Domas family arm themselves with weapons of Grace destruction. Don't let Melanie Scrofano's Emilie near the gun. She's a complete coke head!Bridegroom Alex is in shock, in playing Hide & Seek the family must kill the new family member before dawn. But determined to save Grace he grabs her as they hide in the bedroom, just as a maid comes in. And Emilie thinking she's found Grace rushes in after her, and shoots her in the head. I told you! We're hunting the blonde in the wedding dress! So heads or tails! As Grace realises that this hide and seek may not turn out well for her. Alex explains he didn't tell her before they married because she wouldn't have married him. You think. But the chance of Grace getting the Hide and Seek card....So run rabbit run rabbit run run run as Alex's parents played by Andie MacDowell and Henry Czerny round up the family. It's a hunt to the death. And they're having a blast, even if they're a bit rusty at it. And those weapons are antiques. They don't come with player instructions.Alex's brother Daniel finds Grace in the library, a Cluedo favourite, he'll give her a 100 start. A bit lax with his counting though. Adam Brody's Daniel is tired of the family games, but his wife Charity, played with little, by Elyse Levesque, is blood thirsty. Anyone would think the Hounds of Hell were after them. You have to have sympathy for this old blue-blood family. It's a movie so just go with it.And a bloody horror that delivers on the gore, written by Guy Busick and Ryan Murphy, it's not subtle but it's hilarious. Lovely Samara Weaving dryly works the comedy, and you can see the rusty nail horror a mile away, but it's a shotgun blast of a movie. (Sadly they're just for show). And wicked fun. Production design by Andrew M. Stearn was just creepy enough in a rich person's home is my gothic castle.And as dawn breaks I had to wonder about last man standing at this shotgun wedding, and the family succession, now that would be an interesting outcome. In laws are crazy, but some are seriously rich!There's your meek will inherit the 1%'s earth.As a follow up I want to see all the family games being played in Le Bail's Gambit.",Ready or Not

It looked amazing and i just had to see it. Well now after seeing it it kinda was as expected and it did as it was supposed to and it was good. I really enjoyed the ending it had a weird twist but it was good and cool. I mean there is a lot of twists in this movie which are cool. There was also a lot of good kills and creative kills in the movie as well. The idea is quite nice and i really thought it was a good idea. This movie feels like how movies nowadays are supposed to be like and it has that modern feel to it. The acting was great and it was really good. The characters were all great and some of them were diverse and had their own ways. There is also some comedic parts which is funny.

Amazing camerawork, lighting and performances by the lead actors especially Samara Weaving makes this movie a memorable one. Even though the movies is kind of predictable but the execution and narration will keep us engaged. Tyler Bates Background score was an added advantage.

277,hiraishinnojutsu,Absurdities after absurdities saved by hilarious ending,6,8 September 2019,"I called it absurd because while the writer or director could actually make it into a pure thrilling terror with fear, much blood, and evil motive behind all the sinister actions conducted in this hunger games style hide-and-seek, they decided to execute it in a more comedic style. Some people might like it, I don't. To think that the bad guys keep making stupidly laughable mistakes, despite their lives on the stake (and some of them don't even want to play it but hey, it's their lives or the others'), make this movie seems less evil, less gore and I can't quiet find such fun in such movies. It's okay if you want a happy ending where the victim survives, but at least, make it terrifying, make the effect on the victim lasts forever. Despite all of that, I kinda like the ending, it's pretty funny, even though it's pretty horrifying (kinda remind you of how Dr. Manhattan from 'Watchmen' (2009) kills people).

278,NDbportmanfan,A Humorous Game of Chase,7,10 September 2019,"Ready or Not is about a newly wed bride that has to play a game in order to officially be welcomed into the family. The game that is chosen is hide and seek, with the catch being if she is found... well you can tell from the trailers.The one thing this film really does well is keeping the tension high while also supplying well executed humor. Which is vitally crucial in a silly premise such as this one. The sister's husband plays a role that embodies the audience as he is questioning the games logic, pageantry, and real end game. His humor along with his wife really makes the movie memorable.Much like real hide and seek the entire thrill comes out of the high tension hiding moments and the sporadic running scenes. These are thrilling and they felt more intense because the writers wrote a character that seems a little deeper than other scream queens of the recent past. We are even given a character in Daniel that helps carry the story when she isn't in the picture.Once we get past all the thrill and kill moments comes the third act or more importantly the end. This had all the momentum going into it from the previous scenes, but the end just falls flat. Honestly they should have added another 20 minutes to this as I would assume audiences are wanting more to the lore, or maybe that is just me. Where it stands now its okay because it was out there and few probably would expect it but you will go away thinking it had a lot more potential.This movie should be watched but there is nothing spoiler heavy that waiting until a home release wouldn't be the most viable option. I can see myself watching this one again in the future.",Ready or Not
279,FixedYourEnding,Ready for a down-to-earh review?,4,3 December 2019,"Hear me out. Ready or Not is NOT a good movie.
Seem some people actually like it, but it still doesn't make it good. Unfortunately, no matter what you say somebody is going to disagree with you. Is it a comedy? I don't know, it was trying to be funny at times but I did not find it funny at all. Is it a horror film? It is gory at times (people getting their head popped off) but it is not scary at all. Seems even the directors (Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett) couldn't agree on that, or maybe the writers wanted to make a comedy and the directors wanted to make a horror film? either way the result is a nearly-unwatchable B-grade movie which disappoints on all possible levels.The characters in this movie are caricaturesque, but not in a good way, they just appear to be stupid. Their actions and reactions to event seems to make no sense. Even the lead actress Samara Weaving who looks promising at the beginning is becoming more and more annoying as the movie goes on (stop screaming for heaven's sake!) and the ending is just idiotic.
I would honesty be ashamed to recommend this movie to anyone, I can, however, recommend V/H/S (2012) by same directors if you are actually looking for a good horror movie. Bottom line: watch the trailer and save yourself 93 minutes of agonizing screen time.
Exact score: 38/100",Ready or Not

This is the game each new member of the family has to play to insure its future prosperity. Usually the game is harmless, but Grace pulls out ""Hide and Seek"", which means her in-laws are supposed to hunt her down and murder her before sunrise...READY OR NOT Is a tongue in cheek horror movie, as satirical as it is terrifying. Playing with the concept of murderous in-laws it shows to what extreme one has to go through to belong to a new family. Samara Weaver fills the shoes of a fragile heroine who quickly learns survival skills in a labyrinthine gothic mansion, when like many newly weds she realises there's no happily ever after.The film has a perfect pacing and a great cast, each of them with some memorable idiosyncrasies that make them very much alive. Adam Brody, a divided brother of the groom is a show stealer, and Andy MacDowell shines as the family matriarch and a reluctant killer. Her character's transformation in the film is the most interesting one.The soundtrack by Bryan Tyler is incredible and is the heart and soul of the film.

The problem is that even with a very nice cast the movie jerks between the two themes never really transitioning smoothly. At times it feels like the direction was ""okay this time we are going to kill someone for laughs"" or ""in this one the murder is serious"". It's one of those movies that you find that you never heard of and after watching it you understand why.

289,wlee08,The Most Dangerous Game,9,15 September 2019,"As crazy as they come. Not sure why I liked this so much - maybe the color, the music (classical), the thrill of the chase, the folkloric story rooted in the classic short (and black and white feature) ""The Most Dangerous Game"".
This is The Most Dangerous Game if Tarantino got his hands on it. So in some ways the initial develpment is a bit predictable, and not always fully credible, but those would be the only weaknesses. You'll have a good laugh if you're into black humor. You'll have a jump or two from the edge of the seat. Bends a few genres in a similar way to movies like Cabin in the Woods, Get Out, or maybe even Mother!, but is probably a bit funnier than all of those",Ready or Not

295,Abranth-d,Didn't see that coming .,7,13 September 2019,"Here's my review of 'Ready or not' . So 'ready or not stars Samara weaving who happens to be a Margot Robbie lookalike . The movie's about a girl who marries into a super rich family who have a tradition of playing a game , one of which involves playing hide and seek but the other members of the family have to kill her before Dawn . That's just about it. It's a neatly directed claustrophobic horror movie which has elements of black comedy in and out. That's something I loved about this movie. The tonal shift from funny to scary to weird is so fast in this movie and yet doesn't feel odd anywhere. The music was also gripping and helped with the setup for most jumpscares. I don't usually talk film school , but the lighting in this movie was gorgeous . The only gripes I had were with the use of shaky cam in certain scenes . Other than that , it was a pretty good b grade flick with gore , action and thrills. The ending however ... That was unexpected .",Ready or Not

304,soundoflight,Modern un-untelligencia,2,2 September 2020,"""Ready or Not"" is billed as part comedy, part horror, however it takes itself way too seriously to actually work as a comedy (or isn't actually funny, or both), yet is far too slap-stick and clichéd to work as a serious horror film.Good horror films all have one common thing in common: they lend themselves a certain creditability so that on some level at least, you start to wonder if it's real. You start to feel creeped out and afraid a little. Those kinds of films make you check the back seat of the car before you get in on the way home from the theatre. ""Ready or Not"" has none of that.So we are just left with this meandering romp that maybe works for the first 1/3 of the film, where it carries a little promise, but completely lost me after that and I just didn't care what happened to anyone after that. In many ways, this movie is a good example of everything that is wrong with modern filmmaking. Films used to be made for grown ups, with grown up themes, and grown up ideas. This, on the other hand, is just silly slap-stick for 90 minutes (that feels a lot longer). What's next, ""Football in the Groin?""",Ready or Not
305,pedroquintaoo,Very good,9,22 August 2019,"It's a really intense thriller full of thrilling scenes and a lot of twists, however suffers with its trailer that showed a lot of spoilers and important scenes. I also loved the cinematography, the character development, the acting, and the scenarios, the technical aspects are almost Oscar worthy.The weakest thing in my opinion was the rushed ending, I would give more 10 minutes instead to finish the movie in a bloody and fast way.Avoid the trailer (or try to forget it) because it shows a lot of important scenes and some funny jokes. Because Ready or Not is surely one of the most thrilling experiences of this year.",Ready or Not

I find most of the them eye rolling and skippable. However, this one works on every level, Samara Weaving does a great job in the lead role and the script doesn't turn her into a total Mary Sue. The story is straight forward and fast paced, the humor and gore strike a good balance and there is just enough tension and suspense to keep you into it until the final scene.",Ready or Not
315,gooseshaw,Lots of potential but brought down by some clichés and bad choices.,7,1 April 2020,"So for one thing, I don't know why Alex (the husband) didn't tell Grace (his new wife) about this whole tradition. He says he loves her but apparently not enough to tell her about all of this. In the end though, he turns and tries to kill her after seeing her kill his mother, who was in turn trying to kill Grace - so I guess the husband just didn't think this through very well? And yes, obviously I realize the movie wouldn't have happened if the he had told her, but come on.That was one twist, which occurred after the husband broke out of his capture by sawing the wood of his bed frame using the chain of his handcuffs... I don't think that's physically possible but whatever. The second twist, which was a clichéd but also one of the movie's saving graces, is that the unenthusiastic brother (Daniel) of the husband finally accepts that his family are all terrible people and deserve to die. He poisons his family somehow, but we never actually see it unless I missed something, and this ultimately buys the protagonist some time so that she can survive until dawn at the last minute.Honestly though, everyone in this movie, even the hired help (who all end up dead anyway), are all absolutely terrible people, with the exception of the protagonist (Grace) and I guess the husband's brother. And not only that, they don't even have any redeeming qualities. You hate them all throughout the entire movie. And that's not a bad thing, it just made the happy ending more necessary and predictable - not to say that this movie's trying to throw many curve balls.I was disappointed by some of the poor character choices and also the fact that we don't get to see the bad guys suffer for their actions a little bit more (they literally just explode instantly without even feeling anything). Alex begs for forgiveness but we already know he'll explode too so it doesn't really matter. Also, early in the movie they introduce secret passageways in the house, and then use them once and never again.I suppose that kind of summarizes the movie really. Good ideas that perhaps weren't used to their full potential. However, the movie is entertaining and the protagonist is fun and likeable. I found myself routing for her the entire time. I would recommend this movie if you want a fun, albeit slightly sloppy entertainment ride.",Ready or Not
316,babybuletgani,Tradition dictates that when someone marries into the family,6,1 November 2019,"Tradition dictates that when someone marries into the family, they must select a card on the night of the nuptials (after all, this bunch got rich selling board games) and play whatever it suggests. Poor old Grace picks a deadly game of hide and seek - and she's soon fighting for her life as her new in-laws, led by parents Henry Czerny and Andie MacDowell, hunt her through the house. While there are spoiler-heavy reasons for the carnage, the tenuous plotting from scribes Guy Busick and Ryan Murphy is really just an excuse to watch Grace try to survive the slaughter - alternatively, if you've ever wanted to see MacDowell in a full-blown punch-up, this is your chance. Coupled with some on-the-nose satire of the weird 'n' wealthy, the results resemble a blood-soaked Trading Places. Co-directors Tyler Gillett and Matt Bettinelli-Olpin (anthology movie V/H/S) keep it brisk and ballsy, while Australian breakout star Weaving (niece of Hugo) makes for a compelling lead as she emerges from her shell. The lurch towards an over-thetop CGI-heavy finale doesn't entirely satisfy, but Ready Or Not otherwise feels fresh, funny and absolutely crazy.",Ready or Not
317,MissCzarChasm,For the Horror Fan,10,25 November 2019,"You know that when a film garners this much hate and reviews which call it ""Sick, sick, sick"" and ""disgusting"", and go on and on about how all the ""violence is towards women, blah, blah"" ... it has to be something special.And this one is.It is resonatingly (yes, I made that up) witty and really quite funny. In fact, it is almost too funny to be a ""horror"" film, and although it was certainly gory, it had nowhere near the gore of most horror films. It was just right IF you are looking for a film to satisfy the horror-seeking fan in you and which makes you laugh at the same time. In my book, the best of both worlds.As for the reviews which mention violence towards women: get over it. I'm a woman and I detest women like these reviewers who demand to be seen as something more, but then fail to live up to being able to 'take it'. Grow up. You give real women like me a bad name by association.In closing, this is one I highly suggest you watch for yourselves and make up your own mind about, but go in knowing that there is humor in it and hardly any scares.

319,KaZenPhi,Utterly useless.,3,12 April 2020,"I've seen copious amounts of much worse movies that still had interesting elements in them that might make them worth a watch.
Now Ready or Not, I wouldn't even watch again on a plane.It starts with the most dangerous game premise we've all seen before, which wouldn't have been such a deal breaker if we didn't start with the game already being played by the rich Eyes Wide Shut weirdos and if there was more creativity to, well, everything in the movie basically. Five minutes into the movie there is literally nothing left to discover. All the plot points are shakily entering the frame clutching a walking frame and you have to sit there and deal with it.I love horror comedies but as a general rule of thumb exemplars of both individual genres tend to be terrible for the most part, it's even rarer to see both combined successfully. As you can tell by my rating I don't think Ready or Not hit the jackpot.
The comedy isn't funny, the thriller elements aren't suspenseful or tense. In a desperate attempt to make this movie appear to have any edge there's lots of swearing, which might impress a kid with conservative parents who gets flogged for saying ""hell"" instead of ""heck"" but to me it was just tiring. There's an art to profanity big and small. Tarantino-material this is not.So, what else is there? Some quickly aborted attempts at class commentary, a couple of uninteresting kills for the easily impressed, a single splendid haircut, depressingly serviceable production value and a pet peeve of mine, something I call the Idiot Plot. A plot that can only happen because everyone in it acts likes a complete idiot.Ugh, I feel like I aged a year watching this.Most aggravating of all, this movie comes off like the makers thought they were making something smart and subversive. Not only are you trapped in a room with someone with bad gas, no, he also loves the smell of his own farts.",Ready or Not

321,heykateforever,Pretty Good for a Horror Movie,9,8 December 2019,"The difference between this horror movie and about 99% of the others is the tongue in cheek humor and the great actors who somehow manage to make you laugh in the midst of full on gore. There is also a bit of a cautionary tale mixed into this one with the children involved in the mayhem that engulfs this movie. It does NOT glorify the gore, nor does it completely ignore the wrong-headedness of what is going on. But somehow, it manages to be, to me, way more entertaining than the Chuckie movies or the Saw movies which seem to be steeped in gore without conscience. It definitely makes fun of rich people, something I have absolutely no problem with since they do encompass our Congress and run the world in reality with little regard to the middle class, the poor, or the elderly, etc.And perhaps that is why there is a lot of downrating going on. I guess a lot of people want their gore without any tugs on their guilty consciences! The actors were all superb, especially the leading lady, Samara Weaving and Andie MacDowell. I was pleasingly surprised at the humor and horror mixed just right by Ms. MacDowell in this very different roll for her.The script was tight and excellent. The director did an great job getting just the right mix of humor and evil out of this group. It was an oddly engrossing film for the genre. I actually like horror movies, but rarely would rate one above 6 stars because they just aren't that good. This one is the exception. If you have a weak stomach for blood, definitely not for you. But if you enjoy a good horror film with great acting, directing, special effects, and a story that will not leave you wishing you had watched a Hallmark Christmas movie instead, this one is for you! One of the best horror films I have seen. If it gets the momentum from movie watchers, I see this one becoming a classic in the years to come! Definitely recommended.",Ready or Not

Among the few satisfying moments of this dross is when she slugs the kid who shoots her in the hand: nobody wants to admit it but the potential of children to be evil is high, something they learn from adults very early on.

336,iamianiman,Are you Ready to rumble on your wedding night???!!!,7,22 August 2019,"Ready or Not is a fresh take on the slasher genre. It crafts a creative arch on the basic storyline concept that is rarely done in movies with similar genre. It is not the typical house invasion or vacation goes wrong.Ready or Not serves a plate of dark comedy that escalates as the run time goes along. What makes this so great is the general get to spot each laugh easily, not just its specific target audience.For a slasher film, Ready or Not deserves an applaud for its remarkable acting performances by the cast. Everyone shows their distinct characters from behaviour to costume that they are so entertaining to watch similar to that feeling when you get dozens of characters to choose from in a game.The lead character, the one who you will be rooting for is created in such a way that she is not dumb like in most movies. However, she is not smart either but the circumstances make her character safe from the trap of being a daft person. In other words, the movie does not unravel her intelligence nor her ludicrous manner.Also, the lead character has little to no character development. The fundamental question of her historical context and background is extremely lacking that we as the audience fail to connect with her as humanely as possible.The biggest complaint has got to be the rushing third act (final 30 minutes). The first two acts peel its layer off one by one steadily but the third act however loses its balance and goes downhill. They tried to do something completely different but it fails to satisfy the audience because we want something more pleasurable than what they have given us.Verdict: Ready or Not is a phenomenal gem that breaks the stigma free of 'slasher genre is dead'. However, it is not considered a masterpiece although seems very close due to its disastrous third act nature that falls short compared to the other two acts.",Ready or Not

If you're not too smart this type of comedy is probably very humorous to you.This movie gets a solid 6 which is highly generous because many movies out there are a lot better than this junk with lower ratings on rotten tomatoes.,Ready or Not
343,sampah70,You won't feel cheated by stupid jumpscare or panic open lock/car start cliche.,8,26 June 2020,"Most horror/thriller always have stupid cliches just for raising tension without anything to do with story line, that kind of under aged kid tried to scare someone: BOO!
This movie won't cheat you that way, their acts and what's happened are pretty natural and logical albeit a bit comical as intended; this is a comedy afterall.
The actings are pretty good, I can say excellent. Storyline also well, enabling character development a bit with many turnarounds, and ending was acceptable/good, though not spectacular.
I will sure expected to watch more movies from the director and writer. If anything they missed, since profanities seemed to be very casual today, their habit seem also slipped through the movies they made. Much less for people in high status (like they are in this movie), any decent families will never openly says foul words like nothing.",Ready or Not
344,zeionara,Fox has found a heap of rubbish (expectedly),6,1 December 2019,"Watched this movie just because already have watched everything better which is more or less easy to find, and what I can say after watching is that my impressions of trailer and plot description were fair and this picture definitely suffers from ability of providing anything valuable, interesting and beautiful.
What we observe is just another ridiculous speculation on the same theme, and even with similarly crooked title, as was ""You're Next"". There is also an unreasonable mixture of comedy, horror and something just silly, so the movie doesn't make at least a drop of sense and after watching is forgotten in the nearest week or like so. Moreover, there is no outstanding performance no exciting memorable music no unique visual composition or director's viewpoint. The ending just makes you cry and feel sorry about spent time on this rubbish.
However, as some efforts were put into production of this film, in the whole there is a cohesive structure and there definitely were some unpredictable turns as well as enough amount of violence which was not overobviated during the script, it deserves not the lowest rank.",Ready or Not
345,LBarlane24,Best horror comedy of the year (so far),9,29 August 2019,"Ready or not stars Samara Weaving (whom you may recognize as the titular girl from The Babysitter) as Grace, a young woman whom has just married the son of a wealthy family. Said family seems nice at first, but there is actually more to them than meets the eye. As soon as the wedding ends, both Grace and the family have a seemingly casual get-together. They recommend playing a game with her, and the game just so happens to be 'hide and seek.' But little does she know, the game is a much darker and deadlier tradition in the family household.What I liked most about this film is the portrayal of the main heroine. Instead of being a blank slate, she is very charismatic at the start of the film. And when all hell breaks loose (literally and figuratively), she is able to dig deeper into it while fighting for her life.Another thing I liked was that not all members of the family were homicidal maniacs. Besides the wedded husband (who later betrays Grace at the third act), his brother Daniel is the one who later comes to Grace's defense. At first, he comes off as a know-it-all d-bag. But as the film progresses, he turns out to be the most sensible one out of the family.Now that I've praised the film, are there any gripes that I have with it? The short answer is 'kinda.' As soon as we are introduced to the main heroine, she is shown to already be wearing the wedding dress and just so happens to already be inside of the house. Not that it was a bad introduction in any way, shape, or form, but I can't help but wonder how she and the family (and even her wedded husband) met in the first place; I might be nitpicking, but that was a portion that I felt was missing.Last but not least, the theatrical release poster, as it clearly shows the main heroine wearing what appears to be a large bullet holster. This would lead the audience to believe that she'll use a gun at some point to defend herself, when, in reality, she carries a rifle once, but never manages to shoot (anyone) with it; she does kill one or two people in the film, but not with a gun.Overall, the performances were terrific, especially from the lead actress (Andie MacDowell looked phenomenal, especially for her age), and the ending was both disturbing and hilarious at the same time. this is my second favorite movie of the year so far, and I'm giving it a solid A.",Ready or Not
346,kikoydaba3,a flawed attempt in satirizing wealth and tradition,6,5 September 2019,"Occasionally interesting, griping and visually dark in concert with the thematic subject, Ready or Not is a flawed attempt in satirizing wealth and tradition in a family setting.Grace Le Domas, played by Samara Weaving, is newly wed with Alex (Mark O'Brien), a member of a wealthy family who secretly practices satanic rituals. When a person is married to a Le Domas, the family initiates its new member by undergoing a game of card drawing. Whatever game comes out of the box, the new member and family does. Grace unfortunately draws hide-and-seek, which ultimately results in death for the new member. Ready or Not follows Grace as she aims to survive until dawn.The film's strength lies on the unapologetically dark, shadowy and moody visuals. Most of the scenes are shot with minimal lighting, presenting a setting of horror steeped in old money. However, the narrative has serious issues because while Grace is a strong character, her development as the film progresses shows little depth. The supporting characters are stronger because the events peel off layers that motivate them to be part of the Le Domas. Daniel, played by Adam Brody, the brother of Alex experiences the most progression because of his successful betrayal of family tradition. Ready or Not therefore suffers as a whole because the themes should enhance the main character. Instead, we see Grace most of the time running without providing an additional layer to her character.Ready or Not is a unique approach in the dark comedy genre without becoming derivative.6/10",Ready or Not

356,napchier,A bit lacking!,6,2 October 2019,"This is an 18 (UK), though I don't know why. Seeing 18 - strong gore and violence - upped my expectations somewhat, and I felt a bit flat to see only a few holes, and spurts of blood here and there. There are a few body explosions, but nothing different to exploding things in ""Stranger Things"" recently, which isn't an 18. Anyway, I would suggest you simply watch the trailer, and leave the rest to your imagination. It's okay, maybe 6/10, but your imagination might give you a better experience.The family in this film just wasn't odd ball enough. There's one slightly off the wall aunt, and a coke addled sister, but otherwise nothing to give the movie what should have ideally been a household full of all sorts of crazy people which, depending on a range of differing odd characteristics, may have served the comedy aspects a little more, and some areas of horror too. Has a supernatural aspect that for me could have been left out, though I suppose it justifies the change to otherwise seemingly normal behaviour, bar a few exceptions. Also a bit odd that the person being hunted, for a game of hide and seek (this is all in the trailer btw), NEEDS to be alive for an organised portion of the proceedings later on, however the family go hunting for her with weapons that would likely lead to them accidentally killing her, rendering a reportedly necessary event to occur later in the movie unlikely, cocking the whole thing up. All the blood in here for the most part stems from botch ups in trying to secure the person hiding, so seems like their approach was a little short sighted.I would suppose if they were so invested in a particular outcome, they may as well have just played a regular hide and seek game, had a drink to celebrate the end of the game, the person hiding (now found) being rewarded a sedative laced drink to make doing the whole end bit easier for them. This is after all a comedy horror though, so I don't suppose it helps to apply any logic to the proceedings.",Ready or Not

370,thenextrushmagazine,The Halloween flick of the season!,6,22 October 2019,"It was customary for ancient civilizations to gather at the colosseum and watch the brut force and perverted excitement of chase and attack between gladiators, fighting to the death. The decorum of today's modern society has refined itself to the easy low expectation pasttime of a good old fashion psychology thriller and slasher film which in this film took the game of 'hide and seek' to extreme levels.There's a general formula we expect when it comes to horror:1. the reliving of a past memory, a trauma triggered by an anniversary - tick, we're given a glimpse into the past in the opening frames that sets the course of two brothers and the roles they play within their family2. mind games, murder chase sequences - tick, the bride to be strangely enough, meets her in-laws for the first time and ends up with all of them out to kill3. a triumphant hero with an opening to a sequel or displaced happy but satisfying 'happy' ending - tick.For fans of the horrorfest, it's got the comedy and humor of the Addams Family and Scream, the intricate family dynamics of Dynasty and Downton Abbey with the feminist touch of The Last Jedi and Dark Phoenix. It takes the dream wedding day, locks it into a multi million dollar mansion, hands all family members an antique weapon and turns it into a disturbing game of survival for the bride as part of her initiation into the family.The Le Domas family are the fictitious equivalent of Milton Bradley or Parker Brothers have made their billion dollar empire on board games and fittingly so, a tradition for new members entering the family is to play a game. Sometimes it's chess, sometimes it's Old Maid, but every now and again, it's a deadly game of hide and seek as part of some age old pact the patriarch of the family made with the devil a lifetime ago.Ready or Not takes this formula, twists it up and plays it out with humour, mysterious back stories setting up the intertwined complicated history while managing to reel us into enough of an emotional investment to keep us guessing who will be the heroine's night and shining armour.The accidental deaths of the hired help served (see what I did there) some of the funniest moments throughout the film as bodies pile up and family loyalties and relationships are tested throughout the hunt. It's really over the top with a somewhat reasonable ending but the build up is what makes this film to be the one to watch over the Halloween season with its cartoonish humour that turns every kill into an act of empowerment.",Ready or Not

This definetely has the vibes of a first-time director, but you can really appreciate the effort and creativity they've put into their work.
The story is quite simple, and the location is tight, which gives them a lot of room to focus on what really matters - writing, humor and cinematography.The characters are well written, and more importantly, not stupid. Everyone behaves as one would in this scenario. Each character has a distinct trait, that plays well in they family dynamic. They're unapolegettically one-dimensional, but the script and the actors work cohesively to make them memorable.The cinematography is beautiful - its set in a mansion, which again is a very effecient for the budget. They incorporate dark lighting, and faded shots to really push for an 1800's ambience.The plot is an excellent example of effecient writing. Even though there's a lot of crazy stuff happening, this feels real; like this is how people would behave in the situation the movie concoted for them.
The directors choose to explore certain themes using black comedy, which flow really well within the story. In this case, we get a glimse of the rich, elite families,who are so above the norms of realtity,that they've distanced themselves from any sense of humanity. It explores how money can literally give you the power to do anything withou conviction, and the effect that has on your morality.If you get a chance, check this film out. Its paced really well at 90 minutes, and is funnier than it is fear. I'd compare this to a less intense version of Get Out, with a similar premise, but different styles of exectuion.",Ready or Not

383,abhijith-alpha,Samara Weaving is the new scream queen of Netflix.,6,2 May 2020,"READY OR NOT: A REVIEWThe movie is about a young woman marrying into a rich and eccentric family, who force her to play a deadly game on the wedding night to be accepted into it. Samara Weaving plays the poor bride who fell in love with a rich guy, who discovers, to her shock, that her in-laws want to kill her before the sun rises on her wedding night.The idea isn't exactly original. The direction is somewhat listless and tries to rely heavily on horror movie tropes. The actors try to make it convincing but this is a group collected on their good looks more than their abilities. Compounding the issue, the weak screenplay and weird lighting and colour grading saps the performance out of even a seasoned veteran like Andie MacDowell, the most well known among the cast. This movie has bits and parts that work for it, but overall it was a letdown. The twists and turns of the scripts were telegraphed miles before they arrived; the physical comedy and horror wasn't distinct enough to compensate for the unoriginality; the character motivations were predictable and overall falls flat.Weaving tries her best, one of the young actors with good screen presence. Her performance is caught between the unlucky young woman running from an unfair situation and the vengeful bride a la Kill Bill. But her strong screen presence is wasted here in script indecision as she shifts back and forth between these two personas too many times to weaken the arc. Surprisingly, Adam Brody, whose character started off as the stock irresponsible brother, is the most realized character in the movie, and was the only one who held my interest every time he was on screen. His inner turmoil, the wrestling between emotions of guilt and shame, and loyalty to the family, is a good example of an actor making the best out of the limited range his script originally allowed him to do.Most movie tropes are present in ""Ready or Not"", the lucky girl, the sensitive rich guy who hates his rich family, the sneering matriarch, the charismatic and scenery chewing dad, the practical and in-charge mom, perpetually drunk brother, in-laws varyingly ambitious to spoilt, professionally creepy family butler and the unfortunate maidservants. Unfortunately the director seems to have stopped halfway between making the film a truly great horror film that also provides scathing social commentary. The movie seems to have settled into a middle path between proper satire and shallow commentary on the state of the world. Considering how much the ideas of the callousness of the rich towards the less privileged have been expressed well in many horror movies, and the overall script had the wherewithal to deliver it, this movie falls short for me. Sometimes, fun and gore, packaged somewhat competently, isn't enough for me to rate a movie good. This movie is good, but only by a small margin. I wouldn't watch it again.FINAL THOUGHTS
What a waste of an opportunity. All the ingredients where there, just not in the right amounts.Andie MacDowell looks weird. I blame the editing and the lighting.Adam Brody is really good.Some of the cinematography is really good. The inside of the mansion, in many scenes, is simply beautiful.RATING 5.5/10",Ready or Not

387,redroominparis,Bad execution,4,16 June 2020,"Very poorly written, loaded with bad talent. I'm shocked Andie McDowell agreed to this. Adam Brody is ok, because he's doing the Adam Brody thing he does. The main character, Samara, spends way too much time growling and screaming in such a way that made pause it to watch you tube videos. It also seemed like the directors recycled scenes. I think they were going for shock value? I'm not sure. I guess the strengths could be set design, tough lighting job but pulled it off nicely. Worst, absolute worst performance by far was the Grandmother. You could tell the actor was extremely uncomfortable with the garbage script, cliche lines. She probably is classically trained and needed the paycheck. It was probably fun to shoot though.",Ready or Not
388,tpkrause1,"Fun, Original Horror!",7,26 August 2019,"Although the movie was absolutely original, it had a fun 80's horror vibe -- not like the 80's slasher, but the off-beat ones like April Fools Day or Truth or Dare. Also, it had a fun mash with Clue or something, or like an old play about rich people and murder. You have to love the casting when Ryan Murphy is involved, like what a great random role for Andie MacDowell. On the whole, some great characters. I liked the strangeness so much that I wish there was even more of it -- so much of it was so original that for me it made some of the tropes stand out, mostly evident in the more straightforward suspense/chase stuff. I liked the kitchen scene but could have sensed more danger if that character were stronger/scarier. I think the cocaine could have had more of a payoff. I think the passages could have, as well, or in general, the house could have been more of a developed ""character."" It looked great, what we got to see, but it never got claustrophobic enough, or didn't seem sophisticated enough to trap someone. Also, I think the main girl could have done more damage, but she was very beautiful and I bought her choices throughout. Same with Adam Brody, I bought it throughout. Fun movie!",Ready or Not
389,spotboyfilms,An average horror-comedy flick with a good lead actor,6,26 August 2019,"At the very basic level, this is a fun entertaining movie and if you like horror comedies, it's worth watching. For me, watching it on the big screen doesn't lend anything extra because the cinematography and direction are not exceptional in any way. The trailer for this movie gave too much away and so the initial reveal of what's going on feels unimpactful. The film also seems to have dumb antagonists. The bad guys are simply not very good at being bad. There are also no side plots, so the storyline is straightforward survival-mode. Samara Weaving is very engaging as the lead. Despite being similar looking to Margot Robbie, Samara Weaving is clearly a much better actress and has potential to be one of Hollywood greats. At the end, this film is everything the trailer shows and nothing more. It's a fun average film. 5 out of 10 plus 1 star for originality.",Ready or Not

Samara plays a woman marrying a guy with a very hostile/secretive/questionable family. The fact that she has to play a game after getting married is ridiculous. If I were her, I'd be like ""whatttt?"" But once it gets going, man it just goes. You're rooting for her the entire time. And that ending! Man it's kinda confusing to understand, but google helped explain it better to me. I got a Heathers vibe from the final shot. No sympathy for the rest of the family, just Samara's character.

She embodied the character and the emotions in each frame she has been outstanding. The dialogue delivery from start to end she has exceeded her expectations. Even the other characters like Daniel and Becky the mother has done amazing. Each cast has played their role very well.The story is unpredictable and very thrilling.

The film centers on Grace (Samra Weaving, who looks uncanny like Margot Robbie), is about to get married to Alex La Domas (Mark O'Brein) and to her In-Laws, The creepy La Domas Family. When the wedding is over and their honeymoon is about to begin later that night. Alex explain to Grace that she participate in a Traditional game that has been in his Family for generations. She learns quick about what to take place.
The film packs with a lot of blood and macabre humor. It's really good to see Andie Mac Dowell returning to the screen and Henry Czerny (Sharp Objects). There are some fun scenes but the idea of the film is that it's a survival game and that's all I'm going to say. But you will be rooting for her through the film.

All hail to the casting agencies who can find the perfect face for the perfect character. What I like about this movie, while it may not be exactly a horror story is its realism that is only violated in the very end but then it is executed which such perfect justice and accompanied by such ironic laughter from Samara that whoever came up with it is totally exonerated for its in-credulousness. This is a dark movie, bodies are drawn from the living at a steady pace and the killings are as brutal as they are fanciful. A head is chopped off with an ax I will give you and for the rest go watch it thank you very much. There's a dark kind of humor to psychopaths and this movie is full of it. The cringing, hurting moments invoke true horror because you can so easily relate to them, the strength of those scenes is that they are so close to the bone, the spine is a bone right? The movie stays close to the face of the main character, which is always a satisfaction when it is a pretty one, and in our desire to understand it we are exposed to all its evolving expressions as it attains more grit while the story develops in an ongoing escalation of violence.

Unfortunately for the family, this new bride isn't one to just sit there and take it and she's going to put in the fight of a lifetime.Ready or Not mixes humor, slasher flick tropes, and old dark house creeps to great effect with wonderful performances and a few funny zingers throughout. It's hard to imagine horror fans not having a good time with this. It offers enough gore to keep them happy while giving more mainstream audiences a good dash of humor to keep things from getting too relentlessly dark.",Ready or Not

Likeable characters at first. Clueless bride slowly (understatement) begins to figure out something is amiss with her new inlaws. Fairly quickly turns into a nonstop chase that begins to bore. Interspersed with creepy humor. The ""humor"" involves the senseless killing of several employees of the family. Not very funny to repeatedly see the villains callously killing people and smirking about it. This movie would have been better without this type of humor. The person being chased must not have ever seen a horror movie before! If she ran like her life depended on it rather than as a soon-to-be dead teenager in a Friday the 13th movie.

It just wasn't as good, the suspense, the gore, the kills and ending just didn't live up to my expectations. I predicted the ""twist"" early on, I knew a real paranormal curse would get them at the end. I thought the lead actress did a great job carrying the film and being mostly believable. She certainly drops the ball multiple times by leaving two guns on the ground. She's seems to be more lucky than skilled at surviving. Thankfully the comedy in the film was dark, dry and not too much. It lightened the mood at times and helped the pace. I think atmosphere, suspense and sets all could have been improved. There's certainly room for changes that would have kept me on the edge of my seat. Maybe a twist I didn't see coming. Instead they delivered a solid forgettable flick.

480,gustavobacelar-64245,Games,8,8 April 2020,"Ready Or Not was a big surprise for me. Its plot revolves around aspects of horror films, acid humor and survival. It is the first contact I have with the duo of directors Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett, and what I saw was very pleasant and fun.
The characters are a mixture of people with strange archetypes with a deepening of a very discreet personality. Kristian Bruun's characters, Melanie Scrofano, Henry Czerny, Nicky Guadagni and John Ralston don't go beyond the line of character archetypes for a big depth. They are very shallow in what they propose, sometimes funny when it suits and convenient when the script needs it. They didn't captivate me and therefore aren't widely remembered for their deeds. The characters of Mark O'Brien, Adam Brody and Andie MacDowell are the ones that stand out for having well-established backgrounds and distinct personalities. They create their disagreements between the three because of their personalities and purpose that move them the during the plot.
The highlight of acting goes to Samara Weaving who builds a smart, courageous, brave character and full of intermediary between these characteristics. We see a growing trajectory in his personality. If at the beginning of the film we saw that she already had these adjectives, throughout the film they potentialize themselves by becoming something incredible and coherent. Unfortunately your character is not so lucky even though your choices are the smartest for a horror movie. This character is wonderful.
The story is very interesting with its rules and the crazy things that the script delivers to us. In my short stay on Earth, I didn't see many films in those aspects, so I can't be sure that the script for the film is original. The costume reminds me a little of the old times and I found the green and yellow colors interesting.
Ready or Not is an entertaining film, it's interesting, containing a protagonist different from many others of the genre and that captivates those who watch it.",Ready or Not

484,kevinthecritic-15200,Ready or Not: A Bloody Wedding Invitation You Don't Want to Pass Up,8,24 August 2019,"4 out of 5 stars (One of the best of the year)Ready or Not is the horror-comedy I've wanted all year. A combination of The Most Dangerous Game and Get Out (but minus the latter's political messaging), this is a fun, darkly humorous horror movie that balances solid gore and well-placed comedy without breaking its intensity. Add a great lead performance by Samara Weaving (of Netflix's The Babysitter), and Ready Or Not is a fun, bloody way to cap off the summer season.Grace (Weaving) is set to marry Alex Le Domas (Mark O'Brien), the son of an ultrarich family who aren't thrilled with his choice of brides. After an awkward wedding reception, David informs Grace of a family tradition in which new members play a randomly-selected game from an old box that lasts from midnight-sunrise. She draws Hide and Seek, and is shocked when the family starts hunting her across their large estate with guns, crossbows, and other medieval weapons. Grace must evade her pursuers and figure out why they want her dead, uncovering a dark family secret along the way.Ready Or Not strikes a surprisingly effective balance of tension, gore, and humor. While the first act is somewhat slow-paced and awkwardly written, the film kicks into high gear once the game begins and stays there until the bloody end. Weaving brings realism and humanity to the craziness around her, and the score is pleasantly creepy. Andie McDowell, Henry Czerny, and Nicky Guadagni are great fun as the father, mother, and creepy aunt, and the film thankfully addresses its potential plot holes rather than simply ignore them. The kills are gory without overstaying their welcome, and the well-placed humor deflates tension while still taking the danger seriously.Ready Or Not is a fantastic example of how to meld gory thrills and dark humor successfully. With a great cast, creepy score, and strong lead character, this is a standout movie that deserves to be seen. If you enjoy movies like Cabin in the Woods or Evil Dead 2, I implore you to see Ready or Not. In a landscape dominated by reboots, superheroes, and political soapboxing, Ready or Not reminds us that original movies can be good old-fashioned fun. See it.Rated R for Violence, Bloody Images, Language Throughout, and Some Drug Use",Ready or Not

Let me just say this. The movie is not perfect. The main character is not always perfect in her decisions. Seeing ""normal"" people getting crazy because of the card is not that believable.

494,micheleroncarati,A hidden gem of mediocrity and cliches (not it's not funny),3,25 December 2020,"I've heard people stating, ""this film is a hidden gem and if you don't get it, it's because you do not understand the comical side of this film, which is silly and light on purpose."" In my opinion, it's a film that falls under the category of ""silliness for silliness sake. I am smart because I can enjoy brain-dead silliness"". Also, a film can be silly and light, but it doesn't need to be corny and stupid.I think that this film is not funny, not even funnily silly. Let's start with the plot, it's quite simple (which isn't always a bad thing): this film is about a young beautiful woman that in the beginning of the film is weak and stuck in a relationship with a moron. Thus, the story becomes a ride that empowers the woman as a strong independent character that fights of the greedy and messed up family of her partner. Weak woman -> bad partner + greedy family -> bad stuff -> strong woman. I get that there are people who do not want to put much effort in what they watch, but it doesn't mean that this film is a hidden gem.As many have said, the plot is pretty silly yes, but it's not the main issue, the main issue is that the comical scenes and the jokes are very corny, almost cringy. I feel that only a first grader might find some scenes funny, and not all of them. For example, something that happens often is a character doing something and then making and edgy remark. It is not even a good edgy remark, it's just crap. This film takes loads of scenes and phrases from other films and mixes them up and it pretends that it's a witty silly film.I also find quite annoying the corny trope of the weak woman stuck in a bad situation that overcomes her fears and shows to her partner and his family that she is a strong independent woman. If I was a woman, I would like to see more complex and well-rounded characters even in film that is purposely light and comical. Being a dark comedy with an absurd plot does not mean that the film needs to go down the road of trashy clichés with edgy phrases and scenes. I have enjoyed other films that are in the same category of this film, but this one made me only cringe. Most of those that liked this film are either fanboys/girls of the main actress or simply enjoy braindead cringe. If you are not a teenager and you have left your puberty behind, then this film is a waste of time.",Ready or Not

502,RennerFilms,"FUN idea, GREAT start, TERRIBLE finish!",3,3 December 2019,"I was really looking forward to this. It started well and I liked the characters for the most part. I was laughing quite a lot, which is not necessarily a good thing. By around the halfway mark I was starting to dislike it a lot, then everything went to hell (not in a good way) in the climax. What I didn't like (SPOILERS obviously:):-the lead has no backstory/character. It's mentioned at one point she had a foster family and we get that she doesn't come from a rich family but that's it. We know nothing about her. Same for the groom. ""Get Out"" set up the characters much, much better.-I kept expecting the bride to ""go Rambo."" The trailers seemed to imply she was gonna be a badass. How cool it would have been if she had a secret past (ex-military?) that even her fiance didn't know about. Nope. She just lucks her way through the film mostly.-I was looking forward to seeing the rich family knocked off one-by-one. Nope. We got one kill (on purpose). Which leads me to...-Having the entire family explode at the end? Ooookay. Kinda funny, but a huge wasted opportunity.-Having the finance turn on her at the end was kinda of a cool idea, but the scene with the fiance and his mother made this nonsensical.-the whole supernatural aspect made no sense. Why mention that Alex had seen the ghost(?) of the business partner if that's not going to be a pay-off. The whole backstory with the great grandfather and his partner was not set up well. So Mr. Le Bail was supposed to be the devil? Were the family aware of this?Anyway, I usually blind buy DVDs but luckily I saw this, um, elsewhere so won't be purchasing this time (even though I'm a huge horror fan!).",Ready or Not

Was it maybe a little predictable? I guess. But knowing where the story was going didn't stop me from enjoying the ride.Samara Weaving did a great job in the title role. Unlike a lot of films of this type, she doesn't just go from wilting violet to gun-toting war machine in the blink of an eye. Her character really goes through a complicated series of emotions and encounters, and the film wisely gives her strong scenes with the characters of her husband, her brother-in-law, and her mother-in-law. Even the more secondary characters are given distinct personalities and motivations, and so despite the sprawling cast I knew exactly who each character was and it added some impact to the violent scenes when they arrived.Adam Brody is really good as Daniel, the brother who reluctantly participates in his family's cruel traditions. I didn't even recognize Melanie Scrofano (I know her from Wynonna Earp) as the coked up sister-in-law, but she was hilarious.Without venturing into spoiler territory, I found the film to be violent and bloody, but not cruel or depressing. A lot of the violence was darkly funny, and the actors are generously doused with blood and gore. It has some broad themes about what people will do to become rich or to stay rich--a criticism of both rich people and the non-rich people who are willing to do horrible things to climb the ladder. But the film isn't overly concerned with delivering a message, so the broadness of its themes didn't bug me.Movies are always better on the big screen, but I would highly recommend this film as a rental--especially for a movie night with a group of friends.",Ready or Not

With how much of a focus there was on hidden passageways in the beginning, I thought we would see more of that when Grace was actually hiding. I wanted more hiding, and less ""running into a room, getting caught, running to the next room.""The movie was not as suspenseful as I was hoping it would be, nor did I find it very scary.

Grace is a brilliant actor, pulling off the role beautifully. Too often in films like this, the protagonist seems to just readily accept the messed up situation, or they suddenly turn from normal person into action hero. But Grace was appropriately scared from start to finish and I believed her performance. That's partially due to the script as well for giving enough space to develop genuine character moments.

However the idea that binds this movie plot, family game, is not explained enough. So seeing all the characters beleiving the trashy story about their grand-parent and his games, and following the non written and unexplained rules and killing without any remorse, made me feel confused and puzzled.
It was actually never explained why the hell in that house happened what happened.

How films in this genre are cut, how suspense is ratcheted up, especially in a game of cat and mouse , are core to the audience feeling terrified and sitting in the edge of their seats. In this case I kept waiting for the tension to build but it just didn't. The same with the score; apart from the spooky song that is played the rest of the mood was not impacted by any noticeable score or music.

549,nickrichardson-16919,POPCORN EMPIRE: Ready or Not - Movie Review,9,19 September 2019,"""Ready or Not is... a crazy, off-the-wall film that feels refreshing among the many sequels and reboots of this year."" 8.5/10Ready or Not is a horror-comedy starring Samara Weaving, Adam Brody, and Henry Czerney. The film is packed with plenty gory action and dark humor, with a dash of socio-political commentary. it's a crazy, off-the-wall film that feels refreshing among the many sequels and reboots of this year.Warning: Spoilers Ahead!When Grace (Samara Weaving) and Alex Le Domas (Mark O'Brien) host their wedding at the Le Domas family mansion, things quickly take a turn for the weird. Once the wedding ceremony is over, Alex explains to Grace that she must play a game as part of family tradition. After Alex's father Tony (Henry Czerney) fills us in on some of the family history, Grace is presented with a small black box full of cards. When Grace pulls a card from the box, the game will be revealed. As luck would have it, Grace randomly selects the one possibility that the whole family was dreading: ""Hide and Seek"".This is no ordinary game of hide and seek. Grace must hide within the mansion until dawn, while the Le Domas family hunts her down and tries to kill her as part of a twisted ritual. Arming themselves with old rifles, crossbows, knives, etc. the De Lomas's reluctantly begin their hunt. Grace is not informed of the details, believing this to all be a silly game - until she witnesses one of the maids being killed in an unfortunate accident. At this point, Grace realizes she's trapped in a tense game of survival as she tries to out-maneuver and outsmart the Le Domas family.Much of the humor comes from the De Lomas's who, despite being the antagonists of this story, are merely hunting Grace out of obligation. Half of them barely know how to use their weapons (one even takes an extended bathroom break to watch YouTube videos about crossbows), and even more simply want the whole affair over with, silently believing that the ritual is made-up nonsense. This anti-trope results in a lot of back-and-forth bickering and petty insults being passed around, and it's hilarious watching these characters struggle and fail to kill Grace time and time again. While the dialogue isn't always polished, there's plenty of funny lines and situational humor, as well as over-the-top violence and gore. If you have the stomach for both bloody violence and gallows humor, this film is right up your alley.Grace is resourceful, witty, and charming, and she makes for a very compelling and like-able lead. Many members of the De Lomas family are intentionally portrayed as out-of-touch, clueless, rotten, psychopathic, or all of the above, making it all the more satisfying when Grace gets the upper hand on them. Samara Weaving gives a terrific and layered performance, showing bravery and resolve when need be, but also embodying the trauma and hysteria of the situation at the most crucial moments, especially when the film reaches its (literally) explosive climax. She's an innocent, seemingly harmless bride turned badass ""girl power"" action hero, and her transformation throughout the movie is immensely satisfying to watch, especially when someone in the De Lomas family gets their comeuppance (in the form of a gruesome death).Ready or Not clocks in at a tightly paced 95 minutes, having fun with its premise without stretching it for too long. The film constantly has its foot on the gas, keeping its momentum going with humorous gags and well-executed action sequences. The plot is fast paced and consistently engaging thanks to the efficient editing.This is not a film for everyone, but it's wonderfully subversive and well-crafted. While it's reminiscent of other horror-comedies such as Get Out and You're Next, Ready or Not has a distinct style of its own. It's likely one of the most fun moviegoing experiences you'll have all year.8.5/10",Ready or Not

It was all nice and fun to watch at but what happened with the ending? They really messed up there because the ending was some kind of magical thing and destroyed the whole movie.

Although you get glimpses of what to expect in the trailer, the cinematography, production design, story telling and acting is worth the whole 1 1/2 hours of madness. The whole plot of the movie revolved around Samara's character and she played her part in an immaculate manner. Round of applause for doing that as her acting and dialogue delivery is the reason that kept the movie together. The movie never felt as a B grade thriller. It genuinely invested in the whole game we witnessed. The supporting actors are well casted. Blood and gore made it somewhat not kids friendly, yet more enjoyable as the stakes are much higher. The climax of the movie is such a rollercoaster of a ride. I liked the turn of events and the dark comedic touches they added throughout the movie. Especially the dialogue at the end is like one of the most perfect and badass ending I have seen since long. You can't stop smiling of what the hell just happened. A very well balanced movie!

581,hamanoooo23,Trash,1,28 August 2019,"Not gonna lie, the concept seemed interesting and original with potential. However, execution was terrible. It starts off well with proper horror vibes that kept me on the edge of my seat right until the first 'accidental' death of one of the maids. It was at this point that I knew it was going downhill. By the time they got to the third maid's death, I was ready to leave.The excessive comic relief scenes were completely unnecessary and made me cringe. I still don't get how/why movies try to incorporate comedy in horror films because they're two conflicting genres that defeat each other's purpose. What's worse is that the characters were extremely unfunny and the deaths were ridiculous, therefore taking away the fright factor (if it existed).But the worst part has got to be the ending. So they were right all along and as a result, they all died in a comical way? Ha ha? We barely got to see any kills in the movie. Why kill all these characters in one stupid scene instead of using them to make a good horror film with several separate deaths.Overall, the movie was absolute garbage. Seemed like a mix of Get Out and the Cabin in the Woods but A LOT worse. All the high ratings are probably from teenagers or people with low IQs that find comedic horror films 'entertaining'.",Ready or Not

Now, you have the bride, quite literally the dumbest character in the whole movie I almost rooted for her to die. There were two instances where she could have grabbed a gun from her attacker on two separate occasions but she didn't. One of these attackers was a 7 year old boy. She knocked the little boy out and completely dismissed the gun she just got shot with.
Apart from her being so dumb, surprisingly she was the only good actor in the whole movie with perhaps Adam Brody being a close second. Everyone else felt forced specially the old lady who relied heavily on her wardrobe and makeup to come across as an evil b-word. Her acting was forced and cringey.

The family made their fortune by creating and producing board games and all those stuff.Every time, at midnight after the wedding ceremony takes places, this family has a ritual in which they play a board game.
This time, they play hide and seek and the goal is to kill the bride. (Let's kill the bride, what's more fun than that seriously?)The story was unusual from the beginning when the creepy aunt Helene was introduced. But anyway, I know it's a comedy movie but it wasn't a very cogent one. Everything is so absurd not in a funny way, but rather in a silly way.The absurdity is that they wanna kill the bride joyfully with pride but when they shoot another random person they feel sorry for them. The plots are replete with so many stupid and illogical scenes. To compound the stupidity, a little kid has a gun and tries to kill the bride. Later he was asked why you shot her & he replies ""that's what everyone else was trying to do"". But he was in his room from the beginning and he had no idea what was going on, so how does he know about the game?""Ready or not"" is regarded by some viewers as a laudable and fantastic movie, which sounds so ridiculous to me.

610,metaCity,Samara Weaving leads ensemble cast in bloodthirsty comedy - great,7,29 May 2020,"Being rich seems easy. All you have to do is sell your soul to Satan, make the occasional human sacrifice, and money and privilege are your forever. Unless the latest victim turns out to be the final girl from hell, in which case the whole house of cards falls apart and burns to the ground.
Ready or Not is one of the last releases from Fox Searchlight Pictures, keeping its remit of high quality, low budget film production going right to the end. The film creates a fresh story from familiar ingredients as grace, played by the charismatic Samara Weaving, marries Alex and meets his rich family. She soon learns that tradition comes first with old-money types, as she spends her wedding night being hunted around the family mansion by her new in-laws with a variety of antique weapons. Not that they intend to kill her this early - that comes later when, after maiming and capturing her, they sacrifice her to Satan.
The family fortune comes from selling games of chance and the opening image shows Satan's grinning face surrounded by dice, playing cards, and a roulette wheel in a nice graphical foreshadowing of the story, where it is revealed that the le Domus family really do have a deal with the Devil. Each new family member has to pick a card at midnight, pick the wrong one and they must be hunted and sacrificed before dawn, with dreadful consequences for the family if they fail.
The ensemble cast is a major reason Ready or Not is so watchable. Samara Weaving takes us with her all the way from living the dream to surviving the nightmare; Alex is ambiguous right to the end, veering one way then the other in his wife vs family dilemma, we can see both sides of his guilt in a well-balanced performance from Mark O'Brien. His brother Daniel is full of drunken loathing for himself and the family, will he sober up in time to do the right thing? His wife Charity is the anti-Grace, fiercely committed to the family that has rescued her from some unspecified hellish past. Alex's sister Emilie is a ditzy cokehead who shouldn't be let near a tin opener, let alone a gun, her husband is a lazy chancer who married a rich girl so he would never have to get a job. Old aunt Helene, deliciously played by Nicky Guadagni, is demonic and bitter to the core, but also the funniest character in the film. Henry Czerny is the oddly sympathetic patriarch, his long-suffering demeanour a symptom of his ultimate responsibility for, literally, keeping the family alive. Andi McDowell is still a class act, although she doesn't have much to do. John Ralston completes the main cast, playing the family butler as part accomplice, part concentration camp guard. All the characters are given room to exist, with just enough dialogue and sharp observation to bring them to life.
Much credit goes to the directors and scriptwriters. They have all created a film that encompasses comedy, horror, and thriller while keeping a consistent tone and packing in a lot of action. Let's hope the demise of Fox Searchlight doesn't make it more difficult to produce smaller budget, well-crafted films like this.",Ready or Not

Once the set-up is done, it's basically just one long chase movie, where the crazed in-laws of a newly married bride attempt to hunt her down in a deadly game of hide & seek. Samara Weaving turns in a very good performance in the lead role, effectively portraying the change from lovestruck innocent to bad-ass, battle weary heroine. There's plenty of gory violence & gags to keep audiences interested, although it's never that genuinely scary or tense - but because it doesn't take itself too seriously, it gets away with it. A decent supporting cast with the likes of Adam Brody and Andie MacDowell seem to be having a lot of fun with the material and while it's not in the same class as say an Evil Dead II or Shaun of the Dead, there's still a lot to enjoy.",Ready or Not
613,beavis_el_bunghole,Annoying and so derivative you can see the last line coming from the very beginning of the game,4,16 June 2020,"You think this is a bizarre premise at first, but once you finally accept it and try to enjoy the dark comedy, all the cleverness is already gone and you know exactly how it is going to go (excepting perhaps the second to last scene, which I assume was the genesis for this script) as the constant and inexplicably bad decisions of the lead character amount to nothing more than a distractingly gory slasher flick posing thinly as a comedy that gets more and more annoying and predictible with every passing moment. As soon as the lead tears her dress up, you can guess exactly what the final line of the film is going to be and the pathetic lame joke she is going to make. The more I think about it, the more infuriating and derivative this whole thing is. But, at least there is that 2nd to last scene to bolster the film as a comedy.Bryan tyler does his best at an obnoxiously ironic ""comedy"" score mixed with dark string ostinatos and some nice orchestral moments and atmosphere.With that being said, the acting and directing are also actually very good, but it's just a slasher flick at the Bilderbergs house.

You are going to get Grade A directing with B movie like story. I enjoyed this movie and would see again. I clicked this movie when i saw Margot Robbie on the cover art only to discover it wasn't her, but a doppelganger. She proved to be a good draw as did everyone else including Adam Brody, Andy McDowell, Henry Czerny.Only gripes I had were the servants being involved and killed by accident. When I see these movies, I allow myself to be absorbed into whatever world they are presenting, but the director still has to be honest and with hired help involved in ritual killing, I couldn't buy into it.

It has some plot in it that keeps you wondering how this is all going to end. This is a survival game for the lead female character. The way that she keeps herself alive is kind of exhilarating. It has a sense of feminism in it that young generations of female should fight for themselves and stand up against traditions, especially those non-sensical ones. This is a strong comparison to the other older females in the movie who just buy in to traditions.The ending is quite out of the expecatations though and made quite a laugh (at least to me).If you want to get thrilled, you won't be dissapointed.

630,somewhatarian,Wants to be 'You're Next'.... fails,1,22 June 2021,This movie is awful. It's not funny. And that's why. As a horror comedy it has to at least deliver on one of these elements. Samara Weaving's acting is... well it's the scripts fault. There's really nothing going on here. This could've maybe been a 30 minute episode in an anthology series or something-although I don't even think they have enough material for that.This is not 'You're Next'. The main character is insufferable. She's not resourceful; she's useless. There are WAY WAY too many scenes that serve no purpose and just drag on the run time. It does not accomplish anything. It doesn't provide commentary nor is it satirical. It doesn't seem to strive to do anything.,Ready or Not

636,lluewhyn,"Interesting idea, but execution lacking in creativity or thrills",3,13 September 2019,"While the concept of The Most Dangerous Game involving a woman against her in-laws is somewhat original, the execution of this film is bad.Problems:
1. This is probably the most undeveloped main character I have ever seen. You learn almost nothing about her history or desires, which makes it really hard to care about her more than the fact she's being chased by murderers. Most of the characterization and time is spent with the family members, who are the villains, and almost all of them are pathetic.2. The profanity in this film is over the top. The characters probably swear twice as much as a Tarantino film, and with a lot less creativity or impact. It would be funnier to hear the ""blue-blood"" family start swearing once things start getting so bad for them, but all of them are swearing left and right from the beginning of the film so there's no escalation that makes the profanity interesting.3. The film teases out a class struggle at the very beginning, with the protagonist concerned about marrying into this upper crust family, but along with the swearing from #2 these family members really don't act very high class at all, the main character Grace has a posh accent that doesn't make her come off as lower class, so this plot/theme goes nowhere at all.4. It looks like the filmmakers were trying to make this more realistic at times (but not consistently so), so the main protagonist has no special combat skills, ingenuity, or athletic ability. As a result, too many of her ""successes"" are pure luck or someone doing something stupid. As a result, this film pits the Unremarkable vs. the Unintelligent. This isn't that exciting.5. There are really very few interesting set pieces, probably due to lack of imagination or funds. The action appears in short, boring bursts, and there's no visual wow factor. You get the feeling they didn't have much in the way of stunt coordinators.6. A related problem is that you never get a good perspective of the mansion or grounds, and with characters wandering in and out of the plot at random, you never get a really good perspective of how difficult it would be to ""seek"" Grace. The film just meanders from room to room, and the tension of the hunt just dissipates as a result. I'm guessing they just didn't have the funds to acquire a good interior location for the set.",Ready or Not

READY OR NOT is definitely that movie.What could have been a very straightforward slasher film about our heroine surviving the night of brutality turns into this twisted dark humorous and somewhat supernatural ride. The movie is simply astounding, the kills are gory and then the suspense, oh how it builds and how it makes you care so much about Samara Weaving's character.The whole day I had been feeling pretty down but after watching this, all I can think about is how good this film was. I think it's definitely up there with 'You're Next' in the 'surprisingly amazing horror' category.Samara Weaving has made me believe that she can do no wrong. Her comedy timing, her murdery rage as well as all her scared scenes are so natural. We should just go ahead and enlist her in the Scream Queens hall of fame (along with Jessica Rothe of Happy Death Day fame). The whole cast brilliantly supports the story by giving a taste of weirdness and quirkiness.Damn, this movie is good. I highly recommend it. It's so Fun. So brilliant in it's execution.8/10.

Looks like she might be 90lbs but somehow manages to overpower, literally everyone. Grown men, women twice her size. The only assault I wouldnt question what the little 10 year old savage she bludgeoned. The creators didn't have the stones to really follow through and of course theres the always iconic scenes where they could kill her.... very easily. But they dont and she somehow manages to escape once again. What rich white, family doesnt have hunting dogs... that would gave been a radical scene, to set them on her sent when she broke free... sometime I wonder if creators of movies like this, ever have that moment, like when you leave an argument and then think of all the savage things you could have said.

Besides that, I don't see any reason why Ready or Not would receive a rating below 5 at least.I was happy to see some nice gore and even when it went a tad bit overboard at the end, I'm not one to nitpick. I really love Grace. She's realistic and I believe that's how I would act if I were in her shoes. She's badass and adapts quickly in the deadly survival game. Honestly at the end when dawn came, I wondered what would happen if all of what the family hold to be tradition was false. Like they didn't die if they failed to kill the bride.

Spoke with the couple sitting near us afterwards and they liked it too. There are a few graphic shots but nothing felt gratuitous. It seemed real and you felt for the plight of the entire family.

Too much overuse of profanity to try and sound modern/hip/cool. How about actually writing with some intelligence and vocabulary (I know, I know, it's really hard to look up words in an online thesaurus).This movie had a great mood/feeling throughout, but it lacked in some areas that would really make it better:1. The whole, everybody gets CGI zapped at the end was entirely too convenient (and not scary by the way - how about some disturbing practical effects? Which 99% of modern horror lacks - which is why they suck by the way).2. It would have been much more fun if the bride went on a vengeance rampage (à la You're Next). Instead, she basically, avoided everybody until dawn - meh.3. Also, the lore was a very interesting start, but they didn't dive in nearly enough, and it could have been so much cooler had they gone into the history & ""why"" of it more. Again the ending was too convenient and ""wrap-up for time's sake."" It would have been much better if they actually had the spirit show up (i.e. more than a stupid shadow in a chair) and actually wreak some havoc.4. I get that a lot of the movie was meant to be funny (and it honestly was in some parts), but unfortunately, it would have been better to just use it as comic relief, rather than stretching too thin on both parts (i.e. horror and comedy) and creating a basically watered down horror movie with no real tension.",Ready or Not

673,SagentFives,Fives short review,7,6 September 2019,"Ready or Not tells a story about playing ""Hide and Seek"" with the family in a brutal way! It all starts with Grace's wedding with Alex Le Domas. After the wedding, traditionally a randomly chosen game must be played. Grace gets ""Hide and Seek"", the hunt begins and she fights for her survival. So first of all, the plot is well staged with the game as the main theme of the movie. The main protagonist does act really smart with interesting decisions and has a good character development. The other family members, except of one, on the other hand don't even have any or just a litlle development. Especialy there is one character process where I thought: ""WHY? Did I just miss something?"" As the trailer promises there are brutal and bloody scenes that the movie shows. So you will definitely see pain and death scenes, but this also includes deaths of unnecessary characters. The movie also switches from serious moments to funny moments really quick, so you can clearly see it's a Horror movie with comedy elements. But all in all I can say these comedy scenes are fine and you can laugh a bit, so I liked them! The cast is in my opinion also good in particular my two favourites are Samara Weaving as Grace and Adam Brody as Daniel Le Domas. One think I hate on that movie is the camera, it shakes too much. Even if this camera setting is by purpose for the atmosphere, it clearly doesn't work.
In the end I TOTTALY RECOMMEND this movie everyone who likes to be entertained. If you don't care about the few weak points like the characters or the camera and you can enjoy a simple story with a smart protagonist and bloody scenes, than it is the right movie for you.
BUT I DO NOT RECOMMEND this movie if you want to see really good unique plots with well written characters. Also if you dont like unnecessary brutal scenes, than you should not watch this movie.Have a nice day!",Ready or Not

Samara Weaving, who plays the main character Grace, is doing very well in the movie. She perfectly delivers what the character has done and has greatly improved since last film i saw her in the Netflix's ""The Babysitter"".
Despite having a good idea, the movie lacks a lot of crucial factors. The humor presented in the movie is very weak and out of tune, driving the viewer away from the movie several times and the secondary characters are all one-dimensional and those the movie tries to plant some subplot does not end.

I've read comments like ""this made me write my first review"" before, but i just had to do it, man, this movie was a HELL OF A RIDE - edge of the seat moments, thrilling atmosphere and a good storyline!

691,tylerchesserswim,"If you like horror / slasher, then definitely a great movie",9,7 December 2019,"Positive:
At first, there's definitely similarities between this movie and ""You're Next"" when it comes to general plot. An entire family ends up getting hunted down and killed by a lead female role. However, this movie was pretty spot on with originality and an interesting plot. Acting wasn't half bad for a horror movie. Could definitely connect with the characters in certain emotions they went through. The plot fairly original with really good suspense throughout the whole movie. Visual effects were well done. Definitely qualifies as a horror / slasher / suspenseful movie with some comedy thrown in here and there. And I love the fact that this is a standard normal family in the sense that none of them have any fighting experience. So there's no ""badass"" character that just runs around being John Wick and magically kills everyone. Nah. The lead role (Grace) holds her own and definitely plays a badass in the things she has to do. But not in an ""unrealistic"" type of way. She fights like hell and holds her own. Overall, great movie.Negative:
The only places where I would dock points are the ending is the same as any horror film. A lot of ""hunting"" and killing throughout the movie to end with = everybody dies. Same ending as every horror movie. Which, I do get is part of the genre and what is expected. However, I think I more twist ending would be:
Have Alex turn on Grace, hold her to the table all the way up to the point where Alex picks up the knife, about to sacrifice her, says ""Hail Satan"" ... and then stab and kill Grace. Boom. Everyone expects the typical ""everybody dies ending"". Instead, mix it up. Give me ""The Strangers"" movie type ending: the bad guys win in the end. Sure, it wouldn't be the happy ending most people look for but its a HORROR movie. Its not suppose to end happily ever after.Despite this, I still give it 9/10 and definitely recommend it as a descent horror/scary/suspenseful move.",Ready or Not

And the important point is the new horror is showing us what happens to our believes when a mother or a father, which in the past were assumed to be the shelter when we're afraid, become the monster themselves.

715,echaczyk,Oh this should have been better.,3,23 December 2019,"I was truly disappointed while watching the movie. I liked the premise and wanted to like it, but from the beginning I was put off by the cartoony cast and the lack of atmosphere. There was no mystery, no suspense, no horror, no comedy. The cast was one-dimensional, simple and predictable. The cast just didn't gel into an ensemble. And although killing was new to some of the new family members, the older ones didn't have that feeling of commitment.The story is about this rich family who made their money by making a deal with the devil. A century ago, the devil provided them with the cash and resources to build a gaming empire. The devil only asked for annual animal sacrifices and that anyone new entering the family choose, from a strange box, a game to play. Of the choices of chess, checkers and old maid and others, the worse game to play is hide and seek. Played once before, it either means the death of the person. Or, if the person makes it to morning, the death of the family.A newly married woman, (Samara Weaving) who in order to enter the family, has to play a game. And wouldn't you know it, she chooses hide and seek to play. The hunt starts immediately with the bride unaware of the danger of death. For some reason, the family has to use antique weapons in their hunt. After a couple people try to kill her with cross bows and antique guns, she figures that the family wants her dead and runs. The rest of the movie is her running and hiding and being pursued and bleeding and trying to make it until the morning.You might think, ""wow, what a great premise"".

744,thesimplecritic,A Self-aware comedy thriller,6,29 September 2019,"This film knows exactly what it is, and what I mean by that is, it's not trying to be anything it's not, will it win any major awards? No. Is it trying to? Also no. But, does the film achieve what it sets out to? Yes.This movie directed by Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillet follows the events following a wedding and during the indoctrination of the bride into a rather strange eccentric family, these events culminate in a murderous game of hide and seek. The story and plot are all set out in front of the viewer within the first 20 minutes, not making the audience assume or work anything out. This choice does make the film rather simple, but it is also contributing to the ease in which you can enjoy this film.There isn't much in the way of character development outside of the two or three main characters, it uses classic horror/comedy movie tropes to get by, but in a film as short as this, that has as many characters as this its easily sacrificed for the sake of the film's momentum. For the most part, the movie is shot pretty well there's nothing outstanding about the camera work, with some nice creative shots here and there, but there's also nothing bad about the film's direction. This movie is also far funnier than id thought it would be, finding humor in some very dark ways, but all its all in keeping with the films tone and certainly makes good use of the films R rating for some over the top blood and violence to get its laughs.All in all at 1hr and 30 minutes this film is a breeze and barely lets the viewer catch their breath as it throws you right into the story and its all the better for it, because the story and plot aren't amazing and its also rather predictable, but that's the style and tone the directors set out to create when making this film. It uses its R rating well to create some very over-top gory deaths which are all in keeping with the film. My advice for going to watch this film is don't try and place your expectations too high, and just let the film take you through the story, it's a perfectly fine film, that knows exactly what it's trying to be, and over the top action thriller with some dark comic relief.",Ready or Not

I'm sorry, but feels it's really cheap for a movie. I'm sorry, but it's my absolute personal opinion n feeling.

751,alfredvankuik,"Not worth the 1s, definitely not worth the 10s",5,2 November 2019,"I see a lot of 1s on here, but honestly this movie isn't that bad. What it is, is just a very mediocre dark comedy horror flick. One very important thing is that you do not take this movie seriously at any point. The concept is pretty original and fun, but it never really takes advantage of it. It just turns into a standard ""you're next"" type movie with a dark comedy overtone.The comic relief really is hit or miss. There were a couple of funny bits but also quite a few cringeworthy attempts. Samara Weaving does great as the main character and is a joy to behold when she turns into the sneaker-wearing murderous bride. The rest of the cast does a well enough job, never really standing out.It mostly is a case of missed opportunities though. The ending is very disappointing and really missed a chance for some proper revenge action. The entire concept of the hide and seek game could've been a lot more, but is in the end no more than an excuse for the characters to kill each other. The movie could've been a lot more fun, unique and original than it is now.The whole movie is certainly enjoyable as long as you do not take it seriously. Don't think about the plotholes. Ignore the sometimes downright moronic character decisions. Just grab some popcorn, turn your mind off and you will probably have a decent time. Wait for a streaming release and give it a shot if you're bored.",Ready or Not

I can say I was surprised when I found myself cracking up and glued to the screen. The acting was great, the jokes were aplenty, and the overall theme interesting. Each character in the family was unique, from the evil eyed great-aunt to the coked up sister in law. My only real gripe with the movie was the story of the origins of the game seemed to be glossed over.It is explained, but not in the way that was satisfactory to me. In fact, if not for the fatal twist at the end it would have been a high five rating to a six. The ending is absolutely fantastic, however, and leaves you satisfied. Survival is the game and this movie survives. Pure hilarity, decent storytelling make this movie one of the surprises of the summer for me!",Ready or Not

When Grace decides to marry into one of the wealthiest families in the world, she gets a little more than she bargained for. The family made its money in games and for one night only she gets to draw a card at random revealing, of course, the only bad game in the deck, Hide and Seek.It does take a while to get the full picture of what's all going on, despite a brief prologue that basically tells you what's what at the beginning. But as you go along you become as skeptic as some of the featured players in the film. The twists and turns along the way sure make for an entertaining ride.I'll be honest that most of the concept is nothing new, but the history, setting, and climax make the journey worth the trip. I give the main actress Samara Weaving top props for very difficult 'pain acting' as I call it, and deem her a true scream queen.",Ready or Not

770,dannymacquade,I had a great time with this film.,8,4 October 2019,"Ready or Not was a blast in the cinema. This is a prime example of how much fun a film can be when it knows exactly what it is. Ready or Not does contain some social commentary, but it doesn't get bogged down in it. This is a tight script. Now don't go into this film expecting straight up horror. I found this film surprisingly funny, and those who don't like their horror and comedy to mix, may want to give this film a miss. I found the cast of characters all very likeable, and even though it's set in one location, the variety on show here is great.The film centres on Grace, marrying into the extremely rich and eccentric ""La Domas"" family. She's an outsider and looked down upon as a ""Golddigger"", so she is eager to prove herself to her new family. So when a weird family tradition rears it's head at midnight on her wedding night, she goes along with it not knowing what awaits her. I found Grace to be a fantastic lead. Her performance conveying at first naivety and innocence, and then when required shock, anger and resilience. I believed her struggle and found it highly cathartic when she got her own back at certain points in the film. Also Grace should go down as an iconic female in horror, her get up consisting of a tattered wedding dress, shotgun with holster and converse. I hope to see people dressed as her come Halloween.This film was just so refreshing to see. It's completely original, not based on anything and not part of a pre-existing universe. Like Crawl, it had a story to tell and just asks that you go along with it for an hour and half. For some its plot may come across as silly, but the films knows this and offers up some brilliantly dark comedy. It's 94 minutes, and those minutes fly by whether your Ready or Not.",Ready or Not

At every turn the characters could have made an acceptable choice to get them out of the situations but instead they almost always had to explain why the logical choice couldn't be possible. Each argument was never convincing. After the third random kill of the servants I left. Wasn't funny nor scary. Sucked. Not a break out role for the Margot Robbie wannabe either.,Ready or Not

It was just solid.The movie was entertaining, with lots of good comedic moments as well as times of great suspence.For me the big problem is that it's almost as if the movie shows its hand very early. Entire plot is given away in the trailer and so the entire set up of the film seems like lobour till you get to the good stuff.The ""good stuff"" is about and hour and a bit, of running and hiding...

However the ending ruined the whole movie for me.The message that I got until the last 5 minutes is that supertitions are bad and can disorient the people. Also, when you cling to the tradition and keep not only the good, but also the bad stuff from it you gain nothing.But then the film cancels itself by proving the supertitions ""bad"" guys right that they wanted to sacrifice someone for an old cult! And it wasn't some major plot twist or anything close to that. The only reason that the creators did it that I can think of is to make the movie more appealing to the masses. It really is a shame because with some alternate last five minutes this movie would be way better and definitely more clever.",Ready or Not

The only other movie I can think of like this is The Cabin In The Woods. The only reason I did not give this a 10/10 is because some characters make extremely stupid decisions like the maid in the dumbwaiter who presses the button and closes it on her neck.

851,Aaronckemp,Actually fun?,8,3 September 2019,"Spoiler Free: I avoided anything to do with this movie based on what I had heard. hide and seek with weird family. Felt weird and one of those dumb 'Truth or Dare' type movies. But it's so much more. It felt more akin to You're Next, one of my favorite horror movies of the past decade. Samara Weaving and Adam Brody are great. All the other actors feel believable but also are sorta cartoonish? There's as believable as you can imagine someone could be in that situation. Good camera work. And for a movie set mostly at night, it is never too dark.Spoilers- the little Satan twist was neat, although personally I would've liked a little more ambiguity in it. It was fun, but the whole exploding and then seeing the dude in the flame just felt like a bit much all at once, but that's more my preference to leaving it more open-ended as opposed to a critique. Samara Weaving is just fantastic. Really sells the emotion of someone stuck in this situation. I think maybe she's a bit too quipy and I would've preferred if the comedy came mostly from the family, but still great emotions on display. Adam Brody is great. Steals every scene he's in honestly. He's either hilarious or giving such a good performance. At first I was upset he died like that, but it was better than having to see the one sympathetic person in the family die like that. I think it was fairly obvious that Alex was gonna flip on Grace eventually. It was either that or die. I'm glad it was after his mother had died and not like 'ooh i tricked you, I'm gonna kill you because I'm evil.' The mom is fine, nothing great but nothing bad either. It was great seeing the Dad become more and more unraveled as the night progressed. The sister and her husband feel the most outlandish but it works more than it fails. Aunt was creepy but I wish we spent more time on the backstory of her. I felt like maybe 5 more minutes or so to establish more of her backstory could've added a lot more depth to the character. Butler and maids are there to add to the kills. And they do not shy away from the kills. Blood and gore galore. But it's mostly played for laughs? There's really only like one or two scenes that are like hard to watch. It's fun throughout, mostly because of the acting. It's more of a horror comedy(?) but like horror/thriller first, comedy second. Think more Scream or You're Next as oppose to like Seed of Chucky or Scary Movie. Watch it. Support original films.

The most unlikely ""accidental"" deaths, the fastest boiling kettle, and Adam Brody.This isn't bad overall if you know going in it's an average at best movie. Based on reviews I had much higher expectations and that kind of ruined it.It's got some funny lines and pretty good cinematography. The storyline is of course outrageous but it's a fun idea for the genre. Very thankful that upon discovering what ""the game"" really entails Grace just accepts it instead of going through the typical 30 minutes of shocked disbelief. The things I didn't like were how Grace all of a sudden decided screaming at the top of her lungs was a good idea while the entire family is trying to hunt her down and kill her? Otherwise she's a pretty smart character and Samara Weaving does a great job.

876,mixymaxy,Would give Infinity Stars. My Favourite Movie of All Time now.,10,17 December 2020,"I'm a big horror fan and my preferences are a little different from others. I like movies with sick and sinister games, movies with a variety of characters to choose from, movies that dont lose 'horror' while adding 'comedy', movies with a cheerworthy protagonist, or movies that are good till the end. Any of these traits make me like a movie. Thats the reason I hate movies like Hereditary.
Ready or Not, however, was an unexpected bomblast. At the time of its release, I felt like its a boring old fashioned horror (I'm a modern horror fan), so I didn't even research about it. An year later, when I was in quarantine, I found Ready or Not's sypnosis quite attracting. Finally, I decided to watch it and it is my favourite movie now. I would give it infinity stars if possible.
Ready or Not offers a range of characters from the funny, dumb Emilie to the Caring yet deadly Becky. Needless to say, Samara Weaving stole the show by a far margin. Her performance was uncomparable. Probably one of the best movie performances ever. After that, the rest of the crew was no less either. The problem I get with most movies that offer a varying personalities is that as characters die, the movie gets boring. But Ready or Not gives us a roller coaster ride with a satisfying ending, which makes me smile everytime I watch it.
The Hide and Seek Song is a very effective song as well.
Moreover, Ready or Not has a perfect dose of comedy and its protagonist is not stupid. Samara Weaving has always killed the roles she played no matter if it was The Babysitter's Bee or Bill or Ted Face the Music's Theodora.
The movie is worthy of a watch.
I recommend it 100%. I hope we get a sequel.",Ready or Not

I thought it was an entertaining film and the dark humor mixed with gore was satisfying. Graces character was well written and tough instead of whiny and actually lived through it all which was a surprise since so many films of late seem to be the 'everyone dies, watch the world burn' kind of plot. Yes, some parts were silly and the way it ended was unexpected to me but I like dark, obnoxious humor and I guess some people just dont. I honestly don't think any movie put out these days is worth what you have to pay at the theatre to see it, but I didn't leave this one complaining about how I was ten dollars poorer and wasted another two hours of my life so that's a start. Overall, I thought it was a good movie. In this age of incredibly short attention spans, I think some people just didn't actually watch enough of it to warrant giving it a review. If you knew you wouldn't like it after just watching the trailer, why would you pay to go see it at all?",Ready or Not

886,hotrodd-72761,Good idea executed terribly.,1,28 August 2019,A rather interesting idea for a movie was ruined in how the movie came together. Swear-words are thrown out every second (often two or three words per sentence) as very crude poor attempts at jokes. Very unnecessary and bring the movie down as a whole. In a dark comedy hide-and-seek movie where to win is to survive through the night you're obviously supposed to root for the protagonist Grace. But the actoress and the writing for Ready Or Not make it so that the protagonist is very unlikeable. Makes the movie hard to watch overall. If it wasnt for the unlikeable protagonist/actress and the (very unnecessary) consisstant swearing throughout the movie. Ready or Not (2019) would be a 5/10 movie.,Ready or Not

With tons of gore and blood this movie deserves its R rating. Multiple funny scenes with more humor than scares is what this movie is best at. Seeing these adults try to use old machinery to kill someone is hilarious. I will say you can draw some many similarities from this to Jordan Peele's Get Out which is kind of cool to compare. Overall fun movie with plenty of horror I give props to the director as this was a great idea that was executed perfectly.,Ready or Not

And with the comedy aspects this was one of the better moviews I've seen in the recent years.If you are here for the horror thrills, search for another movie - if you like comedy, cool shots, a nice storyline and pretty cool characters you are dead right and should have a look at the movie.

She didn't come off as some 'already-badass' person that wasn't scared of being chased by killers...she came off as a genuinely terrified person that has to muster their full courage and sheer will-to-live to even get out of her dire situation. In that sense it felt more relatable. I also liked the whole premise that this ultra-rich family believes all of its wealth is due to some mysterious, magical figure that made a covenant with the family's patriarch, and that the family's wealth depends on following the enigmatic rules set out by this mysterious figure: each new family-member by marriage must choose one card from a magical deck of cards and play the game described on the card...only some of the games have deadly consequences. The icing on the cake for me and which really surprised me is that the ending was really satisfying because the 'magic is real' but still enigmatic and unknowable...... A beautiful mix of survival horror and Faustian wager (sell your soul for great power).",Ready or Not

If you expect to see a Oscar movie, then my god, why do you even watch this? Just because a movie its silly, IT doesnt mean you have to give it a 1/10 because you cant laugh. From my point of view, its not a bad movie at all, the acting wasnt the best, but again, what comedy had a good acting with characater development?

914,jdarnold-3,"Dark Violence, Dark Humor in a nearly perfect blend",8,5 June 2020,"In ""Ready or Not"", Samara Weaving plays a woman marrying into a very rich family. But that family has a very strange ritual when a new member joins the family. They have to pick a card and play a game. And one card in particular means a serious turn for the worst. And you know what card comes up, right?So this is one of my favorite genres - a thriller with lots of gory violence and plenty of humor, both just funny but mostly very very dark. Plenty of fun one liners and plenty of gory endings. Weaving does an amazing job of showing how this otherwise normal person rises to the occasion, despite being put through one of the most grueling wringers I think anyone has ever had to do, at least since Chris in *Get Out*! She has a great transformation and her expressive face conveys everything. I imagine it was probably a pretty grueling filming even.And the rest of the cast, led by Andie McDowell and Henry Czerny, were great and it was full of all kinds of actors that you go ""Now where I have seen that actor before?"" And a special shoutout to Brian Tyler for the amazing soundtrack. There were light touches when needed and some serious percussion when that was needed. Bravo all the way around!",Ready or Not

I do have to say in my opinion the star of the movie was Adam Brody, he played his character perfectly and just as you'd expect delivered some of the best/most sarcastic lines.

The protagonist Grace goes threw a huge development, which to all time of the movie stays reliable to the audience. Most of the other figures are shown concrete and comprehensible. Especially when it's about what they think of the family tradition. The search of the bride threw out the night has many up and downs for both sides. The hunt is really thrilling with its little shocking moments. Simultaneously it doesn't uses unliked jump scares. While watching the movie, it kinda allows the audience to choose on their own wether they're on the bride's side or not.

956,speermaryp,Not the Best but Not the Worst,5,6 April 2020,"The idea was definitely there when this movie was made. It was very interesting and all tied together in an odd way.
The biggest reason I didn't line this movie was that there was things that didn't make sense in the way that characters acted and certian things that happened in the movie that just weren't realistic. This isn't a spoiler but an example of something similar that happened in the movie that wasn't realistic. It's like if a character stops someone and then runs away as fast as they possibly can. Then they stop for a minute to catch their breath and all of a sudden the character they were trying to get away from is right behind them.
There was just small things like that which didn't make sense and wasn't realistic to what would have actually happened in that situation.
That's my biggest complaint with the movie but it wasn't horrible. I will praise it for having no sexual scenes (except one small thing, look at the Parent's Guide) and had good plot twists that kept me interested in the movie.
Another thing I would like to add is that they graphics weren't great either. They weren't bad by any means but could have been better.
So, if you're looking for a truly good horror movie that makes sense and has a good amount of scare to keep you on the edge of your seat but plays out realistically to keep you interested and to keep the spooky factor. I wouldn't recommend this movie. But if you're just looking for some scare and something fun to watch, this isn't a bad movie.",Ready or Not

No. Is it good? Not really. Is it entertaining? I thought so. While falling victim to a lot of troops in horror, it does manage to cleverly subvert a few. Some decent actors peppered throughout and Samara Weaving giving a pretty good performance. Most of the other actors are delightfully absurd and over the top, playing their characters ineptitude and idiocy to pretty funny levels. A lot of the comedy Falls flat but there are a couple of really Hidden Gem jokes in the movie that made me laugh out loud more than once. The ending is especially twisted and satisfying.

The very first trailer I saw for this movie was very comedic in nature, but the later trailers seemed to be more horror. I would say the film itself was much more Dark Comedy than True Horror, or even Slasher. So those that go in with that mentality are going to be disappointed.In fact, the movie is a lot of fun and doesn't take things so seriously.

I am surprised at all the scathing reviews for a film that clearly doesn't warrant it.What gives with all the haters?For what it is - a $6 million dollar, low budget horror/comedy - it is a refreshingly different summer time diversion. The high level of gore may not be everyone's cup of tea, but the comedy negates that factor.I also appreciated Ready Or Not's lean 96 minute running time. Too many big budget movies are bloated 2 hour and 40 minutes faux spectacles (listen up, Marvel!).

This is my first review but I have been using IMDB for years. Well I was wrong, The film had no real substance, it started out ok enough but once it got into the main plot it became predicatable and pretty silly. I get the whole premise of the rich being able to do what they want but the deaths and the way they came about just seemed very far fetched and ridiculous. The plot although had promise showed no real action of reality of what was really going on. It reminded me more of poor 80s style horror that was cheesy.

992,torijenks,Who wants to play a game?,10,17 January 2020,"Okay so, I expected to like this movie, but upon watching it, Ready or Not instantly shot into my top ten. I was drawn to it initially because it reminded me of The Most Dangerous Game. I absolutely adore everything about this film. The original song. The twists and turns that you don't see coming. And for the love of everything holy, someone needs to pay Samara Weaving to record every scream used in a horror movie from here on out. It sounds corny and somewhat entitled, but movies these days are so unoriginal and predictable that it's hardly worth going to a theater. Ready or Not was an absolute breath of fresh air with some real Shaun of the Dead vibes. Throughout the entire thing, I couldn't tell who was on which side, or who might show sympathy. It genuinely kept me guessing until the last nod.I can't really understand the low ratings. The trailers portrayed this film perfectly. Don't watch a movie that you're not drawn to, then leave a horrible review because you wasted your own time. Complaining about perfectly timed cursing in a rated R movie? Y'all are wild.ANYWAY...
Do yourself a favor and see Ready or Not if you are into horror comedy. Samara Weaving was incredible. The whole cast portrays every character so well. The jokes land. The gore hits. The twists keep going. I really don't think I could have asked for anything more to improve this film. It provides everything to make you fall in love.10/10 funny as hell

She's did the kill part but in the end of story. I love the story but not the ending. ( Especially upset with Alex ending part thts all)🤣

995,jaydbricks,Meh. it was alright.,7,6 January 2020,"I just finished watching the movie. (Spoilers) And I must say it was a decent horror movie. It's pretty formulaic in some ways but has moments that are genuinely scary/intense. With a premise that is unique, it keeps you on the edge of your seat for most of the run-time. Your always hoping the family won't kill her. The main character (Grace) does a good job of emoting and you start to like her and want her to survive. There was one scene in particular that had me very engaged and physically reacting. It's when she's climbing out of a hole and gets her hand stuck on a nail, you can actually feel her pain. The whole cast gives decent performances for the most part. Grace also seems to have a stiffy for cursing a lot which I found endearing.Now to get into what I didn't like about this movie. Firstly, I don't think it would be a classic horror movie; if there weren't some parts that just were kinda unbelievable. So, I'm not judging too harshly for some of these. For starters, the main character seems to just be oblivious to guns. When a girl shot and missed Grace by accidentally shooting another girl and the girl then drops the gun. Instead of running past and grabbing the gun, Grace just runs past her. You could say she was just too afraid to grab it that time. And then another time a boy drops a gun after shooting Grace in the hand and she doesn't even bother to pick it up. Lastly, after she strangles the butler guy in the field, Grace had another clear opportunity to pick up his gun and get in the car. But yet again she just gets in the car.I also didn't like how there is the moment when she initially met with her husband, and he was explaining to her everything that would soon to be happening that night. She starts screaming like a dummy.Then later on in the movie Grace finally makes it out of the house by crossing a fence. And as soon as the first car doesn't stop for her she immediately goes on this almost minute long, loud, curse fest rant about how that guy is an jerk for not stopping. When any normal sane person who wants to survive would have just shut up and kept running to try and put as much distance between themselves and the family.Another part that irritated me was the ceremony. Like the entire night everyone was shooting around blindly not concerned whether they killed her or not. Then once the husbands brother actually knocks Grace out and the father comes, the father doesn't immediately shoot her ensuring she would no longer escape. Instead, now there is this whole ceremony thing that they have to do, I guess that requires her to be alive. Dumb.Then there was a part early on in the movie where the father says something like ""She's killing all our people"" which didn't make any sense. Because the 2/3 people that were dead at that time were caused by the other girl who accidentally killed them. At that point Grace had only killed 1 person. Not taking huge points off here, but it kinda irked me.And the ending. I guess the writers did kind of a good job of subverting my expectations. I really believed that the husband was faking being part of the family again just to break his wife out. But the real ending feels almost un-earned. For him to immediately switch to his families side like that. Like his brother and mom just died and I get that should make him sad and maybe rethink some things. But to go from trying to save her the majority of the movie, to trying to murder her in the last act is kinda dumb. And you could say it was because of the one line of dialogue his mother had with him that prompted his change. But that would be also be dumb so don't say that.Another bad thing about this movie that irked me for a lot of it's run time, Is that they cuffed the husband around a cot dang bed post. Any man with average strength would have been able to break that thing with ease. But nope they just had him slowly chisel his way out with the handcuffs.I also almost wish they had made the movie a little longer just so they could add a little more interaction within the family. I feel like we didn't get to care about some of the deaths because we didn't spend much time getting to know them. I seriously don't remember anyone's names.Overall a solid C/C+ grade of a movie. Wouldn't watch again sober.. and maybe not even if I was blazed.",Ready or Not
996,jong_olihoot,Killer family hails to the devil,1,12 January 2020,The short background in this thriller seamed oddly incomplete.

I was so confused and kinda annoyed as she kept making them throughout the movie. Towards the end after she gets free she makes this animal noise like a growl which I thought was weird.

1009,neerhem-01088,Ending completely ruined it...,3,23 August 2020,"This concept of being hunted has always been intriguing to me for a film and this movie had so much potential. It started out fine. There was an interesting build up to the point where the main character, Grace, finds out the reality of the game. But from there she's literally just running around from one place to another and eventually it got a bit dull. Also this might just be me, but the gore made me uneasy and was just a gross. Gore is not horror and should have its own genre in my opinion.Many points were also predictable. Like it was obvious Daniel was going to be the good one and help her. And it was also expected that anyone she felt would be safe, like the maid or Georgie, would actually be against her. When I heard this was going to be a comedy horror, I was expecting to see some goofiness but the majority of the film was quite serious other than a few moments such as Emilie and Fitch being the comedic relief. With the rest of the movie mostly thrilling, I was expecting quite a substantial climax.Alex turning against her was a predictable twist as well, but the movie from that point on made the entire movie pointless. Like the family members just exploded. What type of ending is that?! If they were all supposed to die then it should have been in the same tone as the rest of the movie. And also, with the ending it means that the family really didn't have any choice anyway.There should have been some way for them to evade it. If they had just ended it with none of them dying and realizing it truly was just a myth, it would have made so much more sense. Or if Alex had ended up reverting back to protecting her instead at the final moment, then maybe that could have been his redemption and allowed him to stay alive by fighting against the tradition. Instead they all exploded, meaning they should have killed her to stay alive because they had no other option.I turned off the movie with a wtf did I just watch. If it had been as comedic as the final moment for the entire movie then it would have been fine. But the ending just didn't fit with the rest of the movie which completely ruined the entire thing for me.Only gave it three stars because the setting was quite appealing. And the main actress did a good job in her role but just didn't have a good script to work with.",Ready or Not

If it was a horror only movie it would be better, exploding like this in the end of the movie is just stupid, there wasn't any paranormal power or entity from the beginning, why would you add it in the end ?
Emily's character is just annoying, and her husband is just trying so hard to be funny but it's not working.

1033,k0ns,Nice late night watch,7,21 January 2020,"When both Horror and Comedy are included in the genre of a movie, you know what to expect: A gory comedy that doesn't take itself too seriously and that you can sit back and enjoy. ""Ready or Not"" follows that recipe, building on an original premise that sets a fitting atmosphere for the story to unfold.When it comes to the characters, they are mostly one-dimensional eccentric caricatures, but this actually works out well for the movie, which is based on the variety and not the profoundness of them. The acting is pretty good.I think the movie is also supposed to be a satire about rich people and their families, which certainly adds to the comedic element, but do not expect any profound social critique. This probably was not even the point.All in all, it's an enjoyable movie that sufficiently delivers according to its genre. It is not a masterpiece, but it's fun.",Ready or Not

It has some not-so-obvious twists that keeps you guessing, too. I mean this is no Citizen Kane plot-wise but it's well written. It has a message about wealth but it's not forced or on the nose. I absolutely loved the ending.I don't understand some of the low ratings but to each it's own. I read some people complaining this isn't much of a horror or slasher movie and... yeah, it isn't.

1043,Nicolai79,"Fun, dark comedy",6,8 December 2019,"Synopsis: A bride finds out on her wedding night that she is to play a deadly game of cat and mouse as an induction into her new family.This movie plays out like a modern day The Most Dangerous Game pitting an unwitting newlywed against the dark nature of her newly acquired in-laws. Grace, our protagonist, is drawn into a frightening game of hide-and-seek when she draws a sinister card only seen one other time in the last 3 decades. The cards themselves are a gift from the long dead patriarch of the La Domas family who has made a deal with the devil long ago in a bid to keep his family's wealth for generations to come.The premise is that each newly inducted member of the family must play a game on the night of their wedding, a tradition that stems from the fact that the family fortune was built on board games and the like. Most are innocuous: checkers, chess. But if you draw the hide and seek card it gets dark quick, pitting the recipient against the entirety of the family.This dark comedy plays out inside the grounds of the La Domas family home, full of secret passages, spacious interiors and deadly (if not completely inept) in-laws.The tone bounces around a lot making any real build up of tension impossible. The characters are a bit over-the-top, particularly the aunt who is almost comicbookish. The protagonist is really a bit unlikable so it's hard to get behind her as she scurries from room to room, with the dawning realization of her situation.There is not much backstory to ground the characters and next to nothing is told of the new bride making it difficult to empathize with her. The stand out in this film is definitely Adam Brody as the brother of the groom who delivers all of his lines with dripping sarcasm and detached nuance.The comedy is a solid 'meh' but that's not to say the movie has no redeeming qualities. For one, the title song which is played as the hunt begins is creepy asf. Horror fans, like myself, will enjoy the many creative kill scenes, as each family member wields some remarkable weapons from the family game room. A comically large axe. A crossbow whose operator, at one point, must watch a youtube video for instructional advice. A derringer with a hair trigger in the hands of hair brained coke head.There is a also message about the insular nature of the 1% and the lengths they will go to preserve their fortunes which is the catalyst for these inane behaviors.Worth a watch.",Ready or Not

1048,bradcrook52,I'm not sure what people were expecting...,8,2 October 2019,"I had to create an account just to write this review as I can't believe the amount of hate all these top reviews are giving the film. Potential spoilers ahead on the personality of the main protagonist.The film is a good fun take on the slasher genre, with a few different things about it to make it stand out from the rest. One particular thing I have to say is Samara Weaving as Grace has to be one of the most believable performances for a character in her situation. She is constantly in fear and unsure of what is going on and at no point does she accept the situation is normal. From the countless slasher and home invasion style films I've watched, this is something that is often missed. She isn't suddenly smart enough to get herself out of every situation, she is believably a grounded person in that circumstance.The film has a fair amount of gore in it and seems self-aware about how ridiculous the situation is so there are plenty of dark comedy moments which I appreciated. Yes, some of the characters are weak and some decisions/choices that are made in the final act aren't greatly explained or justified but overall I had a great time watching this film, doesn't overstay its welcome and moves at a brisk pace. 8/10",Ready or Not

But after watching the film, I was like what the hell. I should write a mini review. So this shouldn't be to long.First and for most for what the movie is, it's really good maybe even great! It has a bunch of dark humor some cheesy some really good. But almost meshes completely perfect with the film. Clearly it has the thrill of a thriller, and a part where I myself even had a minor jump. The movie, started strong and ended strong as well. The twist and turns, the laughs, all of it was great. The main actors and actresses were really good. Thought Finch was alright and the lady who played Adam Brodie's wife.

the plot is definitely entracing, it manages to keep the intrigue throught the whole film. you simply cannot get bored, it's very dinamic. one thing is revealed after another, and the ending is not disappointing as well.although the idea behind the plot may seem a bit far-fetched, it is executed brilliantly thanks to great acting (shout out to everyone and especially samara weaving) and the way the film is shot.there is a theme of following your family values and who is truly your family, which is great, but also not very overbearing, the film doesn't delve into philosophy too much.and finally, about ridiculous.
as it's a comedy horror, it is expected to have some fun moments, and there are many of them, actually. humor in the film is intertwined with the absurdity of what's going on. but some special effects were a bit questionable in the end, which made me laugh when i shouldn't have.maybe if it was advertised as a fantasy comedy horror, which what it essentially is, i would watch it much earlier.",Ready or Not

With that said, here I am today to share my take on this production in the form of bullets.Samara Weaving gave an Incredible on-screen perf. Yeah yeah yeah she's like a Margot Robbie doppelganger. But holy cow I don't think M.R. has anything on Samara in this role.Mark O'Brien: Hats off my guy! Within the first 15min Mark and Samara established very clearly that their characters were in a deep, true, and invested relationship. That's a duo i'd like to see again sometime!Additional Cast: Just an absolute fit. Wow. Each character had their own set of unique traits that ultimately contributed to the plot and/or tone of the scenes. Shouts out to ALL OF YOU wonderful job!Plot: Sure you can draw similiarities to other titles, yes. But this one was drafted in such a way that you're almost forced to admit the fact that ""yep, indeed, I have not seen something like this in a long while, possibly ever."" Way to go writing staff!Overall, this was a film i'll definitely revisit.

If you liked the trailer, maybe you will like this movie. The Rotten Tomatoes rating convinced me to see it, but sometimes statistics can be deceiving.)Samara Weaving plays a new bride marrying into an unusual family, who have board games on display in their hallways and taxidermied animals eating other taxidermied animals in their living room. However, she soon realizes that things are even darker than they seem, and she has to fight to survive her wedding night.Unfortunately, that's about as much as the plot is developed. The movie could have been a satire on family dynamics or class, or maybe it could have pushed the absurdist elements to the forefront (instead of leaving that for the ending, which was just weird enough that it almost worked), but instead the flimsy plot is treated as an excuse to run through shock-value violence in which every meaningless death (most of them women) is treated as a punchline. Someone in my row walked out shortly before the end; I should have walked out long before.Although the great cast gives it their all, they are given little to do other than scream and run.

Not overly original but seemingly a perfect mix of serious thriller/horror and accidental fightback comedy. It almost feels as though 2017s The Babysitter and 2009s The Last House on the Left were meshed together to create a steadily building suspense, all while keeping things somewhat light and real. A dark comedy in its truest form.Our protagonist does not come out unscathed mentally or physically by any means, as we see a Carrie-esc bride covered in blood and... human remains emerge from the once bright and carefree woman she was in the beginning. Undergoing changes at the same rate that her once beautiful wedding dress does.I very much enjoyed the acting which I felt was both deeply satisfying and unsettling as all actors appear to fit perfectly into their messed up roles. Some of the storytelling is a bit vague or lazy (a telling if you will); I found myself leaving with a couple more questions regarding histories of the family and other characters. However for what it is the audience gets the just of it.Alas the ending is not as surprising as promised - although I can't fault it there, it is tough to create something audiences haven't seen before at this stage in the game ;).All in all I enjoyed this film and did not feel led astray by the trailer or advertising - it very much is what it is selling.",Ready or Not

First thought in my head it wouldn't work because there alot of horror movie that are bad when it based on a game like truth or dare. Overall this movie works and its self aware. Grace our main character is a common horror character type but ends up as a strong lead. She run away from danger but starts to fight back knowing she got a 50/50 chance of leaving. The family of Andy steal the movie completely. Everyone brings something comedic to the film. Not all jokes land and a tiny bit of bad writing. Still I loved this movie. Its better then Crawl which is a normal B horror film. Loved it too, I seen every horror film this year except for midsummer. But if you love a fun horror film I highly recommend watching. If you have AMC A-LIST definitely watch it. Right now this is my favorite horror film of the year.",Ready or Not
1101,zelly-04726,Great movie if you know what you're watching.,9,3 September 2019,"Thought it was great. I see a lot of negative reviews from people talking about how it wasnt scary enough or it was poor writing. I'm just a normal guy who likes seeing a lot of movies when they come out. Some are good, some are bad, and a few are great. This one was definitely in my ""great"" category.From the trailer, you could easily realize that this movie wasnt a straight horror or thriller, for the people who are upset about that. And the movie itself recognizes what it is from early on: a fun, campy, comedy/thriller that tries to keep you entertained for 95 minutes (which it does). Of course there's some over-the-top deaths and gore, the movie is doing this intentionally, and I thought it worked great (especially the last 20 minutes or so).Personally, it reminded me a little bit of Cabin In The Woods, which is a great compliment because I loved that movie as well. If you want a movie with a few laughs, a few scares and tense moments, and a few good twists towards the end, go grab some tickets and see Ready or Not.And by the way, Samara Weaving did a GREAT job as the lead.",Ready or Not
1102,hillaryzahn,Great dark comedy,10,25 August 2019,"I loved it. The end.

1103,ammarramadanhilti,What a waste of time,1,18 September 2019,"I was so excited to watch this Movie and i traveled for it , one of the worst ever movie i have ever watched , the story seemed good and interesting but the actors and "" Comedy "" scenes where awful , disgusting , nearly after 25 minutes i wanted to leave and now i wished i did that .
i don't know how the rating is 7.2 , really confusing.",Ready or Not
1104,murray-90096,"Such promise, however...",2,6 October 2019,"It is an inventive enough concept, however ultimately it is a disjointed, lacklustre film that swings from slapstick, comedic horror to pits of gore more redolent of the likes of Ghost Ship.A one word appraisal: drivel.",Ready or Not
