0,bkoganbing,"""Attorney Client Privilege, This Is All Confidential""",8,18 March 2011,"Playing the title role in The Lincoln Lawyer is Matthew McConaughey so nicknamed because he conducts most of his business from his Lincoln Town Car which is chauffeured by Laurence Mason. As he has to travel to and from various courts, this makes it a whole easier. And the car and Mason thereby become a business expense. Roy Cohn would have been proud.McConaughey is no idealist, his services come at a price. But it turns out he has some scruples and they are put to the test when rich boy Ryan Phillippe and his mother Frances Fisher hire him to defend Ryan when he's arrested for rape. He was literally caught in the act as two neighbors broke in and held him for the cops for raping Marguerite Levieva. Due to the canons of the Bar Association ethics McConaughey finds himself in a jackpot similar to the one Al Pacino found himself when he played a young idealistic lawyer in And Justice For All. But the results are a whole lot different because McConaughey is not an idealist and he makes those canons work for him.The film looks like the pilot of a TV series, but I doubt we'll get any of the big name stars there if such a thing comes to pass. Marisa Tomei co-stars as McConaughey's ex-wife and a prosecutor to boot. Can't imagine what broke that marriage up. William H. Macy has a key role in this film as well as a private investigator who works for McConaughey and does very well in it.The Lincoln Lawyer is a very well done addition to the legal cinema with a cast that fills its roles out to a ""T"". I would really recommend renting the Al Pacino classic And Justice For All and see the very great similarities and key differences in both of these films.",The Lincoln Lawyer
1,SnoopyStyle,"Matthew overacts a little,",7,15 September 2013,"Mick Haller (Matthew McConaughey) is a sleazy defense lawyer who works out of his Lincoln limo. He's tough, he's cunning, and he'll represent anybody who pays. Louis Roulet (Ryan Phillippe) is a wealthy son of privilege who is accused of assaulting a prostitute. Haller gets hired to defend him. Louis claims that he is completely innocent, and she's simply a gold digger. Only the case starts looking like Louis actually did it and one of his crimes put Louis' old client in jail.This had great potential. Only Matthew McConaughey overplays his character. He does a lot of overacting. First he's completely on top of everything, seen everything, but then he is completely flustered by Louis' guilt. Ryan Phillippe is pretty good as the creepy guy. There are a lot of great actor at work here. And they all do a pretty good job.*** SPOILERS ********* Some of the ending don't seem right. Why would Mick risk everything simply to add that bit about the previous murder? And even if we accept it. There is no way the prosecution would charge someone for a murder they already have a conviction. Heck even if they KNOW the guy is innocent, they fight to the death to keep an innocent guy in jail. That didn't make sense.",The Lincoln Lawyer
2,Hitchcoc,Matthew Is Good in This One,8,22 May 2012,"I've always enjoyed sleazy lawyer movies. This one has an almost comic sense about it. As a lawyer to many lowlifes the central figure is able to balance his world through deal making. Of course, at first he is a money grubbing, anything goes personality, but finds out that there is more to life that this kind of existence. He is, of course, suave and controlled and usually gets his way. However, his office is in his car and his prospects of ever hitting it really big are quite limited. Still, there is a fine give and take between him and his client. There are some great twist and turns that spell a nice movie if you don't take it too seriously. It is remindful of those offbeat detective films of the forties where everyone gets in on the act and the conclusion is quite satisfying. Everyone eventually learns something and even the motorcycle gangs have a good time.",The Lincoln Lawyer
3,claudio_carvalho,Entertaining Thriller with Many Twists,8,26 July 2013,"Mick Haller (Matthew McConaughey) is sleazy but efficient defense lawyer that has scum clients. He has a daughter with the attorney Maggie McPherson (Marisa Tomei) and his car is a Lincoln driven by his loyal driver Earl (Laurence Mason). When the wealthy Louis Roulet (Ryan Phillippe) asks Haller to defend him in a case of raping and beating the prostitute Regina Campo (Margarita Levieva), Roulet claims that he is not guilty and the woman is trying to get money from him despite the evidences against him. Haller asks his investigator Frank Levin (William H. Macy) to check Rooulet's story. Soon Haller discovers that Roulet's case is connected to an old case of his. Further, Haller can not use his findings against Roulet due to the confidentiality. When Roulet threatens Haller's family, Haller is behind the eight ball. But he is a smart guy and has an ace in the hole.""The Lincoln Lawyer"" is an entertaining thriller with many plot points and a great cast. Matthew McConaughey is excellent in the role of a sleazy and smart defense lawyer that finds that has been used by a psychopath and who has a crisis of conscience for not believing in his client. The efficient Ryan Phillippe is also great in the role of a cynical psychopath and Marisa Tomei is sweet as usual. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""O Poder e a Lei"" (The Power and the Law"")",The Lincoln Lawyer
4,nogodnomasters,NTGUILTY,10,16 June 2019,"WARNING: CONTAINS MIDPOINT PLOT TWISTMatthew McConaughey plays Mike Haller, a smooth LA high priced lawyer who defends scumbags. He is proud of how he gets off criminals and uses unethical means to do so. However, he sobs like a baby when he finds out he put an innocent man in jail. The local DAs loathe him.A party girl is beat up and accuses a rich pretty boy (Ryan Phillippe), son of a real estate agent. He claims he was set up and there is evidence to indicate he was set up. However things are not quite right as the our lawyer finds out.

Rather than walk away from a big money case, Haller must try to figure out a way to get an innocent Hispanic man out of prison, while presenting a case to make the real killer walk. Marisa Tomei plays the ex-wife and a prosecutor in this film and finally has gotten a role where she keeps her clothes on. William H.

5,kosmasp,Guilty (pleasure) as charged,8,24 March 2012,"The movie is not really great by any means, but it is really good if you get into the whole thing. The tension that gets build up, the mystery that it does involve itself in works just fine. Matthew M. does a more than a decent job. The soundtrack is also really good if you like that kind of music.The movie also seems a bit like a throwback to simpler thriller times/territory. Which is not a bad thing. You can guess quite a few things that will happen and it still works. Unfortunately the movie did not get a theatrical release which it would have deserved (not to mention that it renamed into the German equivalent of ""Client""). If you do not have any prejudice against the lead actor then (or Ryan P. for that matter), I can recommend this movie to you",The Lincoln Lawyer
6,classicsoncall,"""You got one client in jail for what your other client did.""",8,28 August 2019,"Wow, I thought three hundred dollars an hour for a lawyer a little over a decade ago was quite a stretch, but Mick Haller (Matthew McConaughey) worked off of a hundred thousand dollar retainer at five hundred fifty bucks an hour! I always wondered how attorneys kept track of their time, I bet there's a good deal of rounding that goes on. But I digress.This was a pretty good crime and courtroom thriller, with McConaughey's character making all the right moves while working out of his Lincoln Town Car, hence the connection to the movie's title. He's a sleazy lawyer when it comes right down to it, but here he's representing an even sleazier client who beats up women and frames some poor schlep to take the fall for his actions. Haller figures all this out over the course of the story, and turns the tables on his defendant without skirting too many of the ethics of his profession. His opposing attorney Minton (Josh Lucas) comes to understand what it means to go down by a thousand razor cuts.I liked Marisa Tomei in this as Mick's ex-wife and a prosecuting attorney who often comes up against his cases. Five years older than McConaughey, I thought she looked fantastic. On the other hand, I was shocked to see William H. Macy's shaggy appearance as Haller's private investigator. He looked like he went through an extra rinse cycle looking all disheveled and gnarly, but he got the job done for his boss. Too bad he didn't make it to the end of the picture.The film makers might have taken the resolution to the story just a little too far. You're glad to see the creepy Louis Roulet (Ryan Phillippe) get what's coming to him, but when his Mom (Frances Fisher) gets into the act to avenge her newly arrested son, it's a safe bet she didn't think things through well enough. Whereas, Haller's street smarts had him ready for anything, even if he had to replace his stolen antique firearm.",The Lincoln Lawyer
7,gavin6942,Solid Film,8,24 March 2014,"A defense attorney (Matthew McConaughey) has a crisis of conscience when he represents a wealthy client (Ryan Phillippe) who has a foolproof plan to beat the system.While William H. Macy is really the standout actor of this picture, the inevitable praise goes to McConaughey. While his next few films (""Mud"" and ""Dallas Buyers Club"") pushed him to the next level, this one clearly has him on the cusp. His character here may not be far outside of a safe range, but I am not sure if McConaughey ever had to carry a film as much as he does here.Roger Ebert gave the film three stars, saying, ""The plotting seems like half-realized stabs in various directions made familiar by other crime stories. But for what it is, The Lincoln Lawyer is workmanlike, engagingly acted and entertaining."" I would be slightly more praising, as I thought the plot twists and turns were very good. But three stars from Ebert is nothing to sneeze at.",The Lincoln Lawyer
8,jboothmillard,The Lincoln Lawyer,5,31 May 2014,"With the release of Dallas Buyers Club, which was a triumph for the leading actor who won the Oscar, it was only appropriate that some of more serious and non romantic comedy related films would be shown on television, I was looking forward to seeing this one. Basically Mickey Haller (Matthew McConaughey) is a moderately successful criminal defence attorney operating out of a Lincoln Town Car in the Los Angeles Country area, his chauffeur is Earl (Laurence Mason) who is working off his legal fees, and his most common cases are defending garden-variety criminals. Then he lands the case of his career, Beverly Hills playboy Louis Roulet (I Know What You Last Summer's Ryan Phillippe), the son of real estate mogul Mary Windsor (Titanic's Frances Fisher), is accused of brutally beating a prostitute, but the seemingly straightforward case becomes dangerous when Haller himself trying to survive. Roulet seems to be innocent of the crime and was seemingly just in the wrong place at the wrong time, the pictures and evidence of the case are analysed by Haller and his investigator Frank Levin (William H. Macy), notably injuries on the victim, they seem similar to a previous case involving jailed client Jesús Martínez (Crash's Michael Peña) who was accused of murder but always protested he was innocent. While preparing a case Haller spends time with his prosecutor ex-wife Maggie McPherson (My Cousin Vinny's Marisa Tomei), she does not appreciate that he does not try to put his guilty criminal clients all claiming innocence behind bars, he does question whether he should have tried harder with Martínez instead of making him avoid the death penalty by pleading guilty. Being shown Roulet's picture Martínez becomes agitated, and Haller suspects Roulet could be the real killer in his case, but he cannot reveal what he knows to the police due to attorney-client confidentiality rules, and then it gets worse when he is accused of killing Levin who is mysteriously murdered as he keeps a gun. Haller is still determined to go his best for his client, whether he is guilty of a murder or not, he cross examines the called witnesses and the beaten prostitute, and is successful discrediting the opposing prosecution, but when a false witness is called and threatens to falsify the entire case all the charges are dropped and Roulet is set free. Roulet's mother is delighted, but he is soon immediately arrested on murder charges, Haller knows people may come looking for him so he readies himself with a gun, and soon enough Roulet is released again due to lack of evidence, he plans to kill Haller's wife and child, but he finds out in time to protect them and have bikers scare him away. Going home however Haller finds out it is not Roulet who committed the murder, it is his mother Mary, she shoots him, but he is only wounded and kills her with his gun, after he is discharged from hospital he does find a parking ticket bought by Roulet on the day of the murder, so he too will face a court case for his involvement, Martínez would be released, and Haller drives off to find his next case. Also starring Josh Lucas as Ted Minton, John Leguizamo as Val Valenzuela, Bob Gunton as Cecil Dobbs, Breaking Bad's Bryan Cranston as Detective Lankford, Margarita Levieva as Reggie Campo and Michaela Conlin as Detective Sobel. McConaughey is a good choice as the handsome alcoholic defence attorney who knows more than he lets on but does not let it get in the way of his courtroom persona, his car with the registration plate NTGUILTY is a nice touch, and there is good support from Tomei and Macy. The problem for me was that there was a bit too much going on with two cases clashing together, the best scenes are definitely in the courtroom with all the cross examinations and questions, and one or two twists popped up, but the rest fell a tiny bit flat and wasn't as dramatic, otherwise it's not a bad crime drama. Worth watching!",The Lincoln Lawyer
9,blanche-2,good role for McConaughey,7,4 June 2013,"When Matthew McConaughey first burst on the scene in ""A Time to Kill,"" he intended to emulate Paul Newman - in fact, he asked his agent if he could meet him. Newman said to him, ""This is a time to take your work very seriously, and yourself not seriously."" Well, it seems that over the years, McConaughey tended to take neither very seriously, appearing in a series of chick flicks and taking his shirt off a lot. However, that doesn't mean he isn't a good actor -- he is, and he demonstrates it here as ""The Lincoln Lawyer,"" also starring Ryan Philippe, William H. Macy, John Luguizamo, Josh Lucas, Francis Fisher, and Marisa Tomei.McConaughey plays Mick Haller, a slick attorney used to defending and pleading down all nature of low-lifes. He's good at what he does, and when his sometime associate Val (Luguizamo) steers him toward a wealthy, high-profile client (Phillipe), he's happy to take the case. The young man, Louis Roulet is the son of a successful real estate woman, Mary Windsor (Frances Fisher). He's accused of the beating of a prostitute who somehow survived.Haller can't help but notice, as he's looking over the photos and evidence, that there is a similarity to another case he tried, which put his client, Jesus Martinez (Michael Pena) in prison for murder. Martinez has always sworn his innocence and only took a plea to get the death penalty off the table.Haller soon finds himself involved in another murder and realizes he's being used as a pawn in a deadly chess game.Really good story with fine performances by all involved. McConaughey is handsome, smooth, charming, and deadly determined as Haller - he does an excellent job. Josh Lucas plays the prosecutor, and it was great to see him, as I liked his show ""The Firm,"" which flopped on television.Hopefully McConaughey has decided to move on from ""Surfer, Dude"" and take Paul Newman's advice, now that he's 43 years old. His talent is well worth the effort.",The Lincoln Lawyer
10,edwagreen,***1/2,9,18 June 2016,"Great crime drama with an excellent Matthew McConaughey portraying a suave lawyer who works out of his car and demands great fees to get the desired results for the defendants.Marisa Tomei's role as his wife is greatly under-stated here. Her part needed to a lot more developed. William H. Macy appears as Matt's investigator, but he soon takes a bullet ending his role in the film.What made the film so good were the many twists and plenty of irony here. While defending a client, Matt discovers his guilt in another crime and the guy comes from a rich family with mother Frances Fisher providing plenty of surprises by film's end.Ethics is a great subject and plot in this very interesting film.",The Lincoln Lawyer
11,Doylenf,Solid courtroom thriller with excellent performance by Matthew McConaughey and a five-twist ending...,8,25 March 2011,"Agatha Christie would be proud of the five-twist ending to THE LINCOLN LAWYER. The film is clearly top-notch and street smart. It's the most efficient, solidly crafted courtroom thriller since PRIMAL FEAR and WITNESS FOR THE PROSECUTION. It has so many twists and turns that it's likely that Agatha Christie would be proud of it.It also reignites the career of Matthew McConaughey as an actor, not just a charismatic star. He manages to be smoothly appealing despite playing a corrupt lawyer who has no scruples in defending guilty clients as long as they provide the cash flow he demands. It's only after defending RYAN PHILLIPPE from a charge of murder and rape that he realizes he does have a few scruples left. And the plot twists provided by the screenwriter John Romano from the novel by Michael Connelly, are deftly handled for maximum shock effect. Brad Furman keeps the direction tight, forceful and swift-moving.The cast surrounding McConaughey has been selected with care and all of them offer realistic performances. Marisa Tomei is appealing as his ex-wife who knows his shortcomings but is still attracted to him, and William H. Macy delivers a solid performance as his investigator friend. Ryan Phillippe is excellent as the client whose surface appearance belies the fact that he's as street smart as his sleazy lawyer, and FRANCES FISHER is outstanding in a small but pivotal role as the young man's protective mother.Not since the days of PRIMAL FEAR and WITNESS FOR THE PROSECUTION has there been a more intelligent script than this one, designed to baffle and blindside the viewer in the course of unraveling some startling surprises.By all means, highly recommended for fans of this genre.",The Lincoln Lawyer
12,zardoz-13,Slick Mick,8,17 March 2012,"""The Lincoln Lawyer"" qualifies as one of Matthew McConaughey's best films. This time he plays a well-heeled attorney (with emphasis of the heel) who finds himself trapped between a rock and a hard place when he takes on the case of a woman beater. ""The Take"" director Brad Furman and ""Nights in Rodanthe"" scenarist John Romano have adapted Michael Connelly's novel and the surprises are sufficient to keep you from guessing some of the twists and turns when a smart lawyer Mick Haller (Matthew McConaughey of ""A Time to Kill"") accepts the case of a rich young man, Louis Roulet (Ryan Phillippe of ""Flags of Our Fathers""), is charged with severely beating up a prostitute. Meantime, Mick is haunted by a former defendant, Jesus Martinez (Michael Peña of ""Cowboys & Aliens""), who wound up pulling a fifteen year stretch in the pen over the death of a prostitute. Looking at the prosecutor's photos of the battered woman, Mick ransacks his personal evidence file and discovers that there might be a link between the Roulet case and the Martinez case. As it turns out, Mick's ex-wife Maggie McPherson (Marisa Tomei of ""My Cousin Vinny"")is a county prosecutor as well as the mother of their daughter. Not only after Mick takes the Roulet case, his investigator, Frank Levin (William Macy) is mysteriously killed and Mick realizes that he has gotten himself pretty deep. Initially, the police suspect Mick, but Mick thinks that he knows who really iced his investigator. Mick makes the prosecution look bad, but Roulet refuses to take deal because he wants Mick to get him off. McConaughey does a good job as the shady lawyer, while Phillippe makes a terrific killer. This is a good film with a neat ending from out of left field.",The Lincoln Lawyer
13,grantss,Not bad,6,16 January 2021,"Not bad. Interesting plot, though a bit contrived and not hole-free. Solid direction - movie moves along at a decent pace and is never dull.Decent performance from Matthew McConaughey, which, at the time, was surprising. Before this the only good performance of his was in A Time to Kill. Since then, obviously, he has shown himself to be a great actor.Solid support from and all-star cast: Marisa Tomei, Ryan Phillippe, William H Macy, Laurence Mason, Josh Lucas, Bryan Cranston and John Leguizamo.",The Lincoln Lawyer

McConaughey makes a fine comeback in this tailor-made role mixing his charm and smarts equally as Mick Haller, a crafty defense attorney – who negotiates from his Lincoln Continental (hence the title from Michael Connelly's best seller), who may have met his match in his newest client Phillippe, a bad boy rich kid accused of a brutal rape – with several twists and turns en route. Crackerjack B-movie with an A-list supporting cast and a pretzel twisty, humor laced adaptation by John Romano gets shrewd direction from Brad Furman in a strong debut. **SPOILER** A stand-out scene is the pressure cooker courtroom showdown where a convict 'witness' (Whigham, hysterically low-key and steals the movie; charge him with grand larceny!) give a side-splitting testimony.

15,neil-476,Good legal thriller,8,1 April 2011,"Matthew McConaughey is back where he was at the start of his career, playing lawyers. This is quite a good move on his part because, after a number of movies which have been misfires, his brand of cocky brashness gives him the opportunity to do rather more than usual with a brash, cocky lawyer (called the Lincoln lawyer because of his propensity for doing business from the rear of a chauffeur-driven Lincoln) whose cockiness is brought low by the ramifications of a case he takes on defending a poor little rich kid (Ryan Phillipe). Although there are overtones of the standard ""Did-he-or-didn't-he?""-type legal thriller, this movie delivers more, and kept me interested throughout as it moved in directions I didn't expect.I particularly enjoyed William H Macy's ageing surfer legwork assistant, and Marisa Tomei's policewoman ex-wife, but most of the cast do a good job: only Pillippe is a little one-note.There are some good moments towards the end, particularly what happens after McConaughey has been sitting on the porch: you'll know what I mean when it happens.This film was better than I expected it to be.",The Lincoln Lawyer

One day he is surprised to learn that an extremely wealthy woman by the name of ""Mary Windsor"" (Frances Fisher) has requested his services to defend her son ""Louis Ross Roulet"" (Ryan Phillippe) who is being charged with the murder of a local prostitute named ""Regina Campo"" (Margarita Levieva). Although the initial evidence seems rather strong, Micky thinks he can produce enough doubt to successfully exonerate his client. However, as he becomes more thoroughly involved with this case, he begins to realize that perhaps Louis isn't nearly as innocent as he claims-and things soon spiral out-of-control after that. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was a pretty good crime-drama which had good acting and several nice twists and turns along the way. I especially liked the performance of Matthew McConaughey who played his role to near perfection. That being said, I recommend this movie to those viewers who might be interested in a film of this sort and I have rated it accordingly. Above average.",The Lincoln Lawyer
17,ferguson-6,Ping Pong Tournament,6,19 March 2011,"Greetings again from the darkness. Major dilemma: I am a sucker for courtroom dramas vs. I am no fan of Matthew McConaughey. I decided to give it a shot, and given my low expectations, I found the movie to be quite entertaining - despite its numerous flaws. If you are a fan of the endless stream of John Grisham book-turned-movie, then I expect you will find this one to your taste.Based on the Michael Connelly series of novels built around Mick Haller, this one has the look and feel of part one. Haller is the Lincoln Lawyer, so named because of his propensity to handle much of his work from the backseat of a classic Lincoln Town Car. The choice of McConaughey as Haller seemed all together wrong given his annual appearance in some lame ass Rom-Com, where he spends most of each movie shirtless and smirking. Luckily for us, Mr. McConaughey manages to re-capture some of the acting skills he flashed in A Time to Kill, so many years ago.In addition to his close to the vest portrayal of Haller, the movie works because of an incredibly deep cast that includes Marisa Tomei as his ex-wife and frequent courtroom adversary (she is an ADA), Ryan Phillipe as the accused rich boy, William H Macy as the long-time and streetwise private investigator, Josh Lucas as the ADA in the main case, Bryan Cranston as the detective in charge, plus Michael Pena, Bob Gunton (warden from Shawshank), John Leguizamo, Frances Fisher, Laurence Mason (Earl the driver), Shea Willingham (Boardwalk Empire), Trace Adkins (country star as the leader of a biker gang) and Michael Pare (Eddie and Cruisers). Seriously, this cast allows every scene to have something worth watching.The two things that prevent the movie from being top notch are the beyond belief exaggerated moments (including about 3 too many endings) and the absolutely distracting camera work courtesy of director Brad Furman. In the hands of a more experienced director, many of the flaws could have been corrected.This is not presented as an ultra serious courtroom drama in the vein of 12 Angry Men or Judgment at Nuremberg. Rather it is a character driven story with a multitude of twists ... some of which work and some of which don't. I found it to be quite enjoyable despite the script issues and the hey-look-at-me direction.",The Lincoln Lawyer
18,anaconda-40658,It Wins Its Case.,9,21 May 2015,"The Lincoln Lawyer (2011): Dir: Brad Furman / Cast: Matthew McConaughey, Ryan Phillippe, Marisa Tomei, Josh Lucas, William H. Macy: Intelligent courtroom thriller about reputation. Matthew McConaughey plays a successful lawyer who is presented with a case involving the beating of a prostitute. His client comes from a wealthy upbringing but something doesn't feel right. Director Brad Furman makes everything uncertain, which adds to tension outside the courtroom dramatic elements. McConaughey makes the leap from his usual romantic comedy roles and pulls off a superb performance as a confident lawyer who suddenly finds the cards stacked against him. Ryan Phillippe is equally good as his client who is on trial for the assault. Phillippe claims that he was set up. Surveillance cameras at a nightclub indicate that he was indeed picked up by the victim. Both McConaughey and Phillippe are the film's best elements, both playing intelligent roles where wit plays a major factor in the downfall. Unfortunately supporting roles are merely standard issue. Marisa Tomei turns up as a woman whom McConaughey was once involved with and shares a daughter but the role is extremely limited. Josh Lucas plays the opposing lawyer in a mostly standard role yet he makes it believable. William H. Macy steals moments as an investigator who helps McConaughey with the case. The film is a well made courtroom thriller with much uncertainty. It also demonstrates that even the slickest and most intelligent of lawyers can meet their match but only the best can maintain head above water. Score: 9 ½ / 10",The Lincoln Lawyer

20,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: The Lincoln Lawyer,10,26 March 2011,"Matthew McConaughey's roles have usually been the action adventurer or the romantic comedy lead these days, but it has always been his breakout role in Joel Schumacher's A Time to Kill, based upon what would be my favourite amongst the John Grisham books, that still remained one of his best, until his second outing now in a role as a criminal defense lawyer in Michael Connelly's bestseller of the same name. I suppose McConaguhey can convincingly project the savvy and wily minds of what it takes to be a legal eagle, given that after all he had swapped law school for film school.As Mick Haller, McConaughey shows how slick his character can be in glib talking his way through his myriad of contacts and networks built up over the course of his career, from ex clients to current ones, from beat cops to opposing lawyers. At times you may suddenly think of it as being a bastardization of justice, since Law Abiding Citizen reminded one and all that it's all boiled down to what you can actually prove in the court of law. So we actually cheer Haller on as the unorthodox lawyer who gets the job done, guided by a moral compass not to put an innocent man behind bars. He operates out of the Lincoln sedan, which is where the title got its name from, though a scene in the trailer that affirmed his choice of office got left out.And as far as the trailer goes, it probably hinted at all the narrative sequence to come - with Ryan Phillippe's Louis Roulet, a rich playboy realtor who got accused of bashing up a prostitute, and for Haller to defend him only to find that his client is more than meets the eye and may not be the innocent man he incessantly proclaims to be, and ultimately finding room to threaten Haller and his family. Well, thankfully that only scratched the surface of the story, which with its rich characterization is one of the key reasons why this film should be watched, since it's not your typical Matlock episode.I may say I've seen a number of courtroom movies and it does take something extra to provide that boost to its story, and here's where Michael Connelly aces it, by constantly highlighting a sense of danger in Haller's way that strikes very close to friends and family, never fearful of getting things out of the equation. More interestingly he presents a moral and professional dilemma for Haller who finds himself stuck between a rock and a hard place, and has to utilize the full extent of his savvies to bail himself out of the situation, have justice served, lock the bad guys up and ultimately, making sure his family remains safe from the very real threats coming his way.While lacking very big name stars, this film is full of character actors that make The Lincoln Lawyer a compelling watch. There's Marisa Tomei as Haller's ex-wife and co-prosecutor, William H. Macy as the investigator for Haller's camp, spotting some great hippie hairdo unseen in his films before, John Leguizamo, Michael Pena and Josh Lucas who plays a relatively green prosecutor. But of course McConaughey and Ryan Phillippe (always bearing a sense of having something to hide) were great opposite each other, on the surface standing on the same side of the law, but beneath there's trouble brewing with a capital T as the client-attorney privilege boundaries get close to being violated on moral grounds.Michael Connelly is probably better known for his detective Harry Bosch series of books, but looking at how this turned out I'm secreting hoping the other films in the Mick Haller series get made as well. A great legal thriller on manipulation with a good twist at the end, perhaps the cinematography could have been improved somewhat if all shaky cam moments got converted and done the more conventional way of putting the camera on a tripod.",The Lincoln Lawyer

The plot is basically this Mick Haller(Matthew McConaughey) is a dirty lawyer, that will defend whoever it is guilty or not as long as he gets payed. It don't matter what the criminal has done, it don't matter if the money he gets payed is dirty or blood money as long as he gets payed he will do his job. Lawyers gets bashed on for many things including being liars and Mick Haller fits all the characteristics of why lawyers gets bashed on by people and gives lawyers a bad name. He is quick and slick in doing what he does best. The direction and set up for the most part is well crafted in this story. The mystery behind what really went down will keep most audiences attention, it got my attention most of the way through. Maybe because of the twists, it isn't some of the best twists I seen in movies but it pretty good. The dialogue is also sharp and intriguing, the direction of the movie isn't flawless and has a few things that pull this movie back from being great, but that is only a small complaint. Overall this movie is most definitely worth seeing, especially for audiences that enjoy watching mystery and twists shown in a realistic and and a well crafted manner.7.8/10",The Lincoln Lawyer
24,sddavis63,A Decent Courtroom Drama That Doesn't Seem To Know How To End,6,19 March 2017,"I hesitated for a long time before finally deciding to watch this movie. My hesitation, in all honesty, revolved around the fact that the movie's star is Matthew McConaughey. I admit that I've had very mixed reactions to McConaughey over the years. Among those reactions has never been to be extremely impressed. Generally, they've ranged from ""I can't believe he was cast in this role"" to ""he was OK."" I'll give him credit, though. In ""The Lincoln Lawyer,"" he's actually pretty good. He plays defence attorney Mick Haller. Mick basically runs his legal practice from the back seat of a Lincoln (thus, the title) and he makes a living off defending shady characters. He prefers that. As he says himself in the movie, his big fear is defending someone who's actually innocent, because he'd be too afraid of the consequences of losing. He ends up being hired by the family of a rich young man (Ryan Philippe) who's accused in the assault of a prostitute. In a strange twist, he comes to realize that his client is guilty, but that his client's guilt means that a former client who is now in prison for murder was actually innocent. Thus, his biggest fear raises its head. He was responsible for losing a case that sent an innocent man to prison. He finds himself torn between his responsibility as a defence attorney to give his client the best defence possible, and his desire to get his former client released. McConaughey did well with the part. He nailed the image of a slick and fast defence attorney who doesn't really care that much whether his clients are guilty or innocent - he just wants to make a buck. And yet, he's also a sympathetic character. This isn't developed too much, but he's also the father of a little girl who he obviously adores - and he's a good dad, who takes her to soccer games and generally looks out for her, even though he's no longer with her and her mom. It's a complex character with a lot of nuances, and McConaughey pulled it off.The story starts out a little bit slow, but becomes a decent little suspense drama once the truth comes out - which is about halfway through. Once that happens there's a lot of twists and turns as Haller tries to accomplish his duel purpose: get his client acquitted but also get his former client off the hook. The supporting cast - primarily Philippe, William H. Macy as Haller's investigator, and Marisa Tomei as his ex-wife - are decent enough, but they really are a supporting cast. This is McConaughey's movie.I did think that the movie went on a little bit too long. There were perhaps a few unnecessary twists and turns as we came to the last half hour or so. It was almost as if those who made the film couldn't quite figure out how to bring this to an end. It's based on a novel by Michael Connelly. How faithful it is to the novel I can't say. It wasn't a great movie, but I did find it enjoyable to watch. (6/10)",The Lincoln Lawyer
25,Hellmant,As a whole it's just as impressive as the sum of it's parts; it's very engaging and involving and full of twists and clever turns!,7,8 April 2011,"'THE LINCOLN LAWYER': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five) Matthew McConaughey stars in this litigation battle thriller in which he plays a lawyer who operates out of a Lincoln town car and gets his big court room break defending a rich brat accused of rape. It's based on a popular book of the same name and a recurring character named Mick Haller. The author of the book, Michael Connelly, has said that he ""could not be happier"" with the film and that McConaughey ""nails"" the lead role. The screenplay was written by John Romano and the film was directed by Brad Furman (a former assistant to Julia Roberts). The film has a very impressive supporting cast including Ryan Phillippe, Marisa Tomei, William H. Macy, Josh Lucas, John Leguizamo Michael Pena and Bryan Cranston. The film as a whole is just as impressive as the sum of it's parts. It's a very engaging and involving suspense thriller full of twists and clever turns.As the film opens Mick Haller has a bad reputation around LA for defending murderers and rapists. He makes a decent living doing so and currently has an old client driving him around town while he conducts business in his Lincoln town car. When he's hired to defend a high profile realtor's snobby son, Louis Roulet (Phillipe), in an attempted rape case he sees it as a big break. Roulet says his accuser saw him as an easy mark and is just trying to milk some money out of him. At first Haller believes him and is excited at the chance to defend an innocent man but things soon get complicated as he sees a connection to an earlier case. Nothing is of course as it originally appeared and Haller soon finds himself in over his head as well as in grave danger.The movie is very smartly written; full of witty dialogue and cool plot devices. The directing is impressive (and it's only the director's second feature) and the characters are all interesting and well thought out. Most impressive about the film is the performances though; Macy, Tomei and Cranston are all impressive as usual and so is Phillippe for a change. I've never been a fan of Phillipe but when he plays an ass you just want to see suffer he's perfect. Some people don't think much of McConaughey but I've always liked his work and here he really shines. The movie is nearly flawless at what it attempts to do. It's nothing new or original but it's definitely a well made and enjoyable court room thriller. If you're a fan of the genre you'll definitely want to check it out.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdMAdy47IrI",The Lincoln Lawyer
26,thesar-2,A Time to DriveAway,5,5 April 2011,"A lot of people (well, critics) were proclaiming Matthew McConaughey's ""triumphant"" return to the courtroom since 1996's A Time to Kill is The Lincoln Lawyer. Hardly; on many accounts.First: I really, REALLY loved A Time to Kill, but it was still a thoroughly fictional and Hollywoodized tale of the deep south, whereas The Lincoln Lawyer was a much more realistic tale of the legal system in modern L.A. Second: despite reading the very long John Grisham novel (twice) the movie wasn't all that predictable, whereas The Lincoln Lawyer was. Every step of the way. And third – BUT CERTAINLY NOT LEAST – the performances were hardly worthy of a mention in The Lincoln Lawyer whereas in A Time to Kill, they were brilliant.Okay, now that I debunked those nasty comparisons and hopefully helped you see this as two barely similar, but completely different courtroom tales, let's focus on this low-rent lawyer and how he defends the guilty to keep his car running in both this economy and with the rising gas prices.Mick Haller (McConaughey) works out of his car, a Lincoln to be precise – hence the film's (and from the adapted book) title, and he represents scum who are most likely and definitely guilty so he can continue his, uh, ""practice"" until one day he gets a tip that a high profile case might be seeking him out.Louis Roulet (Phillippe) is accused of sexually assaulting and almost killing a woman. He claims he's innocent and it's up to Mick who's juggling his ex-wife/fbuddy, a motorcycle gang and finances to defend the pretty boy.Seriouslyfrom the moment Louis enters the screen, you know how this will pan out or if he's guilty or not. The nice thing about this movie is: it doesn't matter. It's all about Mick both redeeming himself and how on Earth will he get out of this? I like movies that have characters backed into corners and whether right or wrong, they have to find a clever way out. Also, I LOVE courtroom dramas. Whether in film or book format.Unfortunately, this isn't a great movie, or perfect lawyer yarn, but it's entertaining and suspenseful enough for a viewing. Yeah, 'a' as in singular. This is mainly due to its length and its multiple endings – God, I hate more than 1-2-3 or FOUR sometimes finales.Quite frankly, I'd much rather watch the (surprisingly superior) comedy Liar, Liar where another lawyer has to get out of an impossible trial with a defendant who might be guilty. At least that entertained me, at a much quicker pace, less screen time and didn't take itself too seriously.Overall, it's not a bad viewingbut at home. On the Freezone on your DVR box from Cox Communications. Just don't expect this to be briefly mentioned at the next Oscars.",The Lincoln Lawyer

28,Lejink,Matt gloss,6,2 April 2012,"Terrible title for an okay movie. My dad's a fan of Michael Connelly's crime fiction so I was mildly intrigued to watch it and while it was very reminiscent of your average John Grisham, it was watchable with the requisite triple-twist tacked on at the end to keep you interested. Yes, it's quite stylised, as you'd expect from a film set amongst the glitterati of California, nothing and nobody seems real so that you feel you're watching the pilot of some new TV series, which I'd probably say would work quite well on the small screen. There's not much action but plenty of plot, typical of the adaptation of a source thriller novel like this.I just about got to grips with the extremely convoluted way in which McConnaughey's title character turns the tables on his client, accused murderer and woman-beater Ryan Phillipe. Indeed McConaughey's character is like a legal ""Shaft"" bending the law to his own ends. I felt that his straight acting was better than his more recent comedy turns.The support is solid, the direction slick to the point of glossy and there's the now customary soundtrack in the background mixing the old with the new, to no great effect or rhyme or reason.",The Lincoln Lawyer
29,ElMaruecan82,Embark for a captivating cinematic ride full of twists and turns ...,8,23 June 2011,"""The Lincoln Lawyer"" is an interesting combination of many elements that usually make courtroom dramas a particularly fascinating genre. It features the moral dilemma of a lawyer who knows his client is guilty, it's a psychological thriller surrounded by the necessary elements of mystery, it has a captivating succession of plot twists rewarding one hour of conventional action, it also features a charismatic and likable lead and great supporting actors, and overall, the film is just so damn entertaining  I must concede that the opening didn't make a great impression on me as it looked more like an ad for the Lincoln car with such overconfidence in style I though the whole film would be an exercise in coolness, a sentiment that the characterization of the hero, didn't reassure. Matthew McCaughney is so cocky and handsome as Mick Haller, the competent and no-nonsense lawyer that I knew I would have a hard time to feel empathetic toward him, especially when we indirectly get the idea that he's the 'golden boy' type of lawyer who cares less about the justice than getting the job done. Haller seems like a man of business more than principles, especially when you consider the profile of his clients, not totally irreproachable ... but let's just say that this is only a facade that the film will eventually contradict. Indeed, ""The Lincoln Lawyer"" is a straightforward thriller that knows its business. It doesn't take five minutes till we identify the case and fifteen minutes to know about the main characters.Mick Haller defends a young wealthy kid named Louis Roulet, who's accused of raping and beating a prostitute. For Roulet, it's only for the money, because he's an easy target and Ryan Philippe plays the character with such innocence and sweetness that we ought to believe him, well there's something kind of suspicious, he's almost too 'innocent' not to be really innocent, but we all know, it's not the kind of movie to embarrass itself with an open-and-shut case. And progressively, as we discover the cast of supporting characters, so full of familiar faces : from Bob Gunton, to William H. Macy, from Marisa Tomei to John Leguizamo, Haller's investigation leads us to the first revelation about Louis Roulet. And there, something interesting happens.Haller realizes that not only poor 'baby face' Roulet is guilty of the crime he's accused but also guilty of another crime that unjustly put one of his ex-client, Martinez, behind the bars, and what saved Martinez from the lethal injection is his pleading guilty in total awareness of his innocence. Why this is interesting? because it totally reverses the relationship between Haller and Roulet, with a slight advantage for the bad guy, and for the first time, Haller seems vulnerable. Vulnerable doesn't mean in a weak position either, but while confronted to the revelation, and the shock of his friend's death (Macy as his informer), Haller starts to bear a cinematic resemblance to another iconic lawyer, named Arthur Kirkland. To those who don't remember, he's the idealistic lawyer, played by Al Pacino, who had to defend a judge for a crime he had privately admitted.Haller's sensitivity and inner goodness is established, and it's no surprise that during the second act, we start to discover his human side beyond the confident facade. We develop a fondness for him as a man who has everything to be the sort of cocky womanizer we love to hate, as envious behind-the-screen guys, but who chose to drown his frustrations in the bitter lake of alcohol, putting himself in such a state, his ex-wife Maggie used to drive him back home, sometimes her home like when she finally succumbed to his charm and decided to have a good time with him. And after Haller the lawyer, the boozer, we get to know the father, a tender man with an authentic love for his daughter. This sounds cliché, but it's not overdone in the film, and all the relationships look and sound genuine and realistic, which helps to compensate some possible flaws cinematic purists might find in the plot.And then the final act opens, more energetic, thrilling and captivating ... it's just as if all the surprises and twists were waiting to explode in our faces, one by one, going crescendo until the ultimate climactic sequences where the lawyer, to solve his dilemma, uses his greatest talent to destroy his client : procedure. The best way to accuse him of the previous murder was to bring the jail companion to testify against him, and in one hell of a twist, Haller proved his Machiavellian talent : using a testimony to prove its invalidity during the trial and lead to a dismiss, but making sure it would be used by the police to arrest Roulet. Justice was done, and Haller revealed himself as a man of principles ... the movie could have ended up here, it would have been satisfying.But still, it's a thriller, the package would have been incomplete without a revenge against that rotten, dirty world, that uses money and influence as immunity. Roulet needed a lesson and it was quite refreshing to see him beaten by the bikers who work for one of Haller's client. The revelation about the mother wasn't totally unpredictable but at that moment, I was okay with any resolution. I had my share of thrills, laughs, enjoyment, and psychological involvement. The film delivered what I expected, and at the end, I had the certitude that I watched one of the best courtroom dramas in years ... of course, it doesn't invite for cinematic purism, but at least, it entertains without insulting the viewer's intelligence and overdoing the 'action' element, why ask for more? And why ""The Lincoln""? What significance to the plot? Nothing in particular, but it sure had Earl, the coolest chauffeur ever ...",The Lincoln Lawyer

The flick culminates in a sort of predictable but ultimately satisfying reversal and always keeps its characters in focus, but it does tend to get lost in the space between its genres and it isn't all that compelling in general.

32,bowmanblue,Better call Matt!,8,30 June 2014,"'The Lincoln Lawyer' seems to have slipped by a lot of people. Yes, Mathew McConaughey's star may have waned a little in the last few years, leaving no real big names involved in the production (and, fans of Breaking Bad may be disappointed at how little Bryan Cranston contributes!), but don't let lack of 'star power' put you off.It's quite a clever little piece. I'm tempted to call it a 'thriller,' yet there weren't that many (what you might call) 'thrills' in the story. As the title hints, it's about a lawyer, therefore expect much of the film to take place inside a courtroom. If courtroom dramas aren't really your sort of thing then you're probably best to avoid this all together.Mathew McConaughey plays a slick lawyer who thinks he's seen (and possibly represented) them all, until a wealthy client comes along with a 'fool proof' way of beating a pretty open and shut murder charge. If this didn't invoke a crisis of faith in our titular lawyer then he soon finds himself a little more intertwined with the whole proceeding than he would like, leaving his family and freedom at stake.Perhaps one option would have been to go on some sort of 'Kill Bill-style' murderous rampage of revenge and blast everyone who's trying to do him wrong into next week. However, Matt decides the only way out of this is to outthink his opponents, therefore, as I mentioned, there's little action and more plot twists and deceptions to follow.Like I said, if you're into clever courtroom dramas then you'll like this. If you're into high-octane thrill-rides then this isn't for you.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",The Lincoln Lawyer

I will not repeat it here in order not to spoil your pleasure of reading it. I will just say that despite Roger's elaboration I believe that this intelligent crime movie, maybe the most intelligent of the year (and no wonder as it is bringing to screen a novel by Michael Connelly) would have deserved a better and smartest name. Or maybe the title was intended to be one more riddle for the non-American viewers? Just kidding ...It takes some time to decide whether to love or to hate Mick Haller, the Matthew McConaughey. He is a lawyer, son of a lawyer, he drinks in tune with all Californian private eyes in films and crime novels, he keeps guilty people out of jail, and sometimes innocent people in jail to avoid harsher sentences. Slowly you realize that he is not only smart and knowledgeable about the labyrinths of the system, but that he also would do the right thing eventually and he will do it in a smart way. And then his ex-wife is played by Marisa Tomei and his investigator partner by William Macey, so with two such partners on screen how can't we end by liking him. (both Tomey and Macey are wonderful actors doing here two wonderful supporting roles.With a well written story which succeeds to be interesting and clear to the viewers all the time, with many characters on screen that go beyond the standard typology defined by their roles and find to themselves a reason to be in the movie at the right time 'The Lincoln Lawyer' stands one step ahead of the crowd as one of the best crime films of the season.

Most courtroom movies these days have very little to add so it's all been done before. That means if you make a courtroom film, then it has to be well-acted and done right. I'm glad to say that this film does mostly everything right.This film is about a hard-nosed, take-no-nonsense lawyer who operates out of his black Lincoln. When he decides to take on case which involves a snobby kid being accused of rape and murder, he realizes that this case could cost him his career....or his life.The Lincoln Lawyer was very well-acted.

He is really good at playing flawed good guys or bad guys. The supporting cast led by Ryan Phillippe and Marisa Tomei were nothing short of great. I liked how William H.Macy brought his own charm and quirkiness into this film.Overall, this film is a tense, gritty courtroom drama.

It won't keep you at the edge of your seat, but what Lincoln Lawyer lacks it mostly makes up for with Matthew McConaughey, who delivers a terrific performance as Mick Haller, his character has many different mood swings throughout the film, and he does all of these parts very well, there are also impressive performances from the likes of William H. Macy, Marisa Tomei and the great Bryan Cranston. It calls itself a thriller but I really wouldn't consider it that, it's a crime drama, referring to this film as a thrilling is making us expect a lot of very intense scenes and some twists and turns throughout, none of that is seen here, it's a very bland story. No scene comes unexpectedly or suddenly, there is always build up to it and you always know, in a way, what is going to happen next, it's very predictable, there is nothing about the story that stands out and makes it unique from any other crime film. It may be the most innocent film to be considered a thriller, but the Lincoln Lawyer is still an enjoyable film mostly because of a very dedicated performance from McConaughey, and I would recommend it as a good drama to watch if you ever see it on television or Netflix and have some time to kill.

40,The-Sarkologist,Just another courtroom drama.,6,22 October 2011,"To be honest I am not really a big fan of courtroom dramas, and this movie, while good, doesn't change my opinion of it. A lot of my friends ask me because I have a law degree do I like movies about lawyers. My answer pretty much no. While they can be entertaining, and the argument and debate in court riveting, in the end it is still a court room drama. That said, The Lincoln Lawyer is actually a decent movie with some very interesting twists as well as ethical dilemmas.Mick Haller is a very slick criminal lawyer who prides himself on his ability to get people off. Right from the beginning it is clear that he knows how to get things done, and how to shake people down for money. At the start he gets pulled over by a bunch of bikies upset that one of their own is still in gaol. He knows these guys are legit, and he knows that his client is guilty as charged, but it is his job to get them off, and if he can get them off on a technicality, then so be it.He has his ways of getting his clients, and his clients are those that have money on them. So when he hears that a rich kid is in gaol for assault, and there is a beach house on offer, he's down their in a flash. However, the catch is, the rich kid is guilty as charged.At first there is doubt, but it is clear that the kid is holding things back from his lawyer, such as the knife and the fact that the girl he beat up was a prostitute, however the story is the same. They set him up so that they could sue the kid after the trial for a nice payout. It is only when Mick's memories of an earlier case that his suspicions become clear. However, there is a problem, and that is he is this kid's lawyer, and even though the kid ends up admitting that he is guilty as charged, there is nothing Mick can do due to legal professional privilege. He is ethically forbidden from saying anything.There is a little problem with that concept though and that is a lawyer is not allowed to be complicit in any criminal undertakings. He cannot lie on behalf of a client, and in Mick's case the only thing that the lawyer can do is to return the client's money that is left in the trust account and resign from the case. However, I suspect that this wasn't an option for Mick as his client, as well as being wealthy, was also capable of doing anything.One theme that seems to run through the movie is how Mick's job is to get guilty people declared innocent and released back onto the street. Mind you most of this comes from the District Attourney, and their job is to keep the peace, and that includes keeping violent people locked up. However one of the foundation of the American justice system is for everybody who has been charged with an offense to have their say in a lawfully constituted court of law, and everybody to have access to the services of an experienced counsel. In one way it can be considered fairness, but in another it protects the individual against the might of government. Without these protections we could all be locked up on the whimsiest charges.Personally, I don't know how this movie will appeal to people who like courtroom dramas, and I have seen some myself, but while I say it is a good movie and I enjoyed the twists, it is still a courtroom drama.",The Lincoln Lawyer
41,Floated2,Refreshing courtroom drama,8,10 February 2017,"Starring Matthew McConaughey in this courtroom drama tells the story of a lawyer and his justice in protecting his name to help and serve his clients. In this film, he finds a perfect fit for his likable personality and screen charisma in a fictitious character created by Michael Connelly (Blood Work), a prolific best-selling author of legal thrillers. Michael ""Mickey"" Haller (McConaughey) conducts business in Los Angeles County from the back seat of a Lincoln Town Car driven by Earl (Laurence Mason), a former client working off his legal fees. This is a great role for McConaughey where he doesn't need to be over the top, and spewing out ridiculous one-liners, as he carries the film through beginning to end.Within the film, we see that Haller is a smooth operator who relies on his street smarts to make sure he always gets payment up front for the legal services rendered. He tries hard to avoid lengthy trials and prefers to cut slick plea bargain deals for the scum he represents. The Lincoln Lawyer does play out as if there was a potential series or franchise lined up, but since the film was not a box office success, we were only left with one film. This film is far more engaging and entertaining than one would have originally presented, as it keeps us the audience engaged in the story and wanting more of each step of the way. The supporting cast play their roles great, the dialogue is clever and the end result isn't as predictable as some of these other recent drama releases. The camera work does resemble that of a television series, which as been point out but as one continues watching the film unfold, it becomes less of a problem. As a rewatch 07.25.19' remains a great thrilling lawyer drama.",The Lincoln Lawyer
42,howard.schumann,A performance that is almost certain to produce some sequels,8,27 March 2011,"If you have trouble keeping track of all the characters in Brad Furman's courtroom drama, The Lincoln Lawyer, you probably have plenty of company. One character you cannot miss, however, is Mick Haller, the slick, charming defense attorney skillfully played by Matthew McConaughey in a performance that is almost certain to produce some sequels. Mick's office is the back seat of a Lincoln Continental, chauffeured by Laurence Mason, which saves money on rent and allows him to wheel and deal away from public scrutiny.Divorced from the very attractive Maggie McPherson (Marissa Tomei), another attorney, Mick knows his way around courtrooms and has connections with police, bail bondsmen, and even the Hell's Angels, who are portrayed as being so gentle they could be mistaken for a church social group if they didn't have bikes and facial hair. Mick pays them for favors rendered and they never seem to haggle over price. What a great bunch of guys, ready to beat someone up for a buck whenever Mick comes-a-calling. Though I wouldn't call Mick unscrupulous, he's not troubled by too many ethical concerns and defends all sorts of lowlifes including murderers, drug dealers, and prostitutes, if the price is right.In this case, however, his primary client is a wealthy socialite named Louis Roulet (Ryan Phillippe), usually seen with his mother (Frances Fisher). Because Roulet is so fit and proper, we tend to believe him when he insists that he is innocent of the crime of brutally beating a prostitute. Soon, however, Louis is caught in a lie and the case becomes complicated when evidence of Roulet's past begins to surface.Though Mick begins to have considerable doubt about his client's veracity, he is committed to defend him. His chief investigator is Frank Levin played by William H. Macy, looking very uncharacteristic with long hair and a moustache and Levin will play a key role in the unraveling of the case. Many different characters surface including Jesus Martinez (Michael Pena), a man serving time in prison for the murder of another prostitute and who Mick is beginning to think was wrongfully convicted, and Val Valenzuela, a sleazy bail bondsman played by John Leguizamo.Based on the best-selling novel by Michael Connelly and a screenplay by John Romano, The Lincoln Lawyer is an entertaining film that avoids gruesome over-the-top violence, chase scenes, and all the other accoutrements of what passes these days for entertainment, and Furman's sure hand keeps us on edge with many plot twists and turns. While, on the surface, The Lincoln Lawyer is a standard crime drama that telegraphs its punches, Mick's personality is so compelling that it takes the film to a different level and renders over-analysis meaningless. So grab some pop corn and enjoy one of those entertainments that are such great fun at the time but that we just might forget the next day.",The Lincoln Lawyer
43,TheMovieDiorama,"The Lincoln Lawyer points its finger and exclaims ""alright, objection!"" through dreadful direction.",5,1 May 2019,"Yet another frustrating experience. Given the acclaim this courtroom thriller has received, and a pivotal moment in what is informally known as the ""McConaissance"", one would've hoped for an engaging experience. Strangely, despite the captivating main case and McConaughey's rejuvenated performance (and that's coming from a person who dislikes his acting...), the direction was a distracting incoherence. Furman does his best to butcher Connelly's novel, and does so in technical anger-inducing amateurism. A high profile attorney is hired to prove a wealthy man's innocence from raping and assaulting a woman.The plot thickens as he furthers digs down in this investigative case, with many witnesses and suspects not entirely telling the truth. A courtroom drama fuelled by a thrilling story with plenty of twists and turns. The two may not necessarily translate well together, with the courtroom scenes bolstering a large amount of engagement in comparison to the plot details outside of the room, yet the overbearing case contained plenty of dialogue that fuelled fiery exchanges. McConaughey's titular role was revelatory, harnessing the visceral grit and harsh professionalism of a hot shot LA lawyer. You gradually start to cling onto every word he says and when he starts questioning witnesses, you'll be damned if you weren't glued to the screen. The way the narrative is structured, with the only suspect revealing a crucial detail halfway through, was somewhat predictable but that's when the traits of a thriller are introduced. It rapidly becomes personal and the stakes are always increasing through convoluted yet entertaining twists.However, all of this is for nothing when Furman is at the helm. He categorically savages this thriller through atrocious direction, distracting editing and his inability to end the film satisfactorily. The shoddy camera work, mostly consisting of excessive shakiness and constant zooms, resulted in the film losing its cinematic flair. Frequently it felt like watching an extended episode of 'Law and Order"", with those trashy flashback sequences that are tinted with a green filter and shaking like the operator was in the midst of a tepid earthquake. The amount of unnecessary zooms, which produce no tension whatsoever, clearly shows that Furman misuses the technique. Style? Gimme a break.The editing was haphazard, to the point that the narrative occasionally became disjointed. One scene will see a cold conversation regarding the case with an underused Cranston, only to then rapidly shift to an entirely different scene midway through. The personal aspects of McConaughey's character, most notably his child and rocky relationship with Tomei, were underdeveloped and were only used as a plot device for the last act when they are threatened. Again, acting as another distraction from the main case. Then we get to that well-deserved conclusion. Sentencing will be scheduled at a later date and everyone leaves the courtroom in a final twist, beautifully setup I must confess. Perfect ending. Oh no wait, Furman isn't done yet. Someone is released and threatens his family. But wait, there's more! Another twist happens (which makes no sense and is completely useless) and continues on for another ten minutes. I can safely say the film has a minimum of three endings, and only one works well.For me, The Lincoln Lawyer is an overrated amateur puff piece. A dire shame considering my adoration for courtroom dramas, but Furman himself needed to hire a lawyer to keep this film on track. It did change my mind on McConaughey though...slightly...",The Lincoln Lawyer

45,Movie_Muse_Reviews,Perfectly paced and gripping legal thriller,8,13 July 2011,"There are the grand emotional courtroom dramas that immerse you in the ethical dilemmas that stem from from the case itself, filled with quotable speeches from venerable actors; then there's ""The Lincoln Lawyer"" starring Matthew McConaughey. Based on the Michael Connelly novel, the film plays more like a crime thriller set in the legal realm, one that intends to be equal parts slick and ethically challenging. Rather than an honorable protagonist who must do the right thing in the face of great adversity to combat a corrupt justice system, Mick Haller is an alcoholic with a moral compass that would make your intestines curl.""The Lincoln Lawyer"" embraces the idea that the legal system is an open air-market where deals are cut left and right ""justice"" is nothing more than a word that keeps it from crumbling. Mick Haller puts bad guys on the street and makes a living off the legal fees of some of the scummier creatures in Los Angeles, but he's also seen his fair share of state prosecutors using big hammer on a tiny nail — that's just how it goes. However, there comes a time when every person's true moral character is tested.Haller finds himself in a tough spot when he agrees to defend a wealthy real estate agent name Louis Roulet (Ryan Philippe) who's been charged with assaulting and raping a prostitute. If he's telling the truth, the case seems pretty open-and-close, but he's hiding a few secrets that twist the case in unimaginable ways.Although terrific talent lines this film inside and out, the acting merely helps bolster the impressiveness of the gripping story. Director Brad Furman has paced the film perfectly with the exception of the last 15 minutes; there are essentially no dull moments. Solid legal thrillers can wrap around your brain with the slightest of ease (why else would ""Law & Order"" still be on television?), but the true challenge lies in telling a unique story. No rival comes to mind to Haller's ethical quandary.McConaughey's swagger makes him perfect for a sleazy lawyer, but the emotionally troubled alcoholic side of the character — the part that can't sleep at night — doesn't lie outside of his acting boundaries. Although neither the script nor the direction ever tests him for too long in this regard, he embodies the role to the point that it does add something to the film. In my experience, McConaughey's never been better.Actors such as William H. Macy, a still-underrated Ryan Phillippe, Marisa Tomei, Josh Lucas, John Leguizamo and Bryan Cranston all provide excellent fits and stud out the cast, but the stars remain the thrills of the story and Furman's superb pacing.The film's ethical dilemmas and insights provide for some relatively strong chewing, but but ""Lincoln Lawyer"" rides suspense and engaging dialogue like a Lincoln Town Car into the sunset.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com",The Lincoln Lawyer
46,jzappa,Most Charm is Interjected from the Corners,7,12 July 2011,"It's been awhile since Matthew McConaughey really seemed keen on being an actor in preference to a beefy shirtless smile for producers to drape a blonde actress on. With this mechanical legal drama, he still doesn't substantiate much significant concern with dramatic recreation. A few cocky furrows of that rigid brow and some wily, bourbon-battered line deliveries obey the role, as is normal. Though luckily, some of the people sharing the screen with him give The Lincoln Lawyer some needed integrity. With William H. Macy, John Leguizamo, Marisa Tomei, Bryan Cranston and Michael Pena interjecting from the tangents, the film is intermittently freed from its forced manner by cream-of-the-crop players with a knack for natural, unaffected and all the more compelling delivery. These roles aren't exceptionally big or unpredictable, but they make it refreshingly idiosyncratic. Each of these supporting actors brings a less predictable fluency that establishes a past between themselves and McConaughey without lots of exposition, though the script is mainly interested in its mechanical use of Tomei as his prosecutor ex-wife, of course, and P.I. buddy Macy, able to roll with most any punch beneath unkempt shag-top.McConaughey sports his routine self-assurance and charisma in a role that should fit him as well as the loud designer suits his unrealistic character fancies. Mick Haller is a social butterfly of a highly unlikely defense lawyer, flitting from one rendezvous to the next in his glossy, stylish eponymous town car out of which he operates, slipping people money with a smirk and having a cool black bodyguard while a comic book catalogue of offenders compete for his card like the ladies compete for McConaughey's number. He's that brashly calculating litigator who knows which hands to oil and how to neatly hemorrhage a client of money.Mick isn't supposed to always be a likable guy, nor a bad one either, indeed a much humbled one, ideally, and that's part of what gives the movie its needed sharpness. Actually, we tend more to like near-McConaughey lookalike Josh Lucas, playing the inexperienced prosecutor going after Phillippe. The plot whirls Mick into a case that at first looks like a bonus but becomes a possibly career-ending devastation. After twisting his slyest sleight of hand, Haller is solicited to represent a particularly prestigious client in the guise of a young, well-to-do Ryan Phillippe, indicted for beating and raping a prostitute. Haller sees a superb take-home packet and maybe even that most infrequent of luxuries: a genuinely innocent defendant.However, anyone paying attention will continuously look askance at the rich client, at the scene where Haller rides up on him while he's swatting golf balls on a course whose vast deluxe greens set alongside the azure Pacific might as well be a postcard reading ""I'm rich and you're not."" In a respectable twist, the crucial mystery of the plot is answered about midway through the movie and it then becomes about some witty legal manipulation by Mick. If you've seen Primal Fear and Jagged Edge, you understand the general effect of this route through the overcrowded but virtually surefire courtroom genre.This is a film that intermittently comes within reach of the stark, wicked, and darkly shrewd legal thriller that it wants to be, but never quite knows how to stay there. But hey, the desaturated sheen of the film and fly-on-the-wall hand-held camera-work make the bilious innards of LA fittingly tense. All of this coagulates in an adequate manner. It's not inspired, it's a long way from perfect, and the second emergence of the biker gang officially meets the criteria, I think, of a phenomenon. The formula of ostensibly superfluous and ancillary characters comes satisfactorily into play as proceedings from the present are discovered to be linked to the past. I did feel destabilized by the movie's ultimate surprise, which is totally capricious and uninformed. The intrigues seem like half-baked shots in several directions made household by other crime pictures. But for what it is, this certainly tense spellbinder is workmanlike, likeably acted and engaging.",The Lincoln Lawyer
47,Turfseer,"Not always believable but highly entertaining portrait of slick, shyster attorney",7,12 October 2012,"Based on the Michael Connelly novel, 'The Lincoln Lawyer' pulls you in right away with its intriguing title. Will it be about an attorney who's known for his honesty just like our legendary 16th President? Not quite. The Lincoln Lawyer is Mick Haller (Matthew McConaughey), a slick and somewhat sleazy barrister who conducts most of his business inside his aging Lincoln Continental town car. But in a sense, the parallels between Haller and 'Honest Abe' are not completely off base. Like President Lincoln, Haller has an incredible command of the law. And more importantly, he's cultivated the right connections which enables him to call in favors at crucial moments, guaranteeing his success.Haller is one of those characters that may be a little too cool to be believable. Nonetheless, film audiences will identify with Haller as a man who is never intimidated. Consider how he's not afraid to demand more money from his client, a member of a motorcycle gang who's now in trouble with the law. And when he meets up with the head of the gang to demand payment, he has no trouble asking for an additional $10,000. There's also humor to be found here, when Haller is granted a continuance from the Judge for his biker client, after advising the Court that he needs more time to question a new witness: a ""Mr. Green"" (Green of course being the additional funds owed to him by the biker gang).The film's neo-noir narrative, conveys a heady verisimilitude of the California criminal justice system. For example, when Haller meets with a former drug addict client who's now been re-arrested (again for drugs), he advises her that she's going to have to do some jail time (as she's already been through pre-trial rehab). When the addict agrees to give up a confederate, Haller gets her back in pre-trial rehab (an event which later figures prominently in the plot).We break into the second act when Haller is introduced by a bail bondsman to a new client, Louis Roulet, a young Blueblood from a rich, Beverly Hills family who turns out to be a psychopath and possible serial killer. Roulet (played menacingly well by Ryan Phillippe) has been charged with beating up a prostitute but claims he's been set up by her along with a sleazy associate. Haller soon establishes a link between a former client, Martinez, who was accused of murdering a prostitute, Donna Renteria, in the same way the current victim was assaulted (both had wounds on only one side of their face). When he visits Martinez at San Quentin and shows him a photograph of Roulet, Martinez won't even look at it, as he's bitter at Haller for not believing in his innocence at the time of trial and forcing him to accept a plea bargain which sent him up the river for at least fifteen years (I was not entirely convinced that Martinez wouldn't have entertained Haller's offer to at least listen to what he had to say, in an attempt to ""make things right"").Haller conscripts an investigator who he works with, Frank Levin (William H. Macy), a former police officer who looks like an aging hippie, to see if there's a connection between Roulet and the earlier victim. Haller is murdered after leaving a cryptic message on Haller's voice mail, indicating he was on to something. Roulet breaks into Haller's home and admits that he's guilty of murdering Renteria but invokes attorney-client privilege to keep Haller quiet. Roulet goes beyond the usual serial killer routine (murdering prostitutes), when he threatens to harm Haller's wife Maggie (played by an underutilized Marisa Tomei) and their daughter. While it may have been a stretch to believe that most serial killers such as Roulet would include his own attorney as one of his targets, the way in which Haller figures out how to undermine Roulet without losing the case, is quite ingenious.Haller calls in Favor #1 from his drug addict client who he got into pre-trial rehab. She fills jail house snitch Corliss in on the fact that Renteria had a sexy snake tattoo on her body that only the killer would have known. The assistant DA puts Corliss on the stand, but Haller discredits him by citing a case in which Corliss's testimony resulted in an innocent man being convicted. Roulet's case is dismissed but he's detained for questioning due to Corliss's testimony about Renteria's special tattoo.Haller enrages Roulet by implying that he was responsible for setting up Corliss's testimony. Once Roulet is temporarily detained, Haller figures that's enough time to get to Maggie's sister's house (where Maggie and the daughter are hiding) so he can intercept the now out of control Roulet and call in favor #2 from the biker gang honcho. The once calculating but now impulsive Roulet shows up at Maggie's right on schedule and the gang members end up beating him up in broad daylight. Not likely, but again entertaining.When Haller figures out that Levin had discovered Roulet's parking ticket put him near the scene of Renteria's murder, along with Martinez's possible ID and Corliss's testimony about the spider tattoo, that may be enough to put Roulet away for good.I wasn't very surprised by Roulet's mother admitting to killing Levin and also shooting Haller, as it was pretty obvious from the get go that the mother-son relationship wasn't very kosher. 'The Lincoln Lawyer' may be nothing more than an extended Law & Order episode, but it's still highly entertaining. I didn't buy all of it, especially the rather easy way in which Haller prevents the killer from doing harm to his family. I also wasn't entirely convinced that the DA really had enough evidence to convict Roulet at a second trial. Nonetheless, 'The Lincoln Lawyer', with its realistic atmosphere and excellent performances, proves to be a notch above many of films in wide release today.",The Lincoln Lawyer
48,BeneCumb,Good thriller with twists and pleasant performances,8,5 March 2014,"It is not easy to create an intense thriller where events both inside and outside courtroom are equally significant and catchy - in my opinion, The Lincoln Lawyer has succeeded in this. Although you could guess some of the solutions and the real background was revealed a bit too far, it was still pleasant to follow how the protagonist, lawyer Mickey Haller (distinctively performed by Matthew McConaughey) started to free himself from the situation he was lured. Apart from tragic and dramatics, there are also several occasions you can giggle, particularly within the subheading ""lawyer and his fees""... Apart from McConaughey, there are also nice supporting roles, such as William H. Macy as Frank Levin, John Leguizamo as Val Valenzuela, Laurence Mason as Earl; detectives and prosecutors were a bit too uniform, but this did not devalue the movie in general.Moreover, I am pleased that McConaughey has moved away from trivial romantic comedies and put himself into versatile movies with different approach.

50,freemantle_uk,There is nothing worst then a innocent client,7,21 September 2013,"For a long time Matthew McConaughey career was the butt of many jokes and he was seen as a laughing stock. But in 2011 his career started to have a massive upswing when he starred in The Lincoln Lawyer and his projects have been getting better ever since.Based on a novel by Michael Connery McConaughey stars as Mickey Haller, a defence lawyer who operates around L.A. and is a master of dealing and has gift of the gaff. He is given an opportunity to defend a rich playboy, Louis Roulet (Ryan Phillippe) accused of beating up a woman and claims he is innocent. But as Mickey investigates the case with P.I. Frank Levin (William H. Macy) he discovers that they may have lead to an innocent he represented going to prison.The Lincoln Lawyer is seems typical legal/investigation style film, a little like John Grisham style story in a more gritty, urban setting. Screen writing John Romano does a fine job, adapting what seems to be a novel with lots of subplots and was able to wrap it all together. The story was able to handled very well by Romano and director Brad Furman as the story turns from whether his client is guilty or not to a story about stopping someone who is evil but with his hands tied behind his back. It made of a compelling courtroom and investigative film, even if it does a little too much legal jargon. But the film is easy to follow for the most part.The Lincoln Lawyer has a great cast, McConaughey, Marisa Tomei, John Leguizamo, Macy, Michael Peña and fanboy favourite Bryan Cranston. McConaughey as he plays a anti-hero and is not the typical hunky hero he has played. Mickey is a sleazy guy and comes across a snake oil salesman as he deals and bents the rules, yet grows into someone more likable as the film progresses. Tomei is an actor I like and Leguizamo was solid. Cranston does not have much time to make an impression and many of the big name actors were in fairly small roles. Peña was sadly disappointing in his role and Phillippe is an actor I find it hard to warm to; yet he was decent enough.Furman does inject some style when directing particularly in the beginning when Louis tells his story and the camera pans to see the flashback. But the cinematography was terrible, coming from Lukas Ettlin who also filmed Battle Los Angeles, uses too much shaky cam when he should have used a tripod or steady cam and he used sudden zooms that made the film look amateurish.The Lincoln Lawyer is a solid legal thriller that will please the fans of the genre.",The Lincoln Lawyer
51,dfranzen70,"It's not all right, all right, all right",5,7 April 2011,"If you are a fan of the film adaptations of the John Grisham legal thrillers, you might find quite a bit to like about The Lincoln Lawyer, a courtroom drama that treads on familiar ground in an effort to lead to a fairly predictable conclusion. It's not particularly memorable.Matthew McConnaughey stars as Mick Haller, a high-powered lawyer who operates (mostly) out of his Lincoln Town Car, shepherded around by a besuited driver. At least that's the idea – he's in the car for maybe three or four scenes. Anyway, he's been hired by the family of a rich lad, played by Ryan Phillippe, who's accused of battering a woman in her home after she picked him up at a local bar. But it's not long before Haller realizes that the case may have something to do with an earlier case of his, one in which his client (Michael Pena) wound up being sent to San Quentin. Seems like there may be quite a bit more to this rich kid's case than meets the eye.Haller is typical of the heroes you see in those Grisham novels/films. He knows when to play the system and when to buck it. He's a family man, even though he and his wife, played by the luminous Marisa Tomei, are divorced. He puts in long hours to work on his cases – and why not, he gets a lot of money for doing so. He has an experienced investigator, played by a scruffy-looking William H. Macy. He doesn't have the affected twang of a Grisham hero, so his shtick here is his omnipresent Lincoln. Except when it's not present, which is really quite often.Matthew McConnaughey tries his best, just as he does in most movies, but he's just up against too much predictability. As likable as he can be in character – even when he's a bit of a jerk, like in Tropic Thunder, which got him this gig – his likability can only carry a picture so far. And although it helps that there are a lot of talented folks in the movie with him, their cache combined just isn't enough to overcome the overwrought, indifferent, cliché-riddled plot. McConnaughy is charming and sly, working the refs so effortlessly as an ethically challenged lawyer, that you almost forget that the conclusion is basically forgone. Oh, sure there's a twist, if you can call it that. The movie even wants us to believe there are two of them.But The Lincoln Lawyer is just full of McGuffins, too many incidental characters who nevertheless Mean Something, and way too much wasted talent. It's done in by implausibilities and the notion that only the Hero can figure anything out – if he doesn't, it means he's been set up or lied to. It's even sort of repetitive to have McConnaughey as the lead here; he already had the experience of being the Hero in the adaptation of Grisham's A Time to Kill.So, skip it. When your movie's big hook is that your hero operates his law practice out of his car, and then you show him driving himself around in other cars, or being driven around in other cars, or being in court, or basically doing everything but conduct business out of the back of his car, then you have no hook. And, ergo, no movie.",The Lincoln Lawyer

Another surprise is Ryan Phillippe's excellent performance which also adds considerably to the movie's entertainment value as his character spars with Mr. McConaughey's.

53,estebangonzalez10,The Lincoln Lawyer is Intense,8,21 June 2011,"¨I checked the list of people I trust and your name ain't on it.¨ The Lincoln Lawyer reminded me of one of those Grisham novels, but this thrilling drama was actually based on a Michael Connelly novel (as was Clint Eastwood's Blood Work). The film has a lot of twists and surprises, but the true success of the movie relies on Matthew McConaughey's performance. His charisma and spark are what make this film work, and he didn't even have to take his t-shirt off this time. Relatively unknown director, Brad Furman, has made one of the best thrillers of the year. The script was adapted really well by John Romano as he handles all the twists really well. The court room scenes were actually intense and reminded me of other great lawyer films as Primal Fear. The movie begins pretty slow, it takes a while before it picks up. I had no idea where the film was going to go after it presented one twist and turn after another. I actually appreciated that the most from this movie because I couldn't predict what was going to happen next. The plot seemed so simple at first, but once we get to the halfway point it's hard to know what direction the story is going to take. Even at the end so many things came together so every piece of the puzzle fit in nicely. I really enjoyed this film; it's a smart, intelligent thriller with a strong and reliable performance from Matthew McConaughey.The title gets its name from the Lincoln Town car that defense lawyer, Mick Haller (Matthew McConaughey), operates from. He spends most of his time in the vehicle with his chauffeur Earl (Laurence Mason) so he uses it as his personal office. Mick is a smart lawyer who actually learned all the shortcuts in his profession. He is street smart and doesn't mind if his clients are actually innocent or not. He gets a huge break when a young realtor named Louis Roulet (Ryan Phillippe) asks him to defend his case after being charged for raping and beating a prostitute. Louis claims to be innocent and says the whole thing was a setup since his family is very wealthy. Mick doesn't care if he's innocent or not, what he wants are all the facts so that he can defend the case against prosecutor Ted Minton (Josh Lucas). Along with his private investigator, Frank Levin (William H. Macy), Mick discovers that there is more to this case than what Louis is telling them. He links this case to a previous one he had years ago where he just now realizes has sent an innocent man to jail. His name was Jesus Martinez (Michael Peña) and Mick was his defense attorney who made him plead guilty so he would get a reduced sentence instead. The film begins to take several twists and turns from this point on and it picks up in intensity. There is another subplot to this story involving Mick's relationship with his ex wife, Maggie (Marisa Tomei), a prosecutor, but the story isn't developed really well as it focuses more on Haller and the case.I guess the subplot was introduced because you can't waist the talents of such a great actress as Marisa Tomei. She's great in the few scenes she has in this film, but her story and relationship with Mick isn't developed very well. John Leguizamo and Bryan Cranston also have secondary roles, but we've seen them do better work in the past. The true star of the film is Matthew McConaughey and he carries the movie with the help of some good performances from Ryan Phillippe and William H. Macy. So yes, there is an interesting cast in The Lincoln Lawyer, but the success is mostly thanks to a great outstanding performance from McConaughey. The movie is intense, has interesting twists, and the court room scenes felt authentic. We can see these characters as real lawyers and the situations are very plausible. That is why I was reminded so much of a Grisham novel because the situations felt real. It's hard to find interesting and smart films, so I was pleased with this movie because it isn't only intelligent, it's also entertaining and has some decent thrills; it's complete.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",The Lincoln Lawyer

Great (based on a book) story following a slick but ethically challenged defence attorney who lands a high profile case, defending a rich playboy (Ryan Phillippe) accused of assaulting a prostitute. Initially the case appears to be straightforward with a high payoff but soon develops into a deadly game of manipulation.This kept me on my toes as I was never sure fully how the story was going to play out. Matthew McConaughey takes the lead as 'Micky' and I have to say, he is just fantastic in these dramatic roles, (sadly) he should keep his shirt on more often and give the romantic comedies a break. Fantastic cast attached here too, familiar faces just kept popping up with great performances from all (William H. Macy, Bryan Cranston, Frances Fisher, John Leguizamo, Josh Lucas, Marisa Tomei, Michael Peña) All the characters were well fleshed out too especially McConaughey, who is so slick at working the system. I liked his relationship with, well everyone, Earl his driver, Tomei as his (we love each other but can't live together) Ex, Macy as his BFF investigator, Trace Atkins and all the bikers and it was a fun touch having him work out of the back of his Lincoln Sedan (hence the title) as he tends to drink a fair bit. 12/8/14",The Lincoln Lawyer
57,Enchorde,A superb crime thriller with an impressive cast.,8,19 September 2011,"The Lincoln Lawyer is about Mick Haller, a shady lawyer that with a winning smile and tongue in cheek approach runs his successful business from the backseat of his Lincoln. But suddenly a really big case falls into his lap. A young rich man, Roulet, stands accused for attacking a prostitute, and by the looks of it seems framed. But Haller hasn't much more than agreed to try the case until the lies starts. Haller soon discovers that the case has ties to one that Haller tried years ago, one where a now seemingly innocent man serves prison for life, and that Haller himself is trapped under the rules of attorney client privilege. The clear cut case is now a fight for his life.This is a real good crime story. It got a few twists and turns, but no real surprises. But the suspense is not built with the unknown, but with knowing exactly who did it and the hero being helpless to do anything about it. How will he solve it. Much relies on good acting, and fortunately the cast is impressive. Matthew McConaughey is real good, and with support from Macy, Tomei, Phillipe, Mason, just to name a few of the known actors, the acting can't be anything but brilliant.The suspense is tight all the way, and the Lincoln Lawyer one of the best crime thrillers I've seen in recent years. Suspense combined with a touch of humor and heart, it is entertaining all the way. And for once everything isn't explained explicitly, you have to pay attention to get it right. Finally.Highly recommended.8/10",The Lincoln Lawyer

60,AudioFileZ,"Lawyers, Guns, & Money...Plus An Old Lincoln, What's Not To Like?",8,24 April 2011,"I just finished watching ""The Lincoln Lawyer"" and I am glad to say Matthew McConaughey is back as that fine serious actor he formerly showed he was capable of in ""A Time To Kill"". This movie delivers on all cylinders: story/screenplay, cinematography, and acting. Besides McConaughey we have the always great William H. Macy as well as much better than average window dressing with Marisa Tomei as McConaughey's ex who works in the DA's office. Tomei's character is at odds with her ex due to his defense of ""bottom feeders"", but they have a daughter together and still have a spark unrequited which adds a certain amount of humanity in the otherwise ""tougher than nails"" very eccentric lawyer played by McConaughey.The story begins as a predictably shady bail bondsman, a fine cameo played by the versatile John Leguizamo, throws a big money case to McConaughey. The case involves a rich young real estate heir who is accused of a vicious rape. Right away the story's many twists start as there is both something not right about the accused as well as the case falling into McConaughey's lap. Ryan Fillippe gives a cold, if not entirely the best, performance of the sadistic young tycoon. I won't spoil the many turns as they require the viewer's constant attention and, overall, are exactly what elevates the drama into rarefied territory. The ""quirks"" of the story, such as a lawyer who uses a chauffeur driven old Lincoln as his office, only add to the whole and thus seem to be exactly right.""The Lincoln Lawyer"" kept me fully invested and interested throughout. The ending was the clincher as it was in no way a let-down to a overall excellent crime drama.",The Lincoln Lawyer

62,rgkarim,Lincoln Lawyer is good!,8,19 March 2011,"Review for the Lincoln Lawyer The Lincoln Lawyer, another movie about the drama present inside and outside the courtroom. The movie starts out with a little background information, not much, on Matthew McConaughey's character. It immediately jumps in to the big case and gets the pace going fast as they dive into happenings of the case. Once this happens, the movie begins to feel like an episode of CSI where the possible scenarios are explained through flashbacks that sometimes have choppy camera action limits the scenes. Eventually you get back to the current time where it plays out once again like CSI where there are multiple attempts to explain what is going on and who the real culprit is.Over the course of this movie, you meet a lot of interesting characters that are played by strong actors from plenty of other movies. McConaughey plays the part solid and seems to fit naturally into the role, of a calm, cool, slimy lawyer who can make deals with a lot of people. Marisa Tomei plays the devoted mother and lawyer of justice that balances out McConaughey's impulsive and sleazy behavior. My favorite characters were the chauffeur and the right hand man who added some comedic relief to the movie, helping to relieve some of the suspense and tension that were built into it. Ryan Phillipe also played the role well as the stuck up, corrupt rich boy that was annoying to his lawyer. Overall the acting was superb, though at some points was overacted such as seen in many daytime soap operas.Another aspect to look at is the musical score of this movie. In some of the scenes the music goes really well with the intensity of the scene. The orchestra work adds a lot of character to the suspense of some scenes, but at the same time shows hope and promise. However, there are other points where this movie plays a lot of rap typically when they are scanning over the city of L.A. I found the music to be a little distracting, but perhaps others will like the selection they composers of chosen. Most are aggressive rap that are attacking the city, and give the environment some street feeling to it.In my opinion however, the biggest strength this movie has is the establishing of characters that you can relate too. Many of the cast bring a lot of life to the roles and keep it interesting and on the edge as the movie proceeds. Over the course of the movie, the antagonist begins to really make one angry because of the dishonesty this character shows and the enjoyment he has of other people suffering. I found myself continuously wanting this man to die, especially after a few of the scandals he has pulled in his past that make him evil scum. His cruel nature to let others take the fall and act incredibly spoiled and carefree make you hate him for his superiority complex. Unfortunately the law prevents him from being brought to justice in a direct manner and thus a new plan has to be made for him to be brought to justice. That plan and the pieces that fall into place are what keep this movie interesting. You keep guessing clues as to how that is going to happen and what is going to take place. When the plan finally comes together you laugh at the plan about how funny it is and the justice dealt.The main weaknesses of this movie start with some of the offensive language the characters use. The antagonist especially has a lot of harsh language that some may find offensive. Again it helps paint him as an evil character, but it doesn't need to go to that extreme. Next is there are a lot of sexual references and prostitute references that kind of paint the characters, but at the same time seem to rob the movie of its quality making it seem more of a more expensive CIS episode with a weak victim. The last thing is some of the movie is predictable if you think about who is going to be involved. The beginning introduces a lot of characters in the movie that you know are going to be important and you keep wondering what role they are going to play. Most of the roles are small and weak and really don't strengthen the story too much.Overall though this movie was very enjoyable and interesting and felt like you were involved in the case. The skills of the actors, the play of music, and the coming together of the story all make for a winning project. Although there are a few flaws this movie overall deserves an 8-8.5 in my opinion and should be a big hit for those that love CSI, Law and Order and other crime dramas will love. Other people who will enjoy this movie are Matthew McConaughey fanatics, lawyers and case study fans, and people who are in favor of a good story. People who will probably not like this are science fiction lovers, action fans, and chick flick fans as there is very little of these concepts in this movie. But again I am only one person and I hope you enjoy the film as much as I did.",The Lincoln Lawyer
63,burlesonjesse5,Matthew McConaughey shines in entertaining Lawyer,7,9 May 2014,"With a juicy script, strong performances, and harmless t.v. cop show overtones, The Lincoln Lawyer is an entertaining, fly by the seat of your pants ride. It also represents some of the best acting you'll ever see by Matthew McConaughey. He plays with confidence and aggression, a morally misguided defense attorney representing some shady (mostly guilty) clients. On the way to his court appointments or meetings with his defendants, he rides in a Lincoln Town Car (with his own personal driver I might add).Involving and absorbing yet containing a few plot holes (not to mention unsure character motives), this film nevertheless glides by on its slick, no nonsense approach. What The Lincoln Lawyer doesn't answer though, is whether or not to root for or feel any sympathy towards McConaughey's character (Mickey Haller). If you can get past that, basically you're left with a courtroom drama, a lightweight character study, and a hip hop music video all rolled up into one. I just wish that it didn't conclude without tying up a few loose ends first. However, The Lincoln Lawyer is, what I think to be a great ""movie night"" selection. Let's just call it the Citizen Kane of nightly rentals.",The Lincoln Lawyer
64,raulfaust,Power and Law,6,26 July 2012,"Well, in most movies involving relationships between attorney and client there's a big doubt in the lawyer's head if his client is guilty or not. Either way, he's always willing to do his best to defend his client, since it is his job. In this picture things may change; the attorney KNOWS his client is the murderer-- he's been told by the client itself-- and needs to find a way to incriminate him. However, we all know once the lawyer is hired (and paid), he has to do his job-- if he's ethical, naturally. From this plot come lots of problems involving old clients and the current defendant. Acting is good most of the time, with exception of Ryan Phillippe-- he used to be much better in ""Cruel Intentions"", I don't know what happened to him. Matthew McConaughey proves to be a good actor, albeit sometimes he seems to be a little over the top. ""The Lincoln Lawyer"" is a good picture, but something made me dislike the movie in some scenes.",The Lincoln Lawyer
65,bob-rutzel-1,Very good story,8,22 July 2011,"Criminal lawyer Mickey Haller (McConaughey) uses a Lincoln sedan as his office. He takes on a case that is similar to one he took years ago when his client got life and wasn't guilty. Seems we cannot see a story where the main character (McConaughey) is married, to someone who seems, to us, to be perfect for him. No, we are constantly subjected to a divorce situation. This is Hollywood constantly bringing this strife to us as if this is the norm for all America. Aside from the main plot they do this to introduce more conflict. And, without conflict we don't have much of a story. However, in here we see a very cordial divorce relationship even though ex-wife (Tomei) doesn't like his defending lowlifes and getting them off so they can return to the world to do all the bad stuff all over again. Other than that we see no reason for the divorce situation. But, there is more to all of this. We see a corrupt legal system and Haller uses all of it, as he has succumbed to it. I guess we could call him a sleazy lawyer. In the beginning we see Haller in complete control of his life and surroundings, and his attitude is kind of flip about everything, but that changes somewhat when he gets caught between a rock and a hard place. The acting is good all around with one exception. No CGI, explosions, shooting blitzes, or chases but the pace was exceptionally good throughout and didn't need any of that. McConaughey didn't bare his torso for this as he usually does in other films. Macy seems to like playing characters who are rife with unkempt hair. Tormei is beautiful and has a smile to die for. Trace Adkins as the biker leader is probably at home on a bike, was hard to recognize (I thought he was Wilford Brimley), but the voice gave him away. Ryan Phillippe (the exception noted above) didn't convince as the pretty boy rapist/killer (he needs to play good guy roles).All in all a very good story with a couple twists and it was nice to see McConaughey lose the flipiness to show us a concerned person especially when he realizes the similarities between this case and one long ago, and also when his family was being threatened. Next up are The Camry Lawyer, The Sonata Lawyer and The Civic Lawyer. Stay tuned. (HA! I just couldn't resist)Violence: Yes. Sex: No, you see a make-out session in the dark. Nudity: No. Language: Yes, one F-bomb which you could miss as it was said under one's breath.",The Lincoln Lawyer
66,moviexclusive,"Crackling with tension and suspense, and buoyed by an excellent performance by Matthew McConaughey, this twisty and well-plotted legal thriller is one of the best in years",8,22 March 2011,"Matthew McConaughey returns to the courtroom- after a string of rom-coms that had all but typecast him as the romantic cad- to play the sleek, smarmy and hustling defense attorney Mick Haller, a famed Michael Connelly character whose first appearance was in the book on which this film is based. It was back in 1996 when McConaughey first made his mark in Hollywood with a stunning lead debut in the legal thriller ""A Time to Kill"", and it seems the years have not dimmed his ability to light up a courtroom. With his signature slick charm, toothy grin and Southern drawl, McConaughey is dynamic as ever in ""The Lincoln Lawyer"", the title a reference to his character's workplace- the back seat of a Lincoln Continental whose registration plate reads ""NTGUILTY"". Haller is chauffeured from courtroom to courtroom across Los Angeles by Earl (Lawrence Mason), a former client now offering his services in lieu of legal fees. His clientele belong in the rock-bottom of society- biker gangs, drug dealers, and prostitutes- and because of this, Haller's expertise lies in negotiating plea bargains through finding loopholes that can get crucial evidence thrown out of court. Cajoling, wheedling and sweet-talking are the tools of his trade- very early on, we see Haller sweet-talking a bailiff to get a case advanced on the docket, deliberately delaying the trial of a biker until he gets his fee, and plea bargaining on behalf of a hooker who accepted payment in crack cocaine- and McConaughey's cocksure ease fits just right with his character. His latest client however is somewhat different, a Beverly Hills rich kid called Louis Roulet (Ryan Phillippe) who is being charged with assault and battery of a female escort. Haller knows that he has struck gold, but the case starts becoming more complicated when Louis insists that he is innocent and flatly refuses to accept any plea bargain. The trailer will reveal more, but as with any crime thriller, the less you know the better. Suffice to say that veteran crime screenwriter John Romano has retained all the elements of Connelly's twisty, cleverly plotted thriller, including Roulet's overprotective matriarchal parent Mary Windsor (Frances Fisher), Haller's reliable investigator Frank Levin (William H. Macy) and Haller's ex-wife-cum-prosecutor Maggie McPherson (Marisa Tomei). Other characters that readers of Connelly's book will instantly recognise are the bail bondsman Val (John Leguizamo) through whom Haller gets Roulet's case, and Haller's former client Jesus Martinez (Michael Pena) intimately connected with his latest case. Romano had the unenviable task of condensing Connelly's page-turning novel into a two-hour movie, and he does so superbly without losing any of the tension or suspense in the story. He also loses none of Connelly's debates about the vagaries in the justice system, seeing as how attorneys like Haller manage to put the innocent in jail and the guilty back out on the streets. Haller's crisis of conscience is also at the heart of the movie, and McConaughey gets to do some serious acting when his character is eventually confronted with the magnitude of his past follies. On his part, director Brad Furman (The Take) keeps the pace of the movie crackling every step of the way, making this as much of a gripping yarn as reading Connelly's novel. Furman's most significant accomplishment is in employing Lukas Ettlin's cinematography to give the movie a great sense of place amidst the less glamorous streets of Los Angeles, an unpretty look that suits the theme of the story just fine. Of course, Furman and Ettlin are equally adept when it comes to courtroom drama, and the back-and-forth questioning by Haller and the inexperienced prosecutor (Josh Lucas) unfolds with sizzling rhythm. Kudos to Furman too for assembling a top-notch ensemble cast who do outstandingly in their various supporting roles- especially William H. Macy as the wisecracking investigator, and Shea Whigham as a colourful jailhouse snitch called on the prosecution to testify against Roulet. But the actor that holds the movie from start to finish is McConaughey- and just as how ""The Lincoln Lawyer"" became a star-making turn for Connelly regular Mick Haller, McConaughey's performance here will also be a similarly definitive turn as the on screen rendition of that character.",The Lincoln Lawyer

He is a decent actor but hey he is not Brad Pitt (Which he thinks he Is) Matthew got lucky this time as this role suited him perfectly; he was cocky yet smart and knew how to play a character which is hateful in beginning but has a heart to it.

69,sme_no_densetsu,Instantly forgettable but well-crafted nonetheless,7,27 June 2011,"""The Lincoln Lawyer"" centres on unconventional defence lawyer Mickey Haller (Matthew McConaughey), who operates out of the back of his Lincoln. When a high profile case is thrown his way he proceeds as usual though he suspects that his client isn't being completely honest with him. His concerns are substantiated when, in reviewing the evidence against his client, he spots an apparent link to a previous case of his.First off, the cast leaves little to be desired. McConaughey ably carries the picture and he's given a better than average supporting cast. You could argue that some of these individuals weren't utilized to the utmost of their abilities but it's always nice to have the likes of William H. Macy, Marisa Tomei & Michael Peña on board. Surprisingly, though, I'd say that the best supporting performance came from Ryan Phillippe.The story & script are better than average but hardly original. The film's supposed hook (ie. Haller operating out of his Lincoln) is a minor point in the scheme of things. That being said, the story does keep you interested and entertained throughout. Meanwhile, the direction's capable but unremarkable though the soundtrack shows a bit more style.Overall, ""The Lincoln Lawyer"" is a perfectly acceptable piece of entertainment but nothing more. It's undeniably well-crafted but it lacks that certain something to set it apart from countless other legal thrillers.",The Lincoln Lawyer
70,Troy_Campbell,"A suspenseful, no-frills court room thriller.",7,6 April 2011,"It's refreshing to see a thriller that revels in the simplicities of cinema. No unnecessary bells and whistles, just a decent story told well. The Lincoln Lawyer harks back to a day when audiences didn't require twists on top of turns wrapped in double-crossing interwoven with deceit and covered in lies to stay entertained; one or two intelligent reveals is more than enough to keep you on the edge of your seat. In a time where MTV-influenced editing and sound design has replaced clever narratives and honest acting, it's actually a bold move for director Furman, but it pays off in spades.Furman, whose only other feature is the little known The Take from 2007, sticks to the old-school mentality of making movies and largely keeps his lens motionless, allowing the plot and the actors to take centre stage. Sure, he spruces up the opening credits with some glitzy split screens and wonderful vehicle POV shots; however this is where the flashy filmmaking begins and ends. His willingness to stay grounded and keep the camera-work basic offers John Romano's script – which would be right at home in the fifties, with the sharp dialogue nudging the picture into semi-noir territory – room to breathe and subsequently gifts the cast with a chance to really chew down on the material. They don't disappoint.McConaughey, Mr Abs himself, makes a strong argument that he deserves more in his career than fluffy rom-coms opposite Kate Hudson. He's required to transform across the running time from an arrogant, suave lawyer who has no regrets to a guilt-ridden man who just wants to protect his family and friends, and there's not a hint of hollowness in his performance. Strong supporting work is dished up by Tomei as Haller's ex-wife, Macy as a private investigator and Lucas as an out-his-league prosecutor; unfortunately though Phillippe is a weak link, he somehow never convinces in his fairly easy role and almost looks like he's disinterested to be there.A suspenseful, no-frills court room thriller.3.5 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Average, 3 - Good, 4 - Great, 5 - Brilliant)",The Lincoln Lawyer

His sleaziness is entertaining, but his lawyering is smart and intriguing. This film has pretty much the perfect mix of a smart plot, with inventive twists, amusing one-liners, and captivating thought-out characters.Limited action and instead using characters who have an actual story, we get a film that sets itself above its competitors. A charming, but also smart and strong, Matthew McConaughey introduces us to a lawyer who has a few inner turmoils that develop along with the plot. There may be a few too many twists in the story (and with the camera), but the evolution of McConaughey's Haller is rather subtle and not cliché.Questions of innocence versus guilt surround Louis (Ryan Phillippe) as Haller agrees to take on his case. But as the case starts to collide with incidents of the past, present and future, similar questions of guilt and innocence start plaguing Haller, his other clients, and the other lawyers.

Many of the year's best movies have taken very simple premises, some you might even expect to find on a TNT matinée rather than a move theater, done with some nifty but commonplace execution and retaining some terrific merit. There might not be a better example this year than Brad Furman's ""The Lincoln Lawyer"" a superb crime-drama based on a novel by bestselling writer Michael Connelly. No explosions are set off, few shots are fired, and fewer big plot twists are tossed in the face of the audience, and yet so much entertainment value is aroused in this splendidly enjoyable movie with some commonplace, but smartly-treated themes about the current state of crime and punishment.Matthew McConaughey has guaranteed himself an Academy Award nomation (and I hope a win) in this film, playing a smart-alec, streetwise defense attorney who knows every trick in the book and every loophole in the lawbooks. He moves about from point to point in town via his Lincoln automobile, with license plate tags reading ""NTGUILTY."" An associate of him hands him a case promising big bucks: defending a preppy, rich-kid (Ryan Phillipe) who turns out to be not as dumb and sloppy as he appears. For not only does Mr. McConaughey learn that his client is guilty of murdering a prostitute, but also of framing one of his earlier clients, whom he could not save from prison, and who is prepared to do the same to him should he not use his wheeler-dealer legal tricks to get him off.A fascinating premise, but what exactly keeps ""The Lincoln Lawyer"" from just subjugating itself to a TV-crime drama? Not only is it aware of the public outcries tossed up at defense attorneys letting obviously-guilty murderers, rapists, and what-not essentially getting free rides from society, but it knows how to play with them in a way that is borderline-fantasy but still effective. It would have been all too easy to have the protagonist all of a sudden turn into an action dummy, climb ladders, jump off roofs, and chase baddies through the highways on foot or behind the wheel, but it relies in psychology and a really sharp screenplay by John Romano to tackle the issue. And although Mr. McConaughey does outsmart the villains and sets up political traps and swindle all around him, it's also exposing some of the flaws - if one chooses to call them that - in the legal system. And it does not cop out at the end as one might expect it to, with the lawyer ""learning his lesson"" so to speak. It plays it smart, just like the character.But the movie really rides on the fabulous performance by Matthew McConaughey, who is perfectly matched to the part and furthermore does what every great actor should do with every part they get: communicate a sense of joy in performing. Watching Mr. McConaughey on-screen is like sharing his experience of playing the part. You can see that he is having the time of his life playing this sleazy, not-so-sympathetic character and the excitement is felt by the audience too. Other parts are played very well. Ryan Phillipe, as the villainous do-badder, plays against his type and does it well, but without ham-acting: he's clever with the part just like his character is with everyone around him. As a former flame and prosecutor, Marisa Tomei gives another endearing performance. Also memorable is William H. Macy, who keeps growing as an actor along with the length of his hair. A rare but still-recognizable face in movies, Frances Fisher, is also competent as the villain's loving mother.It's a real surprise and an even bigger joy that evidently somebody thought this picture was better than a small-frame television format and deserved to be put on a big screen. For that is where it belongs. Perhaps it is not a film that will be discussed fifty years from now, but it is a timely piece and will likely keep that down the road and in 2011, it's a rather nice surprise.",The Lincoln Lawyer

Roadmaps that address court dramas are not new and have been adapted to film several opportunities. When the events and characters are well developed and tied in such a way that the suspense and surprises arise until the last minute, it is virtually certain success at the box office. With a budget of $ 40 million and based on the best-selling book by Michael Connelly, written by John Romano performs a job well structured and efficient when it proposes with a great script, an aesthetic 70s and a lot of familiar faces from the general public.Furman presents the protagonist in the first minutes of the film, showing how he treats his customers in his car, and then acting in some cases in full chain, showing us a bit of intelligence Mick and what are their methods of making agreements with prosecutors and his coldness to negotiate with criminals. The screenplay by John Romano also hit by treating their subplots significantly, additional investigation and the main trial. Others are less explored, but we understand them very well, as Mick's relationship with his ex-wife and his assistant driver Earl. Another risky is the revelation of the perpetrator prematurely. From that point, the script no longer an investigative thriller try to assemble the puzzle to find on your end who was the real killer and show the contractor Mick was telling the truth or not. The script goes on to win an air of psychological drama to put the conscience and sense of justice Mick proof. He will need to continue to do their work, but going to face the threat to his family and to fix a past mistake in search of redemption. The end ends up losing a little too late to show multiple. Some are very smart, others seem only attempts to try to surprise the audience even more.The direction of Furman has characteristics make the TV series American police by his way of filming and of course, for its investigative plot. He works with very little open plans and favors close-ups and hand- held cameras to insert the viewer directly into the scene and to address more existential issues, especially those involving more action, giving overall a thriller constant all the time. Moreover, the closed plans show the chaos in the mind of the protagonist, especially when he begins to piece together the thriller from the latter half of the projection. He also abuses the scenes of traveling in time that would normally be used more fixed cameras, as the scenes of the court. It becomes exaggerated the constant movement of the camera, but ends up running for also give more impetus to the scene. Some sequences are, however, very well accomplished. There is a sequence he goes walking through the corridors of the court talking to a colleague at the beginning of the film, and another later in the death of a character, in which the camera follows Mick out of her car, runs up and goes into a sort of townhouse to meet the body lying in the living room of the house.Matthew McConaughey is the main factor that makes the story work and earn credibility. Your character Mick is unveiled in the first half hour of the plot. It is a criminal who has his office in the car which has among its clients or guilty people generally unreliable. He knows how to act within the law but has the trickery of the streets and knows the streets and crime. The wheel he has his squire Earl (Laurence Manson). Mick knows who is good at it and the registration plate of your car reveals his confidence: NTGUILTY (not guilty). In the courts, knows how to get the information to the right people through the small ""aid money"" to get inside information from their cases. For payment, he does not hesitate to postpone the process leaving your customer a little more in jail if he does not get the deal. Besides the good performance of McConaughey, we see familiar faces and always deliver interesting performances. Marisa Tomei as public prosecutor and former wife of Mick, Maggie, William H. Macy as the investigator Frank Levin, John Lenguizamo as Val Valenzuela and Josh Lucas as Ted Minton promoter. Besides Michael Peña in the small but important role of Jesus Martinez, Bryan Cranston of ""Breaking Bad"" series, and Katherine Moennig. The only one who seems not so convincing in the role of a playboy of questionable character Ryan Phillippe is Louis Roulet with her. But the actor does not quite compromising other performances.The Lincoln Lawyer got good reviews from critics, and has billed $ 57 million at the box office, a figure considered high for a courtroom drama. And for good reason. Many factors contribute to this. Several well-known names a dynamic script and progresses naturally and not abusing legal jargon leaving everything to the public educational policy, an issue agile Jeff McEvoy, a picture that blends well with the daytime scenes suspenseful night led by Lukas Ettlin and a soundtrack by Cliff Martinez without compromising supported the songs that dictate the universe and the characters are inserted. The twists and constant atmosphere of suspense even after the premature disclosure of the offender, and the good performances already guarantee sure you leave satisfied from exhibition.",The Lincoln Lawyer
75,gregsrants,So-So Crime Thriller,5,8 March 2011,"Michael Connelly is a bestselling author. I know this because of the amount of times I see his name plastered on book covers that are being engrossed by any of my fellow train passengers as I head to the city each morning. Connelly, J.K. Rowling and Nora Roberts seem to lead the parade as authors of trip pleasing books so it was no surprise when Connelly's The Lincoln Lawyer was optioned for a big screen adaptation with A-List stars such as Mathew McConaughey, Marisa Tomei and Ryan Phillippe attached to star.The Lincoln Lawyer tells the story of Mick Haller (McConaughey), a lawyer in California that conducts business from the back of a Lincoln town car. Mick seems to be a genius in manipulating the system for his client's benefits and his good-looks and confident swagger seem to endear him to all those whom he crosses paths.Thanks to a tip from Bail Bondsman Val (John Leguizamo) suggesting a large financial windfall, Mick takes the case Louis Roulet (Phillippe), a rich, Beverly Hills boy who stands accused of badly beating a prostitute.At first, the case looks like a slam-dunker. Louis is convincing in his plea of innocence and evidence leads Mick and his lead investigator (played by William H. Macy) to simple conclusions that a trial will be fast and in tipped in their favor.But as Mick grows disillusioned with the prosecutors case (lead by Josh Lucas) he begins to put pieces of the crime puzzle together – pieces that may prove his client is not the innocent framed rich boy he claims.For a film titled, The Lincoln Lawyer, there is not a lot of lawyering going on in the back of the town car. There is the odd scene where transactions are finalized while Mick sits on his leather chauffeur driven interior, but most of the action occurs either in the courtroom or in various rooms where alcohol is readily available to every character.McConaughey shows us that he can still be considered at serious actor a la A Time To Kill and we are grateful he has slithered his way out of the dumb comedies that have been his staple for the past five years.But The Lincoln Lawyer fails to engross audiences in a story that is sometimes too predictable and definitely too faithful in characters to the Connelly novel. Phillippe does a good, if not great, job in his Primal Fear type role, but too many other characters are just thrown into the mix (Bryan Cranston, Michael Pena, Michael Pare, Trace Adkins) in roles that were clearly larger in the book form and could have been amalgamated in the screenplay to make better use of time and plot development.The ending to the film does resolve all outstanding issues, but it still feels hollow. Not only are any and all of the 'twists' unsurprising, but they are also lazily realized by director Brad Furman who struggles with the pacing and keeping a two hour movie not feeling like a three-hour time burner.Not being an avid reader myself, I cannot comment if The Lincoln Lawyer is one of Connelly's best. I would think otherwise. But until Hollywood again adapts his words, we are left with 2002's Bloodwork and The Lincoln Lawyer as the forgettable theatrical entries that wasted the allure of A-list talent.",The Lincoln Lawyer

I know that the writer of the novel on which it is based, Michael Connelly, is very popular and so I'm not surprised to find a well thought out plot with many twists and turns in it. The problem with many films of this type is that you can only really watch (and enjoy) them once but I feel I could enjoy this one if I watched it again even with knowing the eventual outcome. That's testament to the writing, the acting and the whole production of it.

78,deatman9,Much better then I expected.,7,15 November 2012,I was pretty reluctant to watch this movie after hearing about it first mostly due to the fact that it stars mathew mchonagy and ryan phillipie who in my mind are not great actors but here they did a good job could have been better though. The story line was original and engaging it gets you hooked right away.This movie is about a sleasy defense lawyer who does whatever he can to get criminals back on the street. He has no moral problems with this and knows most of his clients are guilty. However when the latest client tries to beat the system he is forced to look deep inside for his morals.This movie was really good but I cant help wonder how good it could of been starring some big names. I personally see Edward Norton as the lawyer and Ryan Gosling and the suspect but what can you do the actors still did good and its still a solid movie.,The Lincoln Lawyer

The only refreshing bit is within the last few minutes, this I found quite different, but it does come ""upon you"" pretty quick. This kind of language and the way the U S judicial system appears to work (if this film is anything to go by) make this an ""Only once"" film and its off to the charity shop.",The Lincoln Lawyer
80,JohnRayPeterson,"A thriller the way we like them, fast pace yet slow to emerge.",8,13 May 2011,"The movie has a quality cast of pros and veterans; you will recognize and like the cast I'm sure. Aside from the usual technical legal errors most movies of this genre, criminal legal case, always make and for which the unsuspecting public is not hung up about, the storyline works. The movie is more of an action thriller than it is a dramatic thriller; by dramatic thriller, I'll give the movie ""Fracture"" as an example and for action thriller I might cite ""Along Came a Spider"". Anyway, fan or not of McConaughey, you should be as satisfied of his performance as a lawyer in this movie as you were in his performance in ""A Time To Kill""; I'm merely referring to McConaughey's performance. The Lawyer Mick Haller, played by McConaughey in this movie, is a smarter and more seasoned lawyer than Jake Brigance but an equally passionate one. Michael Peña plays a small secondary but critical role, that of Jesus Martinez, and he delivers a good performance, as well as any of your preferred supporting role actor would; he conveys very well the transformation a term in prison would leave on a man, especially an innocent one. It is when McConaughey comes to that realization, that all the parts of the movie find their designated place. It is a movie I was not leaving my seat for unless I absolutely had to, and thankfully I did not. The pace is intentionally fast and works for the circumstances and the characters; editing was very well done in this regard. The movie does not reveal any grand truth nor lesser thought of human failing, just the tried and true ""justice can prevail"" despite the odds. It's a Hollywood movie that works; they still can make those, be it with less frequency than before. Stock up on the treats. The ratings will make the producers proud; I checked my usual sources, some rating higher and a few lower than the IMDb's 7.5 as of the time I wrote this review. It was time Matthew McConaughey got a movie worth talking about, well in generous terms.",The Lincoln Lawyer
81,Likes_Ninjas90,Matthew McConaughey has found the right character to believably immerse himself into with complete assurance,6,30 March 2011,"In Los Angeles an oily lawyer named Mick Haller (Matthew McConaughey) works to defend criminals in court. Having lost his driver's license sometime ago, he's chauffeured around by his driver Earl (Laurence Mason). Mick is assigned by bail bondsman Val (John Leguizamo) to talk to a rich, young hoodlum, Louis Roulet (Ryan Phillippe). He has been arrested and charged with breaking into the home of a prostitute and assaulting her. The case hangs in a difficult balance because although it seems certain that Roulet is guilty, he admits to carrying a knife with him that was used during the crime, his insistence of his innocence still convinces. Mick works the case with the help of his sidekick Frank (William H. Macy), an investigator and as they move in on the case the tension between himself and Roulet continues to rise. Roulet refuses to take a plea bargain and spend any time in gaol. His continuous pressure makes Mick fear that his family, including his ex-wife Maggie (Marisa Tomei), who is a prosecutor and their daughter, might be in danger. I wish The Lincoln Lawyer was as slick as its leading character. Director Brad Furman has adapted Michael Connelly's crime fiction novel to make a pretty conventional courtroom thriller. This is the movie version of law and order, minus the tedium. Meaning that as a thriller directed to entertain us, absurd twists and turns in the case must exist to inflate the drama. And with that there are some pretty large contrivances, including a sketchy link to a case that Mick worked on previously and a brutally extreme climax too. This is also one of those crime films where the main characters have a tendency to explain the clues to each other, regardless of whether the audience can keep up. Blink and you'll miss it. Fortunately, the two conflicting stories of the case, shown in contrasting flashbacks, add some intrigue to the mystery. Furman has done a reasonable job with the production. It's relatively intense but the direction is also marred by an occasionally lazy visual style, with some unnecessarily erratic camera creeping in.More pleasing are the quality of the performances that Furman draws from the ensemble cast. Matthew McConaughey has found the right character to believably immerse himself into with complete assurance. His guilt brings depth to the role as he considers his failure to defend a previous client and he shows steel in trying to obtain a fair sentence, even if his clients are guilty. Some of his best scenes are in the courtroom itself, courtesy of some strong dialogue by screenwriter John Romano. Mick's words are as precise and as piercing as any weapon, seemingly able to tear people and their claims apart like a bullet from the inside. A solid, charismatic performance. William H. Macy is also very good with some funny lines but he leaves the movie too early. Similarly, Marisa Tomei is fine but her subplot has little impact on the film up until the final climax. With a difficult role Ryan Phillippe impresses. He strikes a crucial balance at times between being a sinister twerp but equally someone who is adamant of his very innocence. These performances add some weight to a decent but largely forgettable thriller.",The Lincoln Lawyer

He puts his suave skills to good use as a morally ambiguous lawyer who operates out of a Lincoln. He delivers a solid performance and elevates the ""procedural crime TV show"" feel of the film.

It is rather well played out even though Ryan Phillippe's performance was completely off, and the direction has no real flaw and is quite dynamic.But the script is utterly banal, classic and predictable from the beginning to the end. No surprises whatsoever, the unfolding of the story and the twists are so telegraphed that they don't produce the desired effect.

I have to say that it was pretty entertaining. McConaughey plays a sleazy lawyer, who works out of his chauffeur driven Lincoln, who takes on a case involving rich boy Phillipe. It moves along very well and you are caught up in the story. One criticism that I do have is that the other characters especially Marisa Tormei as the ex-wife and Phillipe's mother, Frances Fischer, are not as fleshed out as they could have been. William H. Macy has a small but important role and he does wonders with the little time that he is on the screen. The same can be said of Michael Pena and John Leguizamo. I have to say that the music in this film was also very good. Hollywood has learned what TV has learned; if you want to sell something play lots of R & B music.

87,danielmanson,Absolutely loved this!,9,11 April 2021,"Well well well, why have I waited 10 years to watch this. It's a brilliant film.McConaughey is an actor that doesn't overly sell films for me, I've seen a few in the past that have put me off him. But he was fantastic in this, really sold his character well. Might have to start watching more of his films now.So the plot - its great. It's relatively simple in a sense that it's not hard to understand, yet the story has a good 3 to 4 more layers embedded within. So the entire journey through this film you are constantly gripped and wondering what will happen next. It's genuinely a really good plot!My only negative thought with this film is the little storyline he has with his ex wife. Nothing really gets explored with that. We know they split and have a daughter, however they seem to still somewhat get on and in the first hour it hints that it's heading towards being a major part of some plot. But the whole storyline vanishes and focuses on the court case. Which don't get me wrong is for the better as you're watching this for the drama, not romance. But my point is just why include it? They could have just binned off those segments and it wouldn't have made a difference.Overall though I'm very impressed with this film and would recommend to anyone who hasn't seen.",The Lincoln Lawyer

90,willcundallreview,A fine courtroom thriller,8,8 March 2014,"Rating-8/10The Lincoln Lawyer is a thrilling courtroom drama that serves to give the viewer a mystery and a smartly written and acted film. I felt it was a very good film and I can't see why people wouldn't at least find it OK as it's story is yes nothing new, but it is done well and very well of that. The film is definitely worth a watch and if you enjoy this genre of film then just see it as I think it will please those who are even used to the format of the film. Here below is why I believe this film is strongly Very Good.The story as I say maybe not the newest of things but still serves to entertain you and you can't suspect what will happen next in the story. It goes at a nice pace and things are revealed in a way where it is not dragged out, you just know that and have to wait for the next piece of evidence or drama to come. I did enjoy the ending although because so many things happen within the last few minutes of the film, you don't know what is going on and feel it should just end there, they do the ending parts well but it just stretch a lot. Finally on the story it is also witty and not to say it has humour but Matthew McConaughey can be very smart and his comebacks to the more villainous people in this are excellent.McConaughey is great in the role and this is by far one of his strongest roles ever in truth, other people in it such as Marisa Tomei are also good she lead a very emotional performance and so rarely was happy where as most other characters got that chance. I felt the acting together was good and the ensemble did strongly in situations that maybe didn't a custom there talents really. The characters in the film are diverse and by the end you feel this is important because some parts are just a little slow so certain personalities guide you through nicely.I enjoyed the script which was smartly delivered in the courtroom setting and made for a dramatic load of sequences and I particularly liked that the film wasn't always in court, it took us out to gather notes and then we could form our own opinion(but McConaughey does most of the work for us by the end). Direction was solid and was fun with some interesting things going on around the main cast, but in the end whoever made this film as a project decided to make this a dark courtroom thriller and so the film never get's serious enough to really warrant fun and laughter from the main cast(William H. Macy provides a more light performance than most here).It is not too long to be fair to it but maybe some bit's do drag and along with what I said previously about the ending part, there are some bits which start to also drag for example the beginning of the film which I felt yes introduced the characters, but we already knew them well mid introduction. The story as I said isn't predictable but the formula it goes on well, it is similar to many law and order type films which serve to never truly get the bad guy right until the end, this film isn't predictable who is the true perp, but you can still stay very frustrated with the plot that has taken influence from other such things in truth.I said people who enjoy courtroom would enjoy and that is what I stick too because in all truth and all it true. Nothing new to them yes but nevertheless should serve up just enough drama to get you or them glued to the screen in unpredictable circumstances. Many who like straight drama will also like it and those who enjoy smart films where at the end you think ""this plot is sly"", you do feel by the end that the soundtrack also even emphasised certain characters, and makes them seem so much more cool than for what they really did in the story.Overall I give it a 8/10, I nearly gave it a B+ but maybe felt it was too overrating, I don't feel many can call this a great film and my rating is stretching it yes but I believe many will love this. Anyone can enjoy this, and don't feel that if you don't watch many films in this kind of setting, you can't enjoy it, you can I assure you because it has other good assets and any fan of Matthew McConaughey should really enjoy this too because of his strong performance and ice cold law skills, it seriously feels like he doesn't care about being there at times, but then does really well, see for yourself.",The Lincoln Lawyer

In comes hard working Mickey Haller who mainly does business out of his Lincoln Town Car and ends up defending him.

It was a good ride and kept your attention, as Mac had his best role since his 2005 pairing with the great Al Pacino, as he has to be cast into ""presence"" roles to be really effective. Just as John Wayne and Charles Brosnan were cast, as movie ""acting"" is much more personal presence and charisma than classical acting for the stage. Mac knows his strong presence and does well with his limited talent, and he is very effective in the right parts, as in this film where cool and slick prevailed. He can do so well his fake warmth, soft voice, but ice cold face of threat that only some can do right. As has been said, if you got it, flaunt it, and he does that. He is limited in many nuances of acting ability, but he does do some things really well that many more esteemed actors cannot do well at all. That false warmth, soft voice, ice cold threatening face is his best one, IMO.Tex did a good one for a change.

Because this is the film that did it for him, and I'm thrilled to see it was a strong start for him.The Lincoln Lawyer is a magnificent moral film, with enough mindgames, suspense and deceit to more than make up for its unremarkable court room scenes. John Romano's screenplay is full of depth and unfolds so beautifully that I couldn't fault a single turn. Brad Furman's direction is very skilled - the last twenty minutes of the film are flawless and so full of tension I was on the edge of my seat. The whole film looks beautiful, with gorgeous cinematography and production design all around.There's nothing to say about McConaughey other than this was a remarkable turn for him (digging his A Time to Kill drama-legal chops out from under his piles of romcom money). The rest of the cast is also excellent - though the film wastes Bryan Cranston - featuring gorgeous performances from Ryan Phillipe, Marisa Tomei, William H. Macey and Michael Pena. Michael Pena confirms his status as one of the most underrated actors in the profession with just a two scene turn as a man who pleaded guilty to a crime just to avoid the death penalty, despite professing his innocence. The way in which Furman juxtaposed Martinez's first scene, where he's almost howling in fear whilst a cool Haller tries to stay detached, with the second, where a shaved and icy Martinez deflects a noticeably upset Haller's attempts to finally hear his story, is truly masterful. Tomei and McConaghey have great chemistry - to the extent that their divorce stops being believable at times, but the script puts just enough conflict there to stop it being an afterthought.I have to dedicate time just to talk about Ryan Philippe in particular. Whatever he is up to in the script he plays convincingly. A wrongly accused rich kid? A desperate son? Or perhaps a cold-blooded serial killer hiding behind the mask of his polite plea for freedom. Phillipe plays them all with incredible conviction, but there is such fluidity to his performance that it doesn't feel clunky or forced. He began to scare me simply by his appearance on the screen. An incredible, Oscar-worthy performance by Phillipe, which makes me sad that this film never got the attentions of the Academy. I can guarantee that there were a few films that year that could have sat out in categories for this film. Alexander Payne could've sat out for Furman, and Max von Sydow for Phillipe. The Ides of March could've missed out for the screenplay here. The Lincoln Lawyer is technically a legal drama, but the courtroom is just a place for this suspenseful, well-acted moral play to unfold. Its the left bookend for a long McConassance, and that should be reason enough to see it.",The Lincoln Lawyer
95,badajoz-1,Pretty average,5,22 March 2011,"Another popular book from a popular author that's been shoehorned into less than two hours, when it probably needs a TV mini series of at least twice as long. A legal thriller that relies on some technical minutiae for its plotting and twists, that simply is not engrossing enough to work well enough. The main character (Matthew McConaughey) is a slick willie defence lawyer who can cut a deal and works from the back of a Lincoln. He has baggage with a daughter by a prosecuting counsel (Marisa Tomei) and some shady clients. Handed a big money case to defend Hollywood realtor (Ryan Phillippe) he scents the blood of the opposition slowie counsel(Josh Lucas). But if you have seen the trailer you know who the real villain is, and it is confirmed halfway through the film in very downbeat fashion. The thriller (if you can call it that) is then how the hero outwits his defendant without compromising legal rules for counsels. Not very enthralling, especially as we have to put up with a very unconvincing on/off relationship between hero and Tomei (including a perfunctory sex scene) for a lot of screen time, when the most interesting part of the whole thing is the battle of wits and manipulation between McConaughey and Phillippe. Sometimes their scenes crackle and the acting is good, but too often the writing and book plot line drag us away from good cinema. The ending(s) are silly, and protracted, as you will have lost interest by then. Best selling legal thrillers do not often make great cinema, unless the action is firmly centred and anchored.

97,digdog-785-717538,Nice film that's not for everyone,6,22 April 2011,"Generally, when i review a title my arrogance forces me to believe that my opinion will be shared by everyone else who watches that film, but The Lincoln lawyer will be an exception to the rule; some will like it, some will not, and some like me will have seen it all before, and by that i don't mean the script, but the acting. Yep, what does a Hollywood actor do when he has a redundant script to work with? Exactly what you expect them to do, and every scene in this film after the first ten minutes is sadly acted out exactly as you would imagine it would be.Let me walk you through this masterpiece. The Lincoln Lawyer opens as a fast-paced comedy film - these ten minutes are what makes up 99% of what you see in the TV commercials - setting the character of Mick Haller, brilliant and ruthless defence lawyer, then the plot begins. A young man (Ryan Philippe) is accused of assault on a hooker, played as if its a setup by the pimp; now, if you see this movie and actually think he is innocent, congratulations, you will enjoy The Lincoln Lawyer and also congratulations, you have watched considerably less films that your allowed number for a lifetime. Act two, the lawyer finds out the kid is actually guilty (surprise!); a supporting character even utters the truly redundant line ""you can't turn him in and you can't get him off - what are you going to do?"", and veritably enough, the film has to go with the third option - with the main character going from lawyer to punisher.OK, so The Lincoln Lawyer is not a bad film and the whole shebang is done pretty well, yet with hardly anything memorable in it, and if you have never seen anything like - or exactly like - it before, you will enjoy it; on the other hand, if you haven't been living under a rock you'll probably be watching an over-engineered remake of a dozen films before, and it'l make you very bored very quickly.Due to good quality production and discretely good direction, good acting and a nice supporting cast(Ryan Philippe being absolutely horrid and unconvincing), i give the Lincoln Lawyer a minimum vote of 6/10 - feel free to add up to two points if you'r new to the courtroom mystery drama genre.Final vote 6/10",The Lincoln Lawyer
98,Hallelujah289,"Excellent score, great supporting cast, predictable but satisfying ending",9,5 December 2019,"*slight spoilers ahead*First of all, love the score for this film. Some blues and hip hop set to a California cityscape (mention of Inglewood!). Grabbed me from the start with ""Ain't No Love in the Heart of the City"" by Bobby ""Blue"" Band.I watched this film while doing other stuff and it kept grabbing me back until I was watching it only. Really like Matthew McConaughey in this role as well as much of the supporting cast, from an actress you'll recognize as Rose's mom (Francess Fisher) in ""Titanic"" and then Marissa Tomei and others. Whoever did casting did a fantastic job, from Fisher's steely gaze to Tomei's natural warmth.Matthew McConaughey had another role as a defense lawyer in the movie adaptation of John Grisham's ""A Time to Kill"" (1996). In that film McConaughey defended a man (Samuel L. Jackson) who had killed two men who had raped his daughter. That film dealt with themes of justice for the guilty, and this one deals with injustice for the innocent, except in a totally indirect way. What it is more about, really, is a psycho client who wants to do the most damage he can while getting off scot free.What's interesting here is the psycho client is a pretty boy, pretty much, and always looks like he's going to cry. This isn't your typical movie villain mastermind. McConaughey's lawyer character on the other hand is brilliant and hard nosed and confrontational when he needs to be. The fight isn't exactly fair, and makes for an expected but still complete and creatively satisfying ending, even if it feels like a novella.I suggest watching both of McConaughey's films and seeing how they compare. Whether very similar or not, they both deal with gray areas. McConaughey gets a guilty man off both times, but one deserves it while the other doesn't. Defense lawyers don't get a good rep, but watching these two films you might get a sense of why they're necessary and why they do what they do.",The Lincoln Lawyer
99,virindra,Don't judge a movie by it's cover.,7,8 October 2011,"The Licoln Lawyer is a good movie, with a boring cover. The cover is the reason for people not the rent this movie. I almost did not see this movie either.The movie was not very good. It begins with the overconfident lawyer, played by Mathew. It almost made me sick. He's been driven in this Lincoln car (that should explain the Lincoln lawyer?) and he makes a lot of money as a lawyer. I liked William H. Macey as his college. He had a nice appearance.When you're watching this movie, it's like watching fracture. Ryan Phillippe would not get a small role in a movie, so you know he should be guilty. And then the rest of the movie might me interesting and exciting, but at the end it goes the way it only has to go; towards a happy end what is, in this case, not very realistic.",The Lincoln Lawyer
100,Ric-7,Contemporary Justice,8,22 March 2011,"The film begins with several instances of McConaughey's character Mick engaging in dishonesty for his own benefit. So it should not be surprising that Mick violates countless ethical rules and probably some criminal laws on his way to the climax of the film. The film's point of view about the justice system is extremely cynical: the detectives don't hesitate to invent evidence and cut corners to convict someone they believe is guilty, and the plot matches this dishonesty with Mick on his way to seeing that the guilty are convicted. The point of criminal justice is that the jury should decide, and not the investigators or attorneys.However, if you approach the film by getting past the obvious fact that this could never happen, I think you can enjoy it on its own terms. This is not a crime mystery (the mystery does not last long), and it is not really a courtroom drama because the courtroom scenes last perhaps 15 minutes maximum. But the film creates some very interesting dilemmas on its way to the ultimate ""just"" and very ironic resolution.The acting was uniformly excellent. It is so refreshing to see a Matthew McConaughey film that relies upon his acting rather than his physique. I also found it interesting that McConaughey's opponent in the court room was Josh Lucas, another actor who in years past has been more relied on for his looks rather than his acting: check out ""Sweet Home Alabama"" for wretched example. Here he did a fine job.But the excellent acting even extended to the bit players: all were convincing. I also loved Trace Adkins' bit as a biker. I totally enjoyed the film.

Veteran character actors William H. Macy and John Leguizamo add class and excitement with excellent portrayals of the investigator and the referring attorney. The remaining cast rises to their level, so we have a cast of professionals giving us a polished and entertaining production. The fact that two of the most beautiful ladies in film are included doesn't hurt. Marisa Tomei manages to keep her clothing on (unlike The Wrestler) in spite of a torrid love scene with McConaughey. And the absolutely beautiful Frances Fisher is incredible as the domineering mother of the accused who is footing the bill through her son. Kudos to Trace Adkins for a small but well done performance as the leader of the motorcycle gang who has Haller on retainer. (I guess no one is satisfied with just being an excellent singer and performer anymore.) Overall, the film is fast paced, well edited, and entertaining, exactly what a good movie should be. Rated R for violence, sexual innuendo, and language, this one is for the older teens and the adults. Too much explaining for the rug rats. Collectible?

Defending low life criminals who cannot afford good attorneys, Mickey usually works his cases on the backseat of his Lincoln. With a broken marriage and a cute daughter and a still friendly x wife in his life Mickey somehow keeps his head above the water when the tides are high. But when this new high price deal comes his way unexpectedly and a rich family boy and his mother is involved in it Mickey sets to sail the deep water. But soon he realizes that he is becoming a pawn in a wicked game which he cannot simply quit even though his life is at stake.Lincoln Lawyer is a crime thriller with a twist of legal background to it. The story is fast phased and gives little details to hang in to most of the time. It has flashbacks of events which occur earlier and assumptions which is normal to crime scene story telling. Yet as the main lead is an attorney than a police investigator makes this twist a bit uniquely.The plot doesn't make a great deal of sense but it sure can hook you up for good two hours. When the story starts like a normal drama that features a twisted attorney in the middle it gradually evolves in to a thriller with quite a bit of blood and gore. Like I said before it can make you wonder throughout the plot of what's to come next.Good performance by the feel free Matthew McConaughey and more than good performance by Ryan Philippe.

108,troy-manatunga,A Must Watch,8,9 June 2011,"It never was a directorial marvel. Sometimes the more mature themes require the simplest of direction. It takes some maturity in a director, to take the back seat in a movie and ensure the basics are given justice. Brad Furman who is quite fresh on the directors' seat does just this. He ensures that the emphasis stays on the fundamental realism. There is focus on relationships, the justice system, human error, innocence and conviction of the wrong. Each aspect has been heavily concentrated on and worked into immaculate perfection. All you readers have for sure heard of the movie title, but not many of us did bother to go to the movies to see it. As always some of the most delicate themes do not draw attention unlike fantasy thrillers or hard core marvel action movies. However some of the greatest movies have always gone down pretty silent. ""The Lincoln Lawyer"" is 100% a must watch movie for all of you who value inspiration. Myself included we sometimes stray away from doing what is right just to meet ends, however sometimes it's mandatory that we stop and take a look and correct things if possible. Mick Haller (Matthew McConaughey) a lawyer who is really great at what he does is very devious. He knows his territory and he knows his principles however his values are not 100% honest. He represents those who are pretty good at being bad. A case from a Beverly Hills playboy Louis Roulet (Ryan Phillippe) comes as an eye opener for some deeds that he is not very happy about in his past. In a tactful approach to correct the situation Mick has to play it smarter than those who are playing him. Apart from Ryan Phillippe I felt the acting was very much convincing. Ryan Phillippe who is a very talented young actor could have been more convincing. I would have preferred James Franco instead, but well I am sure they had their reasons for it. Matthew McConaughey is nothing less than fantastic. I myself was almost convinced of taking up law when I witnessed how cool he was in being a lawyer. There are those who work off a desk, there are those who work at home, but this guy works out of his car and convinces the audience that is THE way to roll. The Lincoln personifies his character as being one of a kind and it brings him more into the light. Smartly done by the Brad Furman with the inclusion of an iconic car as the Lincoln! Josh Lucas & William Macy both well-seasoned stars were spot on and just gave the touch the movie needed. ""The Lincoln Lawyer"" is not at the movies anymore however it is highly unlikely to be one that one would chose over ""Fast 5"" at the movies. Yet, it's a must watch production. It's the ""Lord of War"" of today for me.",The Lincoln Lawyer

It either had a limited release or the publicity department really dropped the ball. I found it to be an entertaining, faithful interpretation of the book, and am sorry for everyone involved in its creation that it seems to have dropped out of sight immediately after having been released. Mr. McConaughey does a very serviceable job in the role of the protagonist, and the supporting cast is truly outstanding. Before renting the film it had been a year or so since I'd read the book, so it was nice to see a story which was familiar, but for which I didn't remember every twist. I intend to see it again.",The Lincoln Lawyer
110,cashbacher,A tough lawyer has to navigate a figurative minefield,10,27 December 2019,"This is a movie where the violent undertones are overwhelmed by the drama of the interaction of the characters. Matthew McConaughey plays attorney Mickey Haller, a man that represents people that are often guilty of horrendous crimes. He plays the legal game hard and has been very successful, results that have earned him the enmity of members of the law enforcement community. Much of his work is conducted in the back seat of his chauffeur-driven Lincoln car, hence the title of the movie.
Haller is hired to defend the son of a wealthy female L. A. area realtor from charges of beating up and threatening to kill a prostitute. Shortly into the case he flags inconsistencies in the story of the defendant, and he notices many similarities between this case and one he had many years ago. In the earlier case, even though his client vehemently claimed his innocence, the best he thought he could do was get the murder charge reduced from the death penalty to life in prison with the possibility of parole.
As the story threads wind and twist, the reader is left guessing, but it soon becomes clear that something is amiss. Even though Haller begins to doubt his role in the case, he soldiers on, providing a strong defense of his client. Despite this, he begins to construct a complementary thread of a case that will hopefully insulate him from what is clearly a potential for retribution by the evil players in the case.
William H. Macy plays a strong supporting role as Haller's investigator, his facial and long head of hair make him look like anything but a smart and effective investigator that knows how to play the system on the edge of legality. Bryan Cranston plays Detective Lankford, a man nearing retirement that openly expresses his disgust with Haller. Marisa Tomei plays prosecutor Maggie McPherson, Haller's ex-wife that he fathered a daughter with. It is clear that there is still much between them and both are devoted to their daughter.
Haller faces many obstacles in his quest to be a lawyer for a man he despises and revisit the past case to do what he can to make it right. There is a climactic scene where nearly everything is revealed, and Haller learns that there is more evil afoot than he thought. It is a great movie where the twists keep moving with uncertainty regarding the innocent and guilty.",The Lincoln Lawyer

Macy, Josh Lucas, John Leguizamo, Michael Peña, Josh Lucas, Bryan Cranston, Trace Adkins, Katherine Moennig ... and on and on.I highlight the cast in this way at the beginning because it was the sole reason I chose to attend the screening. The only other possible reason could have been the story and, to me, thinking of a lawyer in any sort of leading role - let alone a possibly heroic one - is stretching my ability to suspend disbelief just a bit too far.The cast did a marvelous job and I really wanted to like the film. In fact, I did like it. But I also had a nagging suspicion that it was somehow unsatisfying. I began to wonder why and the trouble was I began wondering during the film. So, let's consider the cast. Matthew McConaughey did a stand-up job with the lead character, imbuing him with just the right touch of slimy, smarmy, lawyerly stereotype. He's the kind of legal type we all love to hate. The sort who open the jail house doors to rapists, murders and child molesters. The rest of the cast treats this sterling character appropriately.During McConaughey's journey he manages to wrap his arms around the incredibly lovely and endlessly talented Marisa Tomei. Seeing her in his arms is yet another reason for me to dislike his character. How such a miscreant could ever attract such loveliness is beyond me. But Ms. Tomei saves me from my jealous rage with her great beauty and that certain other indescribably illusive quality that makes a man longingly wish to look into the depth of those eyes and smell her breath playing across his cheek in the dark. Her's is beauty you could eat with a spoon. Whatever comes out of her mouth is a etude for the heart.Mr. Phillippe is surprisingly good as the intended villain. When he reveals the depth of his wickedness it could actually make a chill down your spine. His portrayal is bolstered by the sure and certain knowledge that people like that actually walk the streets and actually do evade incarceration.William H. Macy is his usual superb character. He always inhabits his roles so well we can completely buy his portrayals of the wide spectrum he's covered in his busy career.The film is carried in quite a few spots by the bright sparks from the likes of John Leguizamo, Michael Peña and Trace Adkins. They make the film much better than it would have been otherwise.The rest of this truly excellent cast comes in and out of the story creating their little worlds as they pass through it; Lucas,Cranston, Moenning all fit well in their roles.With so much talent doing such good work, then why the less than fulfilling feeling? I can sum it up in one way by saying that it's likely because the story wasn't really any better than an episode of an old Perry Mason television show; nothing really new. Perhaps that's as far as you can go in trying to make a lawyer look interesting in any way.Additionally, just when you think the story might take a truly interesting turn, it plods along in mediocrity. It could have found some truly interesting elements if it were more an Oedipal tale. It certainly looked like it might have been on the surface. So once again film makers fire a near miss. Go see the film and enjoy the separate parts, the acting is truly worth it. But just don't expect anything wonderful. In the end it's just, but is entertainment.By Bruce L.

118,thewillt08,McConaughey Deliverers as Best he Could,6,31 August 2013,"Lawyers are people who work their way around the law to prevent people from going to jail or get a sentence reduced as much as possible. In my opinion lawyers do their job for the greater good and as some of them may be greedy and corrupt, most of them do want what is best for their clients. Now, I have no idea why this movie is called The Lincoln Lawyer. Matthew McConaughey plays one of these layers and in the beginning he seems like a crooked lawyer who cheats the system so it seemed like he was going to be a bad guy but a firm twist right in the middle of the movie changes the story of the movie completely. McConaughey brings his talents to this movie and for the most part he does a very good job. The audience feels for him as he struggles his way from scene to scene. The start of the movie is great but it is also something that has been done time and time again. Mick Haller is a lawyer who is hired by a young man who is accused of rape. The buildup is a basic solve-the-case type of movie but a secret discovered changed the case completely and suddenly Haller finds himself trapped in a corner as his case also ties into a previous case he has guilt for. William H. Macy has a supporting role as well and he is fantastic as always. I really liked the beginning of this movie. As simple as it was the premise worked. I liked how Haller would make shady deals with the bikers and how he made his environment a product of him. He seemed to be in control of his life and the way McConaughey carried himself was commendable. He has this swagger on him and the way he acts this character out was great. His performance was great from beginning to end but the twist in the middle of the movie is where it lost me.I won't give away the big twist that comes about an hour into the movie, but it was very risky. I give the movie credit for going down this road and if somebody says they loved the movie and the twist, I wouldn't argue with them. I can understand why people would like the twist but I also see why people like me wouldn't. It wasn't so much the twist that bothered me; it was more of the placement. This would have been a game changer if it came at the end and it was a race to the finish. Instead everything is out on the table and the movie progresses and the focus is the irony of the situation and the situation Haller is in. William H. Macy is a phenomenal actor and is good in almost every role he is in. I can forgive him for Jurassic Park 3 but other than that he is awesome. I feel his performances are underrated and he deserves more credit. I wish he was in this movie more and again, his endgame wasn't disappointing, but the placement wasn't right. He steals the show in every scene and is a perfect supporting role for this movie. The case itself is fish from the beginning. Most of the plot twists are surprising but I saw one in the end coming a mile away. I had no idea how the case would play out or how Haller would solve it so I was invested in the entire movie. Other than the case there really isn't much going on. The case was obviously the main focus but backstory and other minor plot lines are important. I loved the tie in with an old case as Haller's demons. If I remember correctly he has a family but it really isn't important. There are a fair amount of loose ends for lack of a better word. The story wraps up and ends but there are little story lines that go nowhere. Bryan Cranston is in the movie. I don't know why. I don't remember why. I saw this movie not too long ago and I forgot most of what happened. Overall, The Lincoln Lawyer is a decent movie. I didn't love it as I wish it was a tad different but I give the movie credit for doing what it did. I saw this on Netflix and I don't regret it. I would probably watch it again if a friend wanted to and I had nothing else better to do. I wouldn't but this on blu ray but it is worth seeing. If you are into pirating movies then go for it, but when you get caught don't say I told you to. The Lincoln Layer isn't a disaster its plain average.

The characters are all very well portrayed without being over the top. What I liked the most about this film is that it feels 'real'...it puts you in the courtroom and outside of it like you were standing there next to the characters. Matthew McConaughey and Ryan Phillippe were both standouts and gave very real performances.You really need to pay attention to every minor character and subplot (especially during the first hour) because much of it ties together.

The cast is unbelievable and things started well, but took a boring and predictable nosedive fast. You don't give a novice director talent to waste like this! The first 20 minutes looked great. Then a story had to be woven. William H Macy and Bryan Cranston in one movie together? Both of these great actors used about 10% of their potential. That is movie sin. Then the lame camera work. What kind of amateur director does a 360 shot in a courtroom for dramatic appeal? The flashback scenes were horrible. This is a perfect example of how TV dramas on cable make motion pictures look like B movies. Even on a TV show having a biker gang appear out of nowhere would lose the intelligence of an audience.

121,montera_iulian,Matthew McConaughey single-handedly carries with decency one of the best B movies of the last years,7,3 May 2011,"Directed by Brad Furman, The Lincoln Lawyer is a surprisingly good courthouse drama supported by a strong cast and a decent story. It depicts the process of a charismatic lawyer Mickey Haller (Matthew McConaughey) who gets inside a case which doesn't revolve only around his defender. He's an iconic lawyer in Los Angeles dealing with various criminals and who holds connection within the city's underworld. He finds himself in a big trouble once he takes charge in defending Louis Roulet (Ryan Phillippe), a Beverly-Hills hot-shot who's accused of rape and attempted murder. The story becomes predictable in time but at the same time it departs itself from other identical formulas by not using clichés and stereotypes. Therefore the movie's quality is raised to good entertainment thanks to the diversity of the plot structure. The characters feel real, we support our main protagonist and we get more than just an idea of who Haller really is thanks to the shown flashbacks, the mistakes he did, the people he helped, the marriage he had with his ex-wife who was a prosecutor Maggie McPherson (Marisa Tomei) and even his own driver. All these details add up a lot to the building of his persona. This film avoids with decency the crap surrounding the film industry and it honestly is one of the best B movies I have seen in the last couple of years. I'm saying B movie because it still has it's little flaws in direction, the story even though it was good it could have been approached in a different way and the ending could have been a lot more satisfying.However, I will add that the cast did a great job. Marisa Tomei was beautiful to watch like always even though she had little time on screen, Michael Pena, William H. Macy and Josh Lucas all did a decent job and even Ryan Phillippe who I personally dislike as an actor I found him to be not annoying at all. The most impressive thing to me was by far Matthew's work. He really showed that he has the talent to do a lot more on the screen and he should really focus on doing more movies at least like this one if not better simply because him walking around and goofing and approaching ladies on screen in a foolish way it's really old news to pretty much everyone. Thumbs up, as the bloggers or youtubers say to Matthew McConaughey because he made me care about his next movie.As far as the direction, like I said, there are few flaws and things that I didn't liked. The contrast, the editing at times was a little bit messed up but I really enjoyed some of the songs used because they matched the specific scenes but other than that everything could have been much better. In the end, I think everyone should have a good time watching this movie, it will not give you any headaches, you will not see Matther taking his shirt off (well, he takes it half-off in one shot but it's dark in the room so that doesn't count ladies) and overall you won't feel you're watching a movie you have seen before even if you actually did.",The Lincoln Lawyer
122,byrann_gowan,What would you do if it seemed like the person you were defending was guilty?,8,23 August 2018,"That is the question that this movie asks. Whether or not it was the case in which you're currently in or a previous case, what would you do if the person you were defending was guilty of a crime? Would you continue doing your job or would you fight for justice to be served?In this movie, Matthew McConaughey portrays Mick Haller, a defense attorney whose office is in his Lincoln (hence the title of the film). When a Realtor is accused of beating up a prostitute, Haller is called in to defend him. However, as the case goes on, Haller finds that this case has a lot of similarities to a previous case of his, and he realizes that his client might not be quite as innocent as he portrays.Overall, a great movie, perhaps the one that brought in the McConaissance. Before this movie, McConaughey was known as the dude on the beach in all those romantic comedies; nowadays, you'll find him more in dramas and doing a stand-up job in them. This one is no different; he portrays a man who defends the scum of the earth, yet when this client comes around, he starts to realize just how far he can take the filth of his clients. Ryan Phillipe is also great as the client that may or may not be hiding more than what he's saying. The supporting cast - which includes Oscar winner Marisa Tomei, Oscar nominee William H. Macy, Oscar nominee Bryan Cranston, John Leguizamo, Josh Lucas and Trace Adkins - all do a fine job in helping the movie move along.My one complaint about the movie was that I felt it kind of went a bit too long.

123,jnguyen46117,The Lincoln Lawyer: 8/10,8,13 May 2011,"Perhaps people will view Matthew McConaughey, who has a handful of bad movies on his resume, differently after seeing The Lincoln Lawyer. His performance did not carry the whole movie, but it certainly helped the film's predictable premise: a lawyer who deals with small criminals on a daily basis for money, but after running into a high profile client, Mick Haller's life was turned upside down. The contents are formulaic: lawyer represented client for assault, got him out, and got him back in jail for murder. It may be entertaining to read but it is really repetitive if you see over and over again. We'd seen this many times on TV, but The Lincoln Lawyer extended to a movie thanks to the writer, John Romano. Written with a lovely balance of courtroom drama and the characters themselves, the script is the film's greatest strength. Although, I found myself thinking at times that the film is a little messy with the plot.And maybe another strength of the film is the quirky camera angles of newcomer director Brad Furman. And let's not forget why Hollywood will not treat Matthew McConaughey the same after this film.

124,palacerevolution2000,M McM at his finest,7,3 May 2020,"It's Matthew doing what he does so well: uber-slick and confident, up to James Bond levels. And he does this while remaining immensely likable. I thought the cast, and his whole posse was extremely well chosen. This had sequels written all over it. Maybe McM just got too big, and did not want to get attached to a franchise lawyer series. The plot is almost secondary for the film. It's his show all the way. The one major flaw I have to say is the ever wooden Ryan Phillipe. Have never seen a film with him where I've liked him,. rooted for him; or just appreciated his acting. Which is pretty much non existent. But Earl, the chauffeur, DJ Corliss, the snitch, Leguizamo, the bonds man, the bikers, and Marisa all were stellar.

125,jsaus63304,Good adaptation of the book,8,3 December 2011,"First of all, I would recommend that you read the book before you watch the movie. While they have done a good job of condensing a book into a 2 hour movie, some things go by very quickly and would be easy to miss. Casting for the most part was spot on and quite like you would have envisioned from reading the book.I have not been a fan of Matthew McConaughey or his work but he does a good job in this roll. While the part of Louis Roulet starts of just as described in the book, he does not seem to evolve as sinister as the character becomes in the book. At least the movie follows the plot in the book quite well and hits most of the key points, unlike the adaptation of ""Blood Work"" also by Michael Connelly where they decided to make the killer a different character than in the book.Like I said, good movie, good plot and decent adaption but if you do not read the book, you may have to watch the movie two or three times to catch all the fine points. It would be all too easy to be watching and say ""What happened and how did we get to that?"". You really do have to pay attention.With all the mindless action movies with special effects and no story line, it is refreshing to watch a movie that has a plot and good acting and does not have to depend on explosions, gun fights and car chases to keep your attention.",The Lincoln Lawyer

128,TamPalm,This movie made me smile,7,31 March 2011,"I walked out of the theater after seeing this movie with a big ol grin on my face. I just couldn't help but smiling. It's been a while since I had a memorable movie-watching experience, so I guess my heart was just singing a little bit.Very solid movie. First the cast: Matthew Mc was born to play the lawyer. His portrayal here rivals or even surpasses ""A Time to Kill."" He definitely has the goods to carry a quality movie: swagger emitting out of his pores, attractive visage, charming personality, you name it. His co-stars here are all very complimentary as well. Seeing Marisa Tomei age so much about the eyes kind-of takes you aback for a minute, but eventually you allow her to be this character. Ryan Phillipe is now type-cast in my book: he loves the cute, articluate, but freaky and disturbing characters, doesn't he? So in that sense, this was not a stretch for him...but he pulled the role off nonetheless. It was very easy to hate him. Sprinkle a relatively short but meaty role from William Macy (who apparently did this role while still shooting for ""Shameless"" as he sported the same long, messy mane as on that show), add some cuddly criminals to the mix, and you have a solid cast. The only thing that kind-of irritated me was the ""yessa boss"" lingo of the lawyer's driver. I guess it was supposed to be a cutesy touch, but it never grew on me. Too much a reminder of those turbulent racist years of yesteryear. I could have done without the reminders personally. But this is only a minor gripe in the grand scheme of things.I read someone state the plot may be too legal-ly for some viewers. I didn't find it too much in the weeds at all. I've seen overly-involved plots that leave the viewer behind before, this was not one of those. This plot was clever and a little predictable, but you appreciate how it allows you to follow along while still making you feel somewhat intelligent in the process. In this sense, the writing is admirable.Finally, the music. Funky, modern, inspiring. I thought it added a welcome ""cool"" touch to the experience. It kept things hip enough for younger audiences, while not being overly offensive for older ones. In fact, that pretty much describes the movie overall. You appreciate how it doesn't indulge in seediness. Save a little bit of a gratuitous lovemaking scene and possibly offensive language to those living alternative lifestyles, this movie is general audience-friendly. (Take note Hollywood, it doesn't take all the dirty-ness to make a quality film that can rake in the bucks.) 8/10 for the Lincoln Lawyer",The Lincoln Lawyer

Somehow, the combination of good acting, good production, and good writing just don't add up to a movie I could stay interested in.

Thinking it over, McConnaughy as Haller is a more compelling character still, probably because of McConnaughy's ability to manage complexity, plus his subtlety and sense of timing. I just ran a search for ""Lincoln Lawyer 2,"" and, indeed, a project is planned, though it's not fleshed out with details. This is a universe I can easily inhabit (in fact, Bosch and Haller occupy the same fictional universe, both living in the hills overlooking LA --- Haller has told Bosch in a Bosch novel that he was played by McConnaughy in a film, this gets and stays recursive!). Honestly, Haller seems for real, as do the other characters. One mark of a film I enjoy is that it stays with me afterwards. That is very much the case for Lincoln Lawyer. In fact, I'm not a huge fan of crime dramas, but stories like this certainly break all my rules. Among the best crime stories I have seen, and it certainly left me wanting more!",The Lincoln Lawyer

Mathew McConaughey shows a range of emotions and a lot of energy with his portrayal and comes against with many moral issues. The movie is fast-paced and the dialogue is smart and witty. Every piece of the puzzle comes together nicely in the end and the courtroom scenes are the highlight of the film. Marissa Tomei as the charming and sweet wife and Ryan Phillipe as the cynical rich boy who is accused of beating up a prostitute stand out from the rest of the cast.
CONS:The biggest problem of the film is the direction. The fast camera movements and the sudden closeups cause irritation. Moreover, the psychological idiosyncracy of the villain could be explored further and the multiple endings are less smarter than really want to be.",The Lincoln Lawyer

134,MosHr,Like an episode of a TV legal drama,6,17 March 2011,"The plot is predictable but worse than that it envelops itself in the TV legal drama atmosphere. The courtroom scenes are just so clichéd and the flashbacks, recreations are right out of every crime detective TV show. Furthermore, the movie doesn't ascribe to grandeur or any sort of life changing event. It's the usual everything was as it was when the show started framework that TV shows do.One thing it is ramped up on is eye candy; the women are gorgeous - Mick's wife, her associate and even the janitor are gorgeous and the prostitutes are also very pleasing to the eye. I suppose Matthew McConaughey and Ryan Phillippe also make great eye candy for the ladies. The black 80s Lincoln continental is a good looking car - though I would imagine quite impractical for a variety of reasons.Overall, it's a tad disappointing a movie but good entertainment. It just seems to lack gravity and urgency at most times in the storyline but the charisma of the cast do make up for quite a bit of it.",The Lincoln Lawyer

I rather enjoy Matt M. movies yet this was the first one I had seen where he had a more serious role (most of the movies I've seen with him are either chick flicks or Dazed and Confused) and I thought he did an excellent job acting. The movie itself was filled with some nice plot twists that nobody really saw coming, which is pretty hard to do nowadays, and I was entertained from start to finish.

I thought it was written well and crafted nicely, with many twists and turns along the way.Matthew McConaughey did an excellent job playing charismatic lawyer Mick Haller. He played the part smoothly and made him likable. Haller represents wealthy client Louis Roulet (Ryan Philippe) but isn't as honest with Haller as he seems. Haller notices some similarities between Roulet's and a previous case and realizes they're connected. Philippe is quite impressive here and does a great job shaping into a psychopath over time. The rest of the supporting cast were good such as Tomei (Maggie McPherson) and William H. Macy (Frank Levin).I liked the story and pacing. It kept me invested throughout, especially with the number of surprises. I kept wondering how Mick was going to outsmart Roulet and bring him down.

Bradley Cooper should have been cast in this role. This is the third time McConaughey played an attorney. Marisa Tomei and Ryan Phillipe carried this film.This truly shows how the rich can get away with murder, or any crimes. The storyline was quite enjoyable and interesting.

139,zevt,Plot Holes,5,22 April 2017,"The good: This old-school courtroom thriller has good casting and acting, and features a fast-moving plot that keeps you on your toes. It also features Marisa Tomei who is as lovely as always.The screenplay, however, is one of those times when the writers try too hard to be clever beyond their grasp of the plot, and end up shooting themselves in the foot and contradicting themselves..*spoilers*The biggest problem is with Roulet's plan. At first he lies so well that he even has McConaughey believing him. And since he is a well known talented lawyer, and now he has him on his side, that should be enough to win. In fact, he could have hired any lawyer with his money and convinced him the same way. Except for some reason this isn't enough and it suddenly turns out that he asked for McConaughey because it would conflict with a previous case where he put an innocent man in jail.So what is the plan exactly? To have McConaughey afraid of revealing his mistake in public? Nothing would have happened! Everyone made the same mistake including the judge. In fact, he may just be the type of person who would want very much to correct this mistake, thus choosing him as his lawyer as part of his strategy makes no sense.In addition, if he hadn't hired him, nobody would have made the connection between the two murders in the first place.And then he goes and kills McConaughey's friend and sets him up for blackmail. Besides this being already two plans too many, once again, why not blackmail any other lawyer that wouldn't have been able to connect the cases in the first place? And to really finish himself off, he made it personal by killing McConaughey's friend when he could have framed any old murder in the same way. Would you hire a lawyer to defend you from the death penalty after killing his friend? Obviously he can do any of 500 things to sabotage the case, which is exactly what he did.And then they just couldn't resist adding a completely random twist where the murderer turns out to be someone else for no particular reason, thus undermining plausibility just to keep the twists coming.There are more plot holes, but this is quite enough for now.So, again, a case of hacks trying to be clever and biting off way more than they can chew.",The Lincoln Lawyer
140,andy-933-696608,The Lincoln Lawyer Review,7,19 March 2011,"Whether you are truly innocent or guilty, this legal system is only looking for the facts to end the matter. A jury can look at a complete white trash defendant, judge him by his clothes, his dialogue, and furthermore the way they look in their eyes. Whether he is a good person or not doesn't matter. The very first impression those people get, is all they need to bury him. Jesus Martinez (Pena) probably felt that kind of injustice, as his Attorney Mick Haller (McConaughey) told him to plead guilty in order to avoid the needle. Understandable, but demeaning enough to go against what he knew. ""I'm Innocent Man. I ain't going to Jail. I ain't't putting my mom through that"", is what Jesus said, feeling hope slip away from him, as the one man he believed could help him, told him to surrender his pride towards the truth. Defense Attorney Mickey Haller has often defended the less than prominent clients, the kind society will immediately judge as the obviously guilty. From motorcycle gangs, to a coke snorting addict, Haller's philosophy towards defending innocent clients as an even worse feeling of inner shame brings him to what some might say his most difficult, and terrifying client yet. Louis Roulet (Phillipe), a playboy with enough money to back his name, has been charged with the sexual assault of a prostitute, thus placing him in Mick's hands. What started as one night of paid pleasure, turned into a night of sexual abuse, confusion, and constant questioning. The way Louis tells it, he was struck in the back if his head, and the next thing he knew 2 homo's were holding him down, while the ho herself confessed in sheer panic, seeing him as a meal ticket to make extra cash. Viewers at first are going to be confused by this kid. His very first lines towards his collaborations with Mick reveal a scared kid. The very desperation of the need to prove his innocence, as much as his general obsession to keep the trial legitimate, shows a rational need to prove he's not lying. No settlements, just plain old proof of his innocence. It's hard to see any of the psychotic deviancy that described that girls story, and Mick's investigator Frank (Macy) suspects enough, beyond the parking tickets the kid has managed to score. Mick however focuses on this trial, asking questions of whatever relevance, yet trying to match a fierce prosecutor, Ted Minton (Lucas), and even juggling the very concepts of what he considers to be innocent and guilty from the strained but surprisingly friendly relationship he has with his ex (Tomei), as he learns more than enough about Louis to scare yet, give him the chance of taking the trial into his own hands. It seemed like the bad guy would win, as Haller played the right moves, insuring the freedom of his client. It took a few favors, like recruiting a snitch for the prosecution, and even so much as having that snitch expose himself as a liar. The very calm and patient sophistication of every courtroom scenes is ecstatic. There isn't a whole a lot of screaming. But there's enough tension, and even slick humor among the witnesses. I loved seeing the witnesses attract enough laughs from the audience as they express their own personality into answering the questions, which of course seems dull and repetitive to many witnesses, no matter what the case. I just felt the ecstasy of complete wonder, as I pondered to what Haller's true goal in freeing a man he knew to be a killer. Hell, his motivation to avenge his deceased partner seemed like enough of a motivation. Upon Roulet's freedom, an even bigger charge is dropped, (quite obvious) murder. We all know that wasn't enough to hold him, and we didn't want it to, because watching Mick's biker buddies kick the crap out of his face was more than amusing. His mom, Mary Windsor (Fischer) gave us quite a surprise, as she put a bullet in Haller, and revealing herself to be Frank's true murderer. Well that explains, Louis beating the tracer. Despite the bad luck of being shot, Mick makes it out with his own shot, and even goes back to his office doing what he does back. It's hard to imagine a character like the one McConaughey brings to the courtroom, has so much good in him, despite taking more pleasure of representing the scum of the earth, and not out of that typical lawyer crap. ""Everybody deserves a fair trial"", true, yet annoying words to hear. I can't say I heard Mick recite that once. ""The Lincoln Lawyer"" itself is unique, bringing out a truly thrilling sense of question into the very notion of our justice system. The performances are all incredible, with each character bringing in a charismatic personality, and the scenes in or out of court can really bring out either the tension in the case, or the trauma outside it. That very scene with Michael Pena, as a man convicted of murder, for one of Louis's past assaults, shows such torment, and furthermore a close look in to how much the trust among a Lawyer and his client should stand. Phillipe, as well was excellent, psycho. Matt's performance, as any of his performances, whether in a drama or comedy, shows sophistication, presence, and furthermore a bit of humor, even if dark in this film's case.",The Lincoln Lawyer

It referred to a car ""souped-up"" for racing purposes. In this movie, the car (rather than the lawyer) IS a Lincoln-- but it's the STORY & not the auto that's ""enhanced"" in performance  The lawyer is Mick Haller (MATTHEW McCONAUGHEY), & he operates out of a Lincoln Town Car rather than an office. Usually, he's driven by a street-wise black guy named Earl (LAURENCE MASON)  Matt seems to specialize in representing ""LOW-life"" criminals, &, while the car is black, his favorite color is green-- as in getting his MONEY up-front before he does any work for the accused  As he's about to go into court to represent someone, a bail-bondsman contact, Val Valenzuela (JOHN LEGUIZAMO), clues him in to a possible high-paying new client. That guy is Louis Roulet (RYAN PHILIPPE), who's been accused of beating and an attempted rape of a woman  Ryan is the son of a very rich real estate agent named Mary Windsor (FRANCES FISHER), & he is very adamant in protesting his innocence. In talking to him, Matt brings along his old friend Frank Levin (WILLIAM H. MACY), his longtime investigator  Initially, Ryan appears to BE innocent, since many of the Police Dept's ""facts"" (such as a knife recovered) appeared to exonerate him in the case. Further, the more Matt delves into the facts, the more he discovers ""disconcerting"" things-- like how the woman charging Ryan has a history of involvement in prostitution, & there's the possibility she was trying for a large cash payout from his family  As the story evolves, we learn that Matt's father had also been a lawyer, but that Matt is an ""operator"": Matt has a bunch of ""SLIPPERY"" ways about him, in that he sets-up things like false incidents to cause Ryan's family lawyer to pay him MORE MONEY, & does other ""shady"" things in how he operates  Matt is good at working (taking advantage of) his ""ins"" around the area. One of those is Prosecuter Maggie McPherson (MARISA TOMEI). It turns out, he'd had a DAUGHTER with her in the past, & he's actively involved in helping co-parent the child (who lives with Marisa). He regularly goes to her (& others he knows) to try to get some ""private"" / advance information about cases  Bit-by-bit, we learn that Matt had a history of seeking ""EASY"" ways of handling litigation-- such as trying for ""plea bargains"" & the like to get thru them. For example, rather than looking for facts to prove the innocence of client Jesus Martinez (MICHAEL PENA), he mainly sought out a reduced term that sent Michael to San Quentin prison  But, the more Matt & William investigate Ryan's case, the worse Ryan looks. Despite Ryan's initial protestations, he might have been involved in one or more PREVIOUS attacks. And, since Ryan is ""protected"" by ""attorney-client privilege"" (which keeps facts & communication between them ""private""), that ""limits"" what Matt can do & how he does it  Matt is involved in other cases as he's handling Ryan's matter, & we learn some important particulars from how he manages those. There are some elements that seem to ""impact"" on RYAN'S case The Police (in the form of Detective Lankford, played by BRYAN CRANSTON) start to question Matt regarding a matter involving William, &, more & more, we start to feel that Matt is possibly being ""PLAYED"" by Ryan in his case  Things start to ""twist & turn"" like crazy, with all kinds of ""uncomfortable"" essentials starting to THREATEN Matt & people he cares for Things that seemed to be ""clear"" start becoming ""murky"" at best, & past MURDER cases start to impact everything that's going on with Ryan & Matt  Was Ryan telling the truth that he'd been unfairly charged in his case?... When Matt finds out some ""DISCONCERTING"" facts, will be still be able (or willing) to properly REPRESENT Ryan?... Will possible charges against actions by Matt impact what he's able to do?... Can Matt live with ""himself"" if he's trying to defend someone he feels is really GUILTY of charges?... Will Matt's family be at risk from his efforts to defend certain people charged with crimes?... Can Matt find a way to do what's ""RIGHT"" in a world of ""wrongs""?!... Matt has had a history of playing ""surfer"" type characters & making POOR movies. This film is NOT the Matt you're ""used"" to: he keeps his shirts ON, & provides a really effective dramatic presence-- by far the BEST character & performance he's ever had  The other actors are also very SUCCESSFUL & believable in their roles.

143,DemiRonin,Lincoln Lawyer is clever in some ways but overall not as smoothly put together as Matthew McConaughey's pretty face.,6,16 April 2011,"Mick Haller, played by Matthew McConaughey, is a slick private defense lawyer who works for anyone who can pay the bills including gangsters and hookers. When Val, a bondsman, gives Mick a tip on a potential cash cow of a client Mick eagerly tries to swoon Louis played by Ryan Phillippe, a rich boy accused of assault on a hooker. Mick is a bit of a drunk and is separated from his wife, a city attorney. They also have a young daughter? son? I don't even remember now.... hahaha. Any hoo....Mick gets attached to the case and with his partner/friend Frank they work they work on defending Louis. Things get complicated as we find out Louis actuallydoes assault hookers and he is the reason one of Mick's old clients got wrongly sentenced to life imprisonment. However because of the legal nature between client and attorney, Mick is put in the awkward situation where he is the only one who knows Louis' dark secrets, yet he is obligated by his license not to say anything. This film is packed with amazing actors like Marisa Tomei, William Macy, John Leguizamo and Bryan Cranston to name a few. However there talents a wasted on bitty parts which makes McConaughey and Ryan Phillippe's mediocre acting all the more stark. I'm being a little harsh on McConaughey, I'm not really a huge fan of him when he has to carry the whole movie, but he did really improve his performance for this film. However Ryan Phillippe is fairly forgettable in his role and doesn't really pull of the ""I'm a psychotic and malicious rapist/murder"". This film is not shot particularly well, there's a lot of hand-held and zoom ins which aren't really motivated camera moves except to add realism. Also the tension between characters is really hard to get a hold of, sometimes you won't be sure if characters are afraid of each other, mad at each other, or just indifferent. It's a little confusing. Also there's about a million plot holes that I will go into after the spoiler alert. The film is also weirdly paced with scenes of McConaughey and his romantic relationship with Marisa Tomei and his buddy buddy relationship with his driver and bonds friend. There's just a lot of relationships to keep track of and they sort of trip each other up in terms of what are the more important relationships in the story. The script is also fairly predictable in some instances and the dialogue can come off as corny at times. Overall the average film goer will have fun with all its twists and lawyer lingo. Lincoln lawyer will definitely keep your attention but afterwards you'll probably either start asking yourself questions like I did, or forget about the film. I think with a different cast and a different production team this film could have been much better. ***Spoiler Alert***** Things that didn't make sense to me: -Why did Louis hire Mick if he had already gotten away murdering the first girl? Why didn't he just hire a different lawyer to protect him the way Mick did? Sure they made Mic out to be a good lawyer but he certainly isn't the best lawyer. Is it because he works with scum? Is it because Louis wanted to torture Mick? Is it because he thought the Attorney/client privilege would protect him? It just doesn't make enough sense. -Why does Louis rape and murder women if his mom got raped!!?!? That's like saying someone ran your beloved dog over with a car so your gonna go out and run over as many dogs as I can. -So Louis broke into Mick's house took his gun, then got his mom to shoot Frank in the head!?! That seems a little far fetched...there was no indication that the mom was that evil up until that point. -How would the police not tie the biker gangs assault on Louis back to Mick!?!? He is their lawyer!!! -I think it's a pretty far fetched shot to set up Ted (John Lucas) to use a bad snitch just cuz he's sort of a douche bag. Is Ted really that bad of a lawyer that he didn't research his witness? That's pretty unbelievable. Plus why did Mick do that!?! If he hadn't used the bad snitch Louis woulda gone to jail for the assault?? If you'd like to comment or explain to me some of the plot holes I missed, please do.",The Lincoln Lawyer

It's better if you don't think about it.",6,21 March 2011,"""A lawyer conducts business from the back of his Lincoln town car while representing a high-profile client in Beverly Hills."" That is one of the descriptors for the new movie by Brad Furman, based on a novel by Michael Connelly.Um, why? Why would anyone need to conduct business out of the back of a car? It really is a unique premise if there was a great reason for why he has a town car office and not a typical law office. Unfortunately, there isn't a good excuse why our protagonist Mick (played by Matthew McConaughey) is being chauffeured around Los Angeles. All we know is that he lost his driver's license quite a while ago. It is never clear on why he just doesn't work out of his home. There is something missing here that the director and screenwriter had failed to tell us.Mick is a fast-talking ""Slick Willy"" lawyer. ""High-end ambulance chaser"" comes to mind when I think of his character. He knows how to work a clever bribe to the bailiffs so that he can move his clients up on the docket. He can also negotiate with tough motorcycle gang members without showing the least bit of fear.After establishing his cocky attitude and sleazy ways Mick is hired by a high profile real estate client, Louis (played by Ryan Phillippe), who is being accused of assaulting a high-class prostitute. Even though Louis' family has a lawyer on retainer Louis wants Mick for reasons that will be explained later. The family lawyer has no qualms with hiring Mick and paying a hefty retainer fee (it seems that if you are the best sleaze ball that no one, not even lawyers and gang members, will try to negotiate with you).Mick starts his work on Louis' case with help from his private investigator, Frank (played by William H. Macy) who is one of his only two friends, the other being Mick's chauffeur. While working on the case we find that Mick also has a daughter and an ex-wife (don't worry about paying attention to the daughter she only shows up to establish that Mick isn't a sleaze all of the time).As an audience we are required to do a few things from this point forward.1) Forget the fact that whole premise of the movie is about a lawyer that operates out of his car. We do see his home office quite a bit.2) Be on board with the idea that Louis is a potential murderer in another of Mick's cases. In a city of millions, Mick had a previous client who is in prison for a murder that Louis was tied to earlier.3) Accept another coincidence that Mick has yet another client who is in rehab center with a key witness so that she can get a very important message to this witness. Real easy to believe (I wish that my computer had a sarcastic font).The film does deliver a lot of snappy dialogue and intense courtroom scenes. One courtroom scene was very effective taking into consideration that the director didn't use dramatic music to build the tension. He relied on the actors' ability to set the edgy situation through their dialogue. In the end, there is credibility that even though Mick is a sleaze he does have a desire to up hold the law and keep innocent people out of prison.Should you see this movie? Maybe. If you do go, check your analytical instincts at the door. The film relies heavily on the audience's lack of questioning ability. All that aside, if you want a straight up entertaining judicial film, this would be a good pick for you.",The Lincoln Lawyer

(and yes, that gun could have been linked to him by the old bullets tracing, not the shells, if any bullets have been kept also as it was used in evidence previously as claimed it was still) 4, hard to believe anyone, lawyers included, especially this lawyer, wouldn't have made sure the damaging evidence against his confessed guilty client had made it into the hands of the right people while keeping his hands clean of it. especially after the bad guy made this extra personal by killing his friend. those 4 points brought this otherwise unexceptional typical courtroom drama down from a probably 6.5 or 7 to a 1.to many times movies mistakes are missed or ignored because of all the nice flashy good stuff in between. but if you don't pay attention, you are only fooling yourself.

147,MartianTom,Pretty darn good,8,18 March 2011,"Hey, this isn't half bad at all. I'll be honest and say I wasn't expecting much, so it was nice to be pleasantly surprised. Okay, it's no 'Primal Fear' - but it's as good as any Grisham adaptation.The script is pacey and smart, with some excellent lines from the central character - played with just the right balance of sass and integrity by Matthew McConaughey. In fact, everyone in the cast was up to the mark - and it's always a pleasure to see Marisa Tomei up there: a fine actress who deserves to be seen more often. Willliam H Macy, too, is always worth watching.As for the story... I thought it gave an interesting angle on the classic legal/moral problem : the failed defence in which an innocent client goes to jail, and the successful defence that acquits a killer.I haven't read the Michael Connelly novel, but I think I will now - if only to see more of the Mick Haller character. His back-story wasn't much more than suggested in the film - lost licence, broken marriage, smartness that's a combination of natural intelligence and life at the grittier edge of things. I want to know more! A couple of quiet spots, and a little bit of overstating the obvious (a la 'CSI'), but otherwise this is a highly entertaining film. The perfect antidote to some of the blockbusters and cartoons on offer at the moment.8/10",The Lincoln Lawyer
148,mysteriesfan,"Good TV-caliber plot in a well-acted, well-produced feature film",7,13 May 2011,"The film critics I've read have done an unusually good job discussing The Lincoln Lawyer, as I saw it. I will just hit the main points about the movie, pro and con, that made an impression on me. Overall, I thought the movie was well-acted, well-produced, and entertaining, even if limited by what might be called only a good TV-caliber screenplay.The movie drew me in at the very start when the Lincoln town car of the title and its driver turned out not to be the phony Hollywood glitz I had expected but a seedy image that fit the movie perfectly. (One amateur review's complaint that the car somehow failed to serve its purpose simply because the title character drove around in other vehicles at various points is silly.) The well-acted characters and unusually dingy L.A. settings generally felt authentic, as far as they went. Matthew McConaughey fit naturally, smoothly, and effectively into the lead character of Mick Haller. Haller is a slick, shady L.A. criminal defense lawyer who gets results for his low-life clients, even if things do not always turn out for the best. Haller runs into serious problems, suffers blows from them, does not act always and mindlessly cocky (unlike the annoying, one-note young prosecutor-on-the-make in the movie Fracture), yet draws on enough strength, ingenuity, and resourcefulness that his confidence rarely fails him. This made him fun to watch. Sometimes, he stepped over the line, but not so far as to throw believability to the winds.The story was basically interesting and tied up fairly neatly. In fact, it is quite an accomplishment to make a mystery thriller that was generally this entertaining and satisfying without going completely over the top, the way so many of these kind of movies do (such as The Firm, Final Analysis, Just Cause, Guilty as Sin, General's Daughter, and the Ashley Judd films Double Jeopardy and High Crimes). Lincoln Lawyer was refreshingly free of exploitative, sensational scenes used to gin up cheap shock value, horror, suspense, or titillation.At the same time, I have to agree with the critics that the movie's story and characters do seem familiar. Although workmanlike, including the courtroom scenes, well-handled by McConaughey, the movie lacked the sparks of imagination, originality, intricacy, and electricity that can sometimes come from films like this. It did not really hit the high notes that make watching not just enjoyable but exciting. The writing, while good, seemed more like a script for a high-quality TV show than theatrical film. And some of the supporting characters, especially Haller's ex-wife and the bail bondsman, were badly under-developed and pasted on, wasting talented actors in nothing or contrived roles. Haller's interactions with his ex-wife were not convincing.Similarly unconvincing was the degree to which he felt a crisis of conscience about the way he represented a past client in light of newly discovered information from representing his current, rich-boy client, accused of trying to beat to death a woman he met at a bar. Haller had more practical and selfish reasons for resolving the current case the way he did, without delving so deeply into soul-searching and noble motives, which seemed ill-suited to the rest of the movie.",The Lincoln Lawyer

Also, it's my opinion, Ryan Phillippe is mis-cast. William H. Macy is wasted in this role. I'm a fan of Tomei, so nothing bad about her from me. Matthew McConaughey is steady as the main character, but the directing choice (hand-held) was bad for him.
Everyone I have talked to liked this movie when it came out 9 years ago. It's my opinion everyone liked McConaughey and Phillippe at the time as they were both hot commodities.

It seems to me that Hollywood might have ""dumbed it down."" In my opinion, there is no suspense in this movie, as ""the bad guy"" quickly reveals himself. There is no subsequent tension between the two protagonists. This might have been a fault in the acting of one of them, or from a lack of tension between the two actors, or from the screen writing. W. H. Macy's role and Frances Fisher's role seem like throwaways in spite of being pivotal to the plot, and since they are both excellent actors, I have to assume this results from ineffective screen writing and/or editing. And the movie does seem ""choppy"" to me. Scenes turn up seemingly out of nowhere, and not in a way that made me think, ""aha,"" more like ""huh?""I'd heard good things about McConaughey's acting in the title role, and I don't think I can quibble with that. I believe my ""quibble"" is with the fact that his character seems like one man in the beginning of the movie (let's describe him as a ""lawyerly con-man,"" McConaughey very effective), then becomes a visibly challenged man, then appears back to his assured self again, ""all's right"" with his world. Did he learn anything? That part must have ended up on the cutting room floor.In the novel, for example, a relatively ""minor"" character (as presented in the movie) makes a dramatic career change as a result of occurrences.

My first impression: it was fairly original; the writer managed to craft a fairly original take on a who-dunnit thriller, which is an achievement in itself. There remains however some room for improvement. For example, some of the story seemed phoned in, scenes gratuitous, as if the writer were asking us to go along with parts of the story rather than giving us a reason to. There could have been much more drama and suspense, especially in the key relationship between attorney and client, especially at the end when you wonder just how the whole thing is going to resolve. They could have added suspense by playing up Mccoughnehey's toying with Roulet; in general making more of a dance out of that. In essence, there were some angles that could have been worked more.

The Lincoln Lawyer follows the story of Haller as he takes on Louis Roulet (Played by Ryan Phillippe) who has been suspected of assault. But as he represents him starts to question the good in what he is doing and the morals of his actions. This is one of McConaughey's finest roles in a long time but is nothing compared to William H. Macy who plays his detective in the case and brings a charismatic and involved attitude, stealing the limelight off of anyone else on screen.The problems that lie within The Lincoln Lawyer however are the horrible plot points that often appear out of nowhere to do nothing other than twist the story, especially around the halfway mark of the film. Along side this is the constant thought of how this would fit better as a late night television movie, it doesn't feel cinematic enough and the courtroom scene feel like missed opportunities to show this.

As such, it manages to avoid many of those weary scenes where prosecutors look incredibly clever and witnesses trip up over their own stupidity and an endless parade of cuts to the jury conveying all manner of emotive responses.Instead, we get a fast moving, sexy thriller that relies heavily on the films lead - McConaughey, who is fantastic as the young upstart lawyer Mickey Haller. Initially portrayed as a hustler with a law degree, the protagonist quickly develops into a more conscionable character as the case he undertakes shapes up to be more than he expected. McConaughey turns in a very solid performance and his growing sense of guilt and turmoil are convincing and subtle. Tomei, always excellent, plays the leads ex-wife - Maggie, a prosecutor who no longer had the stomach for her husbands ability to defend guilty clients. Phillippe puts in a great performance also, as Louis Roulet, the defendant in the films twisty-turny case, giving a certain eeriness to role of the spoilt rich kid.

It's his performance that makes the story feel different. What really makes an actor great. To make a well written character look good on-screen, hell no. Art lies in detail. It's what you do with that written material. And gosh! Does McConaughey deliver.. Does with all guns blazing.. The nuances is what makes this character empathetic and it's in those nuances that you'd feel like coming back and watching this film again.. A thriller of the highest quality..

178,kinderhead,Matthew McConaughey was el perfecto for the role,7,20 May 2011,"The name is a bit of a misnomer, because there really isn't much happening from the Lincoln, except for a few add on scenes - its seems more a gimmick to promote the car...not that it detracts from the overall quality of the film, not at all. A gripping drama right from minute one onwards without any letup. Excellent direction and dialogues, MM was just perfect for the role, and mind you he was laid back and smarty pants in just the right proportions...and no, at no time did he come across as a manipulative weasel as some reviewers have suggested. Just a street smart criminal lawyer, but not a crooked one. Ryan Phillipe was excellent as the accused but what was missing was a pretty face to add the obligatory glam factor to the otherwise fast paced script. Marie Tomei looked a bit peaked (a euphemism for haggard). All in all, well worth a look see.",The Lincoln Lawyer
179,hunter_kudjo,Succeeded Expectations,8,7 January 2012,"The first half-hour of this I would've rated a 5/10. McCon-o-hay as well as the rest of the cast in the first half-hour was a bit unbelievable for me. Here he is, conducting business from the back of his Lincoln, rolling in the dirty money left and right, and everybody, from police officer to desk secretary, act like BA's. Everybody's so damn cocky I was pretty sure this was yet another awful, mediocre acting poop film starring an under-performing McCon-o-hay. Everybody speaks in this hushed, threatening tone, as if they mean business, when at ever turn, McCon-o-hay gets his way.The rest of the movie reverses all that. Things fall apart so quickly for our main protagonist, that I realize all the previous flashy-lawyer-act was just setting up the fall. Additionally, the main character subtly realizes that it's not all about the dollar either, also reversing his slightly corrupt behavior in the opening sequences.The film presents an excellent and sticky situation not too many have thought of before. From 00:30:00 out I was on the edge of my seat, completely bewildered at how anything can be right again. Not to mention, the acting took an upswing all the way to the end as well.Overall, bear through the first 30 minutes of this, and you'll be rewarded with an excellent mystery/thriller.8/10 for not disappointing.",The Lincoln Lawyer

The plot keeps twisting and turning, not giving a chance to rest one's mind and the characters are compelling and intriguing. There is enough action and behind-the-scene plotting to keep you on the edge of the seat, to keep you guessing and trying to crack the mystery yourself. The acting, in my humble opinion, is superb, especially that of the main villain. When the villain wraps you around his finger and makes you believe he is not the villain at all, that is what I call a win hands down. While some may find the general idea of the good guy always outwitting his adversaries one way or the other pretty much repetitive throughout the movie, it is not the outcome that counts but the road taken to achieve it.",The Lincoln Lawyer

Did not clearly understand the relationship with Haller and his ex wife (maybe better explained in the books)... my one issue involved a bathroom scene with the defendant and his lawyer.

183,gus495,The Ultimate Courtroom Drama Trope Collection,4,7 February 2015,"Mick Haller (Matthew McConaughey) is a high profile defense attorney. He seems to have everything going for him, until he takes up the case of a wealthy client accused of murder. The subsequent string of events that unravel makes him question his morals and beliefs, and yadda yadda yadda bla bla bla. Something evil psychopath trying to get away with murder something something cat and mouse game turns into a court room drama and presto we get the Lincoln Lawyer. It has all the underpinnings of what makes the great courtroom dramas great, so it in turn must be great too, right? It is amazing to see a product focusing so hard on delivering thrills and failing so immensely in the process. I'm sure that whoever wrote or directed this must have been an avid fan of John Grisham, because he or she took every last trope from the books and did absolutely nothing with it. The tonal dissonance doesn't become totally clear until the later stages of the movie, but by then it is hard to even get what the point of the movie was in the first place. The last scene ends with McConaughey proverbially walking into the sunset while his former client is being non-proverbially beaten to death by his posse. Cue shootout and the final scene in which our hero is united with his family. It would all be offensive if it wasn't so hilariously misguided.The sole saving grace of this movie comes from McConaughey. It's not the performance of a lifetime, but he's doing his best with what he has been given. The courtroom scenes in the latter half are interesting to watch, but just only because he sells the triple agent role Haller finds himself in. Is it worth sitting through two hours of exposition dialogue and sigh inducing stereotypes to get there? Probably not. Let us remember then The Lincoln Lawyer as the start of McConaughey turn to drama acting, because that is about all of significance this movie will probably be remembered for.",The Lincoln Lawyer
184,canaryalive,Great movie! I really enjoyed it.,10,29 April 2011,"What distinguish it from other thrillers and crime dramas is the atmosphere and quite unconventional characters and situations. I really enjoyed the soundtrack of the movie. Also I liked the most the beginning of the movie, which introduced us to the main character Haller, before he starts to deal with the rape case. I haven't read the book but in the way this character was so fully depicted, mentioning and seeing his other clients, I realized that the movie isn't going to be only for a particular case but telling us a story of a lawyer who gets small criminals out of jail and his consciousness about it. He seemed unscrupulous and unprincipled but at the same time we see that there are some clients he really cares for. Matthew McConaughey did very good job in this movie in my opinion. I really believed him in most of the situations. Ryan Phillippe and Josh Lucas were hilariously bad. I laughed at every scene they were, so theatrical and naive performances. Marisa Tomei was OK though a little not believable as a woman whose profession is a prosecutor. But I guess her character's main goal was to bring a little warmth and sex appeal to Haller and nothing more. Other actors who stood up for me were Katherine Moennig, who played the hooker in the jail and Shea Whigham, who played the snitch. Although their roles were very small and screen time limited they were very believable, real and their characters were unconventional and interesting to watch. The scene with McConaughey and Moennig in jail was quite moving and showed depth of Haller and desperation of a lost kid in the hooker, which is not usually how someone will play a hooker. I also like a lot the rockers in the movie which brought quite a color and entertainment. I cannot say anything about the other actors because their roles were very standard and nothing deep or unconventional. As a whole I recommend this movie to anyone, who want to see a good crime drama with a little humor and some action.",The Lincoln Lawyer
185,staff-577-378882,Review: Lincoln Lawyer,8,18 March 2011,"I know what you're thinking and I can agree with you that the name, Matthew McConaughey, does not instill great confidence that you're going to get a great movie experience. Now that is not to say that McConaughey hasn't done some great movies. For every Ghosts of Girlfriend's Past, Sahara, and Failure to Launch there are We Are Marshall and How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days. Lincoln Lawyer is luckily part of the later group and reminds us that McConaughey can carry movie without having to take off his shirt in every scene.Lincoln Lawyer is a thrilling drama about a cocky and smooth defense attorney Mick Haller, played by McConaughey, who represents a high-profile client on charges of attempted murder. But as new evidence continues to pile on, Mick starts to grow suspicious that perhaps his client isn't telling him everything. With twists and turns at every corner, Lincoln Lawyer keeps you guessing till the very end.With the help of that distinct country voice and southern charm, McConaughey takes the movie to another level with this portrayal of the fast-talking lawyer. With the role of Mick, McConaughey is actually given a chance to show off a range of emotions that will truly surprise viewers. Mcconaughey doesn't carry this alone, Lincoln Lawyer gets some great acting from the likes of William H. Macy, Michael Pena, John Leguizamo, Josh Lucas, and Marisa Tomei. The only black sheep of his movie comes from the alleged murderer Louis Roulet, played by the ever wooden Ryan Phillippe. The only thing I find amazing from Phillippe's attempt at acting is his unique talent to deliver every line of dialogue without moving a single muscle on his face.The tension and intensity that begins to engulf Mike as the case continues is stellar. Lincoln Lawyer really pushes Mike to edge as his whole world becomes begins to collapse due to his Attorney-Client relationship. This is where Lincoln Lawyer really comes alive and delivers a must see movie experience. The court room scenes are some of my favorite scenes in the movie and there are plenty. The approach they took to portraying the lawyer aspect of the film feels accurate and realistic. The plot is solid and keeps you invested right from the beginning and keeps the grip tight throughout the movie. The movie keeps a good pacing and the dialogue is smart and witty. The film's color and camera work gives a very raw feel although at times it can be a little too unstable. The story and characterization is done well but there are a few things that should have been given more focus, like Mike and Maggie's relationship and more insight as to why they got divorced. The movie touches on the idea with a scene or two but never really reveals too much. We also never really get too much on Mike's relationship with his daughter. My biggest problem with the film was the underwhelming ending that really had everything necessary to end the movie with, but still felt lackluster when it came. However, don't let these few problems sway you. I strongly recommend this film and promise you that you will leave satisfied.-www.MovieFloss.com",The Lincoln Lawyer
186,moviemania513,Mcconaughey actually does more than just show up,8,21 March 2011,"The Lincoln Lawyer is a 2011 crime drama directed by Michael Connelly and starring Matthew McConaughey, Ryan Phillippe and Marisa Tomei. Lawyer Mickey Haller (McConaughey) is a defense attorney in Beverly Hills who occasionally operates out of his black sedan. He is called in to defend Louis Roulet (Phillippe) for a murder and faces difficulty ahead, which doesn't include his recent divorce from his wife Maggie (Tomei).This is one that McConaughey actually does more than just show up. He gives entertainment and has a sense of humor as well. I think he's the perfect actor to play a role like this. I also like how Tomei and Phillippe carry out their roles too.

He knows all the ins and outs of the legal system and how to exploit them to his clients' advantage. But after agreeing to defend a wealthy young man accused of rape and murder, Mickey suddenly finds himself embroiled in a deadly game of violence, vengeance and deception that threatens to not only end his career, but also his life. The Good: Matthew McConaughey. He got a lot of praise for this role when this movie came and, and deservedly so. He did an excellent job of portraying emotions and inner turmoil through facial expressions and body language. He was believable throughout the entire film. The story. It had me figuring it out as it went rather than 5 minutes in. It's not a story I've seen 10 times in other movies. It kept me interested until the end.The Bad: Ryan Phillipe. He really wasn't terrible, but I've never been a huge fan of him. He doesn't have much stage presence. However, it does kind of work in this role. His character called for a sense of coldness, but I think there could have been a little more to him. Recommend? Yes. There is some moderate language and the nature of the alleged crimes is very serious. So it is not for the younger crowd. I give this film 4 out of 5 stars.",The Lincoln Lawyer

But it is easily one of Matthew McConaughey's best movies I've seen in a while. He actually surprised me in this movie.

190,ak_stinger,The Good Far Outweighs the Bad,8,19 March 2011,"As a fan of the book and of the character of Mickey Haller in general, I was skeptical about Matthew McConaughey playing the part. I was very pleased with the way he played the heck out of the character, with all the smarm, charm, conviction, and vulnerability needed to capture Haller and and make an audience root for him. Marisa Tomei was great as Maggie McPherson - she and McConaughey have a nice, grown-up chemistry. William H. Macy's Frank Levin was endearing and funny, which made what happened to his character even more tragic. Bryan Cranston's hard-nosed and crusty portrayal of Detective Lankford and the chemistry between him and McConaughey in their few scenes together makes me willing to overlook the fact that he played this character if they make ""The Brass Verdict"" - the sequel of ""The Lincoln Laywer"" - into a movie and want to cast him as Harry Bosch.There were a few deficiencies, however. Ryan Phillippe was passable as Louis Roulet, but he came across more spoiled rich boy than the face of true evil that he was supposed to be. He had a boo-hiss moment or two but it never really felt like he was a worthy opponent for Haller. Frances Fisher as Roulet's mother was criminally underused; her vital role at the end of the movie felt a bit anti-climatic and forced because we never got a true sense of how twisted the character was.This isn't a movie that MUST be seen on the big screen, but it's worth the cost of a movie ticket if you like legal dramas that rely on emotional and cerebral drama instead of action-packed chases and explosions.",The Lincoln Lawyer

A smoothtalking,grinning,charming lawyer who will defend exactly anyone,he knows most of his clients are guilty,as long as the prize is right.Did I say meet Michael Haller....? My bad.I,of course meant meet Matthew McConaughey.Now,I haven't read any of the Haller books and I don't know if he's supposed to be in great physical shape,have a thick Texas accent and the the standard McConaughey haircut...but I kinda doubt it.Come on directors,if he refuses to try to transform into the character...make him.Cut his hair,force him to get get a accent coach,something...I feel as he is miscast and Josh Brolin,Eric Bana or Mark Ruffalo would've been to prefer.Anyhow,once you established and can accept that McConaughey really isn't a great actor but this time around actually seems to try(And by the end of the film,you realize that here and there,he was actually pretty good as hims...as Michael Haller.),you might find yourself pretty entertained by this L.A. light Noir thriller.Ryan Phillippe,as the rich snob Louis Roulet,Hallers client and accused of attempted murder to which he claims his innocence is also usually pretty wooden but here,he and McConaughey have a good chemistry and Phillippe is surprisingly restrained and believable.The rest of the cast includes a small but good and a bit unusual(Not so nerdy) turn from William H.Macy as a detective and close friend to Haller,Marisa Tomei delivers as Hallers ex-wife and is still hot,still has a great screen presence.John Leguizamo is reliable as always and Bryan Cranston(Breaking Bad)is a cop giving Haller a hard time,poorly written role but solid performance.Frances Fisher(The Kingdom) portrays mother Roulet very well,oozing of upper-class stiffness and coldness but none the less a caring and worried mother.Josh Lucas on the other hand seems extremely uninterested and bored as the prosecutor,appearing to read his lines with the help of a small earpiece.It's the only bad performance of the movie...While going through Roulets case,Haller finds a connection to one of his previous cases and realizes that he might've helped put an innocent man in jail,a young latino named Jesus Martinez played by Michael Pena.He only has two scenes but delivers a strong and very moving performance...Here,The Lincoln Lawyer fails a bit and gets a bit stressed.Hallers fall from grace when realizing what he MIGHT'VE done...he goes from smug,carefree and cynical to a very sweaty man who questions his values,his moral,his whole life and career while chugging down whiskey straight from the bottle...In about 4 seconds....but it's quickly followed by new developments in the story,new people to suspect,a tragic event that is sort of a minor semi-twist,so I can overlook that part.There aren't many dull moments in The Lincoln Lawyer,the pace is quick,the score is subtle and effective,the editing solid,you will get your minor share of both predictable and unpredictable twists and the screenplay isn't extremely original but at least feels pretty authentic and only has One plot hole according to me and for a Courtroom thriller year 2011,that's pretty impressive.And as I said,overall it's a good acting job by this ensemble.The lawyer is at times exactly like this review...a bit inconsistent,meaning the director gives us some great scenes that are very dark,atmospheric,violent and tense in true noir style,only to loose a lot of emotional and suspenseful impact when his direction in a few key scenes feels pretty uninterested,too PG-13 and lifeless,almost TV-movie of the week-like.Especially in the third act when moral preaching,standard legal system criticism and cleverly constructed plotdevelopment end up replacing a part of the suspense.If 3 outta 5 means good,then 6 outta 10 is the verdict overall.It passes for a good thriller that you will have forgotten about a few hours after you've seen it.",The Lincoln Lawyer

The authenticity and heart of the book were kind of lost and stripped away but even when you strip away the greater elements of a Michael Connelly book to the bones you still have a skeleton that is much better than most movies these days so the main story, minus the witty and introspective first person narration and the back-story of each ex wife and character that it told, it was still great enough to keep everyone in the theater on the edge of their seats. The dialog and the cockiness of Haller shines through with Matthew, although Mariso Tomei was wasted as Maggie Mcfierce whose part was greatly reduced in the transition from novel to film by the clearly inept screen writer but even the crap writer who gave us cop rock and the director that gave us trash like Takers couldn't ruin the tale weaved by Connelly and the character come alive via Mconaughey .

I have seen a hundred movies in the past 2 or 3 months, but believe me I never got this involved into any of those as much as I did in this movie... a few things should have been more in details, which would have increased the charm of the movie to a greater level...I would just like to implore all the serious movie-viewers, who watch movie for not just fun, but for admiring the talents of cinematography and all its part and parcel, they should definitely watch this one... it's a movie of its own kind out for you in a long time...",The Lincoln Lawyer

I can imagine how some people would have issues with the pacing. The movie moves along at a very fast speed.

I was told that with my impaired hearing, I'd miss too much of the plot. So I got the DVD, put on subtitles and gave it a go.I'm so glad I did.The two highlights for me:The actingThere were no great tests of range or ability in the script, but that should not take away the fact that there wasn't a weak performance in the whole cast. Most were impeccable, and out in front was the excellent Matthew McConaughey. He didn't put a foot wrong and was so very believable. It's not that difficult to gain sympathy as a loveable rouge, but perhaps not one as obnoxious as McConaughey was at the beginning, but he pulled it off. The plotIt built at a steady pace, something that is often missing in modern films, giving time to place incidents and information. We were given time to settle in, pick up the details and get to know people before any real plotting started. There were no tricks. We were kept up to date most of the time and when we weren't, it was made obvious.Negatives:The dialogueEven my subtitle software got confused at times by Matthew McConaughey, the most notable being a pre-child hearing. OK, so the accent placed him; even I, from the UK, could understand the nuance. It was just the words that I couldn't. I'd have been floundering to understand the film in a cinema.VisualsI like to have memorable scenes but most were generic. I know a court is a court, is a court, but an unusual camera angle might have been nice. CluesThere were a lot of clues as to what the outcome would be. I liked to be surprised with red herrings, but it was too predictable. Even with the final switch; I'd already worked it out.Overall, a pleasant waste of a couple of hours. I was sucked right in. I used to be a police officer and I regularly gave evidence - 135 full witness orders in two years, the highest in my force. I know what goes on and what goes on is not what went on in this film. However, this did not detract one bit - real life court procedures are boring. It was great entertainment.I enjoyed it.",The Lincoln Lawyer
207,bob1701,A Good Film,7,17 July 2011,"The rating for this film when I saw it was 7.4 which by IMDb standards is fairly high, so my expectations were high as well. The movie started off well, the story and characters were interesting and I have always enjoyed courtroom movies so it didn't take much for me to get into it. Then the story takes a turn for the unlikely and what starts off as a realistic crime drama becomes a very coincidental Matthew M. film.The story is overall not bad, but there are just too many instances where I was thinking, ""that worked out well for him."" You never feel like the good characters are in danger or that the story might favour the bad guys in any meaningful way. This is a happy ending story all the way. Having said that the film did keep my interest almost the whole time, the story is somewhat unique.The acting is fine, Matthew M. plays himself which is not necessarily a bad thing. I liked him in A Time to Kill and I liked him in this film as well. Ryan Phillippe is boring as the bad guy.I am surprised that this movie has a 7.4 rating, my ratings often are similar to the IMDb average but I have a bias towards these types of movies and giving it a 7/10 was pushing it for me.",The Lincoln Lawyer

209,kevf22,A good thriller powered by the actors and clever direction.,7,20 April 2011,"A better than expected crime drama here from Brad Furman that is based on the book of the same name by best seller author, Michael Connelly in which the clear driving force is Matthew McConaughey but has a strong support cast in Marisa Tomei, Ryan Phillippe, William H. Macy, Josh Lucas and John Leguizamo. McConaughey plays a cocky and successful defense lawyer who is given the case of a supposed attempted murder on a woman by a rich and high profile man played by Phillippe. While investigating this case he realizes that certain things are amiss and a previous case in which he lost, could be linked. At the start of this film i really wasn't sure about it as it seemed to be McConaughey pretty much type cast with the cocky, too cool for school attitude and the hip hop soundtrack blaring and sometimes flashy camera style camera-work (that i am not a fan of at all) but this film is actually quite intelligently made and has some really nice twists and turns in it. It is by know means a by the numbers thriller and is quite gripping at times. I have to give kudos to the director for this as he must have knew exactly what he was doing with how it starts. Combine these things with a tight script, brilliant cast with great performances out of all (the ever reliable Macy as his investigator, the ultra MILF Tomei as his ex and prosecutor opposite and Phillippe doing the spoilt rich brat impeccably) and you have a entertaining thriller with a satisfying end. Some may be put off by how it starts but i defy you not to be gripped once it gets going.",The Lincoln Lawyer

There are a couple corny moments that I could pick out between the main character Mick and his driver but other than that it is flawless. The movie blew me away. The story between Mick and Marisa Tomei's character should have had a little more depth. It will make the readers understand the life of a defense lawyer.

Great on screen chemistry and McConaughey could do no wrong as Lawyer Mickey Haller.Not to mention Ryan Phillippe's eery and stunning role. The whole cast was perfect, including William H.

And we loved his chemistry with his ex-wife attorney, Marisa Tomei. I remembered how terrific Matthew McConaughey was in 'A Time to Kill.' I still cry when I watch that emotional summation he made to the jury in one take. John Grisham even said the movie 'A Time to Kill' was better than his book, and the only movie better than it's book.

I don't usually like Matthew McConaughey, but he is the perfect sleazy lawyer with a conscious. This movie is an excellent adaptation of a Connelly novel.

215,Knoedelkop,Very decent courtroom thriller,8,29 June 2012,"First of all, you, the honored reader, should keep in mind that the genre of film to which The Lincoln Lawyer belongs, is a genre I usually enjoy a lot and of which I am a (big) fan. However, this film stars Matthew McConaughey as leading actor, which made me wait and see whether this movie would be to my taste. The courtroom films depend on good acting as opposed to more action based movies and genres. The Lincoln Lawyer provides that good acting: not only do we have McConaughey performing very well, we also have the supporting actors and actresses doing a very neat job, ensuring that there are no weak scenes throughout the film. Another crucial aspect of the courtroom film is the storyline, and again we are not disappointed. Where the storyline takes one or two turns and twists too many at the very end of the movie, in general the flow is not too fast nor too slow, with the required couple of shocks when your notion of people isn't quite as accurate as you though it was. All in all, The Lincoln Lawyer is a very enjoyable movie for all people who prefer an in-depth storyline every now and then. It's a clever movie with all the right ingredients for having a good time.",The Lincoln Lawyer

218,z-88766,Not super original but very entertaining film,7,19 February 2017,"This film is a very entertaining, if a little dumbed-down/simplified story. It is not easy to make a completely original courtroom drama, considering that this is not really a new genre and considering that there are shows like Law and Order (the original) that were releasing 21+ episodes of courtroom drama a year.There are original legal dramas, it is not impossible, but you need more time than a film. Suits, The Night Of and some others take their time to tell a long story. In a film of 2 hours, it's much harder.Having that said, they did a great job here. The production values are high. The script is tight, without pointless subplots and missing plot threads. It never feels too long nor rushed. The music does its part, the cinematography is very good, keeps things fresh and interesting. The one flaw I would say this film has is that there isn't much of a twist. Let me explain. It's not predictable to the point where you're guessing and taking bets on what happens next, but a lot of that is due to them telling you exactly what's what. The mystery part is unexplored, so we don't have that suspense. We don't get a chance to think or try to solve the puzzle, we just get to watch the story unravel like a magic trick.This is good film nonetheless and if Hollywood made more films like this, not necessarily 10/10 films week in week out (which is impossible, unless you're a very generous reviewer) then I'd say we are in a kind of golden age of cinema.Unfortunately, the average film these days is a 4/10 or 5/10 cashgrab, as sequels, requels make these original 7/10 films as rare as 9/10s and 10/10s.",The Lincoln Lawyer

226,runbei-220-757604,Slow down....!,7,1 January 2012,"Comparisons of films with the books they're based are not, always, odious, especially when the book is a masterpiece, and the film...isn't.The problem with this excellently cast and produced movie is that it's just a mite tad too slick. Michael Connelly's book shows attorney Mickey Haller from the start as not entirely a sleaze. While he does get bad guys off, he works within the system, such as it is, and he does have a refined moral sense; and it's evident from the start of the book that he's a good guy and that sense is destined to come out.If you could play back the movie at half-speed, perhaps you might get the true feel of the story. It should not have been made as a fast-paced adventure-thriller. That was never Connelly's intention, and it spoils a lot of the experience. What happens in the book is that Mickey Haller's character evolves. He's sick of the law, of playing the game, and longs to be his better self. A difficult case gives him the chance, and he takes it.Connelly does a wonderful job of showing us how Mickey molts from a sleeping soul to a shining knight. Michael Connelly is a master craftsman. He does, in short, clear sentences, what lesser writers can never do - he touches our hearts. Read the reviews of the book on Amazon; you'll see how many readers valued this.It is, after all, one of the great themes of books that inspire and uplift: a person faces difficult tests, is jolted out of their usual way of being, and finds fulfillment in doing the right thing. Connelly is just a wonderful writer. Obviously, his classic book was passed through the meat grinder by Hollywood bean-counters. ""People like fast action - okay, we'll take this exemplary book and turn it into 'The Detective' on methamphetamine."" The best I can say about it is that I hope it will make some viewers curious about the book. It probably won't; it just doesn't give us an experience that many of us would want to risk repeating. If you read Michael Connelly's book, Bloodwork, then saw the movie, I can tell you that the difference is just about that extreme, and that unfortunate. Bloodwork was a great book, and the movie, as expected, sucked.",The Lincoln Lawyer

229,spevpro,"Glibber than noir, The Lincoln Lawyer fails to provoke.",6,20 March 2011,"Lawyer Mickey Haller is in for the ride of his life. Played by Mathew McConaughy, fast-talking Haller is chauffeured in his black 1980's-vintage Lincoln Town Car to and from the courtrooms and jail cells of the greater Los Angeles area following his street clientèle through the criminal justice system.Based on the court fiction novel by veteran crime writer Michael Connolly, the film is a reasonably fresh approach to the genre without the moralizing overtones of the corrupt justice system gone badly, or lawyers as seedy bottom feeders in pursuit of the buck. By merely hinting at this with glib humour however, The Lincoln Lawyer never strays too far from the middle even though it provides a good enough storyline supported by an excellent cast.Mickey Haller, the self-styled Lincoln Lawyer is brought to the attention of the wealthy Windsor/Roulet family by a police department insider (John Luguizamo.) It helps to have friends both inside the force and on the fringes of the system, even if they are not-so-worldly as Luguizamo's character Val asserts, ""Roulet, like the game!""32 year old Louis Roulet (Ryan Phillippe) is in jail following an arrest for assault and attempted rape of a prostitute. With a six figure bank account and fast cars, he has become easy pray for possible fleecing and this is the defence that McConaughy pursues. Louis is supported by his mother in the tweed Chanel suits, Mary Windsor, played by small screen star Francis Fisher as the matriarch of untold wealth gained from a combination of California real estate sales and former husbands. Phillippe is convincing in the role, asserting his story of getting hit over the head by the prostitute only to wake up to the police at the crime scene.At this point the film becomes a straightforward, 'who's story do you believe,' and as such, with the help of a private investigator efficiently played by William H. Macy, McConaughy begins to strip away at the facts, first from suspected manipulation by police, and then from the story of his client.Marisa Tomei plays the prosecuting attorney ex-wife of McConaughy who is not assigned to the case but helps to round out the characters by providing more insider information, along with Malcolm in the Middle and Breaking Bad's Brian Cranston. Country singer Trace Adkins gets in on the act as the underworld biker-gang leader forcing the Lincoln onto the road shoulder once in a while to add a sub-plot that, in the crime genre style, comes back to tie in nicely when needed - sort of like biker white nights. While there are enough reveals in the plot to keep you in suspense, this is no suspense crime thriller. First of all, McConaughy's character is too glib to suffer for any length of time, and there's no hint that his character ascends to self-awareness or triumphs bitter sweet as the classic patsy, as Russell Crowe and Guy Pierce do in LA Confidential (1997) or Jack Nicholson in Chinatown (1974). More romantic drama is displayed in the Lincoln Lawyer sex scene by ex-partners McConaughy and Tomei than hardboiled grittiness or even wanton abandon.The camera is kept tight on the characters however, with only the Lincoln Town Car getting wider angles, and the film pacing is pretty good with short scenes held together by the familiar cast. Over all you are taken along for the ride with McConaughy's shining white smile in the bright mid-day sun of Los Angeles California. But at 119 minutes, the producers could have squeezed one or two more darker scenes and a thin layer of dirt, or developed the Haller characters family background – and, perhaps in the end, maybe just a little more moralizing.

The characters range from predictable regulars to almost jaw-dropping stereo-types and there is fun to be had in spotting them and comparing their rendering to other productions in the same genre.

Is Matthew McConaughey so much so a pretty boy that he can't be taken seriously as an actor, even after a performance like this? What a shame. This was the first time that I saw him take on a role, since his portrayal of Jake Tyler Brigance in A Time To Kill, that made me think, this guy can seriously act. What an underrated film.And what a great supporting cast. Marisa Tomei, William H Macy, Ryan Phillipe plays the bad guy role very well. He's likable like in Cruel Intentions but the character of Louis Roulet isn't as redeemable.

I've been told that this is the first movie of 2011 that deserves Academy Award discussion. To that notion, I'd say that I think this movie is a little bit over-hyped. Don't get me wrong, it has a strong cast and surprisingly engaging performances by Matthew and Ryan (great as the bad guy). Marisa Tomei is such a natural that it's impossible not to focus on her when the camera grabs her essence. Anyway, it's a great story...intense and lots of twists and turns...I think it's the first time that I've respected a performance by McCaunahey...but I knew the mother was in on it well before her true identity came into focus.The only part of the story that I wish had been explored more was the reasoning behind the character's psychology for killing prostitutes. To me, it was clear that after what happened to his mother, he was filled with such hate and vengeance that he wanted to hurt any woman who was not emblematic of his mother. It was his way of justifying his mother's rape. He felt that if he could hurt those who truly deserved to be brutalized, he would slowly remove himself from the trauma and reasoning behind his mother's rape...distancing himself from the act (in a very deeply traumatic sort of way) I wanted the story to explore the subconscious sociopathic elements of the character.",The Lincoln Lawyer

It also helps when you have a solid cast. In this case Marisa Tomei, William H. Macy, John Leguizamo, Josh Lucas, Frances Fisher, Michael Pena and Ryan Phillippe.

William H. Macy, as Hiller's investigator, steals whatever show there is. (The defendant, whose name I cannot even remember is, well, forgettable.) This story, which involves themes like a lawyer's obligations to his criminal client, has been far better portrayed, not to mention acted, by the main character and those around him/her, in films like ""Primal Fear"" (Richard Gere), ""Jagged Edge"" (Glen Close), ""Devil's Advocate"" (Keannu Reeves) and of course ""Witness for the Prosecution"" (Charles Laughton), to name a few.

241,stockbliss,An excellent distillation of a complex plot,9,2 April 2011,"For years I have wondered when someone would finally get around to adapting a Michael Connelly novel into a movie. Since most movies that are based on a good novel end up being major disappointments, I didn't have high hopes for The Lincoln Lawyer. Alas, I was very pleasantly surprised that this rendition, for the most part, achieved success in capturing the gist of the novel. McConaughey was definitely the right pick for the leading role as Mickey Haller. The movie, of course, leaves out big parts of the book, but that is an unfortunate consequence of converting a complex crime story into a 2-hour feature film. I'm not going to bother recapping all of the intricacies of the movie since you can easily get plenty of that from other reviews. I will say that I give this film very good odds of having a sequel called ""The Brass Verdict"" within the next year or so.",The Lincoln Lawyer
242,dubeiram,a bit late to the party,7,4 May 2011,"i know this review is a bit late with the movie out for about 6 weeks.. i had read the book and you always hear .. the movie was reasonably loyal to the book plot.. and it is impossible to cram a 400 page novel into a 2 hour movie and get all the details and subtelties (sp) that would be in a book... but i felt that there was room to better build the characters more true to the book and their relationships and thats my biggest complaint about what Hollywood does to most novels. at least they didn't change who the ""bad guy"" was unlike the way they destroyed ""Bloodwork"" for the big screen... anyway wait for it on netflix and as most of the other reviewers have said.. the camera work is terrible...",The Lincoln Lawyer
243,ride288,Lincoln Lawyer Informal Review,8,21 September 2011,"The Lincoln Lawyer entertained me entirely, and I give it 8/10 stars. It kept me on edge throughout the majority of the movie. The director, Brad Furman, did a great job of dropping subtle hints throughout the movie that swallowed you into the story. The thrilling story line follows Mick Haller (Matthew McConaughey), a defense attorney for the rugged low class criminals of California, who rolls up to court in the back of a classic Lincoln Town Car. In the story, Mick receives an unusual and suspicious client, Louis Roulet (Ryan Philippe). Roulet, a rich upper class real estate agent, has been accused of deadly assault and sexual battery, and claims he is completely innocent. Long story short, Mick rides his Lincoln through a twisted and thrilling case that forces him to rethink his past to save himself, his family, and his past clients.The acting was much better than I expected. I'm a big fan of McConaughey, but lets face it, he's had some weak films. However, as the tension and excitement build in this movie, Haller's morals and values are tested to the breaking point, and McConaughey plays it perfectly. From intense court scenes, to desperation to do what's right, and to drunken rage, McConaughey does it all. Philippe, who gives Roulet a dirty, suspicious, and high-class criminal personality that torments Mick, only compliments McConaughey's acting. The acting as a whole is solid and creates an intense thriller.It's hard to find flaws in the movie, because so many factors help make this thriller movie great including: the solid acting, fitting music, the suspenseful and thrilling storyline, and the legit and intense courtroom scenes. However, I can think of two things that could be better. The flow in the beginning of the story, while introducing characters, is a little rough and sketchy. Also, the ending is good and fits the story completely, but it just doesn't ""wow"" me. Regardless, both of these are hardly reason enough to not see the movie. It's. An. Awesome. Movie. I really recommend it if you like thrillers, B.A. cars, and intense court scenes.",The Lincoln Lawyer

245,andrecoquieri,The Lincoln Lawyer!,9,29 March 2014,"For me, this is the best movie I ever see in my life. It have a good story and a excellent actor. And criminal movies are the best. I don't speak English, but I gonna try to write something here. Matthew McConaughey are great in his character, he's a very good actor, and he deserved at least one indication for something. And the story helps too, it's a very good screenplay, it's so good, that I have a DVD and a blu- ray copy and my house to watch the time I want. If you want a big, great movie, I indicate this movie for you, but if you want a bad or normal movie, I indicate this movie too, because you'll like very much, like me.",The Lincoln Lawyer
246,NielsEmil,Horrible use of popular music,5,10 September 2015,"""Mick Haller is a defense lawyer who works out of his Lincoln. When a wealthy Realtor is accused of assaulting a prostitute, Haller is asked to defend him. The man claims that the woman is trying to get some money out of him. But when Haller looks at the evidence against him, he learns that this case might be linked to an old case of his."" This movie absolutely butchers the music that has been chosen! None of the tracks gets the attention or time that they deserve, and because of that, they do not at all support the picture. The plot, the scenes and the quality of the actors is all really OK, but the misuse of music destroys my experience. It is hard to understand why a movie with this kind of budget, can't get the use of the soundtrack right!",The Lincoln Lawyer

250,milner007,Disappointing,5,24 March 2011,"First, I can't wait until all this hand-held jerky camera biz and extreme close-ups of faces is over with. It is so distracting. Also, when people are talking to one another they are usually more than 2 inches apart, but not in this movie. All that made me crazy. It's not a bad movie, just not very good. And when Mick goes to see the man he had represented that was convicted of the other prostitute's murder and shows him a picture of Roulet, who was the actual killer, the guy just freaks out! What was that? If he recognized the guy that could be his ticket out of jail but instead he just declares the interview over. There were other plot holes and stupid scenes- this was more like a made for TV movie.",The Lincoln Lawyer
