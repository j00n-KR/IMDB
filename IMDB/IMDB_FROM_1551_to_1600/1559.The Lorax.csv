0,MartinHafer,"Way, way too heavily padded and loud for its own good.",3,30 October 2018,"Thneedville is a plasticized world where everything is about consumerism and creating an environment with fake grass, trees and bushes. Through some flashbacks, a boy learns that this world wasn't always this way...it used to be beautiful and green. But mankind's greed destroyed the natural beauty.When I was a kid, I loved the cartoon version of ""The Lorax"". It told a great story AND a great lesson about preserving the environment....and it did it in a fun way that made you listen to the message. Now, decades later, you could see the original...or you could watch this incredibly loud and padded 2012 CGI offering. Loud....big time! Heavy padded? Yep. The original was only 25 minutes...this thing from Universal is nearly 90 minutes and they can't help but overly pad out the story to keep it going this long. The padding consisted of adding a lot of songs...mostly terrible songs...as well as adding side stories that weren't in the cartoon nor Dr. Seuss' book. They also padded it by having countless scenes of the boy riding his motorcyle-like device....all things that really test the patience of folks who actually KNOW and care about the original story. Overall, I hated this film. Despite great CGI and some decent voice acting, the story just was diluted and dull. A huge misfire that is MUCH worse than its current mediocre score. Oh well...at least it wasn't the live action ""Cat in the Hat""!By the way, if you DO watch, note the little bears. They are, essentially, the minions (from the same film studio) just dressed in different garb.",The Lorax
1,TheLittleSongbird,I personally enjoyed it...,7,16 August 2012,"As far as the feature Dr Seuss adaptations go, the best by quite some distance was the animated Horton Hears a Who. The Grinch I also liked, even though it doesn't hold a candle to the 1966 animated version, though I can definitely see why people may dislike it. But I detested Cat in the Hat, a failure both as an adaptation and on its own terms. In all honesty I was very nervous about seeing The Lorax, I'd see anything to do with Dr Seuss but when I saw people likening it to propaganda and the more positive reviews getting overly defensive and condescending and making all kinds of annoying excuses it did lower my expectations. After seeing it, I don't think it was as bad as all that, calling it propaganda I think is unfair, but I don't think it is perfect either. It does pale in comparison to the original story and to the 1972 cartoon, but on its own merits, on which I do think generally a movie should be judged, I found it a perfectly decent movie. Perfect? No, the ""hippy grandma"" character did get on my nerves and the main subplot with Ted could have been better developed. My biggest reservation was that while the story did have its heart and charm it was rather stretched which loses the initial simplicity of the story. However, the animation is wonderful, very bright and whimsical as it should be with some pleasingly psychedelic moments also. The songs are suitably catchy with some deliciously playful lyrics. The writing is much better than I expected, I was expecting the toilet humour and fart jokes of Cat in the Hat but actually the humour is cheerful and amusing. The message is heartfelt and despite what you'd expect reading the plot summary I don't think it talked down to the audience that much. The ending is heartwarming and a nice change from the one of the more downbeat yet hopeful one of the 1972 cartoon. The characters on the whole are likable and personable, the best being the Lorax himself, and the animals are very cute. The voice acting is also fine, Danny DeVito does cranky brilliantly, and Ed Helms and Betty White are also amusing. Zac Efron and Taylor Swift may raise some eyebrows and I was initially perplexed at their casting, but actually both do spirited jobs. So all in all, while I can understand the disappointment of those who didn't like it as much I did enjoy The Lorax despite fears that I wouldn't. 7/10 Bethany Cox",The Lorax
2,SnoopyStyle,heavy handed environmental story,6,31 August 2013,"In the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of his dream girl, Audrey. When he learns of her wish to see a real tree, Ted seeks out the Once-ler, a ruined old businessman outside of town in a stark wasteland.The story is mostly told in flashback after that. It's not a compelling way to tell a story. We're going into the mind of Dr Seuss in this heavy handed environmental story. The voice work is good but Danny Devito's voice is rather distinctive and distracting. While I applaud the effort, I think the story is too dead on, even for kids.",The Lorax
3,nogodnomasters,It's not about what it is. It's about what it can become.,10,24 April 2019,"In the age of Hollywood's seeming endless films aimed against greed, consumerism, and environmental destruction, ""The Lorax"" is not to be outdone. Unlike the other films with hidden messages, this one is very direct. The voice of Danny Devito and Betty White made the film very special as you can see them in those roles. The film incorporates some of the original Dr. Seuss poetry to convey the message, but doesn't bog down the film with it as to lose the target audience who may not enjoy it as much as we did when we read the original first edition hard covers in the third grade.The story is about the Once-ler (what's in a name? Ed Helms) who cuts down all the trees and at times looking like Elton John playing the Pinball Wizard. He did this to make the Thneed (a versatile Huggie) that no one wanted until a pretty girl wore one. Ted Wiggins (Zac Efron) wants to obtain a tree because the pretty redhead Audry (Taylor Swift) wants one. Sort of like Brad Pitt suddenly caring about hungry third world kids. There are musical numbers and numerous messages about consumer marketing, greed, bottled water, and the environment. SNL's Nasim Pedrad did the voice of the Once-ler's mom, reminding me of the grandmother in the old Carol Burnett series.Perhaps the best message of the film is that individuals can make a difference. As an adult I enjoyed the film.",The Lorax
4,kosmasp,Xarol,7,17 September 2012,"If you don't mind that this movie carries a message (a really heavy one at that) and has some song and dance numbers in it (one right up front at the beginning) you will really enjoy this nice little animated comedy. The voice talent at work is really great here. It's awesome to have someone like Danny De Vito back in form.Of course the whole movie is simplified (take a look at the ""villain"" for example), but the jokes do work even for the adults. The 3-D was good too, which could be seen in the trailer too. The story isn't too hard to follow, because as said above this is aimed primarily at a younger audience. Watch it with kids if possible",The Lorax
5,classicsoncall,"""Let's just say I needed a tree, where would I go?""",7,18 March 2012,"It occurs to me there was a missed opportunity here. A perfect musical number that could have been included in the picture was that old Joni Mitchell song 'Big Yellow Taxi', you know, the one where they paved Paradise and put up a parking lot. That song has a line, 'They took all the trees, and put 'em in a tree museum, and they charged the people a dollar and a half to see 'em'. The song has a spirited melody and a message that blends in with the movie's theme, and I thought it would make a pretty good fit.I'm kind of surprised at all the comments I've read on this board and in the reviews that slam the picture for being overtly political in it's anti-capitalist messaging. It says to me that people are finally starting to 'get it' and are beginning to push back against those forces that want to hogtie the economy with stifling rules and regulations. On the flip side, I didn't find the conservation message to be offensive at all, and planting a tree isn't the worst idea to be sending to a kid. So like anything else, there's a balance to be found with just about anything.As for the picture, if I didn't have a couple of grandkids to treat on a Saturday afternoon, I wouldn't have been compelled to see this movie. I liked Dr. Seuss's stuff when I read it as a kid, but The Lorax must have somehow escaped me. It surprised me how little screen time the character actually had in the story, considering he was the wise old 'man' of the tale. Which brings me to another observation. As long as he was drawn to look like Wilford Brimley, why not get Brimley to voice the character. I guess Danny DeVito did a good enough job as The Lorax, but every time I saw the O'Hare guy, I kept thinking DeVito, and that's without even knowing who the voice actors were to begin with.Story wise, I was kind of ho-hum about it all. It was certainly colorful enough, and as a kids movie I think it works OK. I found myself chuckling at the same times in the picture as the youngsters in the theater at the time, which was a considerable number. Those mostly involved the cute little animal characters like the fish and the bear cubs without remembering any lines in particular. If anything, what I think I might do now is go out and look up the source material, that is, the original Dr. Seuss story. Nothing like the original as they say.",The Lorax
6,jboothmillard,The Lorax,6,10 February 2013,"This was only the fourth of the famous books, long and short, by Dr. Suess to be made into a full length feature film, and only the second after Horton Hears a Who! to be animated, I didn't know much about the story at all, but I think I did recognise the title character, so I looked forward to watching it. Basically the city of Thneed-Ville is walled and everything is artificial, so there are no real plants or trees, and the air is a commodity as well and the residents pay for it to the greedy Mayor Aloysius O'Hare (Rob Riggle). Twelve year old Ted (Zac Efron) is one of the residents of the city, he one of the only people who questions why there are no real trees, and to win the heart of his dream girl Audrey (singer Taylor Swift) he is breaking the law by leaping over the wall of the city and seeking someone called The Once-ler (The Hangover's Ed Helms). He eventually finds the house on the outskirts, the outside of the city is a baron wasteland with thousands of stumps that used to be trees, the unseen hermit-like Once-ler at first refuses to tell the story of why there are no real trees anymore, but the second time he tells what happened. Seen in flashback, the Once-ler was once a young man with a dream to be successful, and after chopping down a tree he meets the magical creature called The Lorax (Danny DeVito), he explains that the trees are needed for life to go on as normal, especially for the environment. When the Once-ler discovers that the trees of the city have a valuable material growing on them that can be turned into a money making material, Thneed, and he ignores the Lorax's warning not to cut down any more trees so that he can become rich businessman. The Lorax protests as much as he can about the tree situation, but the Once-ler has become so successful that he does not care about anything else, not seeing how taking all the trees will change anything, but once the last tree has been chopped down he cannot make any more money, and the air has become thin and contaminated. Back in the present day, the Once-ler knows that it was his fault that the city is in the state its in now, and that air is no longer free because the trees are what helped make it, so Ted now not just wants to find a tree to impress Audrey, but it is needed to save the environment. Ted manages to find the last seed in the city that will grow into a tree if planted into the ground beneath the concrete, the authorities under the orders of greedy Mayor O'Hare try to stop him, but his grandmother Grammy Norma (Betty White) helps. In the end, the Mayor, who wants to continuing making his money exploiting the state of the bad air, tries to convince everyone that the tree should not be planted, but Ted pleads his case that they are needed for the environment, and the Lorax is happy to see Thneed-Ville can start to go back to normal. Also starring Jenny Slate as Ted's Mom, Nasim Pedrad as Once-ler's Mom, Elmarie Wendel as Aunt Grizelda and Stephen Tobolowsky as Uncle Ubb. The voice casting is very well chosen, DeVito is suitably grouchy when he needs to be but also affectionately wise, Helms is good as the one who ruins the environmental situation, and the supporting cast members are likable as well. The story is an extended version of the short story that not many people know from the writer, in the original story the Once-ler is not seen as well which is interesting, it works as both a message about the environment in the world, the computer animation is really terrific, and it has a good amount of laughs and fun for everyone, a fun family animated comedy adventure. Good!",The Lorax
7,tavm,"This feature-length, computer-animated version of Dr. Seuss' The Lorax is worthwhile if you don't mind the creative additions",7,15 March 2012,"Just watched this computer-animated Dr. Seuss adaptation with my movie theatre-working friend just now. It's an expansion of the tale he wrote and drew in the early '70s as well as of an about 30 minute drawn animated special made during the same period. The message is the same: The title character, voiced by Danny DeVito, speaks for the trees when The Once-ler, Ed Helms, chops them down in order to have materials for...well, okay in order to expand the story there were some changes. And the boy, who in the original was just curious of what happened, now has a girl he has a crush on he wants to impress. And there are musical numbers to boot! For a while, I wasn't too enthused by what I saw but eventually I warmed to what was going on as the message of the environment worth saving was still there and it was soooo heartwarming to see how the public turn against that Corporate Villain that was added and there were many cool POV shots during the chases and the 3-D was awesome...All right, so in summary, if you don't mind the additions, this version of Dr. Seuss' The Lorax was quite enjoyable for what it was and seeing how things turned out also made this a worthy feature. Still, there's still the book and the first filmed version to recommend if you prefer the much shorter versions...",The Lorax
8,michaelRokeefe,Not a good reflection on Dr. Seuss.,2,8 March 2012,"Screenplay writers Cinco Paul and Ken Daurio adapt Dr. Seuss's book The Lorax about a grumpy forest creature, who isn't quite ready to share his world of brightly colored fuzzy trees. The creators of DESPICABLE ME takes a header with this CGI and 3D feature. Animated films like this one rely on the vocal talents of its stars. Diverse stars sometimes bring life to enjoyable looking scenes. And sometimes you have a whirl of pretty cinematography going nowhere. You decide. Twelve year old Ted(Zac Efron)is wanting to impress the sweetheart of his dreams Audrey(Taylor Swift)by presenting her with her heart's desire...a tree. In the process Ted will meet up with The Lorax(Danny DeVito), the keeper of the only trees, and exchange thoughts of hope, love and promise. Miss Betty White is wasted giving voice to Ted's Grammy Norma. DeVito at least probably earned his paycheck. Efron is as interesting as plaster. Swift was sweet enough. When I viewed THE LORAX, the only real reactions I noticed came from the ""pull-up diaper set"". I would imagine Dr. Seuss might be a little disappointed too.",The Lorax
9,grantss,Style over substance,3,4 March 2020,Another modern style-over-substance movie. Good CGI but weak plot and dialogue. Dull.Kids will enjoy it though.,The Lorax
10,Boba_Fett1138,"Great in some ways, not so great in others.",6,13 March 2012,"In some ways this movie was much better than expected, while at others this movie still remained a rather weak and disappointing one. At times I was really liking the movie, while at others it would be doing something that completely took me out of it.The one things I was especially worried about, beforehand, were its visuals. It was far too colorful and cartoon-like/childish for my taste but as it turned out, the visuals was the foremost thing that still made me like the movie. I really liked its style, that beside suited the movie its face pace and the very unique and distinctive looking Dr. Seuss characters.So nothing wrong with the character design and overall visual style of the movie. Also little wrong with comedy. I admit that I laughed more than a couple of times. It's nothing too original but it's getting done and told in an effective way. Especially (young) children will love it, also of course for its bright colors and very imaginative surroundings and characters.Than what was my problem with this movie? Well, unfortunately its story. I don't know but every time I thought that the movie would be doing something good and interesting it started to head into a totally different direction again. It's as if this movie had plenty of ideas and intentions with its story but didn't had the time or budget to effectively finish it all and incorporate it all into the movie. The movie is quite short and who knows, maybe an extra 20 minutes would had done wonders for it and its story.But it's also a bit due to the Lorax himself that the movie its story doesn't always work out. After watching this movie, I still don't know anything about the Lorax, about who he was and what his purpose was. He also isn't really being the main character of the movie and perhaps only is the second or third most important one in its story. But perhaps also my expectations for him were a bit wrong. I was expecting a grumpy and evil Grinch like character, especially after I found out he was getting voiced by Danny DeVito. But the Lorax is being an overall good guy, with always the best intentions. In other words, not all that interesting at all!The thing I also didn't really liked about the story was that it was basically being 2 stories in one. It was telling a story in flashbacks and then there was also still a story, getting told in the present time. To be fair I was only interested in the story out of the flashbacks and I wouldn't had minded at all if the other story got completely left out of it. That way the movie would also had some more focus in it, instead of jumping all over the place constantly with its story.Seriously, the movie was quite good and enjoyable but its weaknesses and inconsistencies still make this a far from great movie. Not that young children would mind much though. This is still a pretty good and entertaining animated movie for them to watch!6/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",The Lorax
11,neil-476,Chopping down trees is bad. Who knew?,7,10 August 2012,"The Lorax, based on Dr Seuss' book of the same name, tells two stories - one about a young man who wants to plant a tree to impress a pretty girl (in a world where trees are a thing of the past) and another, in flashback, about how the trees were destroyed in the first place. It does this in very colourful CGI.As an ageing Brit, Dr Seuss and I have only a passing acquaintance - his stuff is not widely disseminated in the UK and, what I have seen, I don't care for. I get it, I just don't like it very much. My expectation for this movie was that I would receive it in the same way and, to some extent, my preconceptions were born out.But I'm probably not being completely fair, because there is good stuff in this film. As expected, the design, animation and voice talent is all first rate. There are some good gags, some decent songs, and some fun action - it is a perfectly serviceably family movie and, if you are 6, you're probably going to love it.If you're 60, maybe not so much. I suspect, like me, you will already know that it's not a good thing to chop down all the trees (whether or not you put 'em in a tree museum, thank you Joni Mitchell for making the same point 40 years ago). And, if you already know that, then you're probably not going to get too much enjoyment out of this movie beating you over the head with that point courtesy of a fluorescent multi-coloured hammer for an hour and a half. I didn't.",The Lorax
12,anaconda-40658,Save the Trees!,7,18 May 2015,"The Lorax (2012): Dir: Chris Renaud, Kyle Balda / Voices: Danny De Vito, Zac Efron, Ed Helms, Taylor Swift, Rob Riggle: A stunning animation that represents those of us concerned with our environment and the state of our world through greed and carelessness. Zac Efron voices Ted Wiggins who wishes to impress Audrey, a female he crushes on. She desires to see a real living tree. Their town has become one plastic landscape with one great joke regarding a villain who sells bottled air since the trees have pretty much been vanquished. Despite cameras being everywhere he manages to escape to the wilderness where he hears of the destructive past from a being who calls himself the Once-ler who regrets actions that have led to the dead scenery around him. He was warned by the mystical Lorax who overlooks the forest. While the concept is appealing, the screenplay is reduced to formula and a climax that viewers will likely see planted long before the seed drops. The appeal lies within creative images of bears, birds, singing fish that scamper on land, as well as marshmallows that descend everywhere. Besides Ted becoming part of a bigger picture, there is Ed Helms voicing the regrets of the Once-ler. Taylor Swift is given the cardboard role of Audrey. Danny De Vito steals the film as the orange oval shaped Lorax who sports wisdom, wit and a thick yellow moustache. Rob Riggle can be funny but voicing the mayor is hardly a great opportunity to showcase his comic potential. Family friendly animation with dazzling comic images and a message of warning when it comes to our trees. Score: 7 ½ / 10",The Lorax
13,FlashCallahan,That's a woman?....,5,21 July 2012,"In the town of Thneedville, a walled city, everything is artificial even the trees. And the air is provided by the O'Hare Corporation for a price. Ted, a young man who likes a girl named Audrey, wants to see a real tree. And thinking that if he can find it will win her affections. He is told to seek out someone called The Once-ler, who tells Ted what happened to all the tress and that it began when he wanted to create something he called Thneed. He comes across a forest with trees with the most beautiful leaves and he chops a tree down, but then The Lorax who says he speaks for the trees tells Ted chopping down a tree is wrong. But he ignores The Lorax.....The film is quite stunning to look at, but sometimes the preaching can get a little bit too much, despite the best intentions of the cast and the animators.I think we all know, even kids my daughters age, know that killing wildlife is a bad thing, and mentioning it once in the film is fair enough. But the fact that it's rammed down out throat almost every ten minutes, really grates, and then there are the songs, which basically say, save the trees, save the trees!!!If the makers were any less subtle about their message, they would have had Zac Efron pop up subliminally every ten minutes holding a sign reading 'plant more trees!, love mother earth' My daughter enjoyed it though, and that was really the main thing, but it would be nice for the makers to appreciate the adults, not reference Despicable me, and play a song during the final that sounds like an X-factor winners song.I would have rather have spent my money on planting a tree.",The Lorax
14,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: The Lorax,6,4 March 2012,"Dr Seuss' stories for children have been finding their way to the big screen, be it live action or animated variants. The Lorax becomes the first to be presented in IMAX 3D, although frankly speaking having watched this in the 2D version, there aren't that many clues why it would have warranted a 3D treatment given a rather flat animated design that won't contribute much to the 3D format, although having presented in IMAX would mean a crisp presentation, with the musical elements likely to have pushed the song and dance sequence into aural and visual perfection given the vibrant colours involved.Given that it's a kid's film, director Chris Renaud clearly has brought his Despicable Me know how into The Lorax, knowing just what buttons to push to keep the young ones engaged and entertained. With his earlier animated effort, even the most bored adult in the audience would find the little yellow minions in the film fairly amusing with their antics, and here with co- direction by Kyle Balda, that responsibility fell onto the many strange animals in the land of Thneed-Ville before it became polluted and uninhabitable. There are many of cute, furry bears running around the landscape filled with the Truffula trees, which serve up delicacies for the animals, and who can forget the singing/humming fishes out of water who are primarily key to why the musical numbers were plenty of fun. Or the birds of the land as well, way before the introduction of the very grumpy Lorax, protector of the trees when Once-ler (Ed Helms) fell one of them to extract raw material for his production of Thneed, a multi- purpose fabric.It's a story within a story, which began with Ted (Zac Efron) having the hots for Audrey (Taylor Swift), who has a penchant for wanting to see a real tree. Living in Thneed-Ville where everything is artificial, Ted discovers the simplest way to score with his lady love is to make her sole dream come true, but requires to do the forbidden and step outside their gated community, and seek out the fabled Once-ler, as advised by his grandma (Betty White). So begins the actual story of The Lorax with the background of how the Once-ler ended up where he is, from a promising young man seeking his fortunes to learning the universal lesson of how to take care of our only planet, told through multiple visits that Ted makes each time to learn a lot more.The story's pretty much very point blank in its obvious message about the environment, and conservation, where the ill effects of industrialization, blatant pollution and the destruction of nature get dealt with in the narrative – when natural habitats are destroyed, those oh-so-cute all-singing-and-dancing animals will soon have to depart or face extinction. However, having this shoved down your throat every now and then does become somewhat of a put off. While the young ones will likely be entertained, accompanying adults will likely stay two steps ahead of the story since it doesn't toss up any surprises, and you can be accurately guessing how everything turned out like it is for Thneed-Ville given the very lively introduction to the town.The villain is of course the conglomerate head Mr O'Hare (Rob Riggle) whose objective is sky rocketing profits from a self fulfilling cycle of production and waste, churning out products such as filters and bottled clean air to serve as growing necessities for the town's inhabitants. Despite getting title billing, the Lorax (voiced by Danny DeVito) isn't that much well liked or have taken centre-stage, despite having to crack some one-liners every now and then, but character wise, almost everything stuck to their assigned caricature. This makes the narrative a little bit bland and boring, unable to keep pace with its punchier song and dance moments when it played out more like a musical.Fans of Despicable Me will find some grounds for familiarity given how director Renaud stuck to his formula of packing the visuals in with bright, vibrant colours, and staffed full of cutesy animals and creatures that Once-ler finds himself in the company of. It's a story about redemption after betrayal of the highest order, breaking that circle of trust in the name of production and capitalism, and sort of reflects a current state in modern society with morals thrown out the window in exchange for riches. But for the young ones who are here to watch this show, parents beware, should there be a slew of merchandise and toys lined up to capture their attention post-screening.",The Lorax
15,siderite,I can't help feeling offended by the idea that someone thinks children are this dumb,5,16 February 2013,"This is a movie for children, as evidenced by the lazy CGI graphic, the moronic or ridiculously exaggerated facial expressions, the occasional bouts of singing in the middle of the plot and, of course, all the dumb clichés of our times! Let me enumerate some of them: Nature is good, technology is evil. Children and grandmothers are ""cool"" while working parents are not so. Business men and the economic ideas in general are evil (this much is true, but still...). Good people are smart and lively, bad people are idiots. Anything fluffy is good, too. I could go on and on.The bottom line is that this is a film for three year olds or something like that, and maybe they would enjoy it. I, however, feel that children must be smarter than this, so my inner child can't help but feel offended by this soulless and dumbing monstrosity.",The Lorax
16,StevePulaski,"Not Liberal propaganda, not an unforgettable extravaganza - a fun and simple story with a fair amount of glory",8,11 March 2012,"Dr Seuss' novel, The Lorax, has never gotten its deserved time on the big screen. It was made into a TV special in 1972 for CBS, and now, it has been adapted to the big screen boasting a candy-colored atmosphere and probably the cutest little creature in a blue moon. I've always stated that The Lorax was the one Dr. Seuss novel, I felt, no one really paid attention to. It was one of my favorites growing up, and the special and the character will always have a reserved place in my heart.This is the second Dr. Seuss film to be transferred to the big screen using full computer animation, with the first being Horton Hears a Who! a few years back. The ideas, tools, and mindset to make Dr. Seuss' The Lorax into a marvelously unforgettable film are here, but a lot of the fun appears to be sucked out to replace it with utter seriousness. It seems the writers focused a bit too much on morals and forgot that while The Lorax was a tad dark, it was also a bit fun and simple.The film centers around Ted (voiced by Zac Efron) a smart and plucky youngster who lives in the town of Thneed-ville. The town is mostly occupied by plastic trees, hard ground, and goofy characters who seem to break out in song whenever they can. Ted desperately wants to win the heart of Audrey (Swift), a girl who wishes trees, called Truffulas, which appear to be lanky sticks with cotton candy on the top, would come back and inhabit the town to brighten it up with colors and attractiveness.Ted learns from his grandmother (White) that there is a man named The Once-ler (Helms) who lives in a land far outside of Thneed-ville. The townspeople have been sheltered off from the outside world long enough to think they're somehow the only neighborhood in the world. Ted runs off to find The Once-ler, who has chosen to reside in a rundown shack and become a hermit after a failed invention proved to bring nothing but shame to him and the large forest.The Once-ler created Thneeds, which were made out of Truffula tree fluff. Thneeds could be made into anything from scarfs to stylish hats. The only problem was in order to make these Thneeds, The Once-ler had to chop down many trees in the forest. The story of his invention is told in flashback and this is where we meet The Lorax (DeVito) the quick-witted, cute-as-a-button character who ""speaks for the trees."" The Lorax seems small and powerless, but winds up giving The Once-ler a grand lesson he can take to his grave.While some of this seems a bit heavy-handed, the film is very enjoyable and pleasant. The musical numbers are energetic and fun, the forest characters are simply whimsical and precious, while the humans are a tad dull, and the whole narrative progresses rather quickly and, most of the time, remains upbeat and lively.This is a cute film, but I think the idea of environmentalism in the film needs to be addressed. I'm speaking not as a Liberal who believes in the strict over-protection of our wildlife, nor do I speak as a Conservative who believes we have bigger problems - I speak as a frequent moviegoer who likes to be immersed in a film and not lectured by it. This is where the heavy-handed, oppressive part I was talking about comes in. The end features an enormous musical number about letting plants and trees grow rather than preventing them from sprouting. At the end, it almost feels like the film was just giving us a presentable lecture on wildlife rather than guiding us through the events casually leading up to this moral. For that reason, the film was a bit aggravating, but nonetheless enjoyable, although I can't say I wanted to race out of the theater to plant a tree afterwards.I believe too many people are seeing this as a political film. Yes, the fact that Hollywood is very Democratic may have played a bit of a role in getting this film made, but I believe it was more or less the idea of giving the Dr. Seuss book that never had a film its long overdue treatment. Granted Seuss was a big environmentalist, and at the time that was strange and a bit unheard of, but the idea has grown a lot more today, and the film fits in nicely with today's audience.There is an immense difference between kids films and family films and Dr. Seuss' The Lorax is a family film. The message works on both levels, the jokes possess strong enough wit with they can be endured by both the parents and the children without trouble (although there might be a tiny bit of manipulation), and once more, The Lorax character is charmingly irresistible even if he is shoved a bit further into the background.

17,KineticSeoul,Meaningful animated movie but has it's flaws,6,3 March 2012,"I got exactly what I thought I was gonna get out of this movie from the trailer and for the most part that was a good thing. The story in this is good and meaningful considering it's from a Dr. Seuss book. The plot is about this boy who lives in a town where just about everything is made of plastic and there is no natural vegetation or plants. But wants to impress a girl that he likes so he goes on a journey to find a tree cause that girl wants to see a real tree. And thus it goes from the back story of what happened to the trees and back. Although the trees in this looks more like cotton candy on a stick rather than a actual tree. But than again it's a Dr. Seuss world. The message in this movie was more inspiring than it being forced in your face and will keep some audience think and maybe get something out of this flick. However the movie does have some flaws, it just wasn't engaging as I wanted it to be. Which is disappointing cause I wanted to like this movie. And it loses interest as the movie progresses even more and the movie just lacked character. Although it felt meaningful it just wasn't all that entertaining or grabbed my interest. It's a good family flick though.6.7/10",The Lorax
18,sddavis63,Let It Grow!,5,28 September 2012,"The animation is great, there are some fun songs, the story is important and - aside from really, really hard core conservatives - nobody could really argue with the environmental message the movie contains. I do wonder, though, if the message isn't perhaps a little too hard sell, in your face. ""The Lorax"" is obviously based on the Dr. Seuss book of the same name. The basic message is the same, which probably would have pleased Theodor Geisel (the real name of Dr. Seuss.) It's about a boy named Ted, who lives in an artificial town where everything (including the grass and the trees) is made of plastic and everything is very polluted. Ted finally discovers what happened to ""real"" nature when he encounters the ""Once-Ler.""Whether Geisel would have been pleased with the changes to the story or not? Who knows. If it got the same message across, he probably wouldn't have objected too much. The major change is around the character of the Once-Ler. In the book, the Once-Ler is a somewhat scary character, largely unseen, representing the abuses of big business. Here, the Once- Ler is a human, less a critique of big business and more a reflection on basic human greed and how it can take over our lives before we realize what the consequences will be. There were also a lot of new characters introduced, the most significant being the notorious fresh air merchant O'Hare, and Ted's grandmother. I didn't think the changes to the story were problematic, although O'Hare perhaps was a little too much, and took the focus off of the Once-Ler's story.I still thought that the in your face nature of the environmental message might have been lost on younger kids who will watch this. They'll watch it more for the cute teddy bear like characters and the humming fish we encounter as the Once-Ler begins his story. As an adult, I got the message, but I still thought it might have been overdone. It's not bad, but I thought it a bit too heavy for kids and for me, although I got the message, I can't say I was enthralled by the movie. (5/10)",The Lorax
19,Hellmant,Strong parallels in the story with the world's current battle to legalize marijuana!,6,15 May 2012,"'DR. SEUSS' THE LORAX': Three Stars (Out of Five) Another feature film adaptation of a classic Dr. Seuss children's book, this one being 'The Lorax'. Like 2008's 'HORTON HEARS A WHO!' film adaptation the entire thing is computer-animated. It was directed by Chris Renaud (who also directed 'DESPICABLE ME') and Kyle Balda and written by Ken Daurio. It tells the story of a boy living in a completely artificial town in search of a real tree (which no longer exist) in order to impress a girl. I like the original Dr. Seuss story but once again much of it's magic is lost by stretching it in to a feature length film.Zac Efron voices Ted, the 12-year-old boy determined to find a real tree to impress the girl, Audrey (Taylor Swift), he's crushing on. The two live in the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where everything is fake and air is a much desired resource. Ted journeys outside the walls of the city in order to find a tree and meets the Once-ler (Ed Helms), who is responsible for doing away with all the land's trees (for business). Ted also meets the creature known as the Lorax (Danny Devito), who's job it is to protect the nature of the land.Like all the Dr. Seuss film adaptations the movie is just too long and was better as a 22 minute animated short. Still it has a lot of heart and has a great message. I actually found strong parallels in the story with the world's current battle to legalize marijuana. Trees, like marijuana, are an essential and valuable resource that in the film has been outlawed in order for big business to make money (much like marijuana in reality). It's a good message to deliver to our children and adults alike but making a full blown big budget feature presentation of it kind of turns it in to the thing it's preaching against!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNk88XWi4A4",The Lorax
20,cherold,"Entertaining, although lacks the beautiful simplicity of the book",7,25 January 2014,"When I was a kid, Dr. Suess books were turned into half-hour animated specials that slavishly copied the look of the books and kept the original text, just adding some gags here and there to expand the story. These cartoons were absolutely wonderful (you've probably at least seen the most famous of them - How the Grinch Stole Christmas), and were the perfect vehicle to bring the books to life. A feature-length film, on the other hand, is inherently going to weaken the story. Still, going into the movie fully conscious that there would be problems, I found myself able to get a good deal of enjoyment out of it.First off, the animation is terrific. Even though computer animation can't recreate the Suess look the way the old specials did, it comes pretty close at keeping the design and fleshing it out realistically. This is particularly true of the trufula trees, which are just gorgeous.The movie also has a lot of great individual scenes, like a bed-rafting excursion, that are so entertaining and funny that it makes the overall movie quite enjoyable.The story consists of two parts, a boy's search for a tree, and a flashback about why the world has no trees. The latter part is based on the book.The book part expands the story of the Once-ler and softens the character a bit. Now he is given motivation beyond greed and we see his first interactions with the world and the Lorax in greater detail. Oddly enough though, the part where the forest is actually destroyed is contracted into a single song (a pretty good one, though).With Once-ler made more complex, the role of villain goes to Mr. O'Hare, who sells air in a town made entirely of plastic in the movie's other part, which is modern and rather disjointed but generally entertaining.Those critics here who say the movie hits the audience over the head with its environmentalist message must not have read the book, which is nothing but one big, brilliant hammer blow to polluters. I would say that, in fact, the environmental message is less powerful, with the film focused a little more on the general sin of corporate greed. Ultimately that makes it less effective than the book. The book had a strong message: this is the problem, and if you - yes you - don't do something about it, we're doomed. The movie has more of the modern cynicism about big corporations that can make it feel that this sort of thing is such a part of life that the situation is hopeless (even though that is not, of course, the message of the movie). The movie doesn't hold a candle to the old animated special - Danny Devito's construction-worker accent fits the character less than Eddie Albert's impassioned voice, and the movie's pace is inconsistent - but it is fun.",The Lorax

22,g-bodyl,"Great, Fun Film!",9,12 November 2013,"The Lorax is a fun, delightful animation that is based off the wonderful children's book by Dr. Seuss, ""The Lorax."" Despite some stuffy environmental themes that seem to have a goal of being shoved down the audience's throat, the story is well-translated to the big screen and the animation is bright and joyous. Plus not to mention that there are some wonderful sing-a-long tunes to tap your toes too.This film is about a guy named Ted who is a resident of Thneedville. In order to impress some girl named Audrey, he wants to find a tree to grow. He visits the Once-ler and if he wants to get a tree, he must listen to the story of the Once-ler and his meetings with the Lorax, guardian of the forest.The voice-acting is pretty good. Danny DeVito is the perfect guy to voice the Lorax. Despite my indifference for Zac Efron and Taylor Swift, I think they did okay here. This movie also proves that despite many years of television/movie acting, Betty White still sounds golden through animation.Overall, this is a fun animated movie. I had a blast with the film especially during the musical numbers.

26,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews...,4,8 August 2012,"The LoraxThankfully, my lorax was removed when I was a child so there's no chance of my neck exploding.Oops! This isn't a movie about that volatile organ in the human throat but an animated feature regarding a numinous creature.Set in a self-contained community littered with artificial foliage, a young denizen (Zac Efron) sets out to find a real tree to impress a girl (Taylor Swift) he has a crush on.On the counsel of his grandmother (Betty White) he seeks out a hermit (Ed Helms) beyond Thneed-Ville's fortified walls.According to legend, this solitudinarian knows the truth about the trees, and their magical protector: The Lorax (Danny DeVito).Based on the book by Dr. Seuss, The Lorax lacks its author's eccentric exuberance.

27,ironhorse_iv,"Once-ler upon a time, there was a good movie version of the Lorax & this movie wasn't it.",6,15 October 2015,"That honor goes to the wonderful made, 1972 animated musical television special; in which, this movie was remade from. I think, the reason why, I ponder this way, is because the 2012's version has an over-saturation amount of consumerist-tie-ins. There are, at least, 70 different marketing promotions here! This marketing ploy really does betrayed, the original conservation and protecting the environment message of the Dr. Seuss's children's book of the same name, in which the movies were based on. For an anti-materialism story to advertise so many products to kids and their parents; it sends a particularly confusing message. Yes, kids might want to leave the film wanting to do more to help nature, however; that message will be diluted by the onslaught of available merchandise with the Lorax's brand. Directed by Chris Renaud & Kyle Balda, and released by Universal Pictures on March 2, 2012, the 108th birthday of Dr. Seuss. The movie tells the story of a young boy named Ted (Voiced by Zac Efton) living in the town of Thneedville; a place, where nothing grows. When his girl crush, Audrey (Voiced by Taylor Swift) wish to see a real tree, he sets out to find one for her, with the help of the reclusive Once-ler (Voiced by Ed Helms) and the once-strong, forest guardian, the Lorax (Voiced by Danny DeVito). Can Ted find a tree or has the final tree, already been cut down? Watch the movie to find out, if you want to! Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to say, the story of the Once-ler interaction with the Lorax, is far more superior, than, the expanded story of Ted trying to get a tree. I really didn't like, any of the new stuff that they added to push, the film's runtime more. The whole subplot of Ted's tree rescue, being threaten by the new town's bigwig, Mr. O'Hare (Voiced by Rob Riggle), because trees provide oxygen is somewhat confusing. Yes, it makes sense that he would try to stop it, since his profits come from the manufactured air that the citizens have been taught to buy and breathe. However, the movie never explains, how he gets his bottles of clear air. Nor, does it, explain, how the people of Thneedville are able to survived, in such a desolate wasteland with no trees. No trees mean no food, water or oxygen! You would think, these people would be gasping for air, or suffocating, by now. For all we know, there is no natural source. The real problem I had with this adaptation, is how little, does things like this, seem logical. Another thing that seem illogical, is the over the top eco-villain. You would think, Mr. O'Hare would rather steal the tree, than try to destroy it. However, wouldn't it, be better if they weren't any villains. Isn't the idea of The Lorax, is to tell a cautionary tale of when someone, anyone, takes too much without realizing it. That anybody, can, end up like the Once-ler. I guess, the producers didn't want people to feel bad about themselves. So, they create a clean cut unrealistic villain, instead. The writers should had, kept the Once-ler, the only antagonist, tragic figure and should had kept him, hidden. After all, he's supposed to represent us. Still, I do, like, how they made the character, into a sympathetic human character than monster, but the way, they show it was kinda rushed and underdeveloped. In the film, he's really only cutting down trees by pressure from his family who aren't sympathetic in the least, until the ""How Bad Can I Be"" number, where he becomes consumed by the greed and its capitalism way. However, in the 1972 animated special, he's not outright bad, but have a multifarious view when it comes to production. The movie gives him, a lot more time to debate his actions, and always finding an excuse to cut more and more trees, because he fears people would lose their jobs. It made the film, so much more complex. I hate the fact, that this movie makes the issue, seem simple, when it isn't. One of the biggest complains, I have, about both movies is, how the Once-ler, not once, try to fix his own mistake. If the goal of the movie was to promote environmentalism, the Once-ler should have done, something, but, instead, he waits for someone else to come along and fix it. What kind of message, is that? Are we supposed to be shameful of our misdeeds and hope that the next generation can do something better about it? That's a crappy ending. This 2012 film kinda make it, worst. I really didn't like, the force pandering happy ending in this. I would rather take the original powerfully thought-provoking, emotionally fueled, and subtly ambiguous bittersweet ending over this, any day. That said, The Lorax isn't a bad movie. It's certainly not painful to watch, but it's not all that fun either. The jokes were mostly a miss than a hit. I didn't like the pop-culture references, nor the music and songs in the film. They weren't that memorable. While, the animation was mostly alright; it's seem to borrow, a lot from 2010's Despicable Me. I really didn't like, how the forest animals act like minions. Last is the awkward voice-acting. The voice actors they chose for this film, doesn't really do much for the characters. The worst had to be, the then-21 year old, Zac Efron as a 12 year-old boy & the then-38 Ed Helms voicing a young 20 year-old hipster, Once-ler. They sound, nothing like, the age, they're supposed to be portraying. However, Danny DeVito was a great choice for the Lorax. I just wish, the producers didn't have him, try to kill the Once-ler. Overall: Though, it's not as bad as the live-action versions of Dr. Seuss's books, the Lorax is still a mess of a film. You're better off, revisiting the book, instead.",The Lorax

29,TheMovieDiorama,The Lorax thneedn't have shoved its colourful environmentalist message so brutally.,3,26 October 2019,"Well, the live-action 'Cat in the Hat' adaptation was a *cough* massive success *cough* so it was only a matter of years before another Dr Seuss family-friendly book would have its zany vivid world transferred onto the medium of film. Then comes the introductory title screen. A despicable minion pops up next to the bold cancerous studio name ""Illumination"", and instantly all hope was diminished.Aside from their initial franchise, they seem to be unable to create animated flicks without treating the audience like simplistic Neanderthals, and The Lorax takes the biscuit. Patience was running thin just from the introductory musical number alone. A young boy journeys outside the walled plastic city of Thneedville to find a living tree so that he can impress a girl, but soon relives a tale that would change his way of life.This is a mess. Perhaps unadaptable due to Seuss' imaginative wordplay that inspiringly illustrates a creative warning against corporate greed and destructive deforestation. Illumination on the other hand, whilst consistently producing colourful and vibrant animations, shoved the morality down the throats of its audience. Within two minutes, the civilians are singing about their perfect plastic bubble and capitalistic functionality. The main character, not the titular creature, has yet to be seen. A Kim Jong-Un lookalike imprisoning his people in a miniature North Korean world fuelled by propaganda. Taylor Swift refusing to sing any of the forgettable songs. And an underdeveloped insight into consumerism by showing one advertisement for canned air.Then the narrative shifts to flashback mode when ""The Once-ler"" retells his past mistakes. That being the termination of candy floss trees to manufacture his new invention. High-pitched carps, who clearly watched 'Alvin and the Chipmunks', irritate with forced pop culture humour. Cuddly cubs scratching their hairy walnuts on display and devouring slabs of butter. Finally, the spirit of the trees gracefully descends from the clouds by awkwardly hoisting his orange derrière in your face. The Lorax.Danny ""Rule Number 95 Kid, Concentrate!"" DeVito. A legend if I'm being honest, but terribly mismatched with the moustached beast. In fact, all of the voice acting was generic and forgettable, never truly matching the wide mouths of its unmemorable characters. The, what is essentially two narrative strands, inadvertently produced an underdeveloped arc that had sole intentions on pushing its well-intentioned morals instead of genuine character development and emotionality.Illumination aren't known for their subtle storytelling, and it's evident in this adaptation. Aside from 'Hop' (which we shan't talk about ever again...), this is by far their weakest mess. Understandably I'm not the target demographic, but children will only be hypnotised by the entrancing colours. I guarantee they shan't remember it after a few days. What a thneed-fest!",The Lorax

31,dfranzen70,The Lorax speaks for the me,8,24 January 2013,"If you're as tall as an adult's knees, then you should like The Lorax, who speaks for the trees. Although it follows a tried-and-true formula, this is a film worth watching with your wee ones - or even by yourself. Sure, you can write it off as another eco-fascist brainwash experiment, but you'd be wrong to do that. Yes, this film has a message - save the trees, save yourselves - but it's whimsical, mirthful fun, too.Ted (Zac Efron) is a young denizen in a city that's completely devoid of plant life, including dirt. Oh, there are flowers and shrubs, but they're plastic. And the big commodity that everyone buys isn't bottled water, it's bottled air. Because there are no plants to photosynthesize, you see. Ted has eyes for a beautiful-and-approachable Audrey (Taylor Swift), who confides to Ted that the one thing she wants in the whole world is, of all things, a tree. She's apparently read about them. Eager to impress, Ted asks his mother, who thinks the idea of dirty, smelly plants is just hideous, but Ted's Grammy (Betty White) knows where to find the tree - Ted must venture outside of the walled city and seek out the Once-ler.When we do meet the Once-ler, we learn why he is alone in a ramshackle home and why there are no trees around him, just stumps, as he relates his fantastic tale to Ted over the course of a few days. A few days is enough for the head honcho in town, Mr. O'Hare (Rob Riggle) learns of Ted's exploits and tries to strong-arm him out of visiting the Once-ler. Well, this is a kids' movie, so you can guess how that goes.The Once-ler relates that he had set out to seek his fortune despite the lack of support from his family. He was convinced that there was a plant material out in the world that was so soft and capable of so many uses that if he could find it and harvest it, why, he'd be a success. He finds a huge forest of trees and chops one down, and then and there is when and where we meet The Lorax (Danny DeVito) himself. The Lorax explains that cutting down the trees is a bad, bad thing, that all of the creatures living in and around them would suffer great harm if the trees were to vanish. The Once-ler agrees to cut down but the one tree, but as you can guess, when he gets the leaves, woven into a Seussian fabric, back to town, they're a hit. And there go the Once-ler's principles. He breaks his deal.The dynamics and plot of the movie are not unlike Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs - crazy inventor whom no one believes in does invent something useful, but at a cost - but it's the whimsy, straight from the imagination of the Good Doctor himself, that make this one a little more entertaining. It's a completely animated film - no live-action junk here, that's for sure - and the settings are direct from the pages of the book itself. Seuss's world is imaginatively realized by directors Chris Renaud and Kyle Balda, not to mention a top-flight animation crew at Universal Pictures (really). If you're wondering whether to take your tyke to this movie, don't wonder. Of course you should. It's a fun movie that even you - yes, you - will enjoy. It has all of the spirit of Dr. Seuss's books and the pretty animation to make it come alive.

It may even be one of the most pertinent ecological movies ever for how it hits home how ecological problems have their roots in the economic system. So it's a really great message., hitting it home with the idea of bottled air. Robert Tressall used a similar thought experiment in ""The Ragged Trousered Philanthropists"" but without even having an ecological edge, it was strictly in his critique of capitalism which to me shows how we need to just put these two things together in our minds: ecology and economy.I know I'm waxing philosophical here but that's what this movie means to me.

But that only lasts briefly.As the Once-Ler tries to get his family to get on board the business and chopping down the trees.

The animals and the Lorax leaves. And he becomes a recluse.Out of all the people that believe in Ted, only his loving grandmother believes in him. As she encourages him to seek out the Once-Ler and also to show the city's residence the biggest secret of that forbidden but polluted land.The Once-Ler does give Ted hope and offers him something. You have to see what he offers him.The movie is a little more at depth and the characters aren't like two- dimensional in the 70s. The actors and actresses who give the voices of the characters like Zac Efron, Taylor Swift, Betty White, etc. Are very charming and really likable.But still the 1970's will be the best. Despite adding no resolution because you were left to guess what would happen to Ted in the end. On your own.But the movie solves it in the end. Go see the 1970's original to get the point where capital greed is sad and greedy indeed first. Then go and see the movie.",The Lorax
37,SnakesOnAnAfricanPlain,The Lorax (2012),1,4 August 2012,"Dear God this was yet another appalling kids film that talks down to ""our future"". This is such a huge pile of disgusting drivel I don't even know where to begin. The Lorax sees a town that lives in a huge bubble where everything is made of plastic. One boy goes out to find a real tree so he can bang some chick. He comes across The Once-Ler, theman responsible for the lack of trees who proceeds to tell him the tale of where they all went. The animation is colourful but surprisingly dull. All the characters look so tacky and cheap. I couldn't be absorbed at all. The film treats children like idiots, with obnoxious Alvin and the Chipmunk sound-alike fish and entire scenes with no purpose but to make the kids go ""OOOOOH"" at the 3D. This wouldn't be all that bad (well it would), but the film also has a serious message that it wants you to consider. Can you have it both ways? The original TV short and the book are charming which helps with the heavy handed message. The film also makes a huge mistake in introducing a ridiculous comedic antagonist. The film doesn't need one. WE should be the antagonists and forced to face the state of the world. By making some guy control the air itlets us completely off the hook. We also have characters such as the 'cool' granny to just make sure any attempts at comedy die where they stand. The songs are some of the most dreadful, both lyrically and musically that I've ever heard. You wouldn't believe some of the things they try and get away with. Finally, the narrative structure is a mess. Not surprising based on the length of the book. The original story was told to us, by giving this role to an actual character (who is only doing it for a girl) it once again undermines the story, as does the happy ending. I don't have to do anything now as the story was resolved. It's painful to see things like this happen to great stories. Watch a beautiful animation with a message in Wall-E.",The Lorax

39,Kamurai25,A Tree Says No,7,11 July 2020,"Good watch, will probably watch again, and can recommend.Despite the ""Despicable Me"" / ""Minions"" franchise, Illumination seems to do good work, and they really brought the zaney world of Dr. Seuss to life here, regardless of how much sense it may or may not make at the time.It's been a while since I read ""The Lorax"", but I'm pretty sure the motivation to plant a tree wasn't to get a girl. For all I remember the Onceler's story was the original storybook with a couple of catchy musical numbers thrown in.That aside, there is a lot of fun in this movie with a (ultimately) positive message about environmental conservation, thought it's not as strong as it would like to be, but as palatable as necessary. While I won't bored you with the details necessary to convey my view on environmental education, there is an odd bit to the ""conducting business"" scene series where there almost seems to be a subtle message for capitalistic business during the moments we're being told this is bad, or maybe that was the point: there is a struggle and balance necessary. I just thought it was funny. At least the put message out there for us not to underestimate the elderly.The world / character creation is very well done, and I'm humming one of the songs as I write this, but there is one problem I have with the writing: that the Onceler breaks the story up across multiple days. Once he has his audience (oh, play with in a play: a Shakespearean device), and the movie has its audience, just tell your story through. I'm not a fan of break up a story into multiple stories if it's not necessary (if you've ever binged a tv show, you know what I'm talking about). At least he didn't flip it all around and tell it out of order (see ""Pulp Fiction"").While the Lorax itself is an underwhelming, if subtle, character itself, I can imagine most people will enjoy it.",The Lorax
40,eric262003,An Environmental Story The Avoids Being Preachy,8,14 October 2013,"Based on the classic children's story by the legendary author Dr. Seuss, ""The Lorax"" has the feel of a little league science-fiction story custom made for the younger audience. The atmosphere is vibrant in color and the voice over work is absolutely perfect. In fact the voices are so unique you never have to guess who's the performer's behind the voices. The message about the world's ecology is the main focus of the story, but the moral lessons is never rubbed in our faces. Instead it gives us the freedom to imagine what our world would be like if we lived in world without tress and fresh air can only be bought.The humble town of Thneedville is the epicentre of all that is bad, even though the residents continue to live like everything is hunky-dory. The city landscape is made entirely of plastic and the buildings are jovial and brightly subliminal. The story's unfolding commences when a young man named Ted (Zac Efron) is trying to make an impression of a young lady named Audrey (Taylor Swift) who has aspirations to see a real tree. The plot thickens when Ted walks off the town of Thneedville where he meets a Once-ler (Ed Helms) who's the reason for the tree's extinction. Ted's grandmother (the always entertaining Betty White) persuades Ted by recalling memories when trees actually existed in Thneedville. The Once-ler reveals his sentimental anecdote about how he lays the blame on himself for the trees vanishing in Thneedville. The story recall a young man walking through the woods to seek fortune by carrying a bag of marshmallows for the bears to feed on and an axe to cut down the trees. The trees look vibrant with psychedelic colors equipped with round tufts. This action leads to the appearance of the Lorax(Danny DeVito), a diminutive orange creature who resembles a baby walrus with a moustache. The Lorax is the protector of the forest. At first the Lorax and the woodland animals try to stay cohesive with the Once-ler but one his financial success gets the better of him, it comes at the expense of the woodland creatures as they all abandon the premises. This led to the Once-ler reside as hermit with one last tree seed which he gives to Ted so he could win the heart of his girl and to reveal the errors that has manifested his town for all these years.So although the ecological statement is locked in the story it refrains from overly emphasizing it in our face. Rather the warnings of potential deforestation are exhibited with a positive message much to the chagrin of the Once-ler throwing marshmallows to the bears. I felt the only thing out of place is the hard rock song performed by the leading antagonist Mr. O'Hare (Rob Riggle) who's job is to sell air to the Thneeedville civilians. But the spontaneous atmosphere and the buoyant framework makes the moral lessons of this movie less laborious.",The Lorax
41,Matt_Layden,Cute & Colourful - Just For Kids.,6,20 March 2012,"Dr. Seuss' The Lorax tells two stories, the first is about a young lad who wants to impress a girl by finding a tree in a treeless world. They've never seen one before and an evil millionaire who sells ""air"" to people will do anything to stop him, cause trees give people free air. The second story is about the person responsible for the lack of trees and his feud with the little orange guy known as The Lorax.That would be my main problem with the film, the two story lines going at once make it hard to distinguish who the main character is. At first you would think it's Ted, voiced by Zac Efron who is in love with Audrey. He'll do anything to find this tree and the marketing guys thought it would be a good idea to sell the film as some kind of animated adventure flick about this guy looking for that one tree. Yet, this is not the case, half the storyline involves another character, The Once-Ler, voiced by Ed Helms. This storyline is where we are introduced to The Lorax, voiced by the perfect for animation, Danny DeVito. Neither storyline outshines the other and both sort of fall underneath each other as being uneventful and uninteresting. Feeling uninterested in a film where there are two story lines to enjoy, is a bad thing. A lot of films have multiple story lines going on, known as the A, B, and C story lines, but here both are fighting for the A position. If this isn't the case, then why is the film called The Lorax? Why is that character all over the posters and trailers? The Lorax, has nothing to do in the film. He comes down when a tree is cut and he says ""don't do that"". That's it, nothing more. He makes the one character 'feel bad' for breaking a promise, but nothing more. I guess I expected a little more from someone being presented as such an important part of the storyline. The animation is wonderful, which is the perfect medium for a Dr. Seuss story. Live action would fail, and it did. The colour is bright and enticing for kids, it works for the 3D as well because of the dark glasses. Speaking of the 3D, I'm still not a fan, because the ghosting is still very apparent and it didn't immerse me in the story, it was an excuse to let those wacky Dr. Seuss inventions fly at the screen. Along with the colourful environment, the cuteness of the film cannot be denied. Little kids will love the fish, little bears, the one giant bear and of course The Lorax. These creatures are cute, cuddly and will make even the teenage girls let out the ""awwwwws"". These guys are in the Lorax storyline and whenever we are stuck with Ted in the plastic world, it gets a little dull. There is an exciting chase sequence with the main villain and Ted, which brings some excitement into the film.The Lorax has a message and it does tend to beat you over the head with it. I felt that Pixar's Wall-E did the same thing, only better. The Lorax isn't a bad film, it's just not a great one. There's enough to keep the little ones entertained, with 3 musical numbers that bring back the memories of old Disney flicks. I'd like to see DeVito is more animated films, he seemed to be the only one who really brought any life into his character and he seemed to fit the role well. Swift is barely in it and could have been played by anyone. Animated films these days look for big names and not voice talent. Animated films need to focus more on the story and not the voice actors. I think if this film had more meat to the story, I would have enjoyed it more. Unfortunately, it has to settle for being ""just decent"". If parents want to know that kids will enjoy it, they will. It will keep their attention for the running time, isn't that enough?",The Lorax
42,bkrauser-81-311064,The Bore-ax,5,26 June 2016,"The Lorax is basically about a boy who lives in a plastic world who wants to find a tree for his crush. Venturing out of town to find ""The Once-ler,"" the boy is told (through flashback) the story of the Lorax, why all the trees are gone and why trying to become a business owner is inherently evil.The Lorax was a disappointment to say the least. The story was half- baked, the songs were forgettable and the environmental message was so obvious and preachy, I felt the need to go home and turn on all my appliances, then go out to rent an SUV and drive down the nearest street spraying chlorofluorocarbons in the air just to get the sanctimonious taste out of my mouth. And I consider myself an environmentalist! Well, I recycle anyway.That's not to say the movie is terrible, its not.I just don't see anyone liking it a lot.For its story is as plastic as its main character's home,read the book instead, it's an interesting tome.For this dubious adaption has an odious ring,and its basically an excuse to get Taylor Swift to sing.That and an excuse to shoehorn some corporate tie-in from companies eager to re-brand with an environmentally friendly message. Seriously 70 brands including the Mazda CX-5, IHOP, Target, Pottery Barn, Whole Foods, Comcast Xfinity, Seven Generation Diapers, and HP have all participated in tie-ins for this Dr. Seuss adaptation. I'm not saying I'm not in favor of tie-ins, I just find it ironic that a movie that preaches conservation so vehemently is, in equal measure, a boorish corporate shill.",The Lorax
43,moviexclusive,"Bursting with colour and life, this witty, entertaining and unexpectedly thoughtful adaptation of Dr. Seuss' environmental fable is great family entertainment",8,2 March 2012,"If Dr. Seuss were alive, he would have been 108th on March 2nd, and this colourful adaptation of his 1971 illustrated children's book is just the befitting tribute to him. Not only is it joyous hilarity for the whole family, but it preserves the cautionary message at the heart of its source, combining the artistry of modern-day animation with the weird and wonderful elements of what was apparently Dr. Seuss' favourite book for a delightful and unexpectedly thoughtful experience.And that is really no small feat, as fans of the author can attest- Hollywood has had a hit-and-miss record with the Seuss, bungling terribly in recent years with Mike Myers' 'The Cat in the Hat', before redeeming itself with the 2008 animated 'Horton Hears A Who'. It's no coincidence therefore that the writers of 'Horton'- Ken Daurio and Cinco Paul- are once again the creative scripting force behind this adaptation, and once again the duo demonstrate their sharp Seussian sensibilities in what is possibly the author's most controversial work.Indeed, the story of a reclusive hermit known as the Once-Ler (voiced here by Ed Helms) who recounts his encounter with a strange orange creature known as the Lorax that had huge yellow eyebrows and a moustache like Yosemite Sam was also a pro-conservation and anti- consumerist fable that courted its fair share of detractors when it was first published and still does so today. Of course, these are also different times today, when concerns about climate change and the environment have crept into both the social and political sphere.To expand the short story to feature-length, there is now a backstory to the 12-year-old boy who visits the Once-Ler- named Ted (Zac Efron) as a nice nod to the Dr. Seuss (whose real name was Theodor Grissel), this jolly teenager has but one purpose, to get a living tree and win the affection of his sweet high-school age neighbour Audrey (Taylor Swift). Both Ted and Audrey live in the totally artificial town of Thneedville, where everything including the trees is made of plastic and the people are oblivious to the gray desolate wasteland outside of their cocooned city.With some handy advice from a surprisingly sprightly Grammy Norma (voiced by Betty White), Ted sees firsthand the grim polluted world outside of Thneedville on his way to visit the Once-Ler. Once there, the Once-Ler recounts his folly as a young and ambitious entrepreneur who stumbled upon the beautiful Truffula Valley abounding with candy- coloured lollipop-style Truffula trees, Humming-Fish and cub-like Barbaloots. It's as far from the Truffula Ted's seen as can be, and director Chris Renaud pulls out all the stops to make sure that it is a gorgeous eye-popping visual feast.The first tree Ted falls summons the Lorax, a guardian of nature who tells Ted that he speaks for the trees and implores him to spare a thought for the forest creatures whose livelihood depends on them. For a while, Ted appears to pay heed to the Lorax, but when his knitted garment he calls the thneed becomes an unforeseen sensation in town, greed takes over and it isn't long before the entire valley is decimated.It is a cautionary eco-fable all right, and there is a clever metaphor here in how something so sought after like the thneed can be so quickly and easily forgotten. There is also added relevance in what happens after, as another entrepreneurial mind quickly takes over by supplying bottled fresh air to the people of Thneedville and becoming the town's unofficial mayor in the process. Opportunity presents itself in calamity, but how we make use of it is yet something else altogether- that is the lesson Daurio and Paul make as they set up O'Hare (Rob Riggle) and his two bulky bodyguards as the nemeses Ted has to defeat in a thrilling action-packed finish.The additions will no doubt entertain the kids, but older audiences familiar with the books will be glad to know that the Seussian spirit is well and alive in this zany rollicking adventure. Reverential too is the visual cues that the movie takes from Seuss- both in terms of the curvy undulating lines and shapes as well as the bright colours- and like ""Horton"", you'll know when you see it that you're in his world. Deserving of mention as well is the excellent voice cast assembled for the film. Efron conveys youthful naivety as much as Swift, while Helms gives the Once-Ler its necessary idiosyncrasies as well as an unexpected depth lamenting the folly of his past. But the true firecracker here is DeVito, returning after some years of being sidelined in Hollywood to tip-top form as the Lorax. There is verve and edge in every line of DeVito's delivery, crackling and popping as much as the colours do in every frame.There is also plenty for the kids to embrace, especially the minion-like creatures of the forest courtesy most likely of Renaud- we dare you to resist falling in love with the three aptly named Humming-Fish and the Barbaloots. The stereoscopic treatment here is also a treat (and even more so in IMAX), lending the Seussian-scapes a lush vibrant feel and the action sequences an added dimension of excitement. But of course this is nary just harmless diversion for the kids, and the true weight of this animation is its environmental message of conservation told in a simple- but not simplistic- manner to be understood by audiences of all ages. It is an adaptation Dr. Seuss would very likely be proud of if he were still around, in no small measure because it echoes Seuss' essential plea summarised right at the end: ""Unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot, nothing's going to get better. It's not.""www.moviexclusive.com",The Lorax

Why can't animators focus on something else besides all that environmentalism crud?

I stood up in the movie theater and yelled, ""I am, let this movie shrivel up and die!"", then asked for a refund. I immediately got one, and I wasn't the only one who wanted a refund after seeing it.

When a small boy wants to impress the girl of his dreams, a hunt for the last seed begins that some in the city don't like to see.Somehow this lookes a bit too much like a children movie designed from scratch. Most of the characters were a bit pale, the songs were not necessary and the humor was solid but not outstanding. Given that some of the plot decisions seem rather lazy (I've never seen a vilain giving away his evil plan so willingly without any necessity), I wasn't really convinced. Of course the message of the film is a good and important one and some of the figures like the lorax himself definitely have their charme and potential, but I think that some reconsideration and more love for details would have suited the film well.All in all this is an okay movie, that is neither amazing nor catastrophic.

50,phubbs,The Lorax,4,16 August 2016,"Based extremely loosely on the Dr Seuss story of the same name and as usual with Hollywood they have fudged it all up.The story is an environmental one, an eco plot if you will about the effects of cutting down trees. Put simply (just like the original book did) there is a small town which is gloomy and polluted. The reason for this is because all the trees were chopped down to mass market 'thneeds' by the one they call 'Once-ler'. Once-ler tells a young boy the whole story of how he destroyed all the trees to create his thneeds and ignored the advice and warnings of the Lorax, guardian of the trees.Once-ler regrets his actions and gives the young boy a tree seed to plant so that trees may return as well as the Lorax. There is a bit more to it but that is the basic premise.So what does Hollywood do you ask? well do you really need to ask? I'm sure you can all guess but I'll tell you anyway. Hollywood strips the story down and refits it with tripe filler and made up characters to fill out a decent length run time. Throw in some ridiculous vehicle chase sequences, clichéd slapstick and jokes and some hideous musical numbers and there you have it, typical Hollywood trash.Now I will admit the film looks lovely, full of bright bold colours, its cheerful, light-hearted and with some nice CGI animation. BUT the lesson has been diluted and cluttered by fancy ass visuals and 'action' sequences. Yes there is still a nice message within the film, the finale shows what can be done if they jettison the crapola but that's only about a 3 minute sequence out of an entire film!I simply cannot understand why they thought to create new characters! The new character Aloysius O'Hare is REALLY annoying too, he just looks annoying, making him short...yeah that's not funny. I realise they needed to fill the story to reach a reasonable film run time but if that can't be done then don't do it. Maybe try another route, don't just make a whole load of stuff up! Once-ler was suppose to be faceless, a boogieman like equivalent of modern faceless companies/corporations that destroy nature for their gain. You can't uproot that, that's the whole point!The world where this takes place isn't named, plus it isn't some bright, colourful, 'Willy Wonka' type place with fancy technology!! I see what they did with that sure, but why?? stop changing the whole premise!! it all looks like something outta 'Despicable Me'. Of course we don't know how Seuss would take to it but I'm pretty sure the original fable wasn't meant to include futuristic vehicles, buildings, Once-ler playing guitar, airship things and some god awful songs including the now obligatory hip hop pop song for the final credits which happens for almost all kids films now (more manufactured faceless nobodies singing forgettable songs that will fade into obscurity as quickly as they appeared). I like the fact that Hollywood has tried to put across a good message...of sorts. I'm sure they are more concerned about another franchise to milk that will rake in the moolah but the initial positive effort is there. If only this could of been done more down to earth, with a little more sense towards the source material and maybe in a different media (stop motion would have been nice, Selick directing perhaps?). At the end of the day its merely been mutated into another flashy, churned out, in your face CGI flick (in 3D...ugh!). How ironic, a polluted vision of Dr Seuss' simple little tale, such a shame.Ignore this, stick to the original book or 1972 TV special, don't deny your children these.4/10",The Lorax

Our type of trees were of ancient history, the type the grandmother knew. The artificial town was quite interesting. The plastic bushes were great artwork, but of course disappointing from the green ones we know nowadays. To see the bushes inflated was hilarious, but a strong lesson compared to nowadays people trying to spoil the environment and making our planet inhospitable to growing plants.

54,mitsubishizero,Great movie though some of the message is lost in this adaptation.,8,14 May 2018,"Personally, I liked the movie. In fact it may just be one of my new favorite movies. I do however understand why some people are divided on this adaptation. I do agree that some of the message was lost in translation as some themes are lightly touched on or just outright ignored. The original source material had a balance between goofy characters and a visible motive. With this movie though it focuses more on the goofy characters. One thing I did like was how it fleshed out the Once-ler's origin a lot more, the voice acting's great and while O'hare was a good villain, the original book and cartoon adaptation made it clear that anyone who's careless can be destructive with the environment.Here, the blame's placed mostly on O'hare and his greedy tactics of selling air when it's already free. The Once-ler's also infected with greed too however the movie begins to focus less on that and instead focuses more on the drawbacks of consumerism which's also a theme in the book though in this movie it's given too much attention. Another pet peeve was Ted's voice. Zac Efron was great at providing Ted's voice however he makes Ted (who was originally unnamed in the original) sound and look older than depicted in the book. Ted's said to be 12 yet he sounds like a teen or young adult (or at least hit puberty early than expected).

There, a young boy, in love with an older girl and desperate to get her attention, promises to get her a REAL tree. In order to keep his promise, he must venture outside the city, and find a curious character who will tell him the story of their world, with both its origins and threats.It's an animation that's supposed to teach children about watching over nature and what can happen if it's destroyed. Unfortunately, it's not what it wants to be. Its action isn't very complex and its characters aren't as ""lovely"" as they should have been. You don't really care about them or their faith, you just end up wanting to see how it ends (but even the ending doesn't make the movie any favor). On the upside, it has a lot of funny moments which ""wakes you up"" from time to time and almost all scenes are very colored, a real delight for your eyes.Overall, it's really not what I expected it to be but that doesn't make it a bad movie. Watch it if you find a copy but keep your expectations low (not to be disappointed like I was).",The Lorax
56,silvermistvio,An animation film with the greatest and important message. A Must watch.,8,13 May 2019,"I always remember this film as ""The Last Tree"" regardless of its real title. Maybe because it's about the last tree, so, I considered the title as ""The Last Tree"".This film is one of those films which have important message. Tree is one of the most important things to have in this world. Trees make oxygen and prevent the environment from getting hotter. Chopping trees can make you money of course, but at the same time, it makes the environment worse than before. Nowadays, in some countries, the weather is so hot, hotter than past 2 or 3 years. Mostly, it's because there aren't more trees. People are chopping them to sell. Some people make things and sell them like in the film. Some people are just selling the whole thing. Trees becomes less and hence, making the weather hotter and hotter. So, if we want to stop this condition, we have to protect the trees and plant more trees. Otherwise, it will become exactly shown in this animation.Although this film has the greatest and most important message, it also have the biggest flaw. The trees in this film look weird. The trees from the real world are not like them. In the other words, the trees from the animation aren't realistic. It makes the viewers feel strange.Overall is that this film is also a great film. It's one of those films you can't miss. Everyone must watch this one at least one time and learn a lifetime lesson.",The Lorax
57,ersinkdotcom,"The big-screen adaptation of Dr. Seuss's ""The Lorax"" is a charming and entertaining movie with a message",7,14 August 2012,"Dr. Seuss books are something every person in the U.S. grew up with, this writer included. Nightly readings of ""One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish,"" ""Green Eggs and Ham,"" and ""The Cat in the Hat Comes Back"" fill many an individual's childhood memories. It comes as no surprise that if the writer's name is attached to a film, people of all ages will flock to the theaters to see it. Universal is bringing the latest adaptation of one of his books, ""The Lorax,"" home for viewers of all ages to enjoy on Blu-ray and DVD. This charming animated feature tells the story of a little boy named Ted (Zac Efron). He has a childhood crush on older ""girl-next-door"" Audrey (Taylor Swift). Audrey shares her dream of seeing real trees with Ted. All the trees in their world were cut down before they were born. Ted decides he will find a tree to win the girl's affection. His journey leads him to a strange old hermit named the Once-ler (Ed Helms). The Once-ler tells Ted he will help him, but only if he listens to the story of the Lorax (Danny DeVito) - a plump and crabby critter who used to protect the trees. Children and their parents will find a lot to be excited about with ""Dr. Seuss' The Lorax."" It's a fun but cautionary tale. The movie contains all the quirky ingredients you will find in a Dr. Seuss book. It does a great job of delivering a serious message without sacrificing the enjoyment we all find in the rhyming scribe's many works. All the actors deliver the way you would expect a cast of big names to. Zac Efron is perfect as the wide-eyed and curious Ted. Taylor Swift brings Ted's dream girl Audrey to life. Ed Helms is perfect as the crotchety old Once-ler. Danny DeVito completely embraces his role as the Lorax. His gravely and grumpy sounding voice works beautifully here. The eco-friendly message the movie pushes is an important one. A world without trees would be devastating and detrimental to all life on Earth. However, I'd be lying if I didn't mention I rolled my eyes at one point or another as I imagined hippies and politically correct tree-huggers dancing around together celebrating Mother Nature. I just think there are more important issues to deal with and fixate on. We all must do our part, though. The high definition transfer of ""Dr. Seuss' The Lorax"" looks and sounds great. The vibrant colors of the film keep the audience's eyes glued to the screen. The picture is clean and crisp delivering an enjoyable viewing experience. The dialogue, music, and sound effects are all balanced well in spectacular 5.1 surround glory. There are plenty of special features loaded into this release. Three all-new mini-movies are included. They're short but entertaining nonetheless. We also get featurettes like ""The Making of the Mini- Movies"" and ""Seuss to Screen."" A deleted scene, games, and singalongs are present as well. The 2-Disc Blu-ray Combo Pack of ""Dr. Seuss' The Lorax"" will satisfy watchers of all ages. You get a fun feature film paired with a few new mini-movies and other interactive extras which will thrill consumers. It's a worthy addition to any family's movie library.",The Lorax
58,Christian_Dimartino,"Have no fear, everyone, The Lorax is NOT bad. But not great.",6,4 March 2012,"Dr. Seuss movies don't typically do very well. How the Grinch Stole Christmas was a box office smash, but not well received by critics. I really like that movie. A few years later, the unholy mess The Cat in the Hat was released with similar results. Even Horton Hears a Who was mixed.The latest of his works to be adapted is The Lorax, one of his best works which was basically a story about how a money hungry mystery man named The Once-ler destroyed a beautiful place for money. It, I believe, was meant to symbolize how people are destroying the rain forest, and Seuss was trying to get his point across.The Lorax has some good qualities. The animation itself is very bright and colorful, the actors, which include Danny Devito as the title role, Zac Efron as a kid who wants to plant a tree to impress a girl, and Ed Helms as The Once-ler, are all well casted. And it's a good way to spend your afternoon.But, there's the cons. It doesn't really stay true to Seuss himself, missing a lot of Seuss language that was in his books and the other films. It doesn't rhyme. Also, a lot of the book is missing, it felt to me. There's a lot of new material here, some of it good, some, well, sort of dumb.My biggest problem is The Once-ler character. I like how they gave him a back story. But with Ed Helms at The Once-ler's goofy reins, he turns a really adorable character into a bad guy; an aspiring entrepreneur into a money hungry legend. I don't know, but they shouldn't have made him so nice.Overall, The Lorax isn't a bad movie. I prefer The Grinch and Horton Hears a Who, but it works for what it is. I'm not saying you should rush to go see it, but it's a nice escape. Especially when compared to The Cat in the Hat.B-",The Lorax

61,billygoat1071,A Different Purpose,6,21 March 2012,"It's hard for Hollywood to make an adaptation of a book by Dr. Seuss. Especially if it's something like The Lorax. The Lorax is one of Dr. Seuss' darkest tales with a serious sentiment. This film adaptation keeps the story but it focuses too much to its fun characters and gimmickry of the 3D than the environmental message. It leaves the message as the background of the film. As a whole, it's colorful and fun but it feels very different.The film adds a lot of new things to stretch this small story. Like the Once-ler reveals his face and the kid from from the beginning has a different motive why he went to the Once-ler. It's strange and clever. This is from the creators of Despicable Me and the studio's trademark is to add some cute comic relief characters. The Humming Fish, Swomee Swans, and The Barbaloots are cute enough.It's easy to say that Danny DeVito is perfect as the Lorax and Ed Helms is a bit charming as the Once-ler. Everything in this film fun. The songs are pretty good although it's not quite memorable. What disappoints here is the execution of the story. Yes, the message is there but it feels like it's just the background of the film. More goes to the fun. There's nothing wrong with that but it's too light for this dark story.The film has the heart and soul to show Dr. Seuss' illustration but the storytelling feels too different. The message is there but it's not as compelling as the book. It's pretty hard to say it's a bad film because it's entertaining and fun. It's hard to say it's great because it lacks eagerness to the message. It seems like Horton Hears A Who will remain as the best Dr. Seuss adaptation so far.",The Lorax

The first one, which I watched about 3 years ago, Horton hears the who, is still in my top 20 animated movies of all time. I'd already set mediocre expectations for this one with the reviews, ratings and the plot. At the start, we come to know what message we are gonna get at the end. So, it's not pretty suspenseful. Also, it starts slow. It took almost half the movie to let them come to the track and pick up. It's not slow, but boring in the middle although a few laughs from the little ones which doesn't amuse the giant us too much. No doubt, towards the end, laughs get better and more, however, remain average. The last few minutes are fun, rest it's average/below average stuff. The animation is good.",The Lorax
63,Java_Joe,The message was lost.,2,14 August 2019,"The original Lorax was a story put out by Theodor Geisel better known as ""Dr. Seuss"" about the consequences of sacrificing everything for money. It started as a book, became a cartoon and was generally forgotten about until after his death when suddenly movie studios started bidding for his catalog of work.You see he didn't want his works turned into movies but once he was dead, he no longer had a say. First we got Jim Carrey in ""The Grinch"" and while it was well received the cartoon starring Boris Karloff as the Grinch will always be a personal favorite. And since then they've only gotten worse with the terribly awful live action ""Cat in the Hat"" being the last live action one they made. Since then they've focused on making 3D animated fare and along came the Lorax.The general message has been expanded, but not for the best. The basic story is the same although they had to cram in a bunch of musical numbers, a love story and something about corporatism being really bad. That last bit fits with the narrative but then they went and had to ruin it by marketing the hell out of it, by shilling for about 70 different companies including cars. You know, something that pollutes which is against the movie's message? Talk about tone deaf.The movie also makes the egregious mistake of trying to have minion characters. They appeared first in ""Despicable Me"" as comic relief but were so popular that they took over the second movie and even got their own movie. Characters like that were so popular that now every animated movie seems to need to put in those types of characters. Here it's a group of fish that constantly sing and appear in the background and honestly have no real reason to be there other than ""kids like them"". A little bit is good. Too much is bad.The rest of the movie just feels soulless and there for the express purpose of making money. And yes, I realize that that's the only reason that Hollywood makes movies but it's not asking too much to try to make a good movie that will also make money instead of playing it safe and making something bland like this.",The Lorax
64,cultfilmfreaksdotcom,Green is Money,3,4 March 2012,"If you think Hollywood is the greediest moneygrubbing plastic city in the world, think again – and welcome to Thneedville, where every overly promoted, abundantly commercialized item costs bundles and, scariest of all, there are no trees. Enter Ted, a kid smitten with a gorgeous girl Audrey, who has only one wish – painted along the back of her house are tall skinny things resembling straws harboring wispy windblown cotton candy. These are the long forgotten trees, and she wants one, a real one, badly. Through his wise old granny, Ted learns of The Once-ler, a hermit residing on the outskirts of the shallow metropolis: walled in and policed by a wicked, and very short, dictator O'Hare.But Ted gets easily past the border and, using his power scooter, zips into a dark flatland where he finds a faceless hermit in a spooky house. Here he learns the backstory and what the film's all about: Once-ler was once a poor farm boy who discovered a land abundant in nature and cutesy animals. He realizes, to make his dream invention – what he calls the Thneed (think of a Bionic Snuggie) – he has to chop down a tree: which summons our titular hero, The Lorax. This mustached, peanut-shaped, blunt yet lovable orange creature (voiced by Danny DeVito) is an underdog environmentalist that can only point the Once-ler toward wisdom. But becoming a powerful businessman is Once-ler's priority – and his Thneed's a big hit until all the trees are gone.Now we're back with Ted, whose input means very little – especially since the title character (who has surprisingly minimal screen time and plot relevance) is history and the real tale has been told. Nevertheless, Ted's final mission is to plant one last seed. Although the greedy O'Hare – who sells clean air in cans and fake trees for big bucks – wants him stopped.Kids will enjoy the wonderfully vivid animation and the cutesy characters, especially a bear cub and singing fish residing in the tree-laden forest. Here's where the most involving, fast-paced action occurs. And the overly obvious environmental message works in scenes where each tree falls to their death: like best friends dying slowly, and painfully, before your very eyes.But once the movie ends with a corny singalong about letting it grow, you'll realize this ninety-minute tale was really just a message with lots of vibrant color: Other than a greedy entrepreneur cutting down trees to make money and then realizing his mistake, not much really happens.Yet the real moral of this anti-capitalist movie is that it grossed a whopping $70 million this weekend. But since spending, and making, large amounts of money is a bad thing, you can do the producers a favor: instead of paying $14 bucks to watch THE LORAX, go plant a tree!For More Reviews: www.cultfilmfreaks.com",The Lorax

66,nickmesafilms,Dr. Seuss' The Lorax (2012) - I Speak for the Trees!,8,12 August 2012,"Released as the latest Dr. Seuss film adaptation, in full animation, ""The Lorax"" is a bright and self-aware family film that entertains, even at it's more easily noticed flaws. Featuring an all-star voice cast including Zac Efron, Taylor Swift, Ed Helms, Betty White, Rob Riggle, Jenny Slate, and of course, Danny DeVito. The film starts off with a young boy named Ted, voiced by Zac Efron, who lives in the small town of ""Thneed-ville"", a town that's entirely fake, and entirely plastic, with no nature, no water, and of course, no trees! He has a crush on a high-school girl named Audrey, voiced by Taylor Swift, who dreams of seeing a real life tree in front of her eyes. Ted then sets off to find a tree himself, so he can impress the girl he likes, and then meets the Once-ler, voiced by Ed Helms, who tells the story of what happened to the trees, mainly because that was all his fault. As a young man, as he tries to chop down the trees of the enchanted woods, now comes the Lorax, who speaks for the trees, voiced by Danny DeVito, who tries to point out to not chop down the trees. So, ""The Lorax"" is a family-friendly Seuss movie with an environmental message. Brace yourselves, incoming review! Starting off with the voice talents, besides Zac Efron, Betty White, and Jenny Slate, whom all do pretty nice here, the mainly impressive voice talents were Danny DeVito as the Lorax; a character that appropriately fits the actor's personality, even if it gives him small screen time; and Ed Helms as the Once-ler; bringing comic relief in the hardest way possible, through animation. But as for the least interesting voice talents, Taylor Swift and Rob Riggle deliver plenty of unnecessary performances; Riggle, especially, for playing such an awful, obnoxious, and quite annoying villain; and Swift for being casted in a role that was really unnecessary to the plot. Although these characters mean well, and are easy to cheer on for, mostly all the characters have little character development, trying to show if we really care about the people on screen or not. But as for the positive advantages, the animation is really nice and colorful, the comedy is family-friendly, and there's a heartwarming environmental message about not to ruin and pollute nature, and if you really care about something big, nothing will be fixed right away. It's a movie that will definitely have families leave with giant smiles on their faces. But, ""The Lorax"" does suffer from a few minor flaws; the plot-holes are crazy, the character development is unnoticeable, and most of the musical numbers, although catchy and has a few great tunes, are unnecessary in some places in the plot. Finally, without spoiling anything, all the resolutions are solved way too quickly, the plot is tangled up with three story lines going all over the place, and the story is a little too predictable and cliché. But overall, ""The Lorax"" is a fun, entertaining, and family-friendly ride, that will easily leave kids with a big smile on their face. ""The Lorax"", in my review, ""wondorously entertaining, but nothing remarkable"".",The Lorax
67,Chris_Pandolfi,Environmentalism According to Seuss,8,3 March 2012,"Thirty years before Al Gore was demonized for telling the truth about global warming, Dr. Seuss was chastised for promoting environmentalism in his book ""The Lorax."" Even before its publication in 1970, global deforestation was a major problem, and it continues to this day, especially in tropical regions. I will not provide the statistics here; there's more than enough quality information on the net for you to research. I will say that deforestation is widely agreed amongst the world's best environmental experts to be a major contributing factor in the extinction of species, the displacement of populations, soil erosion, and changes to climactic conditions. Amazing, how perfectly one of Seuss' rhyming passages sums up the solution: ""Unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot, nothing is going to get better. It's not.""This message is not lost in ""Dr. Seuss' The Lorax,"" a 3D computer animated adaptation of the book. Some have already pigeonholed the film as liberal indoctrination, which I think is sad and woefully ignorant. The environment is an issue that is neither liberal nor conservative. It affects each and every one of us. Countless studies have proved this to be true. This movie does not promote a political position; it merely comments on what I believe to be well documented scientific facts. If you take the environment and science out of the equation altogether, it will still deliver a positive life message, one that I think people of all persuasions can agree on: Actions have consequences. Therefore, be sure to think things through and know exactly what you're doing before moving forward.If I've failed to convince you of its thematic merits, there are a host of other reasons to see this movie. It is, for one thing, a visually spectacular work of animation. The colors are vivid and bold. The rendered characters and environments are remarkably faithful to Seuss' distinctly quirky visual style. The look of the film is so good that it's second only to the previous Seuss adaptation, the wonderful ""Horton Hears a Who!"" It's often times quite funny, and as is the case with most family friendly animated films, most of the best gags are reserved for the side characters. In this case, we have legions of teddy bears and land-dwelling goldfish, three of which harmonize in the same helium-voiced fashion of Alvin and the Chipmunks. Both species, we soon learn, are quite fond of marshmallows.To my great surprise, it's also the best 3D film I've seen since ""Hugo."" The projection was bright and clear, and more importantly, there was a noticeable sense of depth perception. In other words, I actually felt immersed in the world. Perhaps it's true that animation is the ideal medium for 3D. The only real disappointments are the songs by John Powell and Cinco Paul; they may be appropriate for the material, and they do have moments of catchiness, but don't expect to be humming any of the tunes as you leave the theater. Such a shame so few composer/lyricist teams have been able to match the Disney song bank, specifically the selections composed by Alan Menken. If you're not humming ""Be Our Guest"" when ""Beauty and the Beast"" is over, you may want to check your pulse.The main setting of ""The Lorax"" is Thneed-Ville, a walled-off city where everything, including the foliage, is artificial. Even air has to be bottled and sold. The whole city is under the control of an air tycoon named O'Hare (voiced by Rob Riggle), who may be small in stature but is enormous in his greed. We meet a boy named Ted (voiced by Zac Efron), who's smitten by a pretty young woman named Audrey (voiced by Taylor Swift). Her dream is to someday see a real live tree. Ted, determined to impress Audrey, goes on a quest to find one. According to his feisty grandmother (voiced by Betty White), the only one who knows about living trees is the Once-Ler, who lives beyond the walls of the city.And so Ted discreetly breaches the city limits, narrowly avoiding O'Hare's ever-present surveillance system. After a brief scooter ride through a smoggy, desolate wasteland of tree stumps, Ted locates the ramshackle home of the Once-Ler (voiced by Ed Helms), who lives in solitude and never shows his face. He tells Ted the story of when he was a young, idealistic inventor, of how the surrounding land used to be a lush forest of Seussian trees, and of how his lust for power and wealth led to the forest's destruction. He also tells him of the Lorax (voiced by Danny DeVito), a small, grumpy orange creature that guarded the forest. It seems not all hope is lost; the Once-Ler bestows a single tree seedling, the last of its kind, to Ted with the hope that he will take it back to Thneed-Ville and plant it.O'Hare does not take kindly to this, for he knows that the free production of fresh air would ruin him. This inevitably leads to a chase sequence through the streets of Thneed-Ville, but because the animation and 3D were in such perfect harmony, I found that I didn't much care about overused story conventions. Ted will not only have to be quicker than O'Hare but smarter as well, for the people are not yet aware of his controlling ways. Can Ted save the day? You will, of course, know the answer by the end of the movie, although I don't think the action is as important as the subtext. That will definitely prevent certain people from responding to ""Dr. Seuss' The Lorax,"" a fact I find troubling. Why is it some of us are unwilling to see reason in matters that are so clearly defined?-- Chris Pandolfi (www.atatheaternearyou.net)",The Lorax

69,Stompgal_87,A colourful adaptation of the Dr Seuss story,8,26 September 2013,"After having watched other film adaptations of Dr Seuss' stories such as 'The Grinch (2000),' 'Horton Hears a Who' (2008) and 'The Cat in the Hat (2003),' this one appealed to me so I eventually added it to my LoveFilm rental list. I received it this week, watched it today and while it is on par with 'The Grinch,' it is better than 'The Cat in the Hat (which was pretty mediocre but still had vibrant set designs throughout and a few funny moments) but not quite as enjoyable as 'Horton Hears a Who.'Like most Dr Seuss film adaptations, this one has brightly coloured backgrounds and characters that are accurately designed to replicate those in Dr Seuss' book illustrations, although a few characters seemed rather derivative. Ted looked almost like Zac Efron who did a solid job with giving him a typical teenage boy voice, the singing goldfish reminded me of the Fish in 'The Cat in the Hat' while the Once-ler looked like the Grinch when I first saw him looking through the wood planks boarding up his window. There are some positive points regarding these characters such as Ted being a realistic representation of a teenage boy by having a crush on Audrey and being easily embarrassed by his mother's dancing to 'The Hustle' while the singing from the goldfish is comical and reminiscent of the singing slugs in 'Flushed Away.' Some of the strong points of this film are the humour and the music. The slow-motion marshmallow-throwing scene was a hoot as was the scene where the animals pushed the Once-ler down the river whilst he was still lying on his bed. I also liked the O'Hare bottled air commercial that is a satire of those alcoholic drink commercials where the announcer says, ""Please drink responsibly"" and the possible reference of The Simpsons episode 'The Telltale Head' where Ted's grandmother decapitates the statue of O'Hare. The music is whimsical and powerful while the opening song 'Thneadville' is incredibly catchy as well as 'You Need a Thnead,' 'How Bad Can I Be?' and 'Let It Grow.' The weakest points are the Lorax not getting as much screen time as I expected, Ted's mother and grandmother having similar hairstyles and the confusion as to whether there are one or two villains (Once-ler and O'Hare). Not only did Zac Efron voice Ted very well but Taylor Swift was outstanding as Audrey and Danny DeVito added a hint of gruffness to the Lorax. I also liked the fact that the film carries a valuable environmental message in a similar manner to the likes of 'Happy Feet' and 'FernGully' as well as the rhyming narrative at the beginning.Overall this is an enchanting adaptation of a Dr Seuss story with plenty of colourful scenes, a subtle sense of humour and captivating music. 8/10.",The Lorax
70,dpolwatte,The Lorax (2012),6,9 December 2018,"Colorful but shallow ""The Lorax"" is a Dr. Seuss Story that should have been executed perfectly but unfortunately looses it's track.But the songs of the movie is great have to give that.Overall - 3/5",The Lorax
71,FairlyAnonymous,"I prefer pretentiousness in smaller doses, sadly not as good as expecting",6,3 December 2012,"The problem with trying to convert a book by Dr. Seuss is that... well... the books are picture books and they are incredibly short. The Lorax was already very simple and the main purpose of the story was to get the point across that destroying habitat can be wrong and that even the smallest of things can make big changes in the world. The book ended without the audience knowing whether the plants would be saved or not. However the movie adds a significant amount to the original plot. The movie tries but it turns into a more generic animated film and doesn't really stand out as anything special.The biggest issue with the movie is that is has a hard time being exciting. The movie is... actually quite boring. There isn't much too it and the action (when it happens) is rather dull and not very original. This mainly occurs with the main side-story which is actually the main story... in short the tacked on story line is boring and unimaginative. The main fun and interest of the movie is from the original plot revolving around a man named Once-ler who wants to become famous by starting a clothing industry which requires to cut down trees that look like giant cotton balls. While the Once-ler story was better than the tacked on plot it wasn't much better. The Once-ler was very likable and I loved his lanky proportions.But the movie also suffers pacing issues. A lot of the plot moves through... songs and very unnecessary songs too... songs just appear whenever they feel like. This makes the plot very jumpy and kind of takes away some of the elements that made the book so good. The Once-ler was supposed to progressively become more and more selfish and his change slowly throughout the book was important. However the movie rushes his character change into one song. This is only mildly effective and only minutes after his huge character change does he finally realize his fault. This makes any character development gained through the song appear meaningless. It would've been better if it were more progressive.I will admit that there is some good voice acting from Taylor Swift, Ed, and Danny. Zac Efron did okay but have the voice of an adult for a little kid seemed odd. Another issue with the plot is that they tried to fit a villain into the plot for no reason other than conflict. The villain actually destroys the original meaning of the book. The original purpose of the book was to say that anyone can cause great destruction and that even when we believe we are innocent we can deceive ourselves. However the villain basically says that only big corporations are evil. This changes the shift from a personal level to a ""let's blame big corporations about the environment"" For me there were only a couple of enjoyable parts throughout the movie and they all revolved around the conversations between the Lorax and Once-ler. I loved the last few moments of the movie with Once-ler while the whole ending does change the ending to the book but I think it was for the better (not saying that is was a better ending, but it was better than what I thought the initial ending was).On a lighter note, the animation is great. The animation is very respectful to the Doctor Seuss universe and I can tell that there are some very talented animators that worked on this movie.

73,f-88612,"""YOU GREEDY DIRTBAG!""",5,7 May 2021,"Just like the book was, particularly the musical numbers. In fact, many actually consider it to be even worse because it neglects the subtlety and Strawman Has a Point moments from the original book and special. By painting a clear right and wrong picture, they overlook the more realistic negative impacts that well-meaning-but-ignorant people can have on the environment. Its more ""lighthearted"" moments which are subjected to overly cheerful song and dance numbers are this, most likely in the very beginning and very end. Its bright, colorful visuals don't help either. And completely caramelized when little 3-year old Marie suddenly started singing. There was originally a different song that served as Once-ler's villain song instead of How Bad Can I Be. It wouldn't have been out of place in a rock opera, and was a fair amount darker and less goofy than the final product, showing that greed and pride were the reasons Once-ler went as far as he did. This is generally agreed to be the reason that ""Biggering"" never got animated in the movie, likely because they thought that it would be too dark for the audience and cause the movie to sell less. A song criticizing humans for being greedy b---s was removed by a few greedy b---s... ironic. In the film, the main villain is charging people for clean air mainly because of their overly polluted air and smog, In recent years, an ""oxygen bar"" in Delhi gives Indians a gulp of fresh air, and even later than that, China began selling bottled air as well. Low air quality has given a business opportunity to entrepreneurs offering pollution-free oxygen at a price. Zac Efron's role as Ted, as he is an adult man voicing a teenaged boy. Taylor Swift's role also sometimes gets this, but to a lesser degree. Despite Ted and Audrey being voiced by Zac Efron and Taylor Swift respectively, their characters never sing a note. O'Hare is an unnecessary addition and a one-dimensional villian who only exists to make the Onceler look better, which defeats the whole message of the original book. The Once-Ler's family actually made far more interesting villains than O'Hare being naturally un-supportive, greedy, and manipulative. Wouldn't it have been better for more of the conflict to show them how destroying nature is a bad thing and along the way, maybe reconcile with his family? Tying in with the above, some people feel it would have made much more sense if the Once-ler's family were the rulers of Thneedville rather than O'Hare, which would tie the Once-ler's backstory more tightly to the main plot and make Ted's ultimate victory that much more meaningful. Audrey could've been a more engaging protagonist than Ted, considering how she actually cares about the trees, unlike Ted, who only cares about getting into Audrey's pants. Not to mention that the movie doesn't explain how she got to know about trees in the first place.",The Lorax
74,lotekguy-1,highly entertaining for all ages,7,2 March 2012,"The demented alien pod person who took over Lou Dobbs' body has railed against this charming animated feature, based on a beloved children's' book. He claims it's part of an Obama/Occupy conspiracy to brainwash kids with pro-environment/anti-business messages. Dr. Seuss wrote the story in 1971, when President Obama was 10; and, given how long it takes to draw and voice such productions, most, if not all the work was done long before the Occupy Movement began.The premise is a dystopic reality beneath the idyllic surface of a town that's 100% artificial, after all the trees were chopped up to make a certain product. Greed and short-sighted thinking led to lurking disaster. But what's new, or even controversial, about that? For decades, the entire lumber industry has understood the need for planned re-foresting to assure the future availability of raw materials, and its own survival. As to the politicizing polemics, Wall-E presented an even gloomier future with otiose blobs of humanity floating in space above the garbage-strewn Earth they had to abandon. That came out before the 2008 elections. I don't recall the original Mr. Dobbs, or the pod overlord who apparently evicted him from his own flesh, blaming that one on President Bush.More importantly (and rationally), the film offers fun for all ages with delightful visuals, a perky pace, a few first-rate musical numbers and several well-crafted characters. Danny DeVito, Zac Efron and the blissfully ubiquitous Betty White head the voice cast. The 3-D option is a fine enhancement, making a number of scenes more exciting than 2-D. And, if every ticket purchased pains those pod people trying to pass for humans, eventually driving them back to their home planet, consider that a bonus.",The Lorax
75,BabelAlexandria,"Seussian Allegory of Industrialization, But What Does the Lorax Represent?",6,12 April 2021,"I'm not a huge fan of Dr. Seuss, and neither are my kids. This story is one of the better ones, given its clear message of stopping environmental degradation, especially for profit, whether by cynical capitalists or optimistic young inventors. Even if it takes place in a fantasy world, rather than a realistic depiction of nature, the message is just as obvious for young viewers, I believe, and more likely to make an impression on them. But I wondered about the choice of the Lorax as the tree's first appointed advocate, the ultimate motivator of conservation: he's not only non-human, but also magical. So what exactly is the Lorax ""in real life""? Does the world even have one?We watched the 3D version, which definitely added to the experience.",The Lorax
76,CMTiago,Great animation work and wonderful message,8,11 June 2014,"With colorful sets and lively characters, The Lorax is sure to please both children and adults alike. Adapted from the beloved book ""Lorax, by Dr. Seuss, the movie delivers a funny and important experience that while it may provoke discussion, in nonetheless vital for the survival of the planet. The story revolves around a young boy named Ted who is looking to impress Audrey, the girl of his dreams. After hearing that she would like to see a real live tree, he will search for answers as to why there are no more trees and why Mr. O'Hare, the town billionaire, sells fresh air for a living. His grandma indicates him to the Once-Ler, a reclusive man with a dark past. As this mysterious figure tells the story, Ted will learn of what happened and fight for everything he loves. The story is quite interesting and much has been said of its agenda. Of course I agree with its message which I think is more reachable for the adults than kids. At the end of the day The Lorax is a wonderful animation with plenty of laughs for the young ones and an essential story for adults.

77,dhaufrect-1,"A Winner Cartoon is ""Lorax""",9,14 September 2013,"A real winner of a cartoon is ""Lorax"". It is the story of a young boy who seeks the recognition by a young girl with whom he is infatuated. It is directed by Chris Renaud and Kyle Balda (co-director). The writers are Dr. Seuss (based on the book by) Cinco Paul (screenplay). The young man is required to listen to a story by the Lorax in order to discover the reason for the loss of the trees in their fair city. Danny DeVito is the voice of the charming Lorax, an impish figure who seems to know all. Ed Helms is the Onceler voice and does a fine job in the voice over. Zac Efron is Ted. Taylor Swift plays the voice of Audrey. And Betty White does a masterful job as the voice of Grammy Norma in her own inimitable way. Mr. O'Hare's voice is done by Rob Riggle and he does an admirable job. The colors are vibrant. The music is delightful and the environmental story is touching. I can highly recommend this cartoon for young and old alike.",The Lorax
78,Simon_Says_Movies,Pleasant But Disjointed,7,5 March 2012,"Forgoing the urge to write this entire review in Dr. Seuss-esque rhyming prose (you can thank me later), I will simply say that at heart, The Lorax is true to the spirit of the children's book by which this adaptation is inspired. However, one doesn't have to carry a doctorate in anatomy to know that the heart only makes up a small portion of the body, and while important to keep things flowing, a brain is required to make it all work. It is in that more cerebral realm where The Lorax could use an education.The Lorax is by far my personal favorite of the Dr. Seuss canon, which comprises 46 wonderfully creative books (and over a dozen more crafted under other pen names) from 1937 all the way up to 1990. What makes The Lorax stand out among so many masterful works is its still poignant environmental message, the fact that it boasts a more structured narrative than his goofier books and simply exhibits some of the best examples of his trademark rhyming. Its relevant themes and more traditional storytelling configuration made it one of the most ripe for adaptation.At its core, The Lorax is (as I mentioned) a faithful adaptation, and while the source material is strong, there is simply just not that much to be faithful to. At only 45 pages, adapting this book is akin to stretching out a Saturday Night Live skit or basing a film on a board game or toy – ample padding must be provided. This comes in the way of a romance between two young residents of the fantastical Thneedville, Ted (voiced by Zac Efron) and Audrey (Taylor Swift), the inclusion of some original songs and perfunctory ""action scenes."" The majority of The Lorax comes in flashback as Ted ventures to visit The Once-ler (Ed Helms) and find the truth behind the now-extinct Truffula trees to impress his young lady love. It is the quantity of musical numbers, such as ""How Bad Can I Be?"", that I was not expecting. Although chipper, they add nothing but running time – just like the extra dimension which only serves to desaturate the vibrant animation. This is the third product from upstart production company Illumination Entertainment after Despicable Me and Hop, and only its second in 3D. I can't speak to the quality of the gimmick in the former as I was able to catch a screening in regular format, but the studio is clearly doing nothing revolutionary after what I've seen from The Lorax.Onto The Lorax himself (itself?) as voiced by Danny DeVito. The character scores the most laughs and DeVito does solid work, easily making us forget (despite their similar stature) that it is a recognizable celebrity behind the orange. My personal peeve is his natural voice, which is not anything close to how I would picture the creature talking. Words leant by someone less gruff and ornery-sounding (closer to a Hugh Laurie or George Clooney or hell I'm sure Hank Azaria could pull off something great) would have been a more preferred contributor, but to each his own.With the exception of Helms, all of the casting choices are odd. You have a past-his-prime actor (sorry Danny) in the lead and two 20- something pop icons added to the mix. One could guess their singing abilities had something to do with the choice, but neither lends his or her pipes to any of the songs. The questionable casting of Efron and Swift with aside, they do give solid performances and certainly don't call attention to their starpower. I find them much more distracting in live-action fare (Swift especially) than I did in The Lorax.Hoping for so much with this version of The Lorax, I can't help but be disappointed, if not generally pleased by the disposable entertainment on display, however disjointed. Most of all, I'm hugely thankful it was not an utter blunder, but thinking down the road, it makes me wonder. If a darker, more mature treatment of this Seussian fable could come into the mix, one that would stand the test of time, like How the Grinch Stole Christmas from '66. One thing I can say (whether or not such will ever be planned) we can be thankful we don't have another debacle like The Cat in the Hat on our hands.Sorry, I couldn't resist.",The Lorax
79,Reckno64,Guilty Pleasure,7,30 November 2019,"Well it certainly isn't a GREAT film, or even a good one. But.....I just can't hate it. I was 14 when this came out, and I dare say I was satisfied with it upon seeing it. I had read the Lorax book when I was a kid and it left me feeling very sad. One of the first times a book I read had a downer ending, but that was the point. The message of the book is at its strongest when left with the word ""unless"". This movie decides to take it a step further and end on a happy note with our main hero taking action into his own hands and planting the very last tree.This totally contradicts the point of the original book and explains the disappointment people had in this film. On the other hand, I really liked this ending. It provided the closure I so badly desired as a kid, and the ending in this movie left me very happy, to the point where I nearly cried.Other good things about this movie are that it's colorful, the settings are creative and nice to look at, the songs are catchy, and the voice acting is pretty good. I didn't mind the pointless villain ""O'Hare"" too much either as he was kinda funny and enjoyable to watch.This movie is objectively mediocre (many would agree its outright ""bad"") but I really liked it, memes aside. It's probably my most guilty pleasure among animated movies, and one of my favorite movies from Illumination! Give me more like this Illumination, rather than pointless Minions cash grabs and boring movies like Secret Life of Pets. The Grinch last year was a slight step up, but it felt WAY too safe for me. So safe and saccharine that it was far less memorable than The Lorax. Don't be afraid to take risks, it might pay off once in awhile! It certainly did for me at least in ""The Lorax"". :)",The Lorax

He could have planted the seed where the dead trees are.Why is there one and only one seed left? How come the towns people don't know trees can produce oxygen? The lorax (tree protector) didn't do much. In fact, the story would be more or less the same without this character.I fast forwarded through most of the singing and dancing routines.I hope they didn't pay a lot of money for the celebrity voice overs.

81,Vincent_B,Completely Ruins the Moral,2,24 October 2012,"Yeah I watched the 25 minute cartoon and read the book. The ending was Dr. Seuss telling us, if you don't take care of the planet, the planet will end up taking you out. Here this movie makes everything OK at the end with a musical dance number. This sends a completely different message to the kids. Hey kids don't worry about it, we can all fix it with song and dance! I can just imagine someone will do this to his ""The Butter Battle Book"" next. Character's personalities were changed, The Once-ler was just a misunderstood man instead of someone who came in to destroy nature for his own greed. The young boy in the story was not there for himself but to impress a girl. They cloned granny from ""Hoodwinked"" and pasted her in complete with XXX skillz. Then they topped it all off with a small villain. Ted's mom calls him a babyman. I am over 6 foot but my mom is short, are we to assume short people are evil? Is this the new moral?Many of the scenes was just time filler to the point they had no bearing on the story. Bed in the river, song and dance numbers, playing games with the family, and breakfast. This movie is just as bad as ""The Cat in the Hat"" remake. I am happy to say, I am not the one who rented either one these movies.Sorry, but I get real tired of people making stuff without merit.

This is disappointing compared to the book and 1972 cartoon version.

83,Treyroo,Another in a short list of quality films based on a Dr. Seuss book,7,24 November 2012,"After numerous attempts at live-action films, have animators finally found their groove when depicting a tale by the late, legendary Dr. Seuss? Or are the majority of professional reviewers correct in their belief that the subject matter is not expansive enough for a full-length feature?Ted (voiced by Zac Efron) is a twelve year-old boy in the perfectly plastic metropolis of Thneedville. Everything in Thneedville is artificial and air itself is only available to those who pay for it. Ted (Efron), more than anything, wants to impress Audrey. Audrey (voiced by Taylor Swift) wants to see a real tree, but all the ones in Thneedville are electric and powered by batteries. Some even come equipped with a disco function utilizing music and mirrored balls. Ted asks his family where he might find a tree and his grandmother (voiced by Betty White) says that if he wants to know about trees he'll have to venture outside of town and ask the Once-ler. The Once-ler (voiced by Ed Helms) is a hermit who never leaves his house and refuses to even speak to visitors until his very specific, very peculiar demands are met. Once they are, he begins to recount the epic tale of his arrival in the forest and eventual introduction to its protector and advocate The Lorax (voiced by Danny DeVito).In such politically-charged times, there'll no doubt be critics who decry this film as preachy or anti-business. Perhaps if I held beliefs similar to said critics, I might agree. As I don't hold such beliefs, what I saw was highly entertaining and even hilarious. I'm no fan of Zac Efron or Taylor Swift, but they were up to the task and while Danny DeVito might not have been the best choice, in my opinion, he managed. If you have young children, this film is a must-see that you might actually enjoy and if you don't have children, who knows? You might just enjoy it anyway. I did.",The Lorax
84,bdgill12,"Decent Enough for Kids, Not That Great for Adults",6,23 March 2012,"I think it's fair to say that we have yet to see a full length film based upon the work of Dr. Suess that measured up to the value of the written versions. Ron Howard's How the Grinch Stole Christmas came the closest to hitting the mark but I think most Suess fans would agree that they'd just assume watch the old cartoon classic Grinch over the Jim Carrey interpretation. The Lorax falls closely in line with its Suessian brothers, providing a decent piece of family fare that doesn't live up to the charisma of the book.Like many young teenagers, Ted (Zac Efron) has a crush on a slightly older girl, a neighbor named Audrey (Taylor Swift). When Audrey reveals that the one thing she wants the most is to see a real life tree, Ted sets out on a quest to find the Once-ler (Ed Helms), a hermit who has some knowledge of trees. Ted gets more than he bargains for, though, as the Once-ler draws him into the vivid tale of how he met the fabled Lorax (Danny Devito) and ultimately became responsible for the extinction the trees. And when all is said and done, Ted is tasked with reviving the growth of trees in the town of Thneedville. The hatred being spewed by (overly angry) viewers in the direction of The Lorax is more than a little shocking. If you were to browse through the user reviews on IMDb, you'd think you'd stumbled upon a right-wing message board, not a collection of thoughts on a kid's movie. The reason for all the venom is the environmental message at the core of The Lorax which apparently angers, like, a LOT of people. Here's where I stand on the whole thing and then we'll move on to the actual film. I'm far from a classic environmentalist. I enjoy hunting and fishing, support the expansion of oil drilling operations, and think Styrofoam cups are just the best. But is it really all that bad to maybe suggest that we give a passing thought to not chopping down every tree on the planet? I really don't think that's asking too much of anyone. At times the message of The Lorax becomes heavy handed and overwhelms the, ""I'm just here to watch a cartoon"" vibes but personally I didn't find it to be inappropriately preachy. Then again, this was always one of my favorite Suess books and I was fully aware of the deeper message going in.Now that I've set myself up for sniper fire from the people who hate trees (I kid, I kid), let's move on to the non-controversial portions of The Lorax which is a fairly mixed bag. There are moments and scenes within this film that elicited genuine laughter from me but these bright spots are swallowed up by a fairly ho-hum narrative that never aspires to me much more than adequate. The lively, beautifully colored animation is contrasted, and ultimately equaled, by the boringness of the main characters and the uninspired script. The musical numbers come about far too infrequently, leaving me to wonder why they had any musical scenes in the first place. In addition, while the cast is strong, only DeVito shines consistently, though Helms does a quality job when he is actually called upon to do something. It's not that there's necessarily anything wrong with the path taken by The Lorax but I would have liked to see it turn a corner in the early going and strive for excellence rather than settle for alright-ness. All of this makes The Lorax just another in a long string of Suess adaptations that fail to live up to the source material. It is cute and not entirely worthless but it lacks the charm that it needs to truly excel. If nothing else, a larger portion of Suessian verse within the dialogue would have made it more memorable and reduced the blandness. As is, The Lorax is an acceptable children's movie that shouldn't be too difficult for most non-tree hating adults to sit through.Please see my reviews at thesoapboxoffice.blogspot.com",The Lorax
85,Animated_Antic,A misguided and often clumsy Dr. Seuss movie.,5,4 September 2018,"There's something about Dr. Seuss books that seem to work well with television than they do on the big screen. With the exception of ""Horton Hears A Who!"" from 2008, the Dr. Seuss movies don't really work. ""The Lorax"" is sadly another one that also doesn't work. Despite boasting the same writers as Horton and having a mostly pretty good cast, the film falls into the trap of a book adaptation that was given the Hollywoodized treatment. Basically, it's where it has to become appealing for mainstream audiences adding cool new hip things at the time that'll become quickly dated in a few years. In short, this film really falls apart.In the artificial town of Thneedville, a boy named Ted (Zach Efron) has a crush on a high school girl named Audrey (Taylor Swift). Wanting to win her heart, he soon discovers that she really wants to see a real life tree and not a synthetic one that's all over town. He soon discovers that in order to get a tree, he must leave town in search for a mysterious hermit known as the Once-ler (Ed Helms). After arriving, he soon is told the tale of how the younger Once-ler proceeded to make an invention called a thneed resulting in the chopping of a Trufulla tree and the appearance of the Lorax (Danny DeVito), a creature who speaks for the trees. Meanwhile in the present though, the greedy mayor of Thneedville, Aloysius O'Hare (Rob Riggle) sees Ted leaving town constantly to hear the tales of the Once-ler and panics knowing that it could damage his reputation of selling bottles of fresh air to people. What happens next? Well, I guess you might as well know if you know the original tale and can tell by this new story added in.There are two plots that occur in the story of ""The Lorax"". One involving Ted trying to get a tree for Audrey much to the chagrin of O'Hare and the other focusing on the Once-ler's mishaps involving his dreaded invention and how he didn't listen to the Lorax. It's pretty clear to which plot is more interesting, but both of them have problems. The newer plot isn't very interesting as it's so predictable and bland that it just begs the question of why it needs to exist. The plot involving the Once-ler and Lorax is a lot more fun, but it's often dated and too rushed at times because it takes a step backwards to the Thneedvile plot line. It's strange as the film had the same writers of ""Horton Hears A Who!"", but it somehow didn't recapture the same magic and that could be because Blue Sky honestly knew how to pull of the more zany world of Seuss than Illumination. The animation is a big plus for the movie though. It captures the work of Seuss to a tee and has bright, beautiful colors that make the world eye popping. I also do like the character designs as well, with the exception of the Once-ler. The reason why is because in the original book as well as Friz Freleng's original TV special, they kept the character hidden with the exception of his arms which proves that the Once-ler could be anyone. By showing him, it ruins the magic. Also, I imagined him more as an odd creature rather than a human, but that could be just a nitpick. The characters are mostly misses. Ted and Audrey are bland and forgettable, the Once-ler is pretty dated and annoying at times and O'Hare is just a cliche villain that does have any appealing qualities to him. Even his design looks similar to Edna Mode from ""The Incredibles"". The Lorax and Ted's Granny on the other hand, are pretty fun. That could be because of their actors. I mean, you can't go wrong with Danny DeVito and Betty White. Another thing I have to talk about, and this is the biggest problem of the movie, are the songs. Yikes, were they bad. I think John Powell is a great composer and has given us some fantastic scores with the music in the film being pretty good, but his songs in this film are terrible. I feel they were thrown in last minute due to pressure from the studio and it clearly shows. One lyric in a song (and it's not an ad lib or anything) was ""La la la la la la la la la la li"". Yeah, that's pretty lazy storytelling.So, is ""The Lorax"" a movie I'd recommend? Not really. Despite it's great animation, it's pretty clumsy as it's story is clunky and uninteresting at times, the characters are mostly misses and the songs are really bad. It's not a movie I'd watch again. If you want a better Dr. Seuss movie, I'd just watch ""Horton Hears A Who!"" or even just stick with the original television specials from Chuck Jones and Friz Freleng. They're much better than this.",The Lorax

I suppose they wanted to make the characters and the whole film look humorous but well, I can't buy that. There are also many things that doesn't make sense; I know this is intended for children but it could been so much better. This film is colorful, visually pleasing but it really seems to me that this film is mostly about the furry trees and there is nothing more to it. In brief, this film is a huge disappointment when compared to the other films from its own studio such as the Despicable Me where there are so many elements in it. It really could have been so much better.So, it is sad to say that I do not recommend this film, pretty sure there are plenty of films more amusing, more interesting, more meaningful and more heartwarming to watch than this.

Well, with the release of ""Dr. Seuss' The Lorax,"" it looks like things may be turning around...or so we hope! ""The Lorax"" is definitely the best animated feature to be released since the inexplicably under-rated ""Megamind."" First and foremost, there is the story. The film could have come across as an insanely cheesy and ridiculous plight for the environment directed at children in a forgettable manner but rather, Cinco Paul and Ken Daurio's script manages to enrapture the incredibly important message of our need to change our ways and save the earth in a way that is absolutely delightful, clear and entertaining without being preachy. And when the answer to the world's deterioration gets sung by a chorus, I could not stop myself from getting choked up topped with a phenomenal final pop song by Ester Dean entitled ""Let it Grow (Celebrate the World)."" Then there is the animation itself. Clearly it was done digitally, but the presentation has nuances and a warmness of old-school hand-drawn animation, and I am not sure why. But the entire visual of the film was warm.

Or I should say, entertainment plays a distant second to politics. Of course, it's a very well made movie; with great animation and acting, but it's all in service to a highly dubious message. To be brief, the film makes it clear that earning money is bad bad bad bad bad. In fact, one wonders why they didn't give the tickets out for free, if profit is so evil. In the film, a young entrepreneur has an idea for a product that people would want to buy, so he sets off from very humble beginnings to bring his idea to life, and becomes fantastically successful. But to make his product, he needs to cut down trees, and eventually all the trees are gone and he's ruined. Over the course of the film we're treated to several musical numbers to drive home the point that money is bad, shopping is bad, and businesses are bad.Great message for kids right there; don't bother going into business because you're just going to ruin the world. Don't follow your dreams if your dreams don't include planting trees. Life is a zero-sum game; either you're an evil, greedy businessman or you 'care' about 'change'. Really pathetic. And not very entertaining.",The Lorax

92,FilmFreak94,"Not the Best Dr. Seuss Adaptation, But It Is An Enjoyable One",7,2 March 2013,"The Lorax was released as a tribute to the legacy of Dr. Seuss on his birthday, March 2nd. With that said you would be forgiven for assuming this film would be something really thoughtful, really moving and really creative. Well... it's really creative.First things first; the story takes place in the city of Thneedville run by a rather short man named O'Hare. O'Hare has made a successful industry by selling air to people because the air outside the city is too polluted. Our hero is a boy named Ted (voiced by Zac Efron) who has a major crush on a girl named Audrey (voiced by Taylor Swift). One day Audrey shares her aspirations that the one thing she wants more than anything is to see a real Truffula Tree which barely anyone remembers grew around the area. Ted gets advice from his Granny Norma (voiced by Betty White) to go see The Once-ler and ask him what happened to the trees. The Once-ler begins his story of how he came to the land to make a revolutionary product called a Thneed which could morph into anything you desired. The only thing is he need the fur of the Truffula Trees in order to make it, which required chopping them down. This awakens the legendary Lorax (voiced by Danny DeVito) who speaks for the trees and warns the Once-ler that chopping down too many trees will lead to unforeseen consequences. Once-ler is reluctant to chop down any more trees but when his overbearing family arrive to help production The Once-ler gives into the pressure and begins chopping down trees until they're all gone. When he has finished his story he gives the very last Truffula seed to Ted and asks him to plant it in the town for all to see. But will greedy executive O'Hara allow this tree to be planted?This movie has a lot of creative and funny talent behind it. However there are a few noticeable holes in the plot. For one thing, if the air outside the town is too polluted for inhabiting, then where does O'Hare get the clean air? Does he filter it? And is Thneedville the only inhabited area on the earth? The Once-ler and his family clearly came from another part of the world so what happened to everyone else? These nitpicks may not upset children or even those viewing it a first time but they are confusing to say the least. However I will say that the parts with The Lorax and The Once-ler are the best parts of the film. Their relationship is fleshed out a little more from The Lorax being a preachy, well Lorax into something of a best friend to The Once-ler who in turn has been changed into a well-meaning inventor who initially promises not to cut down any more trees after the first one. Their relationship makes the scene where the last tree is cut down and The Lorax leaves a little more dramatic which was a good choice on their part.The parts with Ted and his family and Audrey aren't terrible but they're considerably less interesting than the parts with The Lorax and Once- ler. And the villain O'Hare seemed like a real waste. He doesn't want any trees growing because they produce clean air and that will ruin his business. Which honestly makes him out to be nothing more than a Captain Planet villain. This sort of film didn't really need an antagonist in order to get its message across. The film also boasts a few music numbers. And while they're not Oscar worthy by any means they're all incredibly catchy and fit the mood of the story. However there is one that I think is just perfect. Near the middle of the film the scene from the book where The Once-ler begins to recklessly chop down all the trees in order to increase his business is portrayed through the song ""How Bad Can I Be."" This scene is awesome. I mean it; the song is catchy, the visuals are akin to the book, and it sums up the scene in the book amazingly. It's the best scene in the whole movie and is worth waiting the first hour for.So while the movie has problems does that mean it's terrible? No. I actually really enjoyed this film. The all star voice cast was cleverly chosen (even if Taylor Swift and Zac Efron surprisingly didn't take part in the musical numbers) the animation seems like it came right out of the pages of Dr. Seuss, and while the story isn't perfect it at least keeps you invested. This movie is at least worth one chance. Ignoring all the plot holes it's a decent tribute to Dr. Seuss and a decent movie to spend an hour and a half watching.",The Lorax

But it was not just overkill, it completely destroyed the tone and power of the story. This movie has voice talent, I'll give them that, and the visuals are stunning, but the tone and music just were awful choices. And for me, it is NOT the Lorax. It is some bad Hollyweird reimagination. The animated classic is the only way to go, if you want a motion picture, but the best way is to read the book, an amazing classic.

96,Filvies144,"Better than the cat in the hat, but not great",4,4 October 2015,"Now before this film was bad they made 2 awful live-action adaptations, the Grinch, and the Cat in the hat. They were so bad that Dr. Suess's wife did not allow any more of them. Then they made Horton hears a who animated, which was decent. But now lets look at this one.OK, lets start with the plot. The main plot is pretty weak because it's about a boy who lives in a town with no trees but fake designs that people like called thneedvile. He visits the onceler not because he was interested in nature. He gets in trouble by the mayor doing it, but he does it to receive a seed for a truffula tree, for a girl. Yep, that's all. But the good thing is that the plot of the original book with the Lorax and the onceler is pretty good. So the main story is not well written, but the books plot is.The animation is pretty good. The character design has always been a weak point at illumination, but it is decent. The environment is very colorful and looks excellent. So you got to hand it to the animation.The characters I like the most is the onceler . The onceler because he goes through development, and knows that what he did was wrong. Danny DeVito does good as the Lorax, but the Lorax doesn't get enough screen time, but is slightly annoying as the onceler said it best. The other characters are very one dimensional and the mayor would've been a better villain if he had been more sinister.There are 4 surprise musical numbers. All of them are horrendous. With bad lyrics, bad tune, and are very surprising and annoying. They are only a little better than Rebecca Black's Friday, but that's not saying anything at all. These songs are horrid! So the verdict overall is that it's not any better than the just OK Horton hears a who movie. It's just not. The animation is pretty good, but I forgot to tell you that the jokes are pretty bad actually. With only 2 good characters but otherwise a one dimensional cast, a weak main story, and atrocious songs, it is an improvement of the live action films, but it is still just not good.

98,andrewtisler,"A heartwarming adaptation of a beloved Dr. Seuss story, full of fantastic animation, great voice actors, and a surprisingly powerful message about environmental protection",9,26 September 2021,"There have been numerous adaptations of Dr. Seuss properties before, with only three at this point produced as actual movies. When I heard that Illumination Entertainment, the studio behind ""Despicable Me"" and ""The Secret Life of Pets"", was making a film adaptation of ""The Lorax"", I was eager to see what the movie had to offer. Overall, it turned out to be a pleasant experience for me.Ted Wiggins, an idealistic 12-year old boy (voiced by Zac Efron), lives in the town of Thneedville, a plastic city populated by supporters of the greedy O'Hare (voiced by Rob Riggle), the town's mayor and CEO of the O'Hare Air company. Desperate to win the affections of his female friend Audrey (voiced by Taylor Swift), Ted goes beyond his city's borders into a smog-filled territory that was once full of Truffula Trees. There, he learns about the story of the Lorax (voiced by Danny DeVito) from an old man named the Once-e-Ler (voiced by Ed Helms), and how the Once-e-Ler's greed had caused him to deplete the forest of all the Truffula Trees in order to make and sell a ""Thneed"", a pink material object made out of the Truffula tufts, which has multiple uses. The story is fast-paced but full of honest emotion, solid execution, and hilarious humor.Ted's desire to do more for his town and fix the environment that was destroyed by the Once-e-Ler's greedy motivation is very inspiring, and it shows a keen interest in ecology. He is almost like his town's Lorax: speaking for trees, and wanting the environment to be regrown as it once was before. This version of the Once-e-Ler is more sympathetic than previous versions, being depicted as a young man determined to prove his worth to his family that his Thneeds can be successful. He also has a much closer relationship with the Lorax, to the point where, unlike the original version, he regrets his decisions he made when he was younger, and eventually reunites with the Lorax at the end, congratulated for his change of heart and desire to regrow the forest he once chopped down. O'Hare is an example of how Ted would have ended up if he didn't care about the environment, and what the Once-e-Ler once was when he was younger, with the Once-e-Ler's events inadvertently causing O'Hare's. Audrey is Ted's love interest, desperate to see a real tree. Each of these characters brings a different personality to the story, and some actually bring more hope into the film than others.Like with ""Horton Hears a Who!"", ""The Lorax"" has great animation that stays in spirit of the original source material. It really captures the look of the world well.This movie is also a musical, with some of the catchiest songs ever written for an Illumination Entertainment production. Three of my favorite songs are ""Thneedville"", ""How Bad Can I Be?"", and ""Let it Grow"".Even though it does have some very Hollywood-promoted elements in it and marketing that ditches the message of the book, ""The Lorax"" is a fun adaptation of the Dr. Seuss story and perhaps the second best adaptation of the source material after ""Horton Hears a Who!"". Definite recommend for any Dr. Seuss fans out there!",The Lorax
99,thomasmitilis1995,A TREE FALLS THE WAY IT LEANS... BE CAREFUL WHICH WAY YOU LEAN...,4,25 April 2020,"PROS:The Lorax is an enjoyable movie about a world where trees don't exist and everything is made of plastic. Ted (voiced by Zac Efron) begins an adventure to find a tree and impess the girl of his dreams (Taylor Swift). The film underlines the environmental problems and the current state of the society and it is a warning about what is required to be done in order to save the planet. Moreover, it's clear that it criticizes the corporate greed and capitalism through the eyes of the villain, Mr. O'Hare who wants the city without green so he can sell air and make a profit. The animation is solid and resembles the illustrations of Dr. Seuss.CONS:The movie suffers from the way it adresses its messages. It is preachy and doesn't present the environmental issues in a subtle way. Once-ler (Ed Helms) is supposed to never been seen bacause he symbolizes the destruction and the deforestation in Dr. Seuss's illustrations but the movie chooses to take a different path and depicts two stories about greedy industrialists. The ending is totally absurd, especially when the trees start growing in seconds (what's the point of the movie then?). The musical numbers are unbearable and badly placed and the lyrics are unimaginative. Lorax (Dany DeVito) is underdeveloped instead of stealing the show with his attitude. The romantic subplot is completely forced and along with the slapstic humor and the grandma's gags undermine the whole message.",The Lorax

Someone found a way to sell air which was already available for free and people are buying it. The theme is great but the rest of the movie is kind of bad. The Lorax and Wall-E both share the same theme and I think the closest thing to O'Hare Air and BnL is Amazon. The Onceler was so selfish with his own greed that he didn't care what it would do to the environment or others. This represents capitalism and how people care about there own wealth and what is happening in the moment that what it does to the environment and the long term effects. The movie does end on a good note so maybe there is hope for the real world too because global warming is a huge and scary problem that needs to be stopped.Unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot,

104,FFman-847-460126,Devito Can't Save This One,4,2 March 2012,"For a children's film to work, it usually has to cater to both the children and the adult that brings the children to the film. Movies such as Shrek and Wall-E have perfected the tightrope dance that this requires. The Lorax throws that idea right out the window—and suffers considerably in the process. Instead of finding a way to please both audiences within a single storyline, the creators of The Lorax created two parallel stories—one for the adults; another for the children.The children's storyline is very much like the Three Stooges. With the wildlife and terrain that Dr. Seuss provided, the slapstick is obviously enjoyable to the children. But it just keeps going. The same slapstick antics are used time and time again. The lack of creativity is a stain on the honor of Dr. Seuss. With everything that he poured into this world, it shouldn't be too difficult to pour some extra effort into the movie. Right?The adult side of the film is worse. Although the ""save the planet"" storyline is interesting at first, it quickly loses its appeal. By the time the movie is concluding, you will feel like the creators are slapping you. If I wanted to be preached to about how I was destroying the planet, I would tune into Infowars. In the meantime, the storyline progresses haphazardly. The end is absolutely absurd. I found myself hoping for a quick end. On the plus side, my wish was granted.There are a few plus sides to the movie. Danny Devito does a good job in his role of the Lorax. Why Taylor Swift was picked, however, is beyond me. Even her voice shows how lacking her acting ability is. The one part of the movie that still has me confused is the singing. The Lorax starts off with a song. I thought I simply hadn't realized it was a musical. But then there's no more singinguntil halfway through. This movie can't decide if it should be a musical or just a movie. I must say that the songs are catchy. On the other hand, the song about greed will terrify children.The Lorax is not a children's film worth seeing. If you want to see a great children's film with subtle political undertones, watch Wall-E. That movie does everything that The Lorax fails at. 2012 has been an awful year for children's films. Journey 2 was even worse than The Lorax. I hope this trend changes soon. Luckily, there is still ten months left in the year to remedy that problem.reillyreviews.wordpress.com",The Lorax
105,MC1-Bjornson,Get Seuss-Loose,7,13 March 2012,"""Dr. Seuss' The Lorax"", Rated ""PG"" for Mild Peril. Running Time: 1hr&35mns.*** (Out of ****) -- 7 on the IMDb ScaleDr. Seuss is a hot commodity for Hollywood. In the last decade, at least three of his books were made into big-screen live action pictures. Those preceding films boasted excessive budgets with fantastic production values, great special effects, weak scripting and big name comedians layered in prosthetics to ""get them into characters"" that rendered them unrecognizable as actors. ""Dr. Seuss' The Lorax"" is the first film to rely on CGI animators to create the visual look of the characters and the world they inhabit. CGI animated films are nothing new. One would think that the works of Dr. Seuss would have been made into a CGI movie much sooner than now.Though Suess himself had always claimed his books are written without a ""moral of the story"" element, you could have fooled me. If ""The Lorax,"" isn't about environmental conservation and anti-commercialism, then I don't know what is. ""The Lorax"" opens with the idealistic 12-year old Ted (Zac Efron, ""High School Musical""). He secretly desires the acceptance and affection of the lovely Audrey (Taylor Swift) . Ted is willing to do whatever it takes to have Audrey notice him.Ted and Audrey live in the bustling ""Thneed-Ville."" This city has been blocked off from the rest of the world. Its GNP is bottled and canned fresh air. Their world used to be bountiful with fresh air, until all of the trees became extinct. Without trees to generate fresh air, it is now mass produced and marketed by the greedy Aloysius O'Hare (Rob Riggle, ""21 Jump Street""), the wealthy mayor of Thneed-Ville. Upon learning Audrey will only marry someone who would give her a real tree, Ted is on a quest to meet the only man that knows anything about trees: the Once-ler (Ed Helms, ""The Hangover""). He lives in the barren wasteland far beyond the protective walls of Thneed-Ville. The Once-ler agrees to share with Ted in a series of visits the tale of what happened to all the trees. The Once-ler also explains his role in how Thneed-Ville came to be. As a youth, the Once-ler discovered how processing truffula trees could be manufactured into ""Thneeds,"" which can be used for just about anything from fashionable hats to hammocks. No one could live without having a thneed and everyone absolutely had to acquire one. However could anyone live without a thneed?The spokesman for the trees is the two-foot tall, fuzzy orange fellow known as the Lorax (Danny DeVito, ""It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia""). ""I speak for the trees"" he asserts upon his arrival from the sky. The Lorax was opposed to the Once-ler's logging plans to make thneeds for the mass consumers who demand them. The Once-ler originally agreed to not cut down the trees. When his greedy family arrived, he changed his tune for the chance to become the wealthiest man alive. The Lorax and the woodland animals were powerless to prevent the harvesting of the truffalas.Ted is humbled by the Once-ler's account. Ted also ponders the meaning of a message from the Lorax etched on a stone in the Once-ler's yard. ""What does it mean? How does this apply to me today?"" he wonders.The new movie version of ""The Lorax"" is considerably broader in its telling compared to the original children's book. There is more background on the Once-ler and Ted to help transition the material into a full-length feature. As a movie, ""The Lorax"" holds up on its own merits. This film is colorful, detailed and kinetic in its approach. I admired the truffala trees that resembled white birch crossed with cotton candy looking much as they did in Seuss' book. The Lorax himself is a true Seussian creation. This is welcome to see. The previous live-action Seuss-based movies offered comedians Jim Carrey and Mike Myers merely dressed up as Seuss characters, and they channeled themselves and not the characters. This time, the character of the Lorax feels right. Danny DeVito's voicing doesn't go over the top and he is believable.Also refreshing is the sense of innocence in this film. The other big screen Dr. Seuss outings turned off parents with some crude humor and language that was present. ""The Lorax"" is fairly squeaky clean in content, despite its ""PG"" rating. There's no foul language, crude humor or violence. I'm guessing the rating stands for ""mild peril."" Even then, there's nothing objectionable for children or parents in this movie to be concerned about.""The Lorax,"" like the book, has created a stir about its ""eco-message"" and anti-consumerism stance. Charlie Jane Anders of the science fiction site ""io9"" complained ""I'm pretty darn liberal and I still wanted this movie to shut up and stop lecturing me.""Whether ""The Lorax"" is heavy-handed in a message or not, the sub-text of the film did not bother me. I felt it was a pure escapist family feature. ""The Lorax"" is light-hearted romp with bright colors, lively characters, some catchy musical numbers and a happy ending. The message I got was to let the movie entertain its audience. I am sure people can make up their own minds on any messages, perceived or other, that may have been present in ""The Lorax."" Hasn't that always been the case with children's stories?",The Lorax

While I know there are those who will gnash there teeth and automatically discard my review, I just want to provide this as a basis for my critique of the film.I went into this movie with the understanding it was going to be about the environment and how we must work to save it. This is a sentiment I completely agree with; you don't have to believe in global warming (which I do) to understand that our current way of living is unsustainable. What I wasn't prepared for, however, was the complete lack of subtly. This movie was a juvenile attempt at being crafty. This isn't a ""Fox news"" style sniping, picking a single scene of the movie out of context or reading too deeply looking for a hidden subtext. It's blatantly out there, before the end of the first song. After that, the movie was filled with shallow characters that were Ayn Rand styled mouthpieces for the films agenda. What makes it frustrating is the Dr. Seuss has never been this mean spirited. Dr. Seuss' political leanings have never been hidden, but they never detracted from my enjoyment of it.What bothered me most was the lack of true heart in the movie. ""Wall-E"" had a very similar message a few years ago, yet that movie was a beautiful piece of art. It's message was plainly visible, and I'm sure it was hounded by hardcore conservatives when it was released. But it came from a place of understanding and cooperation in working together to save the environment and where everyone had the potential to make a difference in the end. The Lorax was just pretentious and condescending in its execution; you are demonized if you do not buy into the film maker's world view wholesale.On a technical level, the animation was on par with the very Seuss-ian style that was presented in ""Horton Hears A Who""; its detail was just right while it kept that Dr. Seuss charm. The voice actors filled their roles well; Ed Helms charmed as the Once-ler, imbuing pathos to an otherwise stale character, while Danny DeVito gave the Lorax a charming, world weary sarcasm that fit very well. The music was very well done. I found myself tapping along to the music, while the lyrics were very obvious and pandering.Ultimately, this movie was held back by its execution; there was nothing wrong with its message or with the source material. But, its arrogant style was polarizing and distracting. If you believe that the world is simply black and white, where everyone is either a mindless sheeple or evil industrialist, you will genuinely enjoy this movie.

When a young boy, Ted (Zac Efron) falls for a girl, Audrey (Taylor Swift) who lives down the street, there's just about nothing he wouldn't do to capture her heart. They live in a town called ""Theneedvile"" that has no trees. They rely on store bought tree replicas which don't have the benefits of photosynthesis that produces fresh air. The town's zillionaire, O'Hare (Rob Riggle) made his fortune on this fact by selling bottled fresh air with his ""O'Hare Air"" products.When she shows him a mural of trees that she painted in her backyard and tells him that she would marry the first guy that brought her a tree, or ""Trufulla"", it turns Ted's world into a frenzy as he focuses on where to get a real tree for her. His grandmother, Norma (Betty White) remembers a time when trees were plentiful and tips him off on where to find out how to obtain a tree. Ted ventures off to see the only one person that can help him, ""The Once-ler"" (Ed Helms) who lives high above the devastated, grey and barren land without fresh air that he is responsible for.As a young man, ""The Once-ler"" harvested the Trufulla trees to use their colorful, cotton-candy like textured tops to make ""Thneeds"", a product that can be used at fill any human need- a scarf, an umbrella, a hat, even a tight-rope. His pitch tag-line is ""everyone needs a Thneed"". With the first chopping-down of a Trufulla tree, brings ""The Lorax"" (Danny DeVito) the guardian of the forest who warns the Once-Ler to stop his greedy commence, anti-environmentalist ways.""Dr. Seuss' The Lorax"" is a great reminder to children of the importance of conservation and preserving mother nature and animals. In the Dr Seuss' case, it's the Humming-Fish, Swomee-Swans, and Brown Bar-ba-loots bears that thrive in the natural Thneedville land.The colorful palettes used in ""Dr. Seuss The Lorax"" is very true to the classic picture books I remember as a child.

111,khfan250,"If you can look past the preachy environmental message, you'll find a good movie.",7,10 March 2012,"I was hesitant to go see this movie opening weekend. I heard some pretty negative stuff about it, so I basically avoided it. But today, I forked up $7.50 for a ticket to watch Dr. Seuss' The Lorax, and, of course, I left the theater surprised.I guess I'll talk about the bad stuff first. And this is a problem with all of the movies based off of the books of Dr. Seuss: they are so padded out. I guess they're just trying to fill the hour- and-a-half mark, but really, they could do this by developing the characters a bit more. But instead they just throw a ton of cutesy-schmootsty bull crap at the screen. It honestly gets a bit tiring after a while.As you are probably aware, this movie was made by the same team that brought us Despicable Me, and it really shows in this movie. Remember the Minions from that movie that met the halfway mark between cute and annoying? This movie has a similar cast of characters that do the exact same stick. It really distracts from the story when every fifteen minutes there's bears and fish singing in high, squeaky voices.And, of course, the biggest issue with this movie is the preachy, drawn out environmental message. Many reviews that I've read say that this is what destroys this movie, but i don't think so. I think the message is important for kids, and arguably adults, to learn, but here it's really tiresome.Okay, so those are my issues with this movie, so now here's the good stuff (because, honestly, there's a lot). Just like in Horton Hears A Who, the illustrations from Dr. Seuss' book transitions from the page to the big screen very nicely. The atmosphere, the colors, and the lighting in this movie just pop. I didn't see this one in 3-D, but I hear great things about it.The characters in this movie are a lot of fun. Danny DeVito and Ed Helms are delightfully boated and over-the-top; they really make this movie for me. Zac Efron and Taylor Swift aren't as good as DeVito or Helms, but they're okay. Betty White gets a good pun every now and again, while the rest of the side characters are good as well.The songs are actually really great. Heck, I didn't even know this was a musical until I heard about it from a friend. But seriously, these are friggin' awesome songs! They're catchy, bouncy, and energetic; what else do you need in a good family flick?Final verdict: While I don't think this is as bad as critics are saying it is, I do understand why they don't like it. The problems I listed before are major, but I think the other stuff is just too dang good. If you're looking for a good family night out or if you're a fan of Despicable Me, check this out and see for yourself if it's good or not.",The Lorax

When I saw this in the cinema in 2D, it was alright but let me down a little bit. It was a bit strange but it got better. Like most Dr Seuss books and films they are unusual. There's a bit of adult humour in it. They made the Dr Seuss environment just like the version in the book. They really made the lorax look interesting with enormous blue eyes and yellow moustache. Although I couldn't really remember the full story they've made a few changes. The character Aloysius O'Hare really reminds you of Ken Jeong. The background and characters' animation are tiny bit different to 'Despicable Me' but have the same brightness and colour as it. It's more of a fairy tale animation and background to 'Despicable Me'. It's fun for the whole family.",The Lorax

117,antoniomagallon90,Its a cute movie,7,19 March 2012,"The town of Thneed-Ville is made up of plastic, literary. There's no grass, no trees, etc. The town's mayor O'Hare (Rob Riggle) loves to spy on his fellow citizens and does not let them to get out of the city. Ted Wiggins (Zac Efron) is an eighth grader who happens to be in love with Audrey (Taylor Swift), who is in high school. She is a naturalist and wants to see a real tree. Ted just can't resist after all he is in love people. Grandma Nora (Betty White) tells Ted to see Once-ler (Ed Helms) because he is the only person who knows the trees better than anybody else. He goes out of town and visits Once-ler, but he psychically can't see him due to the fact that he locks himself up for a good reason. He tells the story about the encounter with the Lorax (Danny DeVito) who is the guardian of the trees and nature.The Lorax animation has resembles of Dr. Seuss' drawing, which is nice to see. The film has talented voice actors, partially Betty White, who delivers the best dialogue and has most of the humor. The animals are cute, practically the cubbies, however one thing that bugs me is that the fishes walks in the grass, which is awkward to see, but then again this is a kid's movie, which I let it slide. The Lorax does deliver good humor and good jokes. The last half of the movie focuses with real life issues about the environment. I do understand about the environmental protection issues, but at the same time I was already lecture about the issue I'm not saying its bad, what I'm trying to say here is that it was pointless in my opinion, but once again this is a kids movie and they need to understand the issue. None of the musical is memorable because it's not great compare to some of Disney classics that I grew up. Plus it didn't catch my attentionOverall The Lorax is cute and funny to watch. While some will be touch about the environment themes, others will simply be annoy by it because were already taught by it. In the end The Lorax is simply entertaining and it is worth seeing.B-",The Lorax
118,rehan_abbasi93,A good film.........,8,15 August 2012,"I cant believe all the negative reviews here, Lorax was a good film. The animation is top notch, fun to look at and lively. The animals (bears and the fish) are cute and the film has a powerful message. This is not a comedy film as i was expecting it to be (as nearly all the animated films released these days have quite a bit of comedy ). the tone of the film is actually sad ( its about environmentalism and cutting down trees and their impact on the ecosystem).Surely the villain and his scheme is a little bit silly and the voice acting is so-so (except for the girl which i later found to be voiced by Taylor swift) and the film gets a little boring at times, the film overall is very good.A 7/10 from me.",The Lorax

I know that kids are easily entertained, but here's a thought, when you make a movie, HAVE A POINT! The Lorax meandered through it's thin storyline like a teenage girl through the mall on a Saturday afternoon, stopping everywhere just to ""look at stuff"". The best lines of the movie were blurted during all of the previews for weeks ahead of time, and they had no more. The main character wasn't interesting and I saw several children fast asleep clutching their soda or candy. The best thing about this movie will end up being the fact that harried parent's will be able to put it on at bedtime, guaranteed that their little one will indeed be asleep shortly.",The Lorax

But this movie was really REALLY hard to sit through. Granted, its a movie geared towards children and as I am a teenage girl but even though, There are definitely timeless children's movies that I still love and make me smile I watch them today. There is nothing timeless about this movie. There are no cool quirks about it or any catchy songs that get stuck in your head. In fact as soon as the first song came on I felt like hiding under my seat for making my friend come to the movie. All the songs were absolutely unbearable and over the top. We started groaning every time they started to sing. Even the all- star cast couldn't save this. The only couple good things about this movie was the colorful graphics and the lorax himself. Maybe if you were a young child it would be different.",The Lorax
121,cgrill8,Decent movie to help brainwash the young'uns,3,5 March 2012,"I took my 3 year old to see this, while my wife took my 7 year old to see The Secret World of Arrietti. I wish I saw the Ghibli movie instead. This movie can give young kids all the wrong impressions on capitalism, the simple satisfying way of earning money through hard work, and being made to think all companies are big, bad and evil!? I can see the movie's point, which was more extreme than the book I might add, but it rubbed it into the ground until the dirt was gone and all you could see was ugly clay. The plastic jokes were funny, but there seemed to be no threat to the characters at ALL, they cough on rare occasion and would open an air bottle akin to Spaceballs on occasion, but that was it, nothing a Halls cough drop would cure. I love Pom Poko, and like Wall-E, but this was rub it in your face environmentalism than I have EVER seen done in a children's film. Funny thing is, when Seuss published The Lorax America was much more self sufficient back then than we are now. We had more steel, metal and industrial companies compared to what we have now. The red haze over industrial cities are gone, as well as are the products which are made mainly over seas now. Was this movie made for third world countries? And when I have to explain to my son how more forests are taken down mainly due to housing projects and more and more garden (Cookie cutter) homes with itty bitty yard is more of a culprit for missing woods and forests, while we have many empty houses elsewhere (like our own personal neighborhood) and even more half empty strip malls every 3/4 mile around us. I'll agree we're a wasteful society, but to make it out the whole world hinges on one seed...seems a bit much to me. People are planting trees and gardens and greenery all the time. Dustructive weather seems to be doing a better job of taking down trees right now than any company I know of. Plus those ""smiling pretty kids"" (that can't act and only read cue cards) over at Disney Channel seem to be planting plenty of trees over and over on their commercials with the FLOTUS. Let them do it. But while the Lorax looked the part, the movie looked good, sounded good, but it was so focused on plot, the characters seemed to lack some depth especially one connection they made obvious near the end, but didn't even resolve. If you're not a tree hugger, pass on this one. And the only thing that was memorable for my 3 year old was the same scene we saw on the trailer... the whole ""THIS is a woman!?"" line, and the poor Lorax was treated like Beetlejuice, his use was lacking over-all as well. The main point I could get out of this movie was and old man tricking a young boy to do something illegal(escaping town over and over) so the old man could see the boy every day and tell him stories... there's something a little sick about that to me too... but the graphical representation was pure Seuss to the end and that at least looked great, just wish the movie's plot had been a little better.",The Lorax

The writing is bad, the casting is bad, the songs are the worst thing about the picture. The CGI is great, but of course, that is all done by computer algorithms written by other people who do a great job. Danny Devito's voice is very annoying, but then I've always felt that way. I was expecting more after such a great production as Despicable me, but then that is probably the only good thing that universal has ever done. In fact, NBC has also gone far down hill.

I was pleasantly surprised to see the movie promoted a green lifestyle with an emphasis on trees. In addition, there was more humor in the movie than was portrayed in the commercials. I wish the promoters would've included the cute singing fish, or the short and hilarious looking billionaire.

The newest Seuss book to be adapted to film happens to be one of the great author's works that I enjoyed the most growing up, the Lorax. The first thing you'll notice about this film is the animation. The colors are bright and vibrant, and the animation is excellent. Another bright spot in the film is the musical numbers, the songs are catchy and creative and add a nice spice to the movie. The main thing about the movie though, is that it follows the book loosely. It is by no means a direct adaptation, but keeps the key plot elements while remaining a modern-day animated kids movie. Fans of the book shouldn't be disappointed, I certainly wasn't. I left the theater feeling satisfied and proud that one of my favorite Seuess stories was done justice on the big screen, as so many animated films don't deliver. But this is one worth seeing, and will be enjoyed by everyone from the youngest of Seuess fans to the very oldest.Overall: 7/10",The Lorax

I couldn't tell you how many times I've watched this movie. The songs in this movie are really catchy, and really good. Every time I watch this movie, I sing along to the song, because by god they are so good. The environmental part of the movie is kind of preachy and out of place, and some of the characters, like Tim's girlfriend are so un memorable I cannot even try to remember their names. O'Hare is a really good villain though, and you can really get dragged into his sequences, and the onceler is not bad either, though some parts of his backstory seem kind of... off.. to say the least.

And the fact that they showed his face tells me that the filmmakers completely missed the intention of the book.The ending is all messed up and has no impact, unlike the ambiguous ending of the original. The song at the end when the whole town joins the boy to plant the tree takes almost no convincing. Their transition feels too forced. That's how these songs work, they never feel justified and come out of nowhere. Then with the Lorax coming back? How does that make the story resonate at all?Sure there is a lot of fluff out there that kids can easily watch and enjoy. There's no harm in that. But the fact that this movie is based on a meaningful, classic source, it just comes across as insulting. This movie's goal was to pander to the mainstream audience instead of bringing a timeless tale to life. The truth of the story is completely covered by this movie's extremist approach.No matter what Hollywood tries to do with these stories, people are always going to return to the books of Dr. Seuss.

129,billosaurus,A solid if flawed adaptation.,6,7 May 2017,"I have just watched this movie earlier this evening, and i was expecting utter tripe. But, I actually found it watchable.This movie is heavily bashed, and yeah, it isn't a perfect movie. Its trendy, it'll become dated, and the message is hammered into your skull. I think really, though, it didn't do a terrible job of adapting the book, and the message is still pretty well emulated here. Humanity appears to be restricted to a single walled city known as Thneedville, a false utopia akin to judge dread. The ecosystem has long ago collapsed, and oxygen is subsequently manufactured in factories, and is thus commercialised. Living here is ted, his presumably widowed mother and also probable widow grandma Norma. Every several months, ted buys a new toy to crash into the garden of his crush, Audrey. Audrey informs ted that she is obsessed with trees, and she'd marry anyone who could get her one. Despite not caring about trees, ted thinks Audrey looks hot, so he decides to hunt for one. Thankfully, grandma Norma knows of a hermit, the onceller, who might know something about them. Ted sneaks out of the poorly guarded city, and ventures into the smoggy neighbouring wasteland, barely avoiding decapitation from the ocean of axe-wielding deactivated robots. He meets the insane onceller, who tells ted snippets of his past over the course of a few days, conveniently, so that the movie can cut back to ted and Audrey and not shift all their screen time onto the onceller and the lorax. The onceller and his mule, Melvin, ravage the habitat of the adorably marketable barbaloots, swamy-swans and amphibious humming 'fish.' While he tried to be sustainable, his evil family show up and push him into going full-blown industrialist, destroying the entire forest, and running his business into the ground. Years later, a new villain rises. The tyrannical Aloysius O'Hare, who sells air. He isn't too happy about trees making a comeback, and since ted has listened to the onceller and gotten a truffula tree seed off the old man, O'Hare will do anything he can to stop him. After a surprisingly good chase, ted plants the seed, and nature returns. What DAMNS this movie is the overly positive ending. The book left on a cliffhanger, and this new ending was clearly happy. This removed the mystery and cliffhanger of the book. That said, the movie is colourful, harmless, it isn't horrible nor does it have any bad messages. Its got mostly juvenile humour, as a 22 year old, I didn't get much of a laugh from it. In fact, my 53 year old dad enjoyed it more than I did. There isn't much to it that challenges or entertain adults, but if you have kiddywinks that want to watch something Dr Seuss based, then this is not a bad choice. It has bright colours, lots of jokes, and a nicely done message about the importance of deep ecology. It really is a true kids film, don't expect any clever jokes or sharp wit, like, say, DreamWorks, Disney or Pixar.",The Lorax

131,matitya-33937,It's a decent film.,7,14 June 2021,"Of the Dr. Seuss movie adaptations, the best is probably Horton Hears a Who. And I'm not claiming that the Lorax is a great movie but it's not a bad one either.Alusyus O'Hare, who learned to sell air and became a Zillionaire, is an underwhelming villain. I didn't dislike the subplot where Ted and Audrey have to expose him but I didn't love it either. I like that it enables a happy ending since I like happy endings but I find it falls flat in comparison to the story of The Onceler.And I actually liked The Onceler storyline quite a bit. I like how The Onceler seeks to try and prove his oppressive family is wrong in their insistence that he'll never come to anything by becoming an inventor and creating the Thneed which becomes a successful invention leading to them re-embracing The Onceler leading to his seeking to retain their affections by creating as many Thneeds as he possibly can.I like how The Onceler insists on being optimistic despite his upbringing since it helps him make him a likeable albeit naïve character.I like how The Onceler is genuinely conflicted about his breaking his promise to The Lorax not to destroy the environment to enrich himself but still chooses to go through with reneging on it to retain familial approval.I like how The Onceler's Villain Song ""How Bad Can I Be? I'm Just Doing What Comes Naturally"" is about how he cannot possibly be a Villain and how the song becomes a montage to his morphing an increasingly antagonistic character and throughout the song demonstrating every bad thing he is doing ""The customers are buying, and the money is multiplying, and the PR people are lying, who cares if a few trees are dying"" he is still vehemently insisting that he's not a bad guy ""How bad can I be? Can't you see me petting this puppy? How bad can I be? A portion of proceeds goes to charity"" demonstrating that he is willfully blind to the deleterious nature of his actions.And when the entire forest is destroyed, his business is kaput, his family has forsaken him, the animals have departed and The Lorax has left, The Onceler looks up the devastation he's caused to the environment and is justly horrified by it. To the point where he wallows in remorse ever since. The Onceler is a tragic figure.And I like how the film, (admittedly implicitly) deals with the economic insanity of destroying your entire supply of raw materials (instead of replanting every tree you cut down to sustain them) by having The Onceler not be as savvy a businessman as he thinks he is.This is a children's movie and as such there is a certain level of comedy and without pretending it's the height of humour produced by Illumination Entertainment, I don't think that they do too bad a job.As a musical the majority of songs in it (Thneedville, Everyone Needs a Thneed, Let it Grow) were underwhelming but How Bad Can I Be Was Pretty Good.Was this a perfect movie? Not by a long shot. Was it a great movie? I wouldn't say so. That said, all in all, it's a decent film.",The Lorax

133,weathergirl98,A story within a story...and both are good.,9,25 May 2012,"Making a movie for this short story was definitely a major risk-taker, but the producers, in my mind, achieved every aspect of the story we grew know and love. The animation was spot on, both realistic and playful. Designs was everything Suess, from the strange shaped buildings to harmonizing goldfish. The characters were wonderful, Zac Efron and Taylor Swift delivering very believable scenes, despite the odd pairing.The movie begins in a town called Thneedville, a city built on the foundation of everything metal, plastic, and the sort, without any natural things in the surroundings. A young boy, Ted, has fallen for Audrey, a curious girl who dreams to one day see a real tree. Driven by his passion, he soon receives advice from his grandmother to visit an older man who goes by The Once-ler, who resides alone in the outskirts of the city. Ted does this, and is then subjected to an interesting tale of an average man whose own greed eventually led to his own demise. Despite the constant warning of The Lorax, a legendary creature who speaks for the trees, the young Once-ler ignored him, and in time, destroyed all of the trees and drove out all of the creatures living around them. Over the course of several days, Ted soon realizes that the own mayor, Mr. O'Hare, is working to continue the environmental collapse in order to not only gain millions, but also win the hearts of civilians with bottled air. Despite the harsh consequences, Ted accepts a gift from the Once-ler- a single seed that will begin an entire new world of trees. In the end, Ted places the seed in the center of Thneedville, winning over Audrey and the acceptance of the town people. You last see the Once-ler emerge from his home, now surrounded by the the sprouting of several trees. The Lorax visits him, giving him a hug and finally offering forgiveness.I've seen many negative reviews for this movie, but keep in mind that this film was aiming at a younger audience, but it is still excellent for the older crowd. It is a major environmental film that proves the harsh reality of human brutality, a very controversial topic even today. Also, movies like these are usually taken differently by various viewers, but as long as you don't compare the movie to the original story of The Lorax, this new adaption is actually very good. It has its moments of humor, romance, music, suspense, and morality, and is a definite crowd pleaser. 9/10. You won't regret watching it.",The Lorax
134,dmorrisbadger101,Laugh-Out-Loud Movie,10,18 September 2012,"I saw this movie in the theater and I really enjoyed it. It's about a world where everyone has fake trees. All the real trees were removed and taken away to a rural area with meadows and beautiful birds and plants. One kid that always wanted a tree decided to hike to a land where a make- believe creature lived and told him the story of the last real tree. So he continues walking to the beautiful farmland and saw thousands of real trees. But, he turned a bit evil. He started to cut down every single tree in the meadow. You see, he did that so that he could transplant a tree to his backyard. It was a very funny story that turned out to have a good ending. By the way, in the end, he had a REAL tree in his backyard. So now you know the story of The Lorax. It was a great story that took place in a land far away!",The Lorax
135,mattwebster077,I was embarrassed watching it,1,3 January 2014,"Why did they make this film? It's pants! Seriously though, who would want to watch a film about a boy who goes out to get a ""real"" tree just to get some girl? It's stupid! The beginning song (a song about their town ""Sneedville"" or something like that) is annoying and stupid and the townspeople can't sing and makes Alvin and the chipmunks sound not annoying. I was actually embarrassed watching it! It's an insult to Dr Seuss fans. You WILL be insulted by watching this if you are a Dr Seuss fan because it is pointless, rubbish, pants, embarrassing and just a load of junk. This film just ruined Danny DeVito's career and I am sorry for him. Only watch it if you are aged from 3years to 6years. If you are not, DO NOT WATCH! If you watch it and it is sooooo bad, don't tell me I didn't warn you.....",The Lorax
136,Phracture,Highly Overrated!,2,28 February 2013,"Even as it stands on this and other review sites, The Lorax is highly overrated. It's colorful. It's got action... That's pretty much all it has going for it. I'd bet that even small children will find it forgettable with so much better fare available.The characters are dull, and highly underdeveloped. All mystery and mood has been drained from the book. Instead it is a film of lively colorful action for action's sake. The voice characterizations are so-so. The plot meanders all over the map, steering clear of Seuss's material whenever possible. Even the fanciful nature of Seuss's artwork has mostly been purged here. The few musical numbers are dumb and unmemorable and feel like a substitute for good plotting.The environmental message stands out fairly distractingly and starkly because there's so little else here to focus on. Apparently ""Despicable Me"" was a pleasant fluke for these folks.",The Lorax
137,reckno,Guiltiest of guilty pleasures,7,17 June 2020,"If I am being completely objective, this movie is probably deserving of a 5 or 6. It's not the absolute dumpster fire many critics say it is, but it still misses the mark on so many levels. But at the end of the day, this is a movie I enjoyed.You probably don't need me to explain what is objectively ""wrong"" with this movie, but I will sum it up briefly: It is heavily modernized and the message got really muddled in making an hour long adaptation. They added a character whose sole purpose was to be a villain, and contradicted the ""anyone can turn into a Once-ler"" message by giving the actual Once-ler a face in this movie (and apparently spawning a fanbase of sorts.......). It also doesn't help that there were dozens of product tie-ins advertised when the movie came out which just proved how much a sellout Illumination was....and still is.So why do I still give it an 8/10? Because I thoroughly enjoy this film each time I see it. I dare say it is one of Illumination's finer films alongside the first Despicable Me (certainly better than Minions, Secret Life of Pets 1 and 2, and even Sing in my opinion...) It is probably one of the if not THE only Illumination film to feature originally written and performed songs. And I actually liked a majority of them! You can thank composer John Powell who has worked on many other animated movies with good soundtracks, so you can be assured the music in this movie is pretty good! The musical/lyric songs are also decent, and I particularly enjoyed the opening song (Thneedville) and final number (Let it Grow). Both of which are readily available on Youtube.I also really like the animation and voice acting. Even the worst of Illumination movies are still somewhat pleasant to look at, but I found The Lorax movie to be their most visually pleasing. Maybe that's just because it's done in the style of Dr. Seuss, who has an aesthetically pleasing art style but my point still stands. As for the voice acting, I was particularly satisfied with Danny Devito's performance as the orange guy himself, but I also enjoyed Ed Helms as the Once-ler, Zac Efron as Ted Wiggins (""Ted"" being named after Ted Geisel, Dr. Seuss' real name), and of course Betty White as Granny Norma!!! Will always give props to Betty White and her performances! :DAnd then there's the story of this movie, which is where most are divided. I did indeed grow up reading the book, and it always upset me at how depressing and bleak it was (as it should; that was the point after all). This movie sort of provided the closure I strongly desired as a kid, and I really REALLY loved that about it when I first saw it in theaters at 14 yrs old 8 years ago. Basically the movie has a ""happy ending"" which somewhat ruined the message of the original story. It doesn't completely """"ruin"""" the message of the book, but it is slightly weaker as a result, and the movie is generally criticized for the ending. While I certainly agree with the criticism, I will always have a soft spot for how this movie ended. It still puts a smile on my face every time I see the Lorax and Once-ler hug it out. :)Along with Dr. Seuss very famous quote ""Unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot, nothing is going to get better. It's not...."" this showed there was some care put into this movie adaptation, even if it was muddled. Effort was put into the writing in some spots so that the movie doesn't lose Seuss' message in its entirety. And I respect that.....well kind of. Would've been better if they had kept the message as strong as the book though.I also didn't really mind O'Hare as a villain. His motivation makes sense, and even adds some comic relief during his scenes. I enjoyed him, along with Rob Riggle as his voice.Overall this movie is generally a miss in the public eye, but it firmly falls under the guilty pleasure category for me. I enjoyed the songs, the message, the animation, and even some of the jokes got a laugh out of me. This is certainly one of the less good animated movies of the decade (I mean how can this compare to the beauty and wonder of Coco, Spiderverse, Inside Out, etc?) but I find it to be better than most people say. Definitely read the book first before watching the movie and decide for yourself!",The Lorax

I know, the impression depends on the person who watches the movie, I am just yet another point of view on the big planet. Mini-romance around and stuff...never mind. There's an environmental message, it is clear, though this is dual-sided. Ofc, we ppl shoulldn't destroy nature, but, well, let's be honest, most mistakes are not just intentional destruction of things that 'd come in handy to us or other people.

141,ronggur-silalahi,"There are changes, but it was pretty well done for all ages",6,19 November 2013,"Being a little man, Danny DeVito voiced pretty good for ""little"" characters, for example Phil from Disney Hercules. In 2012 he returned as the Lorax, which another role he played well. The Lorax has a classic story line that no one should doubt. However, the director made it seemed a little ""modern"". Knowing that the story was released in 1971, somehow I see the directors Chris Renaud and Kyle Bald changed little things from what they have on the story book. One is the language, total difference in time and just how the Thneed-Ville looks a little like tiny Hollywood. Secondly, the jokes, totally updated and i see the purpose is to attract audience's attention, otherwise the movie would be dead and boring. Lastly is the character the Once-ler, voiced by the talented Ed Helms. In the story book, the only thing readers know about the Once-ler are is his arms. They never show his face in the book, regardless the young or the old Once-Ler. Well i guess it's time to delete children's curiosity by adding his whole body and face in the movie. The voice talents however, are surprisingly amusing. Knowing that Zac Efron, Taylor Swift, and Ed Helms were not really famous for at least a decade, they were doing as great job as voice actors. Although it's most likely a kid's movie, it's totally something to watch when you want feel entertained.",The Lorax
142,toddkvamme,Insulting to any reasonable viewer,2,3 March 2012,"My boy liked this movie. He is 6 years old. His favorite part was when the Lorax says to the fat lady ""You're a woman?!?!"" And that about summed up the show for him. This movie demonizes corporate culture as the blackest of black...and beatifies the environmental movement as the whitest of white. There is no gray here and if I had not been with my son, I would have walked out and asked for my money back. I had to spend a few minutes at bedtime tonight explaining to my boy that what the movie was really saying is that there is a good way to run a company and a bad way to run a company. The man in the movie did not run his company right because he did not shepherd his resources appropriately. Not ALL companies are bad though...I had to explain. I am appalled that this movie forced me to do that. I don't care how the story is in the book...this movie was an iron fist in a velvet glove. I don't remember all the lyrics...very few of them actually...but you could write an entire review on the ""Bad"" song. During that song, the poster on the wall in the background with ""Too Big to Fail"" written on it was totally unnecessary. Don't get me wrong...I am not defending the moral failure of the people who ran the economy into the ground in 2008 because of their inability to control their greed...I am simply saying that the message of this story could have been told in a far more intelligent manner...for the benefit of the adults and kids. The only reason I gave this movie 2 stars is...well...I am not sure why. The animation is nice...but that's about it. Give me WALL-E any day of the week. This movie was terrible.",The Lorax

However, the dialog was not nearly as sharp as the book. The writers could have had some real fun with the dialog. There was no development of grandma (Betty White), the Lorax (Danny DeVito) or anyone. The ""That's a woman!!"" comment from the Lorax that you see in the preview is all the humor.",The Lorax
144,mariantambe,It's not satesfying,6,6 October 2020,"A couple things just rubbed me wrong.
1. The plastic town in the beginning is shown to function perfectly fine without plants. People are happy and their needs are met with no visible downside. The animals are already dead from events that occured years prior. If humanity can function that well without nature, what's the point of trees?( Not that I'm antitree in the real world, but that's the real world, that's not what were shown)
2. Apparently, someone only cared about trees to impress a girl. So yeah, again in the world of the Lorax trees are real important. Like a fad.
3. The Lorax nearly drowns the Onceler before he starts chopping down loads of trees in an effort to get him to leave, but does nothing but talk once the actual destroying the environment thing begins.
4. The seed grew to a sapling in less than a day? If that's the case why didn't the Onceler replant the forest he destroyed instead of waiting years for some lovesick youth to take the seed back to town?",The Lorax
145,geny82,The kids like it,9,17 September 2012,"We saw this movie as part of a summer program that shows movies outdoors in the park. It was a perfect movie for this. All the kids seemed to love it. Since it was outdoors instead of a theater, no one minded when the kids got up to dance through the songs. We have of course watched movies at home with our 10 month old, but not in theaters. It might have just been the fact we were outside, but I think he might have sat through it in a theater as well. He was clapping his hands and smiling the whole time. My 6 year old loved it too, and got the message. There is one song that sounds up beat, but if you listen to the words it's kind of a downer. On the way home he was singing it, then stopped and said ""well that's kind of sad."" My 3 year old niece was with us too, and she hardly sits still for anything, but this movie did the trick. I'm not sure if she got the message behind it all, but she was entertained. I have read the book, so has my son. We both noticed the changes, but they weren't so drastic that we were horribly offended. I have read they director/producer's reasons for the changes, and I agree with them.",The Lorax
146,drewmeister11,"The Lorax himself is fun, but the movie itself is a let down.",5,2 March 2012,"I went to see this movie with two girl friends of mine. Throughout the movie, one of them kept groaning and sighing at the same parts I did. The other later accused us of never having been kids. I think they might both be right.If you were ever a child, you are probably familiar with Doctor Seuss's 'The Lorax', a tale of a world where man's greed and selfishness has eradicated all the trees in favor of their escapist man-made town. It's a charming yet somewhat depressing book as the main character realizes what he's destroyed, yet leaves a glimmer of hope at the end as he passes off the last tree seed to a young boy to plant. As a kid, I loved the bittersweet end, as it got the message across and made me want to care about preserving nature.The movie, on the other hand, left me thoroughly unimpressed. Let me get the good parts out of the way first. Naturally, the art style is fantastic and whimsical, as all Seuss work is. Danny Devito does a great job as the Lorax, and I feel it's pretty safe to say that the parts of the story actually focusing on the Lorax himself were indeed enjoyable. That is, with the exception of a badly placed musical number, which makes any sorrow at the trees being destroyed seem diluted. You should be upset that the Lorax leaves us, but I was more upset that I WASN'T upset. Unfortunately, the part of the story focusing on the boy trying to find a tree was tiresome. It's a case where the book was more dramatic than the story - nature had been ravaged, and nobody cared about it except for one boy. In the movie, it's basically all because of some horribly stereotyped evil characters - Once-ler himself is painted as naive but still a good person, but the creators apparently didn't want him to seem corrupt in chopping down all the trees so they have his redneck family do it for him. And the business tycoon Mr. O-Hare is just ridiculously evil. I'm not going to say that big businessmen shouldn't be villains or anything like that , but the point of the original book was that all of mankind had stopped caring, whereas the movie says it's the fault of Once-ler and O'hare entirely, the latter of who deliberately is keeping people clueless about trees. I just feel the ending would have been far more dramatically appropriate if, instead of having a cliché'd (and underwhelming) chase scene where he shows everybody O'hare is evil, if he instead needed to actually CONVINCE people that trees were worth caring about (he convinces them by knocking down a wall at the end. Apparently in the last 15 or so years nobody had even once looked outside.) Additionally, when he finally plants the seed, all the other trees start growing again. Not sure how, but it makes me wonder - if that's all it took, why didn't Once-ler try to plant the seed 15 years ago?Also, they throw in a 'hip grandmother' pretty much entirely because they know grandparents will be taking their kid. At one point the romantic interest actually says 'Wow, how cool is your grandmother'. This bothered me for some reason. Perhaps because I have no soul.Also, it's apparently a musical, something that the ads failed to mention. I'm not against musicals, but the combined fact that 1.) i wasn't prepared for that (Despicable Me, their previous movie, had none) and 2.) the music was... bland. I can't remember any of it and i just got out 20 minutes ago. Also, as I said earlier, one musical number completely ruins the tragic mood it tried to set with the trees getting chopped down.I know that it can be hard translating a Seuss book, usually with only 20 or 30 pages, into a feature film is a tough task. But honestly, if you don't even get the theme right then you have failed in your task. Lorax is enjoyable in a lot of parts, but the parts that aren't AREN'T. Final verdict: 5/10. Your kids might like it, but the uninspired music, botched ending, and boring finale are real game breakers.",The Lorax

149,mormonhippie,Well told story with a good message...,9,26 March 2012,"I have to admit, when I read the gag-line ""Frome the creators of Despicable Me"" I was apprehensive. I didn't find Despicable Me particularly entertaining. The humor: Luckily this movie makes it work. There are a ton of points where the humor could have been overdone and gotten too cheesy, but I can only think of one point where it actually did this. (It involved Ted's Mom, mom makes kid embarrassed...kind of fits.) the rest of the humor was spot on. The animation: The animation is beautiful, and there are a lot of details I noticed the second time watching. You can tell they put a lot of thought into little things that would visually convey concepts in the story. (Think Ted's tee shirt color at the end, and the price of tomatoes)Story line: They do a great job of expanding on the original work. As a child, I have a vague memory of a guy with green hands and yellow eyes who lives at the top of a tower. The explanation of who that man is and how he got there was probably the most touching part of the movie for me. It's a story of greed, corruption, guilt, redemption (Whoa, did I just make this story sound epic?)Voice acting: Unlike previous Dr. Suess movie adaptations, the actors in this film could really project personality into the animated figures. This is particularly true of The Lorax (if they had chosen someone whiny, I don't think I would have liked him much, but because he came off as a tough guy who cared about something I found he was a character I could take seriously)The music: Kudos to the storytellers for using original songs for the story, instead of overused 70-80s songs for the characters to sing off-key. There are three big musical numbers and smaller songs throughout. This is probably the first time I've enjoyed music this much in a non-Disney movie.The Liberals are going to hate it because it doesn't push their agenda enough. The Conservatives are going to say it's liberal propaganda because it involves environmental impact issues. The truth is ""The Lorax"" Movie (unlike the book) is less about the agenda then it is about the message. And that's a good thing.",The Lorax

I can never shake off the feeling of not finishing something that I have started that can be easily finished. The halted story also haunts me on my quiet times, so I would naturally come back to it. But for Lorax, I could easily pause it and never come back. I can put it in a box and stuff it in a a corner in the attic and never look back ever again and I'd be fine with it. The only reason why I was able to finish this god-awful movie was because the internet was down and I was bored to tears.I regretted the very moment I pressed play. I now had to waste my precious time and brain cells.

Zues book non of us had read.Turns out everyone in the movie lives in a land of plastic ( they have fake trees that go disco, fake grass, fake flowers), lives in a smog infested place, and pays for clean air refills from the Mr. O'Hare.We learn the young hero of the day Ted (voiced by Zac Efron) wants to date a girl, who is into trees(the real kind) and decides to set outside of the city limit into the unknown to find her one. He meets up with the Once-ler who tells him the sad story about what happened to the real trees and perhaps an way to change things.I thought the movie was great, we don't often get many environmentally friendly movies (All i can dredge up is fern gulley). Yes there were a couple singing numbers, but they weren't so bad,and were done in typical Dr. Zeus style (which is why we went to see it, is it not?). Some exciting CGI, and the voices were great.

I giggled, snorted, hooted and cackled. It's funny! Whimsical! Kooky. And with an absolutely brilliant environmental message: if you exhaust the natural resources, you're left in a wasteland. Now what is controversial about that?!Saw it in the cinema today in 3D - the 3D definitely helped amplify the kookiness and imaginative universe of Thneedville and the Lorax. The stuff that made me laugh the hardest was often non-verbal - the singing fish, the facial expressions on the bears. The defibrillator bear scene made me honk with laughter. I pity the poor bugger sitting near me!What seems to bug some other reviewers is that the green message is NOT subtle. Not at all. All the ""bad"" characters (apart from the Once-ler, eventually) are completely oblivious to the damage they are causing the forest and animals - or if they do notice, like O'Hare, they just don't care. But I kinda liked that. That is rather the point of this story. ""Unless someone like you cares an awful lot, things aren't going to get better. They're not.""

I found this ""movie""(if you can even call it that) an utter disgrace to Dr.Suess' name. I don't even know where to begin, first off, the animation was horrible and one of the best parts of the book was the artistry of the illustrations. Secondly, there was a love affair. No. This is Dr. Suess we are talking about, not ""The Notebook"". And the humor in this is horrible. It wasn't funny and I didn't appreciate it in a serious movie.

Nor did it do justice to Dr. Seuss and, yes, it was a bit to preachy in places. But let's remember, these films are made for children, and watching/listening to the children in the theatre yesterday, I'd say most of them were pretty happy.And why wouldn't they be? The singing fish were hilarious. The bear cubs were adorable. And some of the slapstick physical humour - which most young children love - was exceptionally well done. All in all, it delivered what it should for young children - a lot of fun.That's probably the distinction I'd make about this film. I, personally, love animations that entertain children and adults equally (like Shark Tale, Shrek, Tangled, Megamind, etc.). This isn't one of those.

161,craigedmond97,The Lorax,7,26 May 2013,"Before watching this film I was in the knowledge that there was voice- work done by both Zac Efron and Taylor Swift. So from this I gathered that the movie would be trying to make a connection with the young audience, not only through star power, but added stories that 'spice' up the tale. It is because of these added little ideas that the movie slumps.Overall, I enjoyed the movie, but I was left feeling it could have been better. I thought the story was beautifully told and it kept very true to the original, the main story that is. The added parts to the story prove to be uninteresting, such as the love affair between Audrey and Ted which, although kick-starts the story, just doesn't sit well. It feels as if the writers had to throw it in just to make the story more relate-able. Then it also interferes with the message because it turns out that Ted isn't interested in trees so much as he wants so desperately to have Audrey, who should be the real speaker for the trees. Adding a villain to the mix, I feel, was also a bad move as there isn't meant to be one. We are meant to see the Once-ler as a bit of a villain yet feel sorrow for him as we can relate to his corporate greed as he succumbs to peer-pressure. Throwing in O'Hare creates the impression that the movie is trying so hard to do everything. It wants to be a Romance/Drama/Action/Comedy, but falls flat on two of those genres. Onto a more positive slant however, because like I said, I enjoyed this movie. The animation was astonishing. Very vibrant but eerie when it needed to be, really grabbing the viewers attention. The comedy was done well too, I found myself laughing several times as the Once-ler talked with Ted, and on other occasions. The actual character of The Lorax was done brilliantly and full credit has to go to Danny DeVito who was the stand out star. When he is called to be humorous, you hear it in his voice, when he is called to show disappointment you hear it and this is one of the main reasons the message still gets through clearly. There is a great level of sadness created when all the trees are gone and the Once-ler realises what he has done as we see how broken The Lorax has become.The story ends in proper Seuss fashion as we realises that the environment is very important to humans and nature, corporate greed can lead to losing yourself within the mass amount of madness you created and most importantly, if you don't care enough to change the problems you see in today's society, nothing will change.So overall, a well presented film with a beautifully told story, minus the love affair and air producing business, and a strong and poignant message.",The Lorax
162,rkeinc,Absolutely Breathtaking in 3D...,10,1 January 2013,"As many before me, I looked at the reviews on IMDb and was not interested in the movie. I hold IMDb reviews and ratings with high regard. However, on this movie, the ratings/reviews aren't even close. It deserves a 10 out of 10 for every reason; storyline, production value; artistry; fun; beauty; cuteness; etc., etc. I know we all have opinions and that is the beauty of our choices. I'm very glad I saw this movie and would recommend it to anyone looking to have a great movie experience. As my title indicates, I recommend it in 3D if you have the ability, but I watched it in both 3D and 2D and it was marvelous. For those who had the audacity to give it a 1 star, I would like better reasons other than the ones given.

163,mayor77,Just atrocious,1,17 December 2019,"There are only three things I actually like in this movie.
1: Danny DeVito. It's Danny DeVito, need I go on?2: How Bad Can I Be. This song isn't the least bit subtle but I actually kind of like the way it sounds and I listen to it a fair bit.3: The Memes. The movie's songs are very repetitive in their lyrics so people online have edited them so that every time a character utters a certain word, something happens and it's entertaining.
The rest is just flat out terrible. The message isn't subtle and is bogged down by the awful story and the hypocritical marketing. The humor just feels like leftovers from Minions (I know it came out after the Lorax but the humor style is still very similar). The animation is mediocre at best. The designs aren't that bad, except for the Oncler who looks like an incel, but the colors are so in your face that it almost hurts. However, the movement of he characters is okay. Most of the music is just crappy 2010's pop music and the lyrics are unsubtle as hell. The acting is pretty bad. Zac Efron's voice doesn't fit a child and Taylor Swift isn't even an actor, and it really shows. Overall, it's just a boring, hypocritical mess of a film that I can't help but feel nauseous whenever I think about it.",The Lorax
164,YinYangReviews,Turned a 180° on The Original,5,20 January 2020,"If you compare the original and Illumination's Lorax, you may notice alot of difference. The original keeps the Once-ler's hidden because he can represent all of us while in here, they don't give a damn and just revealed his identity in the story of why there's no more trees, even at the end when he's old.
The animation may look good and colorful, but this is a Illumination movie we are talking about, there will be filler, old jokes, boring moments, and alot of annoying moments. Speaking of filler, there is a filler plot.
A kid wants to get a tree for Taylor Swift's character because she said that anyone who gives her a tree from The Lorax main plot she will marry. So basically the kid has a crush on her. Not relavent to Dr. Seuss at all. Speaking of representing us a bad people, there is a bad guy in this movie. Wasn't the entire point of the original Lorax was there is no bad guys?
Overall, this is one of those bad Illumination movie and bad ""Based on books"" movie. Any Illumination movie can be perfect for children and kids, but I would not recommend it if you are a true Dr. Seuss fan.",The Lorax
165,gdhiskes,Planting a Seed,8,21 September 2020,"The Lorax is a classic and it's definitely towards a younger audience, but this is a necessary message and one that relies on the younger and next generations to carry it out.

166,theantimonyelement,Sometimes change is a good thing...,8,4 April 2012,"...in this case, changes from the book/original TV short. A lot of people have been lamenting the ""frame story"" this movie adds in, as well as the idea of making the Once-ler a human character. As far as the frame goes, it's done pretty well. It's a bit flat but perfectly enjoyable for younger kids. Making the Once-ler human, though? BRILLIANT. Hear me out. The original Once-ler was a faceless force of destruction, a shadowy embodiment of greed. This Once-ler is just a stupid kid with a dream, a guy who wants to change the world. He's not evil, but he lets his success get to his head, and that brings about his own downfall and the destruction of the forest. That's FANTASTIC, and here's why: that's how the world really is! Companies don't sit around all day cackling about how much smog they're pumping into the atmosphere; it's a process, and something that happened gradually. Obliviousness is just as dangerous as maliciousness, and that's a really powerful lesson. This can happen to YOU if you're not careful; anybody can hurt the planet if they don't pay attention. That's a rare lesson, and one I'm really pleased to see in this movie. So, is it silly and stupid sometimes? Yes, of course. But it's colorful and exuberant, and in a lot of ways I think it really captured the ""Seuss-ness"" that similar remakes have missed. There's nothing offensive about it (besides the miserable marketing) and my little brother enjoyed it as a fun movie. I enjoyed it for giving us a deeper--and in my opinion, very powerful--character type: the accidental villain, the everydude who makes a horrible mistake that the environment suffers for. So take that as you will...but overall, I found myself liking this a lot more than I expected. Definitely worth a watch.",The Lorax
167,jamesbrown1973,So misses the point and changes the story too much,5,20 July 2012,"The songs were abysmal, the story was changed too much (It was barely recognisable). I loved the original story (used to scare me as a kid), but the full length 60s feature was fantastic with amazing songs - the songs in this were the worst in any film I've seen in a long time (worse than the updated Willy Wonka!!). Still not the worst film ever on its own merits - just a terrible adaptation.The voices didn't seem to work very well either -and they felt they needed to add in a romance and even - shock - show what the Onceler looked like - the whole menace and charm was that you never see him.

168,flamegamehunter,"All in all, it was adapted well, and I would watch it again.",8,18 March 2012,"The Lorax. I remembered the story vaguely before watching the movie, and I can say that it was not a disappointment. I was curious to see how it could have been integrated into an hour-and-a-half-long film, being one of the shorter Dr. Seuss books. It was done quite well. There was a musical number right in the beginning, and that caught me a bit off guard, but it wasn't too daunting of a curve-ball. Then the nice back-story of the main kid, Ted (Zac Efron), was developed with his family and friends, and Betty White is an awesome grandma who knows everything and can snowboard and such. The main villain is a short, but mean guy, Mr. O'Hare, who sells fresh air to the plastic, smog-filled town of Thneedville, the resultant of the deforestation that was the main story in the book. All of this is developed early around Ted's life and his attraction to Audrey (Taylor Swift) who just wants to get a tree that isn't plastic. So Ted leaves town to go find one because his grandma said to, and he has to bring (from the book) fifteen cents, a rust nail, and the shell of a great-great grandfather snail to The Once-Ler (Ed Helms (Stu from the Hangover)). This is where the movie plays into the first couple pages of the book, and it's nice to have that back-story so we can care about the kid from the book. Here, the Once-Ler's life becomes the next hour of the movie, and not in a bad way. It doesn't drag on, and the Lorax (Danny DeVito) gets introduced here. You see the Once-Ler deforest the land in greed and grime, and it follows the book well while still remaining interesting and kiddy. The singing fish became a bit annoying at times (most of the times in the Once-Ler's flashbacks) and they beat the fat bear joke till it coughed sand, but this didn't hamper the entire experience. Danny DeVito fit the Lorax quite well, and I found myself laughing a lot at what felt were the right times. So as to not spell out the entire movie, once Ted leaves the Once-Ler's abode, the movie has to stray from the book. It gets action-y and downright silly at these points, but it still stayed true to classic Dr. Seuss style. Happy ending etc with fun music, midget humor, and color explosions. I'd give it an 8 out of 10. The music seemed a bit forced at times, and the fish were quite annoying, but the movie was great. It adapted the book quite well and definitely kept my attention throughout the movie. I would absolutely watch it again.",The Lorax

It made me think about how kids are the future, we are the world and if we don't do anything, nothing will change. It will only grow worse. And this is why I think the movie sends the huge message. Not only was it funny, it made you think. And that's the whole point. Kids will make the future.. So know what you want to do and do it. Just like Ted. Be the person you want to be. Dr. Seuss may not be here now, but it doesn't mean we can't listen to what he's written. We can change the world.",The Lorax
170,official-filmbioskop,Saving Thneeds For Ecological Reminder,8,25 March 2012,"Dr. Seuss' stories are variety enough from short ones to the long ones. Most of them had been successfully adapted into feature movie with the highest grossing ever was How the Grinch Stole Christmas! back in 2000. Now 45 pages children books are being transcript-ed into screenplay by Ken Daurio and Cinco Paul into 86 minutes animation with more serious intention for the young adults.12 years old, Ted is trying to win Audrey's heart by digging stories about Lorax, orange creature with mustache who at once fight for ecosystem balance which been ruined by Once-Ler with his massive amount needs for Thneeds. Nowadays, Ted's good will is challenged by Mayor O. Hare who do not wants to change any single image of Thneedville inside the wall for whatever reasons.Basic plot is rather simple between Ted-Audrey. But the subplot is more than that, enduring and everlasting nature is perfectly spoken by its narrative beautifully graphic including old and new Thneedville designs with such contradicted. 3D is not necessary either because minimum ""popped-out"" image. Let the 2D itself enough to display its simplicity yet communicative scenery.The dialog between Ted and Once-Ler is very interestingly addictive. Efron did his best with curiosity tones, Devito with wise deep voices, appreciated emotional Ed Helms with regrets he had been made. Also the soft ""country"" sound from Swift is enough to endorse the different between characters.I believe this high-risk project is more suited for kids who will enjoy trio singing fish with choreography, also playful bear cubs running in the greeny woods. Adults will not find entertaining at its best especially when they find out what has been campaign directly through this movie, to plant a tree for better future in our very own earth.

I am not familiar with the Dr. Seuss characters at all, but I came out thinking that surely Dr. Seuss would have been disappointed with it. Movies should stand alone and be successful cinema by themselves, independent of whether the storyline comes from an original movie script or a widely-known source such as Dr. Seuss' books, and this one just doesn't cut it. The characters generally were not sufficiently developed, and it was difficult to connect with any of them. I saw the 2D version, and was unimpressed by both the animation and the action sequences, which 3D surely couldn't have saved. The abundance of color wasn't enough either to bring this picture to life, unlike ""Rio"". In general, it was soooo predictable, not even the music was memorable nor catchy enough. C'mon, guys, please just don't make movies for the hell of it. Tell us something we don't know, or at least in a way we don't know.

178,blackbird827,This isn't Dr. Seuss,1,24 June 2013,"This movie is...How can I even begin to explain...This isn't Dr. Seuss. At all. Now I understand how adaptations from books into films will be rearranged. Film is a different form of telling the story, and there are different factors that are implemented into the process. But, all in all, a film adaptation should mainly do its job- carrying the message and enjoyment of a book into cinematic form. Lord of the Rings was a great adaptation, as Percy Jackson was a terrible one. The Lorax, well...Just...no. Let's take a look at this shall we? The Lorax, written in 1971, was about a boy who is on the outskirts of town, listening to a mysterious creature-the Onceler, as he speaks of the Truffula extinction and environmental danger. ""At the far end of town where the Grickle-grass grows and the wind smells slow-and-sour when it blows and no birds ever sing excepting old crows... is the Street of the Lifted Lorax."" Well, you get the picture. The story progresses as the Onceler, a fabled figure and the labeled antagonist, tells the story of the invention of his multipurpose ""Thneed."" In search for the material to make his glorious invention, he finds the tufts of Truffula trees in a land where they are plentiful. On this land, the Barbaloots, Swomee Swans, and Humming Fish all lived prosperously. After cutting one down and knitting a Thneed, the Lorax appears, a short brownish creature who pops out of a stump. Agitated, the Lorax informs the Once-ler that he speaks for the trees and demands to know why he cut one down. When the Once-ler shows him the Thneed, the Lorax tells him nobody would want to buy one. However, soon after, a man comes by and purchases the Thneed. The Once- ler, ignoring the Lorax's pleas, calls his family down with a promise of riches. The Once-ler invents a ""Super-Axe-Hacker"" and says he doesn't see the Lorax until a few weeks later. On the Lorax's return, he states that the constant cutting down of the trees is the reason why he has to send away the Barbaloots, for the fruit they ate from the trees is decreasing and there isn't enough to go around, giving them ""crummies in tummies."" Despite this, the Once-ler insists that business is business. He then speaks of ""biggering"" his enterprise, which results in the Lorax visiting once more, telling him that the Swomee Swans can no longer sing because his enlarged factory produced too much smog. The Humming Fish are also leaving because the gunk in the pond makes it impossible for them to hum. At this point, the Once-ler is just really irritated with the Lorax and tells him to go away, he needed to do business. That is, until the last Truffula tree fell. The story basically ends with the Once-ler in an optimistic haze, telling the nameless child that if he won't make a difference, things will never change.How did that become what was released? In the 2012 release of The Lorax, the antagonist role, originally upheld by the faceless Once-ler, was taken by a greasy midget with a bob haircut and mindless minions who could probably lift a truck. The actual plot of the movie is animated Zac Efron on a quest to find a tree- not caring about the environmental benefits at all, but only to, well, acquire relationship status with animated Taylor Swift. Even when he goes to speak to the Once-ler, as the Once-ler begins to tell the story, animated Zefron is impatient. The content of the actual book is in a short sequence padded with annoying musical numbers and pointless subplots that diverge from the actual purpose of Dr. Suess WRITING the Lorax in the first place. We don't hear about WHY it's bad to cut down trees. We don't hear about why all the animals leave, they just do. The Once-ler is replaced by another monopolizing manipulative antagonistic man who makes money off of selling air. After Zefron acquires the remaining Truffula seed (he only got it for Taylor Swift kisses), he has a lengthy monologue in the town center after a pointless car race about how ""PAYING FOR AIR IS BAD."" Not about how ""POLLUTION AND AIR SMOG IS KILLING HUMANS."" But that corporations making you pay for things suck. This is not what the original intent of Dr. Seuss' novel was, period. There is no environmental implication whatsoever, and the movie spends approximately 30 minutes focusing on the content of what Ted Geisel wrote. What was meant to be a stand against pollution and a statement about environmental conditions, turns into a statement against corrupted corporations... Betty White. The only cool thing about this movie. Just saying...",The Lorax

Dr.Seuss's original story was short and in order to expand it into a feature film they had to add many things. And to the people that plan to see it but don't know the original story go read it. Or Google the original 30 min movie. It will help you gain insight into the story a little bit better. My only complaint about the movie is that they glossed over the names of the animals.

185,ehcysp,Average,6,3 March 2012,"When I saw the trailers to this movie, I was groaning. The book and original animated movie were both very good, and upon seeing this remake with the love plot, and the whimsical antics really put me off it. I thought I would see it anyway and hoped it would surprise me, like Up. I was pleasantly surprised (but my expectations were very low, so that wasn't hard). First off, the animation/design. The animation was very good, and the scenes indicated that it was made for 3d (which it was). The designs are very Dr. Seuss like, the birds and fish were very similar to the book, as were the trees (the fish looked similar to the one in the Cat in the Hat). The streets and roads were ridiculously wavy and loopy, so they were exactly like a Dr. Seuss creation. The Lorax was very similar to the book as well. Now lets look at what the movie does good and bad in terms of characters/plot. This is a remake/expansion, I didn't expect it to be accurate to the book entirely. The Plot is; a young boy wants to find a tree for a girl, so he leaves town to talk to the Oncler, the only person who's ever seen a tree (apparently). The Oncler tells of the time when trees were active, and the Lorax who protested to the Oncler's removal of them. With this knowledge, the boy seeks to restore the trees to the city despite a rich business man trying to stop him. This business man sells air. It's kept in bottles and cans, like water (Spaceballs reference?). He's just a generic, corporate bad guy, and not a very interesting one. The main complaint I have with this movie is the romantic subplot. It feels like this was created to rationalize caring for the trees (maybe I'm misreading), it seems unnecessary and annoying. Many of the Jokes fell flat for me (but that's a matter of personal preference). The movie should have been about the Oncler and the Lorax. I liked the direction the movie went with the relationship between the Lorax and Oncler, it was a tragic friendship which played out pretty well (I thought it should have been given the forefront instead of the made-for-this-movie romance plot). The relationship could have been done better with more interactions as the Oncler rises in wealth, but for what it is, it's pretty good. The Songs also annoyed me. They were kind of annoying and saccharine (with an added comment from the characters to sometimes point this out, as if to say ""look at this, its so cutesy but its okay because we've pointed this out""). the only song I enjoyed was:Spoiler The song where the Oncler grows in fame, wealth, and power. He justifies his actions with an excuse that many businessmen use (what am I doing wrong, its not illegal, no one's stopped me, so it must be okay). As the song goes on, the Oncler gets bigger, and more threatening, as more trees die and factories pop up. In the end the Lorax is left dejected. Spoiler endsThe Oncler was human in this movie, and the audience could see him clearly, but in the books his face and race were obscure (this can go either way, in terms of audience favor, but I didn't mind it).The Grandma was okay, she played too much into the lively whimsical old person archetype, and that was okay (her antics could be weird, and kind of annoying sometimes thought). I thought the voice work was okaySpoiler The environmental message was a pretty good one. Clear cut that saving trees is good, and people need them. The reason the boy goes was better in the original (being the only one who cared, and not because he wanted to impress a girl). The original also had the theme of Apathy, people stopped caring, so the forest died, and the Lorax just faded away. The Oncler regrets his actions and gives the last seed to the boy he told the story to. The remake continues on after that, showing the antics of the boy and his family and girlfriend as they outwit the generic corporate villain, and plant the tree, showing that the people were just in the dark, and willing to start a new. Personally, I liked the original ending, where the Oncler just gives the seed to the boy, and tells him to plant it. With that the Oncler just goes in doors, and the boy walks off with the seed. There was a sort of ambiguity, could the boy raise the trees again, and bring people to care again? Basically, it was up to the audience to decide whether the boy would succeed, and if we should try and save the trees. The movie shows that he does succeed, and that the people are just misinformed, not that they don't care (which trashes the apathy theme). I did like how End of spoiler, but..The ending in the movie was heartwarming, but I prefer the original, where it was depressing, but there was still some hope.The credits did have Dr. Seuss drawings, which was a nice touch (don't stay after the credits though, there is no other scene). I personally prefer the original movie, the themes were better, and the romantic plot tumor wasn't present. The animation is far superior, but this adaptation falls shy of the original. I personally say that a good environmental film is Princess Mononoke, and a bad one is Ferngully (Tim Curry was still cool though), neither should be a baseline comparison for any green messaged film. This film was okay, its not the original, it's its own film. I think that this film could have been much better, but it is what it is, and any Dr. Seuss fan should check it out.",The Lorax

As other reviews have mentioned, the biggest variance from the original story was that the once-ler was a character throughout the film.The movie was everything Dr Suess wanted the book to be, a simple story of a young boy in love, combined with a reminder that greed and devastation of wildlife will result in no more wildlife.It wasn't the most in-depth and complex movie I've seen, but it really isn't supposed to be.

187,rapidsail,seuss as environmentalist hypocrite,5,15 March 2012,"cinematically, the film is fine, no highs, no lows, kids enjoyed it, 5 stars. politically however, -10 stars: it is full of hypocrisy and a deep hatred for our civilization while using the very aspects of our civilization that Seuss decries to fashion the vehicle that displays his hatred. Seuss decries the loss of trees (like we cant grow more) yet his books were printed on, hmmmm, paper, and he lived in a, hmmmm, house made of wood, and used all of the science and technology available to him to present his stories in books and film. And we are all watching a film that utilizes a fantastically advanced technology that depends on such a vast history of human creativity and discovery(wow, seuss was one of those horrible ""creative"" humans too) in science, engineering, technology and ""gasp"" business with profits and, ugh, capitalism/free-markets (free? doesn't that mean people have to be free too? after all, it's ""people"" who do all this, right? And they all want to feed their kids too, right?) yet the deep attacks suggesting that all of this human creativity is somehow eeevvviiilll is just sickeningly, not only in completely ignoring the technology and free-markets that seuss utilized to further his own career, but the creativity of the vast millions of humans who came before us, thousands of years of living, sacrificing, fighting, dying, creating, and discovering the infinitely vast foundational knowledge that we build on today. That fellow humans would attack all of that and fail to acknowledge any of it makes me think they are profoundly evil and incredibly self-serving. Almost ""self-hating"" as it were. And seuss is part of an army of people who act and think in the same way. Fortunately for all of us living today and our posterity, we continue to prove wrong, the seusses among us.

198,ebbradsh,"Two Stories, One Vastly Superior",6,9 April 2014,"All reviewers of this movie seem to either love it or hate it, and it's easy to see why. As has been pointed out to death, the ""modernized"" Hollywood story added in of a celebrity-voiced kid trying to win a girl and overcome a two- dimensional villain in the process is thoroughly uninteresting, and will make older moviegoers angry at the lack of effort made in expanding the story. The Once-ler's tale, on the other hand, is the story carried over from the book, one of unchecked ambition and carelessness. The Once-ler is morally gray and this is done very well, as he is likable, yet you're never sure- is he a villain? A misguided hero? Somewhere in between? Sure, it's padded out with cutesy animals, but knowing what becomes of them in the end makes it considerably less innocent. This story is where Seuss's message is, and it still makes it through. The score by John Powell is epic and the animation and designs are gorgeous, which add great atmosphere in the darker parts of the movie. The environmental message is very un-subtle, and people who dislike that in other movies will dislike it here. One need only listen to the cut song ""Biggering"" to see how powerful this story could have gotten. And they just didn't have the guts. But beauty does manage to seep through in places, and this is one movie that I'd highly recommend seeing only parts of.",The Lorax
199,number_of_the_beat_666,How Bad Can (this film) Be? (Clue - not very),4,27 July 2012,"Now, I wasn't really interested in seeing this movie. The only reason I went to see this was cos my lady friend wanted to see it. Being the gentleman that I am, I agreed to go along with her. My expectations weren't exactly very high when I went to see this film, let me say, after leaving the cinema, these expectations were beaten.The titular character (Danny DeVito) was entertaining enough, he was good, but nothing special. The character of Ted (Zac Efron) was totally unnecessary and didn't add ANYTHING to the film. Every time he appeared on screen, I just wanted to fast-forward through it. Audrey (Taylor Swift) was the obligatory love interest...that was it. She did provide the worst line in existence though! ""It's called photosynthesis""! (Me and my friend were laughing really hard at that part).The best character though, The Once-ler (Ed Helms) is the reason why I consider this a good film. Seriously, The Once-ler just OOZED personality and was the only character that really appealed to me. I would seriously consider this film to others, if only to see how The Once-ler turns from a naive farm boy, into evil corporate sell-out.One thing though, if you plan to see this, make sure you know that it is a musical. When I went to see it, I was the only one (out of about 20 or so) to know that was a musical. And on topic of the music, there's one song which will stick in your head, hours after the film has finished (and that's a guarantee)! The ""humour"" in this film is...well...not that good. There were only a couple of times when I chuckled. I found the overemphasis of the grandmother (Betty White) too much (although my friend loved her) and the overuse of a certain overweight animal was just unfunny, all throughout the movie.Saying that though, overall I'm glad I saw this movie, if only to see The Once-ler. Seriously, I cannot say enough good things about this guy! My favourite parts of the movie: the song ""How Bad Can I Be?"" and the whole character of The Once-ler.",The Lorax

It gets to the point that the environment is in trouble, but it is possible to make a difference. Isn't that what people think is the biggest problem now days. This movie gets the message across without being preachy and people of all ages can understand it. Plus who doesn't like tiny cute forest animals? I don't understand why people are giving this movie such bad reviews. The music is catchy, the evil person is not scary, and the characters are funny. What more could you want out of a kids movie? I would like to mention that this is a kids movie, not a high action movie with hidden meanings for adults.

It felt like a movie made by someone with a completely different mindset from me, and I hated how they made you sit the through parts that were so predictable. Have to have ten lines to submit his comment so I disliked Betty white, Taylor Swift, the oncelers's family. It wasn't boring for me until his family came then I could have turned it off from there. So the lorax didn't have the power to stop the onceler just because. It certainly seemed like a huge part. Hated the townspeople, lots of white people.

The main message of this movie is that corporations are evil and you should trust everything with the government. I understand we shouldn't be chopping down trees and stuff like that, BUT THIS MOVIE HATES CAPITALISTS! It shows that if you stop working and become poor to save the environment, the government will pay for everything.

If they had just updated the 1972 version with animation improvements, this one would have had possibilities. The original (1972) screenplay was by Seuss (Geisel) himself and thus consistent with the spirit of the book. It had a more ominous ending that this year's version sought to improve on.Anytime you take a short story and try to make it a feature length, you run the risk of losing the charm of the original tale. The 2012 version had too many extraneous elements that just dragged out the story. One positive was the song at the end which gave a more hopeful tone.

They live in the town of Thneedville, where everything but the people is artificially made. Ted's Grandma Norma tells him to go out of town and seek the Once ler, the man who knows what happened to the trees. So the Once-ler tells Ted the story of the Lorax .

As someone who cares deeply, i love that this massage is transported to kids. It's important.

The first half-hour was a bit entertaining but then it just turned to be very boring, cheesy, sing-song kind of thing that leaves you anticipating the ending. I had high expectations considering that I actually enjoyed Horton Hears a Who!

Let's desecrate something beautiful to make a buck.,1,30 January 2015,"We have taken what was intended to be a beautifully somber, cautionary tale and turned it into a cheesy boy-meets-girl story where the audience is invited to empathize with the ""Onceler"" including bubble-gum pop musical numbers.Seuss's clear intention as only depicting the Onceler, and his family members as sets of hands, was to make the reader understand - we are all the Onceler, through our incessant need for things we don't need, that we feel that will somehow fill a void that can never be filled with things. The depiction of the Onceler as a full faced character, and giving faces to all the people who want to buy Thneeds allows the viewer to objectify the characters, and distance themselves from their role in the fable. Shifting the role of protagonist from the Oncler to the boy, robs the reader of the Onceler as the tragic focal point of the story. Finally, instead of wanting the trees back for the sake of the beauty of nature, and the pain at its loss, the protagonist seeks to get a tree to win the love of the girl he admires. This movie only diminishes the timeless lesson Seuss conveys via his children's book.

I hate politically-driven movies, Wall-E and Happy Feet included. At least Wall-E had the decency to wait until the very end to poop on the parade. The Lorax sits on your face and won't stop farting for an hour and a half. I left feeling dirty and angry and abused.Here's a summary of the movie that will save everyone an hour and 29 minutes: Hug a tree. The End.Now, will whoever is responsible for turning all of Dr. Seuss' books into really crappy movies kindly STOP!?!?!?!",The Lorax
220,shelbyweiss-87500,"Overall, I thought it was an adorable movie and highly amusing!",10,11 December 2019,"The Lorax opens up talking about a town called Thneedville. Everything there is plastic and fake, but the people of the town love it. There are no real trees, so the citizens must buy O'Hare Air to breathe clean air. One kid went swimming and ended up glowing due to all the chemicals in the water. Families can buy different models of fake trees, which I feel is equivalent to the people of today buying new cars. One kid, Ted, decides to find a real tree for a girl that he likes. This leads him to the Once-ler, who tells him the story of what happened to the trees.
The movie revolves around a challenge that the whole world faces, which is the environment and our effect on it. The Once-ler cuts down a Truffula to build a thneed, so he can make money. After the first tree is cut, the Lorax, who speaks for the trees, comes to tell him that cutting down trees can have a huge negative outcome. The Once-ler does not believe this and is too obsessed with making money that he cuts down every tree is existence. The once beautiful forest is now destroyed, and all the animals are forced out of their homes to find a safer place to live.
Mr. O'Hare created O'Hare Air, put the air in plastic bottles, and built the bottles in factories to produce more smog so people would have to buy his air. It all revolves around wealth. Just like Thneedville, the world today is more focused on money than their quality of life. People are wanting fancier cars, bigger houses, and more technological advancements. All of these require a large amount of resources that are not necessary for us to have and negatively affect the environment.
The Lorax shows how important a simple tree is to live a truly happy life. We are surrounded by nature and if we take that away in exchange for fancy gadgets of the future, we lose a critical component in our lives. The Lorax sees a thneed that the Once-ler had produced and stated that he ""chopped down one of my trees to make this piece of garbage,"" which represents how we destroy nature's beauty to show our material wealth that has no true benefit for us in the long-run. If the environment was untouched by mankind, the environmental challenges we face today would not exist. Nature is capable of taking care of itself and have a positive effect on our quality of life, while factories will fail eventually and have a negative ripple effect around the world.
Ted goes on a mission to plant a Truffula tree inside Thneedville to expose the creator of O'Hare Air for taking advantage of the people for not having trees. After convincing all the citizens of Thneedville that trees are important, Ted plants the tree right in the middle of town. Time goes by and Truffula trees are growing all around. In my opinion, this movie is for anybody of any age. It addresses the serious issue we have today of greed and little concern for the environment, and what could become a potential problem in our future, but the movie is highly amusing and sends a good message.
Global challenges cannot be solved if one focuses on the whole planet and every challenge there is. One must start in a specific location and choose one challenge to take their first step towards making a difference in the world. For the future, we must start small to help the environment around us. We can recycle, reduce the amount of plastic we use, and begin using renewable energy. If everybody changed one thing in their household or life to help the environment, it could make a huge difference in the world we live in right now. As Dr. Seuss said, ""unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot, nothing is going to get better. It's not.""",The Lorax

I also understood before I watched this movie that a book that takes a few minutes to read is going to require some filler to become a feature film. That said, The Lorax is, in my mind, one of the greatest books of all time, and a book that helped my shape my outlook on ecology since I read/studied it in grade 6 back in ol' 1990. Here's the reason why The Lorax is a horrible movie: it took a great book about ecology and made it into a limp love story. The kid doesn't save the truffula trees for the good of the world, he does it to impress a chick. The entire premise of this movie was flawed from the very beginning, and it never got better. There's very little to laugh at, and the morals that the good Dr. instilled within his brilliant book are left as a forgettable subplot. You're better off sticking with the 1970s cartoon if you need to watch a Lorax movie. Everything about it is better than this filth.",The Lorax
232,hack_n_slice,"Not a masterpiece, but decent enough.",4,23 March 2012,"So this bizarre Once-ler obsession has been taking my home website of deviantART by storm, and finally I was thrust into watching ""The Lorax,"" despite my strong personal objection. As the son of an environmental sciences professor, I have many strong feelings about Dr. Suess' The Lorax, having grown up with the original book and animation from oh so long ago. I have to admit, it is a cute, decent movie; nothing as terrible as I thought it was going to turn out. That said, it's no masterpiece, either.Plot: The plot was true enough to the story, with a few minor changes. Instead of focusing on the story of the Once-ler and his rise to power and ultimately failure, the new Lorax movie features the young boy as the primary. Or does it? This left me a little confused, as the fight for character dominance continues throughout the story, focusing partly on Ted (the boy) and partly on the Once-ler. I don't have a problem with duel leads, but in this case I felt as though it added nothing to the story, instead taking away from both characters chances to shine as the star. I did not understand the importance of O'Hare and his posse, or their attempts to foil Ted's exploits, but it seemed as though it must have been relevant. The Once-ler's story kept getting chopped into pieces (just like those poor truffula trees), to tell it.Characters: The characters in this movie are varied. Some, like the Once-ler and the Lorax (you would hope) were vivid, lively, and well-written. Others, I couldn't help but wonder what they were doing in the movie. I failed to see Audrey's role in the story, aside from providing a romance interest, and O'Hare and his lackeys did nothing but try to create problematic situations for young Ted, despite no true reason to do so. Obviously the star of the movie was the Once-ler, and I will admit, I was taken with his character. The ""evil"" outfit was perfect The use of colour, fantastic. They used the Once-ler's signature green gloves and the connotation of green as representative of greed, and black as lingering darkness to paint an awesome character. I can now see why he is so well-liked. That said, I found myself disliking the sympathetic portrait they painted of him, throughout. Not because I am against sympathetic characters, but because it goes against the original idea of the Once-ler. In the original, the Once-ler is a greedy man who doesn't see the error of his ways until it is much too late. He considers the notion a few times, but there is ultimately no guilt. In this, he is well aware of the harm he's creating and the promise he made—and broke—to the Lorax. In short, wonderful character, but perhaps the wrong place for him. The Lorax himself was well-portrayed, however, and seemed to stay true to Dr' Suess' original idea.Graphics/Sound: Good animation, but that should be expected in major animated motion pictures, these days. I will admit I didn't care for the style, though. Perhaps it is me speaking as a traditional animator, but I feel as though the entire movie would be a lot more powerful if it was hand-drawn, and not 3D computer graphics. The extremely tooney style and over-expression of characters makes me think it would have looked amazing, in 2D. The sound was good; particularly the voices. I have never been a big fan of DeVito, but he made for a very good Lorax. The music, however, left a lot to be desired. While I admit there was a catchiness to ""How Bad Can I Be?"" the Once-ler's song of self-justification, most of the musical numbers are extremely average.Message: While the message here is obviously the preservation of nature and protection of the environment, I wasn't sure I was completely swayed. As the child of a strong and accomplished environmentalist (and as a budding environmentalist myself), I have seen many, many movies with many, many environmental messages, and this one just didn't do it for me. In fact, at the end, O'Hare even gives a pretty damn good argument against. Had I been a resident of the town of Thneedsville, I might have stayed on his side, particularly since the town is all light and bright and beautiful, without a single plant. I mean, ants and bees? Who needs that? Without a solid argument promoting the importance of nature and human connection to the environment, I fail to see how everybody could suddenly burst into song.Conclusion: Meh. It was nothing special, and certainly didn't provide the powerful message that the original book and animation did. With the exception of a few humorous one-liners and visual antics, it was very forgetful. I applaud the developers for a rare environmental movie, but even this ended up being a let-down after hearing about and watching the notorious car add. What is the point of promoting important causes, if you are simply going to follow the hypocritical path of selling out, and you become a Once-ler, yourself? While I won't relate this action to the movie itself, it does say an awful lot about the people we put our faith in, in the entertainment industry. In short? Practice what you preach, in your mainstream B-grade family entertainment.",The Lorax
233,TheMinion9,Good but not as Good as I expected....,6,31 July 2012,"Before I begin, this is my first review in ages. So, here goes nothing!I went to see it yesterday in my local cinema and I thought that this film would be good (With the ad's saying ""From the makers of Despicable Me"", I knew this won't be bad!) and I held my head high when I went in to see but when I went out, My head was neither held high or low.The Plot in short: In the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of his dream girl, Audrey. When he learns of her wish to see a real tree, Ted seeks out the Once-ler, a ruined old businessman outside of town in a stark wasteland. Upon hearing of how the hermit gave into his greed for profits and devastated the land over the protests of the Lorax, Ted is inspired to undo the disaster. However, the greedy Mayor of Thneed-Ville, Aloysius O'Hare, has made his fortune exploiting the environmental collapse and is determined to stop the boy from undermining his business.I'll start with the good things before I go onto the cons. I really enjoyed the songs. How bad can I be and Let it grow (Celebrate the world) were the best songs but the other were average (Illumination, well done with the songs. I expect more songs from your future films guys!). The Lorax and Once-ler plot was the best part of the movie (Really!). The voice actors for the two NAILED the parts really well. The only characters I liked from Ted's story (more on that later) were the Grandma and Audrey. I have to admit, the voice actors made their parts better than other voice actors would of in them roles. The ending was quite emotional (SPOLIERS: Just seeing Once-ler and Lorax be reunited once again was one of the best parts. END OF SPOILERS).Now the bad things (OH NO!), The main plot (Ted and the seed thing) didn't hold up very well along with Once-ler's story and was kind of annoying. Continuing with that, O'hare ISN'T really a villain. I'm going to go into SPOILER space now so if you don't want to be spoiled, skip the next couple of lines. If there's a character I dislike the most because of his/her actions, it's Once-ler's mother. I disliked her so much cause of the way she sent Once-ler to chop down the trees (He does anyway and braked Lorax's promise)! If Illumination deleted her character (or made her part smaller), they could of built the rise of Once-ler falling into greed a way load longer (Making the film longer which equals BETTER REVIEWS than this!!). END OF SPOILERSSummary: I went in to see this with High hopes but was impressed but not too impressed. If you want to see a film from Illumination after Despicable Me, just wait till Despicable Me 2 (and the upcoming Minion Spin-off which I'm dying to see cause the Minions were the best characters)! Lorax is sub-par and the same for Hop. Lorax had good ideas (Like the Musical aspect which was well done and the sub-plot) let down with a weak main plot line, an not-evil villain and bland characters (expect Audrey, The Grandma, Once-ler and Lorax). I will be seeing Despicable Me 2 and The Minions Spin-off though. Illumination, I expect better that this for a company that NEARLY beat Pixar with their first film!",The Lorax
234,insomniac_butterfly730,"Good lessons, too political for young children",5,15 March 2012,"My 3-year-old son and I saw this movie in the theater. It was quite entertaining and funny, although I have to say that there was a tad too many political overtones for a child to be exposed to.The movie is all about the importance of nature and planting trees - a lesson I FULLY agree with and support. However, there is a lengthy song-and-dance routine that paints a horrifying picture of greed and evil. While I believe it is important for children to learn these concepts early in life, I don't think they were very well-placed in this film at all. It could have been more subtle without taking anything away from the plot or film as a whole.Again, let me stress that I do not disagree with the positive message of the film, but rather the way the filmmakers chose to portray our country's politically liberal population as better and more compassionate than the contrasting conservative, right-wing population. This is a topic that is not meant for young children and it has no place in a film like this. These concepts are better debated and understood at a later age.",The Lorax

I don't believe corporations are evil and I don't think anything like what happened in the Lorax will happen on earth in that extreme. However a river did turn red in china this week and they don't know why...But I do live about 3 miles down a road that has a serious litter problem. We recently spent a Saturday as a neighborhood cleaning the road. It was horrible.Consumerism is not evil. But there are lot of evil consumers. And no matter how offended you are by this movie, your children could become one of those evil consumers. The number of people who throw trash out of windows is crazy.I would also mention that that three mile long road is undeveloped because its next to a retired landfill that cannot be built on for years. Some schmuck though it would be a great idea to build that landfill right in the middle of an area that would be a heavily populated middle to upper middle class neighborhood within 20 years. It's a beautiful road minus the litter. But our neighborhood is literally separated from the world by a retired landfill.My father also owns a business in an older industrial side of town. He rents a lot next to his business for pennies on the dollar because it was once a junk yard.

It was nice to see the Once-Ler as human; it showed him as just a normal person who made bad decision, and not just a faceless monster who hated trees. The boy motivation in the beginning might had be selfish, but he soon wanted the seed not for the girl but because the world needed the trees. The spirit of Dr. Seuss was in this movie. The art, even in 3-D, stay true to the Dr's. Even his message was there. Many fail to remember that the original children's book, and 30 min animated short was just that. In order to make the 89min film, extras needed to be added. Which they were able to do very well.Overall, don't believe the reviews that people have posted about 'The Lorax'. People were looking for something bad in the movie since it was announce they were making it. When they couldn't find anything they made some up.

In this case, a multi-million dollar buck. However, all they accomplished was what seems like a failed attempt at combining Elmos World with political debates. Why, you may ask? It is a bit politically biased, in the sense that the main characters are fighting to save the trees, which is a political approach. In fact, this could be an attempt to infuse the young with that message, when you think about that. Even though that was a bit ridiculous, the fact that this movie is raking in millions of undeserved dollars, is what is truly insane. There are, however a few factors that keep this movie from completely crashing and burning. One, the animation was nice, the voice actors great, and it just looked really nice. Young kids might get a kick out of the silly parts in this movie, but the plot will not mean anything to them other then '""Lets trees grow"". The worst part would have to be that terrible soundtrack. It...was...THE WORST COMPILATION OF SOUNDS EVER CREATED ON THIS PLANET! Truly the definition of corny and annoying.

245,charitydugood,11 Year Old and I (Dr. Seuss Fans) Loved It,9,10 April 2012,"I can't believe (well, yes I can) that people gave this a bad review. I was afraid I was going to be disappointed when I saw the Lorax, based on some reviews, but I wasn't at all. My 11 year old and I both loved the movie, she laughed out loud at many parts (although I have to admit she does do that a lot watching movies) and we left very pleased that we saw it.Background: I grew up on Dr. Seuss, my six kids grew up with Dr. Seuss. We love Dr. Seuss even as adults. We've read the book, we've seen the original movie. I have two vegetarian older daughters, we are environmentally conscious. Also, we like musicals and my father was a music teacher - so finding out it was a musical was not a disappointment. There was definitely NOT a lot of musical numbers. If you hate musicals, I think the songs are infrequent enough that you can groan through it and let your kid enjoy the movie. That said, despite all the reviews on bad music, we thought the songs were lively and fun and cute. You're not gonna go out and buy a record for it, but it fit the movie for the kids it was targeted to.Like another reviewer said: THIS IS A MOVIE FOR KIDS!! As with any movie, it's geared toward a certain age group. People who take two-year olds to the theater must be crazy, taking them to see this movie is no exception. Granted, there's cute fuzzy bears, but there's a story being told and a lesson - definitely geared toward elementary/pre-teens, not the yo gabba gabba crowd. Your toddler or active pre-schooler will not sit through this.My opinion is also based on the fact that we do not watch a lot of movies or TV, (I'm a firm believer that kids should be outside playing), and we are certainly not film or animation connoisseurs. I can see how someone used to intense-graphics and action-packed films would get bored with this. It is a story. If you like kid stories, you will like this. We did not find it boring, I thought it was well told, and it held our interest all the way through.Is it like the original? There's a lot different, a little similar. I don't think I've ever seen a movie that was like the book. Book is always better. Contrary to what another reviewer said about no rhyming, there are rhymes and some book quotes in the movie.When they redid Cat in the Hat, I didn't like it, didn't like what they did with the Cat character at all, but my kids did. I liked The Lorax, and my daughter did. (The others are in college and haven't seen it yet...but they will I'm sure.) I'm somewhat sensitive to violence and scariness in movies (but not overly so), and I feel this is safe to take your kids to if they get scared easy. There's occasional moments when I had to roll my eyes up and think ""did X really have to punch X at that moment"" - but it's not violent or scary at all. Your kid won't go home with nightmares or shooting people. Maybe they'll even plant a tree.If you have elementary/pre-teen kids I highly recommend this movie for you and your kids.",The Lorax
246,WorrisomeRain,This movie seems to have hit a few nerves,8,20 April 2012,"In a country where the majority of the citizens believe that global warming and evolution are myths, I really can't expect many people to welcome this movie with open arms. It's unfortunate, because there is a lot we can learn from it. Dr. Seuss was a revolutionary. He picked up on the harm corporate greed is causing this planet decades ago. Sadly, we haven't progressed very far since the first Lorax movie came out, of which I am a big fan by the way. Although the remake is a bit hokey, it sends a powerful message. Perhaps when the very last truffula tree falls, humans will realize what we have done but by then it will be too late.",The Lorax
247,jamesdrew19,Another Missed Opportunity and Awful Remake,1,21 July 2012,"Not that anyone is surprised, but this is just another remake, as Hollywood and the world seem to be in a dramatic shortage of creative thinking, imagination, and originality. The graphics are pretty good, with the animals and the trees stealing the show. Rob Riggle has the best dialogue by far, with Betty White coming in second. That's right- their two ancillary characters are better-written than the Lorax himself. All other characters fall unremarkably flat except the undeniably adorable animals, which shine brighter than the majority of the cast without ever uttering a word other than in musical sections. This movie is of course a remake (or ""reimagining"" as producers and directors are so keen on calling schlock which is clearly a teardown ripoff of original material) of the 70s original based on the Dr. Seuss book. The message of the originals is an imperative one, that we need to treat our environment better than me do. In our own greed-driven and selfish quests for wealth, we tear down and kill everything in our way, choosing the easy route rather than having to make any kind of difficult decision- no matter who or what it hurts. I believe that Dr. Seuss meant his writing to make children care about the world around them so that we could have a better tomorrow, with less pollution and less carelessness. Unfortunately, this message is mostly lost in the 2012 version. Hollywood has, as per its usual lately, unzipped and dropped trow on Seuss's message. No longer is it a story of a boy who actually cares enough to ask why the world around him is deteriorating. No, now the boy (who has become at least 12 or 13 by the looks of it) is not really concerned at all, but only trying to find a tree so that he can get some action from the ""hippie/activist girl"" stereotype added into the movie. Neither of those characters are very compelling. The book was filled with dark and gloomy colors meant to show you the destruction caused by greedy consumerism and lack of concern about improving the environment. This movie downplays that, limiting the appearance of the wasteland outside of the newly-invented Thneedville to just a few scenes and opting to more frequently show flashbacks and the suburban world inside ""the wall.""As for the dialogue and music? This is a Dr. Seuss book, yet most of the dialogue doesn't even bother being clever enough to rhyme. (And by most, I mean virtually ALL but the music.) And speaking of the music- dear, sweet, unmerciful god- listening to the atrocities people call music in this music was like watching a snuff film but with my ears. I felt unclean after listening to them. 'How bad can they be?' SPOILER ALERT: PRETTY FREAKING BAD. On a press release, Universal said that this was so successful that they were going to make another Dr. Seuss book into a movie.... 'The Cat in the Hat.' First of all...... Hasn't that already been done in 2003 with Michael Myers??????? GO Hollywood! Way to remake a remake of a remake of a book. I can't wait for the 2015 of the remake of that remake. You know what they say in Hollywood: The fourteenth time's the charm. Secondly: PLEASE DON'T! You are just going to ruin another childhood memory of mine and many other like-minded people whose parents actually had the care to make them read as a child instead of sitting them in front of the TV.Parents, please. Show your children the classics. By buying crap to set your children down in front of the TV for an hour to get rid of them for, you are breeding a generation of uneducated sheep who have awful taste in music and treat the world even worse than every generation before it. Seriously, let them watch a dramatic 10 minute reading of the original on Youtube. They'll learn more than the hour and a half waste of time that this movie is.And in closing, to the other reviewer promoting the ""Lorax Snuggie"" saying how awesome it is? My point is illustrated by your post. That looks an awful lot like a Thneed to me.",The Lorax

Not only is it totally boring, it also attempts to brainwash children with its overtly socialist themes such as ""business=greed"" and ""businessmen=evil"", and finally ""business = destruction of nature"". Blah blah blah! Give me a break! I am tired of these lefty productions. Not only are they a total waste of our time, money and energy, they also serve to brainwash yet another generation of Americans into thinking socialism is an everyday American value.

249,ashmenm-448-184052,The Lorax was surprisingly awesome.,9,13 August 2012,"I was so happy with this movie, I knew I had to see it but I was hesitant. As most reviewers have said this is one of Dr. Suess's best books and how can that possibly translate properly to a movie. Well as hesitant as I was to watch The Lorax I was curious. I watched this with my 2 1/2 year- old daughter and I loved it and what's more my daughter loved it which is more important than what I think of it anyway. Everyday since we got this on DVD my daughter pulls it off the shelf and says ""mommy let's watch the Lorax."" But as most parents know already your kids have their favorites and my daughter won't sit through movies that she doesn't like, this seems to become one of those favorites. To also make it clear my daughter is familiar with the book as well she has me read it almost every night. Both book and movie drive the same message across in slightly different but effective ways. I loved this and thought it was an excellent artistic interpretation of the wonderfully written Lorax by Dr. Suess. I only hope that after all the books turned to movies recently people can start to understand that the book and movie are separate, but this never seems to be understood.There will always be discrepancies between book and movie. The main thing is that this movie is wonderful despite the differences.",The Lorax
250,graceful-ali-grace,My new favorite movie :D,10,14 August 2012,"Coming from the perspective of a 13 year old girl, I absolutely adored this movie, and I bought it the day it came out (I even pestered my parents to take me to Wal-mart; and I hate bothering them for stuff they don't care about!). I went to see this with my 15 year old brother, his boyfriend, one of my friends, and my 6 year old sister- we ALL ended up loving it. My brother and I even went back to see it again the next day, haha! We didn't notice any controversy or sexism in it, aside from when O'Hare said d*** in the elevator, but my little sister didn't even notice (Note- this might be because my family has let it slip around her several times, but my point is that it was easy to miss.) I think it's great for all ages, and I am in fact, watching it as I type this. It is totally worth the money :D",The Lorax
251,ahoosier,Good,9,14 August 2012,"Certain quotes from the original needed to be added. But also people went on to say this movie is propaganda and what not, its funny because the original movie/book, had no humor in it what so ever. If anything this movie did a favor and lightened things up from the original movie/book. I like the original as I like this one too, but I'm making a point. The movie points out we can all get lost in something we are passionate about and hurt other because of it, even though we feel what we are doing comes naturally and is helping people, and the people that don't make that realization lose in the end. I find that an okay moral to teach a kid. How ba-a-aad can I be? I'm just bigger-in the economy. Getting lost in something you care about and hurting other incidentally, but realizing what you did and then try to fix it, is something everyone should do. Unless, unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot, nothing is going to change it's not. Point is the original was fine for kids to watch and this one is fine for kids to watch and its funny and makes some points about life and things, great movie.",The Lorax
252,frankman777,"Finally, an animation I can watch more than once!",9,18 August 2012,"I'm a little dumbstruck as to why the ratings for ""The Lorax"" are so low. I usually decide on which movies to watch based on their IMDb ratings, and so unfortunately only got around to watching it a couple of days ago. In a number of reviews I had read previously, there were smacks of political overtones, blah, blah, blah. Are you serious?! Take the movies at face value and enjoy it! The songs were brilliant, the plot was fast-moving and didn't allow for a dull moment. I watched it with my 4-year-old daughter, and she has an eye for good movies. She watched ""The Lorax"" for the 5th time yesterday. I like bloody TV series like Dexter, the overly sarcastic ""Doctor House"" and the sexually explicit ""Game of Thrones""... and I absolutely love(d) ""The Lorax"". Give me more of the same. It was freaking funny, entertaining and endearing all in one.Put aside your preconceived socio political notions and what you think the movie should be about... and watch it for its entertainment value.

This movie gave me the feeling the makers thought this was a sure thing. Just goes to show that nothing is certain. Terrible writing. Lame humor. Borrowed jokes. Borrowed characters. Insultingly stupid premises even for a cartoon. Lame family representations. No dads evident in the movie - just matriarchs. The bad guys are rednecks which seemed part hillbilly and part mafia. The other bad guys were über-evil businesses that want to pollute so they can sell air. Really? You call that writing? Don't you have to show some intelligence to write in Hollywood? Obviously not. The original Lorax didn't need a childish resolution or silly, lame, cliché humor. It was sad and a little poignant and made you want to protect nature. This movie made me want to chop down a tree - or a tall dandelion with a red tuft on it.",The Lorax
254,kevin10019,A fantastic film with a great message,10,19 May 2013,This is a film not just for kids (but ours loved it). There is a great message for us all about how corporate greed is hurting us all and our planet. It would be funny if it weren't so true. Definitely some amazing filmmaking wrapped in a colorful and highly entertaining movie. The animation is really well done and the timing of the movie ensures that you will be entertained throughout. We have a seven and a nine year old and they both loved the film which prompted a family discussion about the evils about greedy corporations and the mistruths they spew onto an all to apathetic public. The film stays true to the Dr. Seuss legacy and reminds me why they have always been a favorite of mine from childhood until today. Do yourself a favor and watch it with your children!,The Lorax
255,dhargate,"""Let It Grow""",10,17 October 2012,"Enclosed in the artificial town of Thneed-ville there lived a young twelve year-old boy, Ted (Zac Efron). Thneed-Ville is a 100% synthetic town. The air is sold as a product and nature is nowhere to be found. Thneed-ville swiftly changes because of Ted's sweetheart, Audrey (Taylor Swift). Audrey's biggest wish is to see a real tree, and Ted stops at nothing to make this happen. Visiting the Once-ler, he tells Ted the story of when he had become addicted to cutting down trees for money. All while ignoring the words of the guardian of the forest, ""the Lorax"". Ted becomes not only involved in finding Aubrey a tree, but decides to take a stand and speak for the trees. The children's book ""The Lorax"" originally written by Dr. Seuss has masterly been transformed into a motion picture. The lively colors and odd shaped objects create the vibe that Dr. Seuss is known for, but don't let the colors distract from its true meaning. ""The Lorax"" is a movie about saving the trees and being kind to nature. The theme man vs. nature is powerfully projected towards the viewers. The goal is to educate all ages about taking care of the world we have. The film makers didn't stop at just making this movie. Many foundations were formed to help prevent the loss of our world's trees. Hearing the name Dr. Seuss we automatically think of odd words that rhyme, bizarre shapes, and colors we never thought existed; therefore when creating this movie the animators had a huge palate to work with. Since Thneed-Ville was a manufactured city, the buildings and cars are futuristic and captivating. From the city to the forest, no words can describe the striking sight of the trees. Do your part in saving the tress and watch this highly recommend film, ""The Lorax"".",The Lorax
256,JosephineLopez,This movie is amazing :),9,8 November 2012,"""The Lorax"" is an amazing and adorable family movie that everyone should see! Many people have said that this movie is juvenile, stupid, and utterly disgusting but personally I loved it! I'm 13, and I still thought the animation was adorable, the moral was inspiring, and it even has one of my favorite singers! ""The Lorax"" is about a little 12 year old boy that lives in a town made of plastic. There is no life, no trees, no green! There is a girl that lives in his neighborhood that he likes very much. She hates the town of plastic and she longs to have one tree; one piece of life. The little boy goes on a scary adventure outside of the town to try and retrieve one tree for the girl he likes. To find the tree, he discovers the story of The Lorax, who is the protector of all of the living trees. This movie inspired me to take care of nature and to never give up. It was amazing!""The Lorax"" has charming and amazing animation. The little boy Ted has brown hair and brown eyes. Ted is played by Zac Efron. The girl that Ted is in love with is named Audrey. She has long golden hair and green eyes. She is played by the amazing Taylor Swift! Danny DeVito plays the adorable Lorax! The Lorax is a little orange fur ball that guards the trees! Teds grandmother is played by Betty White. She is a small old lady with white hair. She plays an important role because she is the one that tell Ted where to find the tree! The last character is Mr.O'Hare. Mr.O'Hare is played by Rob Riggle. He plays the mean mayor of the plastic town and he does not want anyone to have life or anyone to find life! So he try's to stop Ted from finding a tree an bringing it back to Audrey. Even though this movie was adorable, inspiring, and amazing, it is a little juvenile. Some people don't like animation in movies and maybe that's why it got a terrible rating. Also, I thought that the actors could have did better. Zac Efron for example, could have been more enthusiastic is his role. Taylor Swift plays Audrey in the movie. Taylor is an OK actress but I think she should stick to singing. I love her but I don't think acting is her thing. However, the overall movie was amazing. ""The Lorax"" is a movie that everyone should see!There is not many bad things about this movie, but there is many good things. This movie is truly inspiring. It teaches you to never give up no matter what the circumstance is, and it also teaches you to never hurt nature and all living things. It teaches you to never give up, when Ted rides out of the plastic town many times to finish hearing the story if the Lorax, and he almost gets caught. He never gives up on trying to get a tree for Audrey. This movie also teaches you to never hurt nature. When the Lorax tells the story of how the trees disappeared, it makes you realize how sensitive and beautiful nature actually is.Ultimately, ""The Lorax"" is one of my favorite movies. I saw it with one of my best friends and we thought is was cute, funny, and inspiring. Everyone should see this movie no matter what age you are. I think this movie will teach kids many things about killing nature and never giving up on your dreams. I hope that the people that do not like this movie will change their minds because this movie is truly amazing.",The Lorax

This movie is as biased and two-dimensional as my high school art teacher. The writers decided to lay blame for environmental ruin solely on the doorstep of innovators and entrepreneurs while saying absolutely nothing in regards to the willfully ignorant consumers of their products. Children's movies have gone downhill quite a bit since the days of The Secret of Nimh.On the positive side, the non-human characters are cute.

258,alexis-huffman,Unless,10,27 September 2013,"Dr.Seuss once said, ""Unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot, nothing is going to get better. It's not."" This powerful quote comes one of my favorite animations, ""The Lorax"". The popular children's book was written in 1971. It came to the big screen in 2012 from the directors Kyle Balda and Chris Renaud. They are also the creators who directed ""Despicable Me"". Making around $70.2 million opening weekend, this colorful entertaining film that teaches a very important lesson.The story took place in a town called ""Thneed-ville,"" which was a walled city, where everything was completely artificial, and the people even bought plastic containers of clean air. A young boy named Ted Wiggins (Zac Efron) fell for Audrey (Taylor Swift), whose dream was to see a real tree. After finding out where he could find one from his grandmother (Betty White), he bravely set out of town to try and grant Audrey's wish. Ted found the Once-ler (Ed Helms) outside of the city and listened to his story. The Once-ler was the reason why there were no more living trees. The Once-ler explained that when he cut down all the trees, he crossed paths with the Lorax (Danny DeVito), who didn't like human intruders. When Ted finally got along with the Once-ler after multiple visits, the Once-ler gave Ted a tree seed to take back to the city. Ted successfully took the seed back to the city and planted it, and he won Audrey by granting her wish.I believe that the directors, Kyle Balda and Chris Renaud, intended this film to be an environmentalist approach for children. Even though children are still young, they should still learn to care about the environment. This film shows the effects of environmental issues that we face every day in life. It teaches a lesson about why chopping trees down can be bad and how it can impact the world. At a young age, children don't realize what effect human have on the environment we live in. This film also makes it clear that if someone cares a lot about something, only good can happen out of it. Only good things will happen if someone decides to stand up and do what's right. This is one of my favorite animations by far. The bright bold colors make me feel happy. Being an animal lover, I also like how the animals give a cute and cuddly expression. The musical scenes make me want to join in and sing along because they are so catchy. I really hope that Universal Studios distributes more movies like this in the future. This movie was excellent overall, and I look forward to seeing more eye- catching films similar to ""The Lorax"".",The Lorax

The short story included in the cartoon now forms up a center of the new animation.Some people liked the cartoon more, personally I think this new breath made it good. It stopped to be just a teaching experience, maybe even a bit pretentious. Now we're involved in the action and maybe just on the way we realize that there're some important things in the world. That we need to save the planet. Or we start asking ourselves where're we going in the tech industry (and does it make sense to produce fake trees producing oxygen).There're of course also such issues like being persistent, brave, able to stand out and fight for your dreams.
