0,TheLittleSongbird,One problem that I found with Slither is that the gore and humour don't quite go well together for me,5,11 May 2010,"When I first saw this film at my old secondary school three years ago, I didn't like it. Then again I wasn't into comedy horrors as much then, now I don't mind them so much as long as it gives the shocks and the laughs. Re-watching it again, the film improved upon second viewing, however I still don't care for it that much. I guess it does reasonably well with what it aimed to do, which was pay homage to the outrageous splatter and surreal prosthetics of 80s horror. Now Slither grant you had its good points, but there are parts when it gets a little too ridiculous.Slither is well made, with some interesting cinematography and the special effects are excellent and do well at delivering the shocks. Also the direction from James Gunn is competent and the acting is reasonable with Nathan Fillion, Elizabeth Banks, Jenna Fisher and Michael Rooker giving decent performances. The music by Tyler Bates also has its good moments and doesn't feel intrusive.However, the story about a small town being taken over by an alien plague no matter how great the idea is is made up of a number of scenes/moments where it all gets rather ridiculous. The beginning sets the tone of the film well, but the Toxic Avenger clip was close to useless. While there were moments where I did chuckle, the script does have hits and misses. Which leads to my main problem with Slither, while there are elements of gore and horror, and there were parts that shocked me or made me chuckle, together the two elements don't quite gel. Another problem was the pacing, there are bits in the middle half that do go by very slowly.Overall, has its moments but I would be lying if I said I was not disappointed. It was an improvement on re-watch, but I for one found it nothing special. At least it did okay with what it set out to do, even if it didn't quite work as well as it should have done. 5/10 Bethany Cox",Slither
1,Leofwine_draca,Decent '80s comedy horror throwback,7,22 December 2016,"So I followed up my watching of DISTURBIA with another Hollywood production that's an instantly recognisable updating of many older themes movies. There's a bit of a difference, though, as the guys who made SLITHER are clearly fans of the cheesy monster movie sub-genre and their movie is an updating, not of a Hitchcock classic, but of a number of slimy '80s B-movies. Off the top of my head, I counted the likes of THE DEADLY SPAWN, NIGHT OF THE CREEPS, THE BLOB, and Troma as various influences here. SLITHER is a rare beast, a comedy-horror hybrid that's actually funny and scary. I always hate to see creepy worms in films and the ones found here are some of the creepiest.In essence, the plot is the same as in NIGHT OF THE CREEPS, except on a larger scale: this time, a whole town is taken over, and we see it. There's plenty of reference to the zombie flicks of old, too. One thing you notice is that the special effects are great, for the most part; the big tentacled beast is a bit overly CGI, but the worms look fine. The bathroom set-piece is particularly well down. The action-focused template keeps the movie drumming along nicely and it only put a foot wrong once for me (the gross-out scene involving the bloated woman was just too much, I thought). Nathan Fillion makes for a fine everyman hero, and Banks and Saulnier give him solid female support. Particularly good in the supporting cast is Michael Rooker, playing a guy who transforms into a monster. Rooker is usually typecast as a serial killer or a cop but he's given different material to work with here, and he's fine.Anyway, the story is simple and the situations tense. There's gore, with heads getting blown apart, and lots of grisly sequences with victims getting impregnated/taken over by the slithering worms. The climax is formulaic, but amiable enough, and as a whole I enjoyed this movie. It makes a difference when a film is made by fans for fans – as was the case with the superior NIGHT OF THE CREEPS.",Slither
2,SnoopyStyle,Good slugfest,7,1 January 2014,Starla Grant (Elizabeth Banks) is a hot teacher in the small town of Wheelsy. Her husband Grant Grant (Michael Rooker) is a bit of a jerk. He's out in the woods with a young lady and finds an alien in a meteor that had fallen close to town. He gets stuck by the alien and he begins to change. Meanwhile childhood friend Bill Pardy (Nathan Fillion) has just been promoted to Chief of Police.Everybody is playing a country bumpkin. The slugfest is more gross than scary. This is something of a goofy horror. There is good entertainment value in that. The dialog could be sharper and funnier. Writer/director James Gunn isn't the most accomplished. But this is still a playful little gross slimy time.,Slither
3,claudio_carvalho,A New Cult Movie,8,14 December 2006,"Near the deer hunting season in the small town of Wheelsy, a meteor falls in the woods with an egg of alien worm. Along the night, the local Starla Gran (Elizabeth Grant) refuses to have sex with her husband Grant Grant (Michael Rooker) and the upset man goes to a bar to have some drinks. He meets his acquaintance Brenda Gutierrez (Brenda James), the younger sister of his former girlfriend, who has a crush on him, and they go to the woods, but Grant does not have sex with her. He sees the weird egg on the grass, and when he touches it, the egg releases a sort of sparrow with an alien parasite that dominates Grant's brain. Along the next days, Grant has an insatiable hunger for meat, and while his hostage body is transforming, he builds a nest of slugs in his cellar. Grant infects Brenda and the slugs attack the human beings in Wheelsy, possessing their bodies. Starla, the local sheriff Bill Pardy (Nathan Fillion) and the survival Kylie Strutemyer (Tania Saulnier) try to find a way to stop Grant, the leader of a new breed of starving zombies.""Slither"" is certainly a new cult movie, with funny and gore situations like in ""Braindead"" or ""Shaun of the Dead"". Actually, the story is a collection of many horror and sci-fi movies, such as ""Invasion of Body Snatchers"" and ""The Night of the Living Dead"", just to mention the classics, that works perfectly, having many funny lines. The film was awarded in the category Highest Body Count in the Fangoria Chainsaw Awards, just to give an idea to the reader. The special effects, mainly with the creature that Grant is transformed, are amazingly great. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Seres Rastejantes"" (""Crawling Beings"")",Slither
4,gavin6942,"I Expected Greatness, I Got Something Better",9,16 April 2006,"The story is simple: a meteorite crashes and a deadly alien life-form is released on Earth. Much of the opening is very reminiscent of ""The Blob"". From there, it is a non-stop homage to bad horror movies and some nice gore to go with it. If you like horror humor and/or Troma, you are guaranteed to laugh out loud through this film.Initially, seeing the previews for ""Slither"" I thought the movie looked fairly cheesy. I did a little search on IMDb and found it had thst strong connection to Troma. And then two of my friends whom I find have the best taste in horror films both gave it a solid thumbs up. So I went in at that point with high hopes. I left the theater thinking they had not talked it up enough. The cast is great. Nathan Fillion from ""Firefly"" is a strong lead. Michael Rooker is perfect as a Starla-obsessed villain. Lloyd Kaufman plays his role beautifully. Rob Zombie spoke his lines better than anyone else would have. The interesting cast choice was Tania Saulnier. Based on this, you might expect she has a promising future in film. Yet, as of 2014, she has been filling mostly supporting roles. Why nothing huge?What has stuck with me the most, though, is Air Supply's ""Every Woman in the World"". There is something about really sappy classic rock that goes perfect in horror films. And you do not get any more pathetic than Air Supply. It really set the light and campy mood (as compared to other horror films using metal, signifying a more serious and violent tone).",Slither
5,jboothmillard,Slither,6,20 December 2009,"From remake of Dawn of the Dead writer James Gunn, this was a return to B-movie mixed with modern day horror I was looking forward to. Basically in the town of Wheelsy Grant Grant (Cliffhanger's Michael Rooker) goes to a bar, after his wife Starla (Spider-Man's Elizabeth Banks) refuses to have sex with him, and there he meets with Brenda Gutierrez (Brenda James). When they walk through the woods, they find the fragments of a small crashed alien meteor, and getting too close, it opens up and Grant gets a tiny parasite in his neck which goes up to and dominated his brain. Over the next few days, Grant grows increasingly hungry for meat, his infected body is changing slowly, and he is building a nest of alien slugs in the cellar. Then he infects Brenda, and she blows up to a huge bubble, and when she eventually bursts, thousands of these deadly slugs pour out, and any that get into you turn you into starving zombies. Starla joins fellow survivors Sheriff Bill Pardy (White Noise 2: The Light's Nathan Fillion) and Kylie Strutemyer (Tania Saulnier) as they try to escape the threat of these ugly bugs, and the transformed flesh-eating undead. They know the only way to end the whole thing is to kill Grant, now completely changed into a large ugly squid-like alien creature, and they do manage it. Also starring Gregg Henry as Jack MacReady, Don Thompson as Wally, Jennifer Copping as Margaret, Haig Sutherland as Trevor, Jenna Fischer as Shelby and Rob Zombie as Dr. Karl. I liked the acting, the special effects were cool, and the story was pretty good, but for me, it is the gory moments. These moments, most involving the alien slugs, were most fun to watch, as they were both scary and funny at the same time, all in all, a most watchable science-fiction horror comedy. Good!",Slither
6,Woodyanders,"Good, silly, very clever & witty B-horror/sci-fi flick fun",8,2 April 2006,"Okay, let's start this here review by stating for the record that this sure ain't no remarkably innovative or original genre-changing masterpiece of significant cinematic importance. In fact, this perfectly fun'n'funky little fright feature at heart is just your basic good'n'goofy B-movie sci-fi/horror romp that gets down to brass tacks, satisfies all the basic horror requirements (gore, thrills, action, alien parasites and ornery zombies), and benefits tremendously from a refreshing dearth of high-faluting pretense. Moreover, it's genuinely heartening to see a recent horror film that isn't yet another sequel, remake or adaptation of either a video game or comic book. Instead, this appealingly giddy'n'goofy romp harks back to such choice 80's scarefests as ""Slugs"" and especially ""Night of the Creeps."" The plot is pretty much very ordinary and run-of-the-mill stock formula stuff: a meteorite crashes in the woods nearby a sleepy podunk hick burg. Pernicious extraterrestrial slugs come out of the meteorite and taken over the body of rich local businessman Grant Grant (a deliciously juicy and dynamic performance by the great Michael Rooker of ""Henry: Portrait of A Serial Killer"" fame). Grant starts acting mighty peculiar, stockpiling vast amounts of meat and dead animal bodies in his cellar. He also impregnates the town tramp so she can reproduce more alien slugs. Naturally the slugs are unleashed and a majority of the townspeople are turned into raving ghouls who spit acid saliva and have an insatiable appetite for meat. It's up to the sheriff (winningly played by Nathan Fillion), assisted by Grant's lovely young babe trophy wife (the engagingly perky Elizabeth Banks), to try to stop the alien menace before it destroys the whole world. Yikes! Sure, the narrative is hokey, derivative, and nothing terribly new or special, but thankfully writer/director James Gunn (who wrote the surprisingly good ""Dawn of the Dead"" remake) brings a substantial amount of wit, verve and infectiously pure love and affection to the standard scenario. Gunn nicely creates a properly creepy mood in the opening third, keeps the pace crackling along at a speedy clip, and stages the shock moments with considerable brio (the scene where a beautiful teenage hottie gets attacked by the slugs while taking a bath is a real dilly). Kudos also to the uniformly solid and spirited acting by the tip-top cast: Fillion makes for a strong and likable hero, Banks is a likewise assertive and attractive heroine, and Gregg Henry is an absolute hoot as the coarse, smarmy, foul-mouthed good old boy idiot mayor. Granted, ""Slither"" is no classic, but it's plenty of easy'n'breezy undemanding fright film fun that's highly amusing and entertaining in equal measure. And that alone makes it ideal viewing for a taking a break and relaxing from it all Saturday-night-at-the-movies type of creature feature experience.",Slither
7,rmax304823,Conquering Worms.,2,1 April 2007,"In this one, poor Michael Rooker, the perennial heavy, wears a pair of square eyeglasses, has his head shaved, and is apparently sprayed with WD40 to make him look greasy.One might hope at first that this revolting figure is compensated for, at least a little, by the fact that all the principal women in the film resemble the best-looking gals in the 1975 high school yearbook from Yazoo City -- but nope. There's not enough gratuitous nudity to turn this into anything watchable.There is enough sex in disguise, though, to keep one's interest. What I mean is that, see, Michael Rooker, just before his face begins its slow disintegration into something like a giant Swedish meatball, has these ugly worms inside his upper abdomen. They crave meat. He buys them same from the supermarket but worms, like children, never being satisfied, Rooker finally yields to the craving for human meat.The whole movie -- at least the part I saw before shutting it off -- turns into a sexual metaphor. Rooker's manages to control his desire to let the worms eat his wife while she's taking a shower but he allows them to feed on a good-looking young woman of easy virtue. They're always the first to go in slasher movies. (Girls, nota bene.) Here's how he feeds his worms, these three or four phallic organisms that slip out of his stomach. He strips off his shirt. The girl strips off her hampering outer garments. He pushes her down on the bed and lies on top of her while down below the worms are drilling their way into her ivory belly with a squishy sound of the sort you might hear while stirring a giant pot of almost-ready Bechamel sauce. Her torso pumps up and down beneath him while her eyes bulge and roll and she tries to scream. If you're going to pull that at all, can't we just stick to Dracula and blood sucking? In a later scene, a girl having stuffed herself with raw meat and the worms having irrupted inside her, has swollen to the size of a small blimp, literally, with her tiny head on top, and she's still cursing her would-be rescuers for not feeding her, until she explodes and spews a new population of hungry worms all over the room and the people in it.It struck me as pretty disgusting. It isn't that horror and humor can't be fitted together. ""Q"" did a pretty good job. But who wants to see ordinary people slaughtered in the most explicit way for no particular reason. Whatever is funny about it seems just a mask provided for the use of the audience, behind which there's nothing much more complicated than a desire to see someone else suffer and be torn apart. A rubber crutch is funny too. And I don't care how many in-jokes there are.If this is your cup of tea, if you find this captivating or amusing, okay. Did you ever see the candid photos of traffic accidents hanging on the walls outside the traffic court?",Slither
8,ma-cortes,Creepy horror movie giving a paranoid dimension when frightening creatures stalking and attacking,5,25 April 2008,"The movie begins when a meteorite collides in a rural community. Grant(Michael Rooker), married to Starla(Elizabeth Banks) encounters the meteorite and is infected by a parasite and originate him a horrible turning into a creepy monster with tentacles over his chest. People are dying gruesomely ad mysteriously, the body count starts to rise and anybody has a clue what the cause is. A foul-mouthed Mayor named Jack(Gregg Henry),and the local patrolman named Bill(Nathan Fillion) are investigating the weird events.The picture packs mystery, shocks, grisly horror, but also tongue in check and black humor. The movie displays hair rising and horrifying images with lots of blood and graphical gore. This is an entertaining juvenile , quite remarkable for recreation of the carnivorous and ferocious worms developing a spooky and bloodthirsty hunger. Delivers a sympathetic homage about fifties movies and a B-film tribute. For that reason, the picture take parts from ¨Dawn of the dead(George A Romero)¨, Slugs(Juan Piquer),Society(Brian Yuzna), and The Blob(Chuck Russell), among others. Besides special appearance uncredited by Rob Zombie and Lloyd Kauffman, the famous producer and director of Troma productions, usual artificers of this type movies. The motion picture is professionally directed by James Gunn, he's usually writer(Dawn of the dead, Scooby Doo,1 and 2) and occasionally director for Troma productions . No for small kids by violent, realistic and gory attack scenes.",Slither
9,BA_Harrison,B-movie monster fun with great effects.,7,14 November 2006,"Slither is a fun slice of monster mayhem that borrows heavily from many of the genre's greatest (and not-so-greatest) hits of the past. Night of the Creeps, George Romero's Dead movies, Shivers, Society, The Blob, The Deadly Spawn: these are just a few of the films that Slither resembles in places. But even though writer/Director James Gunn may not have made the most original horror movie ever, he has made a very enjoyable one.The premise is simple: an alien arrives on Earth (via meteorite), and proceeds to inhabit the bodies of the unfortunate folk in the nearby town. The folk mutate, turn into zombies and basically behave in a manner deemed unacceptable by local policeman Bill Pardy (Nathan Fillion). Aided by beautiful school teacher Starla Grant (Elizabeth Banks) and feisty teenager Kylie Strutemyer (Tania Saulnier), he sets about teaching some manners to the extraterrestrial invader.Whilst Slither does suffer slightly from its unoriginality (and a rather slow first third), it certainly livens up considerably later on. Gunn, one-time writer and director for Troma and scribe for the recent Dawn of the Dead remake, has tons of fun throwing in as much gore, gloopy muck and gross-out FX that his budget will buy. With loads of gruesome deaths and some inventive mutated creatures, there is plenty in the way of visual trickery to keep horror fans entertained.Its not quite a 'classic', but Slither is a solidly entertaining slice of popcorn-horror and perfect viewing for a Saturday night with a few mates and some beers.",Slither
10,paul_haakonsen,"Slimy and crawling, it doesn't get much better than this...",7,24 November 2012,"""Slither"" is truly a great horror/comedy movies out there. It offers a lot of the cool things that you want in movies, plus it has some interesting people on the cast list.The story in ""Slither"" is great, because you immediately immerse yourself into the storyline and get to join along on the ride with some greatly detailed characters and personalities. And the good amount of mixed gore, horror and comedy really works out quite nicely. The movie is funny and still manages to maintain a level of seriousness to it, which really is a great combination.As for the acting, then the movie was really carried a long way by Michael Rooker (playing Grant), and he is so well cut out for this particular role.I am, and have always been, a big fan of horror movies, especially the ones that managed to incorporate humor into the genre without being tacky. ""Slither"" is great entertainment if you are into slimy crawling things. Sure it borrows heavily from other movies, but then again, does it? Or is it just a great homage to certain older movies in the genre?Regardless, ""Slither"" will leave you checking underneath your seat before you sit down and double check the toilet bowl before you sit down. Great movie, great fun, great effects, great laughs.",Slither
11,Quinoa1984,"a not too shabby Troma movie with a big studio, and effects galore",7,2 April 2006,"I've seen at least a few Troma movies over time, some almost imports (Satan's Sadists, Cannibal the Musical), other born and bred productions (Toxic Avenger and Chopper Chicks in Zombie Town), and it's at times like second generation Roger Corman, with more or less the same entertainment value. It's all fairly low-budget, with the actors hit or miss, and plenty of gore to chock up along with the over-the-top laughs. Slither, from Troma filmmaker James Gunn (also scribe on the Dawn of the Dead remake), is a bit like that, only it's been given a higher rate of visual effects, enough gore to satisfy the horror-a-week crowd (and R horror by the way), and it is creepier than could be expected. While it is definitely over the top though, maybe at times some of the possible laughs gave way to the strangeness that's going on. And make no mistake, if you don't like slugs, you may be a little uneasy throughout the second half of the film.Because Gunn, who does happen to throw a few turns of the screw in what is at the core very much a B-movie storyline (with enough 'you-know-these-types' for two common Troma flicks), has some tendencies to really make the action on screen appropriately outrageous (if that makes sense). But the thing that puts the film to be watchable even in its more discomforting moments &/or gags, is the persistence that's given to it all. The alien-slug element is not a new subject, and one could even go back to the sci-fi films of the 1950's for some similarities. It's in the shock-value and the amount of (ironically) believability that gives it the edge. Certain images like the first slug-mother (if you haven't seen it I won't explain it); moments with the slug-zombies in action; the cheesy thrills relatable to more gruesome horror films. It's not to say there's really brilliance here, but then, how could there be? For me, Slither has its lulls here and there in some of the dialog scenes (Gunn wasn't necessarily any kind of strong-point on the DOTD remake), and it has the value of a decent pulp sci-fi piece when compared to some other movies. But when the pace and terror does pick up, or there are some true laughs, its not bad at all. At the least, I could see this film having its bit of a cult, if not as big as others.",Slither
12,Coventry,"They don't make 'em like this anymore. Oh wait, ... they DO!",7,23 September 2006,"In case you're a loyal fan of horror movies, I'm pretty sure you've already heard (and probably even USED) the cliché saying in this comment's subject line. We sometimes get the impression that the only horror films Hollywood serves us nowadays are uninspired slashers and colorless remakes, all staring untalented bimbos and washed up hip hop stars that urgently need to boost up their careers by playing a film role. For all these reasons (and many more), James Gunn's ""Slither"" is an immensely joyful movie to observe, as it's a genuine homage to the cheesy, gooey and especially GORY old-school horror days! Gunn's fluently written script catapults us straight back to the 1980's, with its typical little town setting, witty redneck characters and  above all  make up effects that don't rely on advanced computer techniques. The story opens when an evil alien monster crash-lands his ""eggshell"" in the woods and literally invades the body of local town figure Grant Grant (Michael Rooker). Grant then impregnates a slutty townsgirl and she ""gives birth"" to thousands of eerie slugs that go on infecting the rest of the villagers. Grant's loving wife Starla teams up with the Sheriff, who's also her biggest admirer, to battle the slugs and prevent total elimination of the hunting town's population. Judging by James Gunn's age and background, he grew up during one of the golden eras of horror and this is clearly noticeable by the amount of tributes and references he put into his own film! Little aspects and gimmicky ideas from ""Basket Case"" over ""The Blob"" onto ""Tremors"" all feature in ""Slither"" and yet never at one point the film becomes overly hectic or stupid. It doesn't contain much tension or originality, but that largely gets compensated by the imaginative splatter. Grant gradually turns into a large-sized pile of slimy smut (similar to Brian Yuzna's ""Society"") that sucks innocent villagers into his stomach...or something like that. Other people get their head blown to pieces by a shotgun, or entirely eaten by the slugs and one poor sucker is even cut in half by Grant's tentacles. The dialogues are often hilarious, particularly the mayor is quite a character, and the cast members all seem very happy to be a part of this production.",Slither
13,michaelRokeefe,Seat-squirming comic horror.,6,16 November 2006,"Kudos to director James Gunn for this fun Sci-Fi, horror, comedy combo. This is a real hoot! A sleepy little town called Wheelsy, with a foul-mouthed mayor Jack MacReady(Gregg Henry)and a brand new sheriff Bill Pardy(Nathan Fillion), is plagued by evil from outer space that resembles over-sized slugs. Farm livestock are mutilated and a young woman goes missing; also the town's richest citizen Grant Grant(Michael Rooker)begins to act very strangely. These squirming slithering invaders intend to absorb and devour all mankind.

14,hitchcockthelegend,"The rural town of Wheelsy, host to all weird and wonderful slimy things",7,3 October 2010,"Slither is written and directed by James Gunn and stars Nathan Fillion, Elizabeth Banks, Michael Rooker, Gregg Henry & Tania Saulnier.For his debut full length feature film, James Gunn has paid homage to the B movie sci-fi and horror schlockers that he fell in love with over the years. Accepting this from the off and not expecting something totally fresh will, one feels, enhance the viewing experience. On its initial release the film was met with some laughable criticism from internet dwellers upset that Gunn's movie was lifting from some of their favourite low grade shockers. Laughable because it's not like he was trying to hide it. Besides which, Slither is actually a hugely enjoyable film, a loving homage, not a rip-off, and part of the fun is spotting the references in the film. Be it scenes or snatches of music and dialogue.The premise is pure sci-fi schlock, after a meteorite crashes in the rural town of Wheelsy, the unfortunate Michael Rooker finds that it was not a good idea to go investigate the pulsing thing out on the grass. Pretty soon he is resembling an alien squid thingy and after taking a ""partner"" (Brenda James) it's not long before thousands of bloody coloured slugs are attacking the town and turning them into zombies. Enter a small band of misfits led by Fillion's sheriff who start to fight back.What follows are a series of gooey scenes a freak out moments played for fun by a cast enjoying themselves playing OTT characters. With some of the dialogue that accompanies said scenes laugh out loud funny. Most of the comedy falls to Fillion and Henry, who in turn provide deadpan and uproarious delivery. While it's nice to have not one, but two spunky heroines in the shapely forms of Banks and Saulnier. It could be argued a touch that entering the last straight the hat tipping nods are looking tired, while an attempt to make Rooker's creature sympathetic like Frankenstein/Brundlefly seems out of place. But two itches aside, this is undeniably a funny and gloopy treat. What it lacks in fresh ideas it more than makes up for in its ability to entertain whilst doing credit to the genres it is born from. 7/10",Slither
15,Hey_Sweden,Have some Mr. Pibb on hand while watching. But no calamari.,8,10 March 2013,"Former Troma employee James Gunn pays homage to vintage genre fare with this very knowing, splatter heavy, and delicious horror comedy that thankfully doesn't skimp on the horror. As often as it's making one laugh, it's making them squirm thanks to a very effective gross-'em-out factor. It's lively, irresistible fun, and the love for the genre shows. Horror fans can always tell when a film is made by one of their own.It may not be terribly original, but that IS sort of the point here. The story has a meteor landing on Earth, in the woods near the town of Wheelsy, and soon after discharging a slimy little alien worm that infects local fat cat Grant Grant (Michael Rooker), who in record time mutates into something pretty cool while stockpiling all of the local pets as food and recruiting the towns' populace as lumbering zombies.As one can see, the 1986 film ""Night of the Creeps"" had to have been one of the prominent influences. Gunn references other films through character names: one is named Earl Basset, another is R.J. MacReady, and yet another is dubbed Max Renn.Much of the humour derives from the characters' thunderstruck reaction to the various alien manifestations, which as created by Todd Masters' effects company are wonderful to behold. Grant ends becoming something rather amazing, with a particularly hideous fate saved for one of the female characters. The biggest laughs tend to be supplied by cast member Gregg Henry, who's hilarious as the complaining, foul mouthed mayor, but Rooker is pretty damn funny himself.Nathan Fillion (""Serenity"", 'Castle') is quite engaging as the easygoing sheriff, and Elizabeth Banks is lovely and endearing as his leading lady. Tania Saulnier, Brenda James, and Don Thompson are likewise quite good; Gunns' then-wife Jenna Fischer ('The Office') appears as the dispatcher, Rob Zombie contributes a voice only cameo as Dr. Karl, and Gunns' former boss Lloyd Kaufman can be seen as a drunk in the police station.With its many gleefully gory moments, its solid cast, its combination of chuckles and chills, its in-jokes, and hip soundtrack, ""Slither"" makes for great entertainment. Sadly, it didn't do very well during its theatrical run, but it DID develop a following all the same. It's well worth watching for horror and sci-fi fans.Eight out of 10.",Slither
16,preppy-3,Wanted to like it but couldn't,6,8 April 2006,"A comic homage to sci-fi films of the 1950s updated with extreme violence.

Soon the slugs are infecting everybody and its up to the sheriff, Grant's wife and a plucky teenager (Tania Saulnier) to save the town.Horror comedies are hard to pull off--they can become either too gross or too funny. Only a few have pulled this off--""Evil Dead II"", ""Re-Animator"", ""Night of the Creeps"" and ""Dead Alive"". Unfortunately this isn't as good as those. The cast does play it straight (wisely) and it's well-made with some great (if disgusting) special effects. But the humor and horror never mesh comfortably. I DID laugh out loud a few times and was impressed by the gross out effects--but the movie was always wavering uncomfortably between the two. It never found even footing. It's not terrible and the cast is good--but I still wasn't entertained. LOTS of plot holes too. I can only give this a 6.",Slither

Extremely disappointing horror film that promised so much...",6,16 May 2006,"Slither starts late one night in the small American town of Wheelsy as police chief Bill Pardy (Nathan Fillion) & his deputy Wally (Don Thompson) try to pass the time as best they can, however unknown to them a short distance away a small meteorite from outer space lands & cracks open...

Grant pokes it with a stick & a parasitic alien shoots out & attachés itself to Grant & burrows it's way inside him & takes over his brain & body. Over the next few days things turn weird in Wheelsy as Brenda disappears, lots of local pets disappear & Grant begins to change into something nasty. Eventually the town of Wheelsy is invaded by alien slugs that enter peoples bodies through they're mouths & turn them into alien controlled cannibalistic zombies, it's up to Bill, Starla & a young girl named Kylie (Tania Saulnier) to put an end to the alien slugs & prevent the entire world from becoming one huge breeding & feeding ground for them...This Canadian American co-production was written & directed by James Gunn, who also has a small uncredited role in the film, & I have to admit to being throughly disappointed with it. The first thing I will say is that it's a good, decent horror comedy that's watchable but I was expecting & hoping for so much more. The script is actually quite dull, I never would have thought a film about parasitic alien slugs would be dull but Slither manages it with aplomb. The character's are very poorly written & are virtually none existent, the filmmakers might as well have used cardboard cutouts, I never felt like I knew anyone & as a result I never cared about anyone. The filmmakers idea of comedy is to have a few comedy relief character's spout some stupid deadpan one-liner every so often, the horror side of things don't improve as while there's a fair amount of zombies, aliens, tentacles, slime & some gore nothing in Slither is original & I found it surprisingly low-key in a low budget kind of way, nothing in Slither excited me, scared me or made me laugh. The first twenty odd minutes are frankly boring although to be fair to it it does pick up considerably as it moves along. I saw Slither in a cinema here in the UK, during the first twenty minutes people would freely get up to go to the toilet or shop so I don't think I was the only one who shared that opinion & once Slither had finished everyone left the cinema very quietly, there was no buzz, no enthusiasm & no excitement as everyone just sort of shuffled out in silence.Director Gunn does a decent job & Slither is well made with some neat special effects. He pays homage to loads of other horror films & it's obvious he is a fan of the genre & those involved in it, films like The Blob (1988), A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984), Night of the Living Dead (1968), The Thing (1982), Shivers (1975), Night of the Creeps (1986), The Faculty (1998) are all referenced to. However there is a fine line between homage & rip off which I believe Slither crosses too many times as a lot of it's best ideas & scenes are clearly taken from other films. The slimy alien looks pretty good but by the end it looks like a mass of rubber more than anything else. I found the gore somewhat disappointing, there are a few gory animal carcasses, someone has a metal bar shoved through their throat, someone is split in half vertically & their guts fall out, there are a few gory head shots & a touch of cannibalism but I didn't think it had much impact as it was pretty jokey. I also felt a lot of scenes in Slither were there so the audience would point & say 'oh look that's cool' rather than 'that's scary'.With a supposed budget of about $15,500,000 Slither is well made, there's some nice CGI effects, some nice prosthetic effects & slimy aliens. It's competent & has a nice style throughout. The acting was OK but nobody felt like a real person, Banks is pretty hot.Slither disappointed me, I still think it's a perfectly watchable & entertaining film but I was expecting, no I was hoping for more which never materialised. Worth a watch but I think I'd have totally forgotten about it by the end of the week. I love the horror genre but generally speaking I don't like modern horror that much & Slither has done very little to change that opinion.",Slither

The special/make-up effects here are among the grossest ever - the creature Michael Rooker eventually turns into, the massive fat entity his ""girlfriend"" becomes and the repeated scenes of bugs entering people's mouths - but this is partially redeemed by a smart script and amiable performances, especially the foul-mouthed Mayor played by Gregg Henry and leading lady Elizabeth Banks as Rooker's wife; Tania Saulnier's good looks certainly don't hurt either.

Plot regards slugs that arrive from space and inhabit human targets. Setup actually works because the screenplay develops the characters and environment without rushing into chaos, however from there very little happens other than slugs attacking people. With an ending that seems hopeless director James Gunn somehow brings feeling into it. Michael Rooker is first infected while in the midst of an affair. The emotional core in how his wife, played by Elizabeth Banks still loves him, despite their marriage problems. Nathan Fillion plays a cop who has a thing for Banks, and forms a search party for Rooker who has become a large slug like creature not bent on negotiating. Gregg Henry brings comic relief as a cynical Mayor. We know that things are not set to conclude well for Rooker. We also know that Fillion and Banks will reconnect after this catastrophe is over and done. Henry as the mayor stole his scenes so well that when he is attacked, I felt bad for the loss. This is not a great horror film but it is amusing camp filmmaking that may remind target fans of such films of the 1950's.

25,kannibalcorpsegrinder,Fun modern take of an 80s Cheesfest,10,25 August 2015,"Following a meteorite crash nearby, a small-town is overrun by voracious parasites from a possessed towns-person and forces the sheriff to round- up the remaining unaffected to stop the infestation before more fall victim to the creatures.This was quite an enjoyable and often hilarious creature feature. One of the better aspects here is the rather enjoyable feel of constantly keeping something new going for it, never going for what should've been an obvious ploy and generating a lot of interesting twists. The initial start here is all perfectly in line for this one to be an alien invasion effort, yet instead this is a parasite-induced effort with zombie slaves controlled with an insect-like hive-mind from the center source which is pretty novel here because as well as the change in the second half where it becomes more about the parasites rather than staying with the deformed creature. The action throughout here features all manner of interesting notions here, furthering that storyline as well as giving this one another impressive facet here. This one manages to keep offering plenty of enjoyable encounters here, from the initial possession in the forest, the attack on the town floozy in her home and the initial farmland attack out in the woods where they first meet up with his now grossly-deformed appearance all providing some fun throughout here. Once into the woods, the teams' encounter with the parasite-infested host is a stellar scene that brings about a cheesy source of action as the expanding body rips open and unleashes the ravenous creatures upon the troops which unleashes the over-the-top final half with this one going for the parasite assault on the farm- house and later bringing the zombified parents into this for some chills mixed into the cheese that carries along into the zombies overrunning the town with their slave-like hive-minded behavior allowing for the fun getting deeper into their territory. This sets up the great fun in the finale with the house assault rescue attempt leading to the final confrontation with the inhuman blob-like being that features prominently in this scenes, gets a few laughs and overall making for a lot of fun. Along with the fantastic make-up on the creatures and a nice bit of cheese here, these are more than enough to hold out over the few flaws here. One of the main ones is the lack of explanations given to the initial invasion as there's nothing about why they invaded here, choose that town or the purpose of their take-over which leaves a lot of unanswered questions about the creatures. The only other problem are is the lack of investigations taking place throughout here, for the asteroid appearing is never seen being investigated or even known about, the disappearing animals raise more interest than the people and the lack of action here really does seem limiting toward the police. Still, this one was incredibly enjoyable regardless.Rated R: Extreme Graphic Violence, Extreme Graphic Language, Nudity and scenes of animal slaughter and aftermath.",Slither
26,Aaron1375,Very good and icky horror comedy.,9,16 April 2006,"Considering all the mediocre horror movies that have made a rather sizable chunk of money at the box office it is a bit surprising that this one isn't doing really anything at all. I found it highly entertaining...good gross out effects, and it was funny too. Granted it is not the most original movie made as it seems to borrow a lot of elements from other horror movies (""Night of the Creeps"", ""Society"", and any zombie movie) it is still done very well. The story, nothing new, meteor crashes into a typical rural town...person finds said meteor and gets taken over by an alien. It plays out great though as the characters in this flick are very good. The sheriff is done well as is the guy taken over by the alien and his wife. Though by far the funniest character for me was the mayor. Plenty of gore in this one too, and the special effects are done well as well. You will be saying ick a lot, but you will also be laughing too, a bizarre combination to be sure, but hey it works here. You have some zombies here sort of, you have your weird slug creatures and you have a lot of kills as well.

27,The_Void,Lovely little tribute to old-school horror!,7,5 September 2006,"Even though Slither isn't completely successful in achieving everything it set out to, it's an enjoyable ride and certainly one of the better horror films of the last couple of years. Prior to seeing the film, I'd heard it was a rip-off of the eighties cult classic 'Night of the Creeps', and while I can certainly see why people would say that - the film features ideas from a range of Sci-Fi and horror films, and overall I would say it's better to simply enjoy writer-director James Gunn's imagination and inventiveness rather than worry about who thought of the various plot points and themes first. The film begins with a meteorite falling to Earth. Around the same time, the amusingly named Grant Grant is trying to get it on with his wife, but she refuses his advances and he goes for a walk...to the local pub. After hooking up with some chick he used to know, the pair go walking through the same field that the meteor landed in, and pretty soon Mr Grant has found himself with the alien life form inside him. It's not long before the entire town is feeling Grant's misfortune, when they all become zombies and various mutants! The film features an excellent turn from the brilliant Michael Rooker; a severely underused actor and one of my favourites. While he unfortunately doesn't get a great deal of screen time; he's well used and a great choice to play the alien's unfortunate victim. The central cast are all pretty good, with Elizabeth Banks doing well in her role and providing nice candy alongside Tania Saulnier, and Nathan Fillion, who was the best thing about last year's Serenity. The special effects are something of a mixed bag, and mostly consisting of CGI. At times, it looks good; but sometimes it looks cheap, the special effects on the worms being the main offender in this department. James Gunn does a good job at directing, and he might be someone to keep an eye on as he does well at creating terror and there are several sequences in the film that are really well executed. The film starts off slowly, and builds into something of a horror romp with a number of ideas coming off well. It does feel a little bit flat, however, and Slither could have been a masterpiece if it had a bit more bite. Still, I'm not complaining as this film is always good fun to watch.",Slither
28,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Slither,7,4 June 2006,"We've seen a slew of horrific gore movies hitting the screens lately, from Saw to Hostel, some hits, some misses, some remakes, brought to us by a new age group of horror directors like Darren Lynn Bousman, Eli Roth and Alexandre Aja. Slither, written and directed by James Gunn, continues the blood fad with them slimy creatures combined with zombies who walk the earth.Don't bother figuring out the whys and the hows, and forget about the plot, which has holes punched right through by the introductory meteorite. Just sit back and enjoy whatever thrills and spills this movie throws at you. It's great mindless fun as you see slimy red worms forcing their way into their prey's (read: humans) mouths, in order to take over control, kinda like Invasion of Body Snatchers. During this state, the humans will walk, talk, act like generic zombies, minus the strength, but the lust for human MEAT still remains. Oh, did I mention it was a bit phallic looking, the way the worms force their entry into the human mouth? M18 it screams.As always, with horror movies like these, the chicks score in the looks department, and little else. Serenity/Firefly's Captain Mal lends some die-hard action chops as Bill, cop extraordinaire, probably picking up lessons from John McClane in staying alive despite unsurmountable odds. Again there are plenty of throwaway characters, as they serve only the sole purpose of increasing the bodycounts.The main villain in the movie is this meteorite carrying some space alien which is making its rounds cannibalizing planet inhabitants. So Earth is next on the radar, and it found its host in unsuspecting Grant (Michael Rooker), whose young wife Starla (Elizabeth Banks, Spiderman's Betty Brant) is lusted after by Bill. Starla turns out to be one faithful spouse, and it is exactly those matrimonial vows that Grant takes a mickey of when things go horribly wrong. Characterization take a backseat here, as the target audience is only interested in who's gonna be the next victim of a spectacular death sequence. It took a while for the set up though, so be prepared to be a little bored by the first act.The special effects team did a tremendous job in bringing the gooey slithery slimeball worms to life, and empowering the zombies with green icky spit. Then again, dumb newbie zombies don't know how to fully harness their powers. There are many of the usual splice-and-dice scenes with innards pouring out, but somehow they still provided me with the usual kicks. Same goes for the close quarter combats, and those up close gunfire.All in all, it's quite enjoyable, from a warped point of view. It's part Aliens, part Living Dead, part Anaconda, part everything that moves on its belly. Stay tuned until after the ending credits for one forgettable sequence.",Slither
29,christopher-underwood,Good disgusting fun,8,6 October 2009,"This is really very well done and great fun to watch, provided you have a strong stomach. There is much that is amusing here but it is undeniably gross. The nasty slimy little alien slug like critters move so horribly, so certainly and so viciously as they strive to imbed and multiply within the brains of humans. Horror and comedy are an often uneasy mix but here the horror really is such that you are almost forced to look away whilst the humour runs alongside and not tempering the nastiness. Everyone acquits themselves well and though the makers may deny it this looks very much like somebody saw more potential in the 1986, Night of the Creeps, than did even the makers of that decent little movie. Very similar set up and very similar slugs, but hey, they were crying out to be made more of and James Gunn certainly comes good with this. Probably not suitable for a first date or even to be watched whilst eating. Come to that probably not recommended if you are about to eat or even have just eaten. Good disgusting fun.",Slither

At the time, these movies were revolutionary. Now, such a movie is categorized as an homage or a comedy.The effects are OK, the atmosphere is scary/funny, which I don't think it's a plus, and the script is utterly predictable. I wish I had something more to say, but I really don't. I expected some low budget movie with a lot of gore, it's actually less gory and more high budget, but the average is just the same.Warning to future horror movie directors and screen writers: when you make a combination of all the movies you've seen on a subject, you get an average of them, not a sum.",Slither
31,StevePulaski,"Define ""Troma"" before you enter",7,29 October 2011,"While trying to be its own thing, Slither gives a big nod to underrated horror films that are overshadowed by the slasher killer and his sequels. James Gunn successfully pays homage to films like Basket Case, Empire of the Ants, Frogs, Night of the Creeps, The Toxic Avenger, and many other Troma films. There's even one scene where it shows the name of the school is ""Earl Bassett Community School."" If you don't know Tremors, then you just won't get it.Despite being unique and marketable, Slither failed at the box office. When asked about the failure, producer Paul Brooks claimed ""[...]Because it was comedy-horror instead of pure horror is where the problem lay. It's the first comedy-horror in a long time, and maybe the marketplace just isn't ready for comedy-horror yet. It's difficult to think of other explanations."" I don't think it's necessarily that as much as it is the subject matter. Many mainstream movie-goers do not know what Troma is, so likely, the concept of Slither and the resurrection of creature-features didn't quite register with them.The plot: A meteor that has a number of alien-like worms crashes into the town of Woodsville one day and a car-dealer named Grant (Rooker) is the first to be infected. He becomes very sickly, and his wife, a teacher named Starla (Banks), questions his health when he begins missing out on his doctor appointments. She then discovers what is going on with Grant, and realizes that he has now been taken over by a mutant-slug monster.I, myself, wasn't concerned with the plot as much I was concerned with the creatures. Sure, I like a little backstory, but here, none of the characters truly matter because usually the creatures are thrown in the foreground. I can accept that. The creatures are about forearm length long, they wiggle, they're slimy, and they force themselves into your mouth so they can take over your body and form one of the most disgusting monsters in recent film.The visuals are actually quite realistic. Whatever a mutant, meat-eating slug is supposed to look like, they sure nailed it. So what's the problem? It's hard to say. For one, this is the first time, I'd say, Elizabeth Banks has been bad in a film. Her character is a mannequin most of the time, and the film uses her for good scream scenes and the stereotypical damsel in distress. Her purpose in the film is to be scared by monsters, and ogled at by her students.Another problem is this is one of those creature films where the pacing isn't put into great effectiveness. But I think Slither makes up for it by having some great shots of the worms, and some great scenes that you can't help but wiggle at.James Gunn clearly wanted to give a serious tribute film to all those horror films that have been left in the dust. I can respect that, and the turnout is a lot like all those films I listed before - simple, yet mostly entertaining. Slither is just a hair away from a recommendation mainly because there isn't a whole lot going on for a lot of the film besides characters walking around and doing their own thing. The final minutes with the slug monster are wholly entertaining and very crafty. This is truly a ""patience is a virtue"" type film.Starring: Nathan Fillion, Michael Rooker, Elizabeth Banks, and Gregg Henry. Directed by: James Gunn.",Slither

But recently, I have been hearing more and more about Sliter, how much of a cult classic it's becoming and how many fans there are. Not to mention that it has a decent rating on IMDb, so I decided to wait for the rental. Slither reminded me of The Blob meets Squirm, only it had a great mix of horror and comedy.Sliter is about a meteor that hits the Earth and Grant and his mistress happen to be right next to it, and Grant gets attacked by one of the creatures that appear to be slug like and turns him into a giant slimy slug! This slug impregnates a female human causing her to become this giant ball like slug carrying... thing! She explodes causing over billions of slugs to get into the human's mouths and makes them into zombies! Slither is cheesy, but it's the good kind that has a great reminder of the B-movies from the 80's. That's what was so clever about it, not to mention the great and funny dialog that seemed so natural and reminded me of Shaun of the Dead.

From the get-go its chock full of references to other genre pics and pretty clearly wears its influences on its sleeve. It's a good natured affair that embraces its B-movie credentials. It's certainly good fun and it does manage to combine the alien invasion, animals attack and zombie subgenres all into one. Which is a pretty neat trick I guess. But despite it being fairly inventive, I thought it kind of ran out of steam a bit as it went on. I found it overall a bit middling if I'm honest, even if I acknowledge that it's a pretty well made effort. Also of note is the fact it stars Michael Rooker of Henry Portrait of a Serial Killer fame.

36,Robert_duder,"An absolute classic monster, alien, horror film!! Instant!!",8,22 April 2006,"Slither is downright brilliant hitting the mark on every one of what it tries to be. It never tries to be pretentious or important, or even successful but I just have this feeling it will sit on the shelf of monster movie history. In some ways it's extremely unique and fun with and certainly carbon copies itself from numerous successes and classics and why the hell not??!! People are complaining about this?? Doesn't nearly every movie do this?? At least Slither does everything within it's boundaries and doesn't pretend to be anything but. Invasion of the Body Snatchers?? Check. The Blob?? Check. Night of The Living Dead?? Check. Bloody, gory, creepy, hardcore B-Movie good time?? CHECK CHECK!!Not to blow my own horn but I've predicted Nathon Fillion's rise to stardom since the very first moment on Joss Whedon's completely under appreciated Firefly. Or his performance as the frighteningly evil Caleb on Buffy The Vampire Slayer. In Slither he plays redneck Sheriff Bill Pardy complete with his Firefly accent in tact. Everyone's role is kind of small in Slither. In fact it's more about the gore and story than anything but for what his character is Nathon Fillion does a great job. I think he has the chops to be a big star and although a small B-Movie like this one might not make that happen he's still fun to watch. Elizabeth Banks plays the object of Fillion's affections Starla Grant. She's also the wife of Grant Grant...yep Grant Grant...how great is that?? Banks is the scream queen of the film and does it well. She isn't used as quite the sex object that most scream queens would be used for but she does plenty of screaming and she's a bit of a stronger character than most. Michael Rooker plays one of the best roles as Grant Grant who during an almost indiscretion with another woman is infected with the slug like creatures that make him a host to their alien entities. Rooker is a nice guy to start with and you nearly for sorry for him as the aliens take him over. He's kind of the killer or bad guy but not really because he's been possessed so to speak. Great character actor Gregg Henry plays wise cracking, foul mouthed mayor Jack MacReady. He's the obligatory funny man who you know is gonna die painfully because everyone can't stand him.Slither is no holds barred gory...a real ""R"" rated blood fest thank goodness because it would barely be half the movie it is without being gory and disgusting. On top of that it has some moments that I think will stick out in my mind as horror genre classics. When they find Brenda completely blown to the size of a blimp and she mutters...""I'm so hungry,"" that is just too cool. Revolting!! Grant's transformation that looks like a horrific rash, and the gutting of all the animals as he tries to feed his hunger. Fairly newcomer writer and director James Gunn I think has created something that won't go away easily. On the surface of this being a monster film rip off, or typical is something far more unique. Consider when the girl in the bathtub nearly gets infested and sees flashes of these things on their home planet...very curious and interesting and far more depthy than you would have expected. Someone who comes across this film by accident will probably be revolted and turned off by it but if you're a real true fan of B-Movie and horror classics this one is an absolute must!! It's truly for us fans and you'll love it if you go into it for exactly what it is. 8/10",Slither
37,bowmanblue,Old School Gory monster fun,7,4 December 2019,"Every time I see a review of 'Slither' I see how it's a 'homage' to John Carpenter's classic monster movie 'The Thing.' Now, it just so happens that 'The Thing' is one of my favourite films of all time. Therefore, you'd probably thing that I spotted every single reference/homage to it contained in 'Slither.' I didn't. Not to say that I didn't enjoy 'Slither,' but now I've seen it about five times and I can only spot the similarities that both films contain huge, gross monsters and there's mention of a character called 'MacReady' thrown into the mix.But enough about 'The Thing...' What you have here is a film that's made by someone (James Gunn actually - long before his rise to fame with the 'Guardians of the Galaxy' saga) with a real love of the 'monster/horror' genre. We see an alien parasitic lifeform come to Earth and land in one of those small American towns that always seem to get affected by this sort of paranormal shenanigans. And soon the locals are overrun by thousands of slug-type things that - yes, you guessed it - slither their way into people's bodies in order to take them over.Back when it was released in 2006, not many people really thought of Michael Rooker as a household name. And, I guess he still isn't today. However, the horror/sci-fi community probably knows him as 'Merle' from 'The Walking Dead' or 'that blue guy' from 'Guardians of the Galaxy.' Now, whether you're aware of his career or not, he's one of those actors who always puts in an excellent performance no matter how big or small his role is. I'm pretty sure to say that it's not much of a 'spoiler' to say that he's the first member of the community to get 'infected' by the alien slug and we spend a fair amount of the story witnessing his transformation into, well, something much, much worse!Those most affected by his actions are his wife (played by Elizabeth Banks) and the town's sheriff (Nathan Fillion) who just so happens to have a bit of a long-term 'crush' on Banks' character (no prizes for guessing where that plot thread will lead!). Both are likable enough heroes, but besides Rooker, special mention should go to the town's resident idiot (Gregg Henry) who plays every scene he's in for laughs - and he succeeds massively there without ever really being annoying.Yes, there's a lot of gore. Whereas 'The Thing' used 'practical effects' 'Slither' does use computer generated trickery here and there. Bearing in mine it was filmed in 2006 without what you'd exactly call a 'mega budget' you'll probably notice which effects have been added on, but it's at its best when it too uses rubber and latex to really gross us out. Plus be prepared for much of the gore to come in the final act. The first two thirds of the movie are mainly set-up (with one brilliant scene in a barn that has to be seen to believed - all I'll say is that it's like a modern day 'Mr Creosote' sketch!).In plot terms it's nothing that you haven't encountered before if you're a fan of the genre. However, it seems to have been made with such love and affection (and, yes, it knows what it is and plays to its strengths!) that, if you're into ridiculously disgusting 'body horror' with a fair helping of monsters added for good measure, then definitely give this one a go. It's the sort of film that doesn't require much brainpower to appreciate, but it's all the better for it.",Slither
38,Cineanalyst,Cronenberg Pastiche,5,11 November 2020,"""Slither"" is a somewhat amusing if lightweight diversion and a pastiche of other body-horror flicks, especially those by David Cronenberg. The retracting, projectile phallus emerging from a vaginal-like cavity seems to be taken straight from ""Rabid"" (1977), whereas the phallic parasite creature in the bathtub scene is even more obviously from ""Shivers"" (1975). Additionally, a clip from ""The Toxic Avenger"" (1984) is seen on TV briefly, and others have seen similarities with other horror films that I'm less familiar with, including ""Night of the Creeps"" (1986) and probably some Japanese pictures. Regardless, the imitative intent is obvious, and it's treated somewhat humorously as if a parody.The directorial debut of James Gunn, his talent for unoriginal but slick productions is already evident here. It's a skill that has served him well in making superhero movies (""Super"" (2010), ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" 1 (2014) and 2 (2017), etc.) that are slightly more palatable than much of their ilk, but hardly clever beyond poking fun at their own genre.I viewed this because I've been seeking out a bunch of pandemic-related movies. It's the same reason I've caught up on some Cronenberg films. ""Slither"" is somewhat more relatable to the situation in 2020, I suppose, as the characters at one point put scarves or masks over their faces to prevent the parasitic disease from slithering into their mouths. It hardly makes up, however, for the incredulous lack of sex here despite a bunch of phalluses slithering around and tentacles inserting themselves in victims. They try to compensate some with love, instead, but, no, that doesn't work. I mean, c'mon, the grotesque horror already gets you an R-rating, and it's already a trashy B-picture, so go crazy with it.",Slither
39,sol-,Shivers,7,22 July 2017,"A meteorite carrying alien life crashes down in the woods of a small Canadian town with horrific results when one local citizen discovers it in this affectionate tribute to the horror B-movies of yesteryear. While the makeup and special effects are remarkable and there are several neat genre in-jokes, the best aspect of 'Slither' is the fact that the direction in which the material is going is deliciously unclear at first. At certain times, the film seems to be heading in the direction of an alien parasite thriller with the ""worms"" wrapping around the brain of victims and assuming control. At other times, the movie seems headed in a 'Shivers' sexually transmitted disease direction with phallic appendages that emerge from the first victim's stomach when aroused by female victims to-be. The direction in which the film ultimately heads is less interesting than either of these, and evil is overcome a tad too easily in the end, however, it is still a fairly gripping ride with standout sequences including the bathroom incident referenced on the film's poster and DVD cover, and a sequence in which some townsfolk discover what happened to a woman who mysteriously disappeared after an intimate night with the first victim. Michael Rooker (probably best known nowadays for 'Mallrats') is excellent in the main male role, while Elizabeth Banks brings a nice degree of unexpected spunk as the heroine here.",Slither
40,merklekranz,Moves right along and never quits...,7,13 December 2006,"Something many quickie horror-comedies forget is character development. Here, there is an attempt to develop some before the carnage begins. In fact, fewer characters to develop might have made the movie a little more enjoyable. Though somewhat rushed to conclusion, and perhaps trying to cover too much ground, ""Slither"" is a solid 6.5-7.0 and good of it's type. This might have been a better movie if less sensationalism had been incorporated and more logic, but then anybody along for a horror movie ride, is extremely forgiving, and the fast moving story obviously overcomes plot holes the size of Cincinnati. For comparison, I rate ""Re-Animator"" 7.5, ""The Thing""(1982) 7.5, and ""Tremors"" 7.0 - MERK",Slither
41,johnnyboyz,"Wrigling its way between the lines of gross out horror and goofy, dumb humour; Slither doesn't quite connect with its familiar and usually enjoyable premise.",5,4 April 2010,"Slither is the sort of film that's easy to pitch but relatively tough to pull off. The amalgamation of gory, schlocky horror with comedy; usually of a dark and farcical nature, seems to be the name of the game here, but they don't quite connect. I do think American director James Gunn has a better film inside of him, one that's more mature and less plodding, one that's more focused; one that can combine his 'eye' for the ability to get the maximum out of an icky horror infused scenario with content a tad more interesting for the audience than some grotesquely obese alien-human hybrid's love for his former wife. Regardless, in a recent world full so many daft horror remakes and Saw sequels; I can see why a 'fun' B-movie homage has been seen as such a welcoming tonic. The film tells the story of a handful of people stuck in one of those small American towns in the middle of nowhere with an impending mass-incoming of monsters or beasties of some kind. The pandemic in this case derives from an asteroid-like object which hits Earth in this very town, a sleepy and dreary place in which one of the better jokes of the film involves getting across exactly that notion when a speed gun is used on local birds flying past a police speed trap; this as something far larger travelling much faster crash lands behind them. One of those officers is Bill Pardy (Fillion), the film's lead. The large rock is a spaceship of sorts, harbouring strange bug-like body-snatchers which get inside of you with intent of all things nasty. But this is not the sort of science fiction film about interactions with extra terrestrials that runs on ideas of substance. For many, Slither will be no Close Encounters of the Third Kind.On the contrary, whilst this certainly takes inspiration from such sci-fi/horror greats like Invasion of the Body Snatchers, it unfortunately more resembles Independence Day: fast, somewhat witty but ultimately dumb – these monsters are here to harm and cause conflict, not interact and inspire a film of any substantial weight. In fact, it's from Independence Day which I'm reminded of Will Smith's line: ""I don't think they flew a zillion light years to start a fight."" Although, it turned out that's exactly what they were here to do; and in Slither, a similar process of hunting and destroying all forms of life on each planet is applied. One wonders if they landed at Mercury and Venus first, only to be disappointed it was devoid of life, or if they've just got used to going to the third planet in from each solar-system's sun every time in an educated guess to uncover life.Michael Rooker's character Grant Grant, so archetypal they named him twice, bears the early brunt of this slug-like; parasite-like alien, his insatiable sexual appetites getting him into all sorts of bother in an isolated wood with a woman of equal thought process of whom he essentially rapes later on. In a rather funny, self-aware jab at the material; a scene nearer the beginning on another strand sees a teacher at the end of giving a class on Darwinism, someone renowned for theories of evolution and the developing and changing of a species – although, the content in that scene which did it for me revolved around the mentioning of 'the survival of the fittest', two items that essentially represent the bulk of the film.Unfortunately, Slither lurches from some rather nasty, uninvolving and leery content early on to do with Grant's going mad and lust for raw meat; staggering from this to another group of characters getting all excited, in that way only people of this ilk can, when drunkard goings-on in celebration of the beginning of deer hunting season unfold. The group is led by naive, gung-ho politician Jack MacReady (Henry), the local mayor; who is the most politically powerful but is additionally established to be the thickest and most ill-suited for the job. The character is a Geroge W. Bush incarnation, as the one person who's most inept at taking charge at leading a bunch of slack-jawed, gun wielding guys into a war zone; a war zone in which an easy victory is expected over a relatively inferior foe. This bunch, of whom are mostly just fodder for the beasties, however, romp out into the nearby woodland or into the rural unknown in hope of blowing away some easy competition for sport, but stumble across something far more sinister and much more powerful than they earlier imagined.Whilst MacReady is a daft allegorical character, he is given some of the film's best lines; my favourite of which is: ""What kind of thing wants you to eat it!?"" The film is not preoccupied with character nor script, despite the fun it has with MacReady and desperately attempts to include a third sub-strand in which young local girl Kylie Strutemyer (Saulnier) undergoes a process that'll see her jump from raw, vulnerable, and stark naked in the bath to gun wielding, hard bodied, zombie-ass kicking chick by way of her family falling prey and the world as she knows it going to Hell. This lying naked, and falling naked, out of a bath to avoid one of the film's pesky slug creatures might be seen as a sequence of being reborn into a new world, in which she must shed a previous skin and manifest herself into something else. The best part of this idea arrives in the form of when she saves the life of the film's lead male, and they joke afterwards that maybe the roles ought to have been reversed: she was the damsel in distress, and he should have saved her. Slither has its moments, but they're too few and far in between which is really saying something for a film with a runtime of ninety-five minutes.",Slither
42,GOWBTW,"A cross between ""Night of the Creeps"" and ""Night of the Living Dead""",7,8 June 2007,"This funny horror gives us a break from the usual. Plenty of scare factor, and tons of slapstick from keeping from being ordinary. Who would they would use 80's music to make the movie corny. If anyone remembers the 1986 movie ""Night of the Creeps"", this movie gives me a flashback. Set place in a small redneck town, this movie is not very typical. You got this couple who were supposed to go to this ""deer club"" and the night before, Mr. Grant(Michael Rooker), met the sister of a friend and suddenly he becomes a parasite victim. An ""Alien"" moment. This movie also reminds me of ""Night of the Living Dead"". Instead of brains, they got the thing for meat. Whether its in the store, out in the farm, or in the wild. And the entire town becomes engulf from the alien worms. These zombie wannabes spread terror, and wreak havoc on the innocents. This is hilarious, it's the biggest spoof of horror I've ever seen. Very funny!3 out of 5 stars!",Slither
43,kevin_robbins,This is a horror masterpiece that belongs in the hall of fame for this era,10,4 September 2021,"Slither (2006) is in my personal collection and I recently watched it again on Tubi. The storyline follows a unique alien invasion of sorts where leach like creatures latch onto you and fill you up with more leach like creatures. The humans eventually turn into deformed leaches themselves. The chances of a small town sheriff stopping the spread and the end of the world seems slim. This movie is directed by James Gunn (Guardians of the Galaxy) and stars Nathan Fillion (Firefly), Michael Rooker (Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer), Elizabeth Banks (The Hunger Games) and Gregg Henry (Payback). I first saw this at an independent screening months before it was released and thought it was awesome. The storyline for this is executed to perfection and contains brilliant special effects to facilitate the journey. The unique gore and correlated dialogue both gross you out and make you laugh at the same time. Rooker is absolutely awesome in this and his characters reminded me of his role in Mallrats. Henry as the mayor is also awesome and every scene with him and Rooker is gold. There's also two all time great horror scenes in this - the pregnant farm house scene and the tub scene. Both brilliantly depicted. Overall this is a horror masterpiece that belongs in the hall of fame for this era and is a 10/10 for me. I could watch this 100 times.",Slither
44,dee.reid,"Slippery and slimy, ""Slither"" slides into excellence",10,3 April 2006,"Now here is the horror genre at its most respectable: ""Slither,"" the feature debut of writer-director James ""Dawn of the Dead remake"" Gunn acknowledges its place as a piece of b-grade schlock reminiscent of Corman and the sci-fi/horror pictures from the '50s. More than that, some may be reminded of the film's all-too-familiar plot, which resembles ""Night of the Creeps"" (1986), a film that was also dedicated to the countless b-pictures that inspired it and shared a similar plot about alien parasites that turn their victims into ravenous zombies, as well as a slew of other similar-themed video nasties. But that's in the past.But does this at all make it bad? Heck no, but you should still expect ""Slither"" to be an absolute gross-out since Gunn lists Saturday-night fright flicks, David Cronenberg (specifically 1975's ""Shivers"" and 1986's ""The Fly""), Robert A. Heinlein's ""The Puppet Masters,"" Troma Entertainment (his former brethren), George A. Romero, the gory f/x-laden remakes of both ""The Blob"" (1988) and ""The Thing"" (1982), the ""Species"" series, Peter Jackson's early zombie movies, and the ""Evil Dead"" films amongst his inspirations.The movie opens with a shot of a meteorite falling to earth, inter-played with newly elected police chief Bill Pardy (Nathan Fillion) and his partner in their patrol car in a speed trap. Pardy's partner, who's playing with the radar gun by aiming at birds flying by, remarks about how he used to be able to tell the speed of a passing vehicle with his eyes. Just then the aforementioned meteor crashes down into the dense forest behind them, while they're completely oblivious, and that's the last we see of it for a while.""Slither"" introduces us to the simple townsfolk of Wheelsy (no state given, I don't think), a small hick town where the local sport of deer hunting is celebrated as a major event equal to the Fourth of July, and to kick off the fun and festivities the town's mayor Jack MacReady (Gregg Henry, his character's name an obvious reference to Kurt Russell's character from 1982's ""The Thing"") gives a huge speech. Gunn takes the opportunity to satirize small-town life and small-town folks. Keep in mind that while this is still billed as a horror movie, there are quite a few laughs arising from the setup.Horror movie fiends should have fun with picking out the consistent references to old-school b-grade schlock with the next set of events. Grant Grant (Michael ""Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer"" Rooker, who's got the misfortune of sharing the same first and last name), is the richest man in town, married to the prettiest woman in town, Starla (Elizabeth Banks). After a spat one night in bed, Grant storms out of the house and wastes his time getting drunk at the local.There he meets Brenda (Brenda James), and the two make the unwise decision of venturing out into the woods where they happen upon said meteorite. A la ""The Blob,"" Grant picks up a stick and pokes at a slithering mass of goop, which shoots something (a nasty ""Alien""-type critter?) into his chest. Grant is fine, somewhat, but he stumbles back to his home in a daze and with a taste for meat, which he then begins hording in his basement.When Starla gets curious as to the new padlock on the basement door, Grant says she shouldn't be asking so many questions since her birthday is approaching. Starla replies her birthday's not for two months; if she were a little more suspicious, she would ask him a smarter question than that, and investigate the cat and dog carcasses hanging from the ceiling like cows in a slaughterhouse.To make long stories short, Grant starts to mutate into a nasty squid monster, and has pulled poor Brenda (poor, poor Brenda) into his deadly web of infesting the town of Wheelsy. Faster than you can say, ""Good God, Marla, what nice tentacles you have!"" alien slugs are slithering down the streets, snacking on household pets, various farm animals, leaping into the throats of and transforming townspeople into zombies and other nasty mutations. So it becomes a race against time for Pardy, Starla (who Pardy secretly has the hots for), and others before Grant's offspring spreads beyond Wheelsy's borders.Anyone with half a brain (and at least a slight knowledge of b-grade horror movies) should know that cult classics cannot be ""made,"" they just happen over time. Sure, Gunn's ""Slither"" riffs a few of his uncanny inspirations, but he's paying homage to the very genre that created him and as many others.But there are plenty of jokes and in-jokes to keep things above water: the competency of the sheriff's department is called into question when a deputy suggests questioning witnesses on Grant's whereabouts using a dime-store toy octopus. (If anyone's seen Grant at night then a visual aid isn't necessary.) The school's curriculum should also come into question when Starla is first seen lecturing on Darwinism to her class; can she do that? And although there's no sex or nudity (at least in this cut of ""Slither""), there are some bizarre sexual references that women may find especially disturbing.I would imagine that like any fright flick before it, ""Slither"" isn't done with us yet. I have a feeling an unrated director's cut with extra slime and gore is on the way. But is it scary? Not really, but I would still keep the wee-ones away since as one character explains, it's ""Grooossss.""10/10",Slither

And yet this fusion of body horror and overplayed humour is very enjoyable. I say 'overplayed' - that is not strictly accurate. Only the monstrous are encouraged to 'heighten' their performances - the townsfolk are allowed to play things fairly straight.A small town is transformed into a zombie's paradise by an unspecified meteor landing. First to be affected is Grant (Michael Rooker), brutish husband of heroine Starla (Elizabeth Banks), who undergoes a gradual, hideous but deliberately ridiculous transformation into the hive-mind, whereby all future infected people share his mindset. Conveniently, this means that when (what has become of) Grant is destroyed, all the others are too. But there is a whole horror-show to get through before that even becomes a possibility.The numerous visual effects and their designers do an incredible job creating a convincing society descent into bloody chaos. Director and Writer James Gunn indulges his story with a growing sense of perversity - with truly appalling tragic moments accompanied by cheesy love songs which ensure we are never invited to take things seriously.",Slither
47,MBunge,I want my Mr. Pibb!,7,30 August 2010,"Slither is the 21st century resurrection of the monster-in-a-small-town films of the 1950s, and it does a better job than the little revival of the 1980s when then-modern special effects were slapped onto the genre with mixed results. Basically, if you liked the original Blob but weren't crazy about the remake, you'll like Slither.The very linear story sees a meteorite land in the woodsy town of Wheelsy just as deer season is about to begin. The alien worm from the meteorite jumps into a rich local named Grant Grant (Michael Rooker) and uses him to spread itself throughout the town. Among the group that ends up fighting the infestation is local police chief Bill Pardy (Nathan Fillion), Grant's wife Starla (Elizabeth Banks), the foul-mouthed and horny mayor of Wheelsy (Gregg Henry) and a teenage girl named Kylie (Tania Saulnier).The first thing is know about Slither is that while there's plenty of humor, it's not making fun of the monster-in-a-small-town genre nor is it trying to put some sort of postmodern, deconstructionist spin on the story. It's a pretty straight forward ""monster shows up, bad stuff happens, big fight at the end"" sort of film.The second thing to know is that while there's not a lot of genuine gore for this sort of movie, it is really disgusting. There aren't buckets of blood and truckloads of severed limbs, but there are a lot of really gross physical mutations on display. If skin that looks like old cottage cheese trips your trigger, Slither is a must-watch. There's also plenty of mutilated animal corpses and it even includes zombies, so I guess there's something for the whole family.The special effects are very good but what really distinguishes Slither are the actors' performances. Tania Saulnier as Kylie is a fairly generic pretty girl role, but most of the other characters have a little bit more to them and the actors do a great job playing up those little nuances. Michael Rooker and Elizabeth Banks do a very nice job creating a believable older husband/younger wife dynamic and Nathan Fillion brings a blunt charm to the police chief who's been pining over Starla since they were kids.What ultimately makes Slither a good film is writer/director James Gunn's sense of restraint, which is not a quality usually associated with tentacle-sprouting, slug-spawning, flesh-munching movies like this. Specifically Gunn treats the pseudo-love triangle at the heart of the story with a very realistic touch. Instead of portraying Grant as this mean, controlling jerk who thinks he owns Starla, we get to see him as an uncultured and somewhat jealous but basically decent guy who really loves his young wife. Instead of Starla being a woman trapped in a loveless prison, she has a lot of affection for Grant but is just not completely satisfied by her life. Instead of throwing Bill and Starla into some Jiffy Pop romantic cliché where they suddenly realize after all these years how much they love each other, we see sparks of attraction between them which can't really flare up because they're trying to keep alien slugs from burrowing into their brains.Sometimes the best way to characterize a film is to say, ""You'll like it if you like that sort of thing"". If you like acid spitting, a tough chick with a fence post, a mutant deer, fleshy tentacles and somebody throwing an hysterical fit when there's no more Mr. PibbSlither is the movie for you.",Slither
48,CubsandCulture,"Just your standard issue alien invasion-zombie-feminist critique of marriage movie. Wait, what?",10,1 April 2019,"James Gunn would later find mainstream success with his Guardians of Galaxy films but I will always think of him as the director of this film. it is one of my favorite films from the naughts and I still don't quite know why it didn't take off culturally. It is a blend of several horror templates that should please gorefans with its quick pace, funny gags and it's general subversive attitude. The zombie trope of ""please kill me"" is present in a very blunt way for example. Bill Pardy (Fillion) is a great doofus to hang the humor on. Grant Grant makes for a tragic villain and Starla (Banks) is wonderfully realized character.The film is really interesting to return too and I think fans of the Guardian movies should. You see a lot of the bones of the Gunn's career in this film. He has a really great skill of finding the perfect union of story moment, song and theme. This film doesn't quite have the extensive odd (but perfect) scoring of the his later films but the use of ""Every Woman in the World"" by Air Supply is classic Gunn on this point. Likewise, Gunn's ability to fulfill while undermining genre tropes is in display here. It really is just a funny, creepy horror film.The film isn't deep-it is mostly a genre piece and homage-but if one is inclined there *are* themes of male entitlement, commodification of the woman's bodies, and the male gaze that are developed in the film. Nothing on that point is really original but it is there and makes the film richer.I just love this lost gem.",Slither
49,NateWatchesCoolMovies,a splatter fest and then some,8,4 December 2016,"Slimy, icky, yucky and gooey don't even begin to cover James Gunn's Slither, a corrosively funny low budget schlock-fest that took the genre by storm a decade ago, charmed horror fans all over and put him squarely on the map. A throwback to many mindless low budget creature features of yore, but still with enough brains in its head (and some splattering the wall) to have decently written characters and a monster that doesn't feel lame or copied and pasted. When a strange asteroid lands in the forests outside small town USA, it's only a matter of time before someone stumbles across whatever it contains and becomes infected. That someone happens to be Michael Rooker, here playing the deftly named Grant Grant, local bigwig and proud husband to trophy wife Elizabeth Banks. There's a deadly parasite with the rock, one that takes him over, turns him into a giant disgusting inbred octopus, and has apocalyptic plans for our planet. Nathan Fillion, who is in literally every Gunn film, does a sly and charming turn as the local Sheriff, never losing his cool long enough to let up with the attitude, and backed up by his trusty deputy (the lovely Jennifer Copping). Gregg Henry, another Gunn veteran, steals the show as the town's sleazy, foul mouthed mayor who laments ""I've never seen anything like this before, and I watch Animal Planet all the fuc*%$in time!!!"". Rooker is a champ for sitting through all the makeup, as most of his scenes are him whipping around tentacles that chop people up and covered in a deluge of slimy deformations. There's slug like parasites that'll make you suirm (careful getting in that bathtub), morbid obesity to hilarious lengths, gore galore and a tongue in cheek attitude that's irresistible.

50,drownnnsoda,"Tongue-In-Cheek Humor, Squeamish Scares.",8,12 June 2007,"In the style of cheap retro alien horror movies, ""Slither"" centers around a small Southern town. One night, a meteor lands in the woods, and a man named Grant Grant, ends up stumbling upon it and has a strange alien shard shot into his body. His friendly wife, a Southern débutante named Starla, becomes suspicious after Grant begins to become increasingly ill, and begins to kill the town animals and feeds off of them. Soon after, a plague of alien slug-like creatures begin to take over the town, using the residents as hosts and turning them into zombies, with Grant as the king of them all. Now it's up to Starla and the local, measly police force to stop the epidemic before it spreads any farther.To put it plainly, science fiction isn't my cup of tea - books, movies, anything - I've just never really cared for it. But to my surprise, this was a highly entertaining, funny, and grotesque little throwback to 1950s alien take-over movies. The story lacks most originality, it is mainly a compilation of assorted elements from these type of sci-fi alien horror films, all thrown in a blender and mixed around, with some sufficient humor tossed in as well. The script still manages to be consistent and nicely put together. There's some plot holes and a few minor problems, but considering the type of movie this is, it doesn't even matter. The dialog flows well, the pacing is right, and there are some wonderfully-executed sequences with the alien species and the townspeople desperate to save their lives. The humor is dark but often quite obvious, and I was laughing quite a bit. This film is a good example of a horror/comedy hybrid that turns out positively.As for the aliens themselves, CGI makes up most of them, but there are also some stunning makeup effects on display as well, these can be seen on the Grant character after he's been transformed and mutated into a giant blob of alien matter. The aliens' manner of taking over a human is quite simple as well - they enter through the mouth, and implant themselves into the brain - here's the catch - they're all a part of Grant, the ""king"" so to speak, so they are essentially him in different bodies. Interesting premise, I thought, and it makes way for a lot of squeamish gore and a few good scares throughout the film. The acting wasn't bad either, good performance from Elizabeth Banks as the leading heroine, Nathan Fillion as a police chief, and Tania Saulnier as a teenage girl caught up in the alien attack.Overall, ""Slither"" is a delightfully funny and squeamishly scary little alien monster movie that is guaranteed to entertain you if nothing else. Good overall story, great laughs, and some grotesque alien gore make this an enjoyable movie. I'm not even really into the entire science-fiction aspect of horror flicks, but I had a really good time with this one, if that tells you anything. Recommended to fans of alien and/or monster-themed horror movies, or anyone who would enjoy a brainless and funny splatter flick. 8/10.",Slither

But it's up to a dedicated sheriff (Nathon Fillon), Grant's pretty wife (Elizabeth Banks), a teenager (Tania Saulnier) and the mayor (Gregg Herny) to stop the Grant Monster before it spreads all over the world.Written and Directed by James Gunn (Screenwriter of ""Scooby Doo"", ""Scooby Doo 2:Monsters Unleashed"" and the 2004 remake of ""Dawn of the Dead"") made an genuinely gross-out Sci-Fi/Horror/Comedy film. That was sadly an box office disappointment. When it was released in the spring of 2006, despite good reviews by critics. But it grew to be an Cult Favorite on DVD. Gunn's clever script has many insightful references to vintage horror films and to filmmakers like John Carpenter and David Cronenberg. This has excellent make-up effects by Todd Masters and his F/X team.DVD has an fine anamorphic Widescreen (1.78:1) transfer and an good-Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound.

Being that I don't typically enjoy American-made theatrical horror films, I was pretty blasé about going as I reluctantly agreed. But I gotta say that SLITHER really was pretty decent.An alien life form comes to earth in the form of some sluggy looking things and jumps into peoples mouths and ""possesses"" them - turning them into zombie-ish sorta things...That's pretty much all there is to it, but it's the way that the subject matter is handled that makes this one refreshing. SLITHER is genuinely hilarious throughout, with out feeling ""forced"", or ""cheap"" in it's laughs. Some really classic lines and decent performances raise this one above the typical crap that you usually see at the theater these days. Tons of references to other horror films (see if you can spot 'em all...) but still ""original"" in it's own way. Not a perfect film - but definitely the kind of thing the U.S. horror market could use more of. Worth a look - 7/10",Slither

If any were missed, it was only because of the time element.It keeps in line with the censorship policy of the sci-fi channel of neo-Nazi propaganda, making movies for American women, most of whom are blond, by perpetuating the myth that men prefer blonds, even though only about one out of ten do, though nine out of ten dare not admit it to women, who rely on the myth for control. It's just easy to be blond. Most people can do it just by hours in sunlight.Here, we have a creature who prefers a blond, and the whole movie is generated around this brainwashing scheme to make us think it is an animal's nature, when it is exactly the opposite in the animal world.That's bad enough, and contrived enough, but the contrived script goes so far as to make sure no one in an entire town survives a horror ordeal except a few principles. That's so contrived that only a moron can't be bored by it.Why is it not 1/10? The actors seem to enjoy it, and looked like they had fun, and did their job well. There are a few things that aren't exactly in line with the horror formula. Not many, but a few.Still, it's a movie that probably only women will enjoy, and the only men who watch it are those who do so for a project, or to critique it, or to please the women in the group. It's not enjoyable at all for guys. And the women probably won't like the idea that a brunette gets to survive in the end along with the blond.",Slither
56,fertilecelluloid,"Well made, low key, predictable and squishy horror flick for kids",5,1 April 2006,"This is an inoffensive, well made, tongue-in-cheek horror film from ex-Troma boy James Gunn. Melvin the Mop Boy gets a look-in on a TV screen, Henenlotter (Frank) gets a mention, there is a John Carpenter look-alike, a Wes Craven look-alike (maybe intentional, maybe not), and the premise is stock 50's sci-fi. Twelve year old boys will love it, and Fangoria will praise its squishy virtues, but hardcore horror fans will be a little bored. There's nothing terribly wrong with it, and the gore effects are nicely presented, but there is a numbing predictability about it and a low key approach that generates a low key response. Michael Rooker, who came to infamy with ""Henry Portrait of a Serial Killer"", plays the somewhat older husband of a young schoolteacher, who gets invaded by a slimy critter (ala ""The Hidden"") and proceeds to rampage across the countryside in search of raw meat and his frightened wife. It is not surprising that Henenlotter, the director of ""Basket Case"" and ""Brain Damage"", is referenced because Rooker starts resembling ""Basket Case's"" deformed twin Belial once things go South for his characer. Opportunities to pay homage to films such as ""Squirm"" and ""Shivers"" abound, and all is wrapped up neatly. In the acting stakes, only Greg Henry, who has made a memorable career for himself playing slimeballs in ""Payback"" and ""Body Double"", manages to scratch an identifiable signature on the celluloid. PG-13 would have been a more appropriate rating. There is nothing Adult here. ""Slither"" is a sticky Goosebumps.",Slither
57,aidanratesmovies,Overrated and honestly pretty dull,4,10 September 2021,"Although it does have some interesting elements and manages to be somewhat entertaining- Slither ultimately feels too dragged out and too cobbled together to be any fun- and at times can be a bit of a chore to watch. I was disappointed about this film. I knew it wouldn't be anything great, but I was hoping to have fun with it and enjoy myself. Sadly it just feels like a dud, I like some of the films ideas, but the way it executes them is so mechanical that it's just rather unpleasant to watch. It just feels dull, and it's sad to see such a unique premise go wasted like that, but sadly that's all it takes to num the film down to the bone and prove to be a rather forgettable time. The acting is rather mediocre, all the performers either trying too hard, trying too little, or simply just miscast. Tania Saulnier seems to be the only one trying, and honestly is hardly in the film, so it doesn't make much of a difference. The special effects are rather impressive, especially considering the time- and I admire writer/director James Gunn's image to body horror of the past with practical effects being used as well- but some gruesome images- as elaborate as they are- just don't make for a compelling film. In the end, I admire Slither's premise and what it was trying to do- but too many parts mumbled together make for a rather dull and drawn out flick that is as forgettable as it is just plain gross.My Rating: 4.4/10.",Slither
58,Jonny_Numb,Dreamcatcher Slugs in Tromaville,5,27 November 2006,"It is really too bad that ""Slither"" isn't a better movie. After writing the successful, pull-no-punches remake of ""Dawn of the Dead,"" I had fair expectations for James Gunn's directorial debut. What he delivered was a completely forgettable (seriously, most of the film had 'slithered' out of my head before the credits were done rolling) sci-fi/horror hybrid, pulling elements from ""Dreamcatcher,"" ""Slugs,"" ""The Thing,"" ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers,"" ""Shivers,"" and a segment of ""Creepshow."" Well...at least his sources were on the right track. ""Slither"" is a glossy, CGI-heavy monstrosity involving a meteor that crashes to Earth, unleashing a parasite on poor, lecherous Grant Grant (Michael Rooker), who proceeds to impregnate a woman, after which she, um, 'gives birth' to millions of fast-moving, slug-like creatures; soon the entire town is reduced to a gaggle of infected zombies, and only Grant's wife (Elizabeth Banks, from ""The 40-Year Old Virgin""), the Chief of Police (Nathan Fillion), and yes, The Mayor (Gregg Henry, whose over-the-top performance is the best thing about the film) can save the day. Gunn seems to have written and directed this as a Sam Raimi-style sendup, but he's simply not skilled enough to pull it off--the comedy is mostly forced, 'dumb redneck' stuff, and the film just isn't scary or suspenseful. I'll give ""Slither"" credit for defying the current trend of 'torture porn,' and being a relatively competent directorial debut...I just wish Gunn hadn't gone back to Tromaville for his material.",Slither

60,Samiam3,"Gooey, Goofy, fun",7,15 September 2009,"It's The Blob meets Shivers, with a touch of Tremors and Lake Placid, tongue in cheek. The result is a surprisingly tasty formula. The ability to laugh at one's self is the different between fun camp and crappy camp. Slither is definitely the former.A meteor is coming down to Earth. Like most, the majority of it burns up in the atmosphere but a tiny fragment makes it through. It lands in the forest near the town of Weelsy, (Alabama I think) Inside is a parasite, seemingly harmless but all it needs to become the most lethal organism on the planet is a host. One night after having too much to drink a big fella called G becomes the lucky finder, upon inspection he is infected. One thing leads to another, and before long there are hundreds of parasites roaming the town searching for hosts. Assisted by G's lovely wife, the Sheriff's department sets out on a bug hunt, but it soon becomes a game of survival.The humour is essential part of Slither. You can tell that the movie is intentionally funny because you laugh when you are supposed to. For example, one scene ends with a mother tucking her girls into bed. She whispers""don't let the bed bugs bite"" and the next thing we see is a parasite crawling up the house toward the window. I think the make-up team deserves a big hand. This is a pretty gross movie, The last half hour gives up lots of bile, flesh and slime not to mention tentacles which look like whale intestines and warts the size of Tennis balls.Films like Slither come out all the time, most of them are dismissible, but a few deliver what we expect when we try. this is one of them, enough to be worth your time on a rainy Friday night.",Slither
61,onepotato2,"gross-out, sexualized horror",1,4 February 2007,"This got good reviews that suggested it was tongue-in-cheek fun. I had a few laughs, but this slimy invader thing is not only old, it's oversexualized. I don't understand why those agitated by porn films, with their spilling of fluids, throbbing flesh etc, are so neutral and quiet about movies that otherwise cover the same ground under the guise of ""horror."" Alien, Strange Invaders, Species, etc, all of them feature phallus-like organisms that try to penetrate people (accompanied by copious amounts of slime) in a predatory attempt to reproduce. So conceptually, your kids have already seen a horror movie at least as grotesque and dirty as the dirtiest porn flick. In this one, a guy trying to have a roll in the hay with a gal opens a void in her chest and thrusts two tentacles inside... then he shakes and quivers. She does too.Mmmm... wholesome & violent! A culture so uptight that it finds a way to substitute the actual grotesque machinery of alien reproduction for the supposed obcenity of the machinery of actual sex. Why is alien sex okay for kids to view?Fear Factor is another borderline example; in which people have to, say, drink a horse-penis milkshake, etc. This crap is only a shade away from the ""obscenity"" of actual sex. I'd say this is more troubling, because sex occurs naturally; you'd have to be more deviant to come up with a horse-penis milkshake, than to be interested in sex. But meathead Joe Rogan comes right into your living room without a squeak from the population. It's bizarre. You can never anticipate what America will morally flip-out over.

62,nycritic,Sliding into Rollicking Fun,9,4 April 2006,"Because it can't always be about the critically acclaimed, the existential European dramas, or ground-breaking indie films, SLITHER is great entertainment and worth the price of admission. Is the story new? For that reason, is the sky underneath our feet and the ocean hanging over our heads? But even then, the concept of a vicious alien race that has decided to take root in our planet is not a new one. I could list a score of films in this respect, beginning from THE BLOB, THE THING, SQUIRM, or INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS, but that would be saying that a vampire movie made today has a reference to earlier vampire movies featuring the ubiquitous Dracula. Anyone who has seen enough horror can catch even slight little references to THE SHINING and ROSEMARY'S BABY. However, this is not a rip-off: James Gunn brings his own style into SLITHER and features some pretty snappy effects featuring poor Michael Rooker's progressive transformation from a buff, shaved stud who wouldn't be out of place in a leather bar to a mass of writhing tentacles incorporating every other human in its path, beckoning even then to his wife Stella, to fulfil her marital duties even when it may not seem all that pleasurable to her. Good performances on the B-movie level from pretty much everyone, a tight story that Stephen King could have written in his sleep (indeed, there are even more references to him than anyone), and some unpredictable moments make this one of the better entries that should spawn a slithering mass of horror purists who will make this their newest cult in a long line of cult movies.",Slither
63,lemon_magic,A minor horror classic that deserves wider exposure,7,24 November 2007,"I have a friend who is a big fan of Nathan Fillion (the likable lead actor in ""Slither"") from Nathan's ""Firefly"" days, and he (my friend that is) insisted that I watch this film (since he knows I enjoy looking for overlooked classics and ""diamonds-in-the-rough""). It turned out to be a really fun time. The title ""Slither"" is perhaps a bit misleading and may have cost the movie part of its potential audience, since it isn't an ""animals on the attack"" horror movie about snakes, but rather, a nice blend of horror, comedy and science fiction elements with a plot about a ""hive mind"" that invades a small town via telepathic slugs. I know, it doesn't sound all that promising, but the film makers work very hard to get all the elements right, and the result will be a blast to any fan of horror movies who doesn't mind a little comedy in his adrenaline. As my friend astutely commented about the cast in ""Slither"", ""There isn't a flat tire in the bunch."" Casting and acting are nicely appropriate to the subject matter.I certainly have a new respect for Micheal Rooker, a decent actor with a penchant for appearing in slick,overheated mainstream thrillers like ""Cliffhanger"" and ""Gone in 60 Seconds"", but who plays against type here as the main ""infectee"". But the real joy of the film is Nathan Fillion. The guy is just a pleasure to watch on screen. He's one of these actors who is so good that you may not realize how good he actually is, because he makes what he does look effortless. He can play funny, smart, perceptive, vulnerable, tough and scared silly, all extremely well, AND he plays well with other actors. The writing is very nice here. The screenplay takes the time to get the pathos and humanity of the small town residents and their web of relationships right before it brings in the monster...and the monster itself is portrayed in an intriguing way. I liked ""Slither"" a lot. Good solid effort that I wish I had known more about when it first came out so I could have supported it in the theaters. But I'll vote with my DVD dollars and get a copy soon. If you enjoy intelligent, well made, small scale horror films, you should see it too.",Slither

One of those unlucky people gets hit with a barb and becomes very sick. Little does the town know that those who are infected with this unknown virus turn into an alien zombie. Just when things couldn't get any worse, thousands upon thousands of alien slugs terrorize the town and the only way for it to take over the boy is through the mouth.Slither, written and directed by James Gunn, takes the best parts of every B movie and adds its own special flare. What we get is one of the years funniest films. If you're comedic horror films such as: Idle Hands, Eight Legged Freaks, Undead, Shaun of the Dead, etc, then you will no doubt love this film. The moments where Undead and Eight Legged Freaks failed, Slither passes with flying colours. While the spider flick was indeed good cheesy fun, it wasn't all that funny and Undead had no idea which direction it wanted to go in, Slither balances all of this perfectly. Compared to Undead, Slither looks very similar. Both have one or two individuals from a small town police force with the heroes, involve zombies and aliens, has gross out gore and comedy. Slither just manages to do all these things ten times better then Undead ever did. Slither stands out among all the other horror comedies because it balances everything extremely well. Whether it's exploding heads, green acid spit, or naked girls in bathtubs, Slither has something to offer for everyone.The entire cast work perfectly together, Fillion and Banks play off each other extremely well, as does Bank and slowly becoming one of them husband, Rooker. Each of these individuals pulls their own weight and are hilarious. You can see how much gun they are having on set and the film emits all of this. Gregg Henry, Jenna Fischer (from The Office fame) and Tania Saulnier round out the rest of the funny cast and all do very well. Henry stands out of the group as the a-hole Mayor, who is terrified at every turn.The CGI isn't all too great, because they're slugs for crying out loud, but the make-up effects is where the film shines. Seeing the really, really obese character who is constantly eating brought me back to the b horror movie make up days, which is exactly what this film is trying to convey. The zombie effects are well done for the budget of the film and the gross out humour is spot on.Slither is a film made by a horror fan, for horror fans. It won't shock or scare you, but make you appreciate the old fashioned horror films. It takes that old formula and whips it into a new style. It's tongue in cheek horror that isn't afraid to poke fun at itself, which is why it's so enjoyable. Slither is a perfect drive in theatre type of flick that you would go to; to simply be entertained and have some popcorn. It doesn't rip off any movies because it doesn't take itself seriously enough to do so.Slither is a film that knows its audience, so it knows exactly how to please them. Watching the film, you'll be see many inside horror reference and where most of its inspiration came from. You get a sense of Tremors and Invasion of the Body Snatchers, not to mention hundreds of other horror films. The bottom line is that this is a slimy, gooey, goofy, horror film that will have you laughing all throughout. This is a definite watch for fans of the genre.

But the film has the common sense to basically stick to 4 main characters, and one of those is dragged into the action half way through.Bill Pardy (Nathan Fillion) is the Sheriff of the sleep town, a young man who has progressed rapidly, perhaps due to the ineptness and unreadiness of those under his command who we meet through the film. Bill holds a rather large candle for Starla (Elizabeth Banks), whom he grew up with. Starla is a beautiful young teacher who grew up poor and apparently latched on to the first wealthy guy she met, who happens to be Grant Grant (yes X2), played by Michael Rooker. We never work out what he is supposed to do but he is an independently wealthy man who is a little perturbed by the lack of reciprocity from his trophy wife at his repeated advances. Put more simply the bedroom side of the marriage has lost momentum.One such refusal sets Grant Grant (GG from here) off into the night in search of alcohol fuelled relief, when more tangible ""relief"" arrives in the form of a young bar slut woman, and in a backwoods stumble he and the skank come across our buddy the space rock from the first paragraph. As another crappy film I watched recently said ""I love it when a script comes together"", or something similar. The rock held a cow tongue sized wormy looking thing that promptly leaps somehow and affixes itself to GG's chest and embeds itself in its new ""host"".To this point the film was frequently funny and had already introduced likable characters spouting snappy and often quotable dialogue. From here on in the absurdity factor kicks in, and Slither is basically equally hilarious and awe-inspiring from here on in.GG seems a little ""off"" after his late night trip to the woods.Upon his return to his marital home he becomes quite secretive, going as far as creating some sort of den in the newly locked basement. He also begins to crave meat, nothing wrong with that of course, but suffice to say he isn't too discerning about the source.After the annual opening of the Deer hunting Season where Bill and Starla have a brief chat that proves both are aware of the urges, but that such a union is impossible, Starla heads home where she finds GG nowhere to be seen..All the while GG and the creature had been battling for control of GG's body, and it appears that GG lost. What follows is one of the weirder ""love"" scenes in cinematic history since Sylvester Stallone and Sharon Stone got it on over a decade ago. When GG heads home and finds that Starla has lost the desire for his ""chest tubes"" (yeah I said it and you read it) the GG creature goes on the lam.Confused as to what might cause a grown man to spout tentacles and eat stray dogs Bill and the police force set up a sting to find and catch him, as word arrives that GG is preying on local livestock. Starla tags along, as does the local foul mouthed sleazy mayor, (who provides further comic relief along the way, mainly through his disbelief and reactions).The hunt leads the crew to a barn in the middle of nowhere, the barn houses GG's ""special lady"", who is swollen and ready to ""drop"". When she does almost on cue all sh*t breaks loose. GG's ""babies"" start possessing any and all locals, human or otherwise, including very nearly a young girl named Kylie, who informs all and sundry that all worms and their hosts are controlled by one superbeing from another planet, and that they are all working towards one goal. (The goal is similar to that of Genghis Khan some time back, and all he only wanted to control was the entire world.) So the remainder of the film has Bill, Starla and Kylie trying to decide whether to escape or fight, all this changes once Starla is takenThe film is hilarious even before the insane makeup and creatures are introduced (GG's pregnant girl needs to be seen to be believed, as does the ""birth""), and only gets funnier as the film progresses. There is some effective OTT gore that is intended to disgust in a funny way, not for scares, and the finale tops everything off as Bill goes mano-a-whatever-o versus Grant Grant and his ever growing conglomeration of random flesh.Fillion proves he is naturally funny and likable. I want him to be cast in more films soon as a result of this.Elizabeth Banks proves that she is not only hot but she'll do anything - kinda like Eastern European ""models"" - only she does it for laughs and not a roof and porn career.It was said previously but the film is chock full of small roles that due to the quality of the character actors actually add to the film, especially the Mayor.Final Rating – 8.5 / 10.

Gunn fortunately keeps the CGI to a minimum, at least until the very end, and even then he appears to make far more use of physical prosthetics and animatronics. The king creature at the climax is right out of JOHN CARPENTER'S THE THING, a big, fleshy thing with horrible features and flailing arms -- and which appears to be mostly a physical construct rather than a cartoon.

I'm still going with Evil Dead on that one, Slither wasn't quite up to the level.The funniest 'horror' film of late was actually a 'zombie' film - Sean of the Dead - and I laughed all the way through the film. What worked? The actors, the timing, the music, the zombies...the outcome. Slither was promoted as a horror/gore/scare fest with black humor and I thought would have some of the same elements as Sean of the Dead, what I got was a so-so film that had a few light chuckles and no horror, no gore and some unscripted silliness and a sorry ending.It started off fine, then fell into plot hole hell. The monster wasn't gross enough (kinda reminded me of a cheaper ripped off version of the monster from the better 80's film ""From Beyond""), the impregnated lady was kinda fun but not funny enough, but most importantly: not enough 'slither'. While watching the film I got the feeling that the filmmakers wanted to go all out and let go - but chickened out - maybe because of budget, maybe because of ideas - regardless, I didn't care.The acting was okay, but some of the folks didn't have enough to act with. Greg Henry is always good to have in your film. In this film, he didn't do much, but the few seconds here and there he spent on camera were fun. Same with the monster (Grant), not enough of him or about the monster (didn't like how that was explained too quickly). Too darned much of Starla and not of Brenda and of Bill.A so-so light weight thriller, light weight horror, very little laughs, and a light weight familiar story.",Slither
74,gedikreverdi,Grant the arch-alien zombie,7,10 December 2020,"From a meteor fell into their town grant was poked by the alien seed and possesed by it as it is placed in his brain. He started to become a giant powerful squid with lesions and disfiguration. He started to crave for meat and made a slaughterhouse of animals in his basement to quench his meat cravings. And then he Kidnapped Brenda and transformed her too and the thing she has turned into was a giant blob of a meat in the cabin in the forest. She exploded in front of the police officer billy, Starla the grants wife, Kylie who was attacked in the bathroom tub and her whole family turned into zombies and others. As she exploded, the fast moving slugs spread all around and started to enter into their bodies thru their mouths. And they spit acid to bloat and explode you. All the people turned into zombies was orchestrated by grant and he can speak thru them and they can all feel and see the same things. After they had an accident, they captured Starla and brought her to her house for grant and all the others were there eating ravenously like the mayor out of the 90s eating flesh like the others and begged to be shot to the police officer bill and his wish was granted. The extremely giant blob of an alien zombie grant was there and the most grotesque scene was the way how alien zombie were becoming a part of the giant blob of grant. Starla approached him and tried to kill it with the brush and bill threw the hand grande but he dodged it and it exploded in the pool and then he attached a gas tank in one of his tentacles and she shot him. He and everyone attached to him exploded. Bill survived wounded with kylie and Starla. And after the credits there was a cat bitten by the seed just like grant was. This movie deserved a sequel. It was very fun to watch and there was a pleasant retro vibe to it.",Slither
75,ElijahCSkuggs,Fun Slimy Stuff,9,25 October 2006,"I was waiting for this movie to come out for a while. First day it hit the big screen I was right there. I knew exactly what to expect and it was exactly what I thought it was gonna be. A fun, slimy, throw back comedy/horror flick. I recently bought the DVD, and watched it last night....still fun slimy stuff. I gave it a 9, but it's more around an 8 1/2.Story is about a meteorite crash landing on Earth where a local man is infected by the meteorite riding alien. The alien and the character Grant are now sharing his body....alien controlling about 90% of the character. He eventually starts transforming into what this alien species looks like which is a slimy, muscley, squid monster. By the way, it's awesome make-up effects. Grant's face kind of looks like Ricky Coogin's from Freaked a little later on. Anyways, Alien Grant is now in a survival/conquer mode and with the help of his alien slug army, the only hope left is Jack Sh!t. And Jack left town. The leading characters are now on a mission to save their own lives, while trying to stop this alien rampage.The movie itself is a blast. You have great special effects, silly characters who are actually portrayed well....good acting, tons of horror movie nods, fine directing. It is a labor of love, that most horror fans should really dig. I'm a huge fan of Slither and I pray more films like this are on their way.",Slither
76,jaredmobarak,She packs a boxed lunchSlither,6,14 April 2007,"I think I might enjoy the comedy/horror genre more than the actual horror films they parody. James Gunn, (yes, the man who brought us what I can only imagine are fantastic scripts for Scooby Doo 1 & 2not sure since I would never watch them), has broken into the mix with his film Slither. It appears he understands the appeal these films have and jam-packs it with gore, camp, and humor. The audience can never wonder if what transpires is unintentionally funny because they are too busy thinking about the parts that are unintentionally scary. A comedy, through and through, Gunn gathers a nice group of actors to play up the cheese yet still make us believe they are smack in the middle of the otherworldly situation they are in.The basic premise here is that an alien life formnot Martians as they are from Mars of coursehas come to Earth to make it its next world for consumption. Our villain inhabits a local and makes him go out to either infect, impregnate, or devour all other forms of meat, human or otherwise, along his journey. This host just happens to be involved in a somewhat loveless marriage with the resident good-looking teacher, who or course is the object of our hero's affection, the chief of police. Once the creature's first mate unleashes his spawn of collective-consciousness worms, the town comes under attack and only the chief, the host's wife, and the obnoxious mayor can save the day.Amidst all the zombie-turning and the blood, acid spit, and limb jellying, we are treated with some great laughs and one-liners from people who truly know how to deliver the script deadpan for added effectiveness. The great Michael Rooker plays the host body to campy perfection. What role of his hasn't oozed tongue-in-cheek outbursts and over-the-top facial expressions? Gregg Henry takes the unpolished politician to new heights and everything he says gets a laugh as result. Even his introduction in the film, swearing in the midst of his constituents and their children, is a tired gimmick, but still effectively funny. As for our real heroes, we are treated to some good forbidden chemistry between Nathan Fillion and Elizabeth Banks. Fillion is king of sarcasm and always stays in a realistic mode unfazed by the horrors happening around him. Someone else could have allowed the film to become unhinged if they didn't take this role seriously; the comedy relies on this character not seeing the humor around him. With Banks, a favorite of mine who is underused in movies, I was not a big fan of the fake accent, but I guess it does fit the aesthetic of what is going on. And as the mayor says, she is hardcorewhen she kills her first infected assailant, it's priceless.Definitely more entertaining than expected, I can still understand the lack of love at the box office. The trailers showed that there would be some subversion to the horror with humor, but didn't quite go all the way with it. I'm sure people were confused in what to expect and those who wanted scares were disappointed as were those that wanted pure laughs. To me, Gunn masterfully mixes the two just right for an enjoyable ride in Hicksville, USA during an interstellar battle for supremacy. He gets all the little moments right, the grenade folly, the corny love scene music, and even the extras looking like they are from a backwoods/ incestuous town. The look was right and the delivery just as effective as I laughed pretty much straight through.",Slither

78,MrGKB,80s throwback worms its way into your heart...,6,20 April 2007,"...by way of some impressive fx work and a script that works far more effectively than writer/director James ""Scooby Doo"" Gunn's reworking of ""Dawn of the Dead."" ""Slither"" doesn't pretend to be anything more than what it is, a tongue-in-cheek popcorn flick, and that's all to its advantage. Gunn stuffs his alien invasion movie full of references and homages to everything from David Cronenberg's ""Rabid"" to John Carpenter's ""The Thing"" and Brian Yuzna's ""Society,"" and it all seems to work, at least on the surface. A very solid cast, headed up by Nathan ""Serenity"" Fillion, Elizabeth ""Spider-Man"" Banks, Michael ""Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer"" Rooker, and Gregg ""Body Double"" Henry, makes the difference with performances that complement, and yet transcend, the pulpiness of the story.Said story is a standard riff on alien infestation, with a specific concentration on the ickiness of tentacular rape and parasitic subjugation. Sight gags (if you'll pardon the pun) abound: a man bifurcated by a whipsawing alien appendage, a woman stuffed to the gills (and then some!) with alien tadpoles, a young woman (and others) orally invaded by mobile alien phalli, and so on and so forth. Production values are remarkably high for such a relatively cheap film, and it's obvious that everyone involved had a good time making it. Still, there's little in ""Slither"" that you haven't seen elsewhere, and unfortunately there's nothing to really set it apart from the films to which it pays homage, thus rendering it little more than disposable entertainment, in one eye and out the other. I'm glad I found it at the library free of charge, and I doubt it'll become a part of my DVD library until I can find it dirt cheap.Still, it's a tolerable timekiller, and worth a watch to any and all fans of the genre.",Slither
79,fwomp,Dawn of the Dead Meets Invasion of the Body Snatchers,7,3 November 2006,"Feels something slimy crawling up your back? Don't scream! It wants to get into your mouth and take over your body. These reddish slug-like creatures crash landed in a small grove near a hick town in the U.S. and, unfortunately, Chief of Police Bill Pardy (Nathan Fillion, SERENITY) didn't notice right away. The meteorite carrying these interstellar parasites lands right behind his police car one night. Bill Pardy is too occupied with his infatuation for Starla (Elizabeth Banks, THE 40 YEAR OLD VIRGIN), a woman now married to a wealthy townsman named Grant (Michael Rooker, DAYS OF THUNDER). Pardy pines away for Starla, but he's soon forced to deal with something far more important: saving the Earth. Starla's husband, Grant, is ""infected"" by the first of these creatures and begins changing both mentally and physically. He needs meat. Any kind of meat. Dog. Possum. Cow. Human. He must grow. And he does grow ...into a hideous human-slug hybrid that has to find a mate that'll give birth to thousands more of the slug invaders. He finally meets up with an unfortunate soul and ""impregnates"" her then locks her away in a barn, feeding her local varments and making her grow to unheard of pregnant proportions. Once Grant's impregnated human ""pops"", the slugs rapidly travel through the countryside, looking for humans. Once they catch up with them, the slugs enter through their mouths and take over the human host, thus turning them into a sort of zombie starving for meat. Bill Pardy must destroy the main creature, Grant, before he's able to take over the entire town. All of the little slugs are now a smaller piece of Grant's consciousness and he sees whatever one of his little sluggers sees, giving him millions of eyes and perspectives. That James Gunn (screenwriter for DAWN OF THE DEAD, 2004) did SLITHER is no big surprise. His zombie-esquire, interstellar, slug-infested hometown citizens ring familiar with a sort of INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS theme. Nathan Fillion does an outstanding job as the calm yet determined police chief. That he delivers some excellent comedic lines in the midst of terrible events only added an extra punch to the story (""We'll just say that I saved you instead of the other way around, okay?"")Special gore effects are carried out perfectly by Joe Colwell as we see Michael Rooker go through his disgusting transformation, and watch the slugs forcibly enter a multitude of mouths. Gross!The one major flaw with the film is that it simply isn't that original. Parallels to the aforementioned Invasion of the Body Snatchers and Dawn of the Dead are easily apparent. But the characters are excellent and the script strong. Fierce dialogue mixed with dark humor keep the story moving at a great pace (the entire film is only 95 minutes). Slither is frightfully fun. For those who enjoyed SHAUN OF THE DEAD, you might want to check out this flick.",Slither
80,cultfilmfan,Slither,7,8 April 2006,"Slither is about a man named Grant Grant who lives in a small town with his wife Starla. One day after being attacked by a weird creature in the woods Grant starts to act strangely and soon things in town start getting more and more bizarre like a missing woman and mutilated livestock being found. Soon there are slugs crawling all over town and turning people into zombies and it is up to Sheriff Bill Pardy, Starla and some other people from the town to save themselves and others. Slither has good direction, a good script, good performances by the cast, good original music and good makeup and special effects. Slither started out a little flat but as it went along the film built up momentum and soon was quite entertaining and enjoyable. Slither blends both the horror and comedy genres together and successfully blends together both quite well. The film is entertaining and in some ways quite original and inventive as well. In a day and age where most horror films are remakes of classic films it is nice to have an original horror movie come out that has humour, horror and isn't scared to show some of the R rated gore that horror fans crave. Slither is a fun horror movie that seems to be both liked by critics and horror fans and I think it is unfortunate that the film is not doing better than it is. Go see Slither if you are a horror fan while you still can for a fun and enjoyable horror film.",Slither
81,juliankennedy23,Serpentine Serpentine,7,23 December 2006,"Slither: 7 out of 10: Nathan Fillion needs to get more big screen work. He was the captain on Firefly (and its big screen spin-off Serenity) and he brings that same laconic dry humored character to Slither. He is the talented center of an enjoyable romp.Slither consists of way to many timeworn cliché's to list here but in general it is an eighties style creature feature. What sets it apart from is brethren is a top notch cast, (Michael Rooker and Tania Saulnier both put in excellent turns), great special effects, (a minimum of bad CGI and a lot of good make-up effects) and a generally funny script.The only problem with the movie (outside of a tendency to overplay the campy) is that is eminently forgettable. Unlike recent straight horror films such as Saw or Hostel or even recent horror/comedy hybrids such as Shaun of the Dead, Slither doesn't have a single original thought or scene in its pretty little head.It's like that girl you dated in college that was pretty good looking but boring in and out of the sack. (No I can't remember her name either.) I have to concentrate to recall even a couple of scenes from Slither and heck I just watched the thing. I can remember about every scene from American Werewolf in London and I haven't seen that in many moons (Please pardon the lame stretch for a pun.) One critic called it empty calories and I couldn't agree more. No doubt it is a good time for horror and action fans just don't expect any lasting impression.",Slither
82,cchase,"""It Was A Graveyard Smash!""",8,11 April 2006,"Welcome to Wheelsy, population: probably about a sixteenth of the people you'd find in Brooklyn, if that many. It's located due south of Twin Peaks, its main street at the intersection of Evening Shade and Northern Exposure. Its industry? HUNTIN' SEASON. Cultural events: drinkin', line dancin' and more drinkin'. The mayor, Jack MacReady (Gregg Henry) swears with a trucker's mouth at the traffic jam blocking his way in town, which consists of exactly one SUV. The crime rate? So nonexistent, that the leading lights of Wheelsy's police force have nothing better to do than nap and check the flying speed of a whippoorwill with their radar gun, exactly in that order.Nice place for an alien invasion to drop in, isn't it? And since that is the whole point of SLITHER, it's where the movie really takes off. The Town Rich Guy, Grant Grant, (yes, that IS his name and he's played by Michael Rooker, from HENRY: PORTRAIT OF A SERIAL KILLER no less), can't get no ""lovin' from the oven"" of his comely blond trophy wife, Starla (THE 40-YEAR-OLD VIRGIN's Elizabeth Banks,) so off the aging stud-wannabe stomps to the local watering hole where he runs into Brenda Gutierrez (Brenda James), a fresh young thing who's been crushing on him since she was ten. (Eeewww, TMI, but never mind.)In the woods outside Wheelsy, the two are in the midst of a drunken tryst when Grant is distracted by two things: guilt because of Starla, and something that looks like it could've crawled out of a stray meteorite that fell in the woods...probably because it did. A cross between a loaf of bread gone VERY wrong and a demented Man'O'War jellyfish, when Grant sees it moving, he does what any genius would...he pokes it with a stick. (Uhm, Grant...didn't you ever see THE BLOB when you were a kid?) The alien parasite responds to this form of stimulation as any alien parasite would, leaving poor Grant feeling kinda...wait for it...SLUGGISH. (Bah-DUM-bum). Then, infested with a whole new lease on Wheelsy life, Grant returns to his beloved Starla a truly changed man. She knows this by the way he makes love, (TMI a-GAIN,) and also by the way he starts buying and storing insane amounts of raw meat in the basement, in a nearby barn, and also begins to incorporate animal carcasses into his new hobby...I want to get into more details, but why spoil the fun? Welcome to the dream ""Monster Mash"" that every fanboy has ever lusted after when he saw Carpenter's THE THING for the eight-thousandth time. Writer/director James Gunn (who penned the DAWN OF THE DEAD remake) just happens to be one of those guys. He pays homage to while wickedly delivering ""purple-nurples"" to every monster movie convention we've come to know and love, since the first time we saw Kevin McCarthy running down the middle of the street hollering ""YOU'RE NEXT!"" And because we all know monster/alien invasion/zombie movies so well, by rights none of SLITHER should really work. But it does for a couple of reasons: Gunn knows how to walk that tightrope between not enough and way too much, be it humor or horror, and because he got himself one of the best casts to help him out since that other outstanding cult classic that shares a similar pedigree, TREMORS.Besides Henry, Rooker, Banks and James, there's the outstanding Nathan Fillion (FIREFLY and SERENITY's stalwart Captain Mal Reynolds) as Sheriff-turned-Police Chief Bill Pardy, whom up until now only had to deal with deer infestations and Grant Grant stealing the girl of his dreams by marrying her. Each cast member gets their own ""special"" moment to shine (and/or slime), and do it with tongue firmly in oozing cheek. And bravo to Tania Saulnier as the petrified-but-plucky Kylie, a teen who's favorite hero clearly must be Jamie Lee Curtis from the old days.This is a movie that clearly won't be everyone's cup of cellulose slop, but if you are reading this review in the first place, what more do you need, an invitation?

83,BroadswordCallinDannyBoy,"Scrumptious serving of splatter, spoof, slugs and scares",8,24 June 2007,"A mysterious (not really) meteorite crashes (as always) near a small town. Out of it slithers (pardon the pun) a strange creature that is could be (read: obviously is) a dangerous parasite that is a danger to the whole world. It's up to Police Chief Bill Pardy to save his people by slugging it out (last pun, promise) with some nasty invaders.'Slither' is obviously unoriginal in its 'plot.' I almost always must be convinced of the plot to like a movie, though special effects alone - if they are awesome like in ""Twister"" or ""ID4"" - can sometimes manage to make a movie at least entertaining and guilty pleasure-ish. ""Slither"" is not one of those movies. It's better. ""Shaun of the Dead"" was a parody of George Romero's ""Dead Trilogy"" and this is a movie in the same vein, just that it spoofs ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers."" Also, in the same vein as Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg, James Gunn here doesn't just take scene after scene from his inspirations and makes it goofy. The spoof is in the tone which is right where it should be. There are plenty of little references to horror in popular culture, like Goosebumps books among others. I remember reading Goosebumps books obsessively and it is really fun to see someone spoofing a genre who really knows it. Any horror fan will find little bits and moments just like that.Then for the gore hound in each horror fan, rest assured, ""Slither"" delivers the splatter and it delivers it well. There is good use of special effects - computer and aesthetic - that shows very little of their limitations. A particularly cool shot is as a slug crawls along a tile floor and into a bathtub and it comes complete with the little CGI vermin making a little, but very real, splash. In addition, there are some visual hints as to the origin of the crawling little villain and initially this might seem like a bad idea for a horror movie since it effectively erases the mystery and the eeriness, but here that is not the case. The slight explanation and brief sequence showing the origins of the slugs actually adds to the fun and tension.Sadly, though somewhat predictably, this film was a flop at the box office, but cult status is surely on the way. --- 8/10Rated R for violence/gore and profanity",Slither

85,mario_c,The killing slugs from the outer space,5,1 April 2007,"It's a horror comedy that is plenty of gore scenes and pretty nice jokes too. However the plot seems to be a little silly and doesn't bring anything new to the genre. In fact, what I liked the most was definitely the corrosive humour that is really funny at parts. The kind of jokes used is the commonly used in the dark comedies (or horror comedies) but are very well conceived and are very sarcastic. Especially the Mayor character, it's excellent. But, on the other hand, the ""part"" of the movie connected to the horror is not so good (except some good gore scenes), because it is nothing special. It's just a zombies' flick with these little ""monsters"" (in this case slugs) from the outer space. I don't know but it all seemed a bit foolish to me",Slither
86,RonellSowes,Amusing But Stupid,3,20 August 2021,"Slither is the type of movie that makes you feel that a major company gave gave a substantial budget to an amateurs filmmaker for one of his b-grade films. It's a blend of multiple what you might call classics of the genre like The Night of the Living Dead and The Thing with little bit of it's own seasoning thrown in to make one very composite movie that doesn't stay heading in the same direction for more than a short time before switching over. However, the movie is still bound together with its tounge in cheek, campy style and a disregard for gratuitous violence and gore to make Tarantino envy.Slither is quite frankly, a low quality movie that's pretty stupid, but it also can amuse with it's over the top action and lighthearted attitude.",Slither

He infects one man which in turn starts to infect the rest of the town using these little slug worm things that slither inside your mouth go to your brain and I guess start controlling the host somehow.This movie is very cheesy so if you don't like B horror movies stay away from this one for sure.

This reminds me of a mash of Invasion of the Body Snatchers, Night of the Living Dead, and Shivers. It's a blast. The biggest problem is the shifting of the character we are watching. We see the sheriff, then we follow Grant for a half an hour, and then we switch back to the sheriff. It's odd. But once Grant gets fishy and Nathon Fillion takes the lead, the movie picks up. If you like seeing blood spit on people, sexually tinged womby scenes, bad southern clichés, an expletive expunging Gregg Henry, or meat; this is the movie for you.P.S.

Because, up until this point, I thought I was watching a countrified remake of ""Night of the Creeps!""Nobody in the theater, that I went to see this at, laughed during the first half-hour or so. And, either this was due to the actors being so straight-faced. Or, to the intended jokes being not-as-funny as anticipated. Then, came the scene where Sheriff Pardy (Nathan Filion of ""Firefly"" fame), and his posse, have set a trap for the alienized local millionaire with the unlikely name of ""Grant Grant"" (I kid you not!).The oldest deputy in the bunch (who resembles a clean-shaven John Carpenter) spouts that soon-to-be classic line. And, the rest of the movie becomes a fast-paced gorefest from that point on! The bathtub scene was given a refreshing touch by Kylie getting flashes of the space-slugs' collective genetic memory while struggling to get one of them out of her mouth. *Can you say...EWWWWWWW?* On the whole, however, I still think ""Stay Alive"" was much scarier. It sure succeeded in scaring me. And, with only half the profanity usage that this movie had! Although, I did like the end-title song.

The plot is that a man, who looks surprisingly similar to Bryan Cranston as he appears in ""Breaking Bad"", stumbles upon a meteorite in a forest and within is a weird egg sac that infects him. So the now guy starts acting funny as hell and is getting strange symptoms. This isn't any bee sting people. His wife is drifting further away as he starts munching on dogs and impregnates another woman with his essence.Well by the time things really start going, he becomes this revolting monster that has apparently been feeding his new mate way too much....I'm sure you remember that in the trailers.

By the time the law takes any real action the whole tri-county area is infected with little baby aliens that look like severed tongues. Meanwhile, there's a love story in the works and a mayor who delivers a lot of our off-beat humor. But just when you think you've seen it all, a squid-man, a lady with quadruplets x 1000, and slithering, severed, tongues, there's a really repulsive thing going on in our heroine's living room....It appears this alien entity from millions of years ago is one sick guy. Overall, the reactions just aren't real enough for me. When you see things like that, your reaction is first and foremost is not to say, ""What are we supposed to do?

91,moviesleuth2,Great cheesy fun,7,4 March 2010,"There is no possible way anyone can take ""Slither"" seriously. This is a B-movie, and proud of it. Unlike most of the horror comedies out there these days, the humor is not all in-jokes and pop culture references. This is a movie where the main character says to her husband that she'll stick by him, even though he's transformed into a hideous alien, because ""marriage is a sacred bond."" Starla Grant (Elizabeth Banks) is a sprightly young teacher in a small town, married to a man named Grant Grant (Michael Rooker). But when out for a walk, Grant gets stung by something, and he changes (physically and mentally). Pretty soon it's Starla and the local police chief (Nathan Fillion) who are up against an alien invasion.The acting is solid. Elizabeth Banks, who is no stranger to comedy, gets a chance to play a complete caricature. She's hilarious as the brainless hick, whose ""wholesome values"" venture into absurdity. Nathan Fillion is excellent as Bill. He's a caricature too, yet we can actually feel for him. Character actor Michael Rooker is also good as Grant Grant, the husband who changes for the worse. Of the main characters, the only one who doesn't work is Tania Sauliner, who plays Kylie, the lone survivor of an attack by slugs. Fortunately, she doesn't have many lines.The film isn't perfect; James Gunn's shot choices aren't perfect and sometimes the dialogue is hard to hear, but he should be congratulated for making a film that achieves laughs and chills.

94,the-movie-guy,Slither is your B-grade horror/comedy movie that has everything and is hilarious,8,31 March 2006,"(Synopsis) The movie opens with a meteorite landing in the backwoods of the small town of Wheelsy. The bad news is that our atmosphere did not burn up everything inside the meteorite. One of Wheelsy's rich business men, Grant Grant (Michael Rooker), who is married to the young and beautiful high school biology teacher, Starla (Elizabeth Banks), finds a slow moving slimy thing behind the town bar. The slug stops moving as Grant moves closer, he becomes infected by the slug. Grant begins to change and evolve into a bloodthirsty meat-eating squid creature with a need to kill to maintain his life. Sheriff Bill Pardy (Nathan Fillion) and Starla must defeat this creature or the entire earth will be consumed.(My Comment) Slither is a 1950's type B-grade horror/comedy movie scenario that has everything. A billion-year-old alien parasite from outer space with penetrating tentacles that sucks the life out of you, fast moving slugs that want to get inside your mouth, dogs and cows being eaten by human and deer zombies, an enormous mother glob, and the small town being terrorized by a monster. This is your classic B-grade movie that is a lot of fun watching. You will laugh from beginning to end. For budget reasons, it looks like they used the old standby, tomato ketchup, for blood. There are some scary moments, but most of the scenes are hilarious. If you want an enjoyable night and a good laugh, this is the movie to see.

However, the film has plenty of faults - it starts out reeeeeaaaal slow. Now I'm not one of these people who want things snappy and always moving but there is such a thing as a steady pace and I realize Gunn is setting up the town and the characters, etc. but there really isn't much happening at first. BUT, once the main horror conflict gets going and they find the huge pregnant girl in the barn - well, that's when the film just takes off and is so much fun. There are many classic scenes. Gregg Henry and Michael Rooker do real strong work here - nice to see these veteran character actors get a chance to strut their stuff. I also felt that the blend of the comedy and the gore really didn't work that well. Gunn is a better horror writer than he is a comedy writer. There were many times when an exciting, tense scene would stop for a joke but...the joke would be really weak. That's not to say there aren't funny moments - there are. But what he seems to be trying for doesn't work as well as in say American Werewolf In London or Shaun Of The Dead - two examples of where horror and comedy do blend well together.

There is almost a scare or a scene developing then they fade to black and a long section follows with nothing scary at all. There is little, or kind of bad, music as well that could have helped to pump up some sense of growing horror or at least tie the scenes together. Since it fails to really grab you right at the start by the time it gets better you really are more of less ready for it to be over. There are probably too many characters or they just aren't developed enough. There is some humor but it's not a horror comedy either. The best thing about it are the FX both on set and with CG but they aren't so great to make up for the other defects.A curious misfire. The first time director shows his neophyte weaknesses. Pacing is uneven as well. I'm all for this kind of film which made it more of a letdown for me. Maybe this films tries to do too much to succeed at any one thing. The most potentially interesting element is the husband and wife section with him slowing monsterizing, but this gets forgotten though both the actors are good. There just seems to be no successful focus to the whole movie. Little bit of this little bit of that ultimately doesn't add up despite some good moments.",Slither

Then you've been Slithered.,8,28 February 2007,"This was the pleasant surprise of 2006's cinema realises; this half cousin once removed distant relation to the Troma family. A tiny and neat combination of comedy and horror takes a stab at both B-Movie sci-fi and horror genres, and is a fitting tribute and honorary member to this well loved class of movie.Its director James Gunn is an interesting character, with two examples of his writing ability going to Tromeo and Juliet (1996) and ""The Tromaville Café"" TV series (1997), and starring in the odd Troma movie too. To add to the Troma myth, The Toxic Avenger (1985) is seen on the Brenda Gutierrez character TV set and its director Lloyd Kaufman playing an uncredited role as a sad drunk, for a brief moment, a fitting tribute. It may be his writing for such movies as Tromeo and Juliet, Scooby-Doo (2002) and Dawn of the Dead (2004) that prompted him to write, and for the first time direct, this alien cum zombie flick.During one night in modern day small town America, when a meteorite drops in the local wood and unleashes its tiny slug shaped parasitic pilot that sooner than later infects the local inhabitants, turning their infected hosts into Zombie type creatures. Not your most original of stories, but it's not what you have it's what you do with it that has given this movie its twist, it being the addition of comedy, a rare commodity for this sci-fi genre. Not a slapstick nor is it a laugh fest, but a very clever script that contains much wit and great one-liners to carry this off as very amusing, albeit with a fun and varied cast such as the local level headed Sheriff Nathan Fillion (Bill Pardy) and the more than overly rude and persistent mayor Jack MacReady (Gregg Henry). Along too for the ride are the local sheriff department and the town's inhabitants who give a fine natural feel of absurdity amid the confusion and turmoil.On the flip side, the horror aspect is just as competent, we are troubled by these little slimy and infectious bugbears, but toward the end, it is the much larger threat of personal invasion and inner change that Slither takes on its sinister direction. This is a fine blend of fun and frolics that turns out to be an adventure of ghastly proportions. Fangoria Chainsaw Awards gave Slither their highest accolade by way off Award for Highest Body Count for 2006, and yes, well deserved it is too, now that's horror doing its job without fault.Slither makes a pleasant change to the B-Movies of yesteryear who whilst trying their best to be taken seriously, but through time ended up mocked, loved and revered for all the wrong reasons. Slither knows its potential and never takes itself seriously enough to look like it has to try, this work's fine on its own and it works well.Nevertheless, it is the disappointing cinema box office takings, very much like the Troma movies, that can in time be looked upon as a defining moment that turned this movie around and which has it placed in the category of cult status.

105,Quicksand,B-Movie Goodness,8,1 April 2006,"All through the 1980's, the line between a ""scary"" movie was crossed with a ""gross-out"" movie. It was maybe a little bit suspenseful that you didn't know which direction Jason or Freddy was gonna come from, but mostly the audience was all about the payoff: the gore, the guts, the squish. ""Slither"" isn't scary... but it's bloodier than any movie I can remember seeing since ""Evil Dead 2."" Or, alternatively, the ""Dawn of the Dead"" remake.James Gunn wrote 2004's ""Dawn of the Dead,"" and in it he found an incredible director, Zack Snyder. Gunn also wrote the two Scooby Doo movies, in which he found a terrible director, Raja Gosnell. Directing here for the first time, Gunn is better than Gosnell, worse than Snyder... though the budget is assuredly smaller, and I'm not sure if the un-scariness is on purpose or not.Gross? You betcha. Cleverly so, in ways that Troma Studios (Gunn's former employer) could never adequately pay for. There's creativity here, and some really great actors (Nathan Fillion, Elizabeth Banks, Michael Rooker, Gregg Henry) who do an admirable job despite being a tad under-directed-- with the exception of Fillion, they all seem to take it a little too seriously. On the other hand, this film features the first instance in cinematic history of a character being attacked by an undead deer. So there's that.It's a great B-movie time at the movies, so I'll give this movie a B, an 8/10... for what it is, of course (it's no Citizen Kane/Star Wars/Shawshank Redemption/Snakes on a Plane).

106,refresh_daemon,Serious gross-out alien invasion zombie madness with a nice dose of humor,8,28 November 2006,"Ever since I saw the previews for this film, I've been looking forward to seeing it, but never got the chance while it was in theaters. I finally caught it on DVD and have to admit that it was everything I thought it would be: a funny, gross, oft-tense ride through camp horror, that never aspires to greatness, but hits all the notes of an entertaining popcorn flick (if you can eat popcorn while watching the often disgusting events portrayed on the screen.The plot is pretty simple. A meteorite falls into a sleepy backwoods town containing an alien of some sort. It starts turning the residents into zombies and it falls to an increasingly small group of people to save both the town and their own skins. The setting of a small backwoods town helps in preventing the terrible incident from holding more scale than believable and the characters (even the badass monster) are surprisingly well written and even a little fresh at times. The movie still holds to its admittedly exploitative roots, but manages to inject some black and off-kilter humor into those moments that one can see the winking nature of them.The performances, though not immensely demanding, are all up to par. The directing and editing is relentless, giving you only enough of a break to catch your breath before taking you on the ride again. And the overall look of the film is simple but effective. The creature appearances are even jokes themselves (the slugs especially) or turned into jokes by the characters.That's not to say that there aren't a few problems with the film and these primarily lie in internal logic. The zombies don't behave consistently and sometimes behave in such a way that allows the protagonists to get away where it wouldn't make sense with the scale of the invasion. But aside from a few points where I would slap my head in disbelief, the rest of the film flows pretty smoothly and enjoyably.If you can handle serious gross-out alien invasion zombie madness with a nice dose of humor, you'll find Slither to be an enjoyable ride. It doesn't aim to be a masterpiece, but what it does aim for, it hits on almost every note. 8/10.",Slither

When it's funny, it's really funny, with snappy and memorable bits of dialog and plenty of moments that are so disgusting you can't help but laugh. When it wants to give you the creeps, it works too. There is a lot of tension during the film, mostly because when people die here they die really ghoulish and unsettling deaths. You've actually grown to care for the characters and you don't want them to die... never mind die the way people do in this film! I hope this movie finds the audience it deserves because this one is not going to be for everyone. ""Slither"" does not pull its punches. When an alien takes over a body through unpleasant means, not only do they show you enough that you will be squirming in your seat, you will be covering your eyes by the end of the movie because this is one sick, gory movie. Yup, I loved it. It's supposed to be disturbing and because it actually is, the movie becomes truly memorable. I'll admit there's also kind of a sick side to enjoying the film because you're always wondering what kind of gruesome mess they're going to pull off next.

109,Quebec_Dragon,Attack of the Killer Slugs from Outer Space !!!,6,3 August 2010,"Slither is a throwback or homage to horror movies from the eighties mixed in with a little of the fifties. In a small redneck US town, it starts as a creepy alien possession story, becomes more of a creature feature and then veers into ""zombie"" territory. Those 3 elements stay active with more and less emphasis. All of this is rather humorous because of the absurdity of certain situations and the corniness. The actors, with a few exceptions, play it seriously (as when the wife talks to the ludicrous-looking creature in the field). Slither also delights in contrasting, or alternating, scenes of joy and brutality, humor and horror. It plays with our expectations for the characters and then surprises us. The sheriff is more incompetent than expected, the sweet teacher has a mean side...My favorite, and probably the most memorable moment, was the second monster we see (the fat one in the barn). At first, you laugh then as something else happens, you are surprised, disgusted and then smiling again. The special effects, mostly for the creatures, were hit and miss. The worms or slugs, usually computer generated, were usually fine and creepy. The first possessed in different stages looked more ludicrous than disturbing (but then that was probably intended) and his tentacles/tendrils could have been better. The worst was the creature in the sheriff's office near the end that looked really fake but weirdly it somehow made it funnier. There are gory moments but they're usually over quickly. Most disturbing, or fun for some sick people ;-), would be the phallic associations with the worms/tentacles, especially a ""rape"" scene involving two tentacles and a belly. Nothing really sexually explicit here, it's all implied and the only real nudity is a nipple you see for a fraction of a second (don't expect more because of the box cover with the woman in the bathtub). The ""zombie"" aspect was pretty lame not only in terms of horror but also of makeup and especially movements (fake looking). Provided you don't expect too much, Slithers can be quite entertaining provided you're looking for b-movie horror with more emphasis on humor than fright.Rating: 6 out of 10 (Good)",Slither
110,anhedonia,What a great surprise!,8,7 December 2006,"I like horror films, but am not fan of the latest slew that are either remakes of much better films from 20, 30 years ago, or these ultra-violent escapades whose only attraction seems to be endless body counts and coming up with extremely violent and gory ways to slaughter people. I know these films have a following, but I've had no interest in sitting through them.So it was with tremendous apprehension that I rented ""Slither."" Two reasons I got it - I vaguely recall reading a critic who said it was funny and I am an Elizabeth Banks fan. Loved her as Betty Brant in Sam Raimi's ""Spider-Man"" films, ""Baxter"" (2005) and ""Heights"" (2004). I even rented ""Sexual Life"" (2005) because she was in it.What a refreshing surprise ""Slither"" turned out to be. Writer-director James Gunn knows he's essentially making ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers Meets Night of the Living Dead"" and he has tremendous fun with that premise. Thing is, Gunn never treats his film seriously, but all his characters do, which is what makes comedy work. The reason we laugh so heartily at all those ""The Naked Gun"" movies is because Frank Drebin and Co. take what they're doing completely seriously. No one's laughing at their own jokes.That's why ""Slither"" works so well, too. The writing is snappy, funny; at times, it's downright hilarious. The film's constantly lively, hugely entertaining, never boring and surprisingly quick-witted. I watched the film alone and found myself laughing out loud on several occasions. The measure of a good comedy is when you can do that.""Slither"" never hides the fact that it's a low-budget horror. But the actors are all game and, although Gunn is working with archetypes of the genre, he throws in plenty of freshness and originality to keep propelling his movie forward.Gunn clearly is a big fan of horror movies. More than that, he loves them. It's obvious. And he pours all that love and respect into this film. There's really nothing surprising in this plot, but it's the journey that makes ""Slither"" worthwhile.Of course, there are better horror films than ""Slither."" But occasionally it's good to sit back and enjoy a film for what it is. It's good to be able to laugh at something silly, but not stupid. There are scenes here that are hysterically funny. Starla's (Banks) recounting of her marriage vows in the middle of a field still makes me laugh.Let me put it this way.

Practical effects abound, with some delightfully over the top sequences, and an acceptable peppering of bad CGI. It's weirdly high budget and well crafted given it's trashy nature. Not as uncomfortably squeamish as I would have imagined, the complete lack of self seriousness makes all the gore easy to digest.

Horror-wise, this is a serious horror contender - though it is nowhere near as realistic, disturbing or gritty as Shaun of the Dead, its fast pace and scenes that simply jump up and bite you make it a real fright-fest. It is also strange at the start - why do the infected people love meat so much? This film is definitely not for animal-lovers (especially one scene in the first 20 minutes) - which probably lost it a lot of appeal and made it flop at the box office. Though the film does become more disturbing towards the end and we actually feel that our characters are being pursued by an evil force from which they can't escape, this film is very hard to take seriously and is really just for people who want a joke of a viewing. Guns and fights are abandoned for gore and monsters - which is really what Slither intended. It is very unpredictable and shocking in parts, but as with all horror films these days, everything is resolved towards the end.Whereas Shaun of the Dead was hilarious, sharp and expertly written, this film is really just over-the-top gory fun - but be honest, wasn't this what the studios intended Slither to be? 8/10",Slither

With a solid mixture of nasty-looking creatures, intentionally stupid dark comedy, and a couple of surprising moments of legitimate tension, I have to say ""mission accomplished."" If you aren't in the mood to see tentacles burrowing into stomachs, bloated bodies exploding, people being sliced in half, and alien slugs forcing their way down throats then you're gonna want to sit this one out.

Horror-action is great horror-thriller is obvious but horror-comedy seems just like really weird combination like chilly-honey sauce.I hated chilly-honey sauce the first time I tried it and like-wise I hated the first few movies of this genre I watched like the Evil-Dead series. Soon enough though I was consuming the sauce by the bucket and have loved every movie of this genre since then the cheesy special effects got me liking B-movies to eventually.This movie is literally an ode to classics such as tremors,the fly, and such monster movies and is every bit as good.The acting is as good as can be with a superb performance from Greg Henry as the mayor McReady (the thing), he was clearly the best part about the movie and had hilarious one-liners and an attitude to boot.Technically this movie was superb with the special effects clearly trying to imitate the special effects of the yesteryear's even though it may have been done with the help of computers instead of real objects. In any case they keep up with the spirit of the lower budget horror-comedies to the fullest.The story is completely inspired with no originality on this front (for some time i thought it was completely inspired by Invasion by Robin Cook) but it does seem like an ode to this genre and so you really don't mind the unoriginality.Horror rarely scares me anymore and even much scarier films have failed to scare me since a childhood incidence involving the omen (read other reviews) but even though this movie is not genuinely scary it does have its tense moments (that are brilliant fused with comedy) such as the shower scene and the bath-tub nevertheless TJERE IS NO REALLY SCARY MOMENT TO SPEAK OF AS SUCH BUT THERE ARE A BUNCH OF THRILLING SCENES WITH SOME GOOD ACTION.The comedy is a different ball game though this movie is absolutely hilarious with loads of great one-liners and some genuinely funny scenes mainly involving the mayor, the scene with the dear and the grenade were also hilarious.The chicks are good but there is no real exposure with most of the stuff that will easily pass the PG-13 rating (how i hate PG-13) in this case I really expected some more and was disappointed by the lack of exposure given the rating.The has pretty much has something for everybody with a liberal dose of comedy mixed with some good action and thrilling moments.This movie isn't to be taken seriously and like the Chilly-honey sauce it takes some getting used to and if you don't get the point (acquire the taste) very soon then you may not enjoy this movie.Those who like the genre will love this movie and people who like comedies in general can easily rent this movie.A genuinely good movie of this genre that can be enjoyed by everybody (in India even the teens) including girls.Perfect for renting and watching with a bunch of friends.-s not really scary, PG-13 exposure.+/-s not original (an ode so some people may not get the point),taking it seriously will lead to disaster.+s genuinely funny, fine performances especially the mayor, great one-liners, some good action/thrilling moments,stays with the theme.total 8/10 (factoring in the fact that it met expectations and the genre please don't compare it to godfather and dis my review).",Slither
115,CMRKeyboadist,My Two Cents...,8,25 October 2006,"I wasn't sure what to expect with Slither as I have heard many conflicting opinions on this movie. I know the trailer looked pretty good, but, I didn't want to pay 9 dollars to see it in the theaters. It just came out on DVD so I bought it and just got done watching it. What we have is a mix of Invasion of the Body Snatchers and Night of the Creeps thrown together to form a disgusting blob of a film, which I happened to enjoy very much.Michael Rooker (Henry: Portait of a Serial Killer) stars as a man who is having problems with his wife at home. So, one night he decides to go to the local bar and pick up a girl. As they go out to the forest to mess around, they discover a fallen meteorite. A slug like creature attacks him and takes over his body, possessing him. Unbeknownst to his wife and the rest of the community, Rooker plots an invasion like none other by infecting the townspeople to start a breeding ground for world domination.I got a real kick out of this movie. It is maybe once every 5 to 10 years we get a movie like this that you can truly call a monster movie. It has all of the classic elements that make it worth the while using ideas from Invasion of the Body Snatchers and Night of the Creeps. If you haven't seen this and you have seen the other movies, this is definitely worth your 15 bucks. 8/10 P.S. You will probably never look at Michael Rooker the same way again.",Slither
116,RockPortReview,Awesome Retro B-Horror with Michael Rooker!,8,16 June 2013,"In the spirit of the cheesy monster movies of years past ""Slither"" is quite the enjoyable film. It's as funny as it is disgusting and bizarre. Directed by James Gunn, who previously worked at famed B-movie studio Troma, brings the same attitude and felling to ""Slither"" although with a much bigger budget.Taking place in Wheelsey, South Carolina this movie has a deep southern feel to it. Starring Elizabeth Banks as Starla a young southern belle married to the much older Grant, whose last name is also Grant, played by the intense Michael Rooker. The town sheriff Bill Pardy is played by genre icon Nathan Fillion. Many other movies come to mind while watching this like ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"", ""Night of the Creeps"" and many more.We open with a meteorite crashing down in a wooded area of Wheelsey behind Bill and his partners squad car as they whittle away an extremely slow and boring night. We see Starla and Grant have an argument and he heads off to the bar and picks up a local chick name Brenda. There is also has another woman in the bar singing karaoke to ""The Crying Game"" which is pretty funny. Grant and Brenda wander into the woods where he stumbles upon a giant slug like creature that upon investigation shoots him with a sort of worm dart that takes control of his brain. This also begins about his slow and gruesome transformation. He now has an insatiable hunger for raw meat. The next night while Starla waits for Grant at the big Deer Cheer dance she reconnects with Bill whose had a crush on her for years. Grant is a no show at the dance and Bill gives her a ride home as they talk and bond Probably the funniest character, although not initially, is the douche bag mayor Jack MacReady (MacReady was also the name of Kurt Russell's character in ""The Thing""). He is an arrogant jerk who gets all of the best one liners and his reactions to all of the mayhem are priceless. Grant ""impregnates"" Brenda with his alien appendages who is then stuck into a barn and turns into a giant and I mean giant blob, who eventually explodes releasing tons of slithering slugs that go in through you mouth a turn you into a brain dead zombie. Many of the locals get zombified and its up to our heroes Bill, Starla and a teenage girl named Kylie, whose family was also turned, to save the day. Grant is now a giant Jaba the Hut like creature with tentacles. The final showdown is nothing too special but the movie as a whole is pretty crazy fun to watch.

117,smellthecult-com-1,Alien parasites,8,28 December 2009,"Probably as close as Hollywood will get to making a 'proper' horror movie for quite some time.The Plot: A small community in South Carolina is over-run by alien parasites that turn their hosts into flesh hungry killers, all channelled through one mind.A likable cast of relative unknowns (well, Fillion was in Firefly, I guess) really get into the spirit of things, playing out the B movie action with commendably straight faces. Comedy horror is always a fine line to tread, and this stays just the right side of wacky to be acceptable.The movie is clearly a homage to the legendary Night of the Creeps despite the directors claims to the contrary (I think he said he has never even seen that movie. Yeah, right) as well as visual effects nods to such great fare as From Beyond, Basket Case and Society.For those desperately mourning the sad demise of American horror, this one might keep you going for a few months longer.",Slither

In Slither he revisits the old staple of small American Town - filmed in Canada for tax purposes, infected with a nasty alien strain. Locals are corrupted, unpleasantness ensues and naturally its left to a small band of disparate residents to fight back and save civilisation. Its good if derivative B-Movie Fodder, pregnant with Gunn's favourite crap from the 70's and 80's, but the balance of body horror, jokes and clichés works very nicely and although its a little slow to get started it a tight 90 minutes of fan boy indulgence masquerading as low-grade social comment. If your interested there's also a inference here that if Grant's wife had just consented to sex on demand then the whole thing could have been avoided and many lives saved. You see the message there ladies? You might not be in the mood but people can die because of your selfishness.

The realization was ok, but as a experienced horror movie watcher, I would like to have seen some more originality. I can give that movie a 6/10 when taking it as a homage to the former horror movies of the 60s, 80s.

I watched this mostly for Nathan Fillion. The two female leads were OK, but Nathan really steals the show. Rooker actually was the scene stealer, but luckily they did not really have any scenes together until the end. I loved some of the ridiculous set pieces and monster designs. The big Brenda was brilliant and way over the top. Nathan's reactions are priceless and what makes him such a great actor. He is really able to play of a scene and other actors really well. The story line was nothing special, but I liked how they tried to keep the love story between Starla and Grant and not between Starla and Nathan. I like how Nathan just had a crush on her and it never amounted to anything else. The special effects was really cool and I really enjoyed watching all of the gross stuff that they came up with and how well it was executed on screen it was. I like how one could tell it was made by people who are used to working with a small budget and they used their budget to get the shots that they wanted. This movie was not particularly scary, but I do not think many of these movies are. It was more fun to see how crazy and weird everything could get by the end.",Slither

Nathan Fillion, Michael Rooker and Elizabeth Banks give very great and silly performances as residence in this small town thats being over run. iv never heard of the director ""Jamie Gunn"" but he's made a classic out of this.

OK, let's face it... this one isn't going to win any awards for originality. The story here is ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" meets ""Night of the Living Dead"" with hints of ""The Blob,"" David Cronenburg's ""Shivers,"" and a more-than-passing special effects nod to Brian Yuzna's ""Society."" But it WORKS here.James Gunn, a veteran of Troma Studios, has made a horror fan's horror flick. Laced with homages to everything from 1950's drive in cinema to R.L. Stine's ""Goosebumps"" books (not to mention a clip from a Troma movie on a TV in one scene). Gunn clearly knows his audience, because he IS his audience. He delivers up a movie that might be formulaic, but its over-the-top gore, it's black humor (this is one horror show that never takes itself too seriously), and it's general gung-ho, pull-no-punches attitude turn what could have been yet another plodding bit of cinematic flotsam into what could well be an instant horror classic on par with ""Re-Animator.""

Well it should because that it is all there is to it in Slither. Again, the same story has been told in much better films such as ""The Blob"" (1958) and ""It came from Outer Space"" (1953). There is not an ounce of originality in ""Slither"", nada! So, in order to make up for the poor script and lack of ideas they had to resort to gross out special effects. And, after a while, even gross out scenes became tedious and ridicule. So there is nothing much to see in the film...It was supposed to be a comedy-horror film. The comedy is not there and the people that made the film thought that gross out scenes was synonymous with horror. So, in the end we have a mess of a film that is neither funny nor scary.

128,boyinflares,"Funny, Gross, Sad and a bit Over-Rated",6,11 November 2006,"After eagerly awaiting to see this back-water horror, I am somewhat disappointed, as it did not live up to my expectations, nor the hype surrounding it. It is easy enough to see why so many people herald ""Slither"", but over-all, it is not the masterpiece people claim it to be, simply because it seems to lack a sense of ""fullness"".That's not to say ""Slither"" is a bad movie, it was enjoyable to an extent. Somewhat over-acted, the cast mostly do a good job. Nathan Fillion is good as Bill Pardy, Gregg Henry is fine as the rather annoying Mayor MacReady, Michael Rooker is hilarious as the tragic Grant Grant, scene-stealing Jenna Fischer is terrific as Shelby, but it is Elizabeth Banks who deserves the most praise as Starla Grant. Banks carries the film and is certainly the most interesting of the characters - another problem the film has is that the majority of the characters are rather uninteresting and you simply to not care for them.There are countless gross-out moments throughout the film, but nothing really horrifying, so it is hard to class ""Slither"" as a horror, even though it is supposed to be a modern telling of the old 70's horrors of this type. For that reason, there are also a lot of funny moments (sometimes associated with the gross moments I should point out), but just to prove that the film is not totally without compassion, Bill and Starla's stories are very human and compelling, touching to a point, and rather sad.While ""Slither"" may not have been what I expected, there are certainly many worse films around, and it is still worth a watch.",Slither

Really nasty, effectively scary imagery
Good action scenes, do some clever things with acid and slugs
Very well shot
Great use of setting, use every chance to portray a southern small townCons:
Plays too fast and loose with the rules regarding the aliens and how they operate, would've liked more concrete rules
Some annoying characters
Very clear plot armor for certain charactersBest part: revealing Grant's final form, make good use of the hivemind aspect and music, great closure to the escalation of the imagery
Worst part: the slugs ignoring the main characters after leaving the womb, highlights the lack of thought regarding rules",Slither

The film starts out middle-of-the-road, and at parts where it dragged. However, after that first hour or so, chaos ensued and this movie was on a roll.I decided to keep my review short and precise because with a film of this kind, you either like it or you don't.

133,mrush,Pretty good monster flick,6,1 January 2007,"Not many movies can combine horror, gore and humor successfully.This one does. And it doesn't fall into that cutesy type snide humor that is so often tried in these types of movies.Good writing is essential to pull off a witty gore movie and this one has it.A small town is over run with slugs ,zombies and other gross creatures after a meteorite crashes and infects one of the locals.A few folks who aren't turned into any of the above band together to survive and try and defeat these weird life forms that have taken over their town.Besides good writing this movie has great actors who are totally believable in the various gross and funny scenes.Also this movie has some very good special effects.I don't know how they did it but the giant slugs looked so real has they oozed all over the town.After the slugs would infect a human by burrowing into their mouths the humans would become acid spewing zombies which was a pretty cool twist even if it wasn't as fully explored as it could have been.Just think a new twist to zombies--they spew acid.Oh well maybe a whole movie of acid spewing zombies next time.This movie has just the right amount of humor without becoming stupid like ""Army of Darkness"" and some others that have tried to combine horror and comedy.""Slither"" worked on all levels and the only reason I gave it a six was that it was a bit slow at times and the action wasn't as unrelenting and manic as it should have been if a town was overrun by space slugs.And it didn't have any skin which I think is essential for a good cheesy horror flick to have.While not a great horror flick it is above average compared to what we get today under the horror genre.""Slither"" is certainly worth the rental fee.",Slither
134,jamhorner,Slithering to Success!,9,5 December 2007,"This movie was one of the best parody/reworking of all those C budget Troma pictures, it had the right feel of it, the right plot and gore for it, the only difference between those films and this one is that this one was more like a A-budget version of a low Troma movie. This movie had everything that a good horror comedy should have, right down to the love interest of story. This movie had excessive horror (disturbing alien humanoids, gore, frightening attacks and zombies), it had a great sense of horror that was both perverted and lightened up the situations, there was a great cast and performance and a great plot, with some weird relationships mixed into it. Essentially this movie is about a small town that gets invaded by alien worms that are all interconnected to the ""king"" worm, which has taken over the body of one of the townsfolk. Now the town must ban together and fight the alien force before they become infected and become zombie drones or worse, part of the huge fleshy bulk of the king worm.I will first congratulate the actors and actresses of this film, their performances really made this film worth watching, as well. Nathan Fillion, who stared in Serenity, plays the town sheriff and does a fantastic job playing a somewhat calm monotone man who can be really, unintentionally funny at points. Elizabeth Banks, who plays Starla the wife of Grant Grant, does a perfect job for the stereotypical damsel in distress. Her performance was absolutely perfect, even though her part did not demand that much of serious acting, she does a terrific job screaming and basically being a scream queen. Michael Rooker who plays Grant Grant, the most ideal and loving person in the whole town who becomes the ""king worm."" His performance, from scene one to the last, was amazing and he really brought his character to life. He used his monotone voice, in accompanied with some funny moments involving his chest and some great scary moments when he slowly turns into the slug and when he is the ""king slug."" Gregg Henry, who plays MacReady, plays the funniest person in the whole movie mostly because he is fowl mouth, sort of sex induced and just generally a big hoot, especially some of his rants that he goes on when the situation gets worse. There were also some great acting by Tania Saulnier and Haig Sutherland. The scares in this movie were prime, mostly because they weren't ""jump out"" scares, but rather graphic, gory and disturbing scares. Literally, as I mentioned before, it had the feel of a very gory Troma movie, which was a huge inspiration for writer and director James Gunn. Some of the most disturbing parts happen toward the end when people literally become part of the ""king slug"" and the whole process of body transformation that takes place. Some great scares came along with the little slugs that would fly into your mouth and try to take over you, the scarier scene was when the slugs invade a nuclear family and take over the little girls, mom and dad and the teenage girl has to save the day. There were some zombie moments, there were some great ""Grant monster"" moments but the one thing that separates this movie from the others is the consistent humor that lightens up the mood for horror fans. In conjunction with Fillion, this film had some hysterical moments involving play on words, heroines fighting back, rants and reactions to extreme situations. The plot is packed with great special effects, disturbing images and a great love triangle, of sorts. It has everything from the awkward relationship of Grant and Starla, to the stereotypical relationship of the ""cute"" sheriff and the ""hot"" housewife of the mutated husband. It even has the secret affair between the husband and the wife's sister and the inevitable consequences. This movie was certainly a great horror homage to one of the most famous b-movie studies ever, Troma. I really enjoyed this movie and even though there were some minor flaws including some stale acting and story expansion problems, this movie is still a favorite of mine. I would highly recommend this movie to anybody who enjoys movies of the gore and disturbing category and the Troma films. It is true what they say, the chicks in this movie are ""hard-core.""",Slither

136,joker-4,Necessary Ingredients to B-Movie Magic,9,6 July 2007,"Ridiculous? Sure. Gory? Without a doubt. Cliché? Certainly at times but aren't those three ingredients the necessary spices that marinate the typical b-grade film to that of a choice cult classic? You bet! SLITHER, you see, is bred from a high pedigree of b-film classics, and that's even ignoring director James Gunn's connections to all things Troma, attributing the over-the-top gory camp to its grandfather, EVIL DEAD II, and the sci-fi wackiness to that of its father, TREMORS. Gregg Henry's dialog is easily imagined as coming from Bruce Campbell while the romantic tensions between Nathan Fillion and Elizabeth Banks are on the same route as Kevin Bacon and Finn Carter. Other family likenesses include snappy one-liners, a well-intentioned and likable rogue who must stand alone against an invasion of body-snatching space slugs and, of course, unexplained dead things. SLITHER is an entertaining chase that consistently brings just as many laughs as it does screams.Even before the likes of SHAUN OF THE DEAD, genre-blending flicks of comedic horror have always been one of the most difficult theatric tricks to successfully pull off as that delicate balance of acceptance comes into play. For instance, how much camp can be digested before being conceived as ridiculous or simply too much must fit in with the comedic style and tone of the script. Then, how scary and how gory can the film go without being visualized as either an outright terror or a gooey mess? Usually, the answer to those questions is probably luck. However, talent and a true desire for the story does go a long way. Aside from the aforementioned films of Sam Raimi and Ron Underwood, examples of these can be seen with Peter Jackson's DEAD ALIVE, Joe Dante's GREMLINS and John Carpenter's comedic-actioner BIG TROUBLE IN LITTLE CHINA.There is one more element that must be added to the mix: enjoyment. Regardless if the film brings laughter or shrieks, the final result must be satisfaction in the story, the involvement of the characters and the entertaining aspect that the afflictions within are not happening to you. SLITHER satisfies all three desires.So add SLITHER to that ""must see"" list of spectacles where the silliness can become real and accepted and experienced over and over.",Slither

138,alistairc_2000,ripped off night of the creeps,1,9 October 2011,I want to first and foremost say that this movie is a dud. I had a horror night on Monday.. This review has spoilers from the start so if you have-not watched this tosh you might want to read it afterwards to see if you agree.The Plot. A meteor falls to earth in it is the mother slug monster which infects a human. He then infects someone else soon the slugs attack. This sounds good but unfortunately these are not the slugs that Shaun Hutson wrote about in his awesome slugs books (slugs and breeding ground). These slugs crawl in through your mouth. They then turn you into a zombie of sorts. In keeping day of the dead 2 contagion these zombies are telepathic. They have a sort of shared mind. If you take the slugs out and put aliens in you have the plot of independence day you will get the general idea of the movie. The characters. They are all caricatures of real people. We get the joke sheriff who complains that nothing every happens in his small little town. He obviously has not watched any American 50s SF. As when people say that the invaders attack. We get the younger woman who has married the older man just for money. We get the older man who is not getting any sex so he feels he has to play away from home. Lastly we get what is probably the only original character in it movie of the mayor who is foul mouthed and the only funny thing in this movie. All the characters are clichéd bar the mayor. Thoughts on the movie. I was looking forward to watching a horror movie. What I got was a bad sf movie trying to make out like it was a horror movie. This movie sank without a trace in America and I really hope it does the same over here. I really want jimmy Gun the loser who tried to destroy dawn of the dead with his re imagining of it to sink without a trace. I was prepared to give him the benefit of the doubt but this movie was such a derivative pile of dross. 0/10Loads of spoilers and musings. Come on using the climax of Jaws as the climax of your movie and thinking that no one will notice is just so lame. They have a flashback and it just reminds me of the flashback in Ghosts of Mars/quatermass and the pit. When does homage become rip off when you are Jimmy Gun.....,Slither

Romero's zombie favorites, ""Slither"" tells the story of a small town that becomes infested with an alien plague that turns the residents into flesh-eating, acid-spewing zombies. Bill Pardy (Fillion) is one of the town's policemen who, along with a local schoolteacher named Starla Grant (Banks) and high school student Kylie (Saulnier), must try to survive the growing number of zombies and the millions of slithering worm-like creatures that carry the disease in order to hunt down the ""source"" of the infestation, Starla's husband Grant (Rooker), and terminate himbefore the disease spreads even further.""Slither"" is a slimy little piece of horror cinema that is just about as disgusting, putrid, and grimy as they come. In fact, it seems as though the filmmakers would think of something gross and then multiply it by ten. For example, the film features thousands of horribly grotesque worm-like creatures that infect the townspeople. However, not only do they infect people, they do so by sliding through the people's mouths. ""Slither"" pushes the very limitations of decency in almost every way possible. It's an offensive movie and yet it worksand it works far better than most other recent horror movies. ""Slither"" packs a punch, not because of its scares or its satirical humor, but because of the effective use of its gore. I can only wonder how this movie was passed by the MPAA with an ""R"" rating. Did they simply fall asleep halfway through the film and then wake up during the credits? Nathan Fillion and Elizabeth Banks lead an almost completely competent cast. Fillion, who is probably best known for his leading role in the TV series ""Firefly"" and its big-screen adaptation named ""Serenity"", is one of my favorite new actors. He just has a certain calmness and a coolness about him that draws the audience in. You can't help but to enjoy watching him. Banks brings class, respectability, and beauty to this dark and sickening movie. Her being in the film almost validates the excessive use of slime and gore. Tania Saulnier does a very nice job, especially considering that this is her first major role in a major movie. I totally believed her. Gregg Henry just really annoyed me and I kept hoping that his character would get it quickly and gruesomelyhe did, but not nearly soon enough. I really still don't understand what his character was supposed to be. Yes, he was the mayor, but why was he so annoying the entire movie? Was he supposed to be funny? ""Slither"" suffers from one huge problem and that is the lack of originality. I understood what they were attempting to do, but the movie could have definitely used some freshness. Almost every concept was borrowed from some other movie and, while I do know that this was really a satire of these movies, I still felt that ""Slither"" should have stood up and made a solid name for itself by introducing at least one truly original thought. ""Slither"" also has a few pacing problems, especially at the beginning. Cheesy B-movies are supposed to be fun and entertaining, but, for the first thirty minutes, I found myself yawning a little too often. But, overall, ""Slither"" is an effective horror comedy that, once it did actually get started, had me either laughing or screaming the entire time. Nice performances and effective uses of blood and gore all make this movie worth a watch.Final Thought: ""Slither"" is a nice throwback to the B-movies that most people have long forgotten, but where was the originality? Overall Rating: 7/10 (B+)",Slither
141,nzswanny,One of the best horror comedies I have ever seen,8,6 December 2015,"Not the best, but definitely in the top 10 list of my mind. What really made me enjoy this movie is that it didn't have too much gore, it didn't have too much jokes, it had the right amount of horror - it was perfect! I don't exactly like horror comedies when they are called horror comedies when pretty much there just comedies, but this was ACTUALLY both! Finally, after all these years, there has been another proper horror comedy! I do not enjoy comedies that are called horror comedies - they're stupid. However, this was awesome! I wish horror comedies were more like this!! My top 3 horror comedy movies is Dead Alive, Slither, and The Lost Boys! But that doesn't matter - however, Slither is my second favorite horror comedy, so that's something! It also has the right amount of gore - not too little, not too much. I quite liked Dead Alive which was very gory, but Slither is definitely better in my opinion. 8/10",Slither
142,Movieguy_blogs_com,This movie was a cross between 'Spaced Invaders' and 'The Puppet Masters'.,4,4 April 2006,"In 'Slither' Nathan Fillion (Serenity) plays Bill Pardy, a small-town sheriff. His home town is about to be overrun by aliens. He has to destroy the leader before they take over everything.This movie was a cross between 'Spaced Invaders' and 'The Puppet Masters'. It started out with a lot of potential, but was far too campy to be taken seriously. At the same time, it is a little too gruesome to be considered a scary comedy. I think this might have a hard time finding an audience. This will probably appeal to the fans of really bad, low-budget, horror flicks. If you like that sort of thing, keep an eye out for cameos by Lloyd Kaufman and Rob Zombie.There is a scene where they disclose some of the background on the aliens that I wished they would have expanded on. Overall, I was not a big fan.",Slither
143,manicman84,"solidly constructed, entertaining horror movie",7,25 August 2006,"Slither is a hilarious horror film strongly influenced by such great classics like: Braindead, Alien and Shaun of the Dead. The film is some kind of parody of horror flicks and uses a wide range of motives. The threat comes from outer space when meteor-like entity directs towards the Earth. It falls apart and a small cocoon gets to the small Southern American town. Soon the ordinary life of inhabitants will, to put it mildly, change for worse. As you can see, director/writer James Gunn uses many clichés so as to keep the story going. In fact, the construction of the plot is extremely similar to that of Peter Jackson Braindead. However, the pic is not so intense or powerful. Gunn cares about his characters who are well developed during the first half of the film. Then, he applies gradually suspense and a bizarre twist comes. The last part resembles classic zombie movie with numerous gory scenes as well as strong, disgusting monster. It sounds a bit like a B-movie from the 80s. Nevertheless, Slither is really well shot as Gunn seems to know the subject inside out. Moreover, a fair number of abstract, laughable situations occur throughout the entire flick. To sum up, Slither isn't really anything new, but it's a solidly constructed, entertaining movie that won't let you feel bored.",Slither
144,Pasafist,"if you like this kind of thing, a fast moving silly horror movie with a lot of gore than the film benefits from the cinematic experience.",6,12 April 2006,"I'm struck with the thought that with the proliferation of VCR's and DVD's the cinematic experience has been lost. We complain about people talking in the theater and peoples cell phones going off. But as I was sitting there in the theater watching SLITHER I dreamed of a time when cinema was about the audience, when people laughed at movies, screamed when things were scary, and I long for that time when going to the local theater was a collective experience, and not about total silence and good behavior.James Gunn's SLITHER is a throwback film. A horror comedy that feels like it was written in 1985 from a screenplay that was written in 1954. One night in a small West Virginia town a meteor falls to ground and an alien life-form is released from it's core. That alien infests a local man, and then through some amazingly gory special effects creates small slug like creatures that infest the local population and turns them into zombies. It's now up to the local sheriff, his childhood sweetheart, a foul-mouthed mayor, and a teenage girl to stop this menace from taking over the rest of the world.Trust me if you've seen NIGHT OF THE CREEPS, CRITTERS, or GHOULIES you've seen SLITHER. If you like that kind of thing then this is the movie for you. It's short, sweet, and too the point. You won't be gushing about how wonderful it is or anything, but as a diversion the movie works.The film jumps when it needs to jump. The characters while not very developed are alive enough that you care about them, and while the film need more laughs, it still winks back at you with its tongue firmly in cheek. You leave the movie not very fulfilled but satisfied.What would have helped the movie was some more humor, a ton more gore, and well just more. The first act just goes on and on, and the finale is really lackluster and breezes by an breakneck speed. I easily could have given this movie fifteen or twenty more minutes to build to something a lot more substantial. But alas it begins and ends without really paying off. What's there works, but with all the potential it had, the final showdown was so fast I felt a little cheated. For once I just wanted a little more.But if you like this kind of thing, a fast moving silly horror movie with a lot of gore than the film benefits from the cinematic experience. An audience that likes silly horror comedy's and gets the in jokes will make it more fun. The experience is also enhanced by the jokers who throw popcorn, and the teenage girl who screams after every jump scene. Alas that experience is probably few and far between in the modern multiplex but it would certainly help those who go see SLITHER.",Slither
145,Poe-17,Split Personality Review,7,26 October 2006,"We've been here a hundred times, but not all at once.Halfway through this I was really letdown (possibly a little pre-hype syndrome)then my whole mind set for the movie kind of gave in to gravity and everything wheeled into focus.I call these kind of films ""mosaic films"". They assemble various snips and plot pieces from various cinematic scary (sometimes horror) films and paste them into a ""new"" movie.This is, unfortunately, the technique of a lot of low budget entries; multiple movie copying. Lift the best from good films and hope it slips under the radar as another good film.It doesn't work with the unskilled. But with creativity and intentional parody, it can work. It isn't homage. It's feeding fans of the genre. It's like a bunch of fans sitting down and blabbering about their favorite films.It can be done seriously or steeped in the landscape of black humor (where it seems to work best - think ""Shaun of the Dead""). It can also be done slapstick style ala the ""Scary Movie"" franchise which hasn't done anything personally for me but is in sequel 4 or something like that.Slither does pull it off, not in stellar fashion, but it does pull it off. Kudos to those involved. Special Effects wander off into silly, which is okay because it is intentional (and fires off memories of the excellent movie from which it borrows).After you've watched it, it might be fun to watch it again with a clipboard and jot down the movies this or that scene reminds you of. It might be fun to have a contest for ""mosaic movies"" to see which one can borrow from the most films.If you like the genre, watch it. Just don't give the hype weight.",Slither
146,Ben-Hibburd,Slither Review.,5,1 November 2017,"Slither is written and directed by James Gunn. The film sees a midwest town become infected by alien worm creatures, that turn the townspeople into meat craving mutated 'zombies'. Influenced from classic 50's sci-fi such as: The Blob, The Thing etc, Slither is a horror comedy that's light on the horror and the comedy. With the talent in front and behind the camera I was expecting a-lot more.The standout performer in this film was by far Michael Rooker, as always he gives a charismatic over the top performance that lights up the screen. Especially when he stumbles across the creature that attaches itself to him, leading to him doing funny bizarre things. Nathan Fillion and Elizabeth Banks were also solid in their roles without leaving their comfort zones. Everybody in the film does a good job.I found it hard to rate this film, as this isn't a bad film but I found it un-engaging and tiresome to sit through. Technically speaking the film was well crafted. The practical effects and gore looked good, even if at times they resembled the left over props from The Thing. However I found this film to be tonally perplexing, the scary moments weren't scary enough. With the only effective scene coming from the bathtub sequence, but that was it. The comedic elements were also lacking I can't remember a scene (other then when a character loses a hand grenade) that even made me slightly chuckle. In the end this film ends up getting lost between the two elements, and that made for frustrating viewing.",Slither

148,hesketh27,How does junk like this find a distributor?,1,4 May 2006,"There must be literally hundreds of excellent films being made throughout the world every year and yet utter garbage like this is getting distributed in the UK. For some unknown reason the British press seems to be giving this stinker good reviews, which is why we decided to go and see it in the first place. The film is obviously trying be a tongue in cheek but unfortunately all it is is a charmless piece of junk. The script tries to throw in amusing one liners along the way, every one of which fell flat on its face. The whole audience sat throughout without so much as one ripple of amusement and we left feeling that we had both wasted our money and our time by going to see this. OK, I admit that I would probably have enjoyed the special effects when I was 13, but now I feel insulted being offered dross like this as entertainment. It really is time that a few more worthy films started being shown in British cinemas, alas, having seen the trailers for coming releases I fear that this will never be.... Our government is always banging on about the evils of eating junk food - perhaps they should start looking at the diet of trash that is being fed to the nation's minds - and believe me - they don't come any more worthless or trashier than this!",Slither
149,Mario64,Good horror-comedy.,7,14 August 2013,"Slither is one of the better examples of its kind from the last ten years or so, which may not say a whole lot because movies about ugly creepy crawly things that do disgusting things more often than not are not very pleasant to sit through; not to me anyway. But this one has enough humor, thrills and neat tricks to make it worth sitting through for non-hardcore horror fans, in spite of a somewhat weak ending.The basic setup is not a new one. Someone gets infected by a foreign thing that turns him into something very creepy, and then he in turn infects others and suddenly large numbers of people are no longer human and others have to survive and to try to put an end to it. But how it all goes about it is fascinatingly strange and there are some very tense sequences. Without giving too much away, there is an element involving all the movie's creatures all being linked in a certain way that does have some unique payoffs. It's disgusting, as one would expect for this kind of film, but it nicely balances the grossness with solid humor, some of the best which come from a guy who plays the incredible jerk of the mayor of the town in which the film is set.Unfortunately the finale is pretty standard for this kind of film and didn't really thrill me. The actors are serviceable for their roles, but nothing much more than that. But overall it's a frightening, funny, and twistedly-sick good time most of the way, for those in the mood for this kind of thing. By B horror film standards it's one of the best modern ones I've seen.",Slither

Plot development is kept to a minimum to pave the way for a slew of typically cliché horror flick characters, a traditional small town setting and some very tongue in cheek humour. The overall effect is a nostalgic trip through the ever changing socially conscious horror canon, drawing inspiration and paying respect to, in particular, Herschell Gordon Lewis, Romero's Living Dead trilogy, John Carpenter's The Thing and Cronenberg's 1975 debut Shivers and his subsequent body horror's of the 1980's. Although ideally aimed at true horror fans, there is plenty in here to keep more universal viewers entertained, albeit ones with a soft spot for gruesome effects.7/10",Slither

James Gunn's directorial debut has the feel of old classic horror movies with repulsive makeup effects and silly (which is intelligent) humor. We see Nathan Fillion fighting an alien invasion that converts people into giant squids and King-sized beach balls.It wanted to be the ""sickest movie ever made"".

154,LadyLiberty,Slither Surprisingly Good,7,2 April 2006,"Slither Like every other red-blooded pro-freedom woman, I fell just a little in love with Nathan Fillion who starred as Captain Malcolm Reynolds in the wonderful (and sadly defunct) Firefly TV series as well as the strongly libertarian (and very good) movie, Serenity. If Fillion was in it, I was going to go see it, dammit, even if it was a really stupid horror movie! Imagine, then, my surprise when I started hearing some decent reviews. And imagine my even greater surprise to find that I agreed with those reviews! Billed as a science fiction horror comedy movie, Slither starts with a few minutes of all three. Wheelsy, West Virginia police Chief Bill Pardy (Nathan Fillion) is at a local speed trap with one of his officers when a meteor flames overhead. Too busy discussing other ""important"" things, the pair don't see it streaking across the sky, nor do they notice it crash landing nearby. The rest of us, however, are right on top of the smoking meteorite when it splits open and begins to disgorge its slimy contents.Meanwhile, pretty school teacher Starla Grant (Elizabeth Banks) is fending off advances from her much older husband, Grant Grant (Michael Rooker). In a fit of pique, Grant leaves his wife alone in their bed as he heads in to town to have a drink. At the bar, he runs into local bad girl, Brenda Gutierrez (Brenda James) who confesses she's always had a crush on him. Tipsy, the two leave together and head into the woods.It doesn't require any psychic abilities to guess what happens next. Grant and Brenda find the cooled meteorite and, just sober enough to be curious, Grant follows the trail of slime that leads away from the site. Unfortunately, his curiosity is satisfied, and he ends up going home just a little the worse for wear.In a matter of days, Starla learns things about her husband she never could have imagined, and Brenda gets far more from Grant than she ever considered in her wildest dreams  or nightmares. Meanwhile, Chief Pardy is looking in Grant's direction as he rapidly becomes the prime suspect in a series of local crimes.All of the action is set amidst the excitement of the opening of deer hunting season. Mayor Jack MacReady (Gregg Henry) is right in the thick of things where deer hunting season is concerned, and he's bound and determined to be there for a hunt for anything else as well. Given the quality of the rest of Pardy's police force (and support staff), it's sad to say MacReady is going to fit right in...For those who are enamored with Serenity's Captain Reynolds, Nathan Fillion's character here has some of the Captain in him (something I'm beginning to think probably has almost as much to do with Fillion is it does with the script). Elizabeth Banks does a fine job of being a pretty blonde girl who might be just a little bit stronger than people might have believed, and Michael Rooker offers up a portrayal of a man we'd really like to dislike, but who shows just enough of a hint of heart that he's impossible to wholly condemn. Meanwhile Tania Saulnier, Jennifer Copping, and Jenna Fisher are fine in supporting roles.It's impossible not to make special mention of Gregg Henry's Mayor MacReady who is, in simple terms, a hoot thanks to some excellent one-liners written for him and a terrific ability to deliver them with wild-eyed conviction.The screenplay which was written by the movie's director, James Gunn, is impressive. In the wrong hands, this idea could have become slapstick or stupid. Instead, it's often suspenseful, occasionally startling, and almost non-stop funny. Good for him! Some movies take themselves far too seriously and, as a result, can be unintentionally laughable. Slither, on the other hand, includes good acting, quality cinematography, decent special effects, and effective direction. Yet the fact that it does take itself maybe just a little seriously actually adds to the overall effect of the film.I had a great time, and while the friend I saw the movie with didn't like it quite as much as I did, it probably says something that we were quoting lines from the film and laughing ourselves silly long after we'd left the theatre for other venues. (Incidentally, for all of her not liking it as much as I did, my movie ""date"" was on the phone and recommending it to others in short order after we left.) I recommend Slither wholeheartedly for any and all comers who like to see a movie on occasion that demands absolutely nothing from the audience but that it be entertained. It will, at the very least, do that much.FAMILY SUITABILITY: Slither is rated R for ""strong horror violence and gore, and language."" While far from suitable to the littlest children, I think the R-rating is a bit harsh especially since there's plenty here to amuse the average teen, none of which includes overt sex or any nudity. I'd suggest that, as long as the child in question isn't particularly squeamish, 14 or 15 is plenty old enough to see and enjoy Slither. Meanwhile, grown-ups who aren't afraid to kick back and laugh should be able to do so here. While some in the audience seemed more bemused than amused, that wasn't at all true for me and my friend.",Slither

Basically it's about this meteorite from outer space that lands in the woods of a small American town, and it gets discovered by a man called Grant (Rooker), he pokes at it and an alien parasite shoots out and worms it's way into his body and takes him over, and from there other people start getting possessed by these alien slugs that enter through their mouths, turning them all into zombified aliens.It's up to a police Chief, Grant's wife Starla and a young girl to save their town and the world from becoming a breeding zone for these nasty slimy aliens!!!

Shades of Invasion of the Body Snatchers (heck, which version?), the list goes on.I enjoyed it but funny enough, I didn't go crazy with excitement seeing it.

There's lots of humor in Slither but humor isn't the point. I guess it's just there isn't so much outrageousness here. It's actually quite conventional at heart. You might say Tremors is even more conventional than Slither, but maybe that's the appeal. Tremors is about folksy cowboys on a wagon train to California...chased by underground monsters from hell.I'd like to give Slithers more points for being quite good(as opposed to execrable like a lot of badly done horror flicks nowadays) but I just can't make myself.

159,walkingwithprimeval,James Gunn's career before doing family-friendly Marvel movies,8,10 June 2020,"It's a graphically-explicit body-horror gore-fest extravaganza with a sick sense of twisted dark humour, the sincere kind which only James Gunn could pull-off (given Gunn's history with his mentor Lloyd Kaufman over at Troma Entertainment, I'd say he learnt from the best). It was basically like my generation's version of John Carpenter's The Thing (1982) remake, just with the little added mixture of having both CGI visuals and practical animatronics merged altogether in the same shots to help make the effects blend more seamlessly (much in the same exact way that Steven Spielberg made the original Jurassic Park).This film is a more contemporary take on the classic creature features that positively thrived during the ""Atomic Age"" of '50s cinema, where there was always some sort of monster on the loose and wreaking havoc upon a quiet little urban area of town. The movie does a fairly decent job at building up suspense throughout the First Act, with Michael Rooker giving a marvellously creepy performance as the hideously zombified human host of an intergalactic slug-creature infestation (although personally, I've always seen them as being more worm-like than anything).The rest of the film's cast all turn in equally good performances as well - from Elizabeth Banks being the concerned wife, to Nathan Fillion as the protective police officer - its pretty good stuff. But by far, the funniest character in this whole movie's alien-parasite ordeal has to be the town's mayor (eccentrically played by Gregg Henry) who's always spewing out vulgar swear words left and right, and some of it's said at completely random and inappropriate times, like in the immediate aftermath of when a serious scene has just taken place, all for the sake of interjecting a bit of levity (that must be one heck of a wicked mood swing he's got!).I was pleasantly pleased with the music selection for the film, as it perfectly strikes up the unique tonal balance of having a normal mundane sensibility about itself whilst simultaneously being overlapped with a gruesome amount of horrific gross-out set-pieces. From the opening sequence to the end credits, the movie's song choices really helped to show a good contrast between the impoverished everyday setting of a gloomy old, run-down town in the American countryside and the more repulsive ""shock-value"" moments of very, very messed-up dark comedy which definitely pushes some boundaries here and there.It's such a shame that when this now-cult classic was first released, it never got the full recognition it so rightfully deserved. I guess back then in the 2000s, people just weren't as used to seeing a whole lot of pure ""horror-comedies"" anymore, which were all the rage in the '80s (and by the way, Edgar Wright's Shaun of the Dead doesn't count, as it's meant to be a straight up parody of the genre).When all's said and done, Slither is a disgustingly grotesque delight that'll be sure to keep any self-respecting gore-hungry horror-fanatic satisfied. If anything, it's worth watching just to see where James Gunn got his early start at directing (long before he became famously known for making his Guardians of the Galaxy film series over at Marvel Studios).",Slither

Gregg Henry delivers a perfectly smarmy take as the mayor of this tiny town, full of fake smiles and bonhomie one moment, of very real pettiness and terror the next.

It's unexpected because Fillion's character clearly has the hots for Rooker's wife, who married him when she was young, and you expect from the first reel that this guy's going to turn out to be some kind of abusive jerk. But he isn't. He seems to honestly love her, which plays havoc with all the expectations we have for the character, and makes his ultimate fate as the host of the alien slugs a lot more horrible than it would have been had the character simply been the pure jerk cliché demanded.And that's where Slither really shines: it plays merry hob with the clichés of both comedy and horror, but manages to get the best of both. Slapstick comedy relies on making fun of someone, but in some of the most obvious pratfalls in this movie, people die who shouldn't. Horror relies on the intrusion of the unreal into the real, but the monsters, in this movie, are rendered with a kind of practical flatness (the camera is not at all shy about revealing the bad guys or their victims) that makes it somehow even worse. Witty humor is usually put in the mouths of the smartest characters, to make fun of the hicks, but in this movie the hicks have all the best lines.Kudos to the filmmakers for rising to the occasion in a way few movies of such mixed genres can manage. Here's hoping they manage even more in the future.Grade: A",Slither

Unfortunately the director is not shy and while in the beginning all that ugliness was inventive and bold and works great, in the end is just too much and too repetitive. Instead He should've concentrate more on the two main characters and their renewed blooming romance keeping the feet on ground.However this is a good movie with a good basis for a great horror, but missing few ingredients in the end that would have made it excellent.",Slither
163,brodie_kashmir,"Gross, creepy, funny, and good times had by all (aside from the pukers)",8,10 July 2006,"Schlock horror films are as American as baseball and apple pie, and with horror films being the only genre that is easily bankable these days, it's no surprise Universal Studios turns to ""Dawn of the Dead"" scribe and Troma Films alumni James Gunn to helm the latest fright offering, ""Slither.""Slither"" is a successful fusion of two different horror sub-genres: aliens and zombies. First the aliens come down and start taking over the world, starting with a rich man in a hick town, Grant Grant (Michael Rooker, and yes, that is his character's full name). He becomes the ""parent"" of sorts to the rest of the alien slugs that take over the town. Then, the aliens turn the townspeople into bloodthirsty zombies, eating any sort of living flesh they can get their hands on. The town's only hopes for survival are on Police Chief Bill Pardy (Nathan Fillion) and Grant's love for his young wife, Starla (Elizabeth Banks).It would take multiple viewings, a notebook and a film encyclopedia to catch all of the references and homages contained in ""Slither,"" but some of the more notable and obvious ones include ""Alien,"" George A. Romero's ""Living Dead"" films, ""The Thing,"" ""Evil Dead,"" and ""Night of the Creeps."" The cast is populated by no big stars, but identifiable faces. Fillion is the most identifiable. Coming off of last year's ""Serenity,"" his rising star is following much the same path as cult icon Bruce Campbell. Rooker, known best as Mr. Svenning in ""Mallrats,"" hams it up as the utterly grotesque uber-slug. Banks, in her biggest role to date, following minor roles in both ""Spider-Man"" films and ""The 40 Year Old Virgin,"" transforms into an undeniably appealing scream queen. Jamie Lee Curtis, the queen-iest of them all, would be very proud.Gunn, while not matching the cool or scare factor he had with his ""Dawn of the Dead"" script in 2004, still puts together a funny and tight script that seems to come right out of a Sam Raimi mold. The scares to give you a good jump every now and then are there. The jokes are there to remind you that the whole thing is done with tongue planted firmly in cheek. The ""ick"" factor that makes you want to vomit is there.This film is not for the squeamish. It just isn't. And even the strong stomached out there should probably bring a bucket or a large cup, or just refrain from eating for a few hours before hand. When Starla walks down into the formerly locked basement where the transformed Grant had been keeping his food, which is nothing more than raw meat and the neighbor's dog, you just can't look. And the sound of flies buzzing, oh man, that's just not right.Unfortunately, like most horror films (especially modern ones), this one has no real social redeeming value. It's pure escapism at its best. The shelf life of afterthoughts on ""Slither"" clock in at an hour tops, unless you try really hard. It fails to have any of the social commentary that Romero's films (racism, consumerism) or John Carpenter's films (sexism) or even some of Wes Craven's films (parental intimidation) had. While it works as a visual homage to their films, the concepts (or lack there of) fail to match up with those it's trying to emulate. The closest it comes to any kind of commentary is the addressing of the sanctity of marriage, and even that's stretching it.",Slither

Well made, well written, well acted... but I just didn't get the jokes i guess.The art of parody is delicate - Shaun of the dead went over the top and it worked well - some other movies tried the same formula and just bombed. Slither does parody but with such professionalism that it just doesn't work. FX are perfect, in fact, they're not cheesy enough. The same for the acting - it seems the actors didn't want to look silly, so they acted as best as they could and the end result is great - but lacks cheese...Finally, the movie feels like an episode from Buffy the vampire slayer. The story is nuts but the whole product is so well made that you wonder if the director forgot he was doing a parody.Still, it's worth the price of the ticket - unlike Ultraviolet, which is a piece of... crap (i HAD to say it :-)",Slither

To me, he is an up and coming actor and a good choice to take over the Indiana Jones series. I hope he does not take more roles like the forthcoming White Noise 2.Elizabeth Banks is always a scene stealer. She positively glowed in Seabiscuit and here she is again, lighting up the screen. Another actress who deserves her due.The rest of the cast is stellar with vets Michael Rooker and Gregg Henry joining the ensemble, providing lots of tongue and cheek humor.

Not 'screaming with laughter' but screaming AND laughing, simultaneously. That's pretty good, I can't say I've ever done that before.The script is pretty good, no loose ends.

168,dimarinc,An Instant Classic; Equal Parts Gory and Funny,8,11 April 2012,"Slither is a very watchable movie. I am an eternal fan of the horror/comedy genre. It makes horror movies more accessible to a wider audience. That being said, it is very difficult to make movies like the popular Shaun of the Dead, and the less popular Infestation. But you can add Slither to that elite group that not only pulls off both genres, but excels. Slither is an alien invasion movie about a particularly interesting survival/destruction strategy. The best part Slither is how it can borderline on the edge of sci-fi even though it pulls of horror and comedy so well. The CGI is impressive in this movie. Elizabeth Banks and Nathan Fillion carry this movie and the acting is serviceable. The fact that Nathan Fillion brings that gentle bravado and light hearted quality lends itself well to a movie that moves at a fast pace.The only things you may hate about this movie are the accents and the pace. It is a southern based movie, so some of the non southern actors attempts at southern accents might be construed negatively. Lastly, the movie moves quickly and doesn't focus on anything too long. Maybe lengthening the movie a bit could've allieveated this, but the movie is good enough as is.I would recommend this movie to everyone, except those who hate worms.",Slither

No overblown cinematography, no dark blueish color tones, no pseudo psycho plot twists to ""unforeseen"" surprises, no paranormal activity sh-it. It's pukey, mucosanguineous and its naive brutality seems to originate from a wet Beavis and Butt-Head fantasy after having too much beers. So it's sarcastically funny and very effective by putting the quite obscene horror directly in your face, there no room for your fantasy, either you like it, or you find it disgusting. If you watch it with other people it's getting even more funny when some start to get upset about the nastiness of some scenes. A gem of the genre, not only for insiders.",Slither
170,carlykristen,"An okay horror-comedy, but for a classic, stick with The Blob",6,15 February 2007,"A meteorite collides in a small town where Grant finds it, becomes infected by a parasite worm, and causes him to transform into a monster. His wife Starla and a policeman, Bill, will try to stop him and the plague of worms generated by the creature. Zombies join the picture.Grant strikes me as a grody fellow flicking his wife's nipples at a lame attempt to ""turn her on"" like a light switch. And policeman Bill isn't any better. He is overbearing and rude. When Starla sweetly tells him to be careful and stares longingly at him waiting for his reply, he brusquely says, ""Yeah, now there's a thought."" Starla had dreams to move to LA and frankly I think she had a better chance dealing with the sharks there. Screw these hillbilly jerks.Also, the subplot of the Sheriff lusting after Starla was underdeveloped. I didn't feel a connection between them at all and love developing there seems unbelievable. A simple flashback to them at an earlier age could have helped to fix that. Or, you know, he could have pretended to like her in a heterosexual type of way.Call me crazy, but there were weird sexual undertones that I do not understand. There is talk of Survival of the Fittest during the film and I couldn't help, but think this was referring to the men and women on screen. There is the preacher hammering on about God eating fishes while Grant preyed on a lonely woman. And then there was the zombie dude who accusingly asked Starla, ""How could you blame someone for acting their nature?"" as though this is explanation enough for her horny husbands cheating ways.The three main women are playing stereotypes- the gold-digger, frigid wife, the trailer trash single mom desperate for attention, and the 16yo naughty girl with painted nails in the nipple-flashing bathtub scene. Oh and the 2 tentacle, double penetration rape scene was oddly exploitive for such a mainstream movie.Now, don't get me wrong. Slither is not a terrible film. But I am deeply disappointed after hearing the nonstop hype about the ""Best Horror Movie of 2006"". I felt overall it lacked in gore considering the lengthy articles Fangoria wrote on how they ran out of SFX supplies because it is just that darn gory. And the story was not original. It was part The Blob, part Shivers. And I really disliked the how the female characters were portrayed. But hey, other than that it was a fun film.By now you should know who James Gunn is. He wrote ""Tromeo & Juliet"" ""Scooby Doo 1-2,"" and ""Dawn of the Dead."" I think he has strong skills as a writer, however, Slither suffered in the writing area probably because Gunn also takes over as director here. Tromeo was well written and had several likable characters and I bet it had less than half the budget Slither did.Presented in Dolby Digital 5.1 with a running time of 96 minutes. The SFX were okay, but I heard that they used mostly real props and make-up to create the effects, but about 80% looked like fake CGI.Trivia: Lloyd Kaufman, James Gunn, and his real life wife Jenna Fischer all make appearances. Kaufman had lines, but they were cut.(Read Molly's Interview W/Lloyd Here) Favorite Quote: Kid asks, ""What's a 'gina'?"" Sheriff replies, ""It's a country. You know, where ""Ginese"" people come from."" DVD Extras: Making of, Deleted Scenes, Commentary, Gag Reel, and Slithery set tour.Bottom Line: An okay horror-comedy, but if you are interested in a classic, stick with The Blob. And if you want exploitation fun, try Cronenberg's Shivers.Rating: 6.5/10by Molly Celaschi www.HorrorYearbook.com",Slither
171,sackjigler,Just a lot of fun,8,31 March 2006,"You know right off the bat by watching the previews of this movie if you will enjoy it. If the previews look good to you, go see it. If not, steer clear. I just came out of this movie today from a theater with about 10 people in it, 2 of whom walked out 10 minutes into it, and i couldn't be happier. Its nice once in a while to see a movie that obviously is not serious and just tries to allow the audience to have a good time. The cast works well together, not taking anything seriously, and the movie is short and to the point, unlike some movies that are over-hyped ala King Kong. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed that film to, but sometimes there is just too much put into movies. Anyway, I enjoyed this one especially because it wasn't like the sick and sadistic, just trying to shock and disgust you horror movies of today like saw 2 and hostel. Personally for me, it's better when its not realistic so you can enjoy watching the people die, and trust me, plenty do. In summary, if you like such movies as Evil Dead 2 and Army of Darkness, or Dead Alive, the basic horror comedy that everyone has come to know and love, than this should be right up your alley.

175,endymion82,Fun Little Film in the Comedic Horror Tradition,9,18 April 2006,"I'm surprised this movie hasn't done better at the box office, and yet I'm really not that surprised: good horror, let alone good horror/comedy, is probably lost on most of America's teenagers, and that seems to be the only crowd that goes to movies these days- how else do you justify the terrible remake of THE FOGG? Still, this movie is so fun I would have imagined that it could have found a broader audience, though maybe some people can't get past the slithery monsters and copious stage blood. Certainly I'm glad I can, because I was really entertained and even fairly impressed with the writing and character work- so many modern films, let alone horror movies, seem to have forgotten that any story begins with its characters; thankfully this one didn't. Elizabeth Banks and Nathan Fillon are great as the hero and heroine, if only because she plays everything with such utter sincerity and you genuinely like her, and he provides enough of a jaded contrast that you find yourself relating to him, almost as if he was designed to be the audiences ""in"" to the strange events of the movie. Kudos to the writers for providing two very strong female characters and also for the token lesbian whose sexuality is handled in such a subdued, off-hand manner it's almost miss-able and thus becomes that rarity in Hollywood: an incidental gay character who isn't a total stereotype.

178,smccar77,"A ""B"" movie that gives an ""A"" experience",7,9 February 2011,"""Slither"" is a mixed genre film. The movie is an amusing assembly of Alien, Zombie, and Comedy devices. Being an adulterated mix, the film never does plumb the depths of any of its composite genres. That said, the film is a measured and enjoyable addition to all of the types of genres it uses. This movie is not a masterpiece, nor did it ever intend to be one. ""Slither"" is a great example of a ""B"" film that makes modest claims and delivers on those claims in a clever and fulfilling way. When all is said and done, ""Slither"" is a highly enjoyable film directed at low budget horror fans that enjoy watching several genre stereotypes be lovingly mocked.Before making any arguments of my own, a dollop of explanatory context is in order. A film does have several aspects which can be judged fairly objectively. For example, a majority of viewers will both notice and comment on the difference between the film quality of a $100 video camera and a professional grade 35 mm camera. Not only that, a majority of viewers will more than likely find the experience of watching the 35 mm footage more appealing. This is not to say that cheap video is grossly inferior to film. The point of this argument is that certain qualities of film making and acting are easily identified as being of higher or lower quality. In addition, while I maintain that quality of the production is available for objective criticism, this in no way implies that enjoyment of the film is reliant on afore mentioned production quality.The above context stated, ""Slither"" is a wonderfully enjoyable film that is an average production. As in many current films, CGI is used to fill in scenes with creepy and fantastic images. Also like many current films, the CGI is not the highest quality. The CGI effects of ""Slither"" are hit or miss at best. While a few do add some wonderful senses of ""gross"" or ""wow!"" a great many appear as what they are, cheap CGI.The only other fault I want to discuss is pacing. The film really does begin on a whimper and end in a bang. It could be argued that the film is trying to build momentum and then truly shock the audience with the last 45 minutes of non-stop action. However, ""Slither"" would have a hard time defending such an argument. The film does do a good deal of fact and detail establishment in the first half, yet it does so in an almost action-less way. So much action is implied, that when the results of these implied actions are revealed, the audience is left with an underwhelmed feeling.Even with the above faults, this is a very fun film. The dialogue and acting are well done and show a clever understanding of the genres being used. For example, each and every character is a well known stock type. The actors and actresses actually embrace their two-dimensionality and exploit it to the fullest. Both the scriptwriter and actors are clearly on the same page for the direction of this film. Had the goal been a rich character drama set in a macabre science fiction world, this film would have been a complete failure. As a light hearted roast of alien/horror/comedy forbearers, this film is perfectly on the mark.How is it on the mark? First of all, it includes all of the genre standard strange logic. The alien invader comes to Earth. The authorities obviously have no procedures for such a unique event. So, do they call in experts from a range of government agencies and schools to help diagnose the problem and solve it? Absolutely not, the law officers and townspeople attempt to kill an unknown enemy on their own. Second, the ancient alien seems able to empathize with humanity. How do we as audience justify such an odd assertion? We don't. The film is all the more fun as long as one does not try to rationalize alien behavior and analyze it with philosophical or psychological tools. This movie is a low budget comedy horror, any aspirations to cinema defining greatness went out the door at this films inception. What developed, however, is a smartly acted, cleverly scripted, and competently produced escape from reality. In a world that makes multiple demands on a person, this is a wonderful self-indulgent 90 minutes of fun.On a personal note, I will be recommending this film to friends. There is something about this film that lends itself to friends, beer, and a few slices of pizza. 6.5 stars.",Slither
179,worthythorn24,A decent job of paying homage to the 80s gore fest.,6,31 March 2006,"Slither has been compared to Shivers, Night of the Creeps, Slugs and just about every other film where those creepy crawlers try to take over the world. Won't mutant slugs from outer space ever learn? Here it is 2006 and they're at it again, this time traveling to earth aboard an asteroid. Anyway, on to the review.While two country bumpkin sheriffs are debating over how fast birds can fly, an asteroid lands in the woods behind their car. Soon after we are introduced to Grant Grant (Michael Rooker) and his lovely young wife Starla (Elizabeth Banks). Apparently, Starla married Grant for his money but they appear to actually be in love with each other, much to the surprise of the local community. One evening after having his sexual advances warded off by Starla, Grant goes into town and meets a woman at a bar. They go off into the woods to get to know one another a little bit better when grant stumbles across what appears to be a gigantic larvae. When he approaches it (of course he doesn't just choose discretion as the better part of valor) the thing double probes him in the solar plexus and injects him with some sort of alien life form. After a few days, Grant begins acting strangely. By strangely I mean ordering up a truckload of meat from the butcher shop and abducting animals. Later in addition to abducting animals, Grant comes back for the young lady he spent the evening with and rapes her. You can pretty much guess what happens from there, right? Wrong! Well, maybe. This movie is pretty unpredictable at times and that made it pretty interesting to watch. Later on in the film, the alien (or are they Martian?) slugs possess the bodies of anyone unfortunate enough to ingest one and they can have their mind and body controlled by Grant. It's up to a few select townspeople to try and stop ""Grant"" from taking over the planet! The best thing about this film in my opinion was how it pays homage to the over the top gore fests of the 1980s. What a decade that was for horror. You can see this film borrows from such classics as Reanimator, Night of the Creeps, Waxwork, Evil Dead, The Fly and Basket Case to name a few. There's even a scene where a family is watching the Toxic Avenger! However, even with all those movies being referenced I still felt like they tried a little bit too hard. It would definitely be a great movie to watch after you've had a few too many! There were truly disgusting moments when I had to turn my head and just wonder who thinks of this stuff? Thankfully, the tone is very tongue in cheek and shows this movie is NOT to be taken seriously. The TV spots try to portray this as straight up horror but it really isn't.

It was like the movie just woke up from its stupor and went totally for it.

I can see how some people might think it's a good ""B"" movie and I might watch it on cable, but it's nothing I would spend money on again.",Slither
184,dogsrus-1,Pretty darn good :),7,2 April 2006,"After some really bad movies last year and this year, I was happy to sit down, relax and have a really good time watching Slither. I gave it a seven star rating(my friend and boyfriend gave it a strong 6 stars). I laughed, jumped out of my seat a few times(I'm a pretty easy scare)and goggled at the ideas and special effects(which were good, not great, but moving at the moment). The other people around us also seemed to be having fun. This movie is a upgraded ""B"" movie. It won't move mountains, but it will provide entertainment. I couldn't pick out anything I'd change. My friend liked that it had ""gore"" but not ""gore over-kill"". My boyfriend, who liked it well enough still wished for dialog that was A ""bit more clever"".",Slither
185,Ton_O,James Gunn is a good influence in Hollywood.,9,20 October 2006,"James Gunn is a genius in scriptwriting, and he is a very rare species of people making it in the Hollywood scene without selling out. His scripts always show his true sense of humor and cynicism. He always puts a lot of Troma in there. Before Directing and writing Slither he wrote a number of highly successful theatrical hits, and he managed to make even Scooby Doo highly enjoyable and even did the impossible by writing an absolutely amazing script for the remake of absolute classic amongst classics of horror-films Dawn of the Dead - something me and many others always thought of as being totally impossible. However brilliant, none of Gunn's scripts, including Slither, although it comes close, are as GENIUS as the first one he ever wrote to be made in a film: Tromeo and Juliet, directed by Lloyd Kaufman (with Gunn as assistant director). Although not selling out, is it clear that all films for larger studio's need some concessions here and there, while Tromeo and Juliet has none of that, and truly shows Gunns genius without any restrictions (and it is, incidentally available on a tenth anniversary double disc, with huge contributions of James Gunn himself!!). All this said I can only conclude that Slither is a fantastic film, with a script as good as or maybe even better than his DAWN remake, and with it James Gunn shows he is perfect for directing his own work, because the film as a whole is far better than DAWN. An absolute must see, must have.The DVD also includes a very enjoyable video diary by independent film-legend Lloyd Kaufman, who has a cameo in Slither.",Slither
186,ernesto-garcia,A Genuine Review of Slither,9,8 February 2013,"Slither is a 2006 Horror Comedy film written and directed by James Gunn.So Slither is pretty much a giant homage to the Creature Features of the 50s and the Splatter Flicks of the 80s. Slither is about a meteor that crashes in a small town and infects one of the town folks with a strange needle like alien bug. What ensues is carnage,mayhem,and gross out comedy. The only problem I have with slither is that it has been done many many times before. Slither excels due to the director and the cast mainly.See this flick if you like splatter movies that are awesome and bloody.Skip this if you are easily grossed out and hate the films that this movie is paying homage to. 8.5/10",Slither
187,tricksixxx,"The brilliance of ""Slither""",8,1 April 2006,"""Slither"" is a truly dedicated motion picture. The reason it is so brilliant is simple; it combines every great horror moment ever told into a mix of its own story and outrageous humor. It's truly one in a million. I haven't been so intrigued by a horror film since Saw. Don't get me wrong, I like torture crazed features like Hostel, but Slither is actually a really funny movie mixed with the right spice of horror. Nowadays horror movies have done just about everything you can think about and most of them are just bland and clichéd. Slither simply takes all those clichés and jam them up into it's own new story, and that's why its awe-inspiring to watch. I will admit to you my fair reader, I am a horror movie fan. I take my pick of horror movies that look half way decent and well produced and generally am not disappointed. This year's Last House on the Left, and Hostel were especially entertaining, but not like the film I type this review for. This is the movie for every horror fan of my generation. It's got CGI, a list of well known actors, monsters, bugs, acid, people being split in half, it's got it all brothers and sisters and I encourage you to view this movie if you remain a fan of the somewhat dying horror genre. Filmmakers please make more movies like the Saw duo and Slither, I promise you that you're faithful viewers have not betrayed you! They simply lie dormant within the bulks of corporate walkers and talkers and teenagers looking for a thrill. We are out here, please stop making this PG-13 lying garbage that promises to show us what we bought the f****** ticket for and gives us 25 year old teenagers being off camera slaughtered and tricky camera angles to make us think we are being frightened....IT'S NOT WORKING!!!!! STAY ALIVE IS AWFUL ALONG WITH THE MAJORITY OF THE NONSENSE BEING MADE......Please just stick to great horror like Slither and keep your target base satisfied before your target base becomes nothing more than date movie theater annoyances who don't pay attention to anything but their 15 year old blondie sitting next to them giggling. OK OK I'm sorry I got off on a rant....Anyways Slither is a really great film and well worth admission price. 8/10",Slither
188,fx_gent,"Creepy & funny, but doesn't live up to its full potential.",7,2 April 2006,"Anyone who saw the trailer for this film, raise their hand if they were not immediately reminded of ""Night of the Creeps?"" As such, my first thought was whether this was another poor rip-off, err.. retelling, of a classic horror film. I was pleased that it did try to perform on its own, just borrowing elements from other films. None the less, a film that should have done better, given the premise, fell somewhat flat in its performance. The film spends a great deal of time building up to the first appearance of the worms, then quickly sprints to the conclusion. I would have deferred to have seen approximately the same amount of time spent covering each area. It is not to say, that this film did have its certain charms. There were some genuine moments of both creepiness and hilarity throughout. I thought that Gregg Henry definitely stole the show when he appeared as Mayor MacReady, especially his tirade for a soda. Overall, is it a bad film? Not really. It definitely could have been better, judge for yourself.",Slither
189,arabesuku,Definitely worth a watch.,8,23 October 2006,"If you're a fan of the old B-movies, then this one is definitely for you. If not, it's still worth a watch.Like an American version of 'Shaun Of The Dead' (2004), this film cleverly combines horror, gore and humour in order to scare its audience but keep them laughing. There are some clever lines within the film, in terms of comedy, that will raise a roar of laughter. In terms of horror, there are many scenes that made me squirm (*is a bit squeamish*)! There is a scene with a girl's family all turning into these monster creatures and one of the little sisters is particular terrifying...Anyway, I give this an 8/10. The acting, horror and comedy all work very well together. A bit of a gore fest for all you blood fans. A bit of sci-fi for all the alien lovers and a bit of zombies for all the George A. Romero groupies.Gotta love it.",Slither
190,JonTMarin816,"Decent popcorn flick, but not that impressive",5,1 April 2006,"Universal's new offering Slither wasn't something that I was really looking forward to, but it was everything that I'd expected. It's the ultimate B-movie with horror and comedy included. There are scenes in Slither that made me laugh a bit and squirm a bit but it wasn't anything to impress me. I understand that it isn't meant to be taken as a real horror flick but I left wanting to see more. It's a decent Friday night popcorn flick but nothing that'll really make an impact on you. At the end, Slither is a bit of a mixed bag for me. The humor can be funny at times but get downright corny and as for the horror, there's nothing here that's going to scare you but the slimy creatures may make you squirm.Slither - ** out of ****",Slither
191,themightyservo,"Surprisingly Meh, Keep Your Brain Turned Off",5,25 October 2019,"Loving reviews seem to be much closer to the release date, and I'm guessing the film had some initial enthusiasm.I found this as part of a DVD 4 pack along with a couple better movies. Watched it with no setup, no knowledge of anyone or anything associated with the film itself, and it didn't really do much for me.It seems derivative rather than creative, less an homage than just recycling, and the whole time I kept thinking about how this reminded me of ""The Giant Spider Invasion"" with victim characters who are frequently unsympathetic, a movie that mocks its victims just enough to make you not really care, and some horror elements that can't quite decide if they're funny or not.What initially tipped me to it was having Nathan Fillon's sheriff character voice contempt for the people who ostensibly voted for him at the bizarre over-the-top town deer hunt celebration. It was an odd choice, unless it's setting up some kind of ""these people are all bad and deserve it because animals are nice"" idea which is so weird. If he were the outsider reporter kind of character who voices that kind of view, it would make sense, would allow for him to mock people, would make scenes later funnier, would work, but it's just... odd. It sets up contempt for townies getting killed on a faulty moral basis, which isn't really horror anymore, it's more a kind of gore fetish thing, but in an odd way.It breaks connection with characters on one side or the other and makes them less sympathetic, which means you're just here to watch them get killed, which is its own thing, but it can't balance the act as it tries to be serious a few times.The practical effects are great, the CGI effects are adequate. CGI in horror almost always looks inferior to practical effects, so that's not a harsh criticism. There are a few interesting body horror visuals. There are a few scenes that are good, but overall it didn't do much for me.I kept thinking of things like Tremors, Squirm, and other great and bad horror movies and overall was just underwhelmed with Slither.If it were lower budget and messier, it would have worked better, but actually taking a Troma movie and making it high budget doesn't translate well.",Slither
192,memery-1,Better than most contemporary horror flicks,7,24 March 2008,"I am not a fan of the trendy torture-shock flicks like ""Hostel"" or ""Saw."" This kind of film is far more entertaining yet still pretty gross. Many of the plot points are pretty derivative of previous shockers like ""The Faculty,"" ""Night of the Creeps,"" ""The Thing,"" etc. It's a nice, fast-paced gross-out horror flick. Not for the weak of stomach, ""Slither"" does rely too much on gore, but the tone is actually much lighter than so many other 21st century horror films. The comedy segments are well balanced with the film's disturbing elements, but seeing decapitated dogs takes away from the fun. Michael Rooker is definitely creepy as the old rich guy with a young wife, and equally weird is the use of Air Supply (!) during a love scene. This isn't a classic, but worth a late night cable watch...but not while you're eating.",Slither
193,nycrules,Absolutely Horrendous,1,1 April 2006,"A second grader could come up with a better movie than this! This movie is so ridiculously bad it's actually insulting. If this was meant to be a spoof, it wasn't funny at all. It definitely wasn't scary at all. I couldn't believe how any major studio could actually green light a film this atrocious and throw money away on it. Hope the actors in it keep their day jobs. Everything about it was stupid beyond explanation and the only horror was spending money to sit through this total sh*t! It is one cliché after another with cheap rip-offs of other far superior superior horror films and fails miserably with attempts at gore and is just such complete nonsense that makes little plausible sense from beginning to end.

194,JoeJames76,This is what B movies are all about!,8,24 January 2007,"Nothing is more fun than settling down with a couple of friends to watch a B horror flick, filled with enough laughs, both intentional and unintentional, along with just enough plot and scariness that you remain involved. Slither does this to perfection, resurrecting a lost art that was beginning to die in a sea of horror films that take themselves too seriously, while seriously sucking up the screen.Slither announces its awfulness right off the bat, when Rooker starts running around looking like a grotesque elephant man mixed with The Fly; yet when confronted about his appearance he casually says, ""It's just a bee sting."" Instant credibility and appreciation from this reviewer! The preposterous plot is played with full on dedication and seriousness by the leads, which adds to the pleasure of watching this one. There's no attempt to cleverly wink at the audience; just a knowledge that if they are watching this, they know just as well as the filmmakers that it is everything it is supposed to be.The pleasant surprise of Slither wasn't the silly plot about an alien possessing a man so that he could procreate. Instead, it was a pleasant surprise that the action and suspense were good enough to warrant genuine fear and fright amongst the laughs. There is a bathtub scene, wisely used for the film's poster, that makes taking a bath akin to Psycho's effect on taking a shower. Even though it seems out of place in the film, it works along with the rest of it, and gives the viewer more than they expect from such a low budget film.Slither is a definite renter and has me anxiously awaiting a sequel. This is to slug films what Chuckie is to possessed doll movies. A total guilty pleasure and sure to please B movie lovers.Grade: B-",Slither
195,Sam_Youno,"""Meat!""",9,28 May 2014,"Aw, c'mon now, how can anyone NOT like this movie?My high rating assumes that anyone starting in on ""Slither"" has at least a suspicion - - the title alone is the biggest clue, and the theatrical trailer flat-out tells you what to expect - - that this is an over-the-top, affectionate, tongue-in-cheek paean to B-grade horror movies past. (""Tongue-in-cheek"" may in fact be a bit too revolting a description.) At the very least, a first-time viewer will be expecting a standard gross-out sci-fi movie.""Slither"" works either way.If you go in wanting nothing more than an hour and a half of **CGI Slugs Terrorize Small Town!**, you'll get everything you wanted. (More, in fact, because the production quality is far, far above the norm for that type of film.) But if you know, or suspect, that ""Slither"" is really a takeoff on, and a tribute to, every horror, suspense and sci-fi film ever made, then you'll be able to appreciate its real joys. You've got your slimy aliens, brought to Earth aboard a meteor (always the transport of choice for slimy aliens); you've got your small, isolated town, presumably in the southern U.S., being overrun by (in this case) giant sluglike things, controlled by a single central intelligence; you've got your curvaceous alien-fodder local girls, ready to remove their shirts at the first sign of danger; you've got your square-jawed Chief of Police, doing his duty in the face of something that was definitely not covered in his training. . . .And you've also got an astonishing number of truly hilarious moments:* The first-infected human (Grant Grant, played by Michael Rooker), early in his transformation, preparing a cozy nest for himself in the dirt and debris of his basement;* The same poor guy (his increasingly disgusting makeup is in itself a loving parody of B-grade SF films), indulging his rapidly escalating hunger for flesh---from the contents of his fridge, to the entire stock of the butcher's rib-eyes, to his neighbours' livestock;* The deadpan performance of Nathan Fillion as Police Chief Bill Pardy, who seems to be thinking, at each new repulsive incident, ""You've gotta be kiddin' me"";* The foulest-mouthed Mayor in cinematic history;* The ever-popular ""short scene after the credits,"" which is definitely worth waiting for.* Among the Extra Features (most of which are unimportant, unused scenes), one wonderful scene titled ""Filing Meat."" I can't understand why this scene didn't make the film. You should by all means check it out!The effects are not overly ambitious, but top-level for quality. And there's one brief, remarkable scene in which we get a glimpse of the world from which these creatures have come. For about five seconds the level of the CGI, both in content and detail, jumps to an entirely new plane--an immensely effective and jarring device.Do yourself a favour and check out ""Slither,"" if only for Michael Rooker's makeup.

I don't really know what to say about this one that isn't going to make you think I'm lying to you But, this was one of the best horror/comedy films I've ever seen. It was hilarious and very disturbing all at the same time! Was met to be a comedy-type product, but the gore was done so well that it was really really creepy! It's a pretty simple, yet innovative story about a tiny little meteor hitting a small town, and nobody even knowing about it until what's traveling inside infects (for lack of a better word) a man while he's out getting a drink.Like I said before, this film was pretty funny, but I think the disturbing takes precedence in my humble opinion I've seen lots and lots of horror films, and this one was pretty hardcore",Slither

198,knightc6,Not bad,7,15 November 2006,"It is what it is, and it accomplishes what it sets out to, something you can't say about many movies coming out lately.The film is a mix between horror and comedy, it isn't one complete form or the other, but it does manage to blend well enough to keep you in suspense and then laughing at the absurdity of some of the events later on.If you ever saw Night of the Creeps, you can clearly witness the large influence it had here, and it also was a horror/comedy so it's not surprising. You laugh at the funny parts, then hold your breath and get a little fearful at the scary parts, there is no conflict of direction in the film.The biggest gripe seems to be the sexual references and implications (slugs that resemble penises going in mouths, tentacles penetrating women and impregnating them, etc) but while Im not going to suggest that this wasn't in the back of the directors mind, it in no way is the focus of the film or even over the top implied.Horror fans from the 80's are probably the most likely to enjoy Slither, but others who enjoy well done FX and makeup, a good jump followed by a good laugh and an inability to ""guess"" who will die next- will find plenty to like about this film also.",Slither
199,Kazetnik,Neither horrifying nor comic,3,28 October 2006,"I was really disappointed by this. As someone who thoroughly enjoys gallows humour horror as well as baaaad B movie horror, I expected this to be thoroughly entertaining. But it wasn't.It had its moments of fun (few, including the eclectic inhabitants of the town) but it just couldn't resolve itself into either a comedy horror or a horror with a comedy twist. The stupid people weren't stupid enough to be a source of humour. The brave people weren't interesting or convincing enough to ally with. And it was both inconsistent and illogical in its 'horror' (an unforgivable crime in my view), since the effects of the creature on people kept multiplying in order to generate some new 'disgusting' (not) trick. The backstory of the creature was introduced in an interesting way, but otherwise this movie seems to try and tick all the boxes of Romero & The Thing & Killer Klowns etc etc without doing anything well enough to be enjoyable.It is also a curiously heartless film, for all its use of a romantic springboard for much of the action. Give me either a genuine B movie where the laughs are unintentional or a real horror with twisted humour, but not this, which adds nothing and seems designed merely to cash in on the genuine creativity of others.",Slither

Exploding heads, ""invasive"" tentacles, mutations, burrowing worms, and lets not forget the bloated tick woman.I really don't understand people who hate this movie because it cheezy.

201,north-julie,gory and hilarious in equal measure- a cult classic,9,10 May 2006,"When a slimy alien substance arrives-on Earth inside a medium sized asteroid, a small town in America is instantly overrun by mutant alien worms that jump into their victims mouths and turn them into mindless zombies. A local police chief and the female teacher he secretly loves fight back. They plan to take down the leader of the aliens, the husband of the teacher. He has switched from a normal middle aged man into some kind of giant squid.....If this isn't a classic example of a B-Movie plot then i don't know what is? Slither is a homage to those crappy and cheap seventies movies where giant over-sized bugs invade small towns. It has decent effects for such a small movie, and a hilarious script that provides its characters with some spectacularly fun one liners (""thats some f****d up sh*t"") Director James Gunn has not even attempted to make a serious movie here, instead filling the screen with winks at the audience (one of the shops in the town is called R J Macready after Kurt Russels character in The Thing) and gory over the top effects. Slither is a rip off of such low grade classics as Invasion of the Bodysnatchers and The Puppet Masters but it has a sense of delightful playfullness that sets it apart. It also has a lot of gore. A LOT.Nathan Fillion (Malcom Reynolds in Serenity)is Bill Pardy, the police chief dealing with the crisis affecting his hometown. He secretly has a crush on schoolteacher Starla, but she is married to Grant Grant (thats not a typo, he really does have the same first and second names) although she has feelings for him that extend beyond friendship. It just so happens that it is Grant who is the first to be affected by the bugs, and after eating most of the neighbourhoods dogs and cats he then proceeds to turn into a giant squid. Yes thats right- a giant squid.And so begins a battle between Fillion and Starla against the marauding zombies, which leads me to a clear definition of Slither- its the American version of our Shaun of the Dead. It is blessed with better effects albeit but its basically the same film.Nathan Fillion is a comedy god and he delivers his lines so well that the audience cheered whenever he was on screen. He is blessed with a great dose of comic timing, and is brilliant in a heroic role like this. Michael Rooker as the leader of the aliens is suitably menacing and his wife (Elizabeth Banks) is beautiful and vulnerable (although when she stabs one of the zombies in the neck with a giant pole she is anything but vulnerable).Slither is a brilliant B-Movie style film that contains brilliant comedy and great effects. James Gunn has produced a superb movie that really should have been a great hit at the cinema.Nathan Fillion deserves to have a hit movie!!!!",Slither

206,jimhills,Just Terrible,1,7 June 2006,"www.kajatm.com Horrible, terrible, garbage, crappy, boring, stupid, pointless, bad acting, bad movie, and shitty are all words that I would use to describe Slither. Slither, staring NO ONE, is the latest Scifi/Horror movie that is based on a meteor coming from space that contains an alien that is going to take over the world. The alien is discovered in the woods and eventually takes over the body of the father from Mall Rats. This leads to the Mall Rats father acting weird, impregnating the white trash of the town with alien worm babies and then those worm babies reeking havoc on the poor citizens of some town that doesn't exists. Of course we have the standard thriller moments and one very good gross out scene where a guy gets cut in half but outside of that this movie really sucks.So to help out in the future here are some points for you so you can identify if you are going to be in for a bad horror movie: First: You know you are going to be in for a bad movie when within the first 5 minutes they show a CGI scene where the alien enters the hopeless locals brain and the entire budget of the movie is blown in that one scene. A perfect example of this is when the main character (and I would put his name up here but what is the point? You don't know who he is, you've never seen him in any other movies and I am pretty sure no one cares who he is) is attacked by a deer that has been taken over by the alien and said deer looks like something that you just won at a carnival. I am pretty sure I could have made a more realistic scene with a digital camera and a Winnie the Poo doll. Second: You know you are going to be in for a bad horror movie when within the first 5 minutes of the movie some random hot chick doesn't take off her top. Third: You know you are going to be in for a bad horror movie when the father from Mall Rats is one of the main characters.This movie is just disappointing all around. James Gunn, who was the screen writer for Dawn of the Dead 2004, directed this abomination and I have a sinking feeling that this maybe where his directing career ends. But on a positive note not many people have the opportunity to know exactly when there life went terribly wrong, so Mr. Gunn you have that going for you which is nice. I have a suggestion for Mr. James Gunn, maybe after reading the script for the movie you should have used a Gunn and shot the person that presented the script to you and then filmed the whole thing because I am pretty sure it would have been a lot better than Slither.The movie wasn't all bad, we did have at least one good gross out scene and there were several good one liners in the movie but outside of that it sucked. But never fear Hollywood, you keep producing this stuff and I will keep paying for it cause I am a sucker for horror films. Don't see this movie and if you have already seen it don't tell people that you did. This movie is very much like a one night stand, yes you had sex but you don't want anyone to find out about it so it is best just not to mention it. But then again, what do I know?",Slither

Rather, the comedy is in the reactions of people to the situation and to each other. The lead actor, played by Nathan Fillion is appropriately darling, manly and actually has one or two of the best lines, but it's the expressions on his face that got us going a couple of times. Last seen playing the hard-edged but valiant captain of the Firefly, he is still the leader, quick to take charge but is a kinder, gentler guy. The mayor, played by Greg Henry (who had a guest role on Firefly) was terrifically fun to watch as well. Special effects were alternately pretty good and slightly cheesy, but on the whole not so bad.

208,atomicpunk40,Invasion of the Body Snachers meets Dawn of the Dead,7,1 November 2006,"I watched Slither as my Halloween movie for 2006 and - WOW - it's a great choice for anybody who loves alien invasion movies and gory zombie flicks. The movie starts out with the husband (Michael Rooker) of a popular schoolteacher (Elizabeth Banks) getting ""invaded"" (read here - his body is taken over) by the alien which starts out looking like a crawling brain. He soon acts weird (of course... he's been taken over!) by eating raw meat and killing neighborhood dogs and cats for more, shall we say, nourishment. He then impregnates a woman (alien style that is, NOT human)then tries to mutailate his wife. When the town sheriff (Nathan Fillion)a man who's always had feelings for her comes to the rescue the real trouble explodes... literally as our victim carrying the alien spawn burst forth letting them loose (they look like slugs). When they enter a person - abracadabra! instant transformation into flesh eating zombie/alien invader - and now it's up to the sheriff, the wife, and a teenage girl (Tania Saulnier) who almost gets taken over (she manages to escape) to save the day and stop the invading flesh eaters. The effects here are great. Those slug things will gross you out and the ""birth"" scene with the woman (Brenda James) as big as a house (really) with blood pouring out of her mouth crying out ""The pain, the pain! before exploding will turn your stomach. Not for the squeamish I'll say that! James Gunn (who wrote Scooby Doo, wrote and produced Scooby Doo 2 - Monsters Unleashed, and wrote the Dawn of the Dead remake)shows that he truly enjoys telling a good horror yarn, along with a good dollop of comedy thrown in. He wrote and directed Slither and this man shows impressive talent. The acting is all good here, especially Gregg Henry as the obnoxious, foulmouthed mayor of the small town with a cowardly streak. Gunn has a bit part at the beginning as a nerdy looking co-worker of Banks who tries to hit-up on her, Gunn's wife Jessica Fischer plays the police dispatcher, and look out to see Gunn's old boss, Troma Pictures legend Lloyd Kaufman (from Gunn's days working for Troma Pictures) as an arrested drunk sitting in the police station. (Gunn appeared in Kaufman's entertaining DVD intitled Make Your Own Damn Movie... you need to check this one out) In all zombie fans will be tickeled pink (or blood red) with this one while fans of evil alien invasion flicks will be in hog heaven. My rating (from excellent to poor) is a GOOD. Way to go James Gunn!",Slither
209,gregory-anderson-2,Strangely Squeamish? Aptly amusing.,6,1 May 2006,"Repulsively good fun, Slither is a b-movie remake that is strangely superior to the original. Taking the premise of an alien invasion in a town in deep-south America, the film is a well-paced shot of the infection genre.Many throwaway lines are aptly amusing. The characters resemble their stereotypes with humour and vivacity. CGI is smooth and believable. Of course, the most disturbing effect of all these together is how Michael Rooker has such a young and attractive wife.Still, you can gauge the seriousness of this relationship, the character, and of the film in general by his name  Grant Grant.Granted, horror comedy usually involves screaming teenagers  Slither manages to grow up the genre and add its mark; a diatribe of absurd human relations. You should ask yourself, will Grant Grant's tears crack you up? Not in the way you think.",Slither

Campy, self-aware and surprisingly well-executed, ""Slither"" borrows from horror movie history with savvy and intelligence whilst remaining tight and refreshingly entertaining.Ranging from whimsical to downright disgusting, this film takes us on a glorious tribute to b-horror and gives us only the creme (or slime) of the crop and should not be missed! Highly recommended.",Slither
211,mabuse786,Got the controversy,6,7 September 2006,"First of all, this movie is like SOAP. I mean it seems to be a fashion to do somehow so called horror movies today, with a twist. The twist is, you put in all the classics from 50ies, 60ies, 70ise, 80ies and 90ies, mix it up and make a movie our of it. OK, I admit, this is some kind of brain-work you have to do. I understand, that people were not laughing about this movie, because they don't know the 'chain'. Giant Tarantula, The day the earth stood still, Attack from outer space, the blob, X-Files and much more. If you haven't seen this, you won't understand the movie and there may be nothing for you to 'laugh' because it is just another 'scary movie'. However, this movies is full of citations of other movies. Now comes the good part, IMO the writers and directors did an excellent job in combining all these citing and made a modern and new mixture out of it. Also, the acting should not go unmentioned, there are really good actors in this movie, believable and very much OK for me. Please watch the movies I mentioned plus some more in this direction before your watch this movie and I believe, you will understand and laugh like me. However, this is a very interesting direction of US cinema. I would strongly recommend you as I wrote and then you can really enjoy this movie. RFM or what? :-)",Slither
212,mrmac-1,Much better than the rest of the genre,8,1 April 2010,"I've seen this film several times, and I am not a die-hard horror/gore film fan. While the story is simple, it's a kind of innocence in the characters that makes this film quite interesting and fun. It's gory, funny, and even heartfelt at times. Because it's character driven, the actors are quite important, and they each do a fine job. The special effects are well-done and used wisely. And it is, in the end, a morality tale, which adds a bit of substance. This, combined with story and acting, elevates it to a grade above the average B movie. Every once in a while, someone creates a gem among the baubles, and this film is one of those. It reminds me of another quite quirky story, Eating Raoul. If you appreciate Slither, watch the story just mentioned. You will most probably appreciate that one as well.",Slither
213,dinaia,Good horror fun,8,18 August 2014,"There are so many good things about this movie I don't know where to begin. Story, acting, dialog, human interaction, humor and a writer/director with a flair for colorful characters.I think I saw this movie for the first time as a recommendation for similar movies to Tremors. I was looking for a fun comedy horror and I thought I'd check this out. I did not imagine I'd enjoy it as much as i did especially since it's soooo gross. The alien species in this movie is especially disgusting, and I am talking here about alien Grant and the slimy slugs and why not Brenda the womb. But the reaction of the humans to all these forms of grossness is just priceless. The mayor (the excellent Gregg Henry), the chief Nathan Fillion (the personified everyday man in an exceptional situation doing his best) and Elizabeth Banks all create endearing characters and have believable, and yet very funny reactions. Gregg Henry and Michael Rooker's characters are memorable with their idiosyncrasies. The mayor explaining how you get Lyme disease, or the look on his face when he sees alien Grant for the first time or when he says that he watches animal planet all the f-ing time..it cracked me up. Or Grant's defining phrases: sugarplum, hey killer, his whole demeanor in the first phases of the change really create the character.Strange as it may sound, this movie opened other cinematic paths for me. I wanted to see more of Nathan Fillion and so I saw the excellent Firefly. I also saw the hilarious PG Porn by the same director and it's very exciting that Guardians of the Galaxy movies are also in James Gunn's hands. I like the way he brings the characters to life, they have quirkiness but also warmth and kindness about them, even when they don't do or say the nicest things.",Slither

Characters voiced what I was thinking during the gross scenes, and the black humor seemed so right in the situations it was used in. Great for Nathan Fillion fans although, I wish he had a bigger part.Gunn said he used many other movie ideas to help with this one. I recognized: Resident Evil, Tremors, Night of the Living Dead, possible X Files and Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Of course, everyone pulls from their own repertoire of movies to choose from.Awesome movie, and unless I am just a really sick person, I didn't find it that gory.",Slither

216,muvcritic,Slither Parodies Classic Monster Movies,7,24 October 2010,"""If I weren't about to s*** in my pants right now, I'd be f****** fascinated."" -- Jack MacReady (Gregg Henry)The classic monster movies of the '50s were spawned from national paranoia, but the blobs, giant insects and other BEMs (Bug-Eyed Monsters) are, these days, the object of satire in movies like Tremors, Lake Placid, Eight-Legged Freaks, and now writer-director James Gunn's Slither.Like most of its forbears, Slither deals with a rural community beset by some slimy horror which no one will believe in until at least the third reel, the exception here being the hapless Grant Grant (Michael Rooker). Poking too close to a recently fallen meteorite, Grant is possessed by a primordial intelligence determined to make Earth its next colony.I realized that Slither was, regardless of its exaggerated, cartoonish violence, designed to be a comedy due to the very implausibility of that premise. No, not the primordial alien intelligence part, but the proposition that anyone's parents would give him the same first and last name. On the other hand, I once knew a man named Robert R. Roberts, and I couldn't bring myself to ask what his middle initial stood for.Nathan Fillion (Serenity) has little to work with, but does okay as the sheriff and least moronic of a town full of morons, and Elizabeth Banks (The 40 Year-Old Virgin) does what she can as Grant's spouse, doggedly determined to be a good wife even if her husband has mutated into a giant space slug, but Gregg Henry (primarily a TV actor guesting in series like The Gilmore Girls and Boston Public) steals the show as the profane and idiotic town mayor. The funniest thing about the movie is that it tacitly insinuates that this virtually brain-dead community, populated by goofy-looking rednecks, probably deserves its fate. In fact, they may be better off; possession by a mysterious cosmic intelligence may be preferable to no intelligence at all.Then I noticed the sign in the background: ""Welcome to Wheelsey, South Carolina.""My son turned and asked, ""Dad, is that really what Hollywood thinks South Carolina is like?"" Remembering how many productions South Carolina has lost to neighboring states simply because actors and crew from L.A., New York and London couldn't envision being trapped for four months in what they perceive as a rustic hell, I confessed to him that, sadly, it is. And to add insult to injury, the producers of Slither didn't even have the decency to make their movie here, but instead shot in Canada, never mind that movies including The Big Chill, Doc Hollywood, The Notebook and Radio have portrayed South Carolina as being inhabited by other than illiterate dopes.I guess it's disingenuous of me to have laughed when I thought the movie took place in Georgia or Alabama, but to bridle upon realizing it's supposed to be South Carolina. If you live in SC and can get over your own righteous indignation, and if outrageous gore doesn't bother you, Slither is an amusing parody of the classic monster movie.",Slither

Overall it's bubblegum, you enjoy it for a little while then forget about it, but such is the nature of the Gore genre, so the mission is accomplished. Slither is better than most gore films I have seen, and for fans of the genre Slither is a must see.

219,djvale,"A damn good splat fest! ""The Thing meets Dawn of the Dead""!",7,7 January 2008,"I'm not really one for horror movies, in fact, it takes a really good horror movie for me to actually give it the thumbs up. And for a horror film to keep me laughing, chuckling, giggling and squirming all at once, is a pretty damn good effort to me! Its like horror fans have made this film for horror fans, and they have certainly delivered the goods here.This isn't your normal teen slasher, psycho axe wielding horror flick, its about your average Texas town, with small cops, friendly neighbours and a collective community spirit. This is where the film unclothes its big bad secret weapon. It goes completely over the top on the body count, cringe worthy scenes, black humour and vileness which is what I love! Its so unpredicatble and insane that it actually works.Here we have a story of one man, who people are quite jealous of. Old Grant (Michael Rooker). He is married to a beautiful young lady called Starla (played by Elizabeth Banks) who works in the local school, a popular girl who everybody loves. Grant however, after one night of missed out passion with Starla, turns his back on her and heads out to the local. After a few beers, he meets a girl who had a high school crush on him for years. With this in mind, and just before an unlawful move on his part, he decides its best not to have a one night fling with this woman. On his curiosity, Grant stumbles upon what looks like an alien slug, that bizarrely injects a spine into his chest. With all of this happening within the first 10 minutes of the film, you can bet your bottom dollar what the ending is going to be like! From here on, we get some of the most under-rated scenes of vileness in cinema history as we see Grant turn from the humble man he is, into one of the ugliest and most powerful beast I've seen in years. Its not only the transformation that is frightening, its the plight of mind power that Grant uses on his victims with the use of large red slugs that turn its prey into flesh eating zombie like creatures. Its through these zombies, that Grant puts a piece of his once old self, into. Its quite interesting to see the transformation, but yet, still frightening that Grant still has a small piece of his heart left. And that heart is reserved for Starla.With a storyline like this, it has to be over the top. Which is why it works so well. The unique twist of gore, comedy, gore, comedy - works so well. Obviously the film is flawed with its acting in parts, which is why my rating drags it down a bit from being an A-Class horror to a B-Class horror. The supporting cast do well, but slowly deteriate as the film reaches its finale. Which is a shame, as it does end slightly clichéd - but I still had a smile on my face! Its still definitely worth the viewing. If you like your horrors over the top, then prepare to be taken away into a skin crawling horror flick, full of laughs, one liners, gags, blood, guts and lots of slugs. If your more into the serious type of horror, then you will not like this film.",Slither

I am. And I can not help myself thinking about those 80's cheesy horror that I such kicked out of watching at theater Saturday after noon when I was kid. Slither is the horror movie that carries such a traits. Movie takes a place in small country town, and aliens/slugs became devastating threats to local people. Only help they can get is local sheriff played by Nathan Fillon. This movie contains very strong graphic violent as bad as today's standard horror, but goofy humor toned down the edge of reality and intensity to make this film as great 80's style fun splter movie. Nathan Fillon effectively use his goofy side. Old school Micheal Rooker was great for mayor of the town.

222,yoshi_indo,A good creature feature with decent black comedy,7,18 April 2011,"Slither is fun movie, it does not brake any barriers but what it offers is refined to an enjoyable standard.The Cinematography in this movie was very good, all the shots are used to clearly highlight the gore and the director clearly has no qualms with visceral imagery. The lighting is good, and one scene juxtaposing violence with jubilation was done really well.The writing is above average. The characters are great and only one, one note character was found in this movie. The story itself was formulaic reminiscent of ""Planet Terror"" meets ""Alien"",but is executed quite well without any idiotic horror clichés (e.g. a character asks his zombie friend if he is alright and proceeded to get infected accordingly).The jokes are quite subtle and mostly visual, with a few one liners that worked well with the scenes. In the end Slither is a good late night horror movie worth a rental. If you enjoy gratuitous violence with light hearted a tone, you will thoroughly enjoy this movie!7/10",Slither
223,jpmota,Off to a slow start...,5,16 September 2006,"Since the July opening has been delayed to September (or maybe later) I had to see this movie through some alternative ways. I was expecting something funny and was presented with a very dull, slow movie, full of stereotypes.But then it started to warm up and, though the script is somewhat lame, it grabs your attention more than once. In the end, I was glued to the screen to watch how it would end.The actors save most of the movie, since the script is the usual zombie-from-outer-space-blob-thing we've seen in dozens of previous movies. The characters are your usual American little town people, which make Nathan Fillion's character stand out as someone that doesn't fit: a cute smart-mouth policeman in such a dull town? Didn't convince me.The Mayor, and Grant Grant are very well played. The foul mouthed Mayor was hilarious, and Grant Grant keeps it's stiffness and pride although he's becoming a slug himself.The scene where the entire zombified family is trying to convince the girl that escaped, to come out of the car, was terrific. (Although a stereotype from zombie movies as well.) But I am a sucker for this kind of movies, and loved it to the end.As we say here: to be taken with a grain of salt (which means: not to be taken to seriously), since it can be a very funny movie.",Slither

Hilarious dialogue executed perfectly, monsters not purely cgi but used tastefully to enhance reality not replace it, and Elizabeth Banks. Although this film completely bombed in the theaters only grossing I think 15 million and costing around 30 million to make I regret not seeing it on the big screen every time I watch it at home which is about once a month. This movie has a lot of comedic value but is essentially a horror film. I feel because it was portrayed as a comedy in the trailers this in turn resulted in the lack of ticket sales since horror films as a whole are on the up slope. It has been recognized by the horror critics with much praise and the DVD is packed with a ton of special features. We haven't seen the last of James Gunn and hopefully not Slither that's for sure.",Slither
225,shanerittersbach,"""If This Turns Out to Be a Mountain Lion were Gonna Look Like a Bunch of Damn Idiots!""",10,18 May 2017,"Slither, James Gunn's Masterpiece of splatter, slime, and slugs!WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD!!!SLITHER came out all the way back in 2006, a year filled to the brim with horror films. With films such as Snakes on a Plane, Black X-mas (remake), and the cult favorite Behind the Mask: The Rise of Leslie Vernon, it was nice to see a major studio, such as universal release what is the equivalent of a TROMA film with a great budget. James Gunn, who now recently is known for directing Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy volumes 1 and 2, was a young struggling screenwriter in the early 2000's. He was hungry for a film to direct. Two years before he would eventually direct slither he wrote the screenplay/script for Zack Snyder's Dawn of the Dead remake. After Dawn had destroyed the box office gunn wanted to direct. Soon Gunn would wright the script for slither and that's where my review begins. To start off, slither has one of the best ensemble casts i have ever seen in a horror film, or a film in general. The cast includes Castle's Nathan Fillion who plays the films titular sheriff Bill Pardy. Elizabeth Banks (40-Year old Virgin) joins the cast as well, playing Starla Grant, the lovely and ballsy high school teacher. Now the films titular villain is played by the very versatile Michael Rooker (Henry ; Portrait of a Serial Killer) who plays Grant Grant (No, seriously, that's His last name) starla's husband and soon to be alien life form. The rest of the cast of Slither includes the comedic Gregg Henry (Raising Cane), a cameo by Lloyd Kaufman (Toxic Avenger), and Rob Zombie (The Devil's Rejects). The acting in the film is very well acted. The dialogue is classic in hilarity and zaniness. The film has an abundant of inside jokes and innuendos. The writing is also very well done, the story is fleshed out. The characters are all enjoyable and realistic.The effects in the film are extraordinary and quite possibly some of the best practical effects i have ever seen, Really. The effects were accomplished by makeup and creature genius Todd Masters (Demon Knight, Tales from the Crypt, Monster Man). The main creature within the film, the Grant monster, is an amazing creation. He is slimy, icky, and wonderfully acted by Michael Rooker. The slug effects within the film are also great. The effects of the gore and carnage are also very well done and bloody that is. Within the film there is a fair use of CGI. Thank goodness, the CGI is very well done. Very good use of the CGI around the slugs and extra gore. The effects also fit perfect within the scenes they are featured. That is something that cant be quite said in modern films, i'm not going to name any ... The Thing (2011). The film is well directed and well acted, altogether it is a modern 80's classic. Slither is most definitely James Gunn's lover letter to the horror films of the 1980's. Their inspiration is clear and present in slither, though unlike most nostalgic films of today the odes and Easter eggs don't stick out like a soar thumb. Slither is a personal favorite of mine and one i will always enjoy, plus i cant wait till July 25th, when Scream Factory releases their Blu- ray collector's edition this year. CANT WAIT!!!anyways, Great Film ... Two-Tentacles Way the Heck Up!!!!",Slither
226,Scudpipes,Neither flesh nor foul,1,29 October 2006,"Movie is an insult to the Jimmy Caan 70s flick of the same name; and to the audience. Gunn makes great play of it being a homage to just about EVERY horror movie (read 'rip-off'), even down to referencing characters and directors - big deal - Brundle's Meat - so what? And thinks he is making something neat and smart and knowing - but the flick just deteriorates into a dull ZOMBIE movie. Like we need another one of those. He wastes Rooker's superlative talents by turning him into a motionless blob; and offs the sorely underused Greg Henry. Leaving us with what? Nathan Fillion and staggering zombies. If Gunn could have spent some time being less pleased with himself, maybe he could have ironed out the glaring plot holes - for example, why do one horde of zombies become 'Grant' - talk like him, think like him; but the gal's entire family DON'T. Stupid. Also, check this - less is more. I found ONE slug in my kitchen the other day. It freaked me out. Gunn's gazillions of the critters didn't one iota. Lame. Limp. Not funny. Not scary. He's put the good cause of horror back twenty years. Oh, and Gunn 'F**k you fat-ass' is not good dialogue, neither is 'this is some f**ked up sh*t'.

227,finraziel,First movie ever I've walked out of...,1,30 April 2006,"Okay, first off, I usually skip the reviews that rate a movie a 1, but I vote a 1 for this anyway because it really is awful, and I feel like I have to compensate for the masses of high votes this movie is getting for some reason. Really, me and my friends were baffled both by how bad this movie was, and how it was the first time that IMDb had rated a bad movie so high. The only thing I can think of is that every single person that had anything to do with this movie asked their entire family to go write reviews or something. This movie was also the first one ever for me to not view until the end in cinema (and I've seen a LOT of movies in cinema), but we went to ask the cinema owner if the second part got any better and he actually admitted that it only got worse and he had gotten tons of complaints about this movie. He told us he had no choice but to show it because of a contract or something...Anyway, as for the movie, now I may have only seen the first part, but it was soooo boring, nothing happened. Seriously, if you've seen the trailer, you've seen the movie. Nothing else happens. The acting is very unconvincing as well, and the special effects are laughable. Now this in itself is not always that bad, and me and my friends actually started this movie with comments like ""this movie is proud to be B"" expecting to laugh our ass off, just like with movies like shawn of the dead and army of darkness as other people have compared this too... But, there was nothing. Seriously, I LOVED those other movies, but this, I didn't even get one chuckle out of the part I've seen, and the only startle I had was because after half an hour of nothing at all happening we were nearly falling asleep, there was one cheap thing-jumping-out-in-front-of-the-camera type scene. Yeah, that's really worth my money there. (I don't want to mark this review as spoiler, hence the vague description.)Seriously, I know bad reviews in a sea of good reviews usually get ignored (I usually ignore them myself), but please just don't go watch this movie unless you enjoy wasting your time and money. We had more fun sitting in the lobby upstairs waiting for the next movie, rolling a ball one of us had around, than sitting through that piece of crap. I'm quite a shy person, but I actually turned towards the line of waiting people and raised my voice to warn them to please not go to slither while getting tickets for the next show (other movie! heh ;)), that's how much I want to warn people against seeing this...",Slither
228,Ultra-violence,same story told differently...,7,6 April 2006,"There is no way that any film can be taken seriously when the a small South Carolina town is being attacked by thousand upon thousand of orally fixated cooked beets, who soon will turn into what resembles a drugged up version of Jabba the Hut. Luckily for writer and director James Gunn's (Dawn of the Dead remake) film Slither, he doesn't take it too seriously either. But with a little dash of gore, a pinch of tongue and cheek humor and a look at the evolutionary process that we all know and love, Slither becomes something more than just your average horror film. With a basketball size meteorite breaking through the earth's atmosphere, a new species begins looking for a new place that they can call home and what better place to start than in a small Arkansas town that is gearing up for deer hunting season. As the rude sleazy Mayor (Gregg Henry, 24) addresses the city and announces ""Let the hunt begin!"" which hunt is he referring too? Deers or humans? But the species can't begin its reproduction with out the help of a human mind that they can bury their reign wart into, creating a meat craze zombie like trance out of human begins, eventually turning into dangerous mutated squids. Luckily, after being received the ""I'm not in the mood,"" line from his wife Starla Grant (Elizabeth Grant The 40 Year Old Virgin), sexually frustrated Grant Grant (Michael Rooker Mallrats) stumbles drunk into the woods discovers a plasmatic trail leading to an over-sized maggot that plants a ring worm into his brain. Grant then begins to battle mentally with the worm as the alien begins to control his thoughts and desires. It isn't just slugs that Gunn emphasizes in the film but shows the growing rate of a tick when Bill Pardy (Nathan Dillon, Serenity), the small town sheriff and his trigger happy police squad discover the two meter long tick of a woman as she's begins to hatch. There's something to say that James Gunn is paying tribute to all the physical pain that women endure during childbirth because the way that she gives birth seems utterly painful and ""tears"" me apart. If it wasn't for the police squad and the town's mayor's off the wall dialogue, the film would never have gotten over the hump in the first act of the film that slowly and effortlessly developed the plot line. Everything said or done in the film from then on is a hilarious tongue and cheek formula that resembles a lot like the new audience pleaser film 'Shaun of the Dead' that throws in intense scenes like being attacked by a 8 inch slug in the privacy of your own bathtub, whose only goal is to crawl down your throat. I do enjoy the fact that Starla's drive was to cure her sick mutated squid of a husband and ultimately uses the drive against him in the end. Although I do feel sympathy for Grant when he's the monster because he is given the ultimate tease that any male attitude can live without.Slither became a great film that gruesomely tells the same story that everyone has seen or heard, but gives it a little bit more animation and a pleasurable time. I would rather see this type of overgrown slugs trying to take over the universe than to sit down for an hour watching the Fox news channel.",Slither

The script was predictable (a fact that the soundtrack indicated was intentional via its pomposity), and every character was little more than a stereotype (hence no real heart to the movie), but Gunn was at least clever enough to play to the actors' strengths. Larfs and chills were about evenly balanced. There was something oddly sweet about the movie in a '50s-drive-in sorta way. ""Slither"" is a solid early-summer flick: forgettable but fun.",Slither
231,MakoSucks,Night of the Creeps - anything that made it good + cg= Slither,1,11 April 2006,"So from the people that brought us the Dawn of the Dead remake, and the scooby doo movies, comes Slither! A gory, sick, and funny romp of fun and extreme scaryness! What a load of LIES! First of all, all the gore in this one is nothing but Computer generated nonsense. It wasn't sick, or anything, it was just...there. Everything was pretty tame, and fake. The ""funny"" bits were mainly adding curse words to the dialogue that half sounded like annoying audience heckling. Oh also everyone is a hick in this movie. The only funny parts were the shameless attempts at horror. a small shadow, the size of one of the slugs, passes by, that you could barley notice, and a jump in the music scares you. It was nothing more than a lame attempt at a Shawn of the dead type of comedy movie, with even lamer attempts of horror.The only thing close to a redeeming factor for this crapfest, was a useless, small clip of the Toxic Avenger. The part where the nerd sticks the mop in the jacuzzi. LLoyd Kaufman also made a cameo as an extra. No dialogue at all. just him as a drunk. Wasted elements.SLither was nothing more than another ""remake"" Like Dawn of the Dead 04, except it didn't keep the name of the original. Instead of wasting your time and money on this, go watch what this movie tried to rip off of, Night of the Creeps! Or a Troma movie. Thats all this movie made me feel like, was to go watch more troma movies. Those are funny, gory, extreme, and entertaining, all opposites of Slither.",Slither
232,damo1971,Slimy disgusting but fun,7,6 May 2006,"As I have been to the cinema regularly over the last year or so you get to see quite a few trailers. When I originally saw the trailer for this film I really wasn't certain whether I would like it or not. In fact it crossed my mind on many occasions to give it a miss. Being a little bit of a cinema geek now I also listen and read many reviews, a lot of which were complimentary about this film, so I thought what the hell, lets go and see it. I am glad that I did, I thought it got the balance between horror/drama and comedy was really well handled. I thought the acting was really spot on, not taking the film too seriously without turning it into a farce. There were many occasions whether I wanted to squirm or laugh. To me, I thought this film was a good honest film with no pretensions of being something that it wasn't. It is just quite a simple story of alien 'slugs' who land on earth with the intention of taking it over, and a group of people who try to stop them, real simple but highly enjoyable. Finally, I thought the Mayor was great.",Slither
233,Syndicateman,It could've been better.... WAY better,5,1 April 2006,"I read a lot of comments on this before I went to go see Slither. I walked in expecting Shaun Of The Dead but I was a lil disappointed. It was funny for about 25 minutes out of the entire movie. The rest was just random running around shooting stuff and women getting impregnated by alien tentacles(not sexually though... I know, sounds weird but it isn't sex). It took forever for the storyline to actually pick up. I really didn't care about the characters that were focused on in the begginning.The movie was a lil disturbing but it definitely isn't something your kids should see. The idea was good but I didn't want to see that much slimy blood and guts. Just didn't feel funny. The film could've been REALLY good and it is OK. But don't expect Shaun Of The Dead. It has it's moments.The gore wasn't gore but more sexual slime than anything. Nobody was raped but I felt like they didn't need to show all of the slugs infecting humans and stuff. Could've just skipped some of the slug shots. There were just a little tooooooo much. The slugs could've been funny but instead were shown a little too much(and I had recently ate Mexican food so not a good combo).You may love it... you may like it.... you may hate it but it is a movie at the end of the day. It has problems(some of which I could've fixed if they had given me 5 minutes)and I felt like for such a short movie they must have edited out a lot of the funny parts because the groseness was in every scene. That's not bad but I felt like it was going to be a parody and not an actual horror film.",Slither

It is disgusting at times, but it's also funny, creepy and much better than I had expected. The lead actors are great - Rooker and the actor from Firefly are the best - and the script is above average. Think Invasion of the Body Snatchers meets Tremors with a bit of Arachnaphobia thrown in. (While you're watching the film, you'll feel like something is crawling on you.) I was surprised at how much I enjoyed myself.

237,chongchuanmun,What could I say? The Best B-Grade Movie Ever?,5,24 August 2006,"In the spirit of cheesy B-Grade movies, this movie owns the throne. Take Body Snatcher, mix it with a zombie movie (any zombie movies), and then sprinkle a little bit of love on it (a good one, like Titanic or Gone With The Wind), and viola, you get Slither. Gory, funny, and highly entertaining when you are up at 3 in the morning having a cup of insomnia and a plate of migraine. Perfect fun for the loner couch potato who doesn't have a life.Sounds confusing? Yes. I do agree. The movie in itself is funny and entertaining, if you have time to kill and nothing else better to do. It provides you with enough gore to stop you from finishing your bag of chips. Blood, flesh, slugs everywhere. A must watch for those who like it disgusting.Story wise, it doesn't have much. It's an old and repetitive formula, but oddly original. 'A conscious disease' they call it. Something new in the movies today. The idea itself is terrifying. The execution, not so much. However, I do have to commend the director for taking the bold in actually developing the storyline (whatever storyline it has) within that short 80+ minutes. It does gives the character more depths, and much more believable. His efforts actually shows. Due to this, you won't feel cheated or insulted after watching the movie. You felt like there was actually a solid story behind it (even though this may just be an illusion).I would also like to applaud the art director for his wonderful job in the set design. The sheriff's office looks especially realistic. For a moment there, I actually wondered if they were shooting the movie in a set, or in real life buildings in a real life town. The stickers on the glass door, the mess on the officer's tables, all of them very nicely done.The only disgusting about the movie, aside from the gore, were the acting. Not one of the actors in the movie can act. Not one of them could portray the characters, or even give you an illusion that they were real. But perhaps if you look at it in another point of view: from real life, you may feel that they are good actors, because that's how real people would react to the situation. You see a head blown off and a slug coming out of it (and you're out of ammo), you turn around and run! Still the only nauseating feeling I got from the movies did not come from the gore, but from the acting. Lying there watching with wide eyes when the only grenade that could save humanity exploded in the water just cracked me up, and then I puke. In my humble opinion, if you put a slug into the every actors' brain (and the casting director's), they would actually do a much better job than this.I also strongly urge Air Supply to sue this movie. I appreciate the humor of using a sentimental song in a gory scene, but from now on, every time I hear that song, I will only remember pieces of flesh on the floor, an ugly infected man tearing the flesh out of another dead human, slugs, and a big fat hideous blob with tentacles. Thank you Mr. Composer for ruining one of my favorite love songs. Not only did he/she skipped the job of composing an eerie music for this sequence, he/she also insulted the sanctity of music. He/she crossed the line in matching music with picture. Someone should shoot him/her in the head.The director/writer did make a mistake towards the end of the movie. To cause a gas explosion, you need a spark. A gun produces sparks. Brilliant idea! Here's another: the spark is produced when the bullet is hit by the hammer and when it scratches the gun barrel. When a bullet penetrates the flesh, no sparks are produced. I suggest that in his next movie, maybe the director would like to consult with the caveman who discovered fire.Finally, why do the slugs always have to go for the mouth (when the first one didn't)? There are so many other holes in the body, and some of them are more interesting than others to be invaded! I am sure the girl in the bathtub wouldn't object (though she would scream) if the slug were only a little more intelligent. If you think I am being vulgar here, think back to Dreamcatcher, The Hills Have Eyes, and Species.All in all, that's 90 minutes of my life that I won't be getting back, but I can't really say it was a waste. And the ending song? Someone shoot me, please!",Slither
238,lordzardoz,A highly entertaining movie.,9,4 November 2006,"This is a movie that I greatly enjoyed. But like many other movies I enjoy, it is one where you will probably know if you will like it long before you see it.And now spoilers.The premise of the movie is hardly academy award material. The plot is based on an alien life form that crashes to earth in a small town. The meteor cracks open, and someone is infested, and soon you have plenty of slugs that turn people into zombies. There is also a secondary plot where the main character and his love interest, but pretty much every movie has that sort of thing.The good parts of this movie deliver though. The slugs and monsters look great. The movie also has one of the better evisceration deaths in any movie that I have ever seen. The dialog is funny. The town setting is surprisingly believable, with plenty of convincing ugly people to act as slug fodder. And by ugly people, I mean convincing ugly. Most movies will have either typical generic good looking people, or over the top grotesquelyugly. Slither has the sort of Ugly people you would run into on the street.There is not a whole lot that is purely original in this movie, and its not going to win any awards, but it is certainly a great movie to just sit down and watch and enjoy.END COMMUNICATION",Slither
239,BillMoseleyMan,Great Fun,7,23 October 2006,"Sorry to say I missed Slither earlier in theaters, but glad to say I caught it at Screamfest. The film just rocks. It is a great mixture of many things and never slows down for a minute. While easily like Night of the Creeps, Slither captures all the essence of what made that film so memorable and catapulted it to cult status. I have a feeling in time Slither will be better appreciated and soon claim its crown as a cult film. Whereas NOTC was a great 80s film, Slither is more polished and produced for a better budget, greatly adding in accomplishing thrills, chills, slick creatures, and cool camp. If you missed it, buy the DVD. While going for both the jugular and the funny bone, Slither is a film that rarely succeeds in combining the two. In fact I have not seen a film that has so successfully combined the humor with chills since the original Return of the Living Dead. Horror fans need to support more films like this so that the current resurgence in this genre stays fresh, exciting, and groundbreaking; many of the attributes that are contained within Slither.",Slither

It lacks the depth and quality the makers put into the products it is trying imitate.If watching a two hour demented puke fest of man eating worms with all the guts and gore of a fifth grader crude joke is your cup of tea then I highly recommend it.

243,thro81,"Well written, entertaining B-movie that does it's job",8,8 June 2012,"Slither is an intentional B-movie, the sooner you realize that the better. James Gunn made this as homage to the kind of horror films he likes. The special effects are bad, sometimes it is just silly and the acting is not too believable and logically it's dumb. All that makes it sound like a horrible movie, but still it works, as what it's intended to be. The first part of the movie the small town where the film takes place is introduced along with its most important people; the police chief (of course), the mayor, one couple and then just some other fill- ups. The actors have some kind of chemistry which makes the film much more than just watchable. What makes this movie work is that it is not offensively stupid; it is consistently silly throughout the runtime and hilarious at time. If you like this kind of funny, gory, zombie/alien B-movies, this film will definitely keep you entertained throughout the runtime. It is a well written and entertaining movie with good casting. This is what comedy horror movies are supposed to be like - 7/10",Slither
244,MechaWingZero,One of my all time favorites.,9,4 February 2012,"(only minor spoilers though!) I cannot believe how good this movie is. Every other ""comedy horror"" movie I've ever seen in the end is really just a twisted comedy. While that isn't necessarily bad, it's really astonishing to me that Slither can pull off being funny and truly scary in many instances.This movie doesn't drag much at all. Every scene has you curious what will happen next. It has literally all of the elements that I feel make for a great B movie - action, suspense, humor, attractive women, scares, and heart. And as a bonus, the acting is actually surprisingly competent. The main idea of the movie's plot is that a crater from outer space comes down (obvious tribute to ""The Blob"") and turns a man into a disgusting slimy alien-esque creature who procreates, resulting these disgusting slimy worms. Cool, huh? One thing about this movie that seems to never be mentioned is that it has a very southern feel to it. It takes place in the south, the characters have southern accents, a tavern is briefly shown with confederate flags flying, and as the cherry on top the antagonist's name is ""Grant Grant"" (he has the same first name as last name). I don't know why no critic ever mentions this as I feel it is a BIG part of the film, and I love it. If the makers of movie did this to give to make the film more lovable, they succeeded big time. Although filming actually took place in Canada, they sure did an outstanding job of making the set feel like the American Southeast.Now having stated my love for Slither, I will admit that it isn't for everyone. If you are more drawn to meaningful dramas, romantic comedies, or documentaries, or are just easily grossed-out, you may well not enjoy this movie at all. But if you love films about zombies, alien invasions and creatures, you'll love Slither.Lastly, if you are new to the horror genre, I recommend watching some other movies before this because part of the entertainment value in Slither is that it's a tribute. Try seeing The Blob (1958), one or two of Romero's zombie films, and maybe Invasion of the Body Snatchers (doesn't matter if it's the original or the 1978 remake) or any films similar to these first. You'll be glad you did.",Slither

The cast is absolutely wonderful, and if you have ever been to small town America, you will know what I mean. The characters are colorful and believable. Furthermore, the story is compelling and original. Even the monster is different from what you might expect. Sure the concepts are similar, but I don't understand why that would take away anything from its originality. I mean nobody ever says that a love-story is unoriginal even though there are literally tens of thousands of variations of this genre.

If you like body piercing alien tentacles, and slimy slugs crawling down your throat and controlling your brain, this movie's for you. Every scene is a homage to great cult classics and hits its target audience in the head with a 50 pound bag of fun dropped from the Empire State Building. Granted, I'm no film expert but I am an avid moviegoer and I give this one a very anti-ebert 2 thumbs up (16 tentacles and 100,000 slugs). The reason this movie isn't rated higher is simply it's not a great or a classic by any means. It is just a no-holds-barred good time, and sometimes thats the best time you can have in the confines of a movie theater with a fat red haired woman sitting next to you chomping her week-size tub of extra buttered popcorn and screaming every time she sees the firefly guy in danger. ....sigh....7/10",Slither

The thing is, it's one of those genre-bending horror-comedy flicks and I find those too contrived and cheeky to like. The only one coming to mind at all being Eli Roth's ""Cabin Fever"" -- which I'd recommend to fans of ""Slither"".""Slither"" impressed me completely. I found myself cringing at the (top-notch) effects and laughing at many of the deftly-executed jokes throughout. For me this movie succeeded in its two objectives -- grossing me out and making me chuckle. And what more could I ask for? In order to appreciate this you need to have an open mind while viewing. Don't watch set out to deliberately not laugh or else the hilarity of the movie will be in vain. Don't watch and expect nightmare-inducing images of horror because this movie is not like that -- it's a pure splatterfest. Never did I feel scared but the awesome gore and flawless creature design were admirable and nasty (aka *NOT* a CGI free-for-all a la ""The Midnight Meat Train"").Every character you encounter from the major to the minor is perfect. They're all 100% genuine and could easily exist among us. We have no He-Men or Wonder Women who can have their arm torn from its socket and four rounds embedded in their chests and still pummel the baddies.While on the topic of characters I MUST mention Gregg Henry (who played Mayor Jack MacReady). He is comedic gold and is quite possibly the most quotable dude in cinema history. His role made the movie for me (well, that may be a stretch...) and I need to commit some of his one-liners to memory to use day-to-day. In any other movie the lines would've been pure cheese and killed the feel, but the timing of the comedy is brilliant.Most horror-comedy crossovers have an atrocious story with trite ideas and try to force snickers out of you with sheer ridiculousness alone, but not ""Slither"". This had a feasible plot with clever ideas (though it may have borrowed a thing or two from creature-feature heavy-weight ""Alien"") and if it wasn't such a riot it would've made a damn fine alien invasion flick.An 80's horror throwback, a knot-inducing riot, and a splatterfest like no other, I have nothing negative to say about ""Slither"".

The movie is tons of fun, both in the dialogs and in the visuals, there are some crazy stuff in this film, but at the same time, I also found it quite thrilling and suspenseful when it wanted to, and with that, you'll really be bouncing between moments of pure laughter with genuinely chilly parts where you kind of care for the characters.

James Gunn himself said at a recent Fangoria Weekend of Horrors in Chicago that the only film that played a part in ""Slither"" was David Cronenberg's ""They Came from Within"" (AKA - ""Shivers""). There's a blatant homage to it that fans of the Cronenberg film will spot right away, and that's cool. That what James Gunn is about. You forget, this is a guy from the house that Kaufman built - Troma. Nods and inside jokes abound in ""Slither"". It's a horror movie for real horror movie fans. Slimy, not gory. Funny, not insipid. ""Slither"" is the next logical step from the guy who wrote the remake of ""Dawn of the Dead"".

Lame, unamusing monsters, few jokes, no horror (didn't really expect that though) - there's precious little to recommend this deal. I've seen worse is about all I can say, but not recently.

That someone found it in their hearts to pour money into this project is beyond me, but it gives promise for mankind as a giving and generous species.A script as poorly written as this hopefully only gets set into production once every decade, in which case we should be safe for the next fifty years or so, as this definitely makes up for a few decades to come. They even got a couple of normally above average actors to ""star"" in this flick, which to me seems like a strong sign their careers are going down in a havoc of flames.A poor script combined with acting resembling what you'd expect to find at a kindergarten play (aside from the fact that might prove to be charming) leaves only the special effects as a potential savior of this epic mess. While I must admit I have seen worse FX, you've come to expect a little more at this day and age.I hope James Gunn is a pseudonym. I would have been shameful for the rest of my years if my name was associated with this fiasco.All in all; if you enjoy watching turkeys, this might prove semi fun.

263,zomboscloset,"Zombos Closet Review: Great Monsterfest, witty dialog, fun script",9,8 May 2006,"Slither is a wonderful mix of CGI, puppetry, animation, tried-and-true special effects and horrific makeup artistry that, combined with a witty, fast-paced script and bread and butter cinematography, is a fun and terrifying romp at the same time. The story breezes along with colorful small-town characters that experience the horror of an alien slug invasion in classic 1950s/80s alien slug invasion horror movie style.What sets this horror film apart from so many of the half-baked, 'hey, let's snuff those teenagers again in all sorts of gruesome, but oddly enjoyable ways' films that have inundated the theatres lately, is its skillful approach to the classic elements that make a horror movie, well, horrific. And, of course, wisely leaving out those annoying dull-witted teenagers. For a refreshing change, we have a cast of seasoned actors chewing up the scenery just as the scenery starts chewing them up.What a concept! To actually focus on the characters and have the story unfold with them instead of at them. And it is rather refreshing to have a memorable alien MONSTER for a change, instead of the usual anti-social inbred pychotic guy prowling the outback, or torture-club circuit. A horror movie with a 'real' monster! Wow. The gradual evolution of Grant ""it's just a bee sting"" Grant to amorphous, Lovecraftianesque-tentacled slug is wonderful (in that horror movie wonderful sort of way, of course). The tongue-in-cheek dialog between the characters is filled with snappy one-liners and wry observations (see IMDb's movie quotes for some hilarious reading).From the opening scene with Nathan Fillion sitting in the police car, to the climactic battle between him and the ubiquitous alien Grant Grant, tension and mayhem builds to a fever pitch. I held my breadth toward the end: I did not want the film to be spoiled by the rote sequelization-antic type ending that spoiled The Hills Have Eyes, and so many, otherwise, good horror films. I was rewarded with no bogus, 'hey, I'm still going to get you' ending.Gore is used with wicked attention to plot placement and effect. Instead of the redder the better and splash it to the walls approach all too common these days, key scenes are made more intense by using gore to move the storyline action ahead. One particular scene of note involves an unfortunate run in with Grant ""that looks like something that fell off my dick in the war"" Grant and a claw-tipped tentacle that leaves one person beside himself--literally. The barn scene involving the birth of the slugs is also well constructed and quite digusting (but in that horror wonderful way again). This scene stands out as a well constructed balance between CGI, traditional special effects and moody lighting. I am eager to pick up the Cinefex issue on this film's effects, as they combine so many classical elements with a 2006 sensibility.And there are Zombies! Just when you think it cannot possibly get any better, meat devouring zombies with insatiable appetites start popping up, or should I say, lurching along. So much for Family Fun Day in the small town of Wheelsy. Mike Syzmanski, in his review of Slither, aptly describes Slither as a drive-in movie. If you like classic, B-Movie, 50s style horror, this movie is for you. Writer and director James Gunn, along with a very talented crew of horror-heads, has fashioned an honest to gosh monster horror film. Not a slasher, torture, snuff horror, psychotic bogeyman retread, but an honest to gosh monster horror film.There may yet be hope for the genre after all.",Slither

Just when it starts to get good out comes some unrealistic and entirely UNfunny joke. Why does everyone who gets the chance to work with this kind of material feel the need to inject it with smug humor? It's like the writer / director wants us all to know how much smarter he is than the subject matter. After DAWN OF THE DEAD and now SLITHER, I hope to never see another James Gunn film.

I never read a synopsis, saw a preview, read any reviews... it popped up on the TV and I thought to myself ""Why not?"". Needless to say, I was very impressed.---WHAT I LIKED: Great cinematography - my favorite scene being the bathroom scene (no, I'm no pervert... and no lesbo), the way it was filmed made me totally forget Kylie was nude.Great Comedic Timing - The best homage to the cheesy 50s monster movie was the scene when Brenda was in the barn... I burst out into laughter at her size. Jokes were well-placed and clever.---WHAT I DID NOT LIKE:Few characters - It seemed as if the script writers felt like including characters, but then decided they wouldn't work as many of them popped in and out... and others came in the last half. Even Starla and Grant appeared to have very little development, but their relationship was played out very well.Bad animatronics - Mainly the deer... I think it's self-explanatory.---Overall, I give this movie a B-rating! :D 8/10",Slither

From director James Gunn, who has brought us such classics as DAWN OF THE DEAD (2004, two stars) and SCOOBY DOO: MONSTERS UNLEASHED (2004, one star) (note the sarcasm) comes a surprisingly great entry into the horror genre. When an alien lands on earth and takes over the body of Grant Grant (Michael Rooker), he starts to impregnate other humans with his alien seed, turning them into deranged, flesh eating zombies.

269,PredatorQueen,a SLITHERing good time :D,10,28 November 2009,"Now, being one of those people that could care less about a plot, I found myself fascinated when this one actually made sense. A lot of the movies on my shelf right now are B-Movies such as PYTHON, SASQUATCH, CHUPACABRA all these different cheesy movies. I like horror movies with Sci-Fi in them. It appeals to me. I also like slashers, but not ""over-done"" slashers with horrible excuses on the killings throughout the movie. In my opinion, all they're doing is raising the body count without thinking. Now, I like sci-fi because of the creatures featured in them. SLITHER is an AWESOME movie, and I'd recommend it to anyone. Now, back to the plot... SLITHER is the first movie that made sense in the Sci-Fi / Horror genre. (ALIEN was probably the actual first, but in the 21st century this was) Movies now days have horrible, horrible plots with some ""airplane crash"", or ""he was a mental lunatic"" etc. These are push overs only looking for more cash. I was devastated when ANACONDA 3 & 4 were released. I loved the first two, but the last two ruined the franchise. JP3 ruined Jurassic Park. Species 3 ruined Species. Tremors 3 ruined the horrific fashion of that quadrilogy. Other movies have ruined franchises too! Every series has a bad-apple persay. There are soooo many bad horror flicks involved with, well, horror. It's a great genre when it's used right. This movie provides everything from laughs, to horror, to some spooks now and again. It's not a suspenseful movie every 2- seconds, but it works itself to a true climax. Horror fans will be ""seduced"" after watching this flick. It offers much more to it. The plot ACTUALLY makes sense for a B-Movie (in my honest opinion this is NOT a B-Movie) because everything COULD happen. It doesn't mean it can, or will, but it COULD. We're not familiar with ""aliens"" and if they are real or not. That's why these types of movies work so well. It's because we can create something truly our own without ""omg that cannot happen."" How would they know? Eh, they wouldn't.'nough said, my fingers are cramping xD. I give this a 10 / 10",Slither

Yes.Yes it is a homage to all those B-movies, anything from shivers to the bob and a host in between, and that is what makes it clichéd... what is wrong with that. Half the fun is hearing those clichéd lines. While the jokes could have been funnier in places there were one or two classic lines. *Spoiler* I am still giggling over the scene where a rubber octopus is being used as a outfit!The right mix overall of comedy and horror to keep both camps happy. Nathan fillion does in fact reprise his serenity role, but is well suited. I have not had as much fun in ages.

271,Insanity1865,Great Sci-Fi Horror Comedy,10,16 December 2006,"I would highly recommend this to anybody who thinks 'Sci-Fi Horror Comedy' is good fun. This movie contained elements from some of my favorite movies: The Blob, Invasion of the Body Snatchers, Night of the Living Dead, and a little bit of The Thing. The plot has a slow build but never fails to lose your interest. Every time you think you know what's going on the script moves in a new direction until you arrive at the truly bizarre climax. The acting is a little weak from the star (Elizabeth Banks) but the rest of the cast is pretty solid and any Joss Whedon fans will recognize the Firefly captain Reynolds in a great role as the sheriff. The special effects work well without being flashy or huge-budget and some of the gross-out scenes are as stomach-churning as you could hope for. Throw in gratuitous profanity, one-liners, and redneck hicks, and you've got the perfect recipe for an alien-zombie-romance-comedy classic. A bit of the bonus for the guys-- there is a chance your girlfriends will like this one too thanks to a well-executed underlying theme of love conquering all. But they better not mind some horrific violence along the way. As a general fan of any kind of horror-comedy, I can't help but give Slither an A+.",Slither

Slither falls somewhere in between. Not so bad that it's funny, and not even close to being on par with the genre classics, new and old. At times I thought is was trying to make fun of the genre (which might have been amusing) but it seems to take itself seriously.It's been a long while since I've seen a movie that didn't move me at all. If you're a hardcore fan of the genre, watch this one - but if you're like me, you could spend your money far better renting something else. Dawn of the Dead, House of 1000 Corpses, and many others deserve your attention, and a place on your DVD-shelf. This deserves to be left alone.",Slither
274,Druzilla,Bill Pardy's in town!,8,15 May 2007,"James Gunn has cooked up a really enjoyable and slimy ode to the low-budget horror-films, in this tale of a southern small town invaded and taken over by an alien plague, leading to all sorts of havoc, gore and zombie-like galore. Think Body Snatchers on acid.All the trouble starts when a meteorite crashes in the woods, and overly-curious redneck Grant(played excellently by Michael Rooker) gets too close and becomes infected, turning into the host of a diabolical and very hungry alien parasite.Returning home, he's unexpectedly unable to attack his wife, the town-beauty Starla(Elizabeth Banks), turning in stead on the general public. As Grant begins his transformation into a tentacle-bearing monster, attacking people and livestock alike, his wife becomes suspicious of his weird behavior and calls on the town sheriff Bill Pardy(wholly under-appreciated Nathan Fillion), who's had a thing for Starla for several years. They head up a small band of cops to try and locate Greg, the town's foul-mouther mayor(Greg Henry) tagging along for the ride.They become all too aware of Greg's fate as they stumble on him in the woods bearing tentacles and feasting on a cow. Stunned, they fail to kill him, taking pursuit and being led straight to a barn housing Greg's first victim Brenda. Infected by the venomous virus she's grown morbidly obese and explodes, spewing forth heaps of sleazy brain-slugs. This is where the gore really takes off, the poor inhabitants now have to deal with both body-snatching slugs and flesh-craving zombies, as the plague quickly spreads across the town. The few remaining survivors now have to fight, and try and put an end to the infestation before it's too late.Hilarious gruesome death sequences and flesh-gorging, Gunn really builds on his 2004 reworking of Dawn of the Dead, and shows what he's capable of. Filled to the brim with horror-references, cheesy hand-made effects and enjoyable characters, Slither is a tongue-in-cheek carnage-fest that I enjoyed immensely. Let's hope his next film is just as deliciously morbid and fun as this one. ( http://blogs.myspace.com/mskarbovik - Movie/TV-reviews, news, etc.)",Slither
275,dkwhite,Fans of Bill Pardy will have fun with this movie.,8,25 October 2006,"As horror flicks go Slither was a great deal of fun with none too few laughs. I really enjoyed this movie. The acting was extremely well done, the jokes weren't forced or faked, and Bill Pardy lent a certain authenticity to the film with his quick wit and fast talking southern slang. For Firefly and Serenity fans, this movie is a must. The movie had some gross moments to it that never made it to all out disgusting. It was made all the more funny because the actors seemed as genuinely grossed out during these scenes as I was.Have fun watching this one. Sit back and enjoy. Note: If you like your horror on the serious and dark side, then this is not the movie for you. There is no new ground broken here. It is simply a well put together movie in which the actors are allowed to make the movie better than this type of movie has any right to be.",Slither
276,tangwen,Heavy on the slime--go light on the popcorn,8,31 March 2006,"I'm a Firefly/Serenity fan, so when I saw that Nathan Fillion was in this, I knew I had to see it. It helps that I love creature-based horror movies, the sillier the better. Slither is crazy, funny, and not scary enough to give me nightmares, although there were plenty of moments when I jumped and squeaked. The movie is fast-paced, alternating lots of running, smacking, or staggering action with dialogue that is only as stilted as it needs to be. What with all the running and jumping and shrieking and sliming, the ninety-six minutes went very quickly. My partner, who doesn't like creature features or cheesy movies, enjoyed my reactions as much as the movie, I think, but he did enjoy it. If you like Nathan Fillion, funny/scary movies, or ...interesting... creature effects, and you have a high tolerance for cheese and a bulletproof startle reflex, you will love this movie. If you object to profanity, especially amusing profanity, or have a serious slug phobia, I'd suggest skipping it.Hint: be sure to stay all the way through the credits!",Slither

It has Natasha Henstrige,Ice Cube,& Jason Stathon. It has more action than this movie. I would give it about six or seven stars. Another silly movie is ""Blade Trinity"".

Everything is well executed and although it may not do well at the box office (12 million tops I'd say) This film has the potential to be the next Shaun of the dead.Also, you get to see the next Bruce Campbell (Nathan Fillion)put on a damn good performance.

So, if you like movies like Shaun of the Dead, Army of Darkness, Dead Alive, Gremlins, Tremors, or anything in that vein, you will like this movie.Or if you just wanna see Captain Mal Reynolds (Nathan Fillion) again on the big screen and wistfully wipe a tear or two away, you can go see this movie too.It's creepy, it's gleefully gross, it's HILARIOUS, and I don't think I wasted a single minute watching it.

Thank God for horror imports and the release of older previously unavailable films on DVD. This is yet another M-TV generation ""remake"" that will bore you to death! It doesn't matter what the team behind this abortion claims, it's crap!

The commercials for ""Slither"" plain p*ss me off, this film is junk don't waste your time and anyone who defends it for being more than a video rental-when nothing better exists, has no credentials in my book to review horror films. I can't believe the amount of reviews ( on this site) for this movie that are good, my guess is either you don't know the genre or you are under 30!

I thought it was silly, and a bit over the top. I did like the performances of Gregg Henry and Michael Rooker, however the others were just... boring.Now I like B movies, I really do, but this was a bit further down the alphabet for me. I saw someone compare the humor and horror in this to ""Army Of Darkness"" and ""Shaun of the Dead"", as well as ""On par with The Re-Animator"". You must be joking. I didn't find this film funny, it tried, it did make an effort, (possibly too much of an effort), but it failed in my opinion. By the time I was hit with the 3rd or 4th one-liner I was rolling my eyes and checking my watch.There were definitely homages made to several other films, which is always cool, kind of like an inside joke for us horror fans. But here it may have just been a lack of original thought. Admittedly there were some nice special effects, good gore, but that can't carry an entire movie. The mutated Grant looked like a cross between Jabba the Hut, and in the early stages of mutation- Chet from ""Weird Science"" (after he was turned into the monster) and one of the alien creature/children from ""The Explorers"". It just didn't work. I thought it looked like something some kid from Grade 5 art class could have designed. Then there was Brenda, the woman that Grant impregnated and chained up in the barn. When help finally arrived she looked like a giant tick waiting to be popped. The design once again was totally unimaginative. A round flesh colored balloon with a face in the middle. *yawn* Now about the zombies- The more movies I see with zombies in them these days the more I wish George A. Romero had a patent on them and was the only writer/director allowed to make movies about them. He's the only person so far to do it right, with the exception of Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg (but that was a comedy). Oh, and Danny Boyle, but they were a different style of Zombie. Maybe Mr. Romero has ruined any zombie film for me due to his ingenious ability to get his actors to moan, groan and shamble about as if their joints are dried up and lacking even a drop of synovial fluid, and their muscles are fighting the effects caused by rigor mortis that had started to set in right before they were re-animated. The people of ""Wheelsy"" just didn't have the proper motivation... they were horrible zombies.So in the end I give ""Slither"" a 3, for a couple of laughs and a few nice gore scenes.",Slither

If you like funny/scary movies, I think you'll find this to be pretty darn good. The main characters had me chuckle a few times, and did a good job with all the ""stuff"" that was thrown their way. Nathan Fillion and Elizabeth Banks were my favorite, especially Nathan...his funny lines were just funny enough, without being too obvious. The concept (for me) was pretty fresh, but also had a B rated feel to it, which I think is the point.6.75/10!",Slither
290,ralpheous,Slither slinks around the point but never quite gets it,4,10 April 2006,"I love horror films. I love great horror films and I love terrible horror films. The one kind of horror movie I don't love is mediocre horror films. Slither, sadly, is entirely in this category. I really wanted to love this movie. It has some really good stuff going for it and the trailer made it look like a real hoot. This is not the case.There are good points about this movie: 1 Nathan Fillion is charming and totally entertaining as Chief Bill. 2 Gregg Henry was fun as the pompous, foul-mouthed mayor, although there was nothing particularly original or nuanced about his performance or the character. 3 The special effects were really, really good. One or two moments of obviously CGed slugs, otherwise top notch. The guy getting sliced in half was really nasty and the closing sequence was right out of Lovecraft.However, there were many things that were not good: 1 The plot was uninspired. About the only original thing was Grant Grant & Starla's relationship. 2 The pacing was terrible. I realize that alien invasion/monster films should have some build up to create suspense, but when your film is an hour and forty minutes long, the first hour should not be entirely set up. Get to the damn space slugs for crying out loud! That's what we paid our money for! 3 The tone was fuddled and confused. The trailer makes it look like a laugh-a-minute camp send-up with nasty effects. This is a lie. There are a couple of laugh-out-loud funny moments, but they are few and far between and don't fit in with the extremely dark themes and gore level of the film. A film this disturbing needs to either be way funnier or take itself very seriously. 4 While the topic and the level of gore were highly disturbing, there wasn't anything actually scary happening in the movie. The ""scariest"" moments were supplied by a corpse suddenly sitting up accompanied by a ridiculously loud and heavy-handed musical sting. At least they didn't have a scene where a cat jumps out of a closet. Even the hunt for the bad guy through the woods at night didn't manage to be scary. If you can't manage to make a desperate moonlit chase for a Cthulhoid space-parasite in the back woods a creepy, scary affair, then you really need to stop trying to direct horror movies.I really wanted to love this movie, but I was let down. The marketing machine did its job by making me want to see it and making me think it was going to be fun. Unfortunately, the marketing machine's job isn't telling the public what sort of movie they are actually going to get. If all you want from your horror is a few cheap jumps and lots of gore, then this movie is right up your alley, otherwise avoid it.",Slither
291,melwasul,Really awful,2,23 September 2006,"What is the movie supposed to be?Horror? Not at all. The story is just too stupid to be a horror. It doesn't even scare a paranoid mouse.Comedy? Dialogs are too stupid and boring. Not funny at all. The monster doesn't even look funny. They did not any funny action. Nothing funny at all. It bored me to sleep which is a great cure for insomnia.The story is so bad which this had to been written by an under-aged child. Too simple, immature and non-creative. Rip-off of all the good horror movies.An alien-meteor crashes. It controls a man. The alien-guy spreads parasits that controls every people in the little town. And the ""heroes"" gotta kill the main alien-""queen"" to stop the spreading. Doesn't the story seem familiar?Only reason I put 2 instead for 1, is the great CGI. The CGI-team was the only who did their job. But else the director and rest of the team should be shot for their bad job. Quit your daily job, non-creative people!",Slither
292,bmwhtly,Too much build up for too little reward.,5,25 May 2006,"I really wanted to like this film. I say that to show how much a flop this film was, I wanted to like it, I tried to like it. But I couldn't. I'd been waiting for some time for Nathan Fillion to get a really good leading role, finally he had one (or so I thought). Also a film with both horror and comedy is an appealing combination. The UK film industry has had great success with this (Dog Soldiers and Shaun of the Dead). You can see the makers of Slither trying to do something similar. Trying, and failing. There are reasons for this. It's not because of bad acting, the acting is very good (Particularly Fillion and Gregg Henry who managed to breathe some life into their characters), nor is it the fault of the effects (minimal CGI and good practical effects). The blame rests squarely with the writer. The main difference between Slither and the more successful Horror-Comedies is character development. Both Shaun and Dog Soldiers take the time to show the characters before the horror begins. Slither tries to do this too, unfortunately there is a problem. There are no characters, they are carbon-copy stereotypes. So the first 45 minutes of the film are spent showing how two dimensional the characters are (Despite the actors best efforts). So by the time you get to the horror film you're bored, frustrated and angry with the writer. Once the horror kicks off, you find yourself watching a vaguely enjoyable bad horror film. But making the audience wait through 45 minutes of pointless storyline robs the film of almost all enjoyment. There are some interesting horror film concepts here, but nothing that makes the rest of the film worth watching.In Conclusion, this film had the potential to be good, if not very good. Had the writers taken more time to write Real Characters. A real shame that they wasted the talents of Fillion, Henry and of course Rooker on a horror-comedy that was neither funny, nor scary. Only Frustrating.",Slither
293,vinegar31,Great Horror/Comedy!,8,8 April 2006,"I just saw this and really enjoyed it. I must confess, I'm a pretty big Troma fan and I wanted to see this partly because the director wrote ""Terror Firmer"" and Tromeo and Juliet"", two of my favorite Troma movies. That said, any fan of the horror/comedy genre should see this movie. Troma fans will get a big kick out of the references to Troma in the movie. The movie is essentially a zombie flick with some sci-fi elements to it. I really hope this movie does well because it was both scary and funny and it didn't take itself seriously at all. I also happen to love Joss Wheldon's ""Firefly"" and ""Serenity"",so it was great to see Nathan Fillion again in a leading role.",Slither
294,pegeseus,Loved it.,10,28 March 2006,"Absolutely fantastic. I went in expecting a cheesy, campy, horror movie and got way more. The script is brilliant, although knowing how Nathan Fillion works, I'm not sure how much might have just been ad-libbed. Production values and special effects went way beyond what I was expecting from a run-of-the-mill horror movie. Up there with the likes of Shaun of the Dead and Dead Alive. Biting humor, killer soundtrack, and over-the-top gore with a cast that has natural born comic timing.Please don't discount this as just another cheesy horror flick because it has so much more going for it.

295,missxking,complete rubbish,1,17 May 2006,I went to see this film instead of when a stranger calls because this film was a rating of about 7. I went to see it and this is the worst film I have ever seen in my life! I thought it was meant to be scary and funny... it wasn't at all scary or gory and funny? if this film is classed as a comedy horror then i think somebody needs to define the word comedy. It had about 2 slightly funny lines in the film but I was so disgraced by the rest of the film that they weren't funny. The trailer makes it look a lot better than it is and the trailer has all of the good parts of the film in it - and these parts aren't even that good. A complete waste of £13.50 and a trip to bluewater.,Slither

From the trailer, the movie seems dull and not very horror-like. But, after watching it, I should get a slap for doubting it in the first place. The film starts off at a quick pace; meteor, guy gets infected, slowly mutates, then everything kicks off. There was more gore than I thought there would be, a lot more. The horror is sustained well, giving the occasional jump. The comedy is hilarious and is equally balanced between the violence and horror. Overall, I'm glad Slither decided to show it's disfigured face eventually on DVD.",Slither

Regardless, Slither is a treat; with my only qualms being the lazy exposition and good-but-not-great love story, this movie is simply incredible, with imagery that manages to be hilarious, disgusting, creepy, shocking, and impressive all at once. The script works in much the same way, with fantastic characters. It may not be for everyone, but if horror movies or dark comedies are your thing, this one's fantastic! And if THIS is James Gunn's weakest film, goddamn, this guy has talent!",Slither
298,cjp2112,Good horror movie that is better for someone looking for a laugh rather than to be scared.,10,25 November 2006,"If you liked ""Shawn of the Dead"" then this movie is for you (though not in a British humor type way). It has a surprisingly good storyline and there is more to it than it seems at first. My synopsis: All around good horror movie with a twist. If you're looking for a scare this is not a movie for you but the dry humor is right on the mark. As such, Nathan Fillion is stellar in his role but the ""reel"" highlight (sorry for the bad pun) is the performance of Tania Saulnier (Kylie) who stands out even in more of a supporting role. She really attracts the eye and steals the show. I'd certainly like to see her in a leading role or two sometime in the near future. Also, if you happen to buy the DVD, the bonus ""documentary"" is priceless. The deleted and extended scenes were deleted or shortened for a reason. The editing job was top notch as these extra scenes certainly would have taken away from the fluidity of the movie as a whole. Again, the real bonus in this movie was Tania Saulnier.",Slither
299,andyandyandypandy,"this movie is a effort to watch all the way through and you leave it with an empty, cheated feeling",2,15 December 2006,"I was really looking forward to seeing 'Slither', and got it on DVD to watch with friends, but as much as i stuck up for the film with comments like ""its going to get good in a minute"" etc, it really didn't. There was not a lot funny about the film, a couple of funny lines doesn't make a film a comedy. The acting was rubbish, the characterization was very poor, who are they and why should i care if they get their head blown off? When the action does start, its very hard to care about who dies and who doesn't and your grateful that something is actually happening in the film to keep you awake, it hardly did that, but i wanted to watch it through seeing as I had started it. The film eventually sits back and lets its over-the-top violence carry it the rest of its duration. Nothing works, the sheriff just swears all the time inappropriately, the occasional 'scary moments' are easy to spot through generic conventions, but fall flat due to the poor film making - I don't know about you, but I like to feel scared when I see a horror film, and to be honest, the first Lord Of The Rings was much more frightening, and thats a family fantasy. I am not very fussy, I just ask that people who provide entertainment for the masses should put a bit of passion into it. Don't make my mistake - I was a complete sucker for the advertising, well done the marketing team. Please save yourself the trouble of watching this, save your money for productions where effort, thought and skill has gone in. I am giving it two out of ten, because it does have a couple of funny lines and a couple of the deaths were inventive.",Slither
300,william-bolshaw,Excellent Creature Feature from outer space!!!!!!,8,1 November 2006,Slither was an excellent film after watching it i would definitely recommend it to people who enjoy the genre. The humour was subtle but very witty. If you enjoyed the original Tremors Movie and believe it cannot be topped Slither may well be the best contender yet!!!!!!!!!!I believe the intention of the director was to recreate the 80's Creature feature and he did without a doubt.The acting is really quite good with Nathan Fillion as a very worthy hero. The film is very Gory so is definitely not appropriate for anyone under 15 in my opinion but its definitely a movie that you watch with the curtains closed the sound up loud and a ton of junk food and beer.,Slither
301,revgutterat,fun for the whole family... maybe not,9,1 April 2006,"Slither was, by far, James Gunn's best work since Tromeo and Juliet. It does seem, from first glance, as just a remake of Night of the Creeps with a heavy nod to Cronenberg's The Fly but, as the movie progresses you can see influences from all over sci-fi, horror, gore, and B movie genres. Thankfully, Gunn only went for the ""jump out and say boo"" type scare twice (and one of those is in the preview) and left the horror to content. The movie was funny without being over the top funny and they definitely made a lot of the gore funny. There were 2 wonderful cameos for all the Troma fans out there but I'll let you find those for yourself (don't worry, you won't miss them).

Last night I saw a special screening of Slither at the Chicago Horror convention. I'm a huge Firefly/Serenity fan so of course I heard about the movie because of Nathan Fillion being in it, but with the way the preview looked it looked not so good. Well when I heard that Nathan was going to be in Chicago for the Horror convention of course I went, I live in Chicago. So first was the panel with writer/director James (DAWN OF THE DEAD) Gunn, Nathan (FIREFLY) Fillion, Michael (HENRY) Rooker, Gregg (BODY DOUBLE) Henry, Jenna (The Office) Fischer and Elizabeth (SPIDER-MAN) Banks, plus producers Paul (WHITE NOISE) Brooks and Eric (DAWN OF THE DEAD) Newman. They were all really nice especially Nathan and James. Later I was able to get their autographs and I got my picture with Nathan which let me tell you that man is so gorgeous in person.Well after that panel I was thinking OK so maybe the movie seems a bit better then I thought it would be. So after getting the autographs I stood in line for the preview showing of the movie. Felt like we waited forever. Once we finally got to the movie threatre we still had to wait but James Gunn, Jenna Fischer, Michael Rooker, Gregg Henry plus Lloyd Kaufman were all in the audience with us. James said a few words before the movie starting. Once the movie started it was filled with so much. The audience kept on laughing and cheering at certain parts. The movie sucked you in like you wouldn't believe it to. It was filled with so much humor and some horror and of course a lot of gore and thinking ewww that's gross. BUt all in all I was very surprised at how much I enjoyed this movie. This movie truly is probably my favorite horror movie ever, which OK I wasn't scared at all during it so on the scary factor it's not scary just creepy but usually movies like this are pretty stupid but not this one. I'd suggest everyone to see this movie! And even if you don't think it looks good (which I didn't) see it anyways, and see it to support the actors and those behind the movie because they truly are great people. The whole time during their panel they kept on making the audience laugh and cracking jokes. Truly amazing people!",Slither

Well, tho be honest, i didn't expect much and i didn't get much either. It one of those classic sci-fi movies from the end of the 80' and beginning of 90' where a nasty beast comes from outer space, infects a earth being and starts spreading around. Usually it all looks very disgusting...The good thing in this movie is, that it doesn't take all situation too seriously and looks like a parody on it self. Especially Nathan's humor makes it worth watching even though it is not some kind of premium cinema masterpiece.

The actors are a bit overacting, but what would you expect from Nathan Fillion, who plays the same role he played in Serenity: a disillusioned guy making smart-ass comments.

The plot never slows down, the characters are hilarious, the music is a perfect match with the atmosphere, and it feels like I was only in the theatre for about ten minutes.One of the things that makes this movie great is that it's virtually drama-less. Not to say that drama is bad, but what I mean is that this movie plays like a real story. That is to say, if aliens ever took over a small redneck town, this is exactly how the people would react. There's no scenes of ""Leave me, save yourself!"" and the usual ""No, I won't leave without you!"" response, with the typical climax music in the background. It's just people surrounded by bad stuff and trying to keep their heads.This movie is gross and funny, end of story. If you don't like either of those topics, you're going to regret watching it. And no, it's not ""Tom Hanks falls in love"" funny either. But if you go into the theatre with the right attitude and a knack for gross-out horror-comedies, this one will have a spot on your shelf.

I was fairly eager to see the movie, but when I got there and started watching it, it seemed as though I had to force myself to calm down. The movie had me giggling and appreciating comedy in horror that hasn't been done well in quite a long while.Eli Roth adds great humour to his flicks, but relies to much on pot and sex jokes. Don't get me wrong, Hostel was a fantastic fun ride, but Slither...somehow comes across as classy next to most everything else. It's well paced and knows where it's going and how it's going to get there. The movie has everything a horror flick should have, plus a ton of character.Sadly this will probably bring an onslaught of imitators who try to be corny and freaky at the same time, but as always they'll be forgotten. I think Slither has the ability to stick around a while. It has cult classic written all over it.As a bonus, the film can now boast my favorite kill in any movie ever.

The special effects are very solid especially the main evil mutant ""thing"" from Space. Most films of this genre in recent years have been LAME to say the least but this one sets itself apart and not just because of the gratuitous teenage breast shot either its spooky funny and well done.

But actually it's more of an insult.I can't remember the last time I was rooting this much for a slimy monster to kill all the ""good guys"". I'm trying hard to find a redeeming quality ... uhm, maybe the effects weren't too bad. But for me, this is not much to judge the quality of a movie. I can live with old western movies, in which cowboys just grab their chest, say ""uurgh"" and fall down. If I care for the characters, enjoy funny moments or am otherwise entertained, I can disregard the absence of special effects. But in this movie, it was the other way 'round.

Nathon Fillion and Elizabeth Banks did a terrific job, as did Michael Rooker.There are only two things I found wrong in the movie. One is that it seemed to lack enough character development. They never fully developed the two main characters, but they did develop Michael Rooker's character well. The other thing that I found wrong was that it was pretty slow in the beginning.

The story is fairly basic, as monster movies go, but what makes this film really special is the clever script, the good acting, (especially from Nathan Fillion and Michael Rooker) and the fan-freaking-tastic special effects. It's definitely not a film for the weak of stomach, (it does actually *earn* that R rating) but for those who can gut it out, (forgive the pun) it's a fun-filled roller coaster ride of comedy, horror and great tributes to classics in the genre, too.This film is totally worth seeing, and is completely worth spending the money to see it in the theatre.

So I was very pleasantly surprised by Slither, which is pretty freaking gory, and mostly scary in the aforementioned manner, but sooooo hilarious. It was a simple story idea, not over-plotted as so many genre movies are, with good pacing and funny, crisp dialogue. And then, of course, there's Nathan Fillion, who couldn't have been more perfectly cast as the smitten, not-quite-bumbling police chief. The R-rating allowed for ""strong language"", so it was awesome to hear Captain Mal cutting loose. Actually, I felt like the language gave the film a realistic edge, in terms of how normal people might react to scurrying squid-men and post-apocalyptic carnivorous deer, among other zombie-related atrocities. All in all, a thoroughly entertaining horror flick, even for non-horror fans. I definitely don't recommend eating while watching, though, as that might trigger your gag reflex.",Slither
314,girlyskin,Cheap and gory fun,6,3 April 2006,"About twenty minutes into the movie, one of the ill-fated townsfolk of Wheelsy sits on her couch, watching The Toxic Avenger, a clear indicator to anyone familiar with that movie or any of Troma's other films the direction in which this movie is headed. This movie is not high art. I'm not even sure it's low art. What it is, and all that it aspires to be, is low-grade and unapologetic gross-out fun.In a plot line familiar to anyone with even a passing interest in B-movies, a meteorite lands near the town of Wheelsy, TX, on the opening night of deer hunting season. While most of the town is off celebrating, something that looks like the universe's biggest snotball crawls out of it and shoots a parasite/alien/THING into the chest of the town's richest citizen, Grant Grant (Michael Rooker). Soon enough, Grant begins to act rather strangely, craving raw meat, developing unexplained rashes, and making sweet sweet love to his wife, Starla (Elizabeth Banks). Pets start disappearing around town, then livestock, and then a local woman, who was last seen with Grant. The police, led by Sheriff Bill Pardy (Nathan Fillion) and about as bumbling as a group of yokels can get, investigate and everything is downhill for them from there, aided in no doubt by the slime left behind by the killer alien slugs they happen across in the most disgusting way possible.It's not all blood and guts and gore, though...well, okay, maybe it is for the most part, but all the special effects in the world would add up to nothing if the movie didn't have a fantastic cast. Both Fillion and Banks are perfect in their roles as the lovelorn, slightly befuddled cop and the perky schoolteacher who just wants her husband back. The supporting cast is just as fabulous, from the spunky teenager who's the only one with the knowledge of how to defeat the alien to the foulmouthed mayor to the zombie drones who declare their love to Starla at every chance.Slither isn't scary enough to be a straight-up horror film, but it doesn't try to be. It's ancestry lies not in anything by Wes Craven or John Carpenter, but in the movies that used to be featured on USA's Up All Night program.

Nathan Fillion is perfect as the local chief that can't believe what's going on, and Gregg Henry has the meatiest comedic role as the mayor. The rest of the cast is mostly what you would expect from a B-movie.

317,adreasoni,Slither,10,26 April 2006,"This movie looks like an 80's movie. A kind of Gremlins with more blood and more hilarious moment. Actors are very great and story too. We don't see any zombies because there are a lot of zombie movies like Night of the Living dead and his remake. I think there are too much zombie movies and it's always the same story. So, SLITHER is a way to prove that these kind of film is over. I saw twice this movie because it inspired me for my production. This production deals about strange things and SLITHER was a little bit a solution to inspired myself.Go to see this movie because it's very funny and bloody.ROMAN SONI",Slither

Did you ever see 'The Hills Have Eyes', thats what I call a scary movie, or 'Silent Hill' thats what i call an excellent movie. Although there was some humour in Slither that only made me giggle which is why i rated it 2. Some scenes were disgusting, i couldn't imagine how original it was for worms to be in their brains? Thats stuff 4 year olds think is scary, only come to find out they put it in an R rated movie? If it wasn't for all the love scenes and stuff, I'm not sure it would be rated R. Probably like G , lol. I was actually also a bit disappointed with the humour. They make it seem as if their making fun of horror movies and people take it as one big joke. Not too sure those are the results their looking for. For all of those who watched Slither may not agree with me cuz they get really into the blood and gore. I was laughing so hard at how pathetic it was when that girl was stuck in the car with her family surrounding her, their voices sounded soooooooo fake it was hilarious at the attempt to scare me, lol. I'm tellin ya ppl, this movie should NEVER have been made.",Slither

320,roguewanderer,A new cult classic in the making,8,30 May 2006,"I didn't have high hopes for this movie having also seen the worlds' worst preview - this movie had me laughing within five minutes of opening and kept up that level through out. Not a scary horror - more a comedy horror in the vein of tremors and eight legged freaks. I went just to drool over Nathan, but this movie offers so much more. It offers real people populating a town, not just ""hollywood's"" version of ordinary people. It has a very high level of gore and i definitely would not recommend eating during this movie and I have a strong stomach. You have been warned!! Actually believable gore scenes with a great soundtrack . Also at the end of the credits and i do mean the very end of the credits after announcing a soundtrack is available is a little teaser ending. A definite must see.",Slither
321,kalvinharp,Rip off of many other horror flicks !!!,4,10 July 2008,"Despite the unusually high movie rating, I much disliked this film. My first beef with this film is with the Director himself. My all-time favorite horror movie is Dawn of the Dead (1978). James Gunn completely shamed the original with his remake.The real problem I have with this film is the over use of CGI effects in place of storyline. The story line is almost completely based on The Puppet Masters (1994) starring Donald Sutherland. If a person were to combine Dawn of the Dead (2004) with The Puppet Masters (1994) they would most certainly get this pile of garbage.In the good old days of movie making film makers and directors did not rely on CGI to tell the story. They instead relied on props, puppets, and special effects. For instance look how much more real the gore scenes look in the original Dawn of the Dead.Many will criticize my review of this film and say a movie such as this one is almost completely sci-fi and cannot be forced to rely only on props, puppets and effects. To these people I point out and use two great horror films. Alien (1979) & Aliens (1986) both starring Sigourney Weaver.",Slither

The original copy of this movie should be burned and the director should be ashamed for wasting the time of the few people who had the unfortunate experience of this eye vomit. Army of Darkness was stupid enough for the world of horror. You, Mr. Director man have decided that Army of Darkness needed a retarded little brother named Slither. There is only 1 way I can spoil this movie for any poor soul out there. Step 1: remind them of the worst gastrointestinal flu they have ever had, remember what the toilet water looked like?

Yet Interesting.,7,23 May 2006,"For a horror movie Slither is pretty good, of course the trailers and teasers weren't misleading when they quoted the film as being ""Shocking & Digusting"". But yeah, Slither certainly had it's top moments along with it's fair share of downsides. I found the overall story of this ""Devourer"" (The Nameless Evil) that looked like a needle interesting. Sure this film has a mass of criticism in the forums, but considering everything has been done throughout the history of cinematography this film is pretty close to original as you can get. Anyway... This devourer that goes from planet to planet devouring everything. The basic story behind the menace wasn't original but the breeders, worms and unified zombie thing was added into the works to tell the story you see on screen was very well done!The only downside that I found was the duration of the film. But on a plus side I suppose it very fast-paced.My final reservations on this film...""Creepy. Yet Interesting.""Final scoreAt Best: 89% At Worst: 45%Because IMDb doesn't rate in percentages I gave it 7/10.",Slither
325,JosephJones84,I can't remember the last time I was THIS DELIGHTED with a movie!,10,2 April 2008,"I can't even remember the last time I was so positively surprised by a movie. Never before have I been so delighted with this genre of movie either.It hearkens me back to the old movies of violent humour, shock horror, deathly suspense mixed with fine acting and a great fun scary crazy INSANE monster/alien plot, such as the Gremlins & Tremor movies.But wait.This was Better.WAY BETTER...In fact I really believe SLITHER should be heralded as the new cult classic for Monster/Black Comedy ""B-Movie"" (NOTHING being sub-par however, quite the contrary) flick of the 21st Century.Why? Glad you asked: The opening and first few minutes of the movie introduce the town and the townspeople. The directing is seamless and you really feel you're entering this small American town with its few but diverse kinds of townsfolk.It gives you time to get used to the southern accent (for those of us not from the US).You are subtly but very effectively lulled into a slower pace. And this works hugely to the following scenes' advantage.Then a well paced build up of events and character explorations ensue with a get together at a party. Meanwhile odd things are happening elsewhere.Then you are suddenly sucked into the movie forgetting all else around you. You find yourself jumping at the sudden shocks, DELIGHTING in the look & sound of the creatures once they're visually revealed, ENJOYING the hilarious subtle touches of violent comedy, believing and wanting to know more of the character's and their developing interactions, and grossed out yet strangely cheering the disgusting, the vile, and the gruesome attacks/deaths/attempts by these classic b-movie creatures in all their forms.But before we get into the ""baddies"", lets explore the stellar cast of ""goodies"":I have to admit I'm a big fan of Nathan Fillion, ever since Two Guys, A Girl & A Pizza place & Firefly/""Serenity"".However this film is this ""sucking-in-to-enjoy"" & the acting so well-rounded that you hardly ever see Nathan Fillion - you see Bill Pardy, chief of the local police department.I laughed out loud a bunch of times at the highly entertaining Gregg Henry as the Mayor, with his sceptical pessimistic humour.Elizabeth Banks does a fine and convincing job playing Starla, the wife of Grant (the first victim of the alien ""things"")And all of the other cast members provided a thoroughly believable and convincing performance backdrop to the main events.In truth this movie was a real ensemble piece. You never feel ""This actor has too much screen time"". You never get bored of any of the characters..ever.Indeed if you're like me you'll be surprised, delighted, and shocked at the developments/happenings of/to the characters.Back to the ""baddies"" of this crazy slug ride:I loved the oozing squidgy sounds of the worm things. And the idea that they attack the body by entering it and moving to the brain, thus controlling the host from there is a wonderful imaginative play on the reality of worms in the brain of modern man (particularly raw/smoked meat eaters).I found the ""squid man"" a visual awe-inspiring disgusting thing. & enjoyed the creative murders even more (Slicing a man up the whole of his middle...guts soon roll out!) But my FAVORITE, a truly awesome HILARIOUS take on a classic monster, was the hosts, the zombie hosts.If you're about to watch this, be SURE to check out their had-me-in-stitches way of walking. ITs truly ridiculously stupid! But it WORKS SO WELL in the context of this movie. There's a great touch of boils, blood, oh and don't forget the acidic puke that they can spew at a range of maybe 10 feet.Truly wonderful creations by the director, writer etc. Isn't it great that the best monster is zombies.Not just scary. Not just stupid-funny. Not just lifeless.These zombies are a good metaphor for the whole film: A PERFECT and unique mix of innovative features, horror, humour, character, and drive (or plot if thinking of the movie instead of the zombies).The director has done a truly remarkable REMARKABLE job of bringing an interesting script to LIFE.This movie feels ALIVE. That's the best way I can sum it up.If you enjoyed the Tremor movies or any of the old classic monster/creepy-crawly movies, especially those with the perfect touch of humour...YOU'LL LOVE THIS!",Slither

I had seen the trailer for this 2 months back play before a movie two months back but forgot all about it until I was at the con and saw there was going be a special screening. Me and my wife had to see it. We love horror and this was our first time being at a special screening. So we were both jazzed.We were not disappointed.This film is a homage to a bunch of horror classics and James Gunn is from the Troma school of horror so there are of lot of sly winks to them and a lot of out there dead pan humor to the movie. This isn't a rip off of Night of the Creeps.Before the movie started the director James Gunn said a lot of heart went into the movie by everyone involved and you can definitely tell. The crowd that was there for the screening were laughing at the jokes and the humor and ohhh at the gross out parts. This is the best crowd I've been in for a movie in a long time since the 40 year-old Virgin. Those type of crowds seem to be diminishing for some reason. But not that night. From what I can tell everyone either liked or loved the movie. I'm kicking myself that I missed the panel for the movie. I did get to ask Mr Gunn a question as we were leaving and my wife got to get a picture of em along with Jenna Fischer and Micheal Rooker(who was giving him bunny ears lol).I will definitely go to see this again when it comes out on March 31. We need to support more film like this so studios can get it in there head to give money to Directors like Mr Gunn, and not hacks like Uwe Boll.I just saw the TV spot for the movie the other night.

More so, where was the horror? I've been more terrified by a baby holding a carebear than I was at any point throughout this entire film, to top it all I didn't laugh at a single part of the movie unless it was down to the sheer stupidity of some of the scenes.I'm not one to comment on movies often but this was horrifically disappointing and I feel robbed of a very valuable 1 & 1/2 hours of my life.Cheers, James Gunn, you really made my weekend.No, really.",Slither

James Gunnn should be applauded for getting everyone on the same page. Slither is hilarious. Perfect blend of humor and gross out horror. Good cheesy hick dialog reminded me a lot of Dead And Breakfast only a lot more polished here. Sadly it did not do well in the Box Office. Anyone who is a fan of early Raimi and Jackson needs to see this flick otherwise Gunn might have to feed his family by writing another Scooby Doo movie (yuck).

I was ecstatic to find Nathan Fillion in the lead role of Wheelsy Police Captain Bill Pardy, having been a fan since his days as Caleb in Buffy. Fillion had some very funny bits and lines, as did Michael Rooker as Grant Grant, but the best of the lines went to Gregg Henry as mayor MacReady. And, of course, Elizabeth Banks is just ""hardcore"".There were a few plot contrivances that didn't make since and the Grant Grant creature in the field had a bit of an awkward look to it, but these things were easily overlooked as the film quickly throws the viewer into ""let's just have fun"" mode.

Forget about the bloodless 'Hostels' and other crappy slasher movies. If you want a good old fashioned horror evening get 'Slither'. Suspense, the occasional 'heart in the throat' scare, the classic 50-ties 'invasion of the earth' theme, the GREAT special effects (slime and gore a go go)all wrapped up in a great movie. The story is all about a bad ass alien with an attitude who thinks Earth is the next planet to destroy. And what better way to do that then turning the people in mindless zombies...? I don't want to tell too much, you better see for yourself. You won't be disappointed. By the way...the references to classic monster movies are hilarious.",Slither
333,Tyveil,Lots of Fun from beginning to end.,10,3 April 2006,"This movie was a joy to watch, simply great entertainment from beginning to end.The premise of the movie is nothing unique. A strange alien life form lands on earth and as we soon find out it's goal is to consume/destroy life on our planet.This movie rises above and beyond those it comes after in many ways. The comedy is excellent. There are plenty of memorable one-liners and parts of the movie had the theatre in tears. The action, well it has that too. These are not your typical slow-moving, brain-eating zombies. There are many different forms of creatures coming to get you. They're fast, they're lethal, and they kill in many disturbing (but highly entertaining) ways. Horror? Well it's also a horror movie and it definitely has some scary moments (my wife screamed more than once). It may not be as scary as some others because of the frequency of comedy in the movie, but it's still a must-see for fans of the horror genre.So, what we end up with is a horror/action/comedy jam packed with entertaining scenes. I haven't even started to mention the in-depth cast of characters that help to add a lot of flavor to the show.If you're looking for a movie that nearly everyone will have a good time watching, this is it.",Slither

It's quite simply an homage to old campy horror movies. Don't watch 'Slither' expecting excellent-quality film or even a horror movie scare. It's campy, humorous, and fun.Quite simply, this movie is about an alien race that comes to earth and infects people. Their infant stage is a short, thick red worm-like creature that enters people's bodies and turns them into zombies. The next stage up makes its home inside a human's body and turns them into monsters, so to speak. Then, there's the leader. That's all I'll say. This alien race ends up in the town of Wheelsey, where a schoolteacher, a police officer squad, the mayor, and a teenage girl try to save the town. Sound campy? Well you bet it is. Filled with fairly good special effects, a fairly unknown cast, comical and memorable quotes, and enough gore to make today's horror audience happy, 'Slither' is just plain fun.",Slither

And, with its sarcastic local sheriff, explosively-tempered mayor, wiggly wormy creatures, and nasty Michael-Rooker-meets-the-Thing monster at its climax, it sure didn't disappoint me... or the hubby.While this bloody tale of killer alien worms and puppy-eating zombies wasn't quite as hilarious as ""Tremors"" or even as smart and funny as ""Shaun of the Dead,"" it was still loads of fun, and I'd see it again in a heartbeat. Especially since Nathan Fillion (said sarcastic local sheriff and dry-witted Captain Mal in ""Serenity"") is the star of the flick, and I'm still bummed that Joss Whedon's ""Firefly"" series was canceled.So, if you like funny horror films, go see this one - if only to give the bottom-line studios a reason to cast ol' Nate in more movies!",Slither

Some of you on the boards hate them, well, you know what, leave the theater. Push stop on your DVD player. Nobody is forcing you to look at them but I like to watch them roll by because I happen to know first-hand that film-making is a collaborative effort and if one person doesn't do their job right, the film could suffer for it.

I was left speechless when i left the theater, as i couldn't grasp the words to describe how bad of a movie i had just watched. I was tempted to leave the theater when Grant was shown as a giant blob that had taken over the entire house, but i had to see the horrible series of events that would lead to his death. The ending of the movie was worse than i could have expected. When Bill the cop used a propane tank to destroy Grant, as the ""everlasting"" grenade was too complicated to use, apparently, i was so disappointed.

It in no way reflects the reviews that I've seen in the press, and I couldn't help thinking I'd missed something. The ""tounge in cheek"" humour was evident but not even slightly amusing, the references to classic B movies were clear but this film in no way lives up to its entirely undeserved reputation. I wish I'd walked out half way through, but I kept hoping it would improve. It didn't.It's difficult to clarify why I had such an aversion to this film. The acting was bad, but I've seen much worse (The Hole springs to mind). The plot was weak, but again, I was once subjected to watching Mothman. I had been led to expect much more from this film, and in reality I was bored for the entirety. After a slow start I had hoped to see an improvement, and I kept hopefully waiting to be either amused or entertained, and it is possibly this anticipation that left me so disappointed. If you expect nothing from this film, then you might find it fills a bit of time. Personally I feel as if I've lost a couple of hours that I could have spent washing garden furniture, visiting a letchy relative or constructing a model of Rosie O'Donnell from boiled eggs - all of these would have been preferable.",Slither

This did not - this just, quite simply is not funny.I would have to say that, alongside Open Water, this is the worst film I've ever seen.

If anything this is just a bad horror movie with a lot money spent on animation and fake blood. The plot of this film is terrible, it has characters telling you major parts of the story line randomly without the viewer ever discovering how they no this. I advise people that want a cheap horror movie to watch with their partner on a Friday night in their living room to get this on DVD when it is released. The two of you will be that bored your chance of scoring will increase tenfold! This film is truly awful - I am ashamed to think that I paid money to go and see it",Slither

It was just like those old horrors but with added humour, there's no mocking element to it at all. Please people I urge you to see this film, it's not for everyone, but if you're into horror comedy this is your movie, but if not don't complain, i'm tired of seeing negative comments on IMDb, I mean one or two is enough but when there's about twenty or so about the same thing then stuff ya!WARNING!

If you're going to make a horror movie, at least make it scary. I think this movie had a really Poor budget, The actors was picked from the second shelf, and did not really seem to be any good at acting emotions like sadness or fear. The plot was even worse than the acting to me it almost seemed like a ten year old put the whole thing together, because I understand how this could be amusing for kids, and should probably be rated pg-13. All these things put together made what I think was a really awful movie! So my advice is if you're only going to see one movie this year don't let it be this one.

This movie really did a great job of paying homage to all the horror movies of the past that were big. I found myself laughing out loud, nervous at times, and just enjoying the whole experience.This by far is the best horror movie I have seen; the movie does not gross you out with unnecessary gore or violence. The movie was realistic in how people would react to the situation faced by the main characters, and the town.The acting was phenomenal, and the chemistry was perfect! One thing I would recommend is that you watch all the bonus material on the DVD. There are some great bonus scenes, and hearing that the film depleted the national supply of latex for a month was shocking!",Slither
352,thehummingbirdflies,A new cult classic!!!,7,10 December 2006,"I felt that ""Slither"" was unique. It had some rather frightening scenes along with plenty of gore and a smattering of truly intelligently written lines. There were plenty of hilarious lines in the movie and references to some seriously classic horror movies. ""Slither"" was not quite what I had expected it to be--in fact, it was produced better than I thought it would be. It's a B movie complete with unknown actors, but the makeup department put some thought into their work, and the camera work was very professional. Bottom line: it's no Oscar contender, but it's a great hour and a half of entertainment. I definitely recommend it!",Slither

The last song was once recorded in a PG version and I'm sure also a PG-14 version as well. You may not want children under 14 watching this film - a lot of cussing. However, if you are an adult you will get a kick out of how this ""language"" is used. The film is fairly predictable but it is so worthy of renting or even buying. They used a great deal of special effects in this film but it is the actors who really get you to love it. I'm sure this will become a cult film and have a loyal following (especially the 18-25 age group). If there are sequels I hope they somehow include the original cast or most of them anyway.

But the film is not as satisfying as the trailer. This is one of the movies that trailer is misguiding. It has no known faces. The hero buy a lot of beef and fed it to his creatures. The only funny face in the movie is the mayor. The bugs shown in the movie is very nauseating. You get different type of feelings by seeing a movie. If you want to get a nauseating feeling go and see this movie. It promises to be great horror flick but it does not deliver. It should be the lowest in the IMDb bottom 100,Slither

356,LordBeezo,below average horror with terrific comedy,7,1 April 2006,"Most horror films are filled with serious people in scary/gory situations. But, here in Slither, in the vein of the cult hit Shawn of the Dead, we see FUNNY people put into scary/gory situations. And this makes all the difference.The film is somewhat draggy when the special effects take over and the characters are, more or less, acting conventionally scared. However, each and every time the characters communicate amongst themselves and make sarcastic or witty remarks to each other, the film becomes instantly entertaining.For those of you who remember the scene in which the cops are talking about finding Michael Rooker's character in the precinct, you know what I mean. It would have been a great joy if the style of that scene, the way the characters acted and interacted with each other, was constant throughout the film. Instead, we get a mostly average horror periodically infused with hilarity.Considering the quality of the jokes when it came to humor, I would have much rather watched a really funny comedy, periodically infused with horror.The film succeeds in keeping the running time minimal and the camp high.Nathan Fillion has a great talent for quick dialog with a sarcastic edge, as evidenced by his performance here and in Firefly and Serenity.On a side note, I think he would have made a great addition to the cast of Kiss Kiss Bang Bang...",Slither

They just didn't appeal to me.Despite all that, I absolutely loved the movie. It was funny and gross and scary and such a good time. It managed to be all those things at once and hit all the right notes.In many ways it is like the movie Shawn of the Dead -- real people's reactions to classic horror movie scenarios; funny, self-referential mocking of the horror genre, etc. -- but somehow it is new and fresh and highly enjoyable.The writing is superb and there are some genuinely surprising moments (both of the funny and scary varieties).

I just wanted to tell everybody how fun it is.I came to the video store this evening, and saw ""Slither"" on the shelf. It looked like the typical trash stuff I pass, along with Steven Seagal movies. But I was so bored that I decided to watch what I thought was a horrible horror trash movie. But what followed was just...incredible fun. The story is old news - alien body snatcher comes to Earth, takes over humans...I think you get the rest. But the movie is made so good and so entertaining that you forget about the unoriginality of the story, because the movie turns out original. And did I mention fun? The cast is excellent. They all do their job convincingly, and deliver performances that are rarely seen in this sort of movie. Just like the special effects. I expected c-movie category actors and lousy special effects; I got great actors and great special effects. This is a horror comedy, with balance between the genres that I have never seen before, and trust, I've seen a lot. This is fun almost as ""Shaun of the dead"" but there are actually scary parts too. You will know what I mean when you see the little girl that tries to enter the car.I highly recommend this title to horror fans, but to the rest too. At least the rest who are not offended by slimy gore, but the fun type - it is not that plentiful in the movie, and I would say it serves it's purpose. All in all, a 10 from me for exceeding my expectations in such a great manner.",Slither
359,uncle_joe-1,Tries too hard,3,3 April 2006,"The bottom line is, this movie tries too hard. It cannot decide whether or not it is a serious movie or a horror comedy. Slither bounces back and forth between these aspects and not in a particularly good manner. The beginning is pretty good, just some bumpkin police dozing on the job and not noticing the meteor. But then it just goes off on a wayward path.It creates the joke of 'Family Fun Day' with that one young family then proceeds to infect the young children, in a complete 360 from the expected. Granted, unpredictability can be a good trait in movies. However, you set up a pretty good joke like that and then, for all intents and purposes, kill off young children(and not even in a black comedy way). I applaud Gunn for being gutsy enough to actually go ahead and kill off kids, something that has always been a rarity among horror but simply works horribly here. I realize he is used to doing whatever he wants w/ Troma but his efforts outside of Troma just aren't good. Also, there is a reason that Troma directors aren't that good, outside of the material...because Troma isn't known for their high standardsThis was touted as the next great gory horror comedy. It's not even rated R for the blood and whatnot, it would probably get a PG-13 for that...just the language pushes it to an R. Dead/Alive this is not. It really wants to be seen as a B-movie homage, so so much. From a Troma guy, I'm really quite amazed at how light the violence/gore is. ESPECIALLY disappointed in the initial infection scene...just a little needle burrowing into the stomach and then the brain? You're breaking some ground there, geniusIt establishes the relationship between the female lead and her husband as not terribly good and then, once he is turned, he keeps spouting off on how much he loves her, she betrayed him, etc., w/ her actually caring. Not believable re: their relationship. The juxtaposition of the countdown to deer hunting season and Grant infecting/impregnating/whatever is real bad considering that it could have been funny but was just...flatSpeaking of which, there's the comedic aspect of it...I think I laughed twice during this: the toilet joke and the nodding joke(both of which were the same scene). Nathan Fillion is a pretty good comedic actor and he is just wasted here.I think the best comparison for this movie is Undead, another 'next great horror.' Highly touted and lots of supposed horror fans were all over it. When in reality it was just an amazingly overrated movie that tried too hard and failed as a result.Not recommended.",Slither
360,henryjason,A little cheesy but good,7,11 May 2012,"Slither wasn't exactly something that I was really looking forward to watching, but it was everything that you would expect in a film of this genre.It's the ultimate B-movie with horror and comedy included. There are scenes in Slither that made me laugh a bit and squirm a bit but it wasn't anything to impress me. I understand that it isn't meant to be taken as a real horror flick but I left wanting to see more. It's a decent rental but nothing that'll really make an impact on you. At the end, Slither is a bit of a mixed bag for me.

The dialogue is way off, special effects are a waste. There's only one semi-famous person in it in the form of Michael Rooker(although if I'm wrong you can correct me if you like). The gore level is OK though, the music score could of done with a little work. Oh yes did I mention the acting: Non-existent, the actors looked and sounded like they couldn't be bothered with this film.LEAVE WELL ALONE",Slither
362,L_Lion,"a mixed bag, and not a full one",3,7 April 2006,"Slither is a horror comedy that doesn't really have enough horror or comedy to qualify as one or the other. It has one scene that is exceptionally good, any number of zingers that work, but very few real scares and not enough humor to maintain the movie. In addition, the script does not focus on the hero and heroine, and goes off kilter in several places.A major failing of this film is that it introduces and then leaves its hero (Fillion) to follow Grant Grant (Michael Rooker) as he is first introduced and then becomes the monster. This whole part of the film drags - Michael Rooker's character isn't that interesting to us as a person, and watching as he goes through a series of motions while acting in the monster's interest might be interesting if this was Grant - Portrait of a Man Turning Into A Monster rather than a horror-comedy alien invasion movie. In the final analysis this movie's problems are in the script - it isn't that important to the audience how the monster acts or propagates. The purpose of a horror-comedy is to get the heroes backed up in a corner with shotguns and then throw bugs at them, with them cracking wise every time something frightening or disgusting happens. Instead we get an exploration of the alien's habits and tactics that just makes this part of the movie drag. The ostensible heroine (Elizabeth Banks as Starla Grant) is more central to this part, but nonetheless I felt the movie had left its narrative track, unless it planned on following Grant Grant all the way to the end.When Fillion and his posse finally confront the alien the movie does begin to cook, but once again the problem is in the script. By this point that audience knows - and the characters should know - that Grant is not just suffering from some disease, and act accordingly (shotguns) - instead they continuously parley in the face of increasing evidence that this is not something that ""let us get you to a hospital"" is going to help. Although their reactions might have been human and real, these are characters in an action movie and simply should have done what the movie promised - delivered action. A lack of action scenes in a movie with as few ideas as this is a great failing.*** SPOILERS AHEAD *** After the first confrontation and the bursting of the alien larval sack (a minor character and perhaps the best scene in the movie) the script once again betrays the movie. At this point one of the characters is almost taken over by the alien and develops an insight into the alien. The writer-director (Gunn) chooses as this character a completely new character, rather than one of already developed minor characters. Why? Why did he need to introduce a completely new character more than an hour into the movie that becomes central to the plot? By the time this character is attacked, we know hardly anything about her and could care less about her, even though she is a winsome teenage girl in her bath. Had Gunn decided not to use this character and just used one of the established minor characters, he could have completely avoided introducing her family, and saved time and money. Furthermore, the hero and heroine would have been filled in on the alien's plans without all the additional characters, and could have gotten around to blowing away aliens sooner and with more vigor.My last criticism is based on the movie's look. Gunn is primarily a writer, or maybe it was budgetary constraints, but this movie looked ugly and uninteresting. Most of the action takes place at night in woods or on a field, and the screen simply looks drab. The sets in Wheelsy (the fictional town where the action takes place) look cheap. The whole movie looks cheap. Box Office Mojo states the films' budget was $15 million, newspapers say $29 million, and considering they didn't use any name talent, I would say the money did not show up on screen. The monster is just repulsive, and rarely looks deadly.The last criticism is primarily based on the reality of the character's actions. By the time Fillion and Co have begun hunting Grant/the alien, one woman has disappeared and Grant is known to have been mutilating animals. At this point I was expecting the FBI or at least the State Police to show up and take over from the hick Sheriff. A woman has disappeared and likely been murdered, and a local has been acting psychotic. Time to call the authorities. But basically I was hoping that would happen because I just wanted some characters who would show up and ACT.Although this movie is ostensibly a horror-comedy, the movie it bears the most resemblance to is Dreamcatcher in terms of monstrous invasion and the type of monster and its intentions. Whereas Dreamcatcher had much bigger problems with story (especially the entire Morgan Freeman subplot) and particularly the ending, in many ways it was stronger, primarily because the main characters were stronger, but more importantly because it looked beautiful. Although that may be anathema - preferring the movie that is weaker in general plot and structural spine because of production values - that just shows you how uninteresting I found the look of Slither.",Slither

He may have chosen this method because he thinks there may not be a sequel in the pipeline, however, he may regret not ending this movie in a classier manner as this would have almost guaranteed a sequel to a story with much potential.On the whole an entertaining and wholly disgusting movie, 8/10.",Slither

Persuade by friends and a love for Nathan Fillon from Firefly, I gave it a try. I found Slither to be a delightful surprise.Slither offered great humor in the style of Evil Dead and Tremors. There is even a scene in the beginning that is very Raimiesque. The blood and gore is actually minimal, and most of the violence is more surreal alien gore. It can be gross at times, but the humor and the few jump out of your seat moments overshadow it.The acting was good as well. Elizabeth Banks is lovely and funny as the devoted wife. Nathan Fillon takes the lead as the wise cracking police officer. But it's Gregg Henry that steals the show as the unstable, foul mouthed, Mr. Pibb obsessed mayor.Slither gets 9/10 from me because, why'll good, it doesn't have the most original story and it still ranks one below Evil Dead on the horror comedy scale.

I am a fan of both, and a fan of both Gunn and Koontz. Obviously there are many differences between the two also, as a short story would need to be transformed and changed to become a feature film.Has anyone ever heard Gunn mention a connection, or inspiration from that story?

You take a step back and watch it with a different attitude, and it becomes a really powerful portrait of forbidden and taboo sexuality, with a central premise that comes straight from the core of the vanilla small-town American soul.Great script from James Gunn, and great work as supporting actors from the team that brought us ""Lollilove"".

Horror comedy. It doesn't take itself, or anything in general that seriously. It's tongue in cheek humor with lots of guts and gore. I can think of many, many other horror movies way worse than this one (Event Horizon anyone?). Anyone who wants to laugh, have a good time, and see guts fly (the make-up in the movie is top notch, and computer generation is used only if it is needed)go see the movie. Some of the actors included in this movie are decent as well. Nathan Fillion (for all you Firefly/Serentiy fans out there) is one of the leading rolls, and I have yet to see him perform poorly in any of his roles (he even played the small part, confused Minnesota Ryan from Saving Private Ryan very well). So go, enjoy the movie. Just be warned. It's quite graphic. And you should never really take anyone's review to heart. If a movie interests you, go and see it and form your own opinion. Don't let others do your thinking for you.",Slither

379,skloepfer,Great gobs of slimy goodness!!!!,10,10 July 2006,"Once in awhile a great horror movie comes out. It has suspense, thrills, surprises, and gore. Not often though, in recent times, has this happened. Slither is the culmination of great minds taking the best out of horror movies and rolling them into one gooey film. Fans of Eight Legged Freaks will definitely enjoy this film as it has much of the campy humorous conversations that are found within Eight Legged Freaks. I went to the theatre to see this movie after watching the trailer online. I caught my attention, as there really hasn't been much in the way of sci-fi /horror/comedies in the recent years. At least not many good ones. This was worth the 10$ ticket and I will be buying it when it becomes available. If you didn't watch it in the theatre, I highly recommend renting it as soon as it comes out. You won't be disappointed.",Slither
380,acid307,this film is the worst load of loose bowel movement I have ever seen,1,1 September 2006,"I have come to the conclusion Americans really cant make comedy films, not only that I have found that after reading previous posts to this, that the general American audiences have no concept of what is categorised as comedy. In case you don't no I will lay it down for you now, it is something that has makes you laugh. This film didn't even make my face crease let alone laugh, not only that it was so mind numbingly boring I sat for the duration with the same sombre expression thinking I cant believe I'm sitting here watching this. The film has an extremely weak plot, it seems to almost be a spoof of the horror genre, I say almost seems to be because every spoof movie I have seen has made me laugh. The acting is diabolical the script could have been written by five year olds. The only good thing about this film was the effects, but I mean how hard is cgi these days. This film was hyped up in the UK to be the next Shawn of the dead well they couldn't be more off the mark with those comments, I'm actually surprised the creators of Shawn of the dead haven't sued the PR team of Slither for damage to there film due to association to this nonsensical tedious dull film. If you ever take anything in off of this website let it be this Don't WATCH THIS FILM FOR YOUR SAKE. I would have had more enjoyment being stuck in a lift with an incontinent leper who has halitosis than watching this film. Please don't waste ur money and time on this film.",Slither
381,commukitty,I would wait for the DVD,6,1 April 2006,"I'm a huge fan of horror movies and was really psyched about seeing this one. I was expecting the typical zombie romp with lots of aliens, gore and silliness, but it just failed to deliver.The first half of the movie was really slow. I believe in some character development and all, but that's not really what was happening. I stuck through it, though, and was a little hopeful when the alien leech things I saw in the preview started running around the town.Unfortunately, that was about the climax of everything. Saving the day just wasn't as difficult as it should've been when they were up against an army of zombies with a hive-mind, and I was disappointed. I was happy with the fact that nearly the entire population of the town died... but why couldn't I watch? The humor made it watchable, and I admit that it might appeal to people who would be more interested in the story and less in the zombies. I didn't feel ripped off, but it certainly didn't live up to my expectations. It's worth a watch, but I would wait for the DVD.",Slither
382,moulinverde,Wow,9,1 April 2006,"Sheriff Pardy & Starla, even the bastard Mayor, worked their way into my hearts---brain, even! This movie made me twitch and smile, laugh out loud. Any movie where the characters use squid stickers on a map to mark the location of the beastie they're searching for is OK in my book.What a funny, refreshing, gross take on the zombie-making, brain-slug sub genre.I thought I would like the movie, but I actually love it.Brilliant, and exactly what horror needs right now.James Gunn, you go out there and make more amazing movies.",Slither
383,marymakk,"mmmm...Gore, Nathan Fillion, Comedy, and the creep factor",7,31 March 2006,"As someone who has seen their share of ""B"" movies, I can admit this has many of the keynotes of one. But its a ""B"" movie with a budget and flair. I loved the fact that I could watch it and be so thoroughly creeped out and gagging one minute and rolling with uncontrollable laughter the next. The acting was quite good,(Nathan Fillion is great) even if the dialogue was sometimes a bit gratuitous with oneliners and profanity(but thats what makes a ""B"" movie enjoyable, IMO). The effects were good, enough healthy gore to keep you retching and still enjoying it. I was jumping out of my skin and busting my sides laughing at the same time in some parts which was an interesting change. All in all, if you really like gore- its got it. If you have a penchant for ""B"" movies and black humor- its got it. And if you really just need a great reason to watch Captain Mal kick Mr Svennings arse its got that too. I personally loved it, but I'm weird that way.",Slither
384,downpointone,A grossly funny disturbing movie,9,1 April 2006,"For fans of Shawn of the Dead and Peter Jackson's Dead Alive, this movie will get your juices a flow-in. I just got home from this movie and all I have to say is ""Man, I love me some nasty brain eating zombie aliens."" This movie was beautifully written, brilliantly acted, and funny as hell. I would totally recommend this movie for anyone who loves horror and comedy movies. I love this movie so much that I'm going to have to see it at least 4 of 5 more times until it comes out on DVD. Then I'll probably sleep with it. I'm serious, you have to see this movie. You wont be disappointed. Well at least I wasn't. I give it 2 chicken McNuggets up.",Slither
385,kellieash-1,*bleh*,1,18 April 2006,"I was hoping for a bloody good time, but was really disappointed. Of course going from the trailer, I knew not to take it seriously. I was hoping for at least some really funny moments and the only thing and I am being generous here that was positive or funny about this movie, was the Mayor. He was hysterical.The movie itself was a ""yawn fest"". It was inane, lacking dialogue, was without one decent actor and was profusely boring. This is definitely a rental, or maybe even a movie to wait to come to one of the movie channels. It was a huge waste of 90 minutes of my life, but hey I sat through Cabin Fever and survived.I enjoyed a couple of drunk guys in the theater that thought it was gut splitting funny more than I did the film itself. ;) Oh well, it was still better than Hostel and that is something in itself and a scary thing to have to admit..",Slither
386,rosamundefrommunde,Fun with great effects,8,29 September 2018,Just saw the film. I can't believe I missed it for so long. It's fun and incredibly well done!,Slither
387,tmcxny2000,Slither rocked,8,31 March 2006,Saw the preview last night and can't stop talking about it. If you like your silly horror movies. This one's for you. Paying tribute to some of the best . Try to figure out the various movies the writer/director is paying homage too. Keeps you entertained and laughing the whole way through. One of the best in a long time. All of the actors are actually good and believable and you'll get a kick out of the mayor from the very start. The lead actress looks very familiar but I can't quit place her but you'll know her from some where. The storyline keeps you interested. A few new twists for the zombies were great. Go and enjoy I guarantee you will not be disappointed.,Slither
388,Nner,Horror is back,9,10 April 2006,"I'll be honest, there for a while, I thought Horror movies were dead. When movies like The Ring, and all the other Ring-clones were dominating the genre's market, I was actually shedding tears. But in the past few years, my faith has been revived full force, and it's because of films like Slither. Filmmakers were ignoring the fact that Horror movies are allowed to have a sense of humor, they don't have to be shadows and creaks for an hour and a half. Slither took advantage of everything it could, and walked away with the honor of being the best horror movie since House of 1000 Corpses. I'm a film student on the verge of graduating, and I had been toying with the idea of Troma's internship program. After I seen Slither I knew that all I want to do is be on a horror movie set, so I'm taking the steps towards Troma this week. Life is good.",Slither
389,theoraclepromo,Slither slithers its way into your heart,8,2 November 2018,"Such an underrated film! Gunn & Co deliver a solid, original & entertaining experience for the viewer; character development was minimal, but well-established in terms of purpose within the storyline. No drag in timeliness of storyline's progression; I was happy to see that a little backstory on the origin / purpose of the parasitic alien entity was worked in, but not over-indulged. The entire cast - specifically Michael Rooker and Gregg Henry - offered memorable and highly likable character interpretations & Elizabeth Banks offers a memorable performance as Starla as well. All-around a very solid, free-standing offering within the comedy / sci-fi horror sphere.Similar film concepts / recommended:
They Live! (John Carpenter c. 1988)The Stuff (Larry Cohen c. 1985)",Slither
390,sandychuck,This movie is awful,1,9 April 2006,"One critic even had the audacity to compare this movie to Tremors. Whoever said that either never saw Tremors or should never be allowed to write a review again. This movie jumps from place to place with no apparent idea. Is it a comedy or a horror? truth is the creator probably doesn't know. The only times it makes you laugh are when it is so stupid that it is funny, and then your not even sure that you are supposed to be laughing. Besides that it is disturbing and graphic. I think that the person who made this movie should make another movie, ""How to fail at movie-making"" or ""what not to do"" -1000 stars.-sidenote, the opening that they stole from the movie. The Blob made in the 50's without fancy special effects and was way better. If you have any urge to watch slither go rent The Blob.",Slither
