0,bkoganbing,Bondurant Family Values,7,2 April 2013,"Lawless is the story of the three Bondurant brothers from Franklin County, Virginia, Tom Hardy, Jason Clarke, and the runt of the litter Shia LaBoeuf. Before World War I the Bondurants made a good living selling moonshine, but now Prohibition has arrived and there are new problems on the horizon for those in that business.One of the most colossal pieces of stupidity that America ever indulged in was Prohibition. We actually amended our constitution so that we could regulate morals. A good lesson for those who think regulation of one's personal behavior is a desired thing. What the Bondurants have to deal with is law enforcement which is in the form of a corrupt District Attorney Tim Tolin.An idea like Prohibition is sure to bring out the corruption in many who see it as a way to take bribes. Tolin is one of those and he has a special deputy in Guy Pearce ready to enforce the law and those who don't bribe. That would be the Bondurants and we have the makings of an old fashioned mountain feud brewing.LaBoeuf has a lot of trouble living up to the legend his brothers have created. In fact his weakness is the cause of a lot of problems. But when a young mountain kid Dane DeHaan is murdered by Pearce that gets a war started.Both LaBoeuf and Pearce deliver some standout performances in Lawless. This is based on a novelization of some real incidents by a descendant of the Bondurant family. The recreation of Prohbition era rural Virginia is well done. Definitely worth a look.",Lawless
1,Leofwine_draca,The potential for greatness,6,19 January 2013,"LAWLESS, another period drama from John Hillcoat (following his excellent Australian western, THE PROPOSITION) has the potential for real greatness. All the elements are in place: stars playing at the top of their game, a fine eye for authentic detail, a story ripe for exploitation, lots of well-directed gritty violence and a real sense of menace and danger. Unfortunately, though, while this film is perfectly entertaining, it never reaches what I can term 'classic' status.The problem lies with Nick Cave's script, which has all the right ingredients – but in the wrong order. The story should be involving and engaging throughout, but there are weak spots that scupper its chances. I mean, do any of the viewers really want to watch the romantic nonsense with Mia Wasikowska and Jessica Chastain? Both characters are redundant and slow the film down whenever they appear, whilst Gary Oldman is almost entirely wasted as a big-city gangster, limited to just one decent scene.Instead, we're given lots of moments with Shia LaBeouf, playing a cowardly younger brother who must learn to stand on his own two feet as the story progresses. I'm no fan of LaBeouf – he reminds me of a greasy Screech from Saved by the Bell too much – but he's actually pretty good here, and he fits the role very well; a nice casting choice. Of course, he's inevitably acted off the screen by a taciturn Tom Hardy and a weaselly Guy Pearce, while CHRONICLE's Dane DeHaan gives perhaps the most underrated performance.Hillcoat adapts himself to the material very well, bringing the dusty rural locales to life and providing some truly hard-hitting moments along the way. The ending is very good, but more scenes earlier on should have been of the same calibre instead of being merely pretty good. In the end, LAWLESS can't hold a candle to the sheer excellence of THE PROPOSITION, although it is a film I'll enjoy revisiting in future.",Lawless
2,SnoopyStyle,Shia LaBeouf need to dial back but Tom Hardy is spot on,7,27 August 2013,"It's 1931. The Bondurant brothers (Tom Hardy, Shia LaBeouf,and Jason Clarke) are bootleggers in Franklyn County, Virginia. They fight each other but in the end, together they fight all comers who threaten their family and their business. Special Deputy Charley Rakes (Guy Pearce) is a corrupt officer. Maggie Beauford (Jessica Chastain) is Tom Hardy's love interest, and Bertha Minnix (Mia Wasikowska) is Shia's.There are great performances but it's Tom Hardy who gives an eye opening performance. He is rock solid throughout this movie. Shia LaBeouf's character is too pathetic and too hyper. I think he needed to dial back his performance. It is gritty. It's hard. It doesn't amount to better but it's plenty good.",Lawless
3,Prismark10,Dumb moonshine tales,1,25 November 2014,"Lawless is set in the Prohibition era of rural Virginia, a state where bootleggers are doing well making moonshine.The three Bondurant brothers have a nice set up with the eldest Tom Hardy having almost indestructible powers. He survived the Great War and here cutthroats and bent coppers are no match for him.Special Deputy Rakes (Guy Pearce) a corrupt, dandy will do anything to bring down the Bondurant brothers and will resort to underhanded and violent means.The film has a well known cast of international actors including Gary Oldman who flits in and out of the picture. What the film does not have is a coherent screenplay by musician Nick Cave.In fact the screenplay adapted from supposedly true live events is inept. Rakes is such a despicable baddie that when one of them gets his chance to wipe him out, he fluffs it. In turn Rakes gets revenge on more friends and family members of the Bondurant's leading to another show-down with him. Darn, I never saw that coming.In fact everything in this film is sign posted, it's directed in a heavy handed manner with even the acting rather on the broad side. The story is not even that original. The film is dumb and goes out of its way to insult the viewer's intelligence.Let's make a deal Mr Cave, do not write any more films and I will not buy anymore of your albums.",Lawless
4,claudio_carvalho,Land and Time of Gangsters and Corruption,6,6 January 2013,"In 1931, in Franklyn County, Virginia, Forrest Bondurant (Tom Hardy) is a legend as immortal after surviving the war. Together with his brothers Howard (Jason Clarke) and the coward Jack (Shia LaBeouf), the Bondurant family has a distillery and bootlegging business. When the corrupt District Attorney Mason Wardell (Tim Tolin) arrives in Franklyn with the unscrupulous Special Deputy Charles Rakes (Guy Pearce), the Bondurant family refuses to pay the required bribe to the authorities. Rakes pursuits the brothers and unsuccessfully tries to find their distillery.Meanwhile Forrest hires the waitress Maggie (Jessica Chastain), a woman with a hidden past in Chicago, and they fall in love with each other. Jack courts the preacher's daughter Bertha Minnix (Mia Wasikowska) and deals a great load of alcoholic liquor with the powerful gangster Floyd Banner (Gary Oldman). Jack shows off in Franklyn attracting the attention of Rakes that finds the location of their distillery. When he kills the crippled Cricket Pate (Dane DeHaan), the locals join forces to face the corrupt authorities.""Lawless"" is based on the true story of the Bondurant's family in a land and time of gangsters and corruption. This movie has a fantastic cast; top-notch performances and art direction, but unfortunately something is missing to be a great movie. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Os Infratores"" (""The Infractors"")",Lawless
5,nogodnomasters,Beyond the point of forgiveness,8,2 December 2017,"During prohibition in Franklin Co. Virginia, three restaurant entrepreneur brothers operate an illegal moonshine business. Unfortunately everyone wants a piece of the pie, one that they are not eager to share. The brothers consist of Forrest (Tom Hardy), the brains and philosopher of the group. Howard (Jason Clarke) is a berserker, and Jack (Shia LaBeouf) is the shy driver. Jack is sweet on a Mennonite preacher's daughter (Mia Wasikowska) who likes his ""bad boy"" image.Guy Pearce plays Charlie Rakes, a one sided unlikable crooked deputy who makes us root for the moonshiners. Jessica Chastain provides a little style to the film as a city girl (former feather dancer) who wants to get away from Chicago and winds up working the restaurant for Forrest.As things pan out, young Jack must suddenly grow himself a set and take over the family enterprise against the odds. Good acting. High intensity.Parental Guide: F-bomb, sex, nudity (Malinda Baker), implied rape.",Lawless
6,kosmasp,Fearless,7,22 March 2013,"Gary Oldman might not be as prominent featured in the movie, as he could've been, but the story does concentrate on the family. Tom Hardy, Shia LaBeauf and Jessica Chastain have quite meaty roles. For the running time you get to see a lot of them. And the movie does cover a period that hopefully the viewer is interested in. Alcohol prohibited? Some might feel there is no movie there (then again that would render a few classics void).The movie did not well at the box office, which would suggest that people either didn't like the theme of the movie or weren't convinced by the casting. Both would be a shame, because the movie does deserve better. Give it a chance and watch it.",Lawless
7,classicsoncall,"""Don't expect no biscuits coming out around here.""",8,16 December 2012,"Set during the Depression era of the 1930's, ""Lawless"" is a bit like your hard edged Western jacked up on illegal moonshine. In tone, it reminds me of the HBO series 'Justified', but set eighty years earlier in rural Franklin County, Virginia instead of modern day Kentucky. I'm not up on the current crop of popular young actors, but the main players led by Shia LaBeouf did just fine here in this tale of three brothers who refuse to share the proceeds of their liquor trade with Chicago mobsters and corrupt local law enforcement. Apparently the picture is based on the true story of the Franklin County Moonshine Conspiracy that ended along with Prohibition in December 1933. Given their sordid and violent history, the Bondurant Brothers (LaBeouf, Tom Hardy, Jason Clarke) eventually settled into fairly routine normal lives, but they must have been quite the local legends back in their day. The violence in the picture is brutal and bloody, and creative elements include that 'surprise' in the jar and what has to be the most hideous example of tar and feathering ever committed to film. Personally I found the picture engrossing but can understand how it wouldn't make everyone's must see list.",Lawless
8,gavin6942,"Great Period Piece, Though Hard to Tell Where Truth Ends",7,20 November 2012,"Set in Depression-era Franklin County, Virginia, a bootlegging gang is threatened by a new deputy and other authorities who want a cut of their profits.I have to say this is a great film. I mean, how can it not be? You have a powerful cast of Tom Hardy, Guy Pearce, the ubiquitous Jessica Chastain, Gary Oldman... and you have it directed by the man who made ""The Road"". That is already a winning combination.And then you have a nice story of violence, romance, crime and set it in Prohibition times. I love older stories like this, or ""Public Enemies"" and ""Gangs of New York"". And it happens to be a true story that probably not too many people know about.My only real problem with it was... where does fact blend with fiction? The book the film is based off of is a historical fiction. The events are basically true, the Bondurant family is a real family... but did it play out like this with the gun fights, slashed throat and more? I am unable to tell.",Lawless
9,jboothmillard,Lawless,6,5 February 2013,"I knew that this film was about gangsters, and from the trailer I saw I was certainly interested because of the impressive cast list, I didn't know it was based on a real trio of crime brothers, and I felt a bit odd finding out the critics gave it a low rating, because I really liked it, from director John Hillcoat (The Proposition). Basically, set in 1931, in Franklin County, Virginia the Bondurant brothers: eldest Forrest (Tom Hardy), second oldest Howard (Jason Clarke) and youngest Jack (Shia LaBeouf), are successful and illegally bootlegging alcoholic spirit moonshine in a gas station with the help of friend Cricket Pate (Dane DeHaan). One day mobster Floyd Banner (Gary Oldman) is seen by Jack shooting a competitor, and returning to the station Forrest has hired dancer Maggie Beauford (Jessica Chastain) from Chicago as a waitress, but they are still visited, on the behalf of Virginia Commonwealth Attorney Mason Wardell (Tim Tolin), by new arrival Special Deputy Charlie Rakes (Guy Pearce), wanting a cut of the illegal alcohol distribution profits. Forrest threatens to kill Rakes if he returns after refusing this, and he tries to gain the alliance of other bootleggers to stand against the lawman, but they have to eventually give into the intimidating actions, and meanwhile Jack is making a fool of himself meeting daughter of the local Brethren preacher Bertha Minnix (Alice in Wonderland's Mia Wasikowska), but she only becomes more interested with her father forbidding them from seeing each other, and when he returns to Cricket's cabin Rakes is there searching and he gets brutally beaten to pass a message on to his brothers. Forrest tells his violently hurt brother to fight for himself, and Howard gets drunk before an arranged meeting with potential clients from Chicago, and when these two men harass Maggie they are beaten up by Forrest, but they only end up returning to slash his throat and rape her. He recovers in hospital, and with Cricket travelling with him Jack try to sell the remaining liquor in Chicago, but their clients double-cross, but Banner rescues them because he recognises Jack, and he knows Forrest was attacked, the identity of the two assailants, their address and that they are working for Rakes, and later Forrest and Howard torture and kill them as a message for their boss. The brothers and regular client Banner move the distillation equipment to the woods so that more profit can be made, and with the money Jack continues courting Bertha, Forrest and Maggie begin a relationship and move into the station together, she does not reveal she was raped, when Jack is showing Bertha the distillation centre they are ambushed by Rakes and his men who followed them, they flee with Howard and Cricket, but Cricket is caught by them and murdered. Jack wanting revenge for the death speeds to the roadblock at the local bridge where Rakes is waiting, the bootleggers and Howard follow after him, Maggie tries to stop Forrest from getting involved because she does not want to see him hurt again as she was the one who found him with his throat slashed, he realises she was attacked too, and at the roadblock a gun fight breaks out. Forrest ends up shot several times, Jack and Howard manage to fatally shoot and stab Rakes in the back, and with all the men dead and the Bondurant brothers surviving they decide to retire after Prohibition ends, and in the end, by 1940, Forrest who lived married Maggie, Jack married Bertha, and Howard married a local woman, and all of them had children, but Forrest walked out one night into a frozen lake and died of pneumonia. Also starring Chris McGarry as Danny and Noah Taylor as Gummy Walsh. Hardy is a great choice as the eldest of the brothers with his commanding and nurturing ways, LeBeouf does well as the sensitive but strong willed youngest brother, Pearce proves a sinister character as the one trying to catch them transporting booze, set during the time when any alcohol use was illegal it is an interesting story, and the moments of action is exciting and well-paced, I personally found it a watchable period crime drama. Good!",Lawless
10,rmax304823,Times Was Horde.,6,21 December 2014,"It's an above-average treatment of the so-called Franklin County war that took place between moonshiners and revenoors in Virginia.Well, life in Appalachia in the 20s was no picnic. Appalachia so rarely is. A bit of money was made from distilling illegal liquor called moonshine or just shine. The Bondurant brothers are doing reasonably well at it, outdoing their competitors. The local deputy, hearing of this, demands a cut of the profits. When the Bondurants refuse, the deputy hires a special deputy, Guy Pearce, to harass them a bit and make them start forking over the extortion money.Some might say that Pearce was a little excessive in making his demands, what with beating people to a pulp, splashing blood all over the walls, calling people names, carrying a more than usually menacing shotgun, and pomading his slicked-back hair. Make up has done a marvelous job on Pearce. They've given him the world's lousiest haircut this side of North Korea and fitted him out with a tight collar that makes his prognathous features seem bloated with venom. In fact, make up wasn't very hot on eyebrows. Maybe they were in thrall of Da Vinci. Mia Wasikowska, as the cute preacher's daughter that one of the quieter Bondurants gets mixed up with, has no eyebrows either, nor any visible make up at all. Not that she needs it. She's awfully cute.The story gets complicated as it unrolls. The one constant is the pustular villainy of Guy Pearce, who snaps the neck of a crippled boy for something the boy's BROTHER called him. The Bondurants are sorely put upon and it all leads to a violent shoot out, during which the corrupt deputy has an epiphany and the brutal Guy Pearce gets what's coming to him. Not that the Bondurants are sissies. They castrate one of the villains.I don't know how closely the film follows historical events but it's based on a book by one of the Bondurants, which tells us something. But it doesn't spare us the sight of blood. The Technicolor Number Nine doesn't come in trickles. It comes in gallons and for the slightest excuses. When somebody steps on your face with his boot, you bleed. And when he saws away at your throat or cuts off your testicles -- wow! The acting is pretty good. Nobody turns in a weak performance. And Pearce outdoes himself in the explosive rage department, turning it into a joke. Jessica Chastain is very appealing in her wan fragility. I wanted to take her away from all this, even though she'd been a whore in Chicago. I could teach her how to solve a quadratic equation and then she could teach me things.But, when you strip the story down to its armature, what you get is a pretty familiar message movie. If street crime skyrockets, Dirty Harry turns into a vigilante because the law is helpless (Dirty Harry, 1971). When the banks take over everybody's farm, Bonnie and Clyde rob the banks (Bonnie and Clyde, 1968). When the mine owners hire gunmen, the disparate, desperate miners have to form a union (Matewan, 1987). When ""Big Tobacco"" bamboozles the public, we get a crusading reporter (""The Insider"", 1999). When the higher echelons break the law, we get TWO crusading reporters, Woodward and Bernstein (""All the President's Men,"" 1976).The point is that there is a social and temporal dimension to these tracts. If collective sentiments point to a problem, it's reflected in the movies. In this case, we have a couple of closely bonded, honorable people, involved in a free enterprise, and beating the competition in a free market. Then the government intrudes, corrupt but with legal justification, and tries to rob the hard-working people of Appalachia of their freedoms and their hard-earned dollars, forcing alien rules down their throats, conniving behind closed doors -- a familiar fantasy.",Lawless
11,moonspinner55,One more Moonshine Express...this one tarred and feathered in gore,4,28 November 2012,"In 1931 Virginia, backwoods brothers dealing in moonshine are not so much concerned with their competitors as they are with the new (and utterly corrupt) deputy in-cahoots with the weak-willed local law. Screenwriter Nick Cave, adapting Matt Bondurant's factual book, writes pummeling scenes of violence, all of which director John Hillcoat appears to revel in. For every interesting scene of human interaction, there are two or more sequences of bloody brutality (culminating in a castration bit--apparently played for a squeamish guffaw--which is as purposeless as it is revolting). The well-produced picture has a solid cast, though it wastes its actors on poorly-conceived material (particularly Gary Oldman, in a glorified cameo, playing a suave gangster who just about evaporates). And with whom are we supposed to root for? These siblings, hellbent on retaliation, are just as nasty and ruthless as their enemies. ** from ****",Lawless
12,paul_haakonsen,"Good, but not outstanding...",5,19 December 2015,"Given the rating this movie had received, I was somewhat looking forward to seeing it. Although I wasn't all too thrilled about the cast.Story-wise then ""Lawless"" was adequate entertainment. It wasn't particularly outstanding, nor overly memorable. And I don't think that it is a movie that I will ever sit down to watch a second time.The story is about the Bondurant brothers who run a very lucrative moonshine business. Determined to cut Down the illegal industry, Chicago policeman Charlie Rakes will go to extreme lengths to be successful.While the movie does have some fairly big names on the cast list, it wasn't the lead actors who were the most memorable in the movie, nor were they the ones who actually carried the movie. In my opinion it was Gary Oldman and Guy Pearce who were outshining everyone else in the movie.If you enjoy gangster and mobster movies, then there are far better choices than this one, because it is about moonshiners and not really about gangsters.Enjoyable enough for what it was and for a single viewing.

A new Special Deputy and corrupt District Attorney arrive in the county causing a ruckus, when they want a share in the bootlegging activities.

14,sunwarrior13,Lawless Is A Great Film That Missed Being A Classic,10,26 March 2013,"Lawless is the true story of the infamous Bondurant Brothers: bootlegging siblings who made a run for the American Dream in Prohibition-era Virginia. In this epic gangster tale, inspired by true- life tales of author Matt Bondurant's family in his novel ""The Wettest County in the World"", the loyalty of the three brothers Jack, Forrest and Howard Bondurant, who sold moonshine in Franklin County, Virginia, during Prohibition in the United States. The film stars Shia LaBeouf, Tom Hardy, Gary Oldman, Mia Wasikowska, Jessica Chastain, Jason Clarke, and Guy Pearce.It was directed by John Hillcoat. In 1931, the Bondurant brothers—Forrest, Howard and Jack—are running a successful moonshine business with the help of their friend, Cricket Pate, using their gas station as a front for their illegal activities. One day, Jack witnesses mobster Floyd Banner shooting a competitor and they exchange looks before Jack returns to the station, where Forrest hires Maggie Beauford, a dancer from Chicago, to be their new waitress. Shortly afterwards, the gas station is visited by newly-arrived Special Deputy Charley Rakes, on behalf of the Virginia Commonwealth Attorney Mason Wardell, who informs Forrest that he wants a cut of all profit made by the county's bootleggers. Forrest refuses and threatens to kill Rakes if he returns. Forrest later meets with the other bootleggers and convinces them to stand up to Rakes as well, though they eventually give in to Rakes's intimidation tactics. He ends up beating the two men with Cricket's help.While Forrest recovers at a hospital, Jack decides to travel to Chicago with Cricket to sell their remaining liquor. Arriving there, they are double crossed by their clients but are rescued by Banner, who recognizes Jack. Banner already knows of the attack on Forrest, as well as the identities of the two assailants; he provides Jack with their address and advises Jack that they are working for Rakes. Forrest and Howard later find, torture, and kill the men to send a message to Rakes. Banner becomes a regular client of the brothers, who move their distillation equipment to the woods and have great profit. The money allows Jack to continue courting Bertha, while Forrest begins a relationship with Maggie after she moves into the station for her safety, though she does not tell him she was raped. Jack eventually decides to show Bertha the distillation center, but they are ambushed by Rakes and his men, who had followed them. Howard and Jack are forced to flee from Rakes's men with Bertha and Cricket, however Cricket is later recaptured and murdered by Rakes.Wanting revenge for Cricket's death, Jack goes to confront Rakes and his men at a roadblock at a local bridge. Howard follows after him, rallying the bootleggers to come to their aid. Forrest joins them, though Maggie tries to dissuade him, telling him that it was she who had found him with his throat slashed and took him to the hospital. Forrest realizes then that she was also attacked that night, though Maggie does not say so. The bootleggers engage Rakes's men in a firefight, during which Rakes shoots Forrest multiple times before being shot in the leg and attempting to escape. Jack and Howard confront Rakes, shooting him in the chest with a gun, and fatally stabbing him in the back. With Rakes and his men dead, the Bondurants decide to save their money and retire after Prohibition ends. Grim, bloody, and utterly flawed, Lawless doesn't quite achieve the epic status it strains for, but it's too beautifully filmed and powerfully acted to dismiss.It had great potential, but due to a poor storytelling technique that causes the film to be rather dull, we merely end up with a film that just looks good. But still,this Prohibition-era crime drama boasts bravura performances, unforgettable characters, moments of shocking violence, and enough in-your-face entertainment that features a unique villain and several great supporting actors such as sublimely evil performances by Gary Oldman as a murderous rival and Guy Pearce as a government agent. As for Jessica Chastain, her performance in this film is commendable enough that her fans would surely enjoy. Between sporadic bursts of very intense violence, there are often drafty, drowsy scenes that struggle to justify their relevance. Overall, it certainly had its moments yet lacks the tension of a real classic.",Lawless
15,hitchcockthelegend,"It is not the violence that sets men apart, alright, it is the distance that he is prepared to go.",9,20 January 2013,"Lawless is directed by John Hillcoat and adapted to screenplay by Nick Cave from the novel The Wettest County in the World written by Matt Bondurant. It stars Shia LaBeouf, Tom Hardy, Jason Clarke, Jessica Chastain, Guy Pearce, Mia Wasikowska, Dane DeHaan and Gary Oldman. Music is by Nick Cave and Warren Ellis and cinematography by Benoit Delhomme.Prohibition-era Franklin County, Virginia, and a bootlegging gang of brothers is threatened by a sadistic new special deputy who will stop at nothing to smash their operation.The directing and writing team behind 2005's excellent Aussie Western, The Proposition, gather again to produce this bloody tale of the real life Bondurant brothers who stood up and fought the law on their own terms. If that sounds like a call for us to side with the good ol' bad boys and their right to fight the bad copper guys, then it is. If you can get past that deliberately grey area, and why wouldn't you in this part of the entertainment medium? Then there is a mighty fine time to be had here.What unravels is a intense character based story that is cloaked with sumptuous period flavours, and by turns it's violent, darkly funny and beating a true emotional heart. It's also exquisitely photographed (Georgia standing in for Virginia) and performed by the cast (Hardy and Pearce simply wonderful), while Cave's music score has the requisite blend of Moonshine Hillbilly twangs with Achy Breaky thrums. The girls (Chastain and Wasikowska) are a touch under written, but in a film primarily about three brothers flexing their muscles and sticking their chests out, it's a forgivable flaw. Oldman fans, however, should note that his role in the film, as gangster Floyd Banner, is nothing more than a trio of cameo appearances.A strong stomach is required and you will need to accept the romanticisation of the Bondurant boys, because then you will get the most out of this impressively mounted film that deals in a time of American history that is under represented (particularly out of the city and into the hills) in the movies. 8.5/10",Lawless
16,Theo Robertson,Commercial Considerations Let It Down,6,11 July 2013,"Prohibition in rural Virginia means bootleggers and moonshiners can make a lot of money producing liqueur . The Bondurant brothers are amongst the most successful moonshiners in the state . Their industry is under threat from Special Deputy Charley Rakes who will do anything to bring down the Bondurant brothers I wouldn't say I enjoyed director John Hillcoat's previous work since they're a bit too painfully gloomy , downbeat and nihilistic to be enjoyed but I did respect his films . Here he has made his most commercial and accessible film featuring the tried and tested genre of the gangster film which is always popular with the public . Based upon the book The Wettest County In The World by Matt Bondurant . Hillcoat has made a film with commercial appeal but has probably made it a bit too commercial for the American box office for it to be a truly hard hitting and memorable film that the director is known for The battle lines are drawn far too black and white . The Bondurants are merely following the business of America which is business and the fact that they're filling a market that due to the stupidity of politicians is an illegal market is neither here nor there because they are essentially real life American Robin Hoods risking , life , limb and liberty to keep ordinary Americans in home made apple brandy . Every businessman needs an enemy and this enemy is the American federal government who have employed Special Deputy Charley Rakes who isn't really interested in upholding the law but does the job because it involves torture and murder . Try and think of the Sheriff of Nottingham fused with a torturer from a Latin American fascist dictatorship played in a manner by Guy Pearce that suggests he thinks he's still appearing in pantomime at Preston Guild Hall and you've got the idea where this might be going wrong You are left with the impression that Hillcoat is pulling out all the stops to give this commercial appeal . Not only are the good guys a bit too good , the bad guys a bit too bad leaving the audience in no doubt who to cheer for but is also trying to make a film trying to appeal to both teenagers and a female audience . We get a charming - it says here - coming of age story about Jack Bondurant who has fallen in love with a girl from the Amish church and we get a subplot about a romance between Forrest Bondurant and Maggie Beauford . In other words the story loses focus and is trying to do too much This is a pity because LAWLESS is an impressive film in parts . The disgracefully underrated Tom Hardy just about the most impressive actor in the world in the last couple of years is good in the role of Forrest and does manage to flesh out his role as just being a misunderstood good guy . The cinematography is beautiful and Hillcoat does manage to paint a convincing picture of both time and place . That said you are still left with the impression Hillcoat is trying a bit too hard to make the film be a massive box office success and one wishes he'd stuck to his guns and made a movie involving a lot more dubious morality and nihilism that the director had done in GHOSTS OF THE CIVIL DEAD , THE PROPOSITION and THE ROAD",Lawless
17,LeonLouisRicci,Leads Are Leaden,7,25 January 2013,"An interesting looking film that is marred by two lead actors, one who mumbles and grunts and has no facial expressions, and the other who is probably the worst ""lead"" actor of his generation and is given role after role and nobody knows why because it defies reasonable reflection.There are some good, quirky supporting roles and are delivered with the believability and intrigue lacking in the aforementioned ""top guns"". It is a dusty movie and has a rural charm. The violence is vehement, and there is some staying power in the weak script brought on by gangland attraction and corrupt revenuers. But it is all quite befuddled and incoherent. It has some intrusive songs that seem to come out of nowhere for some show stopping, time and place, insensitive reason. The movie lacks any chemistry and there is virtually no charismatic cinema. So what is left is something that moves along at an uneven pace with spurts of interest forever being contained by lackluster portrayals, save Guy Pearce, and a story that is needlessly confusing and slow to boot.",Lawless
18,zardoz-13,"""The Untouchables"" in the Sticks!",10,2 September 2012,"""Lawless"" amounts to a first-rate, fiercely violent, but surprisingly entertaining crime thriller about Prohibition-era bootleggers in rural Virginia. Not only does this exceptional 115-minute moonshine melodrama boast a gallery of memorable characters but also several unforgettable performances. Although Shia LaBeouf takes top billing as the youngest of the three Bondurant brothers who brewed white lightning, Tom Hardy is the actor to watch in this rugged R-rated epic about turf wars in the woods. Keep in mind, ""Lawless"" constitutes another of those movies ""based on a true story."" Interestingly, Australian director John Hillcoat of ""The Proposition"" and scenarist Nick Cave have boiled down the essence of Matt Bondurant's 2008 historical novel ""The Wettest County in the World"" for a colorful, sometimes savage saga about the American free enterprise system. What truth lies in the novel is debatable since Bondurant wrote about his own grandfather, Jack Bondurant, along with his two grand uncles and their high octane, Depression Era exploits as moonshiners who refused to capitulate to outside strong arm interests. Most of ""Lawless"" chronicles the efforts of corrupt lawmen as they shake down rural bootleggers. Anybody who doesn't grovel pays a terrible price. These sadistic dastards with badges tar and feather one unfortunate bootlegger and leave him for dead on his kin's front porch. Despite the eruptions of sudden, noisy violence that will startle some and shock others, ""Lawless"" has more than its share of quiet, introspective moments to offset its bits of Sergio Leone style violence. Indeed, Hillcoat and Cave squeeze in to two love stories. Cinematically, this atmospheric yarn looks like the Coen brothers' Depression-Era opus ""O Brother, Where Art Thou,"" but it takes itself far more seriously. Just as ""O Brother"" was inspired by Homer's heroic poem ""The Odyssey,"" the characters and circumstances surrounding the Great Franklin County Moonshine Conspiracy emerge as legendary characters themselves.Forrest (Tom Hardy of ""The Dark Knight Rises""), Howard (Jason Clarke of ""Public Enemies""), and Jack (Shia LaBeouf of ""I, Robot"") are the brothers Bondurant. Howard survived World War I as the one man in his regiment who didn't die. During the pandemic 1918 Spanish Flu influenza, neither Howard nor Jack contracted the fatal illness. Miraculously, Forrest recovered from it but their parents perished. Forrest believes his brothers and he are invincible, and the events that unfold in ""Lawless"" make that description of their longevity appropriate. The first time we see the Bondurant boys, Jack's older brothers are egging him on to shoot a pig for them for vittles. Staring down the barrel of a .22 rifle, Jack cannot muster the nerve to squeeze the trigger. One of his brothers intervenes and shoots it; the gunshot reverberates like an artillery blast. Afterward, ""Lawless"" picks up in 1931. The Bondurants operate a money-making moonshine business and use their country store and filling station as a front. Forrest calls the shots. Howard serves as the muscle. Jack sweeps the floors. Surprisingly, the Bondurants even sell shine to the local constabulary. This is one of many surprises that occur throughout ""Lawless"" and make it a lively, off-beat genre exercise.""Lawless"" presents its larger-than-life events from the perspective of Jack. The runt of the litter, Jack struggles to measure up to his two imposing brothers. They are always ridiculing his best efforts. Jack's closest friend is a nerdy county boy, Cricket Pate (Dane DeHaan of ""Chronicle""), who was crippled during his infancy by Rickets. Cricket conjures up clever means to manufacture moonshine. When Jack visits Cricket, he finds Cricket brewing whiskey in a huge still beneath his backwoods mansion in the basement. Cricket pipes the brew up through a spigot at the sink and dispenses it in a Mason jar. At one point, young Jack observes that the fires illuminating hundreds of illegal stills in the woods of Franklin County appear like a constellation of stars.Things change for both good and bad for the Bondurants and their kind. A dancer from Chicago, Maggie Beauford (Jessica Chastain of ""The Help""), hits Forrest up for a job as a waitress. Eventually, they grow fond of each another. Meantime, Virginia Commonwealth District Attorney Mason Wardell (newcomer Tim Tolin) prefers to skim the profits from the bootleggers rather than shut them down. He hires some unsavory Chicago troublemakers with few sentiments about the sanctity of human life. The most prominent is sadistic Charlie Rakes (Guy Pearce of ""L.A. Confidential"") who dresses like a stockbroker. Rakes behaves like a Nazi, wears gloves, dyes his hair black, and arms himself with only the best weapons. He assaults defenseless Jack with a shotgun and sends the battered twentysomething home with a message that should Forrest anticipate rougher treatment. Two thugs arrive at Forrest's bar and inflict maximum pain on him. Later, after other depredations, Rakes kills somebody close to the Bondurants.Director John Hillcoat keeps things moving swiftly enough so the story never bogs down. After the gunsmoke settles and the bodies are hauled off, Hillcoat wraps up the history neatly and gives us a glimpse of what the actual participants looked like in a 1917 black and white photograph. Hillcoat stages several above-average shoot-outs, especially the bullet-blasting finale at a covered bridge. Film editor Dylan Tichenor and Hillcoat have done a splendid job of editing the action scenes so the violence is more dramatic than gratuitous. In other words, the violence may make you flinch, but you won't be sickened by unnecessary gore. The attention to period detail seems scrupulous, too. Hillcoat substitutes Georgia for Virginia. The rustic settings, the wooden barns, and the country stores as well as the clean-scrubbed urban cityscapes with period advertisements give ""Lawless"" an authentic feel. Cinematographer Benoît Delhomme of ""1408"" captures those hundreds of fires blazing against the majestic backdrop of rural Virginia with his panoramic widescreen lens. Memorable movies about moonshiners in the south are few and far between. ""Lawless"" ranks as the best example about rural bootleggers since ""The Moonshine War"" (1970).",Lawless
19,grantss,"Good, but a bit disappointing",7,22 September 2015,"Good, but not great, and more than a little disappointing. Had heaps of potential: the (true) story was incredibly interesting. However, that may be the problem - there is too much to cram into a 2-hour movie. A mini-series may the more ideal medium. Certain events get glossed over. Some development of some of the more interesting sub-plots is required. Plus, we are lead down a few blind-alleys, plot-wise. The pacing is uneven too - better direction and editing was required. This said, it is entertaining. The movie is suspenseful and exciting and has a degree of grittiness. With more time and a better director, it could have been a great crime-drama.Shia LaBeouf is miscast in the lead role - he just doesn't have the presence or maturity for the role. Still, he doesn't do too badly and manages to limit the damage. Remaining cast - Tom Hardy, Jason Clarke, Guy Pearce, Jessica Chastain, Mia Wasikowska - are excellent. Tom Hardy is the pick of the bunch, as Forrest Bondurant.Most underutilised member of the cast must go to Gary Oldman. His character was a very interesting one, and deserved his own movie, but Oldman, for all his genius as an actor, only gets 5 minutes of screen time.Good soundtrack, the standout track being a hillbilly version of The Velvet Underground's ""White Light, White Heat"".",Lawless
20,Boba_Fett1138,"Thumbs up for just about everything, except for its story.",7,17 September 2012,"A good look, some great acting, a nice premise, a great time period it is set in, this movie has it all. However one thing I can't say about this movie was that it was also doing a good job at getting me involved with its story.I always like movies set in a specific time period in the past, especially when they have a great and detailed look to it, such as this movie does. This movie is set in the 1920's or 1930's and it does a good job at setting the right tone for it. It's definitely a movie with a good look to it and you could tell where most of the money went to, besides its actors.It really as an all-star cast in it, with perhaps not the world's biggest actors but more the sort of actors who all are 'hot' at the moment and are on a good streak. I know it's easy to make fun of Shia LaBeouf but in all truth and honesty, this kid always had some real talent and potential in him. He didn't always made the right movie choices but with this movie he definitely shows his potential once more and even more than that; he shows he can carry a movie and play a convincing and demanding role in a more 'serious' and heavy movie. Also actors such as Tom Hardy, Guy Pearce, Jessica Chastain, Mia Wasikowska and Gary Oldman show up, making this a real assemble piece, though in all truth, some of them show up for only about 5 minutes.That perhaps should tell you something about its storytelling already. It isn't always focused and interesting enough. At times the pacing is off and its hard to tell whether the movie wanted to be a fun and entertaining gangster flick or a more serious and realistic one. It doesn't explore certain aspects well enough and pushes some things too much to the background at times. It was hard for me to every truly get into the movie.It seems that the story just wasn't all that great and interesting enough, or perhaps it was written with a different style in mind. Either way, it doesn't make ""Lawless"" the best or most engaging movie to watch, though for most part it still remains a perfectly watchable movie. It remains a capably made- and well acted out movie, that was missing something to let it rise above the level of just average.7/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Lawless
21,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Entertaining,7,12 October 2012,"In the era of Prohibition(who would render illegal a substance which is enjoyed by many, and so harmless if used in moderation? But enough about marihuana, this is about liquor), the moonshining Bondurant siblings Forrest(Hardy in a powerful performance(half of it being grunts, since when he sees the city girl Maggie(Chastain, as determined without becoming masculine... the only two women in this are, indeed, love interests first and foremost, but they're not just blank slates), he goes mute(hat in hand, of course!), and that makes up one of the two sweet, charming romances) the quiet giant whose cool head runs the business and keeps the others in check) and Howard(an unreliable drunk who you do not want to offend when he's had whisky) were legend. They also had a brother, Jack(Shia, who... plays himself, and does so well; his ego is excessive and he's hotheaded; and he courts the priest's daughter Bertha(Wasikowska, in who you can sense an attraction to the more glamorous)), who wants to impress the other two, and his ambitions help drive the plot. They're feared, so the local police don't touch them. One day, a new deputy comes in, from Chicago, and Charlie Rakes(Pearce, as a really cool villain, both effeminate and tough) is out to stop them, whatever it takes. We've seen this stuff before, and some of the things are underdeveloped and feel rushed, like they come out of nowhere. With that said, this is a lot of fun, with many laughs, and a fitting feel derived of the Western genre(very Leone), everyone is a living, breathing being, everyone is just getting along(this is not checked for being PC, it's not sanitized... there's a culture shock in a very interesting wake in the opening scene). There's a high level of detail and authenticity(we even see examples of segregation... and it's not something that is unrealistically ""opposed"" by anyone, it's just part of everyday life), with all dialects being consistent(and with the accuracy, you can tell if someone is from Franklin county, Virginia, or the Windy City). Directed by John Hillcoat, this is filmed and edited rather well. It's engaging, has memorable characters and immensely quotable, clever and humorous dialog, and the build-up to the climax is effective(if the actual ending is a tad bland, and is where what little Hollywood there is in this is most apparent). This has a quaint look to it, it's like looking on an old photograph or home movie, a time passed that seems more ideal. That vision is broken up every so often by the many sudden bursts of brutal, disturbing, bloody violence(that leave bruises, that have people pleading for mercy... we feel every blow, it hurts us), that are so vivid that we almost expect to be sprayed with blood. There is a moderate amount of strong language and a little topless female nudity in this. I recommend this to fans of period pieces surrounding the 1920's/30's. 7/10",Lawless
22,neil-476,Strong and violent,8,14 September 2012,"Lawless tells the story of the three Bondurant brothers, bootleggers in rural Virginia during the Prohibition era. Howard, the oldest, is rather anonymous, but Forrest (Tom Hardy) is a forceful character while Jack (Shia LaBoeuf), the youngest, is rather taken with the perceived glamour of being an outlaw/gangster. He is also the only one who has a razor. Having carried on in peaceful co-existence with the local law, their world is disrupted by the arrival of Special Agent Charlie Rakes, a sadistic and unhinged individual who is prepared to resort to extreme brutality to get what he wants, which is initially a piece of the action, but then things get personal. Mixed in with this are developments in the personal lives of Forrest and Jack.This film is based on a fact-based novel written by the grandson of one of the brothers, hence the inclusion of material relating to the love lives of Forrest and Jack - this adds little to the plot, but a great deal to the mood of the film and to the audience's ability to identify with the brothers - they are always the sympathetic protagonists of the piece despite the fact that they are criminals and, we discover, as capable of violence as the blackly villainous Rakes, who uses his position as a means to indulge his taste for inflicting violent pain on people.This film has an 18 certificate in the UK, and deservedly so: the intermittent violence is graphic and disturbing. But despite this, and despite its leisurely pacing, this is a good film - strong, gripping, and with terrific performances particularly from Hardy and LaBoeuf. The sense of time and place is very strong, too.My only reservation (and it is one I have recently voiced in connection with regional British films, too) is that the accents are often impenetrable which can lead to plot points being missed. I didn't even know what the brothers' surname was until I saw the credits, because you can't understand it when it's spoken!",Lawless
23,Uriah43,Prohibition and Illegal Moonshine,7,10 May 2015,"During the days of Prohibition one particular county in Virginia had the dubious reputation for being one of the largest producers of illegal moonshine in the entire country. It's here in Franklin County that three brothers with the last name of ""Bondurant"" have established a rather lucrative business of brewing and distributing corn whiskey. Recognizing that there are substantial profits to be made, an exceedingly corrupt federal law enforcement official by the name of ""Charley Rakes""(Guy Pearce) decides to travel all the way from Chicago in order to establish himself as the kingpin of this illicit operation. To do that he decides to harass and intimidate all of those currently involved in this enterprise and that puts him and the Bondurant brothers directly on a collision course. Now rather than reveal any more of this movie and risk spoiling it for those who haven't seen it I will just say that this film managed to capture the beauty of Appalachia along with the dismal feel of the Great Depression in an excellent manner. Additionally, I thought that both Tom Hardy (as ""Forrest Bondurant"") and Jessica Chastain (""Maggie Beauford"") turned in outstanding performances as well. In any case, I enjoyed this film and recommend it to all of those who might be interested in a movie of this type. Above average.",Lawless
24,ferguson-6,"Hooch, Grunt, Hicks and Brothers",7,3 September 2012,"Greetings again from the darkness. Gangster and family crime dramas are always a favorite film genre, especially when ""based on a true story"", as this one claims. The story comes straight from the novel ""The Wettest County in the World"" by Matt Bondurant, the grandson of Jack Bondurant, portrayed in the film by Shia LaBeouf. The screenplay and direction come courtesy of the latest collaboration from Nick Cave (alt-Rocker) and John Hillcoat (The Road).The cast is deep and talented. The three Bondurant brothers are played by Tom Hardy (Forrest), Jason Clarke (Howard) and LaBeouf (Jack). The brothers are moonshiners who also run their own bootlegging business in Franklin County, Virginia during prohibition and the great depression. They are assisted by a moonshine savant named Cricket (Dane DeHaan as a dead ringer for Leonardo DiCaprio in What's Eating Gilbert Grape). A beautiful former Chicago dancer played by Jessica Chastain stumbles into their café while inexplicably searching for a quieter life. Mia Wasikowska is the preacher's daughter with a rebellious streak who gets courted by Jack. Gary Oldman is terrific, though sadly limited in screen time, as the notorious gangster Floyd Banner, and Guy Pearce plays Special Detective Charlie Rakes. Rakes is a corrupt, outlandishly colorful character out of Chicago who is on assignment to either get a cut of the business or kill everyone in the process ... all while smelling like a ""nancy"" and keeping blood off his tailored suits. He does this with the worst movie haircut since Anton Chigurh. Pearce plays him like a mix of a Christoph Waltz villain and Willem Dafoe's detective in The Boondock Saints. Quite a visual.With this cast and a very stylistic look provided by wonderful camera work, color scheme, and costumes, it's a bit confounding that the movie isn't a little better than it is. The war between outlaws and crooked lawmen, splashed with minor love stories and interesting characters seems to have a gap. Apparently there are too many vying for too little screen time. Gary Oldman's character has a stunning and violent screen entrance, but then is wasted and ignored for the balance of the film. Chastain's Maggie is carrying a back-story that is clearly very intriguing, but all we get is a few pouty looks.Since the novel's author is the grandson of Jack, we can assume that's why LaBeouf gets so much attention and screen time. He is the family runt, and can't wait to prove his worth to his brothers. Even if this is true, this story line is nowhere near as interesting as that of Forrest, Floyd Banner, Detective Rakes, or Maggie. Whenever LaBeouf came on screen, I felt like I was watching an actor. When Hardy or Clarke were featured, it felt like real hillbillies were trying to protect their moonshine business. Speaking of Hardy, he dominates the screen again ... just like in Inception and The Dark Knight Rises (as Bane). So anxious to watch his career continue to develop.Nick Cave and Warren Ellis combine on the excellent score, as well as some of the fine songs performed by The Bootleggers. The music adds even more to the film's feel. With all of the characters here, this might have taken a step up as a mini-series. As it stands, it falls short of The Untouchables or HBO's Boardwalk Empire. While entertaining enough, it leaves us with an empty feeling and a hokey shootout finale.",Lawless
25,anaconda-40658,Hardy's Laws.,7,16 June 2015,"Lawless (2012): Dir: John Hillcoat / Cast: Shia LaBeouf, Tom Hardy, Jessica Chastain, Guy Pearce, Jason Clarke: Gangster style film based on true events in the early 1930's. It regards the very bottom gutter of civilization as the Bondurant brothers run an illegal bootlegging route that is successful until a special agent arrives to force a cut of the earnings. When the Bondurants fail to comply then violence is forced upon them. Director John Hillcoat is given a great concept marked with terrific action footage that mirror the era. Unfortunately the structure is often predictable and repetitious with the back and forth violent acts. The ending also poises an issue with regards to its position on the law as well as one overlong death in the climax. The heroes are unfortunately criminals but they are portrayed with passion and determination. Shia LaBeouf plays the youngest Bondurant who desires to move from small chores to selling the product. After taking a severe beating by the special agent, he doubts his ability to measure up. He is also courting the Minister's daughter, which leads to trouble. Tom Hardy plays the hardened oldest brother who runs the business and has the ability to survive even the most fatal encounters. Jason Clarke plays the other brother caught up within the war that has broken out against his family. Jessica Chastain plays a waitress working for Hardy who comes to his aid during a fateful evening. Guy Pearce steals the film as the vile special agent who uses ruthless tactics to force the law. It demonstrates a corrupt society and the link of one enduring family. Score: 7 / 10",Lawless

Forrest's boisterous defiance and Cricket's knack for moonshine production help the brothers gain a local monopoly. When Forrest is wounded as tension with Rakes escalates, Jack, initially the timid one, must prove his worth against gangster Floyd Banner's mob.We see him change into an exhibitionist with his attempts to woo the preacher's daughter, Bertha.It's the same with these sort of movies. We get supporting roles from two very good actors, one of them in a very different role than what we have seen them before, and we have one of the leads coming off a huge hit from a summer blockbuster.and for the most part, the film is utter bilge.Lawless is no exception to the rule, and despite, the brilliant Oldman (who is in it for about five minutes) and Hardy, the film is a maundering character piece of uninteresting people, and is ruined by personality vacuum dire labeouf.His transformation into whiny little meek boy, into whiny little psychopath is laughable and unrealistic.As said before, Hardy is good, but is invincible, after throat injuries and being shot, he still lives to fight another day.And then there is Pearce. Anyone who can ignore the fact he has no eyebrows and concentrate on the narration is a better person than me, he ticks all the boxes on the sneery villain page, and it grates.I lowered my expectation, and was expecting something average, with a few exciting scenes, and rich narrative.I wasn't expecting an uneven movie, glorifying crooks (the books written by a family member), ignoring any female characters, and including violence for violence sakes.Hardy and Oldman are fantastic as usual, but the rest of the cast really bring them down (i'm not including Chastain, because as i've already said, female characters are there for nothing else but distraction).Very poor.",Lawless

A crooked law enforcement agent (Guy Pearce) tries to muscle in on the bootlegging activities in a Virginia hill town but some residents are not willing to let him take over. The war the follows is both thrilling and believable. It's also very scary because the movie makes you care about the characters - something that not many movies like this can achieve.First a warning - the violence is memorable and shocking. So it's not for younger audiences. It may be a bit excessive for some adults too.The acting and casting is perfect. Who knew an Englishman Tom Hardy could play a West Viriginian in such a convincing way. He even has a hillbilly figure to boot. Shia is just right as the headstrong and naive and his accent isn't too bad either. The chameleon like Jessica Chastain can act beautiful and her strength is just moving. It was a bit unnecessary for her to display nudity for the role though. Mia is quite good and has an Amish kind of look so it's quite perfect. Guy Pearce sans eyebrows shows his versatility as a menacing villain.Overall this is a well acted and slightly over violent action drama with a good story.",Lawless

The rest of the cast is strong given the weak script and the overall atmosphere of the Depression era bootlegging business is brought sharply into focus by director John Hillcoat with the aid of a fine musical score by Nick Cave.

29,zetes,Very entertaining,8,9 September 2012,"Very good. It's not deep or anything, but it's entertaining and delightfully violent. Three bootlegging brothers, played by Shia LaBeouf, Tom Hardy and Jason Clarke, work in rural Virginia in a county that isn't too keen on Prohibition. The law there doesn't bother enforcing Prohibition, and are even customers themselves. The real trouble comes when the Bondurant Brothers take their wares to the big city, which attracts federal law in the form of a special deputy from Chicago (Guy Pearce). Pearce is a nasty individual, and he brings a great violence to the county. LeBeouf's character is the only one who gets a lot of development, and I think the writing behind that character is good and LeBeouf handles it pretty well (personally, I think the hatred of LeBeouf comes solely from his unlikeable behavior in real life; on the screen, he is far from talentless). The other characters are pretty two-dimensional (and the two female leads, Mia Wasikowska and Jessica Chastain, can barely even be called that), but that doesn't mean the actors don't give interesting two-dimensional performances. Hardy's grunting I loved, and Pearce, well, Pearce is the kind of scenery-chewing villain that I just love. Now that the Academy recognizes hairstyling in its make-up category, the people behind this guy's hairstyle ought to be up for an Oscar. My only big complaint, and it's a huge one, is that the movie was shot on digital cameras, and it looks ugly. Not as ugly as Michael Mann's awful Public Enemies, but still ugly and it kind of takes you out of the period. John Hillcoat used digital photography better in The Proposition. He should have used film here, though I suppose it would have been much more expensive.",Lawless

31,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Lawless,6,18 November 2012,"In competition at this year's Cannes Film Festival, Lawless is a tale set against the 20s Prohibition era in the United States, telling the historical tale about the three Bondurant Brothers running their moonshine business, and seemingly, against all odds, came through a period of corruption, lawlessness, and just about having to watch over their shoulders almost all of the time while they eke out a living. Based on the book The Wettest County in the World written by one of their descendants Matt Bondurant, the film boasts a stellar A-list cast but didn't seem to lift the film under the direction of Australian director John Hillcoat.Instead I was more enamored by the many of the era's motor vehicles instead, which were featured in some detail, and making their appearances as a tool for transporting the brothers' illegal liquor, or to be used as a babe magnet on dates. And with most gangster films, shoot em ups are part and parcel, which Hillcoat shot with aplomb, especially when riddling the sheet metal with holes and shattering many of the cars' windows. Violence is part and parcel expected during the time amongst those who live their lives breaking the law, and Lawless does have its fair share of unflinching, violent set pieces that range from getting one's throat slit from ear to ear, to bloody castrations. It's survival of the fittest and the ruthless, especially when needing to exert influence and convince the naysayers.Which, instead of something being done by the bad guys, turn out to be something adopted by the law instead. Special agent Charlie Rakes (Guy Pearce) turns up seemingly being tasked to sweep Franklin County, Virginia, from its vice like grip on moonshining, being the infamous moonshine capital of the country, only to find that he's in it for some kickbacks, which if not agreed upon by the bootleggers, this will spell trouble. So for the Bondurant brothers Forrest (Tom Hardy), Howard (Jason Clarke) and Jack (Shia LaBeouf), this meant being under Charlie's radar and being systematically dealt with to varying degrees of impact, sometimes Charlie having to rely on a proxy to do his dirty work.We all know how tough Tom Hardy can be, but this role somewhat projected a more muted involvement from the strongman, being the leader of the brothers' operations, but having to contend with a romantic subplot with Chicago fleeing dancer turned waitress Maggie (Jessica Chastain) instead. Jason Clarke as second brother seemed to be the extra amongst the trio, while Gary Oldman made a cameo in a gangster role, appearing in a handful of scenes just to up the star ensemble. Guy Pearce on the other hand, really made his Charlie Rakes role his own, the cop who uses any extreme methods to get the job done, although very little is said of the sociopathic character outside of his job scope.It's been some time since Shia LaBeouf made an appearance on the big screen (since the last Transfomers movie last year), since this one time rising star seemed to have had his wings clipped for slamming one of his earlier films. It's good to see him back not in a goofball role, but one that mirrored Michael Corleone's in The Godfather, having the baby of the family inevitably roped in to carry the family business with new perspectives and dare, and growing into the role that calls for pulling the trigger when required. In some ways Lawless also seemed to love centering around this character, charting his meteoric rise in their moonshine business, his courtship of a preacher's daughter (Mia Wasikowska) and his partnership with family friend Cricket (Dane DeHaan), who's their distillation expert.The narrative develops at a meditative pace, slowing life down and then putting focus on a few pertinent issues that happened in recorded accounts. You will begin to realize just why these three brothers were once thought to be invincible, given the ordeal they have to go through, in order to operate something for so long, under the noses and the long arm of the law. The film explodes only toward the end when all hell broke loose, and in the meantime to endure the film, you can feast your eyes on the beautiful technical aspects that make up costumes, production sets, and yes, the vehicles.",Lawless
32,siderite,Great cast in a slow atmosphere movie that says nothing,7,30 November 2012,"The script is Nick Cave's, the music is Nick Cave's, at least he didn't play in the film, although I think he would have been a great Rakes. The cast is stellar, with Guy Pierce managing a demented special deputy with style, Shia LeBeouf and Tom Hardy doing great and having cool others like Gary Oldman and Mia Wasikowska. Dane DeHaan didn't play a psychotic this time, although he was gimp and a little slow in the head.Now about the movie: it is based on a book written by a Bondurant about Bondurants, a clan of bootleggers during the prohibition era. Now, as an atmosphere piece and an era film this was not bad, showing the way local law was swaying with the strongest arm around, the hillbillies that would make hard liquor out of anything and the opportunistic mobsters that would take advantage of all of this. But the film missed something essential. It was impossible to empathise with the small boy grown in the shadows of his older and apparently indestructible brothers, or with the tough but mindless said brothers, with the cowardly police or neighbours or even with the dancer coming from Chicago to work in the country because she was tired and scared of the city.The only characters that were remotely interesting were Rakes, the preacher's daughter and the mobster played by Gary Oldman. Alas, only Pierce's character got sufficient screen time. Instead we were to feast our eyes to the slow and mind dumbing routine of remote living bootleggers and not even that much.So, bottom line, I came in with great expectations on this movie and that is why, I believe, I felt it was subpar. I am rating it average because of the actors that played very well. However I felt that the film was one of those examining the beauty of growing grass which I personally do not enjoy much.",Lawless

Sure, its not flawless, but a worthy watch nonetheless. 'Lawless' Synopsis: Set in Depression-era Franklin County, Virginia, a bootlegging gang is threatened by a new deputy and other authorities who want a cut of their profits.'Lawless' is disturbing & awfully gruesome. Its certainly not meant for the faint-hearted. But, it will definitely click with those who have a strong stomach. Nick Cave's Adapted Screenplay is no-holds-barred & furiously convincing. However, the film needed some trimming, by at least 20-minutes. John Hillcoat's Direction is stylish. Cinematography is grim. Editing could've been sharper. Art & Costume Design are historically accurate. Performance-Wise: Tom Hardy is a terrific actor & he delivers once again. Shia LaBeouf is serviceable. Jason Clarke is pretty good. Jessica Chastain is fantastic. Guy Pearce is the scene stealer here. Cast as the despicable villain, Pearce is loathsome at best! Gary Oldman lends grace in a cameo.

Particularly Pierce whose evil law enforcement really stimulates hate from the viewer to the point where you cheer when they finally take him out. When it is based on the real battle in the wettest county for moonshine in Kentucky during and after prohibition, you get some good stuff.All you really need here is a bit more telling of the real tale. While everyone is based on the real folks, the only one who really comes to life is Guy Pierce. Even though the viewer is cheering against him, it is not because the audience has been grabbed by Hardy.

36,lasttimeisaw,Lawless,8,19 July 2012,"A KVIFF screening of Australian director John Hillcoat's latest Prohibition period drama about bootleggers, I have watched his breakthrough western piece THE PROPOSITION (2005, a 7/10) but the DVD of his adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's unadaptable THE ROAD (2009) is still on my shelf (I do need a potent motivation to watch this one). This time, Hillcoat allies with his old pal Nick Cave (who is billed as the screenwriter and unsurprisingly co-writes the original music with Warren Ellis), and musters a pack of red-hot Hollywood names (from his third-time collaborator and fellow countryman Guy Pearce, to the Hollywood new talent Jessica, Mia, Tom and of course, Shia, until a career-revived Gary Oldman), the star power is dazzling and the film is carried out in a compelling way to some extent one would be carried away by the narrative and put the based-on-a-true-story tag out of mind (save for the moderately disappointing coda). It is an actor's battlefield, Tom Hardy and Shia LaBeouf are the leading men of the story, the brotherhood bondage (with Jason Clarke as the brother between) is mingled with bloody violence and sporadical laughters (thanks to Tom Hardy's bullish grunts and his unquenchable life-force, an amazingly effortless performance). Shia, on the other hand, is the one who experiences the catharsis in his maturation from boy to man through the bootleg business. Jessica Chastain, a rare strong female foil among the riots packed netherworld, steals the show using her hauntingly absorbing gravitation and Mia Wasikowska by and large sidelines with her more naturalistic presence. Guy Pearce's portrayal of the chief villain is quite disconcerting and horrendous, but compared with an impeccable exemplar from Javier Bardem's Oscar-garlanded role in NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN (2007, 9/10), his character falls superficial and lack of a bit deeper excavation.The film could have surged high if only the final shootout scene had been honed up onto a more stunning spectacle, but in fact, instead of manifesting the thin line between life and death which is founded on intrepidity of the character and adroitness of utilizing the pistols, it has been dwindled into a blunt gun-down game as if they are shooting a film-in-the-film set piece, which is pitifully unable to lift the film's suspended tension.",Lawless
37,KineticSeoul,Had potential to be a better gang movie,6,25 October 2012,"This is one of those movies with enough development in the script and the characters it would have been something. It isn't a bad movie but it had potential to be even better. The movie just seemed to lack some depth in some areas, it had a decent direction though. And it was engaging to see the three brothers who are bootleggers during the prohibition work together. But this is Shia LaBeouf's movie since he is the main protagonist and in this he is the youngest of the Bondurant brothers. Basically he is the one that really wants to get in on the action of bootlegging while trying to win the heart of a preacher's daugther. And Shia is actually pretty darn good in this role, and fit in perfectly for this story. Tom Hardy is the toughest, intimidating and silent of the brothers and has this tendency to make these groaning noises most of the way through. But it works for his character and you can believe why he is the leader of the operation. He is sorta like Boris ""the bullet dodger"" in this. Gary Oldman is in this but the only scene that stands out with him in it is when he is shooting his Tommy gun which is unfortunate. Because it would have been nice to get a bit more out of his character of being a notorious gangster during the bootlegging era. Guy Pearce is the main villain and he plays his role in a very dis-likable manner which means he is doing his job well. A bit comical but it works for the movie as a whole. And you get a nude scene with Jessica Chastain which would have equaled a definite must see. But the movie as a whole is a bit too straightforward. If it was at least a bit more character driven drama without it feeling like the movie is dragging it might have been a better movie. Since it would have lead to caring more about the Bondurant brothers. It showed what the Bodurant brothers did without much emotion but since the story flowed alright I give it a 6.8/10.6.8/10",Lawless
38,Hellmant,Two of my favorite actors right now (Tom Hardy and Shia LaBeouf) team up!,9,31 August 2012,"'LAWLESS': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five) Two of my favorite actors right now (Tom Hardy and Shia LaBeouf) team up for this Depression-era bootlegging gangster movie based on the 2008 novel 'The Wettest County in the World' by Matt Bondurant. The novel tells the true story of three bootlegging brothers (Matt's grandfather and two great-uncles) fighting to keep their bootlegging business out of the hands of corrupt authorities in Franklin County, Virginia during the prohibition. Hardy and LeBeouf play two of the brothers and Jason Clarke plays the other. The film also co-stars Guy Pearce, Jessica Chastain, Mia Wasikowska, Gary Oldman and Dane DeHaan (following his hit from earlier this year 'CHRONICLE'). It was directed by John Hillcoat (director of 'THE ROAD' and 'THE PROPOSITION', which also starred Guy Pearce) and written by Hillcoat's usual partner in crime Nick Cave. I found the film interesting and very intense at times, highlighted by great performances (especially Hardy and LaBeouf).The Bondurant brothers were legendary in Franklin County, some thought they were invincible, as Frank (Hardy) and Howard (Clarke) had survived multiple near death experiences. Jack (LaBeouf) was the younger and less experienced brother who was put to his first test when crooked Special Deputy Charles Rakes (Pearce) came to town, looking for a cut of the brothers' profits, and Frank (not willing to give in) was severely wounded (but of course survived, furthering his legendary status). Jack scores a big deal with the local mob boss, Floyd Banner (Oldman), and learns to grow in to the lifestyle because of it. At the same time he tries to court a preacher's daughter (Wasikowska) while Frank finds love of his own as well (Chastain). The brothers face much more violence though as Rakes becomes more desperate and ruthless.Hillcoat's directing is rough as well as beautiful once again and Cave's script is interesting and involving. It's the performances that really make the movie work though as every major actor in the film adds something memorable and different to it. Of course Hardy and LeBeouf are the two reasons I most loved the film though. I've been a fan of LaBeouf's since 'HOLES' in 2003 (he totally made that film for me) and have even enjoyed his bigger Hollywood films (like the 'TRANSFORMERS' movies and 'DISTURBIA') before he swore them off recently (he's hilarious in those films, despite how cheesy they might be). I'm also a big fan of his rebellious 'honest to a fault' attitude; that's how I try to live my life and admire him for setting that kind of an example for his fans. He kills it once again in this film with an emotionally charged and relatable performance. Hardy I'm a new fan to but he's probably the most on his game of any actor right now; he never ceases to impress and in this film he's no different. He plays a quiet, shy brute that always carries an intimidating badass presence despite his shyness (he speaks mostly just in grunts). I've heard him called 'his generation's Brando' but I think he's even better. I look forward to more and more films lucky enough to earn his talent (especially the upcoming 'MAD MAX: FURY ROAD', in which he plays the iconic Mel Gibson character). Those two performances did make the movie for me but everyone involved brought their A game as well, which amounted to a pretty satisfying movie going experience.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7YhqgcaX3Q",Lawless
39,thesar-2,Lifeless,3,25 March 2014,"The trailer makes Lawless look like the most thought-provoking, action-packed western/gangster/prohibition of all time.From what I can rememberNo. I was simply bored and didn't believe most of this supposedly ""true story.""A friend at work – who no longer works with me, huh – not only recommended it to me, but demanded I bring her DVD home and watch it before she left the company. I did, for several reasons.One: I do like the actors in the film, including Tom Hardy, Shia ""pre-crazy"" LaBeouf and Guy Pearce. Two: I've heard others praise it like this coworker did. And, again, the trailer made it lookexciting.Eventually, I found the true reasoning on why this ex-coworker loved it: She had a crush on Tom Hardy. Not that there's anything wrong with that, asdo I, but, it's not enough for me to spend almost two hours with an okay story with extremely little surprising twists.Unfortunately, it's been a bit of time since I've seen this – two months or so, and not much has stuck with me, other than how bored I was through most of this. And how I doubted most of what happened. For example: this supposedly took place about a hundred years ago and a character is sliced across the throat. Not only does his live, but without proper care for hours after his incident.Normally I provide a synopsis, but I've long since forgotten this mostly joyless experience. Suffice to say, brothers-in-booze have a clichéd business man to deal with if they want to continue with their anti-prohibition ways. Throw in some spicy heroines and some mumbled speeches/loyalties and there's the rest.Not that it's the most unoriginal film, but it's certainly not the most memorable one. It's recommended for that tight circle that cares about that old era in America history.* * * Final thoughts: Fine. I agree with my friend. Tom Hardy. What a man. Also, Shia. So these two should be enough reason to bring me to see this multiple times in the theatre. If the internet didn't exist and it was 1985.",Lawless
40,Robert_duder,Fell short of some hefty expectations,7,25 November 2012,"I missed Lawless in the theatres and everyone who had seen it absolutely raved about it. I even heard people say ""their favourite movie"" so by the time I got to see it on DVD I expected a lot from it. Lawless was okay but that is pretty much where it ends...it was just okay. It is essentially a western set in the 1940's so it has some gangster feel to it but yet it seems to float around genres and never seems to really find its footing. A couple of other IMDb reviewers nailed it on the head when they said you never really connect to any one of the characters, and they tend to be a little bit two dimensional. It has a great cast, no one can deny that, and the trailers certainly make it look like a non-stop action gorefest and it has some action and some gore and some sex but nothing ever really stands out to me. Still it was entertaining and certainly well filmed, the cinematography for the time period was extremely well done. In certain situations you will feel like you are right there with them. There are too many characters, not one main character and no truly strong character development so that holds the film back.My one reason for being wary of watching this was Shia LaBeouf. I'm not a fan of his, I think he overacts and never really becomes one with his part. So imagine my shock when he wasn't the issue at all. In fact he was tolerable and very nearly the best character. He puts aside his usual ego to play a good character. I'm not even sure Tom Hardy was awake for this film. Despite playing a pinnacle character that goes through a lot, he looks bored and grunts his way through his lines and is really disappointing. I know he's better than this. Guy Pearce plays a decent villain though I think he overplays it quite a bit in this particularly film. Jessica Chastain who seems to be in everything anymore, is okay. She is herself. She doesn't seem to have a lot of range and this is a very typical character for her. Mia Wasikowska gets about the same level of performance as Chastain does. She's a romantic lead for LaBeouf and does okay at looking doe eyed and nothing else. Dane DeHaan might be the saving performance in the film. He is actually really good as Cricket and is probably the only character you'll feel anything for whatsoever. Gary Oldman (who I really like) shows up in a small role that is barely a blip on the radar.Sometimes I think I've watched so many movies I can predict the work experience of the director or writers. It shouldn't surprise anyone that director John Hillcoat comes from music documentaries. Lawless often feels chaotic and without direction. The story is somewhat weak and doesn't really require two hours to tell. Top moonshiners get a hard time from the new law in town and opposing moonshiners...half hour and wrap. The film was okay and its worth seeing for the most part but I had such high expectations of it really being outstanding and it was simply just okay. 7/10",Lawless
41,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"Quite impressive, atmospheric prohibition era thriller",7,3 April 2013,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningIn the early 1930s, in the south of America, prohibition is in full swing, something outlaw Forrest Bondurant (Tom Hardy) uses to his advantage, until he gets too cocky one night and pays the price. The burden then falls on younger brother Jack (Shia LaBeouf) to continue the family way, but he has much to prove of himself as a man, pushed around by corrupt Deputy Sheriff Charlie Rakes (Guy Pearce) and having to compete against top gangster Floyd Banner (Gary Oldman.) As he gradually earns his dues, it all builds up to a shattering confrontation at the end where only one will come out on top.Over twenty five years since it came out, Brian De Palma's The Untouchables remains probably the greatest indictment of a period in history during the early thirties in America (that I've seen, anyway) called the prohibition, that was also a thrilling, genuinely superb all round effort. I can't think of many other films that followed this setting, but Lawless, an effort from director John Hillcoat, whose most high profile effort before that I can see was The Road with Viggo Mortensen, while not even close to that film's quality, is still a commendable effort that is certainly well made enough to stand out.Hillcoat transfers the illegal liquer action from the high rising, wind swept streets of Chicago to the more rural south and crafts a film that gets by on a lingering sense of atmosphere and tension, not on any sense of over wrought sentiment or melodrama. He has at hand a selection of young, and still fairly young, performers in key roles who pretty much give their all, certainly that could be expected of them. While the story is driven by themes of loyalty and honour, to be honest it lacks a really stable core and doesn't feel guided as much by having a real beginning, middle and end. While this doesn't detract from the overall impact of the story themetically, you do feel yourself sometimes losing the thrust of it and getting lost.Still, it's an undeniably impacting effort that, well, leaves it's mark on you. ***",Lawless
42,MOscarbradley,Lesser Hillcoat is still a cut above the rest.,7,18 August 2018,"John Hillcoat may not be the most prolific of directors, (just 6 feature films in 30 years), but with a John Hillcoat film you know precisely what you are going to get; gritty, extremely violent, male-orientated entertainments that, more likely or not, will be visually stunning and probably with a screenplay by Nick Cave. ""Lawless"" is archetypal Hillcoat. Apparently based on a true story it's set in Depression-era Virginia and is about a trio of bootlegger brothers , (Tom Hardy, Shia LeBeouf and Jason Clarke), who are targeted by a corrupt Deputy Sheriff, (Guy Pearce), and again Nick Cave wrote the screenplay and again it is almost sickeningly violent which means it's not going to appeal to everyone.Despite the talent involved, (and that includes cinematographer Benoit Delhomme and composers Cave and Warren Ellis), this is one of Hillcoat's lesser films. There are too many characters and too many star names, (Gary Oldman, Jessica Chastain and Mia Waiskowska are also involved), and too meandering a plot but even lesser Hillcoat is a cut above most of what passes for multiplex entertainment these days. Surprisingly, Hillcoat has remained more of a cult director than someone commanding the mainstream and maybe that's for the best. He may not be the most prolific of directors and his films may not bag loads of money but at least he has kept his cinematic dignity.",Lawless

If you're a fan of gangster films or films with tons of violence, this is a good film to watch. It's an interesting piece because just like all Prohibition-era material, this history is worth learning about. I believe this film does a good job conveying the history and it does it's job rightly. This film made me want to research this interesting history.John Hillcoat, who is back in the director's chair after his very good 2009's The Road, directs a film that tells the tale of the Bondurant brothers. This film is the story about how these three brothers sold moonshine during Prohibition and their daily interactions with law officials and mobsters.If there is one thing that is great about this film, it's the acting. This film is incredibly acted and adds power to the story. I am not a huge fan of Shia LaBeouf, but he does have emotional depth in him after all. Tom Hardy has his best role to date and that's even after powerful turns in both Warrior and the Dark Knight Rises. Jason Clarke is intimidating and very good in his role. The female characters played by Jessica Chastain and Mia Wasikowska are very good. As a big Gary Oldman fan, I just wish he had more screen-time in this film.Overall, Lawless is one masterful film. It knows how to properly tell a story thanks to a well-adapted screenplay. The themes of brotherhood and their life-strengthening bonds are prevalent throughout the film and I love how the film explores these relationships.

46,secondtake,"Great scenes, great idea, but weirdly mediocre",7,8 September 2012,"Lawless (2012)There's violence and there's violence. In a Tarantino movie, the violence and blood are so plastic and so stylistically over the top, you can accept it when it happens even if you have to look the other way. In ""Lawless"" directed by John Hillcoat, the violence and blood are shocking and disturbing. And needlessly.Because another difference between, say, ""Inglourious Basterds"" and ""Lawless"" is the simple fact that ""Lawless"" is based on fact. This is real life blood and guts. Not that it's a documentary, but it's not, by any stretch, a fantasy, a fiction, a movie entertainment.I start with this aspect not because it's so much bloodier than other movies, but because it has so little else to distinguish it. Don't get me wrong--it's a well filmed, high budget movie with a terrific sense of 1920s rural Virginia. It will sweep many viewers right in, and gladly. It also has something of an appealing plot, at least as far as the summary--bootleggers outsmarting and out stabbing the law and creating some terrific moonshine in them hills. In fact, I liked this idea so much I was sorely disappointed that there wasn't just a bit more of how it was done, the actual stills and operation, and the taste and proof of the product. (It's all hinted at, for sure.)But what this movie could have been about is what it started out being--a look at a rough and tumble family at the middle of the violence, the Bondurants, ancestors of the writer Matt Bondurant. Here are three brothers who have some interesting sibling relationships that are oversimplified but which start to give the movie some depth. But after awhile you'll realize it's not going to be a study of a crazy family, either. Nor is it about a cat and mouse game between the law and the lawless, though that gets started now and then, too. It's not about all that much besides the somewhat predictable escalation of tension between the authorities and the Bondurants.Maybe most disturbing and senseless of all is the cut and paste insertion of the two female characters. First there's the cliché of the cute and sweet preacher's daughter (Mia Wasikowska) who is meant, I think, to make the youngest brother have a sweet human side to him (which he does). Then there's the highly decorative, highly overdressed city girl (Jessica Chastain) who drops in like a character from The Great Gatsby and asks for a job at this hell hole tavern where, naturally, she both gets in serious trouble and gets involved with one of the brothers. The whole thing is a beautiful mess. The acting is often excellent, especially Tom Hardy as the grunting older brother. There are excellent moments, some excellent visual stuff inside and out. Yes, there is a feeling of potential. But after two hours of potential I was frustrated and bored. And the ending? What a farce! It's so cute and feel-good it makes you wonder if the first hour and fifty minutes was for real.If you just want a reasonably convincing mise-en-scene, you might really love this movie. But if you want anything more--anything at all--you'll have to dig into the cracks and pull out the crumbs.",Lawless

51,tomgillespie2002,2012 the perfect time to reflect on 20th century depression,6,18 November 2012,"Prohibition-era America is incredibly rich in narrative and mythology. Behind the realities of the great economic depression the underbelly of society rise in criminal organisation, creating the underworld of bootleg alcohol and the clandestine drinking establishments known as speakeasies. With this specific historical backdrop, American cinema has created a glamorised iconography of the 1930's, the idolised gangsters and almost politically justified violence. Lawless only briefly flirts with the glamour of this period, but believes in the self-appointed mythology of it's characters. John Hillcoat and Nick Cave's film embeds itself within the roots, straight to the source of the big city's modern attractions. We're not in Al Capone's Chicago, but deep in the heart of the American wilderness, Franklin County, Virginia.The three Bondurant brothers, Howard (Jason Clarke), Forest (Tom Hardy), and Jack (Shia LeBeouf), run a moonshine operation in the sparsely populated backwater town, and despite the national prohibition laws, local authorities participate in alcohol consumption. But even within the moral vacuum of Virginia, the modern corruption and perversity's of the city will inevitably invade. Guy Pearce's sinister and narcissistic ""lawman"", Charlie Rakes, infects the rustic landscape with his false malevolence. Pearce shaves his eyebrows off for the role, bringing a visual nod towards the characters vanity. His appearance is impeccable, and an odour of perfume is alluded to on occasion, a veneer that hides a deeply sadistic human, a character who also flaunts his wealth within poverty perhaps a signifier of our current perception of the suited banker.In American Gothic traditions, surrounding the three brothers is a legend perpetuated within the small community, a superstition created out of perceived supernatural beginnings. After the two older brothers escape death in situations where others perished, a myth is attached to them suggesting that the Bondurants are invincible, a narrative that opens a niche in the community where they are impervious to the nations laws. Tom Hardy's middle child is the centre of this family unit, and his hulking presence tersely guides them, where as the elder, Howard, is the fearless bulldog, throwing himself at anything in their way. Forest's violence is calculated, he seems too bulky and clumsy in his laconic mannerisms, but, as in a scene in their bar, a densely packed burst of violence culminates in some horrifically graphic images. Believing your own myth is central to Lawless. Because of this belief, their confidence knows no boundaries. Even the audience is given the evidence to believe, when Forest survives having his throat hacked open.Whilst the older brothers battle to keep equilibrium, attempting to block the outside, modern world from intruding upon their traditions and redneck hokum, Lawless is fundamentally about the younger Jack, and LeBeouf gives his best performance to date. His character is set up perfectly when witnessing Floyd Banner (Gary Oldman) crashing through the small community, tommygun rattling at the car of his pursuers, the idealised image of gangster chic. Jack idolises these city criminals like teenagers idolise idiot pseudo-celebrity today, highlighting his naivete as he looks into this world from the outside. What comes with Jacks hero-worship is an unwavering ambition to take the bootlegging business further. LeBeouf balances Jack's progression with great intensity, managing the conflicting mix of gullibility and confrontational confidence. Whilst not a perfect performance, I saw a bit of Tom Hanks in LeBeouf.Like Hillcoat's previous films The Proposition (2005) and The Road (2008), Lawless evokes the visual textures of the landscape. The first in the Australian outback, secondly in a post-apocalyptic world, working again with cinematographer Benoit Delhomme (who collaborated previously on The Proposition), the environment permeates the screen, the dust kicked up from informally created roads, scattered over the wooden, man- made structures, the grit and grime forming with the sticky blood as Jack is violently beaten to the ground by Rakes. The untouched landscape can be both beautiful and malevolent.A film about corruption, and particularly the long hand that breaks from the city limits to corrupt further afield. 2012 is possibly the perfect time to reflect upon this 21st century depression, and remember not to worship false idols. Nick Cave based his terse screenplay on a novel by Matt Bondurant (grandson of Jack), and obviously is based upon a true story. Whether much has been passed down through the family with ambiguities, the Chinese whisper of myth making is unknown, but the Bondurant brothers seem mythical. Their involvement in a national epidemic, the superstition of death-dodging all add to their own sense of power and the towns fear of them. Are they supernatural heroes of the American psyche? Or, do the older brothers reflect the defeated world of the Wall Street crash, whilst the younger reaches out to the celebrity world of high-class gangster, looking to a future of wealth? It's an interesting inclusion into the reflective nature of cyclical history. As we continue through our own economic crisis, we look back to the past to compare, and check on our evolution.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",Lawless
52,Thanos_Alfie,I expected more...,6,16 January 2021,"""Lawless"" is a Crime - Drama movie in which we watch three brothers running their distillery and bootlegging business without anyone making any trouble. This will change when a new special deputy comes in town and he along with some other want a cut of their profits.I have to admit that I had high expectations from this movie due to its cast, its plot and its trailer, but in the end I was a bit disappointed. The interpretations of Jason Clarke who played as Howard Bondurant, Guy Pearce who played as Charley Rakes and Tom Hardy who played as Forrest Bondurant were good but Jessica Chastain who played as Maggie Beaufort and Shia LaBeouf who played as Jack Bondurant did not reach their potential. The direction which was made by John Hillcoat was average and I believe that he did not succeed on making us neither feel nor understand the struggle or pain of his main characters. Lastly, I am not saying that ""Lawless"" is a bad movie, I was just expecting more than an ordinary - average crime movie with some suspense.",Lawless
53,Floated2,Great acting and violence elevates Lawless a few notches,7,21 October 2013,"Lawless is based on a story novel titled ""The Wettest County in the World"", this film tells the true story of the Bondurant brothers, who ran a bootlegging business in the Virginia backwoods. Director Hillcoat shoots the film as a brutal neo-Western. The time frame of Lawless is 1931, and as the Bondurant brothers build their moonshine business, youngest brother Jack (LaBeouf) wants to be more involved. Big brother Forrest (Hardy) would rather keep him out of it, while Howard (Clarke) just goes with the flow. As Jack secretly teams up with mechanical whiz Cricket (DeHaan) to ramp up production, the slimy city-slicker Agent Rakes (Pearce) arrives to hunt down bootleggers in the area. Soon the brothers are running a delicate balance, dodging Rakes and his goons while they keep mobster Banner (Oldman) supplied with hooch.Undercutting this increasingly nasty male-dominated story are two women: Maggie (Chastain) is a barmaid with a shady past who finds herself drawn to the monosyllabic Forrest, while Bertha (Wasikowska) is the local preacher's daughter who rebels by encouraging Jack's crush. Both of these side-plots develop with real delicacy, even as they intersect with the film's most horrific moments. Quite a few scenes are so fiercely violent that they're hard to watch.The plot's layers keep us gripped to a tale in which the police are snarling villains and the criminals are likable and loyal. LaBeouf is gripping and controllable as a the lead where we see the development he has made throughout the film. Hardy is magnetic as a man who is hard as nails on the surface, but has a deeply hidden vein of compassion and mischief. Chastain has some extremely powerful moments of her own, while Oldman is also particularly good in a small role that bristles with energy. And Pearce gets to chomp merrily on the scenery (and wear the film's most ridiculous costumes and hair). Lawless may turn some heads away for its slow pacing, but within each scene, another brutal violence patch usually follows up leaving the audience in awe.",Lawless
54,l_rawjalaurence,Violent Depiction of the Prohibition Era,6,21 April 2014,"Set during the Prohibition Era in 1931, LAWLESS traces the fortunes of the three Bondicant brothers - Forrest (Tom Hardy), the brains, Howard (Jason Clarke), the heavy, and Jack (Shia LaBoeuf), the weakest of the trio, as they run their bootlegging business in a rural part of Franklin County, West Virginia. Theirs is a risky business; not only do they have to worry about rival syndicates, notably that led by Floyd Banner (Gary Oldman), but they are continually harassed by an over-zealous deputy Charlie Rakes (Guy Pearce), who is determined to eradicate them at all costs. John Hillcoat's film explores the tempestuous relationship between the brothers; although perpetually denigrating Jack as the ""runt"" of the family, the other two always stand up for him, especially when he gets into trouble. Likewise Jack does his best to maintain the bootlegging business, even if it means making an audacious trip to sell illicit hooch to Flord Banner, accompanied by the disabled Cricket Pate (Dane DeHaan). The film establishes a convincing sense of period, a time when bootleggers either killed or were killed as they strove to maintain their supremacy in an overcrowded market. Dismissed as ""hicks,"" because of their rural origins, the Bondicants turn out to be formidable adversaries, even though Forrest tends to believe a little too much in his (self-constructed) legend about the family's indestructibility. The film is extremely violent, containing at least two stomach-churning sequences, but this is necessary to the depiction of a dog-eat-dog world in which everyone is out for themselves. The only jarring note in an otherwise tautly plotted thriller is Guy Pearce's pantomime villain: with his immaculate suits and perpetually curled lip, he seems to have wandered in from a Victorian melodrama rather than an early Thirties gangster movie. We feel that his demise at the end is richly deserved, as Jack finally overcomes his squeamishness about shooting enemies and mortally wounds the deputy. Howard completes the coup de grace by stabbing Rakes in the back.",Lawless
55,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"""Lawless"" wins as a Western",7,19 September 2012,"Seriously, prohibition did no one any favors. ""Lawless"" is a Western-inspired take on the gangster pic, in which the only rules are that there are no rules and the men with the power are the men who wield the most fear — and guns.Combined with his previous films ""The Proposition"" and ""The Road,"" Australian director John Hillcoat has become the foremost director of contemporary Westerns, even if only ""The Proposition"" can technically be considered as such. Running through each of his films thematically is the notion of man doing what he must, namely putting the bonds of family ahead of all else.The Bondurant brothers, Howard (Jason Clarke), Forrest (Tom Hardy) and Jack (Shia LaBeouf), run a successful moonshine operation in Franklin, Va. during Prohibition, but when some feds, namely deputy Charlie Rakes (Guy Pearce), move in from Chicago, they shake things up in attempt to put a stranglehold on ""The Wettest County in the World."" Rakes' lack of hesitancy when it comes to using violence to assert his will pushes the brothers to the edge, and the film builds toward an inevitable standoff.""Lawless"" serves mostly as an exercise in the escalation of violent tactics in a place without law and order. Other than being slimy, obsessive-compulsive and all manners of dislikable, Pearce's Rakes doesn't appear to have much reason behind his methods other than he thinks he can get away with it. The Bondurants' refusal to give in to anyone else taking a cut of the profits is all it takes for things to get ugly — and fast.The film has an eye-opening physicality emphasized by Hillcoat's skill at depicting brute force and bare-knuckle violence. The way Rakes among others behaves will get quickly under your skin and have you rooting for full-force retaliation. This raw treatment calls upon our instincts and emotions like a Western does as opposed to the more mental approach, or aiming to appeal to the intellect while exploring corruption and power dynamics, per se. Consequently, ""Lawless"" ends up more thrilling and satisfying than complex and stimulating.The story zooms in on the youngest, Jack. It's a more dramatic turn for LaBeouf to be sure, but not exactly out of character. He's still the cocky-but-naive type, obsessed with the glamor of his trade but lacking the stones to defend himself or more importantly, hold his own amidst the corruption. You'll be drawn to his innocence, but despise him for his frailty.It's Hardy who wins top acting honors in this one as Forrest, the soft-spoken yet most dangerous and brazen of the three. If you had any doubts about Hardy's versatility or skill in more dramatic fair, this will put them to rest. He's the real deal. The script also provides him some vulnerable moments that deepen his character. Forrest might be stubborn, but he knows what it takes to survive in this jungle of sorts, and the subtlety of Hardy's delivery makes him all the more formidable on screen.If Pearce's character weren't so needlessly despicable, he might challenge Hardy more seriously for the film's best performance, but regardless, he disappears into the role and its his menace that drives it by fueling the characters' fire and consequently ours as well.The ladies of ""Lawless"" — Jessica Chastain and Mia Wasikowska — are wedged in, though they provide a nice balance to an otherwise unapologetically gritty film. We learn little about either woman: Chastain's Maggie came from a not-so-glamorous job in Chicago and sought out the Bondurants for work, while Wasikowska's Bertha is the preacher's daughter whose sole purpose in the script is to ultimately get Jack in trouble. ""Lawless"" would've been a great film if the time were taken to weave them more into the film's fabric as opposed to a distraction from the blood and moonshine. Gary Oldman's intriguing mobster character Floyd Banner has a similar fate.Choosing to view ""Lawless"" through the lens of a Western set in the South will make a world of difference. As a period drama, it's generic at best, not really adding anything to the conversation on Prohibition. Seeing it as a Western helps justify the general themes and wild, seat-of-the-pants attitude toward action and character motivation. Either way, it's a striking and gripping piece of genre filmmaking.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com",Lawless

57,BeneCumb,Rather pleasant 20th-century western,8,25 December 2012,"The movie centers on the brothers Jack, Forrest and Howard Bondurant, who sold moonshine in Franklin County (Virginia) during Prohibition in the United States; thus, a true story and the script is based on Matt Bondurant's (Jack's grandson) novel The Wettest County in the World, providing the movie an additional value. I am sure many events were changed and exaggerated, but the background and events seem realistic - based on my knowledge obtained from similar movies or books.The cast is great as well, with the most stylish and distinctive performances made by Shia LaBeouf, Guy Pearce and Gary Oldman. Female characters tend to be more sketchy and spend limited time on screen. Of course, moonshine manufacturing and business was no female occupation either.Well, there are several clichés and predictable scenes, meaning that Lawless is not entirely flawless (do not expect the level of Godfathers), but is still worth watching.",Lawless

Will this end well for the three brothers? I liked the setting, Tom Hardy is good in his performance. Shia Labeouf really surprised me here on how good his performance was, usually in all his films, it is like he is playing the same character, but not here. Guy Pearce was scary here in his role, every time he was on screen, you shook in terror, that is how good on an actor he is. Everybody does well here also.

59,PWNYCNY,Kudos for a wonderful movie.,10,14 September 2012,"This is an intense movie and it succeeds in grabbing and holding the audience's attention. Now, the movie claims to be based on true events, but so what? Whether the story is fabricated or not, it's a great movie. The actors perform with an intensity that is worthy of recognition. Tom Hardy is absolutely brilliant as the head of the clan that refused to knuckle under to corruption. And Shia La Boeuf gives a performance that is a surprising departure from his usual roles and does a great job. The story itself is fast paced, never loses it continuity, and succeeds in keeping the audience's attention throughout. But the biggest star in this movie is Guy Pearce. His performance dominates the movie. Also, his resemblance to Dan Duryea is uncanny, not only in appearance but in acting style, which is saying a lot because Dan Duryea was a great actor. Of course, special mention must be made for the lovely leading ladies in this movie, Jessica Chastain and Mia Wasikowska, who are as talented as they are beautiful.

61,estebangonzalez10,The immortal Forrest Bondurant,9,6 December 2012,"¨It is not the violence that sets men apart, alright, it is the distance that he is prepared to go.¨Lawless is a terrific action drama set in the depression era in a small Virginia town. The cinematography in this film is beautiful; I just love movies set in this period when they have a good story like this one. Lawless is based on the novel written by Matt Bondurant, ¨The Wettest County in the World,¨ the grandson of one of the characters in this film, and it claims to be based on a true story. The screenplay was adapted by Nick Cave, and the film directed by John Hillcoat (The Road). I was instantly won over by Lawless as soon as I saw the talented cast that was involved. Shia LaBeouf may have the lead role, but he is outshined by Tom Hardy who is the heart and soul of this movie. The rest of the cast was also excellent with Jessica Chastain, Mia Wasikowska, Dane DeHaan (the young Leonardo Di Caprio look alike from Chronicle), Gary Oldman, and Guy Pearce who plays the villain to perfection here. Gary Oldman is always great, but my only complaint here is that he gets as much screen time in the movie as he does in the trailer. He could've been used much more here, although I understand that there were a lot of different things going on. There was one terrific and brutal scene thirty minutes into the movie that really caught my attention and picked up the story from that point forward. It was the turning point for me. Hardy was the rock of this film and he absolutely nailed his role convincing the audience of the legends surrounding his character. I had some trouble with his grumpy voice at times understanding what he was saying, but his performance was spectacular nonetheless. In a way he reminded me of Ryan Gosling in Drive.The story takes place during the prohibition era in Franklin County, Virginia where the three Bondurant brothers, Forrest (Tom Hardy), Howard (Jason Clarke), and Jack (Shia LaBeouf) run a bootlegging business with the compliance of the local authorities. Jack's close friend, Cricket (Dane DeHaan), a young teenager who couldn't hurt a fly is responsible for the moonshine production for which he's very talented. At the same time, city girl Maggie (Jessica Chastain) shows up in the small town looking for a job at the local bar that Forrest runs. Trouble arises when a new Special Deputy arrives in town from Chicago. His name is Charlie Rakes (Guy Pearce), and he wants a bigger share in the Bondurant's profits. Rakes is eccentric and crooked, but he isn't intimidated by these brothers. The rest of the town believes in the legend that Forrest is immortal after having survived several life threatening experiences (even Forrest himself believes this). Forrest is perhaps the only one in the town that stands up against Rakes and defies him. The younger brother, Jack, initially is the most timid one, but after falling for the local preacher's daughter, Bertha (Mia Wasikowska) and scoring an important business deal with a famous mobster named Floyd Banner (Gary Oldman) he begins to transform himself into quite a respectable lad. The problem is that Rakes is keeping a close watch on their business and waiting for the perfect opportunity to intervene.Shia LaBeouf and Tom Hardy's characters are probably the best developed in the story. Shia goes through the greatest transformation, while Hardy remains the same always projecting this in control and cool persona. He truly believes he's immortal like the rest of the town. Jason Clarke is probably the least developed character along with Gary Oldman who really has very little screen time (a real shame). Guy Pearce is very cynical and twisted minded. He made for a perfect villain. Jessica Chastain and Mia Wasikowska both projected beauty and innocence in their roles. The cast was really great in this. I also loved the music and score that accompanied the film. The drama and action played out really well with a couple of violent and bloody scenes. There were several sub plots going on as well with the love interest between Jack and Bertha, and Forrest and Maggie. The legend behind these three men is probably what makes the film stand out story wise and puts Forrest on top of my favorite characters list for 2012. Lawless is a film you won't want to miss.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com",Lawless
62,jimbo-53-186511,"As a fan of the genre, this came as a huge disappointment",4,17 July 2013,"I absolutely love most gang/mob related films and some of my favourites include; The Untouchables, Goodfellas and Carlito's way. Unfortunately, Lawless stacks up as being one of the worst films of this genre that I've ever seen.We begin in the late 1920's during the Prohibition era with 3 brothers Jack Bondurant LaBeouf, Howard Bondurant - Clarke, and Forrest Bondurant - Hardy. The 3 brothers operate a 'Bootlegging Business' which involves distributing and selling alcohol. This is a practice which was illegal during this time. This proves to be lucrative for the brothers - the only thing they need to do is give the local sheriff a small backhander and he turns a blind eye to what they are doing. Things to start to go wrong for the brothers when the corrupt Mason Wardell - Tom Tolin and Special Deputy Charlie Rakes - Guy Pearce arrive from out of town and speak to Forrest - who acts as the head of the family and try to muscle in and force him to give them a substantial cut of the profit they make from their 'Bootlegging' otherwise they will make their lives hell. Forrest refuses to co-operate and says that 'they've never needed or asked for help from anyone before and that they weren't going to start now'. This antagonises Rakes and Wardell and thus sets up a feud between the 2 parties.Whilst all of the above sounds pretty exciting on paper work, the reality is that for a Gang/Mob film there just wasn't much in the way of conflict. There were perhaps 1 or 2 instances throughout the film, but for me this wasn't really enough to hold my interest. Another problem I felt was that too much time was spent on trying to develop La Beouf's characters love interest Bertha Minnix - Mia Wasikowska. This was not only uninteresting in itself, but her character was very poorly developed so I didn't find that I cared for her or their romance - they also had zero chemistry. The same could be said for Forrest's love interest - albeit to a slightly lesser extent. We see at the end that both brothers get married and live happily ever after, but we learn very little about their love interests throughout the film.There were a few things that I liked about Lawless. Firstly, I felt that LaBeouf's acting was excellent and he was much better than I thought he would be. I've never seen him really 'stretch his legs' as an actor, but the wide range of emotions he conveys in Lawless proves that he can act. Secondly was Guy Pearce's performance as the evil Deputy Rakes - he is pretty much unrecognisable in this role. His performance was chilling and menacing and I enjoyed every minute of screen time that he was afforded. Tom Hardy puts in an understated performance as Forrest - he is the cool and calm member of the family and he exudes 'coolness' in Lawless.Whilst I'm aware that this is supposed to be based on a 'true story' I couldn't help but wonder if a touch of 'poetic licence' has been used regarding what happened to Forrest's character. About halfway through the film, Forrest gets his throat cut and he apparently manages to walk to the hospital which I think was a 20 minute walk in order to get his neck treated and survives. Now I'm no expert on these sorts of things, but I would have thought that if you got a cut like that to the throat that you would be dead within a couple of minutes. Secondly, Forrest seems to get shot more times than 50 Cent and still manages to survive -slight exaggeration, but not by much. I haven't researched this so please don't quote me on it, but it just seemed unlikely to me. Maybe it did happen, or maybe the film makers have used this as a 'metaphor' to show that the Bondurant brothers were 'indestructible' which was mentioned a couple of times in the film.To summarise it best is to say that whilst it wasn't a totally awful film, it is certainly a weak film in comparison to many other films of the same genre. I felt that the film generally was very slow for the most part, many of the characters weren't properly fleshed out and with the exception of a couple of scenes and the last 10-15 minutes of the film was generally quite dull and boring.",Lawless
63,arthur_tafero,Better Than Average Depression Movie - Lawless,7,26 June 2019,"The reason people love films like Bonnie and Clyde and Hard Times is because it portrays people fighting back; fighting back against a society that has not given most of them a second thought. Modern movie-goers can identify with these characters because their governments (from wherever they are from) oven overlook millions of their own citizens who are fighting on a daily basis to make ends meet. This is why the characters in these films are appealing. I don't recollect anyone ever rooting for the police or the government in the theater I watched the film in; and I saw the film with a cop buddy of mine.
The film is a tad violent, but these were violent times. Based on the recollections of three bootleg brothers, it paints a fascinating picture of Virginia in 1931. Don't worry, this aint the Waltons.",Lawless
64,NateWatchesCoolMovies,Solid cast in a solid crime tale,8,8 April 2017,"John Hillcoat's Lawless is the very definition of badass. Bathed in blood and moonshine, gilded by Nick Cave's rustic, textured musical score and brought alive by vivid and varied performances from an eclectic, grizzled cast, it's one of the most enjoyable gangster pictures to come along in recent years. It follows the rough and tumble Bondurant brothers, fabled bootleggers who defy prohibition and run their product all over the aptly named 'wettest county in the world', until the greedy and very corrupt arm of the law snakes its way into the territory. The eldest and toughest is Forrest, a grumbly, shambling Tom Hardy who's something of a gentle giant, until the straight razor comes out and he's not. Jason Clarke is Howard the booze hound, who has sour mash coursing through his veins and a temper to prove it, and Shia Leboeuf, somewhat miscast, does his best as the youngest of the three. The three of them run an idyllic little manufacturing and distribution ring spiralling out of their county into the nearby area, until trouble comes looking for them, in the form of a monster played by Guy Pearce. Now when I say monster, I mean it.. when the villain in your film is scarier than Gary 'Scary' Oldman's roguish supporting work, you know you have one hell of an antagonist. Pearce, sporting a sour look and parted hair that Moses could lead his people through, is Charlie Rakes, some kind of government dispatched deputy whose sole purpose is to make out heroic trio's lives exceedingly difficult. Cheerfully sadistic and ruthlessly corrupt, Rakes is a bona fide moustache twirling psychopath and Pearce milks the role for all it's worth, as per usual in his case. Oldman does appear briefly but memorably as lively gangster Floyd Banner, a shark of a businessman with a fondness for tommy gun tantrums resulting in vehicular mayhem. The film walks a line between two distinct tones, which can be seen in the characteristics of the pair of older brothers: Hardy is laid back, laconic and ambles along at his own pace, which any film set in the south just has to have a bit of, whilst Clarke is volatile, fired up and hot blooded, also needed in crime fare. So you have a relaxed, violent, wistful piece with a mean streak that sneaks up on you more than a few times. Any Ozark tale wouldn't be complete without a romantic flair, as Hardy is swept off his feet by mysterious, plucky Jessica Chastain and Lebeouf has an eye for a beautiful Amish girl played by Mia Wasikowska. The film looks visually magnificent, shot in broad, sturdy rural strokes by Benoit Delhomme, and strict, impressive attention to detail is paid throughout. While maybe not as gritty or mythic as it wants to be, or at least as far as Hillcoat's previous work has been (The Proposition remains the stomach churning gold standard), it's a full blown, R rated crime picture, something more than welcome in an age when the genre has had its blood somewhat watered down. Highly recommended.",Lawless
65,kluseba,Not a good gangster movie,6,5 September 2012,"""Lawless"" is a rather boring gangster movie concerning the weak story line that is saved by some beautiful images of Western landscapes and a credible acting.Let's mention the young and naive characters of Jack Bondurant who is portrayed by a surprisingly good Shia LaBeouf, the silent and tough character of Forrest Bondurant played by a stunning Tom Hardy and a brutal and pitiless police officer incarnated by the great Guy Pearce. Some supporting actors such as the charming and innocent Mia Wasikowska who plays the daughter of a severe priest, the young and until then unknown to me Dane DeHaan who plays a naive acolyte of Jack Bondurant and the well known Gary Oldman who portrays a charismatic gangster boss. The acting and the relations between the characters are really the basis that holds this movie together and this concept works even though a lot of things are quite predictable.The film takes quite some time to kick off and after twenty minutes or so I was almost about to leave as nothing intriguing happened at all but then the movie got progressively better and towards the end, it was actually a good film. The first twenty or thirty minutes are though way too long and can't be justified as useful for the introduction of the characters or their development. The movie makers should have known that this kind of movie must start with a bang to grab the attention of the viewers from the first moments on and addict them to the characters that are then shown in a more profound way.Another negative point I must mention is the image of good and evil in this movie. Now, I'm not a conservative and not a friend of religious fanatics or brutal police squads but the image they get in this movie is simply filled with too many stereotypes. The movie wants you to believe that the police officer from Chicago is a pitiless and arrogant slayer but the older Bondurant brothers who are torturing people and cut off their testicles are shown and described as heroes and local legends which is simply biased. The local priest is shown as a severe and stubborn guy who controls his daughter but the man who simply wants to protect his daughter from a gang of local criminals that are battling with police forces isn't taken into consideration. The movie should have shown both police officers or priests and the criminals as negative and even sinful characters instead of creating a too superficial contrast of good and evil. This simplistic approach flawed the movie a little bit for me and remains quite subjective.What convinces in this movie among the actors and the beautiful images are many vintage gimmicks such as old cars and weapons that are shown throughout the film. One also gets a lot of dry humour that works quite well in some scenes. Some viewers might describe it as a little bit tasteless but it fits to the characters and has some sort of rude charm. This movie also includes gallons of blood and gore and some quite well done action sequences after half of the movie has passed. These scenes essentially help to raise the pace of this film that kicks off with a low as I wrote earlier.In the end, I didn't regret watching this movie after all but I wouldn't purchase it or watch it again anytime soon. There were are lot of flaws but in the end the positive elements were slightly superior to the negative ones. This film is definitely not a good gangster movie but an interesting character of family study despite the biased image of good and evil that mixes emotional with brutal moments. If you like the actors casted for this flick, you can go and watch it but if you happen to not know or like them, there is not much else this flick has to offer.",Lawless

Other plots come from the rise of Jack into this gangster world as his brother is recovering from a neck injury.The performances given by the mains are very strong with the way the overblown screenplay is. Hardy is the clear male standout but I would have to say that his grunting did get very weird how for stretches of time the only sound her made was that. The other main male was Shia LaBeouf as Jack the only brother with the most character growth as he went from a weak man to a confident man by the end of the film. Jason Clark plays the third brother and the one that was the least used only to be violent which is not a well rounded character.Guy Pearce as Charlie Rakes did not fit into the tone of this film because the character was over the top with his physical performance and his look of No eyebrows with a high pitched voice and slicked back black hair, that's why I did not like what Pearce did with this part as it was not in the realm of the film. Jessica Chastain and Mia Wasikowska are the main females but the script has written both not as great as these actresses are worth, Chastain gave another amazing performance to her career with her final scene even though quick was moving. Unlike Chastain, Wasikowska was wasted with the weak character development. Other actors wasted are Gary Oldman as a big gangster who is barely seen, also Dane DeHaan may have given a bad character when he death arrives it was emotional.Even though this film had it's high peaks the main problem I had was that the film was disappointing making some of my favourite actors wasted and some of my least favourite overused.MOVIE GRADE: B- (MVP: Tom Hardy)",Lawless

That is not to say it wasn't a good movie.

Based on a true story and having quite many big talent names, this movie can quite get the balance between the story and the scenario so that the stars can have enough duration to depict their significance in the story without being just a complementary cast. I like how the final conflict comes so fast without building up with time much time. I also like how the movie has quite a down played overall mood despite it's hard and violent tale. I like how Tom Hardy acted out his lead role here; he can really get the depiction of responsibility and determination on his brothers. Shia Lebouf depicts the kid brother nicely, showing off everywhere without really realizing the consequences. Jessica Chastain was bold enough to got total on her role here, and Mia Wasikowska and Gary Oldman gives just enough to breathe live to their respective characters.",Lawless
72,RatedVforVinny,Great cast but something slightly amiss?,7,19 December 2019,"I was slightly disappointed with 'Lawless' and found the prohibition period (surprisingly) less exciting here, than say 'The Untouchables' or 'Last Man Standing'. 'Lawless' is intense in places but fails to grip you into the plot. The writing by Nick Cave and his songs are a massive bonus but again compared to 'The Proposition', it lacks a real punch. The action though is exciting and it's a case graphic violence on screen; with Tom Hardy, grunting his way through the leading role.",Lawless
73,rgkarim,Moonshine Kingdom!,8,31 August 2012,"Who would have thought that Shia LaBeouf would have had such the career he has had? I know when I saw him on Even Stevens so many years ago, I never dreamed he would make it past Disney, but here he is three transformers, disturbia, and an Indiana Jones movie later and still making more films. The newest notch to his belt is this week's latest drama, entitled Lawless, a tale about the moonshine conspiracy in Franklin County. From the trailers I got very little about what this movie had to offer, so going into the theater I had no clue what to expect, other than Shia shouting his head off. What did my trip into the dark theater world reward me with? Read on as I share my thoughts on the Moonshine Kingdom world that is Lawless.To start this review off, I scoped IMDb for the cast today and realized that there were a lot of big name actors participating in this movie. Tom Hardy, Jason Clarke, Jessica Chastain and many more filled this film to the brim with star power. Now if you're like me, movies that are jammed with celebrities are usually shallow, fragmented plots that pretty much stink to the very core. Not this movie my friends. Rather than attempting to give all of the actors their fair share of screen time, director John Hillcoat focused on keeping the story fluent, developing the characters, and bringing the moonshine forest to life. Although some of my favorites like Gary Oldman have a fraction of the screen time from others, they have enough involvement or scene stealing moments to drive the story and make their performance memorable. Outside of these minor roles though, the casting crews picks were surprisingly spot on in this movie. To my surprise, Labeouf did a fantastic job with this movie, trading in the silly, arrogant, wisecracking Sam and actually having a three dimensional character with a wide range of involvement. The heroic journey his character took in this movie, force Labeouf to play many parts that I doubted he could play, such as a powerful smuggler, a hapless romantic, and a vengeful spirit. Yes he still likes to scream loud, but this time his rants have more gusto, purpose and drive behind them than his calling for robotic cars to save his butt. Helping to drive Labeouf's character development is Hardy. The British actor again amazed me as he somehow adapted a country, red neck accent that seemed to be as natural as half of my friends from high school. Accent aside, Hardy did a nice job playing this keystone character, managing to still use his tough guy stature to be threatening, but also softening up to show a gentler side. If you were a fan of his dynamic character in This Means War, then you might enjoy his performance in this movie, though this time the edge is a little more and the comedy is a little less than his spy counterpart. I could go on and on about the acting, but I suppose you want some more details about this film. Although I'm not the biggest fan of illegal crime dramas, this movie surprisingly held my interest. The character development in particular was nice to see as most of the characters had more than one side to them. Yes, for those who got tired of seeing comedic dribble spouting characters, your patience is awarded with this movie. Now this doesn't mean we just have characters sitting the park and opening up with a good cry. Instead these characteristics are pulled out as the smuggling operation evolves from a backwater delivery service into a moonshine empire. As the business grows and more people get to know Hardy and Labeouf, the two brothers begin to face more tangles in their world that push their characters to challenge their beliefs. The result of such dynamic characters is a story that keeps getting more interesting, and kept me in suspense about what would happen next. Although there were some obvious signs and predictable plot points, I was still uncertain at a few points in the movie. What else is there to tell about this movie? I guess those looking for a mafia shootout will be disappointed in the action of this movie. Instead of bank robberies and alcohol induced shooting rants; Lawless uses the firearms as more of a threat than an actual weapon. Countless scenes in the trailers of the characters holding guns, are accurate representations of what the characters actually do, standing there screaming instead of firing, the exception being Pearce's character. No the violence really comes in the form of harsh punishment such as beatings, slit throats, and torture than high adrenaline gun fights. As you can probably guess, these punishments are fairly graphic and I warn those with weak stomachs, or fainting at the site of blood. Being a rated R movie you can also bet there is plenty of cursing to support the southern accent heavy rage. However, the cursing is actually spread out and timed enough to not get stale, so I wasn't as annoyed or bothered this time. Other than that, the illegal bootlegging world is well portrayed in this movie and helps add that extra oomph to draw you further into the movie.Lawless is definitely a well casted and acted movie, and surprisingly entertained me for not knowing too much about it. Although there is some editing that could be done, this movie is worth a visit to the theater for the characters alone. Though again those who don't like bloody violence, and depressing, soulless acts, may want to see a kid's movie instead. My scores are below: Crime/Drama/Western: 8.5 Movie Overall: 7.5",Lawless

75,bob-rutzel-1,Pretty Good,7,31 January 2013,"This is based upon a true story of the bootlegging Bondurant brothers in Franklin County, Virginia during prohibition.It was widely known that the Bondurant brothers were considered indestructible and feared as they always survived everything that came at them. This story started when the brothers led by Forest (Tom Hardy) refused to pay kickbacks to the County Administrator. A Franklin County Special Deputy Charlie Rakes (Guy Pierce) is bent on breaking the Bondurants. Rakes has a mean streak in him. Very good performance all around including Shia Labeouf (yeah, I was surprised too) as Jack who later becomes the catalyst for the big shootout with County police. Jason Clark as Howard Bondurant is slowly climbing the ladder to stardom as I have never seen a bad performance from him. Keep an eye. But, it was Tom Hardy as Forest who had the fewest lines in here who was the most compelling as you knew from the get-go he had it all together. He didn't need to do much talking. Some of the fight scenes in the beginning were brutal and bloody especially when Rakes meets Jack. I cringed many times as that one-sided fight went on for a long time. It just looked too real. I thought about going to the ER. just in case. The only discrepancy I saw was that the yards outside the houses, and out-buildings were swept too clean and everything was too neat. A picky point, I know, but there you are. You just couldn't help noticing. It didn't seem right. Jessica Chastain (as Maggie) and Mia Wasikoska (as Bertha) were the love interests of Forest and Jack. Gary Oldman as Floyd Banner makes a short appearance as a friendly rival to the Bondurants. Overall well done and the music helped at times. (7/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: Yes, briefly.

Unfortunately, Lawless is tedious through and through. It's sequences go from bursts of heartless violence to development-less talking. The problem is its atmosphere, which could also be attributed to the choice of digital photography. It tries to be gritty, with its music hinting back to one of my favourite western TV shows, Deadwood, but the slick cinematography is just completely lifeless. It just feels like nobody's heart was truly in it (besides Guy Peace's menacing villain) with no chemistry between anyone. It was a huge mistake to try and force some romance subplots in here. There's nothing too bad about Lawless, besides its humourless and cold approach, it's just disappointingly average given the talent. 6/10",Lawless
77,MartianOctocretr5,"Lots of blood, not much story telling",5,8 September 2012,"Run of the mill shoot 'em up stuff. Little character development, a thin story thread, and dialog that sounds like it could have been written by a pro wrestler in five minutes; this movie really only focuses on the violence aspect.Some Prohibition era bootleggers are running amok in the backwoods someplace, and there's (not again) local law enforcement corruption, complete with dullard cops looking the other way. A Fed with Silent Era movie star slicked back hair is called in to clean up Dodge, and takes his job a bit too seriously. There's adequate attention to period costumes, automobiles, weapons, and slang to bring out the era well, and that's the movie's strongest point.Whatever story the writer originally intended doesn't make it to the screen. The director relegates everything to an over-the-top cops 'n' robbers blood fest, with little explanation of who's who, or what their objectives are. Other than croaking each other, that is. There's not a single scene in this movie where someone doesn't get the snot beaten out of them, smashed with a heavy blunt object, or shot (usually multiple times). The plot never explores anything about any of these people, but sure leaves a lot of them bleeding profusely on the ground.Then there's the character from whose point of view the story is told. He's a brainless punk who moonshines, sees all this violence, gets threatened several times, and continues to bootleg in the midst of all these lunatics like nothing has happened. The actions of other characters don't make much more sense than that, either.If you like high action and violence for its own sake, and couldn't care less who's getting blasted, then this film is fine.

78,saadgkhan,Something is missing badly in Lawless,6,6 December 2012,"Lawless - CATCH IT (B) Having high expectations mostly leads to disappointments and that's what happens with Lawless. On paper and on screen the movie has everything perfect a thrilling and brutal true story of a bootlegging gang is threatened by a new deputy and other authorities who want a cut of their profits during Depression-era Franklin County, Virginia. A great cast Tom Hardy, Shia LaBeouf, Jessica Chastain, Mia Wasikowska, Dane Dehaan, Gary Oldman, and Guy Pearce and production value. Somehow all this didn't jell together well on screen. I would blame director, editor, screenplay writer and Tom Hardy for it. The direction was okay but weak screenplay and cut to cut small scenes didn't make any sense at all. Rather than giving strong dialogues and long enough scenes to understand the characters, we're thrown into this criminal world without being able to make any attachments to any of the character oh except Dan Dehaan. Tom Hardy is a good actor but he was a totally miscast in it. His dialogues were hard to understand even by southern. And when his throat was cut, afterwards it would have been better to keep him mute. In the end when he is wounded and tries to take out gun to shoot Guy Pearce, it was just hilarious. I have never seen a worst body language than that in serious movie. Shia LaBeouf is a good actor no doubt about it and he did a fantastic job, firstly as naive younger brother and later as strong family caretaker. Jessica Chastain is amazing though she doesn't get much scope to shine in it. Mia Wasikowska is innocent and looks the part. Dane Dehaan is superb; no doubt he steals the show in which ever few scenes he was in. This boy will be huge soon. Guy Pearce is creepy, so it means great. Gary Oldman doesn't get much scope.In the end, I wanted to love it but I couldn't... It was just forgettable. This is not a great thing considering the genre and talent attached.",Lawless
79,rivertam26,Solid,7,17 September 2012,"From John Hillcoat director of the under rated film The Road comes this solid true story of a group of brothers who are bootleggers during the height of prohibition. The film follows 3 brothers Forrest (Tom Hardy), Jack (Shia Labeouf and Howard (Jason Clarke) who run a small moonshine business and their respective separate story lines.Forrest is looking to keep things small but Jack is more ambitious and is looking to prove himself as a man. They're little outfit comes under siege from the new sadistic deputy Charlie Raes played by Guy Pearce. Along the way a new woman comes into town and applies to tend their small restaurant for them Maggie played by Jessica Chastain and jack falls for the local preacher's daughter Bertha Minnix played by Mia Wasikowski. The film is engaging enough for most of its running time and chronicles Forest and Jacks character growth decently enough during the course of the film but this does feel more like Jacks film than anyone else's. We see him from a savage beat down and grow into a man after a tragic incident all while falling for Bertha along the way. Shai Labeouf's performance is solid if a little expected, Tom Hardy is good as always as Forrest however I think he might think he is better than he actually is. His acting skills need a little fine tuning, despite the role it seems like it's always along the lines of the same performance. Stoic, Hulking and simplistic. Which worked well enough in films like Warrior and Dark Knight but feels a little awkward here especially in the films more emotionally engaging moments he comes off a bit blank. Jason Clarke is given way less to do as Howard than the other two brothers but leaves the biggest impression amongst the 3 his subtle unaffected performance flows more naturally. The two female supporting cast in the film don't really have big roles in the film Jessica Chastain is solid as always giving her Maggie a haunted past teased but unspoken and scintillating sexuality and Mia Wasikowski is decent enough here and comes off light and pretty and sports decent chemistry with LaBeouf. There are some light pacing issues in the films first half and an overwhelmingly amateur quality amongst all the proceedings which is odd cause this is not a first time director. That being said the film is solid enough to merit a recommendation it's historical backbone even if it doesn't feel much like the time period most of the time, interesting characters and solid performances over rule some questionable directorial glitches. It's an entertaining film if an uninspired one that doesn't really bring anything new to its sub genre but is a solid feat none the less.",Lawless
80,Screen_Blitz,"Lawless is an engaging picture, though not at the height of other Prohibition crime-dramas",7,20 February 2016,"This Prohibition-set drama does not quite the reach the heights of the classic entries of the mobster genre, but it certainly offers a compelling, if somewhat flawed rendition of crime story set during the roaring twenties. The masterhand behind this violent tale is director John Hillcoat ('The Road'), who takes the pages of Matt Bondurant's novel 'The Wettest County in The World' and constructs a violent, but polished look into the sobering world of law vs. men where the law officials and the law breakers swap sides on the moral compass. Set in 1931 Virginia, this film stars Shia Labeouf as Jack Bondurant, a timid young man who runs an illegal bootlegging operation with his brothers Forrest (played by Tom Hardy) and Howard (played by Jason Clarke). When their unlawful business captures the eyes of a corrupt law official Charley Rakes (played by Guy Pierce), he and his henchmen including the sadistic Floyd Banner (played by Gary Oldman) make it their mission to shut their brothers' business down. When the brothers rebel against the vicious lawmen, Rakes wages war against the brothers that puts their waitress Maggie Beauford (played by Jessica Chastain) and their mentally impaired friend Cricket (played by Dane DeHaan) in grave danger. As a historical outlaw vs. law enforcement crime-drama, this one is neither derivative nor out of the ordinary. But it offers a riveting rendition of a trio of outlaws caught in the crossfires of corrupt lawmen who threaten to tear them down. From the cogent storytelling, to the sharp commentary of corruption in the law enforcement, to the sleek visual imagery of 1930s Virginia, John Hillcoat leaves solid proves that he knows the Prohibition genre quite well. The story journeys through a blood-soaked conflict between the three main character and the antagonist that though offers some visceral thrills, suffers from an inconsistent pacing during the first half and is a little uneven at various points with numerous subplots thrown crowding around. One of the subplots such as the romance between Shia Labeouf and Mia Wasikowska is somewhat charming and peppers a small dose of levity in the dark atmosphere, but perhaps doesn't quite sizzle. However, Hillcoat delivers just enough tension between the protagonists and the sadistic antagonists to keep the story in momentum. When our characters engage in violent episodes of western-style shootouts that end in bloodshed, that is when the tension reaches its peak. While these sequences show a rather harsh edge, they serve as the main source for propelling the plot.Shia LaBeouf gives an astonishingly sincere performance in his role that defies expectations from he brought to his loathed role in the 'Transformers' franchise. Tom Hardy is very compelling as the quiet, but stern brain of the bootlegging operation as is Jason Clarke as the more brooding brother of the trio. These three prove to be very believable as the main trio, and the camaraderie they establish throughout the picture is surprisingly quite subtle. The real force to be reckoned with though, comes from Guy Pearce with his powerful performance as the ruthless antagonist. Gary Oldman who is no stranger for stepping in villainous roles, is exactly many would expect him to be: a sadistic villain with blood for vengeance. Whether this performance falls in the category of Oscar caliber is debatable. Dane DeHaan delivers a nice impression of his role as the mentally impaired buddy of Shia Labeouf, a performance that pays fair nostalgia to Leonardo Dicaprio's role in 'What's Eating Gilbert Grape'. Jessica Chastain who plays their waitress is effectively charming as is Mia Wasikowska as the rebellious daughter of a church minister and later becomes the lover of Shia LaBeouf's character; nothing in the performance department to disappoint.Lawless may not be as powerful and enthralling as the critically crime-dramas of today, but is very engaging and entertaining experience with decent performances, a visceral outlaw story, and the fine script that works just fine. It is violent and startlingly brutal at various times, but paints an authentic picture on the crime life during the Prohibition era.",Lawless

82,napierslogs,Another failing for the western genre,6,26 August 2012,"I have never understood the appeal of Westerns, and although prohibition is an interesting era, ""Lawless"" still doesn't give me an insight into the popularity of the genre. We have cowboys - rugged ones, loyal ones, and corrupt ones - which is exactly like we've seen them before. And they're fighting over money, mostly their right to make it.Tom Hardy is channelling John Wayne, and based on other reviews, that is supposedly a good thing! Wayne did in fact win an Oscar, but he's more accurately regarded as a popular actor who played the same role over and over again with little skill. Then again, Tom Hardy's name appears to have been built by a PR machine so perhaps there is no better hero for him.There should be something more to this genre though. ""Lawless"" is a classic gangster conflict where bootlegging brothers rise up against the corrupt local politicians and law officials. And they rise up with violence and nothing else. The effort put into the scenery should have had the same effort put into the characterizations. Or at least the dialogue. Isn't there something we can do about the extreme Southern drawl (all put on by actors who don't come about it naturally) with grammatical inaccuracies?

The cinematography is equally impressive and contributes to an overall well made film.Having said that, 'Lawless' is nothing special and will probably soon be forgotten.

85,dglink,An Earnest Effort that Fails to Fully Succeed,6,31 December 2014,"Deep in the Great Depression, Prohibition was the law of the land, and the three enterprising Bondurant brothers, Jack, Forrest, and Howard, set up a clandestine distillery and get into the lucrative bootleg moonshine business. However, the Franklin-County-Virginia boys are not willing to share the profits and will not bribe corrupt local officials, who subsequently bring in a special deputy to ruthlessly pursue the brothers. Leisurely directed by Australian John Hillcoat from a novel written by Matt Bondurant, ""Lawless"" has a fine period feel, enhanced by Benoit Delhomme's cinematography and songs by The Bootleggers and Emmylou Harris. The script, by musician Nick Cave, was based on Bondurant's story of his grandfather and two granduncles. While the efforts throughout are earnest and creditable, the results fail to excite. Although the influence of ""Bonnie and Clyde"" can be discerned throughout, Arthur Penn's classic masterfully mixed humor, gore, and romance, and moved at a faster pace. Hillcoat offers a bullet-ridden car, a bloody beating, and some graphic knifing scenes, but the victims are undeveloped characters, and viewers remain distanced and unmoved by their plight.The three brothers are well played in low-key performances by Tom Hardy, Jason Clarke, and Shia LaBeouf, although none are particularly memorable and could easily be replaced by others. Always interesting to watch, Jessica Chastain has a small, but memorable role, and Gary Oldman appears briefly as gangster Floyd Banner. Unfortunately, Guy Pearce enjoys way too much screen time. As deputy Charlie Rakes, Pearce sports an oily slicked-down hairstyle parted down the middle, and he need only twirl a mustache to fully mimic a silent-movie villain from ""The Perils of Pauline."" Although he resembles Snidley Whiplash, Pearce is described as a ""nance"" by one character, and viewers can almost smell the cheap perfume oozing from his pores. Pearce is over-the-top as a dastardly villain. His performance throws the film off kilter and is completely out of sync with the underplaying of the other actors. A thinly motivated killing seems thrown in only to emphasize that Rakes is a really really bad guy.""Lawless"" has a lot to like, but even the earnest collaboration of talent can fall flat; the old adage ""less than the sum of its parts"" applies here. The film is worth a look for patient viewers and those interested in the fact-based topic.

Working against this is the slack pacing that never really builds to anything that exciting.

However, in this one he manages to find a good vehicle to change his tact.We are in prohibition time, in the countryside in Virginia. The men are tough and they enforce their own law protecting their moonshine businesses. However they aren't the cringing redneck cliché of many other films; this isn't Deliverance. This is a dark movie where it seems those outwith of the religious community live and survive by force. In comes law enforcers from outside led by a sadistic sergeant, and we have an explosive mix.Again, don't get the wrong impression. This film isn't about gung-ho good v evil. This is a lot more. Based on a true story (albeit likely taking big liberties with the truth), this is about the relationship of three brothers: two are ruthless whilst the third (Le Beouf) is weak. They look out for each other and that's the real nub.Action comes generally in short sharp moments, but thankfully doesn't detract from the rest of the movie.

His attempts at a southern-American accent fall a bit short, and most of his dialog here is a quiet mish-mash of ""what the heck did he just say?"".Hardy's character is likable, and tough, and Hardy can act, but Shia is the stand-out in this boot-legging duo. Labeouf's character is thoroughly examined, and he really carries this film.THe film pulls you in, but then later loses the audience with one-too-many frequent recoveries from serious injury - almost to the point where it becomes laughable. I started to wonder when Bones and the rest of the Star Trek Enterprise would appear from around the corner with their magic-recovery body scanner to fix these guys injuries. Ultimately, we get a film so hell-bent on a Hollywood ending that it really, truly suffers from it.The production values were good, and the films first 45 minutes are top notch.This is without a doubt one of the better ""6"" rated movies I've ever reviewed or rated. If you had asked me half-way through I'd have said it was going to be a 8-8.5 type of film.You'll like this if you liked: Public Enemies(slightly better), Untouchables(better), Purgatory(about even), Young Guns(about even) or Once Upon a Time in America Dir Cut(much, much better).",Lawless

92,Geeky Randy,Geeky Randy's summary,7,5 June 2015,"Entertaining tale based on THE WETTEST COUNTY IN THE WORLD by Matt Bondurant about the author's grandfather Jack (LaBeouf) and his two older brothers (Clarke and Hardy) running their own moonshine operation during Prohibition and the allies and foes they make when the Chicago mob comes to town wanting a piece of the action. A pleasantly unique mixture of THE UNTOUCHABLES, TOMBSTONE, LEGENDS OF THE FALL and BOARDWALK EMPIRE, with an incredibly colorful villain played by Pearce. The battles are graphic, but the aftermaths are a bit too glorified. LaBeouf delivers okay but is ultimately wrong for the role what with being so outshined by Hardy that you're pretty indifferent to the main character's fate. Extra brownie points for an interesting rendition of ""White Light/White Heat"". Screenplay by Nick Cave yes, of the Bad Seeds, who also makes a cameo.*** (out of four)",Lawless
93,JohnRayPeterson,This is a really fine movie,8,19 November 2012,"This is a really fine movie; there is a subtle difference between a work of which you would say 'the movie was fine' and the deliberate syntax I chose: 'fine movie '. If you can appreciate the nuance, you can appreciate the performances delivered by the superb cast. Indeed the producers and or directors as well as those responsible for casting the likes of Tom Hardy, Guy Pierce, Gary Oldman, Shia LaBeouf, Jason Clarke, Jessica Chastain and Mia Wasikoska must be commended for their choice. The filmographies of Pierce, Hardy, Oldman, LaBeouf and Wasikoska made this a film I would not have missed, one I awaited with as much anticipation as the next Bond flick, but not for the same reasons. These five consummate professionals were impeccable in depicting characters of Matt Bondurant's novel.Add outstanding co-lead of Jason Clarke, Jessica Chastain (movie The Help) and Dane DeHaan, not to mention very good supporting performances by Noah Taylor and others, and this brilliant ensemble could have only failed to bring us quality work if the direction had not been up to par; director John Hillcoat, whose movies The Road and The Proposition I also highly recommend, did as well as he has in his previous movies. He knows how to play the audience by holding back just enough to keep you wanting more and to give you time to feel the emotions the actors put into their respective characters. Each character has strong deeply rooted personas; it was a thrill to see some of my favourite actors deliver that on screen. Hardy has that modern quiet intense John Wayne charisma about him, Pierce plays the sadistic law officer inebriated by his authority, LaBeouf the gentle soul who overcomes the weakness his brothers tried to help reform; LaBeouf has the most screen time as he goes through a greater maturing transition called by his character. One part of LaBeouf's transition was falling in love with the natural beauty that is Mia Wasikoska (terrific lead role in the movie Jane Eyre), and he does that very convincingly. Mind you, she looks sweet and her character is most endearing; I dreamt of seeing her face on the pillow next to mine the next morning.As the storyline implies, this is a period piece, one with the sort of action you should expect for its backdrop. I liked that the director chose not to depict any of his characters in the usual hillbilly clichés. Unless you don't like or care for period pieces, and even then, I recommend this movie; you need to see good acting performances by this ensemble of pros.",Lawless

It felt like another one of those ""look at how great and creative we are because we made a depressing and thought provoking movie"" movies. Shia LaBeouf loves to pick these sorts of movies because it seems to make him feel like he is above the rest of the Hollywood crowd, but in reality this movie just is not very good.The scenes are dull and the storyline is so slow-paced that it feels like nothing is happening and that there is no point to this creation. Look I respect that some people will love this movie because it is their style of movie but honestly if you want to be entertained and engrossed in a movie then this is not the one for you.",Lawless
95,DonFishies,"A brutally violent, wildly uneven disappointment",5,27 August 2012,"Based on a true story, the Bondurants were bootleggers selling their Moonshine to whoever would buy within the South during the Great Depression. The three brothers: Jack (Shia LaBeouf), Forrest (Tom Hardy) and Howard (Jason Clarke); were legendary in their parts of Virginia, and also one of the few groups left not selling their wares through a higher authority. With the competition slowly bought out, dirty Deputy Charlie Rakes (Guy Pearce) begins looking for ways to buy out the Bondurant's small fortune, or take them out one-by-one. And rather obviously, the Bondurants are not ones to go down without a fight.Simply put, Lawless is a mess from start to finish. At any given moment, it feels like a totally different film - a gangster picture, a brutal revenge thriller, an unintentional buddy comedy, a romantic melodrama and even a little bit of a heartfelt coming-of-age film. It never seems to have any semblance of an idea of what it wants to be at any point. I have read since that the source material, Matt Bondurant's novel The Wettest County in the World, was a bit all over the place too in this regard. While that is fine for the book, it makes for an exhausting film experience. I had no idea what I should be feeling, and considering how restless the crowd seemed at the wildly shifting tonal structure, it seems like I was not the only one.The storyline is a little bit too undercooked as well. It is quite the wildly entertaining story, made even wilder by being based on truth. But the time-line is never really set-up properly, leading to a lot of odd time lapses and at least one clumsy montage (looking like it was ripped straight out of Brian De Palma's Scarface). While an odd structure like this may just feel like nitpicking, it drastically effects the character motivations, or lack thereof. At one point, Forrest and Howard take revenge into their own hands and act in such a grisly manner, that the camera barely even lets you see what is happening. But in the next scene, they are just good old boys trying to hide their Moonshine- running business from pesky invaders. Much like the shifts in tone, it feels like the characters experience the very same shifts in character motivation and development. And it only gets sloppier as the film keeps progressing.The acting does not fare much better.LaBeouf is clearly over his head trying to carry the film, and he almost collapses under its weight. He overdoes it in some instances, and does not put nearly enough effort into other places. This is really his first leading, non-gimmicky role, and it shows in how wildly inexperienced he comes off. He is never quite believable as anything other than a careless kid on the outside looking in. And while this works for parts of the film, during the really heavy moments, it flops near horrendously. I wanted to believe in LaBeouf's character's struggle, and wanted to really feel something for the brotherly dynamic between him, Hardy and Clarke. But outside of a few playful, near out-of-character moments, there is no real reason to feel anything but disappointment.Hardy and Clarke are clearly game for the material (when you can decipher what either of them are saying), but are clearly being held back by the confines of their underwritten characters. They are supposed to be menacing, and are supposed to be indestructible forces of nature. But I never gathered that watching either of their interactions with anyone else. Sure, they were brutal powerhouses, but I did not believe they were as scary as some of the dialogue hints they could be. Pearce, gleefully at peace overacting and riffing on Christoph Waltz's character from Inglourious Basterds, seems to really be trying to make something out of his character. But for all the scenery chewing and devious one- liners, he is sadly reduced to a one-dimensional throwaway villain. Despite figuring heavily into the trailers, Gary Oldman is criminally underused as gangster Floyd Banner. He has less than 10-minutes of screen time, and is given practically no reason to be in the film other than to move the characters from Point A to Point B.Similar fates are bestowed on Jessica Chastain, Mia Wasikowska, and Dane DeHaan - all give well done performances, but simply exist either to brighten the film up from the often grim subject matter or to help establish a plot point the dialogue cannot.If there is one thing I can point out as being done right, it is the look of the film. There is an aura of nostalgia that emanates around almost every scene, lovingly bringing us back to a time that has been practically forgotten. The costumes, the sets, the cinematography - all come together as one for a really beautiful and inspiring showcase. And while it does maintain its beauty throughout, it does get incredibly gritty during the surprisingly scenes of brutal violence. It took me a back by just how far some of the scenes go, and may make some audience goers incredibly uneasy. After seeing so much go wrong, it was nice to see something done so right.Lawless took years to get made (along with a few title changes). And after seeing the final product, a near catastrophic wreck, I can only begin to surmise why. It is a disappointment through and through, with some interesting but underwritten performances, a wildly uneven story and some of the most brutal violence I have seen all year. Some may read its quirky nature as being the film's true salvation and reason it is so much better than other films like it. But it is just as easy to see right through the façade and realize just how deeply disappointing Lawless is.5/10.",Lawless
96,griffolyon12,A Strong Character Piece,8,5 December 2012,"John Hillcoat's film, Lawless, is a one of a kind gangster flick. Rather than being about gangsters in the big city, it follows three brothers who run a moonshine operation during Prohibition in rural Virginia, attracting the attention of the new, hard-nosed deputy looking to crack down on moonshine. This film's not so much an action movie, but it's more a film about a young man trying to prove himself, as the youngest brother, Jack, played by Shia LaBeouf, dreams of being a big-time gangster and being worthy of his family name. Featuring a magnificent performance by Tom Hardy as the oldest brother, Forrest, and a nasty Guy Pearce as the villainous deputy from the big city, the film manages to carry along, even in its slow paces, thanks to the charismatic portrayals from the likes of Hardy, Pearce, and LaBeouf. While the gunfight finale is anti-climactic, the film's a strong character piece with a surprisingly happy ending.I give Lawless an 8 out of 10!",Lawless

And the era itself has already been described so many times that it is almost impossible to tell something new. In such cases, only the cast can be of interest. And in this regard, Lawless hits exactly the target. This is a great cast. That Tom Hardy, that Guy Pierce fit perfectly into his roles. Yes, Shia LaBeouf played his role perfectly, as did Jessica Chastain. An excellent film that critics probably did not like at one time. This is a purely spectator simple movie.",Lawless
99,cardsrock,Pretty decent,7,3 January 2021,"Even if this film feels like it didn't quite reach its potential, it's still a fairly watchable Prohibition-era drama. The cast is excellent with Tom Hardy leading the way and picking up the slack for Shia LaBeouf. Gary Oldman was shockingly underutilized though and Guy Pearce is great for most of the film, but goes a bit off the rails at the end. The action is solid, however the story doesn't really seem to go anywhere and set up a lot of lingering plot threads. Lawless isn't a masterpiece by any means, but it's a worthwhile watch.",Lawless
100,Laakbaar,Shia shines in this violent but interesting movie set in rural Virgina in the 1920s,8,24 November 2012,"""Lawless"" tells the story of the Bondurant brothers, a tough bunch with a legend of invincibility. Like many others in the county, they produced and sold a potent moonshine called ""White Lightning"" during the Prohibition years.The law had little to say to these bootleggers until Special Agent Charlie Rakes showed up. It turned out that he was...well, a sadistic, racist psycho. And a psycho who wanted a piece of the action. Forrest Bondurant (played by Tom Hardy) was not about to put up with it.Much of the movie hinged on Forrest's youngest brother Jack (played by Shia LaBoeuf), a kid who was coming of age and lacked the toughness and experience of his older brothers. He was eager to prove that he was a good criminal and to impress Bertha (played by Mia Masikowska), a Mennonite girl.I thought the actors in the movie were well cast and played their roles believably. LaBoeuf and Hardy each exude strong physical magnetism and this helps make the movie. Pierce shows once again that he is an A-List actor with considerable range.This movie has a very strong sense of place and time. To me, this was perhaps the best feature of the film. The Virginia countryside plays a major role in the film. The director went to some length to recreate life in Franklin County in the 1920s. I came out of it with the sense of having a strong understanding of what local people and society must have been like there almost a century ago.I was particularly struck by the portrayal of the Mennonite service. To me, that was a history lesson wrapped in movie magic. Laboeuf's performance in that scene in particular was really quite good. I wish that scene had lasted longer.I felt the script had a few issues. The focus on the Forrest and Jack characters meant that other aspects were not explained or developed enough. Also, in general, I'm not good with stories that make criminals the heroes and lawmen the villains. This reversal-of-the-moral-universe aspect is unrealistic to me. Undeserved redemption is dissatisfying.The film was far too violent for my (admittedly squeamish) taste. Although they did shy from some scenes, much more of it could have been implied or cut back without detracting a whit from the quality or meaning of the film.The tarring and feathering was gratuitous really, I have never seen this horror portrayed realistically on film (and I hope I never see it again). I also question the accuracy of this film's portrayal of petroleum tar being used. Surely no one could survive that? It would have to be heated to a very high temperature and would solidify on cooling. Although I'm glad I saw this film, I would have skipped it if I had known about the violence.I think this movie is probably worth about a 7, but I'm going to raise that one notch because of the strong performance by LaBoeuf and the film's other good points.",Lawless

102,rubenm,"Graphic violence, illegal booze and pretty girls",7,22 September 2012,"Lawless is not a movie for the faint-hearted. The violence will be a turn-off for many people, since it is very graphic and very frequent. I suspect this movie will appeal mainly to men - the main themes, apart form the violence, are illegal booze and pretty girls. Lawless is the story of three brothers who distill alcohol during the prohibition. They have started to believe the legend that they are invincible, since on several occasions they escaped death and disaster. That's why they decide not to pay any bribes to corrupt law enforcers, thus instigating a local war with the ambitious assistant sheriff. The story is told form the perspective of the younger brother, who tries hard to imitate his ruthless older brothers, but keeps on making mistakes, sometimes with deadly consequences. Two of the brothers pursue their respective love interests, played by two young and rising Hollywood stars: Jessica Chastain and Mia Wasikowska. Chastain plays a former striptease dancer who has fled the violence in gang-ridden Chicago, only to find more violence in rural Franklin County. Wasikowska is the local preacher's daughter, who evolves from a shy, obedient girl to a fun loving young woman, enjoying the gangster lifestyle of the brothers. Guy Pearce is worth mentioning as one of the creepiest and most disturbing characters in recent cinema history. His sheriff is a sadist who is more concerned about his hairdo and his immaculate clothing than about the fate of his enemies. More than once, Lawless reminded me of Arthur Penn's Bonnie and Clyde. Also, Sam Peckinpah seems to be a source of inspiration, particularly in the long, no-holds-barred final shootout. The last scene, following the shootout and showing the brothers as happy family men after the prohibition has ended, was a bit out of place. Apart from that, Lawless is a good, exciting period film. The excessive violence may be too much for some people, but is an inevitable ingredient in the life of gangsters and law enforcers in the prohibition era.",Lawless

104,TheSquiss,"Adequate & even rewarding but, at best, an over-inflated short film & an opportunity wasted.",6,31 August 2012,"Back in the day, Hollywood proudly publicized certain films as having 'all star casts' and presented the world with the likes of Grand Hotel and Around the World in 80 Days. It rarely happens nowadays because the studio system crashed and movie stars discovered they could charge fees that make premiership footballers look like paupers. However, in recent years a fresh crop of star-heavy films have emerged with actors deciding they like working together for a great director and a fantastic (sometimes) screenplay more than fat paychecks. As a result we, the cineastes, have been treated to the likes of Ocean's 11, Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy and Inception. And now Lawless.Maybe Lawless isn't quite an 'all star cast' vehicle yet but give it a month and the stock of each of these principals will rise. Which ones? Well, let's start with Tom Hardy, Jessica Chastain, Shia LaBeouf, Guy Pearce, Mia Wasikowska and then consider the supporting cast including the ever-watchable Noah Taylor and that little-known star-in-the-makingGary Oldman! So, with a cast to drool over, what of the film? Lawless is reputedly based on true events as depicted in the novel The Wettest County in the World by Matt Bondurant, grandson and great nephew of the brotherly trinity whose story he tells. Jack, Forrest and Howard Bondurant (LaBeouf, Hardy and Jason Clarke) are three petty criminals who barely earning a living by distilling moonshine in the prohibition years. When Special Deputy Charlie Rakes (Pearce) strides into town stinking of perfume and carrying a whole heap of corruption with him, what was a subtle business serving the community turns into something altogether bigger and nastier.Lawless looks as though it's the kind of film the critics will love. The trailer implies the action of The Untouchables and the intensity of The Road to Perdition but it falls short of both excellent films. It's a middling film, a movie that isn't quite sure what to be. With some heavy editing, excising of extraneous characters and a shot of adrenalin to 'up' the pace, it would make a stunning short. Alternatively, an additional 45 minutes of depth and character study might make it a slow-burning, gently brooding and far more satisfying film in a similar vein to Open Range. As it stands, Lawless is a plodding film that's worth a look but certainly doesn't warrant a second viewing.There are too many characters with too little to do, too many relationships left unexplored, too little development, too little excitement, too little depth. It all feels superficial; a précis of an epic, albeit one that stretches on for 115 minutes.Too many characters are glossed over and become almost pointless. Gary Oldman plays little more than a cameo that could easily have been dropped but really should have been given greater emphasis. Bertha (Wasikowska), as Jack's love interest is allowed to gently blossom but the relationship with her father, which hints at a subplot worth exploring, is allowed to simply evaporate. Howard Bondurant is almost the invisible brother and Maggie (Chastain), though she fares better, always seems to be floating around the edge of a deeper storyline that would add so much to a film that desperately needs some oomph. What a pity the picture wasn't painted from her perspective and brought to life with her complex palette of emotions. It would have been a far richer experience.LaBeouf comes close to redeeming himself for the crime that was Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull with a performance that suggests he could be a pretender to Leonardo DiCaprio's throne. But the acting isn't the issue with Lawless. Without obvious exception, the performances are believable and enjoyable, particularly Hardy, who enjoys the majority of the memorable lines and grunts, though his silences are equally enthralling. Pearce staggers into melodrama as the villain who could have slipped out of Who Framed Roger Rabbit but he's entertaining nonetheless.The fault rests squarely with director John Hillcoat (The Road, The Proposition) and screenwriter Nick Cave (yes, that one). Though there are some wonderful asides and verbal exchanges that even garner a few light laughs (largely courtesy of Hardy's delivery), the plot-flattened screenplay and direction are stodgy and laboured. No, it's not moody, it's just dangerously close to boring. Fortunately, Lawless doesn't quite slip that far.The distinct lack of depth and activity from protagonists and peripheral characters implies a simple story drawn out beyond all reason. But Lawless is adequate, it's even rewarding but I'm guessing that by the time the new year looms and I review my film intake for the year, I'll struggle to remember more about it than that Forrest was broader that written because Tom Hardy came to the shoot straight after bulking up for Bane.Let's just hope that January 2013's Gangster Squad is an 'all star cast' flick that truly lives up to the claims and the expectations.IMDb Footer: For more reviews from The Squiss subscribe to my blog at www.thesquiss.co.uk Like the Facebook page: http://on.fb.me/RpitOG",Lawless
105,cultfilmfreaksdotcom,Moon Shines,7,17 September 2012,"Fans of 1970's cinema or television have seen this kinda story a thousand times over: backwoods siblings run moonshine and go up against the law. But this is a true story of the Bondurant brothers and how they beat the odds – and then some.The bros couldn't be more different: there's the tough as nails Forrest (Tom Hardy), who can't die no matter what's thrown at him; Howard, the rock steady oldest; and the youngest, Jack (Shia LaBeouf in a worthy performance), who lacks guts and backbone. This is the perfect character to follow through the first half as he learns from his experienced elders how the game is played.Threatened into partnering with a crooked deputy, played with snarky bravado by Guy Pearce, the brothers decide to keep running things their way – and wind up close to dead and penniless. That's when Jack takes the smart move (ala Al Pacino in THE GODFATHER) and joins with mobster Gary Oldman... and the money flows.The women are gorgeous and talented but don't do much for the story. Jessica Chastain's subtle romance with Tom Hardy's lethal quiet man seems more filler than Jack's chaste courtship with the preacher's mousy, soft-spoken daughter. But LAWLESS is all about the ultra-violence between the crooked lawmen and the ""invincible"" Bondurants, who hold their ground till the bloody end: although the first half, as the tension builds, packs more wallop than the somewhat gratuitous resolution.With so many antagonists, it's tough to figure what the brother's are fighting for, or what they're up against, exactly. Yet Pearce makes a worthy maverick villain, and if anything else, you'll root for his downfall alone.For More Reviews: www.cultfilmfreaks.com",Lawless
106,dfle3,A terrific (true?) story. 87.5+%,9,24 October 2012,"This movie is based on a book written by a relative of some of the main characters depicted in this movie...just looked up Wikipedia, and the author was Matt Bondurant, whose grandfather, Jack Bondurant, is called ""the runt of the litter"" of the Bondurant brothers featured in this tale of moonshiners in the age of Prohibition in America. That book was called ""The wettest county in the world"" and the title refers to how much illegal alcohol was produced in that area. The novel was adapted for cinema by Australian alternative rock icon Nick Cave.The story concerns how the Bondurant's once cozy relationship with sympathetic rural police is changed by the arrival of a corrupt Chicago law enforcement officer, Charlie Rakes (played by Australian Guy Pearce), who wants a cut of the Bondurant's illegal liquor business. Forrest Bondurant (Tom Hardy) is not one to cave in to these demands. Things get ugly, but there is some romance in this movie too.Whilst being a terrific yarn, the quirky central performances won't garner any Oscar attention, I wouldn't think. Guy Pearce's dandy/fop take on Charlie Rakes is highly stylised and amusing before he just becomes a plain horrible character. Tom Hardy's take on Forrest Bondurant incorporates many big cat like purrs, which also amuse.Set in America's South, you mostly hear Southern drawls, so if Cave's screenplay is any good, you will miss a chunk of it unless you can decipher the more unintelligible dialogue in this movie...which I couldn't, but I understood enough of it not to lose the plot. Early on in the film, the reality of life in the South is not elided...you will see signs of racial segregation...literally.Even though this movie doesn't have a lot of violence in it, when it does occur, it is bloody and horrific...both in what you actually see happen and the horrific implied violence which you do not see...except for the aftermath. These moments can be very confronting...it's horror movie territory.Since the movie is based on a book by a member of the Bondurant family, you have to wonder how much is fictionalised in order to paint the clan in a positive light. Watching the end of the movie, concerning a final confrontation with Charlie Rakes, you have to wonder if it really happened that way.Whilst not a 'chick flick', there are some romantic moments. There's a little bit of comedy too...I'm not sure if Pearce's and Hardy's performances are deliberately amusing, but apart from that aspect, there are some other amusing moments in the movie. I also liked the singing you first hear when Jack enters a church to be close to a woman he fancies (Australian actress Mia Wasikowska. There is a big Australian contingent in this movie. I did see Noah Taylor in the credits but don't remember seeing him in the movie).Apparently this movie has things in common with Cave's original screenplay for the Australian movie ""The proposition"". I haven't seen that movie but if you like either movie, it might pay to check out the other if you haven't seen it.I could see this movie winning an Oscar for best picture or adapted screenplay.A ripping yarn.",Lawless

This is a well done movie indeed although I felt like it could have been an even better movie at the end.Acting, scenery, general story is all quite good. Well the story is okay. It is not exactly ground breaking but rather a standard bootlegging kind of story. The new deputy is a real asshole to the extent of being somewhat unbelievable. Guy Pearce plays the role well though. That goes for the rest of the main cast as well. It is a well-acted movie.It kind of drags on a bit though. The real action where they finally take on the asshole deputy is not until the very end of the movie. Okay, that is perhaps understandable but until then the movie is quite slow. I would not have minded to see both the older Bondurant brothers being a bit more into the action but instead we mostly follow Jack (Shia LaBeouf) on his various more or less silly escapades and romantic adventures which, not very surprisingly, ends up with him leading previously mentioned asshole deputy right to their illegal booze factorysigh! I am not 100% convinced that you can survive having your throat cut by the way. I think that was rather silly.It is a good movie and of a lot higher quality than most although perhaps not exactly my style of movie and I have to say that I thought the ending, with Forrest blundering into the frozen lake, was rather meh. Still, it is worth 6 out o10 stars but not more as far as I am concerned.",Lawless

112,nickmesafilms,Lawless (2012) - Want Some Moonshine? It's So Bad!,8,10 December 2012,"Receiving mixed to positive reviews after it's release at this year's Cannes Film Festival, ""Lawless"" is a historical prohibition movie that retells the true events, taken place during, you guessed it, the early Prohibition era, of a group of moonshine-selling brothers, called the Bondurant brothers. But when a blood-thirsty deputy starts to follow their illegal trail, hell begins to break loose, and when once started off as a simple Western, ""Lawless"" then turns into a hip and suspenseful gangster flick. With an all-star cast including Tom Hardy, Shia LaBeouf, Jessica Chastain, Jason Clarke, Mia Wasikowska, Gary Oldman, and Guy Pearce, ""Lawless"" is a film with much talent and entertainment that will appeal to those looking for a satisfyingly entertaining gangster film. At a pace of 115-minutes, ""Lawless"" never has a dull moment. It has that ""gangster style"" entertainment that I just love, while at the same time, it's a carefully patient film that takes it's time and keeps your interest. To get a few of my problems out of the way, first, the pacing can be a bit slow at times, causing a few moments of un-interest. While on the other hand, there are so many moments of disbelief that I just couldn't let go of, which sort of loses the realism of the situation. Now, since we got that out of the way, let's discussed what worked the most. The cinematography is absolutely gorgeous, capturing the sights and the feel of a modern-day Western era that looks immaculate on the silver screen. Accompanied by John Hillcoat's flawless directing, the dark tone, and a very realistic mood of Western era, ""Lawless"" is an expertly made film, while keeping me very entertained in this brutal gangster thriller. The shining point of the film is the entire acting ensemble, each delivering one excellent performance after the next. Gary Oldman, although suddenly disappears for most of the film, delivers fine work in his limited amount of screen time. Jessica Chastain also delivers fine work playing Hardy's love interest who has moved to Virginia to live a quieter life. Boy, she chose the wrong place and guy! But, the three stand-out performances came from Hardy, LaBeouf, and Pearce. First off, Tom Hardy has been having one great acting career, and his performance here definitely shows the amount of talent that this guy has, under that ""hard as stone"" look on his face. Delivering more facial expressions than dialouge, Hardy is becoming one of this year's up-and-coming actors of the new century. Shia LaBeouf is starting to make plenty of comeback performances, after his not-so-lucky moments in the last two ""Transformer"" movies. I'm glad that he's finally choosing more edgy and interesting performances that will finally take this young star seriously as an actor. But the stand-out Oscar-worthy performance comes from Guy Pearce, as the psychopathic deputy obsessed with rounding up the Bondurant brothers into custody. I see him as one of the biggest psychos I've ever seen in a movie, and Pearce does a rather impressive job at portraying the blood-thirsty evilness in this unlikely antagonist. This electrifying maniac is what makes this entire movie shine like a glowing star. ""Lawless"" is purely nothing remarkable, but I will intend to see it for a repeat viewing. It's a well-made piece of entertainment that definitely got me on board for the majority of the film. ""Lawless"", in my review, ""intentionally thrilling, suspenseful and entertaining"".",Lawless
113,jcbutthead86,A Great Gangster/Western/Crime Drama. Very Underrated.,10,30 August 2012,"Lawless is a great film that combines three amazing genres of the Gangster Film,Western Film and Crime Drama. Filled with superb direction,great performances and memorable characters Lawless is very underrated.Lawless tells the true(although probably fictionalized)story of the Bondurant brothers Jack Bondurant(Shia LaBeouf)and his older brothers Forrest Bondurant(Tom Hardy)and Howard Bondurant(Jason Clarke) who sell illegal liquor during Prohibition in Franklin County,Virginia during the depression era and having great success. But when a corrupt lawman from Chicago named Charlie Rakes(Guy Pierce) has been brought in as a new special deputy to make life tough for the Bondurants and their business,the Bondurants must band together and put a stop to it.Lawless is a great film from beginning to end that will have you glued to the screen and the reasons the film works so well is because of the way it combines the Gangster and Western film,the portrayal of the Bondurants and brutality of the violence in the film. Lawless is a great movie that wonderfully mixes the Gangster and Western to great effect recreating the 1920's with honesty and truth. With the Gangster side of the film,the characters aren't dressed in suits and glamor and don't have Tommy guns,but deal with the same dangerous situations in Virginia that people dealt with in the big cities in the 1920s and 30s during prohibition. Lawless also subverts the Gangster genre because it isn't a rise and fall film or a dark morality tale,but about a family trying to survive and defend themselves against their enemies and I think that is one of the things that will divide people with Lawless being that Lawless is a Gangster film and that viewers will expect one thing but get something totally different and subversive. Lawless pulls you into a world where back then blood was in the money,alcohol was rough and hard and the only law was a gun. On the Western side the film and most of the characters has a dirty and gritty and you feel the dust in the Virginia town. You don't see any six shooters,horses or Western stagecoaches,but you can feel the tone of the West in this film. Unlike most Gangster films The Bondurants aren't an organized crime family or dangerous local Gangsters,but a family who sell alcohol to make a living and don't want to kill or hurt people unless it has to be done. The Bondurants while living in a gritty and dark world still love each other and have each others backs,sticking together at all costs despite what happens to them. Forrest and Howard don't want Jack in the dark, dangerous business of bootlegging,but Jack is drawn to it and wants money and success. The Bondurants are anti-heroes and like other anti-heroes they're likable and you identify with them because when Charlie Rakes comes into town it makes the Bondurants more likable because Rakes is so corrupt and evil you respect the Bondurants and their actions even more. What I also love about the film is it's dark violence and brutality. Like in John Hillcoat's early film the amazing Western The Proposition,the violence in the film is brutal,bloody and messy whether a person gets punched,stabbed and shot,you as a viewer feel the brutality and harshness of the film's violence that was true to that time period. I'm glad that while Lawless is a big commercial film,Hillcoat brings the same brutality and grit he brought to The Proposition and never tones down the violence for the sake of toning it down or compromising the film. Although Lawless is not an Action film the movie has a few great Action scenes to satisfy Action lovers and the Action is simple but effective. The ending of the film is great because it's violent,vicious but also hopeful and optimistic and is a great cap-off to the film.The acting from the cast is great. Shia LaBeouf is great as Jack Bondurant the youngest of the three Boundurant brothers who wants to prove himself. Tom Hardy is excellent as Forrest Boundurant bringing a gruff and toughness to the character. Jason Clarke does a fantastic job as Howard Boundurant the other older brother. The underrated Guy Pierce is amazing as the villain Charlie Rakes a Corrupt lawman with Pierce bringing a creepy and dangerous vibe to the character. Gary Oldman is great as always in his small role as gangster Floyd Banner. Jessica Chastain is wonderful and sexy as Maggie a woman who leaves Chicago and comes to Frankin County to help the Boundurants and becomes a love interest to Forrest. Mia Wasikowska is fabulous as Bertha a preacher's daughter and Jack's love interest Dane DeHaan does a fine job as Cricket Pete a kid who helps the Boundurants. John Hillcoat's direction in the film is excellent. Hillcoat brings a stylish and gritty look to the film he brought to his other films The Proposition and The Road and keeps the film moving at a great pace. Wonderful direction.The score by Nick Cave and Warren Ellis is excellent and matches the tone ans spirit of the film. Great score.If you love Crime Dramas,Gangster Films,Westerns,or the television show Boardwalk Empire,you'll love Lawless an entertaining tale filled with great direction,acting and story. A very underrated film that is well worth your time. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",Lawless

115,bluesman-20,Outlaws become heroes.,10,9 May 2013,"Lawless follows in the great tradition. That being the story of prohibition or moonshiners denying the government. Robert Mitchum did a great account of it in the 50's with Thunder Road telling of how moonshiners in the 50's dealt with the revenue agents and the mobs. Steve Earle had a great song about it with Copperhead Road which covered three generations of Moonshiners. However Lawless focuses on the roaring 20's and the dirty 30's . And it is there where the greatness of the film shines. For anyone who doesn't know or only knows about Al Capone and Eliot Ness. Prohibition was a huge mistake. One that allowed for criminals to cater to the will of the people and make bootleg beer and whisky or any other kind of booze. In Lawless it focuses on the mountain boys who made a living making moonshine. When the law of the county turned a blind eye to it and let some of the moonshiners make money off of it. It's a harmless agreement no one gets hurt. Then a special Marshall on behalf of the government and a D.A. show up with the power to make lives miserable. All they want is total control of the moonshine operations and the king's share of the profits. Only one family stands up to them the Bondarants. The oldest brother is the kind legends spring up from. He survived WWI after having his entire battalion wiped out around him. Forrest wonderfully played by Tom Hardy is the kind of man who believes in Honor. And He sees the big picture. Middle Brother Howard survived a bout of pneumonia and he's not right in the head. Violence comes easy to him. The youngest brother Jack Played with some gusto by Shia Lebeuof is young and doesn't like violence but he flaunts all of his illegal wealth to woo the girl of his dreams. All of this comes to a head in a violent climax. My only complaint is that Gary Oldman is totally wasted here. His gangster role of Floyd Banner which was written with a lot of power but ultimately wasted for what amounts to a cameo. Oldman's character could have had a lot more to do then what he ends up doing.The film is very much worth your time and it's worth any time you might have in finding the book it's been based on. Not for everybody,but if you have a interest in history and you like to see things as they were. then by all means check it out. You will not be disappointed.",Lawless
116,ragingbull_2005,Lawless could have been a minor gem.,6,20 November 2012,"Lawless is a story of three brothers who are into bootlegging business during the prohibition era. The business is running all smooth. Then new law officers come into the area and demand a cut from the producers. The brothers take a stand and refuse to pay the officers leading to trouble. The first half of the movie, when the elder brother played by Tom Hardy, is running the gang is very absorbing. hardy brings his trademark intensity to his character and there are tense scenes of standoffs between him and Guy Pearce who plays the law officer. However, Hardy is injured and the inept younger brother Labeouf tries to run the gang in the second half. That is when the movie begins to loose its grip. He becomes entangled with the daughter of a preacher and they get slightly longer screen time. LaBeouf is a pathetic actor and here he is unable to redeem himself. Pearce is repelling and effective. Lawless could have been a minor gem. However, after great promise it fizzles out to slightly higher than average fare. 3 out of 5.",Lawless
117,Chris_Pandolfi,Three Brothers in the Moonshine Racket,7,30 August 2012,"""Lawless"" is a triumph of tone and setting, the gritty underworld of prohibition-era Virginia examined with meticulous and sometimes painful detail. This is plainly visible not just in the sets, the costumes, the lighting, the diction, and the rural locations, but also in its depiction of violence, which could arguably put it on the same shelf as the works of Peckinpah, Coppola, Penn, and Scorsese. Director John Hillcoat does not spare the audience the sight of blood or brutality, and although I never lived during that particular time or place, this seems like the most appropriate approach. This isn't to suggest that the violence is glorified or trivialized. There's nothing fun or entertaining about what we see, as it typically would be for an action film or a comic book adaptation; it's quick, merciless, and cruel, as I imagine it must have been all those years ago.The film is adapted from ""The Wettest County in the World,"" a historical novel in which author Matt Bondurant drew inspiration from his own family, specifically his grandfather and two of his great-uncles. They were all actively involved in the illegal moonshine industry of Franklin County, Virginia, which continues to this day despite the fact that Prohibition has long since been repealed. ""If you probe the back cupboards of nearly any house in Franklin County,"" said Bondurant in an essay he wrote regarding his novel, ""or check in the garage fridge back behind that bloody hunk of venison, you will likely find a half-gallon mason jar of clear liquid with some kind of cut fruit suspended in it, most often peaches."" Strange that this side of Franklin County life is considered normal and yet remains publicly unspoken of.With all the work that went into establishing atmosphere, it's disappointing the filmmakers didn't try a little harder with the story or the characters. The latter are all competently cast and performed, and yet there's the unmistakable sense that they were developed purely on preconceived notions. The three Bondurant brothers – Jack (Shia LeBeouf), Forrest (Tom Hardy), and Howard (Jason Clarke) – exist in a gray zone between authentic outlaws and romanticized antiheroes. This is especially true of Forrest, whose misguided belief in his own immortality is unwisely played into by the filmmakers; he survives a number of injuries that would kill most people, including being shot several times and having his throat slit. All the brothers have their roles to play in the moonshine racket, but Forrest is clearly the ringleader, and he has both the brutal survival skills and the fatalistic dialogue to prove it.The main antagonist is Charlie Rakes (Guy Pearce), a special agent from Chicago who's eager to dispense his own brand of justice in Franklin County. There's absolutely no subtlety to this man. He wears expensive form-fitting dress suits, his hands are almost always protected by clean-looking gloves, and his greased black hair is perfectly parted down the center. His arrogance and cruelty, punctuated by relentless displays of physical aggression and repeated bouts of soft giggling, would make even the most hardened criminal blush. There's no question that he's deliciously evil, the kind of villain audiences love to hate. All the same, I'm forced to wonder if such a heightened character is appropriate for a story like this, which is firmly based in reality. He might have been better suited for a more stylized crime thriller, perhaps something along the lines of an adapted graphic novel.There are two female characters, both of whom are underdeveloped, underutilized, and apparently included only out of obligation for a romantic counterpart. This is a shame given the talent bringing them to life. One is Maggie Beauford (Jessica Chastain), a former burlesque dancer from Chicago. Not much is known about her; she claims she wanted to escape the corruption of men like Rakes, and yet she willingly involves herself in the corrupt lives of the Franklin County bootleggers, specifically Forrest, who becomes her love interest. The other is Bertha Minnix (Mia Wasikowska), a preacher's daughter who naturally takes a shine to an outlaw like Jack and teases him with tremendous relish. It's not that he's enticing her into an act of rebellion; it's that she's enticing him into enticing her. Essentially, the two are engaged in a borderline adolescent fling, one that contributes nothing of significance to the overall story.So yes, I had reservations about the approach to character development. But considering how thoroughly the mood was established, I find that I cannot so casually dismiss this film. ""Lawless"" doesn't merely transport us to another time and place, it actually immerses us. We get a sense of geography and social climate. We drink in the rustic architectural details – the rotting wood, the dingy floors, the faded walls – and the period-specific weapons and vehicles. We're genuinely disturbed by the shocking acts of retaliation, such as the repeated use of Tommy guns and brass knuckles, or a man who gets tarred and feathered then propped up on a porch with a sign displaying the word ""bootlegger."" The film doesn't quite have a handle on a narrative, but when it comes to the technical aspects, there's plenty to admire.-- Chris Pandolfi",Lawless
118,eshwarmail,"Not a recommendation but if you chance on it, you may not feel too bored",7,28 November 2012,"Yes, it is another prohibition-era bootleg gang movie. Lots of gun fire, corrupt cops, graphic violence, based on true story stuff and pop-culture references. What works for it are the reliable performances from its dependable cast and what doesn't are its inconsistencies, clichés and a trait dragged too long.Forrest (Tom Hardy), Jack (Shia LaBeouf) and Howard (Jason Clarke) are the Bondurant brothers bootlegging self-distilled liquor in a rural town during prohibition-era. There is a legend in the town which Forrest himself started and believes due to a few past incidents that the Bondurant brothers are invincible and cannot be killed. A corrupt and ruthless official special deputy Charles Rakes (Guy Pearce) arrives from the city with a task force to shutdown bootlegging. Forrest dismisses a brine proposition he is offered by Rakes thus starting a brutal confrontation.It is a movie with an equal number of merits and flaws. Too many or too few of either of them will not give a decent result. Some sequences of strong performances paves way to loud or inexplicable ones. I watched this movie for Jessica Chastain and she plays a rather inconsequential role. The story revolves around Shia LaBeouf's Jack and only this character seems to have some variations and he shows some competence. It is quite a good thread involving Forrest's belief about invincibility, but feels quite dragged by the end. The graphic violence and gore is on par with movies of similar genre and the background score contains some very interesting tracks but the mixing and volume of them at certain moments felt a little off.Not a recommendation but if you chance on it, you may not feel too bored.",Lawless
119,Ryan_MYeah,"A sweeping, powerfully acted, albeit flawed, product.",8,13 December 2012,"John Hillcoat is not one whose career I follow well, and even when The Road got my attention, I ended up not liking it. Lawless may be the start of my fandom, but still an unenthusiastic fandom.Filmed with a script by Nick Cave, Hillcoat makes the most of a lot in this movie. He follows standard conventions when need be, but finds ways to break out of the norm. With his direction, he emphasizes on unflinching, but not over done violence that adds to the story rather than becoming superfluous. On top of that, it's a gorgeous looking movie. The photography, sets, and costumes are all expertly done, and the soundtrack - Much of which was by Cave and his writing partner Warren Ellis - fits in nicely with the tone of the film. Character is what really makes this movie, and that's where Hillcoat puts a lot of investment. He assembles together a game cast, none better than Guy Pearce as the film's snakelike and chilling villain. Shia LaBeouf and Tom Hardy both play their roles very well, LaBeouf being the better of the two. Jessica Chastain does what she can with her small supporting role. I was, however, disappointed that Gary Oldman only gets two scenes. He still owns those two scenes, but I wanted to see more of that character. Though I may like the movie, I will concede that it is still a flawed product. I feel like it held back something, keeping it from being the amazing movie it could have been. There are stumbles throughout, and the climax and resolution is shaky, but Lawless is still worthy of a watch.**** / *****",Lawless

Which ""Lawless"" isn't. What I was really looking forward too though was the cast. And they are what make the film a hard hitting, well acted success.The film is something different too. Its about bootleggers in the early 1930's. When prohibition laws saw alcohol as being illegal. This makes the film about the rivalry and conflicts between the gangs who are making and selling the alcohol. Mainly following Shia LaBeouf (Not as annoying as he ushaully is) as the mild mannered brother off one off the tough gangs.Though not an action movie (which may disappoint those who fell for the trailer) the film is still entertaining enough as a brutally violent drama, with brilliant performances from the usually great Tom Hardy and Guy Pearce, as two rivalling nut cases, almost raising the standard off the film to brilliant.",Lawless
121,nesfilmreviews,"""Lawless"" is surprisingly bland.",6,28 January 2013,"Unlike the last time director John Hillcoat combined forces with screenwriter Nick Cave to make the dark, Australian Western, ""The Proposition,"" their pairing in ""Lawless"" results in a film that is rather bland. ""Lawless"" is well done with fine all around performances, but be forewarned, you've seen this all before. The film boasts a stellar cast and first rate production values, however it's unable to really rise above it's own trappings and contrivances.Set in the waning years of Prohibition in the early 1930s, ""Lawless"" is adapted from the book ""The Wettest County in the World"", in which the real-life bootlegging brothers, the Bondurants, are known as the toughest and most successful bootleggers in the business. Oldest brother Forrest (Tom Hardy) runs the family business with quiet brute and strength, his brother Howard (Jason Clarke) is the crazy one, and then there is the runt of the litter, Jack (Shia LaBeouf).The lucrative business turns bloody when the Bondurants refuse to allow a corrupt politician and his cronies to wedge themselves into their operation. This leads to a violent stand-off between the county's bootleggers and the corrupt police department, lead by Chicago-based federal agent Special Deputy Rakes (Guy Pearce). Rounding out the cast is ex-dancer Maggie (Jessica Chastain), who moves to the countryside to escape the violent ways of the city of Chicago, only to find herself surrounded by similar violence. The storyline feels run-of-mill despite being based on a true story. There really aren't any moments of surprise and shock, as everything unfolds pretty much as expected, all the way up to the very end. Impressive cinematography with outstanding production values don't make up for the fact that their are no real insights into the characters of the true story--just leaving us with relentless carnage. The conclusion is less than satisfying and wraps itself up just a little too neatly. It's a respectable film, but hovers just above mediocrity.",Lawless
122,Tcarts76,Shia LaBeouf is way out of his league...but Tom Hardy makes it worth watching,8,14 November 2012,"""Lawless"" is based on the true story of the Bondurant Brothers, Forrest (Tom Hardy), Howard (Jason Clarke), and Jack (Shia LaBeouf) , a Prohibition era Virginia bootlegging family that finds themselves involved in a violent, bloody feud with a sadistic, crocked State law enforcement official, Charlie Rakes (Guy Pearce). Overall it is a compelling drama based on a book.The Good: Tom Hardy as Forrest, the eldest brother, is the star of this movie. It was a great performance and fully overshadowed the leading role played by LaBeouf. If you have never seen him before watch ""Warrior""(2011). Actually most of the acting was done extremely well and it was a really good all around drama. There was enough blood and gunfire to make it interesting but not to overboard. There was some more in depth studies of the characters that could of made it better, but it was still entertaining.The Bad: Shia LaBeouf was way out of his league with everybody in the film and was out shined by everyone of his fellow cast members. I really question that decision to give him a role where he really didn't fit. There was a couple of story aspects that lacked clear explanations as well, such as a legend of invincibility, or the past of Maggie (Jessica Chastain) a love interest of Forrest'sin the story. Explained, these things would have painted an overall better picture.Overall I give it an 8 of 10. Shia LaBeouf really drags it down along with a few mysteries that need more explaining. I am still shaking my head wondering who made the decision to hire LaBeouf as the lead, as clearly everyone around him are much better actors.Like my review? Hate em?

123,rgblakey,Take a ride with the bootleggers in Lawless,8,29 August 2012,"Mobster movies are a really popular genre, but not only do they not have very many of them come along these days, those that do are not as good as they used to be. The latest film Lawless isn't so much a straight mobster film, but more moonshine runners that have to deal with some aspects of gangsters and the law giving the potential to deliver to the genre that's sorely missed.Lawless follows the true story of the infamous Bondurant brothers who were moon shiners during Prohibition-era in Virginia, whose loyalty are put to the test against the backdrop of the nation's crime wave. This is one of those movies that have a great cast and an interesting story that is based on actual events, but could easily go horribly wrong if not handled properly. Thankfully for the most part, this film works really well. This has all the makings of the gangster film, but set in the backwoods of moonshining delivering something new to the genre. Everyone in the cast do a great job with their characters delivering some good believable performances. Tom Hardy really has been able to step up and be a powerful leading man with the action and the acting. LaBeouf does really well with his varying emotions that his character deals with throughout the film. Gary Oldman was born to play a mobster, but sadly just isn't on screen enough to really give him a chance to do his thing. The real stand out here is Guy Pearce. He delivers a creepy, psychotic performance with a character that is bothersome on numerous levels, from his lack of eyebrow look to his mannerisms. The film is filled with plenty of action that's not watered down like a lot of films today, including a brutal beating that is cringe worthy at times. The only real issue with this film seemed to be some of the pacing. It moves along fine, but at times seemed to jump way ahead in time without setting the transition up.This in no way hurts the film and could have something to do with the editing and missing scenes, but just made some moments feel a bit off. Beyond that, this film probably should have been more average, but thanks to the great cast and heavy action steps this film up to a great addition to the genre.http://www.examiner.com/movie-in-dallas/bobby-blakey",Lawless

127,bayardhiler,Blinded By White Light,9,21 January 2014,"Anyone who reads history knows that the 1920's was a time of economic prosperity as well as a time of corruption, gangs, and murder, all on the account of the ""noble experiment"" that was prohibition. As we all know it was a miserable failure due to the fact that too many people wanted their alcohol, which the gangs were all too willing to supply with the help of the police and politicians who wanted their piece of the pie. Most of us tend to think it was just the big cities that had all the action but as 2012's ""Lawless"" shows, the rural areas could more than match the big cities in terms of crime and brutality. The movie's about three brothers, the Bondurants, who make a living as moonshiners selling the ""white light"" in the back water county of Franklin, Virginia. Forrest, played by Tom Hardy, is the leader while Howard (Jason Clarke) follows his lead in the operation. As for Jack (Shia LeBeouf), he's more or less the Fredo of the bunch since he doesn't have much to do except be the driver of their delivery truck. But all that changes when a corrupt district attorney demands a piece of the family's profits. When they refuse, he unleashes a corrupt and disturbingly ruthless lawman from Chicago on them in the form of Charlie Rakes (Guy Pierce). Now they need to rely on each more than other and whether he likes it or not, Jack has to get his hands dirty. I admit, I wasn't expecting much from Mr. LaBeouf but he's able to play Jack as someone who goes from a coward to would be rural kingpin rather well. He especially shines in his pursuit of preacher's daughter Bertha, who's played with simple perfection by Mia Wasikowska. Tom Hardy also dives in to the role of Forrest, his voice being unrecognizable from his native British one, and with his silent but tough demeanor, we have no doubt that he is one of the last people you want to miss with. But Hardy is able to show us that Forrest has a soft side when he falls in love with former Chicagoan dancer Maggie, played to great seductive effect by Jessica Chastain. Rounding out the brothers cast is Jason Clarke, who's able to play loyal brother Howard with an understated but memorable style. Of course, what would a prohibition movie be if it didn't have a lot of gun fights and car chases and boy do we get it, mostly because of the actions of corrupt lawman Rakes. With his fancy suits and egotistical zeal, Guy Pierce plays Rakes to the hilt as a ruthless, snotty killer who we desperately want to see get his.Congratulations are also in order for writer Nick Cave and director John Hillcoat for being able to capture the mood and setting of a simpler time when bootleggers were kings and lawmen were the enemy, be it in the cities or in the hills of rural America. They also don't hold anything back when it comes to showing the brutal violence of that era, whether it's someone getting shot, stabbed, punched by brass knuckles, or for one poor fellow, being tarred and feathered. And if you happen to be a lover of beautiful 1920's cars like me, then you're in for a real treat here as we see plenty of them when the money starts rolling in for our heroes. Admittedly ""Lawless"" is just a tad bit slow at first but once it gets going, it never stops. Besides, it's always nice to get to know the characters before the action starts, isn't it? It's the type of movie that you wish Hollywood made more often but sadly just doesn't. So, even if you're disgusted of what modern cinema has become, don't hesitate to check this rare, modern good flick out. Also starring Gary Oldman as big city gangster Banner and Dane DeHann as loyal helper Cricket.",Lawless
128,dougandwin,A bit too far-fetched,6,14 October 2012,"Claiming to be a true story is a bit too much. but that aside it is a film that does grip...but not entertain, due to the unbridled violence that runs for two hours without let-up. Outstanding in the cast is Guy Pearce (goes from strength to strength in the acting stakes), and Tom Hardy (who sounds like Paul Newman a hell of a lot). There are some scenes that could well have been edited out due to their content, but the scenery is superb, and quite surprisingly the music fits the mood very well. I found the lead LeBoeuf to be struggling in a part that required greater ability, and the addition of Gary Oldman had to be to give star value, but frankly he is wasted. The final scenes beg more questions than answers, and I have to say Forrest must have had the constitution of 10 men. Frankly, it could have been better with a few better actors to do the leads justice (Hardy and Pearce excepted)",Lawless
129,WubsTheFadger,Lawless,7,23 February 2018,"Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadgerFirst off, the story is extremely interesting and genuine due to the use of practical and historically accurate props and sets. The story starts off very strong but loses a lot of power in the middle. The ending is very good though.The acting is all around very good. Jason Clarke, Gary Oldman, Mia Wasikowska, Jessica Chastain, and Dane DeHaan perform well. Tom Hardy steals the show with a stunning and powerful performance. Shia LaBeouf performs okay. I just can't take him seriously with his childish face trying to act tough. Guy Pearce, who is usually an amazing actor, does an okay job at portraying the villain.The pacing is very good in the beginning and towards the end but it slows down in the middle. The runtime is also overlong.The film has humor, a great use of violence, and some interesting characters.Pro: Interesting story and characters, good acting, an amazing performance by Tom Hardy, a great ending, some fast pacing in the beginning and end, and seeing Jessica Chastain nakedCons: Poor performance by Shia LaBeouf and Guy Pearce, slow pacing during the second act, and an overlong runtime",Lawless
130,daniellawson-14-787057,"All surface, no depth",5,27 May 2020,"POSITIVES:1) Amongst this A list cast, the best performance by far and away is Dane DeHaan. Also, his death is the only moment of depth and emotion in the entire film
2) The dynamic of the three Bondurant brothers working together despite having 3 very different personalities is a good dynamic that works well; although it is clearly ripped off from GoodfellasNEGATIVES:1) Guy Pierce and Gary Oldman must have needed dental surgery after all the time they spend chewing the scenery in this film
2) The two romances in the film are both completely pointless
3) Tom Hardy should have died when his throat was slit, it would have been more realistic and would have added more depth and emotion to the film
4) As I said earlier, the three brothers are a complete rip off from Goodfellas. Shia Labeouf is the young one that wants money and glory, AKA Ray Liotta; Jason Clarke is the violent and unstable one, AKA Joe Pesci; and Tom Hardy is the real leader of the group, AKA Robert De Niro
5) Jessica Chastain looks like she just wandered onto the set of the film. She's wearing a full face of makeup in every scene she's in and her clothes all look like modern day clothes while everyone else is dressed like it's the 1930s
6) The tone of the film is all over the place. This is epitomised by the score, containing cinematic orchestra music mixed with modern country songs
7) The direction is incredibly bland. There are no long takes or wide shots or anything that would make the direction stand out at all",Lawless
131,CMTiago,Gritty story with stellar performances,7,8 August 2014,"Lawless is on the surface, a crime drama that exposes a story of values and a time in which every man had to fight to acquire what he wanted. Ste during the Prohibition Era, the Bondurant brothers (Forrest,Howard & Jack) run a successful bootlegging business in rural Virginia. When the federal government decides to take action they send Special Deputy Charley Rakes to terminate the activity. From there all out war will erupt with both sides attempting to outsmart the other. Also considered a gangster film, Lawless is still a good movie with pretty much stellar performances from every cast member. The look of the film is one of gloom, but also hope, with the everlasting themes of love and loyalty always overseeing the character's decisions and motivations. Overall I would classify this movie as a worthwhile movie experience. It neither deviates too much into the love it part, but is also far from being hated.Rating: 7,5/10",Lawless
132,jaxbubba,Just Plain Nonsense......,3,3 December 2012,"Not being a huge Shia LaBeouf fan did not help sway my opinion of this very slow moving, quite tiresome, highly lackluster prohibition era film. Based on the historical novel 'The Wettest County in the World' by Matt Bondurant, the film follows the bootlegging exploits of the Bondurant brothers in Franklin County, Virginia circa 1930. However, instead of giving us all the exciting adventures of running moonshine during one of America's most corrupted eras of all times, director John Hillcoat (The Road) decides to focus most of his attention on the youngest Bondurant brother, Jack (LaBeouf) and his infatuation of a young Mennonite girl, Bertha (Mia Wasikowska). The most prominent Bondurant brother is Forrest Bondurant (played by Tom Hardy). Forrest is stubborn, forceful, and non-negotiable. When a newly appointed Special Deputy Charley Rakes (Guy Pearce) decides to muscle in on the local bootlegging community and demands retribution in order to continue their moon-shining operations, Forrest is adamantly defiant. A gauntlet is issued, and a war started.Again, this is what the movie should have concentrated all its efforts on. This is what the audience was most interested in seeing. However, instead we are relegated to some discombobulated images and scenes in which Rakes takes adverse actions against anonymous individuals, when the person that he truly detests, Forrest, remains mostly untouched at his local establishment in which he runs and lives. To add insult to injury, Tom Hardy decided to use a muddled, warbled dialect when he speaks, which is extremely difficult to hear much less understand. Another incredible actor, Gary Oldman, is added to mix as Floyd Banner. Banner is a notorious Chicago gangster, who decides to buy the Bondurant moonshine. The issue here is that the Banner character is only seen on screen twice throughout the whole film. Does anyone else think that a film about bootlegging might be just a bit more interesting if it focused on the moving, shipping, and enterprising of the moonshine being made, bought, sold, sought, found, destroyed, etc.? The only thing interesting in a film regarding moon-shining, are the extremes to which the moonshiner will go in order to continue his moon-shining endeavors. At one point in this film, Jack (LaBeouf) makes a statement that the Bondurant's stills were brewing 1,000 gallons of liquor a week. That's a lot of liquor moving from Virginia to Chicago, a lot of product (sugar, potatoes, etc,) being bought and consumed, and would have had to have more than just four individuals working this enterprise none of which is addressed to audience!!! I cannot recommend this film. It's pure drivel. You have possibly one of the most interesting story lines / plot at your disposal: police corruption vs small town moonshiner who turns into a big time liquor distributor. However, the story that director John Hillcoat opts to tell are more centered on the women in these men lives. I just do not understand nor do I understand why!!! It's definitely not worth enduring the 116 minutes of running time.See more of my reviews on FB @ ""the Faris Reel""",Lawless
133,Sankari_Suomi,Please hit Shia LaBeouf in the face again... but harder this time,7,8 June 2019,"Controversial screenwriter Nick H. Cave serves up a gritty backwoods drama adapted from Matt Bondurant's novel based on events that didn't happen.The film is carried by Tom Hardy, Guy Pearce, and a sadly underutilised Gary Oldman.

134,dharmendrasingh,'We control the fear',7,6 September 2012,"Franklin County, Virginia, 1931. A time of corrupt cops and opportunistic outlaws. A time of bootlegging. No surprise it was dubbed 'the wettest county in the world'. In this gangster's paradise, knuckleduster-enthusiast Forrest Bondurant (Tom Hardy) leads his two loyal brothers, Jack and Howard (Shia LaBeouf and Jason Clarke), in sustaining their moonshine racket. Their refusal to pay backhanders, much less cease bootlegging, prompts the appearance of Guy Pearce's Charlie Rakes, not so much an upstate lawman as a sadistic monster, whose very face is a contortion of hate. Pearce delivers a performance so good, it threatens to overtake the plot. Rakes pursues the brothers as they go from being big small-timers to small big-timers. Stopping them is his raison d'etre, but Bondurants 'don't lay down for nobody', and this deadlock allows for some horrific violence. Sadly, though, the mounting tension leads only to a standard stand-off. Hardy affects an accurate drawl, but I didn't quite believe his scowling or physicality as I did with his Bane, not even when he promptly recovers from having his throat cut from ear to ear. Gary Oldman's Tommy Gun-wielding outlaw, Floyd Banner, is instrumental in assisting the Bondurants, but is given far too little screen time to be a presence.Jessica Chastain has nothing much to do as the brothers' moll, Maggie, other than look pretty, which she does magnificently well. Eventually she seduces Forrest, who prefers sleeping with guns than with girls. The ever-charismatic Shia LaBeouf is the civilised one, meaning he's the coward. He's more interested in courting the preacher's daughter, a clean-faced beauty called Bertha (Mia Wasikowska). That he receives top billing says much about him. Aussie director John Hillcoat's earlier credits include gritty Western, 'The Proposition' and the even grittier post-apocalypse drama, 'The Road'. His painterly films are infused with brightness and colour; fitting for a former canvass painter. Film factotum Nick Cave composed the soundtrack and wrote the screenplay, which he based on the book by Jack Bondurant's grandson, Matt. Apparently Cave agonised over which bits to include. I would have paid less attention to the fairytale wistfulness in Jack's narration and – I never thought I'd say this – gone all out on the violence because that's what this story is really about. www.moseleyb13.com",Lawless
135,JimmyCollins,A pretty damn fine movie.,7,2 November 2012,"A movie with a cast as great as this was bound to be excellent, it's not often a cast as impressive as this is compiled into the one film, I mean come in you've got a bevy of some of the greatest actors working today, Tom Hardy Guy Pearce Jessica Chastain Mia Wasikowska, are all actors at the top of the talent pool, and their performances are without a doubt excellent. I will single out Guy Pearce, it's not an easy feat to outshine the likes of Tom Hardy, but Mr Pearce is the real scene stealer in this movie. Appearance wise he's almost unrecognizable and the role itself is something in its own, a villain to really be afraid of, a true psychopath, I think he's way overdue for an Oscar nom and I hope he gets it with Lawless. As I said before the performances from everyone are good, nothing's over done, very understated and done perfectly.The movie is quite interesting, generally it's not the type of film I would rush out to see but pretty much straight away I was intrigued and interested and actually cared about where the story went, the history of illegal alcohol selling in the U.S at the time was something I knew nothing about but the film presents it in a simple way for even dummies like me to understand. It's great to see a tough guy gangster shoot em up style film with a soft side, the inclusion of the female characters really brings another dimension to the male characters that you usually don't see in films such as this.Be warned though, the violence is pretty intense, the throat slitting scene had me on edge and the pretty much any scene Guy Pearce is in will have you shivering. This really is a film any type of film lover will enjoy, be it male or female, young or old, it's got a great story and even greater actors to tell the story.I hope you enjoy it. :)",Lawless
136,tbmforclasstsar,"full of strong acting performances, the wandering plot and thrills of Lawless just keep it from being great",6,18 September 2012,"The prohibition era of America is something that has recently come back as a somewhat significant movement in pop culture. With the success of the HBO series Boardwalk Empire and several feature films made int he era, there is a great deal to watch if you are a fan of that genre of entertainment. And for many, it is very exciting. With crooked cops, illegal alcohol, mobs, tommy guns, classy suits, and old timer cars, the prohibition era is also full of some of the coolest visual motifs in pop culture. It makes sense that a film like Lawless would be something audiences would be interested in seeing. However, even with the setting, costumes, and story being of the prohibition period, it seems to be missing the true feel of the time.Lawless follows the story of three brothers, Jack (Shia LaBeouf), Forrest (Tom Hardy), and Howard Bondurant (Jason Clarke), living in Virginia who work making and selling moonshine from their stills in the hills of the countryside. With prohibition taking full force in America, the brothers are soon met by the authority figure of Charlie Rakes (Guy Pearce), a special agent that has a truly dark side of his own. With the law breathing down there neck, the presence of a mobster named Floyd Banner (Gary Oldman), and a hard-headedness that can only be found in these Virginia three, the brothers are forced to fight for their business and the success they have gained from years of brewing moonshine.First off, I will say that Lawless is incredibly acted, except for one glaring mistake. I hate to keep hating not his guy, but Shia LaBeouf is incredibly miscasted in this film. Where Hardy, Pearce, Clarke, Oldman, and the female lead Jessica Chastain bring incredible characters to life on the screen, LaBeouf is very flat in the role of Jack. Even when the stakes are at their lowest, LaBeouf seems incredibly fake in his portrayal. The best way I can describe it is he is acting how he thinks a good actor would act. Not bringing true emotion to the character, but more of what he has seen other actors do.And this truly is a shame, because the rest of the cast, namely Hardy and Pearce, are fantastic in this film. Tom Hardy is already becoming one of my favorite actors int he business with strong portrayals in almost everything he does. Forrest Bondurant is no exception. Hardy is quietly powerful in every move he makes and word he speaks, a brilliant counter to his enemy in the film, the loud, overconfident Charlie Rakes.To read the rest of the review (IMDb form too short) visit: http://custodianfilmcritic.com/lawless/",Lawless

The other pairs were either depressing or confusing. I read that Shia Labeouf became a method actor and drank moonshine on set, and I guess that's cool, but there were a few times where the drink got the better of him (see: church scene). Tom Hardy was awesome, though this is his second role in a row in which he is hard to understand. I just now realized that Cricket is played by the lead actor in ""Chronicle"" and this is the best news I've heard in a long time. And Mia Wasikowska is pretty as always.But this movie tried to be scary, mainly through Forrest's throat-slashing and Cricket's death, not to mention the opening shootout. The point of this movie is not supposed to be to scare, it should be to educate and more-so entertain. I think (or at least hope) that everyone knows that bootlegging is a dangerous profession.

138,rusoviet,Anytime anywhere Gary Oldham is in a film it truly warrants a.....,5,15 July 2013,"....'check it out!' Regrettably he isn't in it very much although Tom Hardy playing Forrest Bondurant does a solid job. The problem with this film is that it seemed low budget from the get go understandably it is in rural VA but even allowing for the isolated location it still was lacking in a compelling scenes to fill in the 'de rigeur' (romance, betrayal, ambush, illicit sex, banjo music a twanging, et. al.).The most telling lack of continued inability to make a connection for any serious film goer is Shia LeBoeuf - the guy reminds one of Bobbie Redford - picks good scripts but the acting sucks.I viewed this from Redbox which I assume is where 99% of all found this film - Oldham got his scratch up front - this went straight to DVD.",Lawless
139,littlemartinarocena,Less Than Lawless,3,1 September 2012,"Wanting to be so many things, sometimes, leaves you with very little. ""Lawless"" is a blatant example of that. Everything feels so unauthentic no matter how much effort has been put into accomplishing the opposite. The script is rambling and sketchy as well as starchy and, at times, downright annoying. Tom Hardy is one of my favorites of late, but here, he seems to be impersonating someone. It felt like a self-conscious parody. And Shia LaBeouf? What's with this man? Why is he playing leads in films? He, I'm sure, must have acting coaches and he is, clearly, following instructions, but what about the truth? He acts up a storm but there is not a moment of truth, not one. Look at the moment when he's told his friend Cricket has been killed. I felt embarrassed for him. Jessica Chastain's character suffers a radical change in the middle of the story and I kept wondering, how? when? and more importantly, why? Gary Oldman is always a pleasure to watch and Mia Wasikowska is lovely and does the most with the little she was given. The lack of chemistry between her and LaBeouf is unavoidable. He is acting all the time. The only highlight, really, is Guy Pearce. His performance is fearless and enormously entertaining.",Lawless

141,rebecca-ry,Something's went wrong,8,11 September 2012,"'Lawless' is definitely a great film but there's something missing. The acting is really strong; Tom Hardy's performance is probably his best so far. His voice is so different to his normal voice which really highlights how he has worked hard on his performance. I was really surprised by Shia LaBeouf's performance, he's never really impressed me but he gave a great performance here. He really proved that he could do some proper acting in the future and hopefully move away from the 'Transformers' series. Mia Wasikowska and Jessica Chastain both perform well but their roles are wasted here. They have no real purpose in the film and are merely there as love interests. It wouldn't have been such an issue if they had gotten any actress for these roles but they instead chose two of the best rising stars with huge amounts of talent. Guy Pierce is outstanding here but his role becomes almost comical towards the end. He gives a great performance though and is quite disturbing. Gary Oldman gives a really good performance but has only 5 minutes screen time! It seems like such a waste, it would have been interesting to see his character included in the plot a lot more.Overall this film was fantastic but there was a few things that director John Hillcoat could have improved that would have made this film truly brilliant, such as giving more characters some crucial screen time. The violence was not really an issue; I don't think it diverted the film away from anything which is good.

Unless you can't handle violence and nudity because there is quite a bit of it in this film.First of all, I am not into Western films. I enjoyed this film a lot more than ""The Dark Knight Rises"" (I know they are not the same type of film, but I'm just basing it on overall movie experience). I don't care for The Avengers (I did see it in theaters, and it bored me. I could not wait for it to end). There isn't that many films these days that make me want to go out and have to see it in theaters -- and feel satisfied for paying to see it... Well, Lawless was an exception.Guy Pearce, Tom Hardy, Gary Oldman... wow.The tension and performances from the actors kept me engaged through the entire film.The story is very simple, the ending is a bit comical, but the cast selection and the performances from everyone is just top notch.It had a similar tension/drama to Clint Eastwood's 1992 Oscar film ""Unforgiven""; I enjoyed that film too, and I don't even have interest in Western movies. It's not just a shoot-them-up violence, but it has emotion to the film. Guy Pearce, as Charlie Rakes, the new sheriff in town, is definitely Oscar-worthy performance. He is definitely going to be included in one of the most memorable villains in cinema.I did wish Gary Oldman, as the legendary gangster Floyd Banner, had more screen time. He was a major ""badass"" in this film, but definitely would have loved to see him included in the story more; that was a bit of a letdown.Shia LaBeouf was also fantastic giving the film a lighter feel and comic relief, casted just right as the timid, yet trying to be a hotshot boy.Jason Clarke, Jessica Chastain, Mia Wasikowska, Dane DeHaan also had the right image for their part and great performances.

145,petit76,a great movie by an Australian Director,7,27 August 2012,"First off Lawless is one of the rarest movies ever depicting the Prohibition era of the United States dating back to 1920's. I am very impressed with the study of that era in this movie. Contrary to what many American directors have pulled off regarding this era the Australian director has exceeded many movie avids' expectations with this gritty movie. The only downside was I would want to see Gary Oldman to have more moments than what he was given for him . In cast wise I can tell that it is not stellar but still not fading away. I would want to see Jeff Bridges to have a casting in this superb movie.Many movies which told stories of the past eras did not really weave the sociological impacts and influences of those times but the director and the photography artist must have studied hard before drawing the outline of this movie.Nothing falls short of the history. As a very anal person I am I paid a close attention to see any discrepancies but I was caught off-guard with the homework of the director and whoever was involved in the study of the history of that time . The scenery and the dialogues were meticulously intertwined and nothing falls short in cinematography. Bootleggers rise up against the authorities who entreat the profit in importunity. I liked the acting of Shia Lebouf. He was lost in Transformers but he found his incarnation in this movie. His talents and acting skills reminded me of Ed Norton and I believe he will carve his name in the movie chronicles more than what Norton did so far. I gave this movie the benefit of the doubt however it was up to par.Evren Buyruk, Tx USA.",Lawless

147,J_Trex,Interesting Appalachian Bootlegging Tale,8,4 September 2012,"This was an interesting drama about the bootlegging culture of Franklin County, VA circa 1932. It was compelling the way bootlegging moonshine was such a mainstream activity in that area. Nearly everybody with the means and the desire could run a still. Sell the stuff to the local mobsters, who trucked it into the market place. It was also an interesting contrast between good and evil. The bootleggers were the good guys. The G-man was the epitome of evil.The main star was Shia LeBeouf as the narrator, the youngest brother of the Bondurant clan, longtime residents of the area who turned to bootlegging during prohibition. He basically helped out his older brothers, tending to the bootlegging business, working the production and distribution of the moonshine. His older brothers were played by Tom Hardy (Forris Bondurant), the muscle of the family, and Jason Clarke (Howard Bondurant). Hardy and Clarke are both British, but you could never tell from their accents.Guy Pearce played the wicked and no good G-man, out to get his fair share of the loot, rather that protect citizens from the evils of liquor.Maybe in some backhanded sort of way, this movie is a call to legalize drugs. The laws do far more damage and corruption to society than the product.",Lawless
148,tgooderson,Well acted and Beautiful,8,9 September 2012,"Lawless is a prohibition era gangster biopic about three brothers from Virginia. Jack Bondurant (Shia LaBeouf) is the youngest of the brothers and lacks the courage, strength or attitude to violence that his older brothers Forrest (Tom Hardy) and Howard (Jason Clark) possess. Forrest especially is a sort of Clint Eastwood figure; strong, silent and deadly. All three are involved in the moonshine business but their trade comes under threat when a new Special Deputy (Guy Pearce) arrives from Chicago to put a halt to their operations.The film shares traits with Director John Hillcoat's previous film The Proposition. Both focus on men outside the law in semi-desolate locations who must battle across a thin line between right and wrong against corrupt officials. The beautiful but run down locations also help bring to mind Hillcoat's The Road. This film though is more of a coming of age story as young Jack Bondurant fights for respect from his brothers and the gangster who inhabit his world. It is also a tale that blurs the lines between good and evil, right and wrong with the Bondurant boys becoming anti heroes who the audience will be routing for from start to finish.The great strength of Lawless is its beauty. The film is stunning to look and you never for one minute think that you aren't in depression hit, rural Virginia. The sets are dressed to pinpoint perfection and the costumes look lived in. The cinematography too is beautiful and this really helps to act as a counterweight to another side of the film – its gruesome violence. At times this is an uncomfortable film to watch. The violence is reminiscent of Drive in that it sometimes comes out of the blue but often you are aware that you are being led towards it but are still stunned when it arrives. The film features beatings, stabbings, shootings and slitting of throats but it never feels gratuitous. You always get the sense that it is vital to the story. Something which isn't so vital to the storytelling but is delightful nonetheless is the sight of Jessica Chastain naked (well topless anyway). Some people (not me of course) might say that is worth the price of admission alone.As well as a great amount of violence, the film also has several moments of great comedy. In the packed screening I was in there was one huge laugh and at least five or six chuckles from the large audience. A lot of the humour comes from Tom Hardy's violent but understated and confused ex-soldier character and the legend that the brothers are immortal. We learn early on that he was the only survivor of his company during the Great War and his traumatic past is clear to see in his character and performance. Hardy is once again the standout actor, something which I'm getting used to writing these days. His grunts, menace and confused looks with regard to Chastain's character made the film for me and his performance in general helped me to decide on the higher grade when I couldn't decided between of two different marks out of ten. Shia LaBeouf also helps to wash away the memories of the Transformers movies with a solid and mature performance and third brother Jason Clark plays the drunken brute well. Another great performance comes from Guy Pearce whose hair, speech and mannerisms seem to come from another world. Jessica Chastain and Mia Wasikowska unfortunately suffer a little from lacklustre female characters as neither have an awful lot to do. Neither leaves the production having tarnished their reputations though. Gary Oldman is excellent but his role is very small. Nick Cave's score works very well with the visuals and ads to the prohibition-hillbilly feel of the film.I was never bored while watching Lawless and it looked great and was wonderfully acted by Hardy in particular, but it sometimes feels as though there are too many characters vying for too little screen time. I would also have preferred for the focus of the story to have been with Hardy's character instead of LaBeouf's as his arc was more interesting to me. Even so, Lawless is definitely an above average gangster flick and hits the mark with its dramatic and sometimes comedic and violent tone.www.attheback.blogspot.com",Lawless
149,Rat_27,What exactly was the point?,5,26 November 2012,"This movie makes as much of an impact as the passing of Forrest. It's almost incidental. Shia Lebeouf is at his best, which means ... tragic. The scene when he learns his friend has been killed is an example of how NOT to be taken seriously as an actor. This movie could have been interesting, but it just wasn't. The plot is convoluted, the acting ranges from passable to just plan horrible. The writing is mediocre. The character interaction and development leaves a lot to be desired. ... I will never watch this movie again, and I deleted it three hours after I downloaded it. If you have a couple of hours to kill and nothing better to do, then watch this movie. However, you might want to just wash your hair, vacuum the sofa, or wash your car. Maybe clip coupons.

152,octopusluke,"So much testosterone, yet this John Hillcoat / Nick Cave gangster drama lacks boldness and balls.",6,26 November 2012,"Following on from the disappointing avant-garde prison allegory Ghosts of the Civil Dead, the frolicking Aussie crime drama The Proposition, and the bleak, hollow adaptation of Cormac MacCarthy's The Road, Australian filmmaker John Hillcoat returns with this robust, machismo gangster drama.Teaming up once again with musician, author, and sometime screenplay writer Nick Cave, Lawless is the adaptation of historical novel The Wettest County in the World, by Matt Bondurant. Full of crime, violence and misogyny, it's a morality tale centring around three Bad Seeds.Shia LaBeouf stars as Jack Bondurant, the youngest of three bootlegging brothers who supply the inhabitants of Franklin County, Virginia, with illegal liquor known as moonshine during Prohibition. An aggravated teenager going into adulthood, Jack is the heart and the soul of the movie, whilst the perpetually intoxicated middle brother Howard, and the grunting, patriarchal elder son Forest (Jason Clarke and Tom Hardy, respectively) provide the brain and brawn. Whilst affable local mobster Floyd Banner (Gary Oldman) patrols the city streets, a dandified Chicagoan law enforcer steps in as a new predator on the Bondurant's turf, who does everything in his power – lawful, or otherwise – to destroy the family business.A nuevo Western (it's set in the East, for a start), the token love interests come in the form of Bertha (Mia Wasikowska), the coy daughter of an Amish preacher after Jack's heart. More interestingly, red haired damsel in distress Maggie (the bewitching Jessica Chastain) stumbles into the county wanting to forget the dancing days she left behind in town and ends up striking a sensual nerve with the diffident Forrest.Although Hillcoat and Cave never commit to any stylistic form, they dabble with the world's of Clint Eastwood westerns and Charles Bronson's Death Wish. Much like the source material by Jack's grandson, Lawless resolutely pardons, even eulogises the Bondurants' barbaric behaviour. Using the clichés of community philanthropy – and a young cripple called Cricket (Dane DeHaan) – to make the three hillbillies look like tobacco chewing, white whiskey slurring Robin Hoods. Not that the film should have a validated ethical judgement, but the lack of one – plus the subordinated female stock characters – make for stinted viewing.As is often the case with Hillcoat's work, Lawless has some fantastic aspects, but fails to gel together to make one brilliant film. It's highlights come first and foremost from the performances, most notably the restrained, stoic performance from Tom ""The Cardy"" Hardy as the paternal older brother Forrest, Shia LaBeouf showing great thespian depth as the younger brother in the shadows Jack, and Guy Pearce's camped-up turn as insipid city cop Charlie Rakes brilliantly personifies Nick Cave's run-in with American murderer Stagger Lee.Elsewhere, there's the footstomping soundtrack made up of bluegrass renditions of classic rock songs such as Captain Beefheart's 'Sure 'Nuff Yes I Do' and The Velvet Underground's 'White Light/White Heat', performed here by Nick Cave, his frequent collaborator Warren Ellis and country legend Ralph Stanley, under the apropos moniker The Bootleggers. In the wings, there's the beautiful hot-rod Ford motorcars, the luscious, gritty cinematography of Benoît Delhomme and the excellent period costume design from frequent Hillcoat collaborator Margot Wilson (if the movie gets any Oscar nods, it'll be for this).All that said, there's something that just doesn't quite work in this prohibition gangster flick. It's just not audacious enough for it's shifty storyline to work. In essence, it's the tame, polished mainstream version of The Proposition, only worse. Lawless doesn't have the testosterone, nor the balls to be a truly great film.More reviews at http://www.366movies.com",Lawless
153,lekgolah,Tom Hardy shines again with another great performance.,8,10 September 2012,"Sometimes when you see a director's name on a new film, you imagine it to be like their previous work. In this case I was expecting The Road or something on that level but with prohibition instead of an apocalypse, so it made for a refreshing change to see that John Hillcoat has taken a different direction in his new film with a lighter(ish) atmosphere. The screening I was in had the audience laughing at the jokes and cringing at the violence, which combined with a well-told (if well trodden) story, made for an enjoyable viewing experience. While the story of the film may appeal to fans of that era, it is the cast which will likely be the reason why people will come to see this film. It boasts a good list of names and are all brilliant. Tom Hardy brings out another terrific performance as Forrest, the middle brother, Shia LaBeouf gives what could be his strongest performance yet as the youngest and Jason Clarke as the oldest brother is great but doesn't get the screen time, which is a shame since he brought his character to life with such energy, I wanted to know more about him. Speaking of screen time, much has been said about Gary Oldman and while it is true that is only in the film for no more than three scenes roughly, he does a great job, showing his dedication to even the smallest of roles. Guy Pearce stars as the city police officer who shakes things up from the moment he arrives on screen, and while his performance does veer on the comic, almost belonging to another film entirely, he is fantastic to watch and gives energy to the film. With such a strong male cast, Jessica Chastain manages to hold her own and bounces off Tom Hardy's character well. Even the smaller performances of Mia Wasikowska and Dean DeHann impress. Although LaBeouf's and Wasikowska's relationship needed more time to truly develop. My only major complaint about the film is the pacing and movement from scene to scene. After once particular scene, the film just cuts to black similar to a TV programme when on a cliffhanger. In one scene a character has bruises and in the next he doesn't, one scene looks like a hot day in Virginia, in the next it is snowing and then it isn't. Some indication into the time would have helped the film but that is only a minor complaint.Ultimately it's the performances that make the film. While it may not be entirely original, it is certainly entertaining. Hardy's performance shows that he is well on his way to becoming one of cinema's greatest.",Lawless
154,plpregent,Typical example of flawed pacing,5,18 September 2012,"While Lawless is what one could call ""decent romanticized entertainment"", it is an underachievement considering the talent that was employed here.To summarize, this film is about a trio (more like a pair, anyways) of bootlegging countrymen(Hardy Clarke, and LeBaouf playing the Bondurant brothers) during the prohibition, and their struggle against an guns-blazing invader from Chicago (Guy Pierce), who wants to stick his nose into their little business. While the premise was attractive to me, the delivery suffered from several problems.I'll say it right off the bat : I have no issues with films dealing with likable-to-the-masses characters or with mainstream entertainment. But the line between a typical successfully achieved Hollywood product and an overly-romanticized, clichéd piece of forgettable entertainment can be thin, and the difference lies in the overall execution. Lawless deploys some talent in the acting department, some polished visuals, and an interesting subject.However, it spends so much length in clumsy and clichéd subplots to that it ends up losing its focus and lacks any sense of urgency or pace whatsoever. It does offer some interesting scenes, and there are a few moments of bloodshed and significant action, but every time you think the pace is about to finally kick off, the next scene sends you straight back to Snoozeworld and its land of bland, clumsily-paced subplots. I understand that this is not an action film, but never does the pace actually gets the audience significantly involved in the story that's unfolding. And that is a major issue.Another issue was the music, which basically became an editing tool here. When the music starts, that's a cue for the next scene. By the end, riding along with all the clichéd subplots, it does make the film quite predictable and does not improve the overall experience.In terms of performances, Lawless delivers. LeBaouf seems to get a lot of hate from the Online community, and I have no idea why. He does a pretty decent job here. Tom Hardy is good as well, while I've seen him play much more interesting characters. At times, it almost becomes a joke listening to him moan and groan all the time. Chastain was good as well. I was highly disappointed with Gary Oldman, who does have a few intense moments, but plays a completely underused character. This is more of a cameo than an actual role, as he has about two or three minutes of screen time. Guy Pierce is barely recognizable, and is effective as the evil, annoying townsman.Visually, the photography and direction are, all in all, pretty well executed. This will not go down in history, but the visuals, costumes, and camera-work do provide the viewer with a certain immersion, while the overall pacing problems kind of play against it. It's a loop of ""action, brake, subplot, minor character development""...at the end of the day, even if it looks pretty, the sparks never get strong enough to make a fire out of it, and no real energy or suspense ever emerge.I would be surprised if they still hold a copy of this film at your local video store in a year and a half/two years. But hey, that's just another Hollywood underachievement that could have been so much more, but fell victim to the traps of its own recipe.While one can't say that Lawless is a bad film, it is simply nothing special.",Lawless

Their new riches bring them into the eye line of crooked federal agent Charlie Rakes played by the appalling Guy Pearce who is pretty much a pantomime villain with a ridiculous look. Unfortunately for the viewers the beautiful Jessica Chastain and Mia Wasikowska don't get enough screen time, they are the snippets of eye candy we get every so often.The film is full of gruesome violence, however that is not to say that the violence over shadows the excellence of the script which was adapted by Nick Cave whose previous screenplays include ""The Proposition"" & ""Ghost...

162,knowyourmovie,A rare colorful oasis in the depressing gray wasteland of the modern cinema,8,11 September 2012,"Movies honestly attempting to tell a simple but touching story that reflects real life in all its complexity look like rare colorful oases in the depressing gray wasteland of the modern cinema. Movies like ""Lawless"" or David Lynch's ""The Straight Story"" manage to keep it all natural without adding any artificial ingredients: forced fake plot devices, made-up motivations, oversimplifications, oversophistications, perplexing experimentations and so forth.The quite well written by Nick Cave (""The Proposition"") screenplay for the film is based on ""The Wettest County in the World"" – a 2008 historical novel that in turn is based on a true story. Moreover, MattBondurant, the author of the novel, happens to be a grandchild of Jack Bondurant, one of the story's main characters.Everyone directly or indirectly involved in creating ""Lawless"" – from Matt Bodurant to Nick Cave to the visionary director John Hillcoat ( ""The Proposition"", The Road) seemed to treat the source material thoughtfully and carefully. Due to their commendable diligence ""Lawless"" did not become one of those numerous fake ""based on true story"" movies notorious for their famously nasty artificial aftertaste.""Lawless"" is not trying to analyze, explain, convince, or entertain at all costs. It does not take sides and does not have any explicit or hidden agenda, whether noble or sinister. It just masterfully tells a simple story. Despite being set relatively far in the past, the movie still manages to be relevant, engaging, touching, and thought provoking because of its strong, full-blooded connection with the real life.Some reviewers would vehemently disagree with that. They would argue that the movie lacks cohesion and authenticity because of the way it intricately combines the lyric, almost unbelievably idyllic scenes full of poetic tenderness with the sequences of the equally unbelievable excessively grotesque violence. The truth is that such is life: mysterious, unpredictable, at times shocking, and having plenty of room for often mystically intertwined melodrama, grotesque, and violence.Granted I am not a historian, but I did not sense anything inauthentic in the way ""Lawless"" tells its admittedly grotesque and violent story. The movie does not savor the violence and does not dwell on it; it simply vividly and honestly reflects it as a fact of life.The villain of the piece, the sleazy sadistic Special Agent Charlie Rakes impressively played by Guy Pearce is definitely grotesque, but is his character over the top? To me, the detestable federal agent Charlie Rakes is not less authentic than the noble federal agent Eliot Ness from ""The Untouchables"".Instead of chasing the formidable, powerful and extremely hard to catch villains like Al Capone, Charlie Rakes focuses on a seemingly easy target – the Bondurant brothers – mere rural moonshiners Forrest (Tom Hardy, Howard (Jason Clarke) and Jack (Shia LaBeouf). He eagerly unleashes a ruthless war on them, the war quite disproportionate to the magnitude of their crime.It does not strike me as impossible or unbelievable that an individual who took that wicked path might possibly have had certain peculiar, sadistic in nature personality traits.In addition, the Charlie Rakes' grotesque brutality nicely counterbalances the rural legend of the Bondurant brothers' ""immortality"". The brothers finally got a worthy archenemy to test the validity of their bold legend.Yet other critics were noticed condescendingly smirking at the female movie characters - Maggie Beauford (Jessica Chastain), a dancer from Chicago and Forrest Bondurant's darling and Bertha Minnix (Mia Wasikowska), daughter of the local preacher and Jack Bondurant's sweetheart.Not being able to find any faults in the Jessica Chastain's and Mia Wasikowska's superb performances, the critics venomously remarked that the gifted actresses were regrettably constrained by their formulaic characters - ""love interests"" of the respective Bondurant brothers.Let me remind to these critics that the events of the movie take place in Prohibition era (almost a century ago) in the rural Franklin County,Virginia and represent the bloody ruthless confrontation between the local bootleggers and the federal special agent.Now, let me ask the critics a question: ""What role, other than the love interest, do you with your undoubtedly sophisticated minds see for the female characters in this movie?"" Do you want them to zealously participate in the fistfights, knifing, and fire exchanges along with the men just like the CIA agent Evelyn Salt? That would be very authentic indeed! Alternatively, maybe you want to them to be more of Jane Austen or Charlotte Brontë types and happily rattle all these ""Sense and Sensibility"" or ""Jane Eyre"" lines? That would certainly be quite believable and appropriate for the movie!That is not to say that ""Lawless"" does not have its faults. Its story could have been a little leaner, crispier and more focused. Some of the scenes, including the well-made scenes with the famous mobster Floyd Banner (Gary Oldman in a memorable performance) should probably have been edited out as overall insignificant and unnecessary.Not without faults, ""Lawless"" nevertheless boasts solid screenplay, strong directing, a beautiful cinematography (Benoît Delhomme), excellent casting (Francine Maisler), memorable acting ( Tom Hardy, Jason Clarke, Shia LaBeouf, Guy Pearce, Jessica Chastain, Mia Wasikowska, Gary Oldman and the rest of the acting crew), and last but not least – excellent original music score (Nick Cave, Warren Ellis).Most importantly, ""Lawless"" is an engaging, masterfully and honestly told story. It can be confidently recommended for those movie lovers who can well tolerate the very strong graphic violence the movie contains.knowyourmovie.blogspot.com",Lawless
163,cultjones,Lawless,7,11 February 2013,"Based on the novel, The Wettest County by Matt Bondurant, Lawless is a story that takes place during the Depression-era when prohibition is in effect and moonshine is a profitable business. The Bondurant brothers, played by Tom Hardy, Shia LaBeouf and Jason Clarke are bootleggers shrouded in myth. LaBeouf, the youngest tries to fit in with his hardened brothers while the corrupt law attempts to tighten its noose on Franklin County. Guy Pearce, a ruthless deputy, is the henchman sent to enforce the crooked law.With a heavy weight cast that also includes Gary Oldman, and a great story, Director John Hillcoat had all the ingredients for a runaway hit. Hardy is arguably the future of Cinema and with Gary Oldman, a performer who melds in to the characters he's portraying, you know you're going to experience acting brilliance. Sadly, Oldman's part is practically a cameo while Hardy, who is generally superb, is hard to comprehend at times owing to his mumbling of the dialogue. Guy Pearce has come a long way from his Australian soap days and has established himself as a diverse actor. In Lawless, Pearce wears the mask of a villain convincingly while LaBeouf delivers a decent performance.Hillcoat produces a slow paced and gritty film that gradually builds to a climax however one can't help but feel that there could've been more. Arguably, Lawless is more about the characters and Hillcoat was trying to keep it as realistic as possible but still, there was a longing for more. Perhaps it was the expectations that were unrealistic? Either way, Lawless is certainly worth a watch.",Lawless
164,mike3386,Help! Am I Losing My Hearing?,7,17 December 2014,"I really, really want to like this movie - a lot - but so much of the dialog is unintelligible that I felt cheated after watching it - twice. Before you write this off to ""bad flat panel speakers"", I have a complete Yamaha sound system that makes every sound/word crystal clear - except in ""Lawless"" where the - admittedly good - music soundtrack often drowns out everything else. Not to mention that Tom Hardy (Forrest Bondurant) delivered his lines with a mumble and a grunt anyway. Worse, the first time I saw it was at a major theater; understood less there because I could not stop it and run it back . . . which actually doesn't help much either. Would estimate of the words spoken in this movie, I understood NO MORE THAN 60% of them.All that said, the rest of the movie is glorious to WATCH; Hillcoat has such a fine way of bringing in the ""little things"", the roughness of lumber, the scuffed brogans, the splendor of a country setting, albeit he did not quite match his wonderfully violent ""Proposition"", with it's flies and armpits. Who could not revel in the 1930s prohibition setting? Yes, the screenplay bordered on sophomoric at times, e.g., given a chance to blow away a totally evil Charlie Rakes (Guy Pearce), the Bondurants, especially Jack (Shia LaBeouf), pass up the opportunity for no apparent reason.Is it me, or is John Hillcoat wed to working with Nick Cave and Guy Pearce? Gary Oldham's presence in the movie, as Floyd Banner, is little more than a distraction. What was that all about? Did Gary just need some work for a couple weeks? His character was more than over the top, we had no way to even get to know this menace with a Thompson submachine gun.Is it just me or was anyone else distracted by the frequent and relatively easy jaunts – in 30's era vehicles – between Franklin County, VA and Chicago, IL?

Now mind you I am using the term ""anti-hero"" loosely, because the ""point"" of this movie is apparently to portray a bunch of sadistic, criminal hicks as ""the good guys"". Yep, we are yet again going down that same American Feelgood Road, and since probably every Jewish, Irish and Italian criminal has been romanticized beyond any measure in countless movies it's now the turn of the anglo-saxon ""average American farmboy"".I would have said the script to this movie was written by someone drinking moonshine, but then again it's Weinstein, so let that speak for itself.",Lawless
168,patrickwigington,Men of the Mountains,10,30 August 2012,"Outlaw movies always have some merit to them. Many achieve greatness, such as Bonnie and Clyde and The Wild One among others. Now, Lawless, a true story about bootleggers in the mountains of Virginia during the prohibition, joins that list of movies.The film follows the lives of the 3 Bondurant brothers, who are the kings of moonshining in their county. However, one day a man called Charlie Rakes from Chicago comes to town, and forces the county to pay $20 commission on each barrel for their ""protection"". Of course it's a scam, and the Bondurant boys refuse to cooperate. Under regular circumstances that would have been enough to have them killed. However, these brothers are different. Forrest, the leader of the brothers, is a beast of a man. His older brother Horace is equally as violent and much more ill tempered. Not to mention there is a legend surrounding them that they are all immortal. Then there is Jack Bondurant, who is the youngest, and the one that just doesn't have the will for killing people. Which is what these guys have to do in this business.The acting alone makes the movie quite an experience. Tom Hardy, who played Bane in this years' The Dark Knight Rises, plays Forrest. He speaks with a slow southern drawl that sounds like if Andy Griffith was born on the very wrong side of the tracks. Like his character in Batman, he plays a monster that can seemingly not be stopped, no matter what the opposition does. The only difference is that we're on his side, and he has a nice heart deep down. Shia LaBeouf is quite surprising as Jack, who is the main character in the movie. He loses his innocence as the movie goes on, since things always get worse and worse in these types of movies. Guy Pearce plays Rakes, the mobster from Chicago. He creates a character that is merciless, evil, and actually quite terrifying. There is no hint of kindness in his eyes, and he gives layers to the character that make him seem like a man twisted beyond recognition by hate and cruelty.The script, written by musician Nick Cave, is a powerhouse. The story is based on true events, detailed in the book The Wettest County in the World written by one of the grandsons of the Bondurant brothers. Cave creates a world that is dominated by either poverty, criminal activities, or in many cases, both. The men who make the moonshine live in wooden houses and drive beat up old cars, while the men from Chicago live and dress like kings. The violence is brutal and intense, with each passing fight or murder more bloody and gruesome than the last.Director John Hillcoat does not shy away from the brutality and violence of this story. And that is what makes this film so compelling. People are beaten, stabbed, gunned down, and have their throats slit open. All of this is shown explicitly and without flinching. But Hillcoat does more than just create a bloodbath of a world; he makes the county of Prohibition era Virginia come alive. Jack Bondurant falls in love with the preacher's daughter, a girl from Chicago comes to live with the brothers, and there are many interesting supporting characters that help make this movie into a stunning masterpiece.The music, a mixture of old time folk music, and original music composed by Nick Cave and Warren Ellis, is another fantastic element of this movie. The scene between Jack and the preacher's daughter in Church is a stunning example of this, as well as many other moments in the film.Lawless is a violent and brutal movie that captures the essence and danger of living in that time. This movie is a classic that is beautiful to watch and take in.",Lawless

Lawless feels more like a western than the usual gangster take on the time period.

Basicallyeverything you might expect from a classic western that would make ole John Wayne proud.The cast is stellar. Tom Hardy (still kicking ass without his Dark Knight Rises Bane mask), Shia LaBeouf (Transformers) and Jason Clarke (Public Enemies) perfectly blend in together as Virginia's infamous moonshining Bondurant brothers. Jessica Chastain (The Help, Take Shelter) and Mia Wasikowska (Alice in Wonderland, The Kids Are All Right) both radiate beauty as women who motivate the men around them, and Guy Pearce (The King's Speech, The Hurt Locker) is nothing short of perfection as the amazing dirty lawman villain Charlie Rakes.

170,axopnk,Lawless is not Flawless,5,26 September 2012,"Lawless has three main issues that makes it from becoming a terrific film: Expectations/presentation, Characters and Storyline.Lawless was presented in the commercials and the tag line as being a Mob/Mafia crime thriller. That's the problem I have with this film, it was presented as something else and what we received was not expected. Again, that's the problem when you have expectations and actual reality. Should we be the one's to blame for it? No. It was presented to us that way. The commercials show Tommy Guns, violence etc. Instead what we got was very little action and a very slow place story. Literally, if you watched this at a midnight showing you probably would fall asleep at some point during the film. I almost did and I didn't even watch the midnight showing.In terms of characters, first is the use of Gary Oldman. Gary Oldman is a excellent actor but the way he was under utilized in the film.He only has about 3 scenes in the entire movie. No more than 5 minutes. So out of a 2 1/2 hour film we get Gary Oldman, a Mob person for only about 10 minutes? Yes that's correct. The problem with the film is it didn't really focus on Oldman's character as a Mob boss despite his story being the most interesting and intriguing. Let's be honest, people love films about Mafia and the Mob. Look at Goodfellas, The Godfather, The Sopranos etc. So we want to see them more involved. Here? Very minimal. I certainty wanted to see why did Gary Oldman shoot that car in the beginning. Instead the story never goes down that road.Second problem I have is Guy Pierce's ending. Guy Pierce through the entire film was excellent. You really hated the guys guts. He killed without mercy and was a very cold, calculating killer who used his position of authority to justify his ends. But his ending was terrible. For someone to be so smart and calculating it didn't make sense that he would allow Shia Lebeouf to just walk up to him shoot him and for his brother to knife him. That type of ending makes you feel like, why didn't they just shoot him in the beginning? It made a character that felt special feel average. Another point, why is the town Sheriff even helping him? He felt like a lone rogue out of everyone with no other man support from Chicago to force the Sherriffs to obey him. It makes his threats idle. What did the town sheriff's have to lose? Didn't seem like anything especially since one of them shot Guy Pierce at the end.Lastly is the storyline. Maybe the director felt he wanted to keep it closer to the actual book. But the issue I have is if people want to know more, than read the book the movie is based on. Audiences want to see a movie that's entertaining and intriguing. Yes even a little Hollywood is good now and then. That's the problem with basing a movie on a book. One party, whether the book reader or the film audience is going to feel dissatisfied.For me a better storyline would be brothers make alcohol, higher law officials become involved and want a part of that money, brothers refuse are pushed to a brink, deal with te mob, mob becomes involved to protect it's assets, than begins to control the entire town, now brothers must break free from mob. Instead? Some plot holes.First, why didn't the mob become more involved with the brothers? Obviously the quantity and quality of alcohol brought the mob huge amounts of money. So why didn't they try to protect their assets? The mob must have known that their assets are being pressured by the law.Secondly, my understanding is that Guy Pierce was hunting them down because the brothers refused to make a deal with the District Attorney.But that doesn't make sense. The District Attorney wanted to have a cut of the profits. After that Guy Pierce goes on a rampage killing, destroying etc. At some point you'd think the District Attorney would tell him OK stop, I want a share of the profits and your destroying the assets that makes profits. We just want to convince them to make the deal. Let me put it this way. You want to buy a farm. Farmer says no. You still want that farm so you tell a guy OK destroy the farm? No sense.Third, Guy Pierce's character would make more sense chasing down Gary Oldmans character, later finds out he is dealing with the brothers, tries to cut off his suppliers to ""hit him where it hurts"" Gary Oldman becomes involved and maybe learns something on being a better person. Instead? Guy Pierce a trained Chicago law official wants to chase some moonshine making brothers who sell to small fish despite the mob being a bigger threat in Chicago as well as Gary Oldman being on the run.Still I give it 5 stars because the actors were excellent in the role and I do give credit for orginality because it focused on the alcohol makers instead of the mob. But is that what we wanted or were presented? No.",Lawless
171,Expat-in-America,Well acted historical piece,8,27 April 2021,"This is one of the movies I can rewatch whenever I see it on. All the main cast (Hardy, Clarke, LeBeouf, Oldman, Pierce. Chastain) are phenomenal actors whom I've enjoyed in other projects so altogether they make an all star cast.My only comment would be they could have done more with LeBeouf's character, by dropping the romance storyline and giving him a meatier role to play better suited to his immense talent.",Lawless

173,BharatSamra,"Not quite flawless, but a great story",7,14 September 2012,"With a biographical premise situated in Prohibition Era USA, 'Lawless' follows the inspired true story of the infamous Bondurant brothers; successful bootleggers who face adversity in the hands of their consumers, and more prominently a corrupt Virginia government.The brothers themselves share a very interesting and deep-seated relationship which appears to have been maintained consistently since their childhood. Shia LaBeouf's portrayal as the youngest, Jack Bondurant, has a great sense of lost identity, as he appears to be misplaced within his own family, whom overall are regarded as a great threat and physically authoritative by Franklin County. LaBeouf delivers a fantastic performance, despite perhaps suffering from PTSD (Post Transformers Script Disorder) and is only moonshined, excuse me, outshone by Tom Hardy as his older brother Forrest. As the primary source for fluent comedic value, Forrest ironically is the most solemn of all the characters, perhaps behind Guy Pearce as Special Agent Charlie Rakes. Pearce's flawless depiction of the antagonist carries a particular calm viciousness to it, whereby his actions and tone do not necessarily require a ferocious persona, yet it is his body language and threat of actions which consequently determine his ominous character.The narrative commences with an intriguingly slow pace that feels a necessary method of storytelling in a hybrid genre of biographical drama and gangster film. This allows accessibility into the characters and delves into the tensely forbidden business of alcoholic distribution. One could criticise however, the sudden changes in pace between melodramatic scenes and gruesome action sequences. 'Lawless' would perhaps benefit more from maintaining the pace we commenced with, as slow and steady could have won director John Hillcoat the race, the race being that of a higher rating and awards. Moreover, irrelevant characters appear to have been initiated into the production, with a meaningless contribution to the plot or any character development. Gary Oldman as Floyd Banks feels completely unnecessary, and his amount of screen time in minutes could perhaps be counted using just one hand, certainly with both. Though an enjoyable appearance, one becomes confused at his disappearance from the film and begins to question why he was used as a marketing tool, via theatrical posters and trailers, when the necessity of his character is non-existent.As a whole, 'Lawless' is a terrific Prohibition Era picture than encapsulates the entirety (as we can imagine it) of the time between 1920 and 1933 in the USA. In no way does time cause exacerbation to Hillcoat's film, in fact the second hour of this biographical moving image could in fact be more engaging than its predecessor. Furthermore, we are witnesses to flawless acting as well as truly tremendously written dialogue, with thematic devices including oppression, corruption and deception. It would be understandable for one not to enjoy 'Lawless' on the basis of its unstable fluency, questionable characters and indeed if one was not to enjoy the prohibition topic. You will not leave the theatre feeling your mind has been liberated by a cinematic masterpiece, but more so feel you have been told a memorable story, expressed by memorable acting, without the need to commit yourself to a second viewing for some time, if ever again.",Lawless
174,richy1024,Law corruption attempts to overhaul a trio of brothers in this true story epic.,8,23 September 2012,"Nick Cave's adaptation of Matt Bondurant's novel ""The Wettest County in the World"", based on the true story of his past Bondurant brothers, Jack (Shia LeBeouf), Forest (Tom Hardy) and Howard (Jason Clarke), comes a truly emotional piece set in the Depression-era of 1930's America. Located in the scenic Franklin province of Virginia, we experience a tone of symphony, intermittently inflexible grafting men and a trio of brothers of varying personalities. This depiction of the Bondurant brothers characterises them as symbolic personalities within the town. LeBeouf's incredibly typical performance as the delicate, skinny but brave hero often the characteristic associated with those who are the younger brother. Hardy is patriotic, brawny and permanently durable, allied with the persona of the forefront of the triangle piece. Clarke ingeniously stumbles around the other two as the drunken, fickle enforcer of recklessness know-how. This is a family of respect, with a reputation of autonomy and tribute.Lawless is a wonderful period drama with interceptions of boisterous nutcrackers to break up the flow of the narrative to demonstrate the severity of the story and the robustness of the epoch of Cave's western episode. This sternness is given an unruly tone with the introduction of Chicago law enforcer Rakes (Guy Pearce). His arrival employs an extreme rivalry as he implements a command of violence in an attempt to restore order by his decree. The Bondurants directly refuse to abide by Rakes' policies, therefore as rabble chief, Rakes attempts to take stern action to restore order with vicious outtakes on the folks of Franklin, enticing the Bondurants to backlash to re-establish their pride and possessions.Please note Tom Hardy's talent in this outing. His character, Forest, encompasses a generic likability with a hard foiled timber body, cheating his demise and turning up with the sporadic grunt throughout certain parts, in particular in comedic shape when Maggie (Jessica Chastain) declares herself absent from her outfit for the day and partakes in what can only be presumed to be a night of eroticism with Hardy. The personality of Forest feels somewhat transparent of Hardy's Bane in The Dark Knight Rises, leading and dominating the scene with a compound of emotion. If this calendar year hasn't propelled Tom's odds of absolute stardom over the next few years then one would find it painfully tricky to calculate what would. His protagonist partner LeBeouf, although faint and frail as Jack, ultimately becomes the paramount hero whilst adopting a chirpy and pert personality as seen in the Transformers trilogy, developing a tang for suits and boots whilst trading business with his infantile partner Cricket (Dane DeHaan), he alluringly grabs the attention of Bertha (Mia Wasikowska), widening the potential of aggravating her reverend father.There are some beautiful themes and notions within Hillcoat's screening with an unquestionable amount of talented emotion. From the first equilibrium the stage is set for a lasting feel of sentiment and passion that scale this movie with great integrity, supplying us with how many would demonstrate the jagged and antagonising pressures of that era. There is magnificent character expansion and the appreciative temperament between the cast is utterly majestic. The candle will continue to burn for this radiant piece of cinema for an undeniable period of time.",Lawless

177,luke-eberhardt,Fire and Brimstone Streak at this Slightly Different Take on the Gangster Genre,8,28 October 2012,"I've anticipated this film since its competition at Cannes. I heavily enjoyed Australian director John Hillcoat and screenwriter/musician Nick Cave's previous collaboration; ""The Proposition"". Its Adapted from Matt Bondurant's novel ""The Wettest County in the World"", based on his great great grand parents records taking us back to 1930s Prohibition America.The Story follows the life and exploits of the thee bootlegging Bondurant Brothers, Forrest (Tom Hardy), Howard (Jason Clarke) and Jack (Shia laBeouf). Distributing moonshiners across each regions of the county and dealing with trouble when needed; although they don't take to this too lightly. Their activities have made them somewhat immortal according to the towns folk, Although when Charlie Rakes (Guy Pierce) arrives in town, things start to get out of hand for the worst, as Rakes is much more decisive and corrupt than the common folks assume. It is now up to Jack to prove his worth in the business and defend his family and friends.Other characters include Floyd Banner (Gary Oldman) well known gangster wanted in three states but manages to strike a deal with Jack while Forrest is injured, Criket Pate (Dane Dehaan) Jack's friend and fellow moonshiner producer for the business, Maggie Beauford (Jessica Chastain) former urban singer/dancer who works at the Bondurant's restaurant and develops a relationship Forrest, and Bertha Mannix (Mia Wasikowska - Pronouced Vah-shee-Koff-ska) the preacher's daughter and Jack's love interest.Its got a fantastic cast as you see, powerfully acted in every way, you could almost call this a benchmark for each of their careers. Shia laBeouf does a really job as wannabe tough nut Jack, he shows he's got a lot to prove to shake off that mainstream image of the Transformers franchise. A lot of critics also pointed out Tom Hardy's attempt at an American accent here sounded more like incoherent mumbling at times (I definitely understood what he said), He serves as a guidance for Jack and most active of the brothers. Guy Pierce is possibly the main highlight here, he plays a brilliant hard bastard as Rakes; cunningly violent and devious, he made sure with both Hillcoat and Cave this villain had to be memorable. Even though this feels very much like a man's world, its thanks to the supporting female cast members that give some more character understanding and sentimentality away from all the violence.Other supporting cast member make memorable appearances throughout the film. Many say Gary Oldman was underused and could've been integrated into the plot more.The Cinematography and Production design are fantastic and really does bring you back to this fascinating time. Beautifully shot, the film capture the beauty of Franklin County, Virginia. Prohibition really was the rise of organised crime, while HBO's Boardwalk Empire explores a lot of the Urban gangster activities, its Lawless that shows more of the rural side of the era. In some way Hillcoat wanted to explore the end of the western-sort-of era and the beginning of the gangster era. It also has a great soundtrack that Cave composed alongside is close friend Warren Ellis, combines Prohibition Blues with due to this Cave has joined the ranks as one of my favourite film score composers.On a down side, even though though film is beautifully shot and powerfully acted, there's not enough substance in the film to reach that high standing point the film so wants to be. Thats whats missing that probably most casual viewers can't seem to find. So it still means ""The Proposition"" is superior on its own ground compared to this.As for me I loved it! ;) It is violent, thrilling and really keeps viewers drawn in.I could include this as one film that really sums up what I find fascinating about outlaws especially during this time period. This film however is incredibly watchable for one's fascination and definitely one of my favourites as of this year. I'm now curious to read the book its based on.",Lawless
178,darkraven_109,Decent and brutal look at the Prohibition Era,6,25 November 2012,"Save for a few, there have been very few movies that take place in the great crime wave that swept the USA during the Prohibition Era released in this decade. And close to none of them didn't take place in a setting that wasn't a big city; every Prohibition movie I know by far was characterized by big cities with gangsters swarming the place and shooting people. LAWLESS is a different take on this familiar subject; not only does it take place in the Southern parts far from the cities but it also presents a dark and brutal look at one of the most romanticized bits of history on film.That's the strongest point of LAWLESS for me aside from its stellar cast. LAWLESS provides a new and dark look at a really popular subject for period pieces. It was a refreshing take on the whole gangster mythology since I doubt that the ""Robin Hood"" type gangsters were so perfect in the days even if they did do some charitable stuff. Here we have 1920's bootleggers who aren't opposed to respecting family values and swearing at nearly any given opportunity while delivering brutal punishment. Take note, the movie is a violent take on a familiar topic so if you're not used to that, prepare yourself.The cast pulls off their roles very well; you can either hate or connect with each character throughout the movie's run time and it actually makes you care for their fates in the end. Shia finally shows off what talent he's got beyond acting alongside CGI robots; while I think he could do better in the future, this isn't a bad start for the young actor. The likes of Guy Pearce could've used a lot more screen time, though.A problem I had with LAWLESS was its pacing. For some reason, the entire first half was slow and dragging. The exposition and introduction to the story's characters was done in a manner that took its time way too much. This could possibly alienate some viewers as it nearly did to me; I was almost convinced that the movie would end flatly since I couldn't get myself into the movie at first but the movie more than makes up for it by the second half all the way to the end. Things pick up pace and the story moves faster by the halfway point and this is where things begin to get interesting. The ending could've also used some working; for a dark tale, LAWLESS ends on a very clichéd note. I don't know if this was really based on real events and if some liberties were taken while writing the script but the movie ended predictably.Definitely not the best period piece but one of the better ones made, LAWLESS does its job of telling a brutal tale set during the infamous Prohibition era. If you're the type of person who enjoyed PUBLIC ENEMIES and is waiting in anticipation for GANGSTER SQUAD (which unfortunately is going through a lot of reshoots thanks to the tragedy in THE DARK KNIGHT RISES shooting), you should definitely check out LAWLESS.LAWLESS won't impress everyone, though; it's not a surefire hit like how something like GODFATHER was. Some may appreciate the new take on a familiar tale while others could be turned off by it. Some would be expecting an action piece while others will be satisfied with the drama involved but in the end, LAWLESS is a film that's definitely worth checking out no matter what your final verdict on it would be.",Lawless
179,coiffuremixte,Gone to look for America,10,20 September 2012,"If I had to sum up Lawless in two words they would be 'pleasure' and 'unexpected. Usually an unexpected pleasure is something which goes against our preconceptions and expectations. This isn't what I mean, not exactly, more that 'Lawless' is a work of art which expresses pleasure through its characters and their lives and stories, and induces pleasure in the viewer via its use of character sympathy, emotion and music to a point where it's not like anything else. The unexpected is almost a theme to itself within 'Lawless' which is a gangster film while not a gangster film, a western perhaps a period drama. The references to other depression-era outlaw films could be thrown at 'Lawless', for example 'Bonnie and Clyde' 'Thieves Like Us'(Altman) but the 70's realism doesn't stick (although Penn's film was itself filled with the irreverence, humour and energy of the French Nouvelle Vague of Jean Luc Goddard). There's perhaps more of the classical western such as Ford's 'My Darling Clementine' or 'The Searchers' swimming in the evolutionary pool. An elegant romantic stoicism which yearns for a better world away from cruelty and suffering where love and virtue are the only laws. In 'Lawless' the awkward beginning of love for damaged adults is painted in deep red and autumn browns and snow falls magically on the darkest horror. In this world bullet casings become treasured objects or jewelry. The beauty contrasts with the ugliness, the disease and its cure side by side; would one be as potent without the other? The naive glorification of the inglorious real-life figures it depicts is perhaps the flaw of Lawless and also its greatest strength, the folk legend is more potent than any ugly truth, any moralising, any realism. Isn't true realism only a feeling, an emotion, a recognition of a truth we hold within us? What is shocking is how the characters in Lawless throw themselves with such earnestness at their fate in a way which defies reason, the way they embrace life in all its glory despite the risks.In 'The Man Who Shot Liberty Valence' Ford observed that we ultimately print not the objective truth but the 'myth' that's what people want. In 'Lawless' Tom Hardy's Bondurant - a superhero in his own right, albeit a criminal superhero - believes his own myth and when he finds out that there has been an exaggeration in the process of its printing is unmoved, only amused and vaguely surprised. The humour of this moment sums up the unexpected pleasure of 'Lawless'.I think that the plotting and scripting are unlike anything seen before while dealing with clichés at every turn, which is a miracle in itself. Watching the film becomes almost like listening to a great new tune from some magical gap left in between all the wonderful old music you've heard.The acting in this film is a collective leap of faith from all concerned; a singular vision conveyed by each performer, from Oldman as a big-time Chicago hoodlum, DeHaan as the sympathetic crippled young moonshiner and sidekick, Chastain as the tart-with-a-heart cliché with a soul, Pearce's comic-book villain sicko, Wasikowska as the charming preacher's daughter, Hardy as the inarticulate anti-hero with a big heart, to LaBeouf's sensitive foolish kid trying to live up to his brothers' example. All actors involved give exceptional dignity and soul to the story which is the essence of the film's power and success.",Lawless
180,richcarter1962,Finally Something Shia LaBeouf Can Act In,9,30 January 2013,"I really enjoyed this movie. If you are thinking about seeing this movie and have decided not to based on the fact that Shia LaBeouf is the most recognized name in the movie, then you need to reconsider. There are strong performances from all 3 of the brothers Bonderant. Tom Hardy has the most screen time, with the least amount of lines since Schwarzenegger's Terminator. It was nice to see LaBeouf in something that allowed him to stretch his acting talent, he is quite good in this role. If you saw Guy Pearce in L.A. Confidential you wouldn't recognize him in this role.The plot is based on a novel by Matt Bondurant, I assume the descendant of the brothers this movie centers around. There wasn't a lot new the plot that hasn't been done before, despite that this movie will hold your attention. I was really impressed with way the director handled the violence here. It would have been easy to make this a gory mess, and it would not have been nearly as good a movie. The violence is mostly and undercurrent in the movie until the final scene and the way the tightrope is walked keeps you in suspense for the next violence.If you liked the Untouchables, or American History X, or Gangster Squad then there is good chance you will like this movie as well. I gave this movie a 9, and perhaps that is a little high, but it was one of those movies, where when it ended I said to myself that was a really good movie.",Lawless
181,ericzillazillo,"Why can't a film have near-perfect characters, for once?",5,5 December 2012,"Now I realize that lawless is ""based on"" an imperfect human story. In which one of the most important objects is alcohol. So it would be realistic for characters to bear alcohol-induced irrationality. But as far as I'm concerned, this is an action film, and I don't know about others, but I watch films to be entertained, and this film was way too annoying to be entertaining. Even in the beginning, I wanted to jump into the screen and warn the protagonists: ""if you don't do what this dangerous bad guy says, you're gonna walk out of this alive- but barely. And your friends will be greatly harmed."" Because we all know that films with smart calculating protagonists who do a good job of minimizing casualties are not entertaining (sarcasm). This film does a great job getting on my nerve with the fruity emotional all-American story-line. For once, I'd like to see the hero be the backstabber (I know it's not batman-ethical but it is the better way to solve this). For once, I'd like to see a character make effort to actually solve an emotional breakdown by yelling or slapping, or just simply help the person with emotional breakdown do what he is supposed to do. For once, I'd like to see the bad guy kill the wimp instead of allowing the wimp to recover and in return, kill the bad guy. For once, I'd like to see characters practicing ultra-extreme caution when they've offended a major criminal, instead of making silly mistakes such as leading the bad guys to their secret hideout. Now, one thing I really wanted to see was for the protagonist to exercise his revenge by coolly making accurate shots to the bad guy's chest, instead of getting shot. Speaking of shooting, the action scenes in this film are really just okay, not superb but not bad either.The film makes it difficult to like and sympathize with most of the main characters, because most of them were f***ing ***holes. In the first half of the film, I honestly did not care if the good guys had been completely wiped out.Verdict: This film is worth the watch. Barely. If you want a film about idiots maiming each other, there you go. But this film would be much more watchable if the emotional crap were cut out and replaced with more shooting.",Lawless
182,Jipper2,A Low Appeal Film that was Genuinely Good,8,14 December 2012,"I have to admit that when this movie came out I lumped it in with HBO's Boardwalk Empire. Both lacked appeal but seemed up my ally of things I'd like. I considered going to theaters to see it but the lack of appeal and all, I waited. Once I did watch it I really enjoyed it. I knew nothing of the true story so I can't compare it to real life. Usually when I compare real life to movies or books to movies, then I don't enjoy the movie. In this case I fortunately didn't know the true story or read the book and the film was very enjoyable.There were continuity issues throughout the film but to me it was all small stuff that I could overlook. The biggest two downfalls of the movie in my opinion was the montage in the early mid-part of the movie. If you're going to give me a montage at least play me some 80's music to go alone with it. The movie also felt like it ran longer than it did. Yeah, I know I just complained about a montage shortening the movie and the movie feeling like it ran long. Trust me, they could have done away with the montage, added some time to the length of the movie and still not made it feel like a 3 hour movie if done right.The best part of the movie in my opinion was Tom Hardy's performance. I've seen Hardy in a couple of films but I wasn't a huge fan or anything. Watching this movie I noticed just how good of an actor he was. I believe his performance took this movie up a level. For me Shia Lebouf has become so out of touch with reality he turns me off from a movie almost as much as Tom Cruise does. It's not that I dislike Lebouf. I actually quite enjoyed him when he was younger and he's a fine actor. I just no longer have a desire to see him. Actually I'd prefer not to see him whenever possible. To me this movie is worth it. Lebouf did fine in his performance. Hardy clearly stole the show though. Not only from Lebouf but also from yet another good performance by Gary Oldman and an over the top but good performance from Guy Pierce who's transformed himself once again. The actress Mia Wasikowska (I had to look up her name) did a wonderful performance in her limited role as well. She was perhaps second only to Hardy in this movie for me.8 of 10 - Yeah there were flaws (as all movies have) but several good performances from great actors and two great performances from two up and coming actors/actresses made this movie stand out.",Lawless
183,TinyDanseur27,Great casting makes Lawless a great film!,9,19 June 2013,"When I heard that Jessica Chastain, Tom Hardy, Mia Wasikowska, Guy Pearce and Gary Oldman were in Lawless, I knew it was a movie worth seeing. I'm not a fan of Shia Labeouf, but honestly, he wasn't that bad in this film. He possessed a certain awkwardness that served his character Jack really well. Lawless takes place during Prohibition. It's about three brothers who make and sell illegal alcohol and their battle with ""the law"" to maintain their way of life in Franklin County, Virginia. Tom Hardy plays Forrest Bondurant, the middle-most and toughest brother. Shia Labeouf is Jack Bondurant, the youngest and narrator of the movie. Gary Oldman takes a bit part with his role as Lloyd Banner. Guy Pearce is the despicable Charlie Rakes, whose sole mission is to destroy the Bondurant brothers. Mia Wasikowska is Shia Labeouf's love interest and Jessica Chastain is the love interest of our hero Forrest. It's a very exciting, action-packed Western (of sorts) with lots of guns and fighting. I wasn't quite prepared for the brutality. It was quite plentiful in this film and very graphic. I haven't seen a movie this brutal since Inglourious Bastards.

The acting is fairly good but its all about moonshine bootleg and does not go to the next levelI was expecting more, there is good action in places but there are long boring bits, the ending disappointed me a bitoverall a watchable film, but not a great movie.works well in some scenes and then gets very dulli would watch it again but with low expectations the movie is not bad",Lawless
188,keith-w8888,excellent,8,5 December 2012,"One of the best cast and best directed movies I have seen all year. I am not a fan of prohibition or of the romanticising of criminals, but this is a very gritty and realistic true story of the history of the US during the 20's. Most people will not be disappointed. Every character comes across as realistic and credible, from the main characters to the ancillary. The script does not deviate from authenticity for the period, there is no modernism, nothing out of place and the sets and costumes are well researched and as authentic as can be. It is a triumph of authentic period drama and a good story well told. I hope to see this movie represented at next year's Oscar nominations.",Lawless
189,joecoby45,"Entertaining, yet very flawed movie.",6,8 February 2018,"Lawless is directed by John Hillcoat and written by Nick Cave. The two had previously collaborated on western masterpiece The Proposition, which is one of my all time favorite movies. So I was a bit disappointed with Lawless. as it was a deeply flawed movie. First lets start with what Lawless gets right. For one it looks great. The shop composition is fantastic. It also largely works as a period piece with realistic and accurate aesthetics all around ranging from the costumes to the environments. Its overall well directed and edited too. And last but not least it contains a stand out performance from character actor Guy Pearce who gives by far the most memorable performance in the film as the main bad guy.The biggest flaw however is the script. Which has many plot holes/contrivances and wooden, uninteresting characters. Not even great actors like Tom Hardy or Jessica Chastaine manage to shine with their roles. There simply is not enough to these characters to make you care.Also Shia Labeouf feels miscast to me. He does an alright job for the most part but he does not have the charisma or screen presence to be the lead of the film (especially not when he has to go toe to toe with actors like Guy Pearce, Tom Hardy, and Gary Oldman) he also doesn't know how to do a southern accent properly or consistently (to be fair Hardy also has trouble with this)There are individual great scenes in this film. But it does not add to being a solid film all around thanks to a incomplete feeling story with too many contrivances, and wooden one dimensional characters. Also why did this movie hire Gary Oldman (one of the finest actors of all time) for a role that amounted to nothing more than a cameo?!?!",Lawless
190,ruhi-yaman,Plays like a Tea Party wet dream,4,24 November 2012,"The film is supposed to be based on a true story. I am sure that there is a grain of truth in that. Yet, it doesn't come out in the finished product. Good old boys just out to make a living are by far too good to be true. The big smoke villains are government officials, which had gone rotten past the core, are more than a tad too villainous. And the ending goes beyond the call of duty to show that the problem was (an by implication still is) with the big government. If only, the good old country folk were left to themselves to sort their problems.For all the care taken to give an authentic feel, the film looks and feels staged and inauthentic. Shia LeBeouf, who makes each movie he appears in look like a Disney production, might as well be running away from the Transformer baddies. Hard to tell the difference except the costumes. Tom Hardy, a decent actor somewhat prone to overacting, believes that he is giving a Shakespearean turn as the philosophy spouting king of the moonshiners but ends up looking like a mumbling thespian that stumbled into the wrong picture. Two Australians that manage to grace every movie they appear in, Guy Pearce and Jason Clarke, acquit themselves but cannot help being wounded by the excesses of the script. Pearce, a genuinely generous performer, is forced to chew scenery as the pantomime-villain with the Dickensian name, Charlie Rakes.The film is also badly paced, the script is jerky and the anticlimactic finale is the final letdown.",Lawless
191,WildBullWriter,Much better than most Hollywood fare,8,11 October 2012,"Reading the other reviews, I'm amused by the number of reviewers who don't have a clue about how southern rural hill people behave (and esp. behaved back in the 1920s). They accuse Hardy, and to some extent LaBeouf, of bad acting because their characters are so laconic (that means they don't run off at the mouth a lot) and inward and don't wear every emotion on their sleeves. Then they mightily praise Oldman and Pearce for great acting when they were, in fact, just playing northern urban gangsters who like to behave over the top---the very thing that disgusts southern sensibilities.The folks making those review comments have probably spent too much time watching movies based on comic books and not enough time with dramatic characters representing actual human beings. So don't pay attention to their noise.Instead, watch the flick. It's good. I enjoyed it.",Lawless
192,marcusdean118,Tom Hardy loves grunting.,5,17 January 2013,"When this movie was in pre-production, I couldn't wait to see it. I loved The Road, which John Hillcoat directed also and its cast just excited me further. But I was left rather disappointed by the finished product, it seemed like the film wasn't entirely sure what it was aiming to do. Half of it plays like a prohibition Goodfellas, chronicling young Jack Bondurant as he rises through the family business of bootlegging. Which in fairness, would be a really fun film to watch, if the whole narrative was like it. But at crucial points the story takes itself way too seriously, trying to come across as a brooding epic, much like The Assassination of Jesse James, which considering the opening cheesy narration, it was never going to emulate.I know a lot of people have problems with Shia LaBeaouf as an actor, but I'm not one of those. I thought he was great in Holes, Disturbia and even most of Eagle Eye. But watching this movie, I sort of understood what everyone else was saying. He doesn't quite have the charisma the carry a movie in the lead role, he plays the weedy brother in the first half of the film very well. But when the tone shifts and he has to take over his brothers mantle as leader of the gang, it's never once convincing. Tom Hardy is an actor I love, he was great in Bronson and Inception (I personally didn't love him in Dark Knight Rises, but I understand why everyone else does) and I was excited to see him getting to grips with the classic Archetype of gang leader. But considering most of his work in the film is grunting and punching, he is underwhelming. As is Guy Pearce, who tries way too hard to be a quirky captivating villain from the big city. Trying to pull off a Christoph Waltz and failing.But yeah, the film's not bad. Its just not good. And considering the talent involved, you think it would have been. Oh yeah and Gary Oldman? Literally in it for about 8 minutes. Ridiculous sub-plot which never takes place where you think it's going to. Be warned also, there is a lot of awkward silences in the film, where dialogue surely must have been in the script, only to be replaced by Tom Hardy grunting. A must see for grunters all over the world.",Lawless
193,theburrus1,"A gem of a movie! All guts, no glamor, and achieves glory!",7,6 December 2012,"After having just seen Tom Hardy's outstanding performance as ""Bane"" from The Dark Knight Rises, I was intrigued about what else he has done and kinds of other characters he has portrayed. To my surprise, I found that he was in Inception, another great film but I had overlooked him when I viewed that film. Then, I found ""Lawless"". And just as he did in The Dark Knight Rises, Tom Hardy comes off with another brilliant performance as Forrest Bondurant, one of three brothers, with the other two being Howard and Jack Bondurant, played by Jason Clark and Shia LaBeouf respectively, all of which are bootleggers during the 1930's Prohibition Period in rural Virginia, USA.I found this to be Shia LaBeouf's best performance to date, personally, as it shows his true talent for acting, such a talent likely lost in the Transformers' movies in place of the CGI Autobots and Decepticons. His character starts off the movie showing his place in the role of things among the three brothers and that he doesn't have what it takes as a kid and he gets into trouble as an adult with the law as well. Still, you are able throughout to see what he experiences and his transformation (no pun intended) into a real man who ultimately takes initiative to save his family and friends and leading the charge to preserve their normal way of life.Guy Pearce plays his best role as the new yet ruthless, city-slicking, backstabbing Commonwealth Attorney who takes the law of Franklin County, Virginia into his own hands and then some, as he takes his job personally to stop the likes of the three brothers' bootlegging business, not so much because its illegal but simply out of spite. And finally Gary Oldman, yet again, shines brilliantly is his smaller yet important role in the film as a big timer in the county as controlling who sells and who doesn'tFinally, I must say that at first, the setting and surroundings of the film, don't seem like much to talk about but that is only the beginning and least of what this films aims to do. It aims to capture both the spirit of its time in American history whilst it shows that even ""criminal bootleggers"" can be the true good guys with good hearts in the face of big city government stepping in with its corrupted ways of justice.In the end, I say this is a must-see film. It certainly doesn't have all of the attention, hype and flair that other big time films of 2012 have seen, but if its a star in the night sky amongst all the others, you can it shines just as bright!",Lawless

195,imagineda,John Hillcoat's prohibition-era slow burner,8,22 February 2013,"If you've seen The Proposition or The Road, then you pretty much know what to expect from John Hillcoat. This latest outing sees Hillcoat once again paired with Nick Cave as screenwriter. This pair of Australians excel in creating a smouldering, menacing atmosphere that feels true to the era, and Lawless is no exception to the rule.The first fifteen minutes of the film are a bit shaky, the acting feels overdone and those southern drawls take a while to adjust to, but everyone settles into character soon enough. While some have criticised the slow pace of the film, you need to consider this is set in prohibition era deep south. For anyone with a bit of patience, there's a solid story here of sibling rivalry, strange family legends, slow burning romance and escalating violence, as the brothers and corrupt lawmen stake their claims.A lot has been said of Tom Hardy's unintelligible Forrest; well, it's consistent with the inward, soft spoken man of principle that Hardy portrays, and I understood most of what he said. One of the real surprises for me was Shia Lebeouf as Jack; for once he is given a grown up role as the berated little brother who goes to great lengths to earn his older brother's respect. There are a couple of romantic side stories; Jack's courting of preacher's daughter Bertha (a pretty unlikely pair), and former dancer Maggie's (Jessica Chastain) flight from her seedy past and into the reluctant arms of Forrest - both well done and segue nicely with the main story.Some of Cave's script can seem a little too poetic to be true, but on the whole it's gritty and original. Guy Pearce is downright slimy as corrupt special deputy Charlie Rakes; his contemptuous attitude towards the southern 'hicks' and numerous neurotic tics are something to behold. Gary Oldman and Noah Taylor are under utilised, but effective. And Jason Clarke as Forrest and Jack's brother Howard, conveys a lot with barely any dialogue.There wasn't a massive budget here, but the film manages to convey dense atmosphere and feels like a realistic portrayal of a very violent era.",Lawless
196,reneemsm,AWESOME!! I would give it 9 1/2 if I could,9,3 September 2012,"My husband and I went to see this on Friday night and we both LOVED it. My husbands exact words upon leaving the theater...""That movie was bad ass! We gotta buy that when it comes out."" It's full of manly men and testosterone which I loved ;-) We are history junkies and the sets/costumes were so completely spot on. It really had you feeling that you were in 1931 VA which I loved. The acting was amazing by EVERYONE. I thought Shia was PERFECT for his role and so was Tom Hardy. (Both HOT, too which doesn't hurt!!) I swear, lately every time I see Shia in something I like him more and more. This was no exception. The ladies did a great job too. Maggie was so gorgeous and believable and Mia (who I am generally not a fan of) was great and surprisingly had really great chemistry with Shia (I'd heard she hated him or something). I actually found myself with a big stupid grin on my face a few times during scenes with the two of them. Everyones accents were amazing and coming from someone whose entire family lives in/comes from VA and WV, they were very accurate. The guy who played Raikes (sp?) was perfect for that role also. He played a complete asshole and ""nancy boy"" (as Shia said) really well, though I'm not sure that's a compliment. haha There were a lot of times that the fighting scenes were so brutal that it was hard to watch. I read somewhere that Shia actually took most of the hits that he gets so it was kinda painful for me to watch because it felt so real. It is pretty bloody/violent but that's what you should expect for this type of movie. I didn't feel that it jumped around the way a few have said it did. I actually thought that they did a good job of balancing the good and the bad. If it was all dark it would have been difficult to watch. And to portray it as all good would have been inaccurate. I mean, it's based on the TRUE STORY, so you can't really complain about the sequence of events and blame the writer or director. It just is what it is. We honestly could have stayed and watched it again. And if it was brought to a closer theater I would definitely go see it again. On the way out, it seemed like most people in our theater loved it too. ***SPOILER*** (kinda) My one and only tiny thing I would change would have been the sex scene between Forrest and Maggie. I really wish it had been a little better. You've got these two hot actors whose sexual tension is building through the whole movie but you couldn't make the sex a little hotter? It starts out pretty good with her walking in naked but then it just falls flat. I felt a little cheated. If you've got the ""R"" rating, use it! But maybe that was just me.",Lawless
197,The_creator2010,"A mediocre plot supporting acts of violence and romance, however Mr Pearce rules it all!",7,30 September 2012,"Director John Hillcoat must have pulled some serious strings to reel in what appears to be a phenomenal cast representing what we hoped would be a fantastic film.Set in Virginia, County Franklin is home to the richest and poorest minorities. While parts of New Orleans is struggling within an era of the great depression, the Bondurant family run a bootlegging operation; a profitable alcohol business which proves to be the backbone to the family's financial survival and an income of reputation from the locals. Forrest Bondurant (Tom Hardy) is the eldest of three brothers who not only keeps the operation running, but the discipline of his screwball brother Howard (Jason Clarke) and Jack (Shia LaBeouf).While Forrest is the ""silent but deadly"" type and Howard a demented alcoholic, Jack is singled out as one with an emotionally detached personality and a liability to their operation. But it is when the town is greeted with a new face that the folks associated with the Bondurant family are put under scrutiny to spill the beans on the operation. Introducing Deputy Charlie Rakes (Guy Pearce), the devil of Virginia, who sees an opportunity in the Bondurant's alcohol business revealing a corruptness to his dark personality.With one eye on Charlie's demands, Forrest is caught up with new barmaid Maggie (Jessica Chastain) who is set on proving her loyalty to Forrest, and something more. As Deputy Charlie is hell bound on destroying the towns alcohol advantage, apprentice Jack is trying to balance an ambition of two sides; to prove his own worth for out of town gangster Floyd Banner (Gary Oldman), and to convince his love to upper class lady, Bertha (Mia Wasikowska).So as things quickly escalate, it is when Charlie and his cohorts of the law begin to use physicality in order to send a message to Forrest and co who remain stubborn under the pressure of the task force, leading to unnecessary violence and a clash of emotions. Jack, who metamorphose into a cocky somewhat brave new character following his association with Frankie, the result of his mind frame can either help rid Charlie's devious activities, or jeopardize everything the family have worked for.Based on factual events, the screenplay is well represented while the director had a variety of actors to nit-pick and blend with the right scene and their credentials. Unfortunately, besides from the quality within the cast, the only actor who stood out in this was Guy Pearce, who gave a haunting performance and took the portrayal of sadistic drama to another level. What is introduced and eventually closed as a fairy tale book, the seriousness of Pearce's on screen ambiance makes this flick seem more serious than I think the director had intended. Besides from a complete focus of darkness, Tom Hardy has still yet to disappoint as his grunting be-wildered character is fun to watch and yet again scripted to add that touch of comedy to the story, something he does quite well.Lawless ignores the straight up gun-slinging at times offering a refreshing element when it dies down. It reveals the balance of two potential relationships; with Forrest appearing skeptical of Barmaid Maggie and Jack dangling from the legs of a girl that would be classed out of his league.Shia Lebeouf is quite convincing as the rookie within the troubled family and although I am a fan of some of his work (Transformers only, not 2, defo not 3), he offers nothing other than a mediocre performance that could have been the result of having very little to represent. His character was left unexplored. However the biggest let down of Lawless was the cameo appearance from Gary Oldman. Whether that was down to actors choice I don't know, but you embrace his on screen presence at the littlest chance the film offers.Lawless gets a pass for portraying an emotional story that will always be memorable in terms of it being factual based, even if you do wonder how factual the telling actually is. The fact it is based on some sort of event does convince us to sit and watch it, but for other reasons such as a fictional element, the plot would still appear weak. Like many movies of this genre, the premise will try to win you over by re-tracing its steps with violent scenes. The violence does come every so often and when it does it hits hard, avoiding Quentin Tarantino's slapstick red sauce and more realistic gore, all at the hands of Pearce's character.I expected much more in terms of a better plot and smarter dialog. It appeared every time a dull moment was upon us, the film felt the need to dive in with over the top violence. Guy Pearce is the vigilante and is suspect to the result of the scenes you will most likely remember; the violent ones. He sticks out for that reason because his dialog and on screen portrayal alone will be the only motive behind anyone classing this movie one of the best of 2012. But is that fair? on the bases of one actors performance? maybe not, but the proof is on the screen.Overall; Entertaining to say the least with a back-forward love story, but without Guy Pearce, the plot and over all characters would have no impact when it comes to the award cabinet...Factual or not!

199,jessicareid,Brilliant drama,10,7 August 2013,"A lot of people are giving Lawless fairly negative reviews so I think I need to explain why it's such a great film. First of all it's really unique because of the specific setting of it during the prohibition in the United States which made it interesting viewing.It is about three brothers who are running an illegal but successful business which soon attracts attention they don't want and trouble ensues. There is quite a lot of action in this film but it is mostly about the drama and the different things each character goes through. There are some fantastic actors in this film who all show their versatility and most notable for me was Tom Hardy and Shia LaBeouf who did an amazing job of making their characters real to the audience and made you really care for them. It is quite a long film but so many different things happen and it kept me glued from start to finish. There are some very grim scenes, some intense action, emotional scenes and of course romance and even a few comical moments - I think this film has a bit of everything. This film is not all about the action so don't expect it to be, but the main element is the theme of brotherhood which I loved. Also the fact that Lawless is based on a true story made it really interesting for me.It won't be for everyone but I thought this film was brilliant and would recommend it.",Lawless
200,akupm,Lawless,7,25 November 2013,Review: The picture was based on a true story about three brothers who were involved in prohibition in the great depression in the 1930s.The actors played their roles expressively and in a professional manner. For a Gangster picture to be set in the Deep South was ironic because most mobster films are set in the big city such as Los Angeles or New York. But on the other hand the film was unique because of it setting and Deep South culture. The cinematography was artistic. I loved the way how the director captured the landscape of the country side and the Chicago city where it was home for mobsters. I enjoyed listening to the country side music and watching the Deep South culture. I thought the costume designing was appropriate for all the characters. As a critic I give the picture a 6/10,Lawless

202,murrayspeer,Falls far short of its potential,6,5 November 2019,"I'm extremely ambivalent about this movie. On the one hand Tom Hardy, Jessica Chastain, and Gary Oldman make any movie worth seeing. At the same time, they are underutilized in this movie in favour of Shia Laboeuf, Guy Pearce, and Mia Wasikowska. Laboeuf and Pearce are fine actors, but can't hold a candle to their supporting cast, while Wasikowska is one of the most over-rated movie stars working.On the one hand, the movie has a tremendous dichotomy of peacefulness and violence, family and crime, profit and principle - not unlike last year's ""Drive"". At the same time, it doesn't emphasize the dichotomy, instead allowing the disparate elements to blend into a confusing mish-mash of imagery. For example, the Guy Pearce character is supposed to be a study in opposites - dandified, prissy, and controlled in his public persona, while perverted and utterly psychotic in his moments of release. But Pearce's performance allows the violence and perversion to show through at all times, which ruins the impact of his ""unexpected"" violent outbursts.On the one hand, the movie has a compelling story about a remarkable family in a remarkable setting. At the same time, it gives us no reason to care about the characters or their struggles beyond ""Hey, this is Shia Laboeuf - I'm the protagonist."" Sorry, I need more reason to invest in a character than that.Overall, the movie needed better writing (in the plot structure and establishing character, mostly, not the dialogue), better directing, and more careful casting.I give it a 5/10 to symbolize my ambivalence, with +1 for Hardy and Chastain. 6/10",Lawless

205,darkobogojevic,Pointless!,3,22 November 2012,"This is profound example of pointless and boring movie! If goal of this movie was revenge then that's so poorly constructed that don't make any sense, because there is no solid reason to support that kind of extreme measures (so they need to make one at the end). If goal was growing up of Shia LaBeouf from boy to man, then even that is meaningless, because you don't become men if you sell liker to dangerous gangsters, buying expensive cars and trying to seduce preachers daughter. Not even coming of new deputy who want's his cut at all cost is not goal, because there is so much going on in this movie that every piece makes no sense at the end. Only bright star in this 'killer' movie is one and only Gary Oldman, that sadly has very small roll and even in that short time he was managed to pull out only meaningful and ruthless character in whole movie. Shia LaBeouf was giving his best, that's true, but in this kind of scenery with out course, is same as you overacting in front of mirror.

206,Yarayaraman,"Engaging, if underwhelming",6,27 January 2013,"Lawless is an odd film.It is a period piece, set in Prohibition era America, that attempts to reflect a true story honestly, and without too much blatant dramatisation. Performances are strong. Tom Hardy is excellent as always, as the central flawed but principled character looking after his local interests. With Guy Pearce providing an excellent counter balance as the despicable and amoral government high-flier on the scene to exploit and 'uphold the law'. Shia LaBeouf was far better than I expected him to be in such exulted company - given his character's inherent flaws in this film, immature and impulsive, being not unlike other characters he has played, he was able to hold his own.The story itself did not feel particularly original, regardless of it's authenticity, and was therefore presented to us in a way that we should invest more in the characters themselves. Unfortunately the characters were not engaging enough or fully fleshed out, and the outcome of the story itself was unfulfilling. I recently watched Margaret, and intensely character driven film with a serious running time and a message, but a less coherent story - which worked. I actually felt that Lawless should have been longer, with more character development or that the shorter running time be used to present a more coherent and engaging story. In the end it never fully managed to achieve either.It was this hybrid nature that made Lawless a difficult film to really enjoy. I was never sure what I was watching, and so failed to fully invest in the characters,or be entertained by the story as it unfolded.I would still recommend watching Lawless, as it is well made enough with great actors that you may find nuances in the film that I was unable, or unwilling, to fully appreciate.

I have seen it twice and Iove it! I think this movie should've gotten higher ratings if just for the cast alone. The acting was excellent! I'm a huge fan of Guy Pierce, but I absolutely hated his character; he was obsessed with the brothers and was a mean SOB if I can say that. Even though there the movie had a rape segment, I'm glad they didn't show it; I don't think anyone really wants to see that anyway. The murder scenes were done tastefully for this type of movie. For instance, they never showed Howard and Forrest cutting out the tongue of one of their enemies, but you knew what was going on by all the blood in the room, them holding knives and Howard handing the blood stained bag to his younger brother.I thought the story was compelling. We've all heard about bootlegger's and gangster's and that's not a new concept, but it wasn't just about violence in the South, it was about a family who did what they had to do to survive; it was all they knew how to do. It's about a town standing up for one another during tough times.It's not highly action packed, but if you like period pieces, you would enjoy this. I recommend it.",Lawless

There were probably some fictitious elements mixed in, which made it not so different from an average action movie.

210,kgmarra,"Great acting, story, and characters",8,4 September 2012,"When the law became corrupt, outlaws became heroes. The new crime/drama ""Lawless"" is filled with big names, including Shia LaBeouf, Tom Hardy, Guy Pearce, Jessica Chastain, and Gary Oldman. This film is based on the novel, The Wettest County in the World by Matt Bondurant, a grandson of one of the main characters in the novel.The plot surrounds the three Bondurant brothers from Franklin County, Virginia during the depression era. The brothers sell moonshine around town, despite the prohibition laws during this time.Corrupt Special Deputy Charlie Rakes (Pearce) finds out about the bootlegging and decides that he wants a share of the brothers' profits. Forrest (Hardy), the middle brother, has no intention of giving Rakes any of profits. The youngest brother, Jack (LaBeouf), is initially the introverted brother who looks up to his older siblings. Forrest is the brains of the operation; he is in charge and he is feared by many. The oldest brother is Howard (Jason Clarke) who always seems to have a bottle in his hand and gets the dirty work done.This film is very depressing, at times quite dark, and extremely violent. There is some comic relief every now and then at the appropriate moments, but that didn't stop me from tearing up during the heart wrenching scenes.The leads' performances were all superb and believable. It is clear that director John Hillcoat greatly focused on character development. The audience genuinely feels relieved when something good happens to the brothers and helpless when something bad happens to them. The audience actually cares about the characters.I definitely recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a crime/drama film with some action and some gore. I also recommend it to those who appreciate stylish films. I give ""Lawless"" an 8 out of 10.",Lawless
211,omorg-pub,one of the best,10,2 July 2015,"i suppose everyone's got their preferences, but i can't believe anyone gives this film anything but a 10. Tom Hardy and Guy Pearce deliver stand-out performances. Shia is in top form. The story is incredible, the characters have human depth (based as much on context as depiction), even more so because it's based on real events that include a gritty close-up of the best and worst of prohibition-era country culture--country as in rural Appalachia, not country and western. Both a period and culture I find fascinating, engaging, and often laudable (both in this film and in real life). Allowing from dramatic embellishment, this is a representation of how life was once truly lived from the roots up, without a safety net, with only integrity and courage and family (or the lack thereof) to back you up.",Lawless
212,kivancozsahin,Tom Hardy-Guy Pearce,7,19 January 2013,"Ordinary story about the fight between the state authority and the outlaw. What makes this movie worth of seeing is absolutely Tom Hardy and Guy Pearce. Those who have seen the latest Batman movie will remember how powerful Tom Hardy's Bane was. He proves to be a perfect match for the character Forrest in this movie and gives Forrest a distinguished personality as much as most actors can not. This holds true for Guy Pearce, transforming an average officer into a charismatic, lunatic, merciless character. Even Gary Oldman lags behind these two guys. To conclude, go and see if you like to see good acting, save your money if you're interested in seeing an original story.",Lawless
213,UberGoober1411,Tom Hardy solidifies himself as the baddest badass of our time,7,7 October 2012,"I'll be blunt, I came into this film with low expectations. Shia LeBouf was never my favorite actor, apart from when he played Stanley Yelnats in Holes (even if he was badly mis-cast). I was getting ready to hear him yell things towards something past the audience and watch him force himself to cry, which is one of the ugliest things I have ever seen. Apart from my low expectations, I kept an open mind and, let me say, I was pleasantly surprised.The basic premise of Lawless tells a story about a family of country bootleggers in Franklin, a small village somewhere hear Chicago. As prohibition came to fruition, the law started buckling down. Enter Guy Pearce, the Special-Super Deputy in charge of seeing over the shutting down of all stills and confiscation of all moonshine out of Franklin. What follows is an account of the Bounderant family taking a stand for their own product and going against the law.The acting in this movie is quite good, with the performance of Gary Oldman being short but meaningful. Guy Pearce makes a really good bad guy, almost Jude Law-esque from Road to Perdition. Shia holds his own and the supporting cast isn't bad, but Tom Hardy steals the show as the ""invincible"" Forrest Bounderant. As the title suggests, Forrest is a badass in this film. I can't go into details for fear of disclosing spoilers, but just know that Hardy once again makes us fall in movie-love with his character.The story is quite good, giving the audience a different look to the bootlegging scene. The HBO show Boardwalk Empire provides an inside look at upper-class bootlegging while Lawless takes us into where the alcohol originates: in the country. There are twists and turns in the plot and the ending wraps everything up nicely.All-in-all I'd recommend this movie. It's a solid all-around film, and although it seems to drag out sometimes there's plenty of action to boot.+3 for Tom Hardy+3 for story-telling+1 for supporting cast",Lawless
214,natcarr-74-27114,Good prohibition era outlaw movie,9,20 January 2015,"This movie has a decent plot and the actors do a great job of bringing the story to life. Lawless nails the Bonnie and Clyde / Butch and Sundance / Thunderbolt and Lightfoot vibe where you root for the bad guys. I almost fell into the trap of calling it a gangster movie, but it isn't really. its more about people fighting for their way of life, even if its a shady way of life. They are on a collision with society, which is a form of bondage in its way. Forcing you to do things for nothing while the rich get richer. In this case Guy Pearse' amazingly evil law man is out to intimidate our heroes into paying the crooked establishment protection money to look the other way. Pearse is brilliant. I really hated his character and the final shoot out is both enthralling and frustrating at the same time, I just wanted Guy's character to die as painfully as possible. That's the mark of a good movie. The movie is extremely bloody but as a horror fan I lapped it up and the subject matter was violent anyway so why pull punches? it certainly helped drive home the horror of the injuries which was all the more powerful when it was someone you liked getting hurt, it also really helped get you angry with the villains. I really enjoyed the film, there were no plot issues where a character would do something out of keeping with their character. The film isn;t isn't the Untouchables or Gangster Squad, its a outlaw western in its way. its about a group of brothers doing what they've always done and then ""Progress"" tries to steamroller the top of them with violent consequences. The outlaws are the good guys here. its a film to inspire the working classes go break out of the 9-5 grind and do something and make money. working to 67 for a measily 4K / year pension is a mug's game. Metaphorically build a still and brew that moonshine. ;)",Lawless

Great writing, great acting, great story and stunning cinematography. Voting a 7 for this film was easy and an unusually high rating for me. There were two things that kept me from enjoying it 100%. The violence was way over done and too graphic; it seems as though Hollywood is in some sort of competition to see who can create the most graphic violence as each movie gets worse and worse. Lastly, will someone tell me what the purpose was of having the naked girl in Floyd Banner's hotel room? It was totally unnecessary and just reinforces my belief that Hollywood producers feel it absolutely necessary to have a naked woman in their movie for no other reason than to satisfy teenage boys libido.",Lawless

And it was, but only a little bit.",7,12 September 2012,"Lawless has a great cast - Shia LaBeouf, Tom Hardy, Gary Oldman, Guy Pearce. - And a great story about three brother's growing up in Depression- era Virginia and based on a true story. The three brother's are bootleggers, but when a special deputy and other police figures want a cut of their action, their whole world turns upside down. Everything seemed too good to be true. The cast, the story, everything. And it was, but only a little bit. The film was great, very enjoyable to watch, great acting from everyone involved. But the film, I felt, lacked something. I didn't feel connected to any of the characters, as in they felt too two-dimensional. I didn't really feel how they felt at certain points and it should have showed the brotherhood more instead of opting for blood and violence. I think the film needed to be more humorous, because it needed something to ease the tension between those bloody scenes and I think that was it. Shia LaBeouf was very good and Tom Hardy was even better. Even the smaller roles like Gary Oldman's character were acted well. I think it spent too much time on the whole romance aspect of it and it should have laid off of that a bit more. But the acting was great from everyone and it was an enjoyable time at the cinema. It is a good film, but didn't live up to the expectations I had. A solid 7/10.",Lawless

His slow, lackadaisical manner in this movie is so much like Southern ""boys"", then and now. No, I am not exactly a Southern Boy, but I served with a number of them in the Military. I am a transplanted Lower Indiana boy, in the East.This movie will get my third viewing, having finished watching it 2x already. The comment by ""WildBullWriter"" is spot on: Southern rural hill people. Unless one understands the guts and glory of the hard-scrubbed rural folk across our land in the 1900s through WWII, they will not understand how historical fiction speaks to historical reality in this film.Guy Pearce as Charlie Rakes is superb in his role as a Chicago ""gangsta"".

220,bRAdY-01,A modern Gangster classic of good old boy bootleggers,9,25 May 2012,"An American classic tale of the stubborn humble country folk bootleggers resisting corrupt city politicians and the mob. I watched this film at the Cannes as a filmmaker myself I was attending the festival to screen my own film. All the stars turned up to support the film and attended the main evening screening including Nick Cave (the main man behind the scenes for screenplay and score). The film received a rapturous applause after the screening, it is after all a classic modern gangster tale of good-old-boys moon-shiners going up against the mob when they refuse to tow the line and pay protection money to gangsters working for the local corrupt elected official. A family of three brothers, the elder two Tom Hardy and Jason Clarke play Forrest and Howard Bondurant, legendary local hard men and indestructible war hero, their younger sibling Shia LaBeouf plays Jack Bondurant a young man trying desperately to live up to and gain respect from his older brothers. When gangsters fronted by Guy Pearce as Special Agent Charlie Rakes (as an eccentric very scary villain) comes to town, with the assistance of the local constabulary, the offer is made to give up a piece of their action making moon-shine in the nearby hills or to feel the wrath of the law. The brothers are set in their ways, bend down to no man and a confrontation is in the offing. Without giving too much away, Jessica Chastain as Maggie turns up in town having escaped from cruel violent men in the city, she is given a job by Forrest and a very slow romance begins, she is smouldering, sassy and the only strong woman in the film. Yes...this is a boys movie, the scenes of brutal violence will repulse a female audience, but then again they will probably turn up in droves to watch La Beouf turn out a strong assured well developed leading man's performance. Jason Clarke as Howard is strong and as always totally believable, though it is perhaps for Hardy's remarkable modern John Wayne homage performance that the film will most likely be remembered, for he uses all John Wayne's classic acting tips ""Say less, say it low and say it slow"", enabling Hardy to once again turn out a remarkably memorable star building performance that will both melt the ladies hearts and make him the envy of every young tough man wanting to make a name for himself as a hard man leader type. Gary Oldman appears briefly in a couple of memorable scenes, as always understated and highly memorable, he plays his part in building the legend of the Bondurant brothers, but I only wish that his character had been given a bigger part in the story. The golden team that made The Proposition (2005)are re-united, John Hillcoat doing a great job of Directing once more, and both the script and fabulous country Bluegrass and bluesy score, being provided by the music legend in real life Nick Cave. Though the critics Jury at the Cannes film festival undeservedly did not vote for the film favourably (most probably because they did not like to see the three anti-heroes law breakers prevail against the police, corrupt though they were), it is more likely that at an art-house festival the reviews took exception that they were forced to watch and review a main stream film. Whilst The Proposition was an art-house hit Lawless will have undoubtedly enjoy much wider distribution and be remembered as a modern gangster classic. The original book was written by Jake's very own grandson, brought up on the true story, if most probably slightly exaggerated over repeated retelling though the ages. The film, thoroughly enjoyable and very highly recommended.",Lawless
221,foleymichael60,Lawless still,8,15 September 2012,I guess its time for me to admit I really like this movie. It has about anything in it I like about gangster flicks. Especially white people! Who by the way can box to.Do you really want to be known as someone who knows only peaceful resolution for life's problems when there is so much violence in this world? So much take at any cost! Like the bastard's who gave us prohibition and made an obscene fortune on gasoline while ethanol went by the wayside.This is a good screenplay by Nick Cave? Well it is a good screenplay. (Who's Nick Cave?)I didn't see enough of Gary Oldman either! I have liked his work since I think I first saw him as Dracula. And Tom Hardy gives a good turn here as does the rest of the cast.There is something to be learned from this period of history that I think is particularly urgent. Can we really let other people run things? Like tell us how much soda we can drink or talk on the phone while driving and then have some filthy shitty asshole thug (in LA) slam our women to the ground.For Christ sake!Well pigs love the sty I guess!There is one scene in this film that I didn't see the need for and probably isn't in the book. Guess!The director John Hillcoat did a excellent job interpreting the screenplay and brought it to the screen with some artful insight.The big shootout needed Tommy guns though to make it more exciting.,Lawless
222,RockoutGlockout117,A rousing tale of moonshine and brass knuckles,7,4 September 2012,"Realistically you already know what this movie is about. Dudes making moonshine in the country who get in trouble with some guys who for one reason or another wind up shooting/beating them up and vice versa. While that is an accurate description ""Lawless"" is something a bit more than that, of course it has all that stuff shooting,killing, and a naked Jessica Chastain to boot but that's not the point of the film.The point of the film is the struggle of Jack Bondurant(Shia Labeouf) I'm not a particular fan of the actor although I don't detest him like many do, I've found him to be good at what he does, namely a humorous Young Adult who runs from giant robots, and while Shia doesn't have a terribly large range of acting ability I find him to deliver Solid performances, and Lawless is another such example. He delivers well the tale and journey of Jack who at the beginning of the film cant even bring himself to kill a Pig, but by the end, well lets just say things are a bit different, and it is all done very well.Of course Shia isn't the only actor in the film Tom Hardy who most people will recognize as Bane(though cool people will recognize him as Tommy) also appears, as does Gary Oldman the aforementioned Jessica Chastain and that girl from ""Alice In Wonderland"" and they all deliver solid performances considering what the performances called for. One my few complaints is that Hardy's character really doesn't have much range(though that could be said about all the characters) he spends most of his time mumbling in a thick accent and doing ""I'm in charge"" kind of stuff. Gary Oldman's character is also a disappointment as while he was advertised in the film's commercials he appears in it for under 15 minutes. Ironically in the opening credits when listing the actors it says ""And Guy Pearce"" when it should say ""And Gary Oldman"" considering Pearce's character is in the film for a much more significant role than Oldman's.So if everything is so average about this film why did I rate it an 7/10? Well its hard to say it has a certain Rough, Old feel but seen in a new way that benefits the material,though honestly only two scenes really standout those being The Church Scene and The Standoff At The Bridge. But nonetheless ""Lawless"" manages to go on, it inhabits the imagination. And I expect it will for a good while. It is a tale that just for lack of a better term has what it takes.",Lawless

Based on a true story, this movie follows 3 brothers as they fight for their position and respect in the illegal business.Few actors bring a high level of intensity to the character they play as Tom Hardy does and for his role as Forrest Bondurant, it's no let down. Shia LaBouf is too hokey an actor to take seriously in his role and tended to undersell some scenes due to a lack of appropriate or sincere expression and others like when he was getting a beat down by Special Deputy Charley Rakes couldn't oversell the scene more unless he did actual cartwheels after getting hit. The rest of the cast gave a quality performance and overall this movie is an interesting and exciting film to see.",Lawless
224,lucyrichards27,"A violent, funny and moving tale of Moonshiners.",10,30 September 2012,"Personally, I only really like to watch horror movies but when I saw the trailer for this, I HAD to see this. The main line up was amazing - Tom Hardy is brilliant usually and was in this movie, portraying a funny yet strong character. Shia was equally as good; unexpectedly in all honesty. I've never watched a movie with Jess Chastain/Guy Pearce in so I didn't have a prior opinion of them to build on. I pretty much hated Guy as he was the villain! I really wanted him to die!.My boyfriend was thrilled to find out that this movie was based on a tale of true moonshiners, seeing as he was addicted to the documentary series 'Moonshiners' when it was on TV. I was also glad to find out it ACTUALLY WAS based on a true story. I've grown tired of films saying they are based on a true story when they are clearly not. It puts me off straight away. There was no putting me off this one - I saw it twice in the cinema!. The acting was great, the characters were great, the soundtrack was great and it definitely deserves a 10/10 :) I was shocked when I saw it only got 7ish/10.The one thing I will say about this movie is that it's not good for people that dislike violence in movies. The movie features some pretty hardcore scenes in which Tom Hardy's throat gets slit, and Shia gets beat up badly. Luckily, that stuff doesn't really bother me. It's also a very long movie; about 2 1/2 hours long. Every second is filled with action, humour, love, and violence - I didn't mind the length.I'd recommend this movie for lovers of Gangsters, Moonshiners, violence, Tom Hardy, and even Western culture.

225,jmydgeek,ugh - don't waste your time. Straight to cable caliber acting and direction,2,10 December 2013,"The performances are terrible. Shia theBeef is the same guy he was in Transformers. If a still turned into a Decepticon I would not have been surprised, but probably would have been more entertained. Guy Pearce was OK as the creepy guy, but compared to his other work it seems like they took the 4th best take of every scene. Gary Oldman was pretty decent, the only one I forgot even for a second was acting. Jessica Chastain was not convincing at all.The story was terrible, the ending utterly unbelievable. You can't shoot cops - even corrupt cops - and expect to stay out of the electric chair. They shot a *lot* of cops, who seemed to apologize for getting in the way of the bullets. That ain't how it works, folks, even if you are tired of writing the screenplay.",Lawless
226,bruce-moreorless,Lawless is pointless,6,18 October 2012,"Lawless is a potentially good film marred by a fire and brimstone script and pointless violence that teeters on the cartoonish and downright ludicrous.I've been a fan of Hillcoat's earlier work (The Proposition, The Road). Nick Cave's screenplay for The Proposition hit just the right balance of Old Testament vengeance and outback myth. Hillcoat's interpretation of Cormac McCarthy's The Road also nicely balanced horror and humanism. In Lawless, however, both Cave and Hillcoat have gone over the top. Consequently, the film descends into parody. In the climatic screens it even becomes ridiculous. And the culprit? That would be violence. Unbelievable violence. Violence that sees bad guys who are almost beaten to death recover within what seems to be mere minutes and exact terrible revenge on the film's ""hero"" and his girl. Violence that sees the ""hero's"" brother repeatedly and viciously struck in the head by the psychopathic deputy only to appear in the next scenes with barely a bruise or swelling and definitely no broken teeth. Violence that has no consequence, that bears little or no resemblance to reality.Now I'm not against violence in films, but make it real for goodness sake. Filmmakers like Hillcoat and Cave really should get some firsthand experience of the effects of extreme violence on body and soul before making movies like Lawless that purport to be realistic and based on ""a true story"" but which are in fact total fantasies. Make it real guys. Make it really real.",Lawless

228,Blooner,A brutally gritty and ballsy movie,9,21 January 2013,"Review originally posted on InspirationRation.com - Lawless is a brutally gritty movie situated in the 1920s. The story follows the three brothers Forrest, Howard and Jack Bondurant; Played by Tom Hardy, Jason Clarke, and Shia LaBeouf respectively. The Bondurant brothers are successful bootleggers during the prohibition, selling their alcoholic wares locally. They are feared throughout the county, and the rumour that they might be invincible keeps the local police off their backs. However, when a new Special Deputy comes in from Chicago, troubles arise This trouble comes with a substantial amount of violence, as can be expected when outlaws, gangsters and police start clashing. Lawless presents this violence in a very brutal, yet honest way. There are no over the top explosions or hand-to-hand combat scenes, just men kicking the living daylight out of other men while they're down. Harsh visuals that are a breath of fresh air after all the recent Michael Bay-inspired action flicks.Lawless is very good at interspersing this violence with short bursts of humour, particularly regarding the legend of the Bondurant brothers' indestructability. Tom Hardy's character also generates some laughs, with comedic grunts reminiscent of Adam Baldwin.The movie's soundtrack is especially good as well. This might have something to do with the fact that Nick Cave, who provided the screenplay, also created the soundtrack. Something which specifically feeds back into the 'honest' action in the movie is that Lawless utilizes quiet moments very effectively. Fight scenes are often not accompanied by any music at all, which adds to the reality and harshness of that scene. Very ballsy. (There's a pun here you only get if you've seen the movie) I really enjoyed Lawless, but I do have a point of critique. The storyline of Maggie Beauford, the love interest for Forrest Bondurant, does not really add anything at all to the overall effect of the movie. It's only purpose seems to be to add some additional female presence and sex to the movie. I have no quarrels with that at all, but it could have been better integrated into the main storyline somewhat. As it stands any character development from the interactions with her are inconsequential for the flow of the movie. Jessica Chastain acts the part well, and it in no way diminishes from the quality of the movie, but it just seems somewhat detached from the goal of the movie.I highly recommend you go see Lawless, and enjoy the brutal goings-on in what was once described as the ""wettest county in the world"". - review originally posted on InspirationRation.com",Lawless

Tom Hardy is also exceptional,some other actors could have gone over top with this role,but he keeps it so low key,and it works. Dane DeHaan,who was in Chronicle,the best sci fi film in ages,is also very good in the small,but pivotal role of cricket.i am very impressed with this young actor,i think and hope he is going to be a name to look out for in the future,i will certainly be watching his next few films.Another pleasant surprise for me,was the screenplay,written by Nick Cave.Looking forward to whatever his next screenplay will be. I was surprised at the 18 certificate it has been given.yes there are quite a few blood spurts,but the violence is definitely not over the top considering the violent tale that is being told.it is shame the certificate is so high because it will probably put a lot of people off watching what is a very good story.

I consider myself a big-time movie buff, and own well over 600 movies. With that being said, Lawless has to be one of the best movies I have seen. Looking at the other reviews about this movie just make me wonder what people want out of movies. Some people called this movie ""slow"" or said it ""missed the mark."" Lawless is truly a movie that gives you everything you could want in a crime/gangster(ish) movie. Not only does Lawless have an all-star cast, everyone delivers. Guy Pearce gives one of his best performances of his career. Yes, his performance rivals that of Memento. I could go on and on about this movie, but I think I will keep it simple and give out grades for every category I can think of.

231,victoriasimon86,fun and entertaining,8,14 August 2013,"Lawless (2012) Tom Hardy and Shia LaBeouf play two out of the three bootlegging brothers in the country side of Virginia during Prohibition. This is a violent film and since we have Chicago cops involved everything is guns, murder and gore. I don't usually love violent films but it was entertaining. Guy Pierce is as creepy and low as ever as the obsessive and sadistic Chicago fed. Gary Oldman also gives us his crazy antics that he was known for in his earlier days and has an amazing make-up job. Jessica Chastain plays one of two female roles and provides color to an otherwise drab and dirty backdrop. Mia Wasikowska plays the other female role as the innocent but witty romantic interest of Shia LaBeouf's character. I like the movie because Tom Hardy and Shia are really gearing up serious manliness here. They are fearless. Tom Hardy's character is quiet and private until you mess with him. Shia is brave and cocky and wont let anyone or anything get in his way when he decides to make deals with the family moonshine that could cost him his life at every turn.

The acting was wooden (except for Guy Pearce who was more like a cartoon character), it was stop-and-go pacing meaning that there were too many pointless scenes, and it took too much time for too little information. I feel like this movie started out with a good script with possibly creative ideas for execution, but then good ole Hollywood interfered and turned it into this. There were two romances in it that had nothing to do with anything. There was a scene where it is implied that something traumatic happens to one of the female characters; it was never addressed again. Also, the villain barely had a motivation for committing the acts that he did. All in all, it was not a terrible movie, but it could have been a whole lot better.",Lawless
234,ciera-larose,"""Lawless"" is a film based on the true story of the Bondurant brothers whose moonshine business is threatened.",8,22 April 2013,"""Lawless"" is a film based on the true story of the Bondurant brothers. The movie is set in Franklin county Virginia during the depression era. It follows the three Bondurant brothers whose moonshine or ""bootlegging"" business is threatened by some new members of authority who are trying to secure a cut of the brothers' profits . The film demonstrated a few flaws in its realistic portrayal of the depression era. There were a few scenes that didn't seem to mesh well with the time period, such as the paved roads for example. However the acting really helped to drive the time period home.The three Bondurant brothers were portrayed by Tom Hardy, Jason Clarke and Shia LaBoeuf. Hardy played Forrest, he eldest of the brothers and the resident ""badass"" of the group. He nailed his character in my opinion. The accent he spoke in was perfect for the role and he genuinely seemed like someone you should fear. Jason Clarke played Howard, the middle Bondurant brother and the mildly crazy alcoholic. He also did an excellent job with his character. He always seemed to have his brothers' back, always willing to get his hands dirty and although he didn't display much emotion, you genuinely believed that he loved his brothers. However, the Bodurant brother that stole the show in my opinion was Jack as portrayed by Shia LaBoeuf. Throughout the movie we watch LaBoeuf's character transform from a relatively shy young man into a power player in the business and a force to be reckoned with. His evolution as a character was thoroughly entertaining and truly riveting. I was pleased to see the relationships between his character and those of his fellow cast mates develop. Cricket Pâté, played by Dane DeHaan was essentially an honorary Bondurant brother. He was responsible for adjusting and perfecting their moonshine, going on ride alongside with Jack and then maintaining the ""distillery"". He did an excellent job portraying the sweet, simple boy. The members of ""the law"" we're also perfectly cast. Guy Pearce portrayed his character Charlie Rakes to a tee. He was over the top and beyond creepy and really just the quintessential sleazy bad cop. Gary Oldman also did an excellent job with his character Floyd Banner. He was quite gritty and over the top. Although there were several other characters that I found to be relatively useless in regards to the development of the story. For instance, Maggie Beauford and Bertha Minnix played by Jessica Chastain and Mia Wasikowska respectively were basically used solely as love interests to explain the ""happy, they had a bunch of kids and lived happily ever after, ending"". Well I guess they served their purpose on that aspect, but as for the development of the rest of the story line throughout the movie, there were really only used in filler scenes. In conclusion, this movie was well done in regards to story, cinematography (save for a few small issues) and acting. In my opinion, you should definitely give it a go.",Lawless
235,Pete_198594,A very very poor film,1,18 January 2013,"Im sorry but if you consider this film to have been 'good' or 'enjoyable' then you probably should consider not writing reviews on film. The film was truly awful, it was incredibly dull and had an incredibly cheap feel to it. At times I heard myself groaning at just how bad certain scenes were and almost laughed when the two males that Tom Hardy dispatched with a knuckle duster, one whose throat was crushed, the other knocked out cold miraculously were able to get up, grinning and unharmed and then proceed to cut Hardys characters throat?? As for Gary Oldmans role in the film Im at a loss? Friend of the director possibly? Guy Pearces character was so outlandish and out of place in the film that it was embarrassing to watch. The final shoot-out scene was really the last straw for me, Hardys character having just been shot in the shoulder reloads his pistol and walks menacingly towards Pearce, teeth gritted, pistol aimed straight at Pearce and yet miraculously Pearce manages to draw his own gun and shoot Hardy god knows how many times without Hardy getting a shot off? None of it seems believable to the viewer, its as if the director thought he would get a great cast and then see if he could make a film around them? Anyway the jokes on me as I paid to watch this rubbish..gutted.",Lawless
236,MikeyBoomBoom,"Frustrating, had real potential but ends up failing hard",4,25 December 2017,"This could have been such a great film, but a combination of factors made it fall over.The prohibition era is well trodden in film but as far as I can recall I've never seen this aspect of it explored. Then you've got Tom Hardy, Guy Pearce, Gary Oldman, arguably three of the best actors around. This should have added up to a winning combo, at the very least better than average. 
Instead we get an uneven mess of storytelling, some terrible dialogue, uneven pacing and way, way WAY too much Shia. Oh my gosh that guy sucks and it felt like he was in every scene.
Tom Hardy has a tendency to a mumbling, grunting acting style, which a lot of people don't like, but personally I love the guy and found myself eagerly waiting for more of his scenes. Instead we get Shia, Shia, and more Shia. While Tom gets to lurk in t he background fobbed off with a tacked on love story. What were they thinking?
There are some flashes of brilliance. The throat cutting scene. Guy Pearce's compelling presence. The fabulously haunting church music (in a scene once again ruined by Shia) which make this experience all the more frustrating. It could have been so good.",Lawless
237,Joshwahr,A pitch perfect crime drama,8,11 October 2012,"Lawless is based on the true story of the three Bondurant brothers from Franklin County, Virginia, who ran an illegal moonshine business during the times of prohibition in America. Tom Hardy stars as the alpha male lead brother, Forrest Bondurant, and brings an incredible, yet subtle performance compared to his more recent roles. Forrest is a strong character who is not afraid to throw his weight around, for example when he crushes a bad guy's larynx with a single punch, but still carries a sense of humanity in his character when falling for Maggie (Jessica Chastain) and when caring for his two brothers. Hardy's little grunts also provide many a comedic point throughout the film, which had the audience in fits of laughter on many occasions. Shia LaBeouf stars as the central character, Jack Bondurant, bringing a great performance to the screen, finally starting to break free of the stereotype he seems to have dug himself into with the Transformers series. Guy Pearce's villain, Charlie Rakes, is a federal agent with little morals or boundaries. Pearce looks incredibly creepy without eyebrows, for whatever reason this is it's not made clear, but it looks freakin' sinister. Eyebrows aside, Pearce's performance is noteworthy and he covers up his Aussie accent incredibly well. Come to think of it, the cast came from various countries – Pearce from Australia, Hardy and Gary Oldman both from England – and they cover up their accents well with the ye'olden Virginian accent. The story is superbly written by Nick Cave, whom I had no idea was a screenwriter, with fantastic action sequences, most notably the scene where Rakes (Peace), raids the Bondurants' stills, blowing them to kingdom come with an almighty explosion. This action is intertwined with great dialogue and some real heart to the central characters. The musical score, also done by Nick Cave, was marvellous and hit every note perfectly. I haven't heard a score which affected me so deeply for quite some time.Overall Lawless was a fantastic film, leaving little to be desired when leaving the cinema.8/10.To see the original review and much more, go to http://joshwahr.com/",Lawless

239,roblipton-99448,"An ordinary, okay, 6/10 movie made much better by Tom Hardy",8,6 December 2016,"This was my first Tom Hardy experience, he's truly a revelation, he took a normal role and transformed it. He is the new Daniel Day Lewis, his intensity and strangeness infuses every scene he's in, he changes the cadence and meaning of most things in the movie. Weirdly, I felt like I had always seen him, like a song you really like but have never heard before and to be clear, this is not some fanboy thing - his walk, how he entered a scene, how he responds to other characters, he seems larger than life and he was acting with some pretty capable people. The music in the movie was great too, the movie itself was pretty black and white routine but worth the price of admission. Hardy's subsequent work on the Revenant, (which I hated) was also amazing as was his work on Mad Max. In the latter, he worked so well with Cherlize Theron who also is a fearless actor and ironically or maybe because of Hardy's intensity, she refused to have anything to do with him off the set. He's the real thing, when you see such talent, even if you know nothing about acting you realize you are in the presence of genius.",Lawless

The cast looked strong, Hardy and Pearce can seldom do wrong in my mind, maybe with an exception of Pearce's recent space adventure and the story looked engaging, but wow was I wrong.Over long and to be honest, just plain boring in places its a waste of great acting talent. Hardy does play his role well but then again, his character was not that interesting. Pearce, for me, stole the film.His borderline, psycho, maybe gay or bi-sexual creep ( he goes mad at the word ""Nanc"" ) is powerful and engaging. You will notice I have not mentioned LaBeouf, thats because he's really not worth mentioning. Thinking that LaBeouf can pull off being mean and nasty is a bit like being threatened by a grumpy Koala bear.

I'm not sure that that storyline needs to be told so often, I personally wish that there were different ways to tell a story, I'm no expert in storytelling, so I can't condemn a film's storyline for being unoriginal, but in this case the whole context seemed to stick out like the scabbed hangnail of a thumb if you know what I mean.

This movie has a great vibe to it, reminds me of ""A History of Violence"". Probably due to the violence always under the surface and when it comes out it is real and unflinching. All violence should be shown as this and never sugar coated, we would perhaps a little less violent when we know the true consequences. I am getting off topic but I did think that part was done realistically and correctly.I really like Tom Hardy in this, I am becoming a big fan of his. All acting was great.

243,joshey_kun19,Wasn't this supposed to be one of the more epic movies of the year?,5,8 September 2012,"I walked into the theater with some friends hoping to see an amazing movie with amazing performances by the actors. What I got wasn't exactly what I was hoping for. Lawless lacks too much for it to be top of my list. But of course, it isn't the worst movie I have ever seen.Here's the thing, if you're hoping to see an epic movie that's deep, with a great storyline, and just as amazing characters, this might not be the movie for you. This film has a storyline, but they try to fill the time with scenes and side stories that really didn't need to be placed into the film. The story wasn't really deep at all. It lacked heart, and sometimes, intellect. Well, at least their was a plot line.The performance of the actors was actually quite dull and not too impressive. After seeing The Dark Knight Rises, I had high hopes for Tom Hardy in this film. Too bad his character was shallow and emotionless. I never really felt for his character at all, and neither for his brother Howard. By the end of the movie, I really didn't care whether they lived or died. The best performance was Shia Labeouf (whom I really don't care much for anyway). He was the only true human character I could ever feel something for. The only one I could connect too. So he was pretty much the only one I liked, despite the fact that his character was also pretty stupid sometimes. It's also a shame that such a great actor like Gary Oldman had such a tiny part in the film. And I don't know why Guy Pearce thought he could seem so tough by lowering his voice at times, and sounding like a lunatic.The action sequences were decent, but not mesmerizing in any way. I'm glad there was a little though. Really not as epic as I was expecting. I really wasn't pulled into the film at all. It was just stuff flashing before my eyes. And some of it was pretty pointless. It seems that people are just playing favorites. They think Tom Hardy did so amazing because they love him and would like any movie he's in. Shia Labeouf fans would be the same. But when it came to acting performance, Shia stole the show. So I'm glad the creators of the film made his character more believable.All in all, there really isn't really all the much to say about this film other than it lacks heart, conviction, great performances and characters, all the epicness a lot were hoping to see, and it was just too shallow. But then again, it did have a little there, so that is why it really isn't too terrible of a film, and definitely not the worst I have seen. Because there really are worse films out there than this.",Lawless
244,RehashCritics,Why Lawless Falls Short of Greatness,6,29 August 2012,"Ike: I am going to catch grief for this one, but wow was I left needing more. Lawless had such opportunity, but was broken by slow paced unprogressive scenes, anti-climatic everything, and spotty character inclusion. The biggest blunder was visionary direction and the greatness was in the strong believable acting.It can never be the acting that gets full blame for falling short, you have to go higher. Directors have responsibility of piecing the story and coaching the actors into greatness, and when the ball gets dropped on accountability and patience the movie crumbles. John Hillcoat, director, slipped up a bit.John directed Shia in a way that kept us from being emotionally attached to Shia LaBeouf's character. Shia was fantastical in his acting, but was mildly unlikable. Although he was believable, I wanted no part in the rest of his story. If the movie centers around a character with growing pains, you have to connect to him. This was not accomplished.Tom Hardy, brother Forrest Bondurant, acted incredibly well and in a fashion that can't go ignored. Although his role was easier than Shia's he saved the movie from becoming bubble gum. His realistic portrayal of an old fashion bad ass gave Lawless the muscle it needed to be taken seriously. But it takes the whole team to make a movie legendary.Remember seeing several scenes of Gary Oldman being a serious gangster in the trailer for Lawless. Whelp, this is all you get. The story gets heavy when Gary makes an appearance as Floyd Banner, a bigger badder gangster. And thats it Not enough Gary for what the movie needed.Guy Pearce, known as cynical Special Agent Charlie Rakes, make his presence known as the outsider bad guy. Guy Pearce didn't hold back in playing the role of this nasty villain. This piece of Lawless added the juice. But even with this great line-up I felt cheated from seeing what I thought would be greatness.These 5 reasons keep Lawless from greatness.1. I didn't like Shia's character, therefore I could not connect with him.2. Connecting all the characters with the emotional pain of loss or extreme life happenings was nowhere to be found. I mean nowhere!3. Long drawn out scenes desperately needed to depict the depression's impact, not bland scenery and traveling.4. Most of the impact scenes were like weak left jabs.5. The ending***I can't blame the actors, they were all great. I blame both the director and the flippin chatty Kathies behind me not shutting up.

245,firashaidar66,A gangster western,7,2 February 2013,"moviestoenjoy.wordpress.comIf this movie wasn't based on a true story, I probably would have given it a 4/10. But since it's a movie similar to many others, Lawless had to give us something more, and that would be its attention to the 1930s details.It's in fact a true story, the tale of the bootlegging Bondurant brothers (played by Hardy, Labeouf, and Jason Clarke) during the 1930s. Unlike HBO's Boardwalk Empire, which gives us an inside look at upper- class bootlegging, Lawless takes us into where the alcohol originates: in the country. The story isn't that bad, giving the audience a different look to the bootlegging scene. But, you don't really know where the movie's going until it's there, which, I guess, is the storyline's only con.Director John Hillcoat does a really good job in this film. The acting was in fact pretty good, with Shia Labeouf giving us a good performance, and a short but meaningful appearance by Gary Oldman. Guy Pearce delivers us the bad guy that everyone will hate. But, Tom Hardy's performance was better than both. Hardy plays the invincible Forrest Bondurant, proving that he was born to play the role of the badass. The supporting cast also did a good job, giving us a movie with a good overall performance.There's something about a gangster movie set in the atmosphere of a western that would attract a lot of curious watchers. The movie is in fact good and enjoyable. Yet, a slightly better storyline would have risen the movie to be a brilliant one.",Lawless

249,hollybellekeating,yeah..,7,4 December 2012,"Nick Cave's Lawless contains every variable for a fantastic movie: Tom Hardy, a rich story, and a dusty, cinematic setting. Based on Matt Bondurant's novel The Wettest Country in the World, we follow the three Bondurant brothers in 1930's Virginia as they strive to succeed in the Prohibition era. In the town of Franklin, the law is over-run by the bootlegging gang of Forest Bondurant (Hardy). He and his brothers, the intimidating Howard (Jason Clarke) and timid Jack (Shia LaBeouf) brew and sell their Moonshine ale, with the crippled mechanic Cricket (Dane DeHaan), to surrounding counties. But when the new, corrupt deputy Charles Rakes (Guy Pierce) and the authorities are brought in to shut them down and take a slice of their profits, the real war begins.We are introduced to the story as boys, and each Bondurant brother has their roles distinguished in the cruel shooting of an innocent pig. The story develops and continues as adults, and Forest is acknowledged as the leader of Franklin, controlling the town with fear. We see from many scenes throughout the film, he is brutally and unmerciful towards anyone who gets in the way. But when he is injured due to one of Rake's men, animosity escalates and Jack decides that it's his turn to take charge.I realize why it is so dangerous to hype up a movie simply based on its cast members. With big names like Tom Hardy and Jessica Chastain, it's hard not to get excited. But unfortunately for Lawless, it is utterly flawed. The setting is beautiful in a minimalist way; it captures the sand-in-every-crevice skin and weathered faces excellently. Hillcoat's directing can be hit or miss; he doesn't explain anything but the core idea. For example, he only glances at the segregation, which is refreshing, but ignores key characters like Howard Bondurant, depicting him as a pointless, violent drunk.Looking at the acting, you could say Lawless would deserve more credit; the cast portray 30's gangsters believably. Hardy took the approach of incoherent grunting and an emotionless, cruel facade, whilst LaBoeuf went for the cocky, American-Dream boy. But as the gore and the grit came, the actors excelled. In one particular scene, when Jack is given some bad news, LaBoeuf opens up and lets his character's, and his own raw, emotional turmoil shine through the cracks. Altogether, the film is quite good. The love interests aren't really well developed and it lacks layers in the script. The viewer is often left in the dark in the story's ambiguous turnings and concentrates on the gore and darkness of crime, as seen with Pierce's manic villain. To be honest, the idea of Lawless was better than the reality.",Lawless
250,John_the_Lamp,'Lawless' is a slow burner with a respectable boom,8,2 September 2012,"In 1931, moonshining is business with its perks and drawbacks. And the Bondurant boys in Franklin County have found their way around the drawbacks. But after Special Deputy Rakes (Pearce) comes to town, there's a new law to follow. Forrest (Hardy), Jack (Labeouf), and Howard (Clarke) now have to tippy toe their way around the law. But if anyone slips up, they're as good as gone (other than the immortal Forrest). Forrest has an interesting story. He survived the war and the flu and always has the aura surrounding him as being untouchable. And when he talks, you know he never minces words. Mainly because his longest sentence is five words. I've heard a lot of people not liking Hardy's voice and accent, but I think it really goes with the character. It sounds like he's almost swallowing his voice because how much he hates speaking. But the best Bondurant comes from the last person I'd expect: Shia Labeouf. I really think he carried a lot of the scenes that could have been dull dialogue. When you first here that he's going to be a bootlegging gangster, of course you're not going to buy it. But after seeing how everyone else treats him, you buy it. And there is a third Bondurant who really slips under the radar: Howard played by the up and coming Jason Clarke. He's the real animal of the bunch. Even the indestructible Forrest wants him around to feel safe. All three of the brothers were perfectly cast and played their respective parts very well. But the storytelling aspect was a little slow at first. It was nothing but isolated scenes. Nothing lead to the next part, it was just choppy and one thing after another. It didn't detract from the story itself, but better editing and writing could have made the story more enjoyable. The story didn't flow as well as you would hope in the fast moving world of moonshining, but you could still enjoy all scenes for what they were there for. And as the movie progressed, it became more fluid and coherent. Towards the latter part of the film is when you even get most of the action you expect from this type of movie. Most of the pacing issues lie in the first half. It's choppy and jerky without its action, but it can definitely be engaging.One other thing that bothered me was the use, or misuse, of three supporting characters. First off, it's just cruel to list Gary Oldman as third billed and only show him for a grand total of 5 minutes. It's just not nice. Next, we have Jessica Chastain. She's becoming a star and I'm glad that she's taking a vast amount of different roles, but the character served nearly no purpose. She was a love interest for Forrest and helped out with some of the business aspects of moonshining. But she was a very expendable character that had no true significance to the story. And last we have Mia Wasikowska. She serves as the love interest for Jack. But that love interest is expendable with no purpose. The only purpose she served was towards the end that could viewed of as a certain negative plot device. But all of those problems can be forgotten every time Guy Pearce shows up on screen. He handles his role so well that I completely forgot that he is Guy Pearce. Trust me, he was unbelievable and will leave you speechless.In the end, 'Lawless' is a fun ride that does its job even if it doesn't do anything else. It might have a ""been there done that"" feel, but it's a fun ride with a lot of action and jaw-dropping moments. You'll have a good time powered by all of the performances and the great visionary filming from John Hillcoat. {B}",Lawless

The cast and style of Lawless is going to send it straight up the box office charts.",Lawless
258,Prinsterish,A Plot Line Muddled in Blood,7,29 August 2012,"Amongst many summer action blockbusters, Director John Hillcoat attempts to shine the audience with a glimmer of gritty, old world splendor in ""Lawless"". While Lawless won me over with a refreshing plot surrounding moonshine and the Prohibition era, the film's plot lingered far too long above the reel, leading me to believe that Lawless did in fact break one important storytelling law. That is, a satisfactory climax.Upon first look many months ago, the film's cast is what caught my eye. Shia LaBeouf is the young protagonist, Jack Bondurant. His two partners in crime consist of his two brothers, Forrest Bondurant and Howard Bondurant, played by Tom Hardy and Jason Clark respectively. Their enemy, on the law's side, is Charlie Rakes, a brutal, self-indulged detective played by none other than Guy Pearce; one of my favorite actors. Gary Oldman also fills a roll in the film as wanted criminal, Floyd Banner. Unfortunately, the audience sees too few of him to be able to call him a large contributor to the plot. Additionally and quite stereotypically of gritty, western-like films, women interests arise played by Jessica Chastain and Mia Wasikowska. Finally, ""Chronicle"" star Dane DeHaan plays Cricket Pate, an assistant and friend to the Bondurant brothers. In hindsight, casting was very well done in this film aside from a few characters. First, Shia, although I consider him to be a good actor, nothing new was under the sun in this film. As seen in the many of his movies, especially in Michael Bay's Transformer trilogy, LaBeouf is very good at being an emotional wreck. Mix that emotion with anger and he begins a screaming and yelling fit in which he becomes some type of screen monster that spits out an extraordinary amount of saliva. While his multiple emotional outbursts do not ruin the film, they are slightly distracting and invoke quite a bit of déjà vu. Oldman's character was a great character casted with a greater actor. Unfortunately his character is too small for Oldman. I really enjoy Oldman's acting and the different type of characters he can play, however, when a character he plays receives only about 15 minutes of screen time, you're left wanting more and disappointed. Again, the casting decision did not alter or taint the film in any way—it was just, disappointing. Alternatively, two acting choices I thought were great were Hardy and Pearce. Hardy played a straight faced, poised moonshine criminal who knew how to send a message and despite his lack of emotion, his character was a joy to watch. On the other hand, Pearce in his roll gave me the chills. Guy fit right into a character that had brutality, intelligence, and an interesting slicked back hairdo. His character, Charlie Rakes was the perfect antagonist and I believe that Pearce is the man responsible; a fantastic watch. As I stated above, Lawless' plot is quite refreshing. Although it is another gritty, criminal film, no modern film has attempted to produce a story or a screenplay in the prohibition era surrounding the production of illegal moonshine. The film follows the Bondurant brothers, Jack, Forrest, and Howard on their under the table deals of illegal alcohol in Franklin County, Virginia. Raised together on a farm, the brothers stood by each other and began to produce moonshine for profit. Of course, such a job comes with difficulties such as thieves and deals gone wrong. However, the brothers have been able to overcome all obstacles mostly with bloody violence in order to stake a place in the illegal market. So much so that the brothers have become a legend of invincibility in Virginia. Although business is booming, everything changes when Charlie Rakes, a brutal and well-dressed detective comes to town. When Forrest and the brothers refuse to pay a ""tax"" on their production, Rakes will use any force necessary to stop the brothers, which begins a bloody and violent county war between the brothers and the law in which only one party can come out on top.Although a plot synopsis might seem intriguing, the plot is what holds this film back from being anything more than a summer blockbuster. Between the very violent and bloody attacks of the law and the Bondurant brothers, there seems to be a lack of cohesiveness in the film. As I sit here and write, I still cannot completely figure out why the climax fed to me in the theater and in the film was not satisfactory. While the plot advances during the film, each event seems to be just another shootout or an act of violence that somehow leads up to a final shootout. It felt like cinema pinball; the ball would, metaphorically, hit different scenes and plot points yet never linked them all together in a satisfying climax. To put it simply, the film is jumbled. Yes, the plot makes sense and leads to a climax but does so in a very roundabout way that leaves the audience asking, ""Is that it?"" Lawless just doesn't seem to have the so-called ""bang"" many were expecting from a violent, gun-toting film.Well casted, well written, and well-acted, Lawless is a well-made film, there's no doubt. It's a fun watch and an entertaining adult summer blockbuster. Unfortunately, the plot is what holds this film back from being anything further. In the end, Lawless just doesn't seem to have a distinct, satisfactory plot line and if it does, it's covered in blood.",Lawless
259,Hojangs,"An engaging, well-crafted bootlegging drama.",8,10 September 2012,"I've been a fan of John Hillcoat's since I saw his brutal Australian outback drama, The Proposition (2005). 'Lawless,' reminds me a great deal of said film, in that both are violent, atmospheric crime dramas with a strong cast of characters, wonderful visuals and taught story- telling. 'Lawless,' begins with a brief scene, depicting the three main characters, the Bondurant brothers, as young boys working on a farm. We are immediately introduced to their personalities, the youngest boy, Jack, revealing his timidness, whilst the two older brothers are seen to take control. The boys turn to men, and this is where the real story begins. Jack, now played by Shia LeBeouf, introduces us to their lifestyle; bootlegging and distribution of illegal moonshine. LeBeouf gives his strongest performance of his career to date, his character experiencing the greatest transformation on screen. Jack Bondurant begins as a timid, nervous young man, but as his and his brother's business takes off, he becomes a swaggering, cock-sure wannabe gangster, decked in fine clothes and driving exquisite motors. Tom Hardy's seemingly-immortal Forest Bondurant is the polar opposite, a monosyllabic, hulking man of very few words. Hardy channels the drawl of John Wayne, his performance understated, quiet yet moving, powerful and a surprising source of comedic value. In my opinion, more should have been seen of the oldest brother, played by Jason Clarke. Howard Bondurant is rarely seen without a jar of moonshine in his hand, but his character is never really explored, bar the brief mention of being the sole survivor of his troupe in WW1.The supporting cast are excellent. Guy Pearce is truly repulsive as the slippery Special Agent Charlie Rakes, sent from Chicago to try and muscle in on their bootlegging business and take a cut of the profits. His physical appearance compliments the performance, his hair particularly being as greasy and slick as his character. Jessica Chastain is perhaps the most prominent of the female characters, a former dancer from the city who wanted to escape city life. However, this is primarily a film about men, thus both her and Mia Wasikowska, as Jack's religious love interest, are confined to the sidelines for most of the film. Gary Oldman does the best with what is primarily a brief cameo as a big time gangster from the city. His lack of screen time and that of the women, is perhaps the film's greatest weak point.The cinematography is excellent, with sweeping shots of the beautiful vistas and great camera work throughout. The set and costume design is also exquisite, rich in detail and authenticity. Ultimately, this is a well-made, engaging film, with the lack of character development perhaps its greatest flaw. However, if you wanted to see a mature, strongly performed crime epic, you could do a lot worse.8/10",Lawless
260,stjem05,Violent but touching,9,30 August 2012,"I am not one to cringe during violence in movies but this one actually made me nauseous at one point. That being said, I think it was violence with a purpose; they did a good job portraying the chaos and Lawlessness (hence the title) that ran rampant during the prohibition. The actors were amazing in this movie (although the accents made them hard to understand at times, I found myself wishing there were subtitles), and I grew very attached to the characters. I was actually on the edge of my seat at one point when one of the brothers seemed to suffer an injury that he couldn't possibly survive. Also, Guy Pierce did a great job acting, even if I did despise his character.Overall, I thought the story was good, the acting was good, and they definitely got the feel of an early 1900's town down pat.The reason I gave it a 9 was because very few movies deserve a ten.",Lawless
261,phil-johnston3-545-892970,Bad/Good Movie,5,3 December 2012,"It's not difficult to see why this movie has gotten mixed reviews. Some people love it. But some people are stupid, and there's definitely a correlation between those two groups. Lawless is a movie that should have been good but was hamstrung by the clumsy inexperience of Nick Cave's script. At no point did this movie know what it wanted to be or where it wanted to go. As a result, the final product is a mish mash of over-long expository dialogue sequences interspersed with some grizzly violence. The three brothers at the centre of the movie all appear at the beginning to be pretty cut and dry characters: Hardy is the tough guy, LaBeouf is the wimp and Jason Clarke's character is the wild card. But this only lasts a little while as LaBeouf is seen to be the ambitious, business savvy one while Hardy is actually the sensitive soul. No, there's no problem with characters evolving throughout a movie, its encouraged in fact, but it was executed in this movie with the nuance of a late night movie on cinemax. Lawless takes absolutely forever to get going and forsakes a lot of potentially interesting plot points in order to sustain the character driven story. But the characters are terribly written and poorly acted, so the movie drains the audience of its energy during the nearly two hour run time.Hardy looks out of place in this movie, still carrying the weight from The Dark Knight Rises and leaning heavily on his Bane voice, everything about his performance is underwhelming. His character is a brute from the beginning, but becomes oddly sensitive in the presence of Jessica Castain's character, who does nothing in the movie. She has three or four scenes and a handful of lines of dialogue before the audience is forced to sit through the inevitable and totally unbelievable romance with Hardy. LaBeouf isn't much more convincing in the role of the protagonist. His character jumps around from being weak and useless to outgoing tough-guy without any sense of character development. There are no reasons for his change, it just happens. Guy Pearce's considerable talents are wasted on the hammy, sociopathic villain who is so obviously evil for no reason that his scenes become funny to watch before the end. Garry Oldman, one of the classiest actor's in Hollywood, nails his role completely and checks out, his gravitas completely wasted by John Hillcoat.The one person on the crew who does work hard to save the movie is cinematographer Benoît Delhomme (The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas), because this movie is magnificently shot. If only the plot hadn't been so tedious, Lawless would have been a joy to watch. Prohibition-era greys and browns blend effortlessly with the luscious greens of rural Virginia and the sleek blacks of fancy new cars and firearms. It should also be noted that Hillcoat has done an admirable job directing. With time and money to work with, the movie is very well structured. It's easy to tell that the director got his hands dirty making this picture and it shines through, despite being hampered by the script.And that's really what this movie comes down to. If you build anything on unstable foundations, it's bound to collapse. Cave's ham-fisted characters and lumbering plot progression weigh this movie down from the opening sequence right up to the disappointing climax and instead of being a diamond in the rough of modern movies, Lawless takes a bad script and turns it into a crummy movie to be forgotten in the miasma of other modern movies who make exactly the same mistakes.goodbadreviews.wordpress.com",Lawless
262,matija-lozancic,Predictable but enjoyable crime drama,7,16 January 2019,"As I finished watching the movie, I felt my time passed by quickly but was left a bit unsatisfied with the ending. It's a fine depiction of the prohibition era in the country, adding a great dose of realism as it is based on a true story. I found Jack's (LaBeouf) and Forrest's (Hardy) characters absolutely compelling, deep, evolving as the story goes on. So much so that the comparison to the Godfather's main characters was very much visible- a classic family story of passing-the-torch. Jack (Michael Corleone) a calm, beta-male persona, learn of the tough ways from his older brother (don Vito) who is a dominant, seemingly invincible head of the family. As the old man gets hurt, the youngster steps on the scene, toughens up, and faces the enemies with a newfound hatred.Tom Hardy was absolutely magnetic, indestructible alpha-male, whose destiny gets a bit too much predictable- i have to say. The story, while being exciting, is laid on a pretty predictable level. In the end, it's not the story that drives this film, it's the character development. However, i feel like Maggie's (Jessica Chastain) character was a bit undeveloped, left somehow ""hanging in the air"" feeling during the whole movie, and also what's with the gangster Floyd Banner? During the climax i was just waiting for his character to show up and maybe stand on Jack's side, but he wasn't there. It left a bit incomplete feel about the story, since he was fitting in as a perfect anti-villain.The scenery is a very strong point of this film. A beautiful Virginia countryside is where this story takes place, and every scene is definitively a joy to watch.However, Guy Pierce is a driving force of this movie as an absolutely appaling, evil, hateful enemy that makes you want to see the end of him ever since the first time he steps on the scene. Excellent performance.This crime drama beautifully depicts the 1930's era of the American east and, while predictable in it's story, makes you watch it with joy either because of the love for the main character, or the hate for the antagonist- or both.

263,npyx,Worst of John Hillcoat so far...,4,12 July 2013,"I've seen (almost) anything John Hillcoat directed so far, from ""Ghosts... of The Civil Dead"" to ""The Road"". My opinion is, comparing his other work, this film was his worst one.Let me explain my view starting with the potential of the film: Cast was good obviously - except the guy who played Jack. Nick Cave, being Nick Cave, is a big plus. A perfect setting for the director whom had told impressive stories in his earlier work.But it doesn't seem this potential was used - or it could not be used. One reason could be the story itself - or maybe the plot. But most probably there was a problem with the story-telling. One of the weakest characters I've ever witnessed - Jack, an annoying gangster wanna-be - is on the front line. I'm saying ""weak"" not because Jack is weak per se, he's weak as a film character. Along the whole movie we witness how much ""distance"" he can go. As he goes, nothing is improved in the sense of storyline. A pointless way to go.The film also doesn't take notice the contradiction of human behavior or societies. Pure black and white. Dictating and irritating common sense trash. Eye for an eye, evil is evil, etc. Remember ""The Proposition"" and how that film questioned one's view towards phenomenon like society, crime, common law, punishment or humanity? Well, you'll find none of that here.What you will find here is a drama... kind of. A very simplistic view of a bootlegger story setting in a little town. Don't expect a coherent and impressive cinematic experience like you did in many Hillcoat films.I hope he keeps collaborating with the same crew and directs many many more good films that you can easily point out his Hillcoat signature on them. I hate to see such a big potential is used ineffectively.",Lawless
264,i_ellaine_rocks333,It's like Boardwalk empire...,7,16 April 2013,"I used to love Boardwalk Empire. Fascinating what men can do for money and alcohol. The war between them, killing one of the members of the enemy because the enemy just killed one of theirs. I missed Boardwalk Empire and this movie reminded me of it. I was an icing on the cake when I knew that it was a true story. Although the plot was not extraordinary--it was something that I've already seen--what made it special are the actors that where in it. Tom Hardy was as always a hot bad ass. Shaia was as always promising bringing his naive-boy-who-just-wants-to-do-the- right-thing-and-prove-something-in-the-world attitude. And Peirce, the veteran actor who doesn't have to prove how good he already is in the Hollywood scene. Fighting for what they believed is theirs and killing whoever is in their way is where the story circles. The brutal scenes are the ones I did crave for. Although Tom Hardy being cut in the throat and shot a lot of times and still was alive and happy drinking at the end of the film is a bit too unrealistic for me even if it did really happen (not really sure how accurate the movie was). My only complaint is I did see some scenes that are too familiar to me especially in a Hollywood movie.But again the important thing is the actors and all the other elements (like the setting) did jive well making the movie not like any other typical Hollywood old action film. So I give the actors 10/10, plot 7/10 , all in all giving it a 17/20!LOL :D watch it, you won't say it's crap after seeing it :)",Lawless

267,kevinsterne,Lawless is LaBeouf's best yet,8,6 September 2012,"For me, one Transformers movie was enough and two more were overkill, the Indiana Jones franchise was perfect as a trilogy, and call me crazy, but I still think Shia LaBeouf's best work was on the Disney show ""Even Stevens"". His newest effort, however, could be indication that he is finally done tormenting us with films like ""Eagle Eye"" and ready to take his craft a little more seriously.Set in 1930's Franklin Count, Virginia, ""Lawless"" depicts the violent true story of the bootlegging outlaw Bondurant brothers (LaBeouf and Tom Hardy) against big city mobster, Floyd Banner (Gary Oldman) and crooked Chicago deputy, Charlie Rakes (Guy Pierce). This is definitely a step into unknown territory for LaBeouf, a well-crafted film staring some incredibly talented actors portraying the gritting world of illegal liquor distribution. Luckily he's able to rely on his co-stars, Tom Hardy and Guy Pierce, to carry the film.While Tom Hardy doesn't quite have the whiskey-and-tobacco-mixed-with-gravel drawl perfected like, say, Jeff Bridges in ""True Grit"", his dialogue is creatively minimized to make all his lines memorable and his character entertaining. His character here is similar to that of Bane from ""The Dark Knight Rises""; he lets the story tell the audience about his character. And this works perfectly as the entire film hinges on the legendary perception of Forrest Bondurant to drive the narrative while chief protagonist, Jack (LaBeouf), can struggle to emerge from his brother's shadow.At its core this is the classic tale of a younger brother trying to live up to his older brother's reputation. Lawless flawlessly masters the drama of this hero's journey by offsetting it with engaging and realistic action that is never overbearing.Chief villain, Charlie Rakes, is ruthless and evil but brilliantly portrayed by Guy Pierce. We hate his character's demeanor from the moment he is introduced but LaBeouf's work is much harder to gauge. He pains us with the same silly, immature moments that made ""Disturbia"" so hard to watch but then wows with his performance in the film's epic climax. He still has some kinks to work out but this appears to be an actor coming into his own in a film that is, without a doubt, his best to date.Overall grade: A-",Lawless
268,mikey141,Lawless,7,7 November 2012,"This was one of only a few films I have seen at the cinema this year but I rank it among the best to have come out this year.The acting was brilliant: Tom Hardy was great at the silent but no less powerful Forrest (two great performances in one year!). Shia LaBeouf was at his best I think as Jack, showing how well he can act if put in the right film. Guy Pearce was particularly menacing as Charlie Rakes and stole most scenes he was in. Jessica Chastain was good as Maggie Beauford and Mia Wasikowska was also good as Bertha Minnix but both were given little to do unfortunately. Gary Oldman was very underused (I think he had about 5 minutes screen time)but was as good as always in those scene. Jason Clarke was very good as Howard as well.I thought the film had a really good story and I liked how the Director played on the element of the brothers being 'invincible'. Particularly the scene where Forrest gets his throat slit and everyone thinks he walked all the way to the hospital when Maggic actually drove him. It all helps the idea that they are invincible and how they need that to control the fear.I thought the ending quite ironic after how Forrest survived so much damage yet in the end was killed by pneumonia.Overall the ending seemed quite rushed by was okay.There is no way to know if these events really happened that are portrayed in the film and book it is based on as the book was written by the grandson of real life Jack from the film but he wrote it from newspaper clippings etc but it is really interesting and you can make your own judgement on whether events were real or not. The Direction, writing and score were all good but nothing special worth noting in this review for me personally.Overall it was a very good film and I look forward to seeing it again on DVD.",Lawless

Not because they were famous or infamous, but because they were family.The story is embellished, a few anecdotes and characteristics are accurate. But the overall plot is stretched pretty far. My mother gave me the book which was written by my cousin Matt to read just before she passed away. She did highly recommend it.It's a very entertaining film, true or not.

271,rundee,This movie is a waste of time and actually quite annoying,3,30 January 2013,"First off, I read a lot of reviews about this movie, because I could not understand the 7, because I really thought it's bad. Roger Ebert explains it all and there's only one thing I needed to add to the one review I can fully agree with. (You can read his review when you click on the reviews critics button right on top of the page right to the movie-poster. He's on no.1 there) What I wanna add is this: - God, was I annoyed by the stupidity of the character Shia LaBeef played. It seemed as if the director was thinking ""I cannot come up with something that would make this movie worthwhile so why not let the kid do something stupid again, at least then something is happening"". So this movie became a story around someone doing foolish things so that everyone around him gets into trouble or killed or severely harmed. Me and my fellow movie-watcher stopped the film several times and groaned with pain ""Why isn't he dead already, somebody kill him, PLEASE""Two minor things:Tom Hardys voice sounded like Banes of ""The dark knight does something, cannot recall what right now"" he was shooting shortly after that. It was so deep it seemed comical in this movie here. Speaking of comical: Guy Pearces character. It's so overly dramatic, hyperbolic and like a villain in a comic book that it's kind of sad how bad a director can be. (And yet you still really, really want him to shoot the stupid kid portrayed by Shia LaBeef to get it over with already).So this movie gets 1 for Mia Wasikowska, 1 for Gary Oldman (not that you seem him much, but hey, I like him, I'm biased) and 1 for the great cars that clearly play the main role in this movie.",Lawless

273,dionnemking,A slice of Gothic Hill Billy,7,17 September 2012,"Lawless reunites creative collaborators John Hillcoat and Nick Cave for a beautifully crafted, prohibition era drama. Adapted by Cave from Matt Bondurant's novel, 'The Wettest County in the World', Hillcoat's third feature dramatises the true story of the Bondurant Brothers' bootlegging business in 1930's Virginia.Amid the distilleries dotted across the Blue Ridge Mountains, brothers, Forest, (Tom Hardy) Howard (Jason Clarke) and Jack (Shia LeBoef) serve a superior brew at their isolated bar. Forest, the mastermind, and Howard, the muscle, have earned respect and reverence, freely trading moonshine with locals and lawmen across the county. Their invincibility has passed into myth while naive, youngest brother, Jack sweeps the bar room floor, his aspiration to join the business mocked.While Jack's humiliated, clumsily courting Bertha, (Mia Wasikowska) the unattainable preacher's daughter, Chicago showgirl Maggie, (Jessica Chastain) arrives at the brother's dusty outpost looking to get lost. Amid the brutality of the bar, repressed, knuckle-duster, Forest realises his longing for the savvy, sexy, new barmaid.Their liberty is shattered by contemptuous, Chicago, lawman, Charlie Rakes (Guy Pearce). Deputised to enforce prohibition, he confronts the county moonshiners demanding a price to control trade. When Forest rejects his extortion, the brothers stand alone with Jack drawn into a cruel and brutal conflict that tests the brother's legend to the limit.Lawless has some well-judged performances from the ensemble cast. Tom Hardy extends his versatility as violent but introverted Forest. Jason Clarke's is intense as Howard. LeBoef's, impetuous, youthful Jack is both endearing and frightening. In supporting roles, Jessica Chastain is tough yet feminine as Maggie while Mia Wasikowska is charming as Bertha looking for adventure outside the Mennonite church. Only Guy Pearce's performance as vain and sexually repressed Rakes tends towards caricature Touches of Nick Cave's originality cut through the script with some great characterisations and deadpan humour amid the relentless brutality, Lawless feels enslaved to the romanticism of the book written by one of the brother's Grandsons.The film maximises the soundtrack that evokes and transcends the era. A collaboration between Cave and Warren Ellis, who dubbed themselves The Bootleggers, it features vocals from, among others, 85-year-old bluegrass legend Ralph Stanley, on punk covers.It is visually stunning, beautifully shot by Benoît Delhomme with a wonderful sense of place. Production and costume design by Chris Kennedy and Margot Wilson respectively are exquisite but almost overwhelm the story While it lacks the originality of Hillcoat's first feature, The Proposition, it is menacing and stylish with a brilliant, driving soundtrack.",Lawless
274,mihart-m,Shia Labeouf completely miscast,4,12 November 2013,"I enjoyed the story, it is a very interesting time in history. It could have been a great story. Some exceptional acting (namely Guy Pearce and Tom Hardy) really could have brought the story to life. Instead they centered more around Jack who is played by Shia LaBeouf. Because of that decision it is hard to root for the main character. Feel empathy, excitement, satisfaction. Emotionless.I can't help wonder though why they thought Shia Labeouf (I have nothing against him in the right role) was a good fit for Jack. I'm not sure I have ever felt quite so strongly of a poor casting call. He was horrible as Jack. No depth, no heart, I could not feel for his character what-so-ever. Unfortunately this poor call ruined much of the movie for me.",Lawless
275,LibrarianOrangutan,"Massacre movie marketed as ""western""",3,17 September 2012,"I had rather high expectations on Lawless, although I didn't know very much about it on beforehand. However, I was deeply disappointed in the movie.Looking to the plot, it was convincing enough, as were the costumes and settings (beautifully filmed scenery, I have to admit).But - the first of 2 major issues - what was up with all the unnecessarily explicit violence? Sure, I get it that they want to make ""mafia""/old western kind of movie. I do not get though, why they thought showing (believable) torture and blood all over the place would help? It wasn't stylistic and clean. It wasn't Tarantino:esque, it wasn't Cohen:esque (oh, how I wish it had been!) - it was just all over the place. Rather than letting the viewer imagining all the horrors that went on, they set out to show it. Secondly - where were the women? Just looking at the IMDb cast list gives a hint. On the first page there are 15 names. Two of those names are female (place 5 and 6). Had the writers wanted to, they could easily have written more, strong women into the movie. Instead we get a priest daughter who likes to cuddle a baby deer, and a woman who rather stays home crying than fighting for her lover's life.Honestly, it wouldn't have been difficult to make Jessica Chastain's (awesome acting by the way) character a bit more willful and strong. It wouldn't. It would fit right in with the plot. It would have been convincing. So why wouldn't they? I wish I knew.All in all, the actors were surprisingly good, love Jessica Chastain, Jason Clarke and Gary Oldman. Shia LaBeouf, well, he could have done worse.That this movie gets as high as a 3/10 from me is mainly due to the filming, and the settings. They've paid attention to period typical details, which I appreciated.But - had I not been seated in the middle of a full cinema, I would have walked out in the middle of the movie.",Lawless
276,uforbedrelig,The Movie I've Been Waiting For!,9,30 November 2012,"It's been a long time since I've seen such a good gangster flick. While movies like American Gangster and Puclic Enemies has left me disappointed, this certainly shines as a bright light in the genre. But this is not your typically gangster flick, although it's set in the prohibition era.The movie follows the 3 Bondurant brothers back in the 1930's, in a small county, who produced moonshine and sold it illegally. The youngest brother Jack(Shia Lebeouf) desperately struggles to become a part of the family business and gain acceptance as an equal to his brothers. The quiet and very menacing Forrest(Tom Hardy) runs the show and basically see's himself and his brothers as immortals. This all changes when a Deputy called Rakes(Guy Pearce) comes to the county with the promise of bringing the brothers business to it's knee's.Tom Hardy is amazing as Forrest Bondurant and once again delivers a fantastic performance. He really knows how to immerse himself into a character and make it stand out as something special. This is also unquestionably the greatest performance from Shia Lebeouf, who steps out of the shadow of the Transformers series and finally plays a character with a lot more soul to it. Guy Pearce steals the show as the over-the-top Deputy Rakes. He is definitely one of the best villains ever to hit the big screen and it's amazing to watch him and the Bondurant brothers going up against each other. Gary Oldman also features as mobster Floyd Banner, and although it's a minor character, he does have some epic scenes in the movie. Actually there's really no bad performances in this movie.The movie itself mostly sets a dark tone, but it does contain some fun and bright moments. It has a lot of on-screen violence and a couple of scenes ain't for the faint hearted. But this is not an Avengers-action type of flick, it has it's slow moments with a love themed side-story, but i never felt that it took me too far away from the main plot. I only have one complaint about one of the last scenes in the movie, but I won't spoil it for you. Besides it's not a deal breaker in any way, I still love the movie. I've never been a big fan of John Hillcoat, but this is definitely his masterpiece. Do yourself a favor and don't miss this!",Lawless

So begin ""The Baked Reviews"" I had a couple of bowls before trekking to the theater for this show. It was a good way to forget the day's troubles, and forget them I did, but not this film. Since that was so last week, and I still remember what happens. The price of admission is worth seeing Shia LaBeouf get his face beat in while crying about it. Yes there's a scene here for you Shia haters. Other than that marvelous gem, there is a really weird Guy Pierce who steals every scene he is in. His character is repulsive, and it looks like Guy watched Bob Geldof's role as Pink in ""Pink Floyd The Wall"" for inspiration (shaved eyebrows and all, creepy). You have Tom Hardy who just can't die, and laughably enough, can't stop sounding like Bane. My only real complaint is the relative absence of Gary Oldman here. They had such a great actor to milk a memorable gangster performance from and they just wasted it. He only makes two appearances, I think, and they stand out. You keep wanting his character to show up again, but the audience is cheated. More Gary Oldman and less Shia narration would have improved this otherwise great film. 8 out of 10 spliffs.",Lawless
278,Scribemonger1,A lawless mountain of inconsistency,5,1 September 2013,"I went into this movie with very high hopes, having been very impressed with the previous collaboration between director John Hillcoat and writer Nick Cave - 'The Proposition.' Both films feature highly talented casts, plots centered around family loyalty among brothers in outlaw gangs, lots of violence and soundtracks scored by Cave and Warren Ellis. That's about where the similarities end, however.While 'The Proposition' manages to maintain an internal logic and coherence throughout the script, I found myself cringing at the mounting inconsistencies and illogicalities of 'Lawless.'There is for example, a scene where one character has his throat cut and is left to die behind a car at night. Despite the enormous loss of blood, he somehow manages to hang on while his love interest instinctively changes her mind about leaving, turns her car round and drives back to the house, where she herself is attacked and raped (not shown in the film) by the two throat-cutters. At some point (also not shown in the film) she recovers from the attack, finds her lover lying in a pool of blood, drags his body (she's half his size) into the car and drives him to hospital - amazingly without him bleeding to death. We don't find out whether she herself received treatment for what was probably quite a horrific rape. In fact we don't really get to know any of the female characters at all. They only seem to be there to help set up extremely long-winded plot turns and revelations involving the men. Having said that, I thought the performances were all very good, as you'd expect from a cast like this. However, I did have to go back and watch 'Bronson' with Tom Hardy in the lead to remind myself that the guy can actually speak quite eloquently. It took me a while to get used to the mumbled hillbilly accents but this is the sort of film where you can pretty much follow the story even without understanding the dialogue. And I think it says a lot that by the end of it Gary Oldman, who plays hardened gangster and killer Floyd Banner, actually ends up looking like the sort gentle, benevolent uncle I'd invite round for a cup of tea. The one actor who really stood out for me, surprisingly, was Jason Clarke as Howard. I was a little shocked when I read that they originally considered James Franco for the role, because I can't imagine him portraying the same sort of fierce, glassy-eyed loyalty to his brothers that Clarke does with such conviction.Generally for me, though, both the actual and implied violence totally overwhelms the script almost from the first scene. By the time we get to watch Shia LeBeouf breaking down in front of his brothers over the death of Cricket, we (or at least I) couldn't care less. Under the weight of all the seemingly disconnected violence, I found the characters progressively became less and less believable, almost farcically so, such as when Charlie Rakes, who is easily the most evil character in this film, has what can only be called a 'hissy fit' during the gun fight at the bridge. That, coupled with the challenge of reconciling the image of two men engaged in a grotesque torture, with later scenes of the same men frolicking in idyllic domestic harmony, and I walked out of this film with a sense of relief that it was finally over.",Lawless
279,marlena-796-660302,Fascinating! Riveting! Exciting!,10,2 January 2016,"Tom and Shia make this a great movie! It was so fun, interesting and exciting I went rift out and purchased the book. The characters are very well rounded and developed. Each scene leaves you on the edge of your seat, waiting and wanting more. The locations and historical implications for our country make this far more interesting than a completely fictional movie. Tom Hardy is a phenomenal actor...as is the rest of the cast. Their chemistry works well. It is horrible what he lived through and then to die of pneumonia. Horrific what the police did! The sheer personal fortitude of his family is so impressive. This was their way of life, and maybe wrong and ""lawless"" but it is shameful that the police were ""lawless"" as well.",Lawless
280,EmilyEkdahl24,Breaking Laws and Blowing Minds,8,3 November 2014,When I read the storyline of this movie I was expecting it to be wild and honestly didn't expect it to be so good. I found myself getting caught up in the movie and at points getting angry at the way events happened. I love that this movie was based on a true story and although not every event that happened may or may not be real the way the movie played out made me think that every single detail was true. I remember learning about the prohibition in my history class in school and this movie changed the way I look at that era and history all together. It made me change the way I look at it because this movie made me feel like I was part of the drama that took place and I absolutely love that. It made me feel like I was a part of the movie because IT was based upon one family and how each event affected them and their loved ones around them and to me any movie that follows one family and shows all the good and bad that happens to them and can make the audience feel apart of the story is a great film. Definitely recommend this movie to anyone that asks about it.,Lawless

Shia Labeouf, Tom Hardy, and all the other actors were stellar in their roles and made for an incredible entertaining and interesting film. Watch it!!!!",Lawless
283,jammarsh-82383,Brilliant movie a little boring in the middle but an incredible ending,8,2 April 2021,This is an incredible movie about 3 hillbilie brothers in the 1930s. This is a good gore fest movie with a load of action and slick characters. Only problem is that it gets a little boring about 10-20 minutes in the middle but the ending definetly makes up for it. Definitly would recommened.,Lawless
284,jdavies-41440,Likeable movie but nothing spectacular,6,5 November 2021,"Lawless is about three brothers who sell alcohol in a rural Virginia during the prohibition era. The three brothers have quite different personalities, you have Forrest the leader who is quiet but dangerous played by Tom Hardy. Howard who is also very tough but without leadership qualities and drinks a bit too much played by Jason Clarke. And then you have Shia Leboufs character Jack the less tough younger brother who is a little insecure and wants to make a name for himself.This is based on a true story and the storyline is fairly straightforward. Two of the brothers have love stories that drift in and out of the movie and are not especially memorable because the movie is centered far more on their bootlegging enterprises. Officer Rakes moves from Chicago to try and shut them down and he is a very chilling figure who definitely doesn't like to get blood on his clothes. Gary Oldman makes a cameo appearance as Floyd Banner but it's mainly in the early stages of the film.There are a number of fairly good action scenes involving savage beatings, knives, and 1920s style tommy guns which are enjoyable and the storyline is easy enough to follow too. It's a satisfying enough watch without being anything spectacular, the moments of emotional acting are quite brief but I thought that Shia Lebouf pulled off being stricken with pain after finding out about a death rather well. The score involves a few songs about bootleggers and was very much in theme with everything. Worth a watch but I don't see this movie living too long in my memory.",Lawless
285,simh2005,This film Sucks.... YOU IN...,9,2 January 2013,"Never wrote a review before as you probably will tell but felt compelled to talk about this Film. To start with i gotta say i loved this movie... LAWLESS is the true story of the infamous Bondurant Brothers: bootlegging siblings who made a run for the American Dream in Prohibition-era Virginia. In this epic outlaw tale, inspired by true- life tales of author Matt Bondurant's family in his novel ""The Wettest County In The World"", the loyalty of three brothers is put to the test against the backdrop of the nation's most notorious crime wave. I really thought the film mostly centred on Shia LaBeoufs character, personally i'd rather they'd focus on the dark an moody tom Hardy's character, he really felt to me that he should of been the main focal point. There is some inconsistencies with the plot especially when tom Hardy's character gets his throat slit and is left for dead, if it wasn't for the fact this is a true story then i'd find it very hard to swallow that this actually happened. Also villain of the year (2012) has to go to guy Pearce his portrayal of Charlie Rakes was so good you forget that this is guy Pearce. I know this film isn't gonna be in many peoples top 10 of 2012 but for me its got everything a character driven film needs.",Lawless
286,b-hine,Lawless: Far from flawless but a great romp,8,20 September 2012,"I was nervous about seeing Lawless, as I had heard a number of mixed reviews. A lot of people saying that it was incredibly violent, at some points gratuitously so and people saying that the plot was lost at points, hard to follow, and trying too hard. Others wrote that whilst the acting may be good, the film did not come together as a unified and coherent piece of cinema. I don't know what movie these people saw.In one word, Lawless was brilliant. Following the true story of the 3 'invincible' Bondurant brothers in prohibition Virginia, this film provided lots to entertain and shock us. Whilst the thick accents were hard to understand at first, once you had gotten used to Tom Hardy's deep drawl he provided excellently well timed hits of comic relief amongst a largely gripping script. Shia LaBouf took to his first decent lead role with great passion and depth, and delivered a strong performance amongst an excellent cast. Guy Pearce provided a villain that it felt deeply good to hate, and Jessica Chastain and Mia Wasikowska made great quiet heroines throughout (Maggie revealing that she had driven Forrest to the hospital, destroying his belief that he walked 20 miles, had me laughing out loud).Yes the violence was extremely explicit, but this film gave me nothing that I hadn't seen before and for that I was grateful. It flirted with the 'too much' line and stayed just the right side, giving you moments to wince at but nothing that might make you regret buying a large popcorn. Particular favourites were an incredibly visceral throat cutting, and Tom Hardy's knuckle-dusted hand slamming into the throat of a would-be attacker.My main criticism would probably be the lack of Gary Oldman, who should have featured more heavily. But he played his part incredibly well, no surprises there (Oldman shooting out a passing car with a Tommy gun and then slowing winking at the camera whilst swaggering by should probably go down as one of the best scenes in recent cinema history!). But largely, there is not a lot to complain about in this film, and it provides a great romp from start to finish. Not to mention it is beautifully shot. From Guy Pierce and Shia LaBouf's silhouetted figures on the bridge, to Jessica Chastain driving through the light snow, the cinematography is stunning (with superb uses of light).Lawless also explores family dynamics and struggle in a very sincere way. Jack's constant tussle to break into the business of his two brothers provides a very obvious character to root for (and reminds us of our own sibling-based struggles), and when he finally takes his shots at enemy Charlie Rakes you feel proud that he has grown up. Yeah they are bad guys, but they are the good bad guys, and you want them to win.To keep it brief, this film provided a great modern western, showing the small town battles that helped shape communities and lives when America had undoubtedly become a little bit lawless.",Lawless
287,sandhammaren05,Typical stereotypes portrayed,5,8 January 2013,"Stereotype of hillbillies running and drinking moonshine. Here are some points where the film maker should have done his homework.1. If there are Amish in Franklin Cty. then they probably speak Pennsylvania German/Pennsylvanisch, not English, with each other. Also, they chant in German, not English. The film that got this all more or less right is 'Witness', where local Mennonites were hired to speak their language in the roles. 2. Changing the carburetor on a Model A or T will not hop it up, much more was needed. 3. Moonshiners with enough money to have a restaurant/bar probably would not paper a bedroom wall with old newspaper. Or with new newspaper, for that matter. 4. Was the 'agent' an agent or a mafioso? 5. A man whose throat is slit generally dies pretty fast. In the film the guy survived. 6. The English spoken was not hillbilly English. Hillbilly English stems from an old Scottish dialect. The region was populated mainly by Germans and Scots, some English and French, the Scots determined the language.The film was depressing and gruesome beyond redemption.",Lawless
288,god_is_a_myth,Disappointingly Average,5,26 March 2013,"I am writing this review as most of the reviews on IMDb for the movie has been positive which led me to expect an above-avg movie but i was sadly left disappointed after watching the film.The negative reviews i have seen were mostly one line reviews & hence it was difficult to take them seriously.So i wish to provide a more accurate picture than the present rating would lead viewers to believe.(it is currently more than 7 but the latest trend on IMDb is that it drops pretty steeply after the movie is released on blue-ray or shown on TV)The movie shows the life of 3 brothers - Tom Hardy as Forrest,the able leader of the operation, Howard played by an unknown actor is the muscle for the group & Jack played by Shia Labeouf the weakling amongst the three who is trying to earn respect from his older siblings(come on who in their right mind would respect Labeouf or take the guy seriously who is famous for playing supporting lead to cgi in Transformers). They run a bootlegging operation during Prohibition era & the main story is all about them trying to continue their business when a corrupt & villainous cop,played by Guy Pearce try to stop their operations.The biggest problem plaguing the movie is that it is strictly avg & very clichéd, nothing happens in the movie that we have not seen a 100 times before.Well there are always those people who say that every movie must not be a masterpiece or touch new heights & i completely agree with them.But a movie should be entertaining & in order to be so one should have interesting plot or relate able characters & this one has neither.In a gangster movie one does not expect characters to be moralistic or be the good guys but here the characters are outright stupid for example once Howard almost gets his brother (Tom Hardy) killed as he was busy getting drunk while the said brother believes himself to be immortal & invincible.Another time Jack leads the police to their secret hideout because he wanted to take his girl friend to the place where they make illegal liquor on their first date.(Labeouf once took Micheal Bay's side over Megan Fox during a controversy..so yeah we basically know he is not terribly bright with girls and once you see his filmography you realize he is not really bright with anything else for that matter).The acting is serviceable enough with the standout performance being that of Guy Pearce who is great as the diabolical cop.(I had been a great fan of his since he did Memento & L.A. Confidential & it pains me to see him acting in movies like this & the bag of crap called Prometheus). The female leads hardly have anything to do in the movie except be tepid love interests & show some nudity..not that i have any problem with the second. I have heard complaints about Tom Hardy's accent & i think criticizing a character or actor on basis of hairstyle or accent is a trivial thing to do.His acting is decent but it fails to hide a poorly written character who it seems will play a prominent part in the movie but that part never comes.Shia Labeouf does not ruin the viewing experience as he usually tends to do so even he is tolerable or maybe there is nothing really left to ruin.SPOILERS:- The ending is abysmal & as idiotic as it can get where Hardy has a gun pointed towards Guy Pearce but still manages to get shot numerous times on the chest without firing a single shot in return, what follows is even worse as he still survives (it would have been almost unbelievable if Hardy as Bane had survived that). It is simply ridiculous in a movie that tries to be a tightly scripted crime drama & not a summer action movie.My Final Verdict - There is neither anything cringe-worthy nor anything praiseworthy in the movie.It is very average, so you may watch it when it is on TV & you have nothing else to do but do not go about buying the blu-ray expecting something special.Had it not been for the ending it would have got a six. 5/10P.S. - To the fans of Oldman, A lot of reviewers have commented that Gary Oldman has given a great performance in the movie.Don't trust them as they are outright lying because he has only a cameo of 2 minutes & not even a minor role in the movie.",Lawless
289,kevinholeary,"Lawless is a superbly acted, thrilling spectacle",9,8 August 2012,"Had the privilege of attending a special advance screening featuring a Q&A with the author of the book following the film. I very much enjoyed the film. The acting was excellent, and the story compelling. The film did a great job emphasizing what it was like in the 1920s. Guy Pearce did an excellent job playing the villain and i wouldn't be surprised if he got put up for a few Oscar nominations. I have a new found respect for Shia Labeouf as well. He did an excellent job in this film and just seemed to pull it all off (the accent, costume, hairdo). Though i would have greatly appreciated if Gary Oldman had more screen time, he was still a nice addition to the film. After his debut in Chronice, Dane Dehaan rocked his role in this film. I don't wanna go too far in explaining the plot of the film because its probably best you know as little as possible before viewing. Just the right amount of humor is added into the film as well, which many directors can't infuse into a drama/thriller like this. THE BOTTOM WORD: I would highly recommend lawless to everybody because its a fun, gritty, violent drama that keeps you on the edge of your seat. The acting is superb, and i have a feeling the set design, and Guy Pearce will be up for some nominations at this year's Oscars. Go see lawless. Its worth your money.",Lawless

291,dragon_child15,"Great Film, Suspenseful, Heartfelt, Dramatic, Comical, but perhaps a touch too violent.",9,9 September 2012,"Lawless was a stunning movie, far better than I anticipated and with far more thought and heart put into than I expected, complete with gritty action scenes, heartfelt romances, a villain that terrifies you, and protagonists whom you love.The story was fantastic. The movie tells the story of the three Bondurant brothers: Forrest, the oldest played by Tom Hardy, Howard, the crazy one played by Jason Clarke, and Jack, the youngest played by Shia Labeouf. These three brothers are the finest Moonshiners in Franklin county, who run into trouble when Special Deputy Charlie Rakes shows up in town. Rakes wants in on the money the brothers are making, and he's willing to use any means to do so. It also serves as a coming of age tale for the youngest brother who is tired of being in his older brothers shadows and has recently found a love interest in the young preacher's daughter (Mia Wasikowska). Through the course of the movie, you became completely invested in wanting the Bondurant brothers to succeed and survive. They are the heroes in a movie where no true heroes exist. Corruption runs rampant in ""the wettest county in the world,"" where regular folk, gangsters, and law enforcement want in on the lucrative business of moonshining. The movie is packed with intense action scenes, comical moments that relieve the tension the moment it's come too much, moments that could make you cry, and everything that makes a movie great.The character created are incredible, especially those played by Hardy and Pearce. These two men are powerful forces within the film standing for opposite sides. Forrest (Hardy), as the oldest of the three brothers, is responsible for looking out for his two younger brothers and the business. At first, he seems almost mild mannered but you quickly realize that that ease in his body is nothing to do with a mild manner and instead covering a vicious and unstoppable force. A man of little words, though those he speak certainly matter, Forrest is admirable when perhaps the other brothers are not (Howard is a bit too crazy and Jack's-in a very typical role for Labeouf- stupidity and entrepreneurial ways drove me to frustration the entire movie). Hardy is brilliant in the role of Forrest, casting of his English accent to take on this slow Southern drawl that can fill with a certain menace at a moments notice or perhaps be affectionate and awkward (in regards to his own love story with Maggie, portrayed by Jessica Chastain). Hardy, after this role and The Dark Knight Rises's Bane, will certainly be one of the best actors of his generation and I look forward to seeing him in the future. Guy Pearce dominated as the villain in this piece. An unrelenting force with no redeeming qualities. He is the villain you hate and the villain that you never want to encounter. Pearce is captivating in this role. Transforming entirely from previous roles to embody Rakes. I think Pearce perhaps steals the show. He was in so little of the film, his scenes often short but highly impactful, yet even when he wasn't a physical presence, he was most certainly a very real presence hanging over the movie. Rakes joins the ranks of brilliant movie villains, and the entire movie I couldn't shake image of Anton Chigurh (No Country for Old Men) from my head.The only drawback I saw to this movie was the violence. This movie is not one for the light of heart or those with easily turned stomachs. I expected violence in this movie but I feel perhaps the sheer amount of blood was a bit unnecessary. I don't really wish to spoil any of the violent scenes, but there were several that I think could have still been included but toned down, one in particular involving the rougher side of the two oldest Bondurant brothers.However, Lawless is a movie I would definitely recommend for those who enjoy movies with a bit more substance to them than just a shoot 'em up movie. Lawless certain fits that category and it is filled with some great pieces of acting and brilliant writing.",Lawless
292,RockyPhillips,Effort put into some of the right places but shows the emptiness of the rest,6,27 August 2012,"LAWLESS is set during an interesting time - Virginia in the 1930s - Prohibition era following the Great Depression. The classic gangster / western plot of hard-working men fighting against the corrupt lawmen and politicians is not interesting. Guy Pearce as the villainous sheriff deputy adds a unique dimension to his character, but the three Hardy boys (the Bondurant brothers played by Tom Hardy and company), are empty, tough and unappealing ruffians. The whole family dynamic - including young brother trying to impress the older ones despite the illegality of their operation - does add a welcome dramatic tension to the otherwise typical western routine. It's fairly brightly lit which livens up the dark and gritty setting, and although on paper that might seem wrong, it does make everything easier to watch. There was significant effort put into the score and location sets, but it is a shame that the same effort wasn't put into the characters and screenplay. But then again those aren't reasons why people watch movies like LAWLESS.",Lawless

294,marksimmons-comedian,Mark Simmons- the uk's 3rd worst movie reviewer,8,13 September 2012,"A little joke to warm up the review:'If you really really like Bruce Willis and follow everything he is involved in does that make you a die-hard fan?' Lawless is set towards the end of the prohibition (Banned alcohol) and is the story of three brothers running a bootlegging business who are violently challenged by the new enforcement officer Charlie Rakes (Guy Pearce). The elder brother Forrest (Tom Hardy ) is the muscle of the operation and younger brother Jack (Shia LaBeouf) is keen to prove himself worthy of a more prominent role in the family business. Jack may not be as strong as his brothers but he has a lot of spirit which is very valuable as it was hard to get hold of alcohol during this time.If alcohol was banned today it would make many people very unhappy and would probably cause riots. I was wondering what the reaction was like when they announced the beginning of the prohibition in America in 1920 and whether the authorities announcing it to the crowd got any boos.This is a very violent movie with throat cutting, shootings, stabbings and torture. I asked my friend how Charlie Rakes tortures the Bondurant brothers cousin, he said he pours a boiling hot black liquid on him, I said Ta, he said yeah that's it.There is a scene where the Forest castrates a man who works for Charlie Rakes and then gives him the testicles as a means to intimidate. I was going to write a detailed section about this as I wondered what the best technique is to perform this operation but I decided to cut it.This is an excellent movie.

He had one of the best and memorable characters I've seen on the screen period.This movie made me think about life, and how its good to live a simple life without all the drama and stress. Its better to live a simple life without strife, than a live with physical riches and fighting and sorrow. The Bible says ""Fear of God is the beginning of Wisdom,"" despite how cowardice is looked upon now days, I am starting too see it as wisdom to have a good amount discretion and tact.

303,mjh12345,Another great performance by Tom Hardy,8,28 August 2012,"Just watched the movie this evening at a preview screening. I tend to go along to such screenings knowing very little about the films and thus no expectations. I hadn't even watched the trailer for Lawless, and if I'm honest I'm glad I didn't... I don't think the trailer does it justice.The cast is very good indeed, Guy Pearce plays a great part albeit with a suspect hairstyle, and I'm not Shia Labeouf's biggest fan but he does a pretty good job. Jason Clarke's character wasn't explored enough in my opinion and therefore I saw this as a negative on his part, seeing so little of him, however that might be down to the part itself and the fact I haven't seen him in anything previously.Tom Hardy plays a similar dark role to the one he plays in Warrior and he was awesome yet again. To think he's from London and he does the American 'drawl' so authentically in my opinion, albeit somewhat monosyllabic in parts- again consequence of his character.Frightening to think how brutal life was during the prohibition era in the USA. I'm not going to say too much about the content of the movie itself so as to not give anything away, but do yourself a favour and go along and give this movie a try. It's tough, gritty, quite gory, but it gave me that feeling leaving the cinema that a feel good movie does.",Lawless

I was happily surprised when Shia was unexpectedly great! I feel like he has really grown since the first Transformers. That being said, I also thought that the plot moved super fast for a western. I'm not complaining though - i'll call it a modern western. It pauses in the right places to really get the idea of what the characters are all about and you never really feel like the plot stalls. The best way I can think to describe it is almost like an accordion. Character interactions and developments are the slow intake of air, then the plot moves quickly to the next development as it collapses back down, waiting for the next development sequence. I scored this as an 8 because the plot, though well structured, was decently predictable. But hey, in this case predictable was certainly enjoyable! Until next time, Tuesday",Lawless
305,colby-morgan,Thrilling and engaging surprise,8,5 September 2012,"When I walked into the theatre for ""Lawless"", I honestly had very low expectations as a knowingly harsh film critic. However, once I experience around 15 minutes of the film, I knew that I was already engaged and totally surprised by a number of the performances and filming techniques done by John Hillcoat (known for average films such as ""The Road""). I'll start with the extreme positives. 1) Tom Hardy's performance: I had absolutely no idea what Hardy was going to do with this role (obviously I had just seen him as Bane in ""Dark Knight.."") but his subtle silences and ""huffs and puffs"" balanced his extreme violence and intimidation that drove the action sequences. Clearly, the intimidation factor was huge in this film. Hardy is never overacting in this role EVEN when he is in the most intense action sequences. His character, Forrest, has clearly been through this before countless times and he is almost too old for this sort of activity. 2) GUY PEARCE: I was shocked when I realized (about halfway through) that the actor playing Rakes was Pearce. He is very very creepy and, to be honest, the viewer wants him dead within the first 30 seconds of screen time. He looks strange and overconfident and doesn't respect anybody around him. This is of course, a bit too much on the surface but really helps drive the plot and the audience is always on the edge of their seat as to when Rakes is going to show up. 3) Shia shocker: I'm not a big Shia LaBeouf fan, but he presents innocence tremendously in this film. When placed in a line with his brothers, he looks as if he's around 13 years old. It's an excellent role to have in the film and his relationship with Bertha adds a little run and romance to a very thrilling film. So, clearly the major players in this film present excellent performances, but I have to be honest in saying that there were a couple interesting holes in the plot. By interesting I don't mean horrible, but there were moments where I scratched my head for a second as to how various elements put themselves together into a plot device (that's all I'll say for a lack of spoilers). OK SO-- I would highly recommend this to any 17-plus action movie lover because (as it is R-rated) there is BLOOD and VIOLENCE and excitement that kept me engaged even more than the 3- hour blockbuster ""Dark Knight..."" did a month ago.",Lawless
306,jghgt812,Lawless (A-),8,15 August 2012,"filmcahoots.com review of ""Lawless"" :I'm not too familiar with the work of director John Hillcoat, but the prohibition era in American history has always been a personal fascination of mine and so naturally I was excited to see ""Lawless"" as soon as I head what it was. My excitement rose even more when I leaned of its stellar cast and the fact the film would be shot all in Georgia. The film's protagonists are the Bondurant brothers, bootleggers in depression era Virginia trying to avoid law enforcement digging into their profits.""Forrest always said 'we was indestructible'"" –Jack Bondurant (Shia LeBeouf)A huge asset of the film is its development of the multiple complex characters. The characters are brilliantly executed with great performances by a very stoic Tom Hardy (who does perhaps the best southern accent in a film), Jessica Chastain, Mia Wasikowska, (in a small role) Gary Oldman, Jason Clarke, an extremely menacing Guy Pearce and yes even though he does not have much credit as far as acting skills go Shia LeBeouf has them and delivers a fine performance here (accent and all) which is needed for the weight of his role.The southern charm (portrayed excellently through period costumes, production design and period sounding music by Nick Cave (who I might add wrote the screenplay)) gives ""Lawless"" a very authentic and likable vibe. A vibe that director John Hillcoat feeds off of with his gritty visual style and well-pieced gangster romp scenes.The film might be about good ol' boys but it is very much a gangster film. I compare it a bit to ""Public Enemies"", ""Cop Land"" and ""Legends of the Fall"" but its overall balance of character depth, performances and direction make it it outshine them all.-Jacob Hillwww.filmcahoots.com",Lawless
307,marcwalden,A possible future classic,10,9 September 2012,"Firstly I'd like to point out that the trailer completely mis-sells this film. I went in expecting little story line and a host of big actors carrying through a flimsy plot line. How wrong I was! Tom Hardy is perfect as the reserved, cool and frighteningly twisted Forrest Bondurant, Gary Oldman, who given his billing I expected to be a second bad guy, hardly featured, but when he did he added a new dimension to the film, a view into the big bad gangsters in the city from the outside, which is not a perspective we are used to seeing.Guy Pearce is hateful, perverse and everything a truly bad guy should be, he had no redeeming features and you were not endeared to him in any way, you wanted him to be killed from the first moment he stepped on screen. Shia Le Bouef was a little better than his usual 1 dimensional acting will allow but he was still playing the part he plays best, weedy good guy with a heart, his love stories were a bit cheesy but he provided a lot of the humour in the film, The rest of the supporting cast is perfect such that you leave not knowing who the star was, and not caring how many big actors were cast in the film.The expression that sprang to mind was a modern day Scarface, brutal, vicious and starkly revealing, giving a unique perspective from the countryside and not shying away from any perversion or violence but each element pulled perfectly into a film which tells a story which draws you in and surprises you from start to finish. And the film had some truly hilarious moments, and they were intentional which helped relieve some of the drama and give you time to breath.Go and watch it, or you'll regret it.",Lawless
308,andypurcell1,Lawless has kicked off Oscar season,9,29 August 2012,"Set in Franklin County, Virginia, the plot focuses on the Bondurant brothers' exploits during the American Prohibition. Forrest (Tom Hardy) & Howard (Jason Clarke) Bondurant are feared yet respected in their local community, taking it upon themselves to prosper in the bootlegging business. The authorities do little less than encourage their illegal set-up; buying moon-shine from them in the opening scene was a subtle introduction to this concept. Jack Bondurant (Shia LaBeouf) is the youngest of the three brothers, desperately trying to get involved in the family business and prove himself as a man to his legendary brothers. LaBeouf's coming-of-age performance was surprisingly impressive, and although his character was used as light comic relief periodically, he showcased a range of talents we had yet to see from the 26-year-old.The Bondurant's cosy operation comes under threat when gangsters come sniffing around the area, using the corrupt Special Agent Charlie Rakes (Guy Pearce) to deliver an ill-informed ultimatum; pay for protection to continue the moon-shine business, or face the consequences of the law. The hostility is palpable throughout this significant scene as the offer is swiftly declined by the uncompromising Tom Hardy, and this leads to a series of brutal and violent exchanges that culminates with the extremely satisfying death of Oscar-worthy Guy Pearce, who makes hating a villain easier than ever with his grim yet ominous performance. A strong sense of certain morals and slowly blossoming romances for LaBeouf and Hardy gives the plot more depth and allows us to feel empathy for the law-breaking Bondurants, similar to Johnny Depp's character of John Dillinger in ""Public Enemies"".Hardy plays the oldest of the three brothers, Forrest, and is locally fabled as indestructible; throughout the film, he carries himself as if the legend is fact. Mindful of his performance as Bane in The Dark Knight Rises, Hardy strengthens his reputation with evident preparation and dedication to his role, and continued to impress with a convincing southern accent, and a natural ability to communicate and convey emotion through his characters' mannerisms.It's worth a mention that the exciting cast addition of Gary Oldman was slightly disappointing as his characters' screen time was minimal, although memorable. I think most will come out of the cinema wishing Oldman had more involvement in the overall plot.Lawless will surely be recognised as gangster classic as the years go by but keep in mind that it may not appeal to all as John Hillcoat (director) and Nick Cave (screenplay) have demanded the 18 rating that it has received with unforgettable scenes of violence. Having had the chance to see an advanced screening of the film that kicks off this years' Oscar season, I would recommend that anyone with an interest of this genre goes to see it as soon as you get the chance.",Lawless
309,adamjoyce-183-196608,"Good movie, but the story has greater potential.",7,28 November 2012,"This is a very good film, but I feel like the plot, setting, and cast could have been organized better. Tom Hardy is a good actor to play the tough guy character, but he rarely speaks in many of his movies, perhaps because he fails to articulate many words. I spent a lot of time trying to figure out what he was saying while watching this film. Shia LaBeouf was a good choice, but I feel like his character was painful to watch at times. If a more accomplished director took hold of this story, I think it would have made a very good film. Despite Hardy's mumbling dialogue and LaBeouf's very thick and somewhat inaccurate Franklin County dialect, this is a very entertaining film. I think that the fight scenes and the overall cinematography is wonderful. In my opinion, I think that the Coen brothers could have made this a very good southern themed film based off of their film O Brother Where Art Thou.

The gunfights are, for the majority, realistic, and the costumes and set dec accurate. While the film could have been about 20 minutes shorter, and the last twenty minutes was rushed, the story was intriguing. Unfortunately lack of proof on the brother's reputation caused a loss of faith in the characters.

312,mrsjdragon,"They managed to create a film that goes right in, but that without becoming banal",10,14 September 2012,"It is based on a true story and is about the three brothers Bondurant producing and selling booze during the Depression in the United States in the 1930s when it was forbidden. The film is made of the kind of narrative form where it is younger brother Jack who is talking. A short sequence in the beginning when children show the audience immediately how different brothers' characters are: Forrest, who is the oldest takes decisions, between brother Howard makes it necessary without much thought and Jack, who does not have the poker face for five cents or tough skin that was required in the typical environment.When the film gets rolling, they are considerably older and the focus is on those three in the family. (You can not see or hear about their parents) They run a restaurant / bar outside of town. Alcohol smuggling in their county is doing well and Chicago is close enough to pay attention to what is best in the neighborhood of spirit: brothers Bordurant. Yet Forrest refuses to deal with selling to the mob raging and sometimes shows up in town.In addition, an agent pops up and will put an end to the saling of moonshine once and for all. But man that pops up is not a common type of human. Agent Charlie Rakes makes it crawl into the skin and his increasingly irrational behavior increases during the movie. He is so unpleasant that I hear myself say at the end: Go on, shoot him!A clash is inevitable between agent Rakes and brothers Bordurant which thanks to Forrest repeatedly miraculous way to survive both the war and other incidents gave the brothers the fame of being immortal. Police are squashed between two camps: the law or society-and in the end they have to choose sides.All characters are incredibly well played, the humorous timing is always close to the blackness in the film and here's a movie where everything worked out for the best, all from the director to the actors and into the editingroom.

A strong cast, with many solid performances, although unfortunately not enough depth to leave a long-lasting impression.

That would mean, in my mind, better then 'Good Will Hunting', better than 'Watchmen', better than 'The Departed'. It isn't - but it's just as good. I went to see Lawless on my own at the Cinema yesterday (16/09/2012) - and can remember smiling to my self and thinking, ""this is one of those films that I've waited all my life to see"", just like those movies that I've just mentioned.

But much like Shia LeBeouf's first starring vehicle - - the HBO ""Project Greenlight"" film ""Battle for Shaker Heights"" -- this one suffers from the same lack of narrative arc and inability to decide what kind of film it wants to be.There are a half dozen potential plot lines that pop up and, for a split second, seem to be the point of choosing to tell this particular story (it is based on a real life family). But just as quickly they are dropped, never to be heard from again. You get the sense that there may be a lot of material on a cutting room floor somewhere that might have been assembled into a wholly different picture.The one thing the movie does accomplish is proving once again how supremely untalented Shia LeBeouf is as an actor. Other than the multitude of scenes where he is being beaten by one antagonist or another (he does take a convincing a** kicking) he comes across about as real as the CGI characters you normally see him playing against.Save your time and skip this one.",Lawless

A time without cell phones, Computers, internet, i-pods etc... A lifestyle with simple values. People living within their means, appreciating the basics and living in a era of depression, little means,and meager prospects. Bootlegging is an American tradition and this film provides a small peak behind the curtain of the ongoing corruption of Chicago politics, a time when guns were not evil, but ""PEOPLE"" were. Would have loved to step through the screen and lived during this era. The characters one either loves or hates, showing the excellent acting ability of those submerged in their roles. I have watched this film 3 times and counting. This film on a scale of 1 to 10 is a ""13 1/2"". No big special effects, lasers or ""techi"" language. Just a simple film depending upon the characters acting ability to sustain one's interest. For those who critique this film with comparisons to other films of the same genre, it may come up short. Not knowing the actors other roles, I was able to view this without prejudice.

325,mat009-626-708354,Lawless,5,6 March 2013,"MOVIE REVIEW Lawless (2012) By Matti DaniëlsWritten by Nick Cave and directed by John Hillcoat, is based on a true novel called 'The wettest county in the world'. The setting is spread out during the 1930's in Franklin County, during this time the daily business around this area mainly involved 'Bootlegging'. That's why it was also called ' A bloody paradise for bootleggers', because of the giant competitions between groups of bootleggers, which was always sort out by the use of a tommy gun or just blunt violence. At the center of this spiral of violence and alcohol are the three Bondurant brothers, whom upheld a strict code of certain honor and a stubborn independence. Although the movie is a very typical and original American story, the cast is one of the international kind; 'Tom Hardy' an English born actor, portraits the oldest of the three brothers 'Forrest' he is what you can call 'the keeper of values' he likes to maintain business within the family and by that he has a hard time coping with the fact that his other brothers doesn't share his opinion. The other member with international roots is the Australian actor 'Jason Clarke' playing the family drunk 'Howard' and enforcer of violence. To conclude our brothers, we have the always nervous and energetic Shia La Beaouf who plays the impulsive young brother 'Jack', whose dream it is to become a gangster like 'Pretty Boy Flloyd', portrayed by Gary Oldman, who is also an English born actor.The story itself is focused on the Bondurant brothers and how they systematic get a lot of opposition, when their bootlegging business goes out of control and becomes known among the gangster environment at that time. People like 'Pretty Boy Flloyd' become interested in the businesses of the Bondurants. Also a crooked cop from Chicago named 'Rakes' who is not only crooked but also a sadist with slick hair and striped suits, comes to join the party. Lawless is a mixture of black humor and violence, which combines perfectly with the performing cast.",Lawless

His accent was perfect, not over the top but realistic. He made a realistic Forrest and his grunts and ""erms"" kept me giggling! People are too judgemental on Shia I thought he really suited playing Jack and fitted the character perfectly! This film has a mix of romance, humour and a lot of action!

My wife bolted out of the room when we came to these scenes (I will not spoil it for people who have not yet watched the film). The message could have hit home without being so graphic.

Introduction of the characters was gradual and the conflict of the story was obvious from the beginning, but it was still fun to watch it develop. I think the one and only thing that bugged me the most was the immortal Tom Hardy. First surviving your neck being slit and then the multiple gun shots was just ridiculous. This was also one of the several moves that I thought Shia LeBeouf did a good job at playing his role. Part of me felt that there was a little Transformer left in his acting but other than that he did well fitting the part.

There was also a lot of drama in this movie if you like drama. Things you wouldn't expect to happen and twist that would leave your jaw dropping to the ground. This movie has a lot of emotional twist to it and might leave you crying or happy at the end. I would recommend this movie to my grandpa because he moved to America when the prohibition days were here in his teenage years. This isn't a good high school movie because, there was a lot of violence and stuff that falls away from prohibition to family related problems. This had nudity in it and some high school students can't handle being mature about these situations. The violence will have the girls probably scared about the thing that happen in this movie.

333,ellingsoeverett,Could be better,6,1 October 2015,"Franklin County, Virginia was at one time called ""the wettest county in the world"". It's also the setting for the film ""Lawless"". This film boasts gruesome reenactments of the life of ""moonshiners"" in the late 1920's and early 1930's. Director John Hillcoat did a wonderful job portraying the recklessness of the roaring 20's. Unfortunately, a combination of a confusing soundtrack, excessive violence and a dash of overacting diverts our attention from the main plot.The focus of the movie is young Jack Bondurant (Shia LaBeouf) and his struggle to get into the family business while earning some respect from his brothers Forest (Tom Hardy) and Howard (Jason Clarke). On his journey to becoming a backwoods gangster, Jack teams up with life long friend Cricket Pate (Dane DeHaan). The two friends seem to be making it until they run into some bigger fish in the ever- shrinking pond of Franklin County. Included in this gun slinging action movie are a couple of love stories that make for some interesting scenes.The soundtrack to this movie is a little inconsistent. At times, the music just doesn't match the emotions that are being acted out on screen. Then, other times it matches our emotions perfectly. Scenes could have been made to feel more personable if the soundtrack was better. On a more positive note, the setting, set design, costumes and makeup were phenomenal. Throughout the movie, we see most of the men in three-piece suits showing us they have plenty of money from the illegal sale of alcohol. Even the cars in the movie mirror the reputation of the invincible and untouchable Bondurant family. Clearly, the prohibition era was a time where gun slinging outlaws and corrupt officials were the norm. As the title says, there were no ""laws"" for these bootleggers. With that being said, the amount of violence in this film seems a little bit excessive. There are huge amounts of blood, beatings and even some severed body parts. It all just seems a little unnecessary. It does show that the Bondurant's are not to be messed with. Too bad it also makes the plot difficult to follow. Unfortunately, the acting in this movie is really pulling it down like an anchor. Shia LaBeouf and Dane DeHaan are two of the star actors in this film. Oddly enough, they're the guys that have the most unreal and awkward dialogues. For example, Jack sees Floyd Banner shoot someone in the middle of town. He runs to Cricket's house to tell him what he just witnessed. The scene is going well until Jack starts yelling Crickets name. It sounds like LaBeouf is just forcing his accent too much and it has no natural flow. It seems minor, but it all adds up and by the end of the movie it's just annoying.Overall, this film could have been put together more effectively, but overall Hillcoat did a pretty good job making a prohibition era love story action movie. With less violence, a better thought out soundtrack and more natural acting, this movie would be outstanding. Instead, it is relatively entertaining to watch and may inspire you to purchase a Thompson sub-machine gun, a three-piece suit and a felt hat. Just remember no one will ever be as invincible as the Bonderant's.",Lawless

Sad thing is, for some reason, The Oscars and Academy Awards just WONT recognize his amazing talent. Love you Tom Hardy and love this movie. Will be watching it and re-watching it over and over :)",Lawless
335,amirhamzasonet,One of the best I have ever watched,7,9 May 2017,"It is about three brothers who are running an illegal but successful business which soon attracts attention they don't want and trouble ensues. There is quite a lot of action in this film but it is mostly about the drama and the different things each character goes through. There are some fantastic actors in this film who all show their versatility and most notable for me was Tom Hardy and Shia LaBeouf who did an amazing job of making their characters real to the audience and made you really care for them. It is quite a long film but so many different things happen and it kept me glued from start to finish. There are some very grim scenes, some intense action, emotional scenes and of course romance and even a few comical moments - I think this film has a bit of everything. This film is not all about the action so don't expect it to be, but the main element is the theme of brotherhood which I loved. Also the fact that Lawless is based on a true story made it really interesting for me.",Lawless
336,ashcoopswr,"Gritty, revenge, violence",10,18 March 2019,I have to say this is one of the best films I have ever seen. The suspense is intense. The dialogue between the characters is really interesting to watch. Shia Lebouf has definitely shown another side to his acting rather than the usual cliche films. There's nothing tom hardy cant do. Even when he's not talking he's saying so much through them eyes. Jessica chastain holding the brothers together. And a special mention to guy pearce. Transforming into that role is genius.,Lawless
