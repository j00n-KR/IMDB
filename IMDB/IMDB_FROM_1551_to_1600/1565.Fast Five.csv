0,Leofwine_draca,"Pretty, but soulless with it",5,1 February 2014,"I have to say I was disappointed by FAST FIVE. I've been deriving minor enjoyment from these movies since they began, and I'd heard good things about this movie; how it had less CGI, how it was bigger, better and more intense as an action flick. Well, the good news is that it feels fresher in that it veers off in a slightly different direction in that it's not ALL about the car chases this time around, but it still feels lacklustre and less than the sum of its parts.The problem with this film is that the franchise is just getting too big and too sluggish now. There are too many guys in the team, too many of whom are token ethnic or misplaced comic relief. It means that few of the principle cast get much screen time. Vin Diesel is hulking and kind, but never gets a chance to emote. The Rock, as the new participant, bags the best role, but really the film is about those two guys and that's it. Paul Walker seems bored and the likes of Sung Kang barely register.The plot feels like something from the recent Italian Job and GONE IN 60 SECONDS remakes with the team assembling in Brazil to rip-off a drugs lord. Despite the huge budget and plethora of car-smashing stunts, it's never as exciting as I'd hoped it would be; the viewer feels detached from the action, set back and never as fully involved as he is in a really good action movie (like a Bourne film; I'm thinking in particular of the climactic car chase in THE BOURNE SUPREMACY). I'll keep watching these, but I hope number six gets a few more things right.",Fast Five
1,SnoopyStyle,More action than anybody can possibly expect,7,23 February 2014,"Following the previous installment, Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) and Mia Toretto (Jordana Brewster) breaks out her brother Dom (Vin Diesel) from the prison transport. They escape to Rio de Janeiro. Running low on cash, they do a job with Vince to steal cars from a train. However everything goes wrong. Three DEA agents are killed, and the three escapees get blamed. They find a chip in the car that shows where master criminal Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida) has hidden his $100 million. Meanwhile DSS agent Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) has arrived to catch the three and bring them back to justice. He takes uncorrupted local cop Elena Neves (Elsa Pataky) as his translator. Instead of running away, the three decide to call in reinforcements to pull off the greatest robbery ever.Director Justin Lin is bringing more action than ever. The addition of big action star The Rock just raises the bar that much higher. It starts with a great car-train action scene. Then a foot chase in the barrios looks incredible. That's barely half of it. I do wish the story be simplified even more. Most people watch this for the action, not for the story. This is a movie that delivers the action and exceeds the expectations.",Fast Five
2,boblipton,The Fifth Time They Pull Their Last Job,5,16 October 2021,"Vin Diesel is broken out of prison by the usual gang. With Dwayne Johnson in hot pursuit, they head off to Rio De Janeiro, where they steal some hot cars in the first practical effects showpiece. They turn out to belong to druglord Joaquim de Almeida; they discover he stored all his extensive papers detailing his evil empire and a hundred million dollars in cash in one of the cars, as one does, and decide to steal that for the second big practical effects showpiece as yet another last job they'll ever do.There are some fine performers here, but the cars are the real stars, and more work is done to make sure you can hear the engines than the dialogue. No one in the intended audience has ever heard of a muffler apparently. Still, the things they put these cars through is astonishing, if you like that sort of thing. Given that it has taken me ten years to see this hit movie, should give you an idea of how I feel about the matter.",Fast Five
3,claudio_carvalho,The Day When Puerto Rico Has Become Rio de Janeiro,6,17 September 2011,"The former agent Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) and his girlfriend Mia Toretto (Jordana Brewster) rescue her brother Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) during the transportation to the prison and they flee to Rio de Janeiro. They rob a car from custody and find that the powerful drug lord Hernan Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida) has a US$ 100,000.00 in a safe located inside the police station and protected by corrupt policeman. Dominic invites his skilled crew to steal the dirty money and achieve their freedom, moving to a country without extradition to the USA. Meanwhile the tough FBI agent Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) comes to Brazil with an elite force to arrest Dominic and Brian.""Fast Five"" is an entertaining action film, with cartoonish shootings and fights and an insane car race that destroys dozens of cars and locations. Vin Diesel, Paul Walker and Dwayne Johnson are synonym of great action scenes, and is nice to see the gorgeous Jordana Brewster that speaks a perfect Portuguese and Elsa Pataky.For Brazilian and specially ""cariocas"" (natives from Rio de Janeiro), this film is also a comedy with the stereotyped Rio and a great quantity of mistakes. Most of the scenes are shot in Puerto Rico; most of the accent of actors speaking Portuguese are not from Rio but from São Paulo or from native in Spanish; Hernan Reyes is not a Brazilian name and Joaquim de Almeida is an actor from Portugal; there are ridiculous geographical mistakes, like for example, the references to the noble areas of Avenida Atlântica and Leblon. The sequences in the slums are also funny, since the modus operandi of armed drug dealers is totally different, using snipers from the top of the hills and barriers in the accesses to avoid the police and paramilitary forces. An American force would never have jurisdiction in Brazil. Last but not the least, there are many corrupt cops in Brazil, but never in such level. I do not understand why the production has not used Brazilian actors and actresses in supporting roles to giver credibility to the footages with the external landscapes of Rio de Janeiro. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Velozes & Furiosos 5 - Operação Rio"" (""Fast & Furious 5 – Operation Rio"")",Fast Five
4,nogodnomasters,In a World Where Frictional Coefficients Don't Exist,9,24 January 2018,"** MINOR PLOT SYNOPSIS (MINUS ENDING)**Vin Diesel is busted out of prison and is reunited with his sister Jordana Brewster (who I fell in love with in D.E.B.S.) and her bf Paul Walker in Rio, the most recognized skyline in the world. They are bad guys stealing cars off a train. As things turned out, these were cars seized by the Brazilian DEA, who for some reason unlike their American counterparts don't disable the vehicles. Due to infighting, the effort is partially botched and Vin Diesel and Walker end up as captives of a Rio mobster. They discover he wants one of the cars back real bad. After they escape they dismantle the car to find out way.Meanwhile Dwayne Johnson comes down from the US to take back Vin Diesel. It seems the US has jurisdiction in Brazil, but hey its a movie. From a chip in the vehicle, Vin Diesel discovers that the crime boss has money stored in various cash houses throughout the city. Walker and Vin Diesel assemble a Mission Impossible team to go after the cash. They attack the first cash house and burn the money which forces the mobster to relocate all his eggs into one basket. As it turns out, that basket is inside the evidence safe at the police station, making the task of that one last hit a bit more difficult. At this point the movie takes a few interesting twists and turns.The plot contains numerous implausibilities as does most Mission Impossible action movies, vehicles that can bust through concrete walls (that never use rebar), and don't even scratch the head lights. The ending will keep Myth Busters busy for a season.",Fast Five
5,kosmasp,Quite a lot,7,26 December 2011,"And I am not referring to the number of movies the ""Fast and Furious"" franchise has built up to now. I am talking about the actors involved in this. Which leads me to the conclusion that Justin Lin must have done quite a lot things right too. Not only does he return again and again to the franchise (it's his third time at the helm), but he brings back a lot of people you'll recognize from the previous movies.That of course means, that you might want to freshen up your memory and re-watch the previous movies. Yes even the ""Tokyo Drift"" one! A new face is Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson of course. And while he's not quite Tommy Lee Jones (as seen in ""The Fugitive""), he brings a lot to this movie! All the actors do not count of course, if the action isn't right. And you have some very nice set pieces here, very well choreographed. A real fun ride then. Of course you can tell that this won't be the last one (stay and watch until the end credits roll through to get a tag end/scene), so I do wonder, since the title get smaller and smaller, will they call the next one ""F-Six""? And then ""F7""?! But until then, enjoy the movies as much as you can :o) (just don't try it at home/on the streets yourself!)",Fast Five
6,jboothmillard,Fast Five,7,8 October 2015,"This was the fifth film in the non-stop high octane franchise full of cool and fast cars racing and chasing each other, including lots of action and some stunts along the way, directed by Justin Lin (The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift, Fast & Furious 4 and 5). Basically Dominic ""Dom"" Toretto (Vin Diesel) is being transported to prison, but his sister Mia (Jordana Brewster) and friend Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) cause the bus to crash, allowing Dom to escape, the authorities begin a search for them, the trio meanwhile travel to Rio de Janeiro. They join their friend Vince (Matt Schulze) to participate in a job to try and steal three cars from a train, it is discovered that U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agents are on the train, then they end up getting captured by right-hand man Zizi (Michael Irby) and his henchmen, bringing them to crime lord Herman Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida), but they manage to escape and get to their safe house. Brian, Dom and Mia investigate the importance of the one car Reyes was trying to get his hands on, a computer chip is found in it, looking at this Brian discovers details of Reyes' criminal empire, including the locations of 100 million U.S. dollars in cash. Diplomatic Security Service agent Luke Hobbs (Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson) is assigned to find and arrest Dom and Brian, they are found, but the safe house is also surrounded by Reyes' men, Dom suggests splitting up as they make their escape, but Mia reveals she is pregnant with Brian's child, they stick together and form a plan to steal the millions of dollars. Organising a team, with some old friends, including Tej Parker (rapper Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges), Roman Pearce (Transformers' Tyrese Gibson), Han (The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift's Sung Kang), Gisele Yashar (Gal Gadot), Tego Leo (Tego Calderón) and Rico Santos (rapper Don Omar), they form a plan to steal the $100 million and split an equal share, this will enable them all to start new lives. After some time planning the infiltration of Heyes' building, stealing the safe containing the millions, and cracking it open, and of course training with very fast cars to pass security cameras, the team are ready to carry out the robbery, when Hobbs and his team catch up to them. Dom, Mia, Brian and Vince are found and arrested, being transported to the airport the convoy is attacked by Reyes' men, Hobbs' men are killed, but the four save Hobbs and officer Elena Neves (Elsa Pataky), Vince is shot and killed, but they escape the attack, and Hobbs and Elena agree to help with the heist. The gang break into the police station and steal the vault holding Heyes' money, dragging it through the city, the police chase them, Brian is able to kill Zizi in the pursuit, Hobbs arrives on the scene and kills an injured Reyes, and he gives Brian and Dom a head start to escape, but only if they leave the vault. However during the chase the team were able to switch the real vault with one looking identical, the cash is split between the team, including Vince's family getting his share, they all do their separate ways, on a tropical beach Brian is relaxing with a visibly pregnant Mia, and Dom arrives with Elena, Brian and Dom challenge each other to a final no-stakes race, for old times. In the post-credits sequence Hobbs is trying to catch up with the heist gang, Monica Fuentes (Eva Mendes) hands him a file concerning a hijack in Berlin, it shows a recent photograph of Dom's former girlfriend Leticia ""Letty"" Ortiz (Michelle Rodriguez), who was presumed dead (following the events of Fast & Furious), this will continue in the following film. Also starring Alimi Ballard as Fusco, Fernando Chien as Wilkes, Yorgo Constantine as Chato and Geoff Meed as Macroy. From the fourth film onwards the series changed in mood and style, it may feel different but in a way it's more modern, the plot bringing back familiar past characters for a great fast-paced heist is great fun. To be honest, the storyline going on is not the thing to pay the fullest attention to, it is the pedal-to-the-metal stuff, all the colourful and cool cars fuelled up, with extra rocket boosters and switches, that speed and crash their way around, and the explosions and stunts along the way keep the pace up as well, all in all it's a most entertaining action thriller. Very good!",Fast Five
7,Tweekums,Fast & Furious 5,8,13 February 2017,"After Brian and Mia help Dom Toretto escape from a prison transport the three of them flee to Rio de Janeiro where they meet Dom's old friend Vince. He has a job for them; steal some fast cars that are being transported by train what none of them know is that the cars have been seized by the US DEA and the person wanting them stolen is local drug lord Hernan Reyes. It becomes apparent that they are only really after one of the cars. Dom and his friends take that car and discover why it is so important; the chip in the car's GPS system includes data that gives the location of all the locations where Reyes stores his ill earned money. Dom decides that they will steal the lot but before they do that they will have to assemble a team of specialists. He and Brian will also have to avoid capture by agent Luke Hobbs and his team who believe Dom and Brian were responsible for the deaths of DEA agents on the train.This is a fine fifth instalment in this apparently endless franchise. This one is less about cars than the previous films although they obviously play a key role. Instead we get more conventional action with fighting, shootouts and finally an impressive heist. The action is nicely spread throughout the film and is suitably varied. It all leads to a spectacular, if somewhat unlikely, chase where Dom, Brian and the team race away from countless corrupt Rio cops and Reyes' men while dragging a massive vault through Rio leaving a trail of destruction as they go. Vin Diesel and Paul Walker have developed a great chemistry over course of the series and are on top form here. Dwayne Johnson is a welcome addition to the cast as Hobbs as is Elsa Pataky as Brazilian police officer Elena Neves; hopefully both will return in future instalments; the ending suggests that they probably will. The Rio setting is used well without overdoing the 'Tourist Board' shots. As well as great action there are some good laughs; the black guy claiming to be a while guy with a 'great tan' was hysterical as the line was so well delivered. I'd certainly recommend this film to anybody who loves over-the-top action but don't want anything too unpleasant.",Fast Five
8,BA_Harrison,Vin Diesel vs The Rock.,6,22 July 2018,"Fast & Furious 5 steers the series even further away from 'car-porn' and into more accessible over-the-top summer blockbuster territory. This one even has The Rock in it!The film opens as part four closed, with Dom's team rescuing their friend while he is en route to prison by orchestrating a bus crash that, in reality, would kill everyone inside. Of course, by now, reality has nothing to do with the Fast & Furious franchise: this is a preposterous slam-bang spectacle that would have left me with a big grin on my face if it hadn't been so drawn out. At well over two hours, part 5 is at least thirty minutes longer than it needed to be. Trim the fat and it might have been the most enjoyable one so far.Anyway, with Dom free (and somehow devoid of any injuries), the action moves to Brazil where the team decide to pull another car robbery (from a speeding train, no less). Lots of mayhem ensues, with more death defying stunts, after which the crew discover a computer chip hidden inside one of the vehicles that details the activities of Rio De Janeiro's top crime lord. Armed with this information, the gang decide to pull one more heist: steal the bad guy's money - all $100million of it. Meanwhile, top US agent Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) is on their trail.Unfortunately, the preparation for the daring raid is where things tend to drag (although we do get to see Gal Gadot in a small bikini, so it's not all bad). The film does, however, eventually culminate in one of the craziest heist scenes in cinema, with Dom and Brian dragging a humongous metal safe around the streets of Rio, laying waste to buildings and cars in the process. Oh, and there's a car with a mini-gun that pops out of the sun roof! All of this is mindless popcorn fun if you can check your sense of logic at the door on the way in - it's just a shame that getting there is a bit of a slog at times.",Fast Five
9,paul_haakonsen,Vroom vroom... strap yourself in for a fast-paced ride...,7,22 August 2011,"Having seen the previous four movies in the series, I can't really claim to be a fan, yet here I am again, sitting down to watch another of these movies. Now, I am not a fan of fast cars, street racing, nor of Vin Diesel, but there is just something about this 5th installment of the series that works so well.Of all the movies so far, this part is the one with the most interesting and solid storyline. Sure, it was pretty far out there at times, but in overall, it did work quite well. The movie has lots of action, fast paced scenes and racing, impressive cars, and a load of really good shots of Rio.From the very beginning of the movie, you are in for a thrill-ride, and it doesn't stop until the movie is over and the credits start scrolling. You will be riveted in your chair by this movie, that much is certain. What I liked was that the heist was more a focal point of the movie, as compared to the fancy cars.The chase scene on foot through the narrow, winding streets, alleys and rooftops of Rio was mind-blowing. That was, for me at least, perhaps the most action packed scene of the movie. It was just so intense. It was like you were there yourself.And the scene where they had the vault dragging after them, well it was a bit too much, a tad over the top, but it was still nice though. Yet, how very, very odd that it was only police casualties and no civilian casualties in this scene. That was just not cool. Hadn't seen something like that in a movie before, so it was impressive to see, and it looked awesome. But I think once a vault that size would get into motion and swing about, the cars would be pulled with it, and not be able to steer it around and maneuver it like they were doing. But hey, this is a movie after all.The acting in the movie was good, despite me not being a fan of Vin Diesel, then he did do it well enough. As did the other people on the cast list. It was cool to see Dwayne Johnson in this movie, though I didn't really buy into it when his character joined up with the criminals. That was just too unreal.If they manage to keep up this level of intensity and action in the 6th part, scheduled for 2013, then we will certainly be in for one impressive ride.For a non-particular fan of the ""Fast and Furious"" series, this 5th installment impressed me quite a lot.",Fast Five
10,BandSAboutMovies,Now they are supercops,5,6 August 2020,"Somehow, the street gang from the first film has become almost like G.I. Joe in these movies. This film - the fifth as you can tell by the title - tells the story of Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel), Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) and Mia Toretto (Jordana Brewster) as they steal $100 million while being pursued by U.S. Diplomatic Security Service agent Luke Hobbs (Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson). This is the film that moved from street races to big action scenes and fans went wild.The film starts by having Dom busted out of prison by the gang and ends with the Rock showing that he just might join these guys, which includes Tyrese Gibson as Roman Pearce, Ludacris as Tej Parker, Matt Schulze as Vince, Sung Kang as Han Lue and Gal Gadot as Gisele Yashar.This is also where the movies start feeling bloated, pushing themselves past a two-hour running time. The other criticism is that women barely have names and are just sex objects in these films. Hell, they don't even tell you what Gal Gadot's character's name - Gisele - is for the entire movie!One of the good things is that these films have minimal CGI and rely mostly on practical effects for the car stunts.Also - that scene where they found out that Letty is alive? Michelle Rodriguez didn't know anything about it until she saw the movie in a theater.",Fast Five

12,zardoz-13,"""Mission Impossible"" Meets ""Ocean's Eleven"" On Hot Wheels!",9,9 May 2011,"As the fourth sequel in ""The Fast and the Furious"" franchise, ""Five Fast"" combines elements of a Tom Cruise ""Mission Impossible"" epic as well as the George Clooney, Brad Pitt & Matt Damon ""Ocean's Eleven"" outings. Our high-octane protagonists have fled south to Rio de Janeiro. They plan to steal a fortune in cold cash from Brazil's most dangerous man because he has framed them for murder. Swift, swerving, snappy reflex driving constitutes an integral part of this careening carefree narrative. Mind you, the larger-than-life heist and the way our heroes not only prepare but also pull it off absorbs about half of the film's brisk 130 minutes. Justin Lin and his three-time ""Fast and Furious"" collaborator scenarist Chris Morgan have raised the stakes again so they can top ""Fast & Furious"" and they've done a splendid job of topping the previous epic. When Dominic Toretto and Brian O'Conner aren't tangling with murderous Brazilian thugs, they must contend with an incorruptible good guy. Tenacious Federal agent Luke Hobbs (Dwayne 'the Rock' Johnson of ""Doom"") vows to hunt them down and apprehend them and he never quits. Literally, our heroes are between a 'Rock' and a hard place! ""The Fast and the Furious"" franchise has evolved over the last decade from illegal street racing done in conjunction with some crime. Initially, the speeders hijacked eighteen-wheelers for their loads. Since ""Fast & Furious,"" they have involved themselves in bigger crimes. The life & death heist here is as outlandish as it is audacious. Indeed, ""Fast Five"" surpasses ""Fast & Furious"" for no other reason than its final 30 minutes overshadows everything before it. No, Toretto and O'Connor couldn't have gotten away with their ambitious scheme in real life any more than they could navigate those tunnels without accident in ""Fast & Furious."" Nevertheless, Lin and Morgan make their strenuous efforts look like a lot of fun, something that the tunnel racing sequences lacked.""Fast Five"" opens where ""Fast & Furious"" ended. Dominic 'Dom' Toretto (Vin Diesel of ""xXx"") has been sentenced to 25 years in Lompoc prison. Former FBI agent Paul O'Connor (Paul Walker of ""Into the Blue"") and Dom's sister Mia (Jordana Brewster of ""Annapolis"") along with another driver wreck the prison bus in route so Dom can escape. Incredibly, nobody is hurt in the accident. The opening gambit in the previous movie ""Fast & Furious"" was so good it made the rest of it appear anti-climactic, but this isn't the case in ""Fast Five."" Indeed, Lin and Morgan top themselves in ""Fast Five."" Once O'Connor and Mia have Dom sprung, they are approached by Dom's childhood friend Vince (Matt Schulze of ""Blade 2"") about a railroad heist where they will steal some sports cars. This heist recalls the opening gambit in ""Fast & Furious."" A wrecker cruises up alongside a train. The thieves cut an oblong hole in the freight car containing the vehicles. They catapult the cars out sideways onto the wrecker's ramp and then lower the ramp so the drivers can back down off it and peel away in a cloud of dust. Of course, nothing can go smoothly in a heist movie. Our heroes discover the DEA has impounded the cars and their native gun-toting accomplices refuse to let the DEA thwart them. The Brazilian gunmen kill the DEA agents without a qualm, while our heroes are incriminated for the killings. Dom helps O'Connor get off the train, but Dom has to plummet his convertible into a river. They jump for their lives.The Feds dispatch Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson of ""Faster"") to capture Toretto and O'Connor. Meanwhile, Dom concocts an incredible plan to take over a $100-million from the man whose killers gunned down the DEA agents. In South America, crooked entrepreneur Hernan Reyes (Joaquim de Almedia of ""Desperado"") rules the country. Reyes gets whatever he demands. Our heroes find a computer chip in a confiscated Reyes' sports cars. The chip contains a treasure-trove of information about all of Reye's cash stashes. Dom urges them to pull 'one last job' and rob Reyes blind. Our protagonists assemble a racing team that includes O'Connor's childhood friend Roman Pearce (Tyrese Gibson of ""2 Fast 2 Furious""), Tej Parker (Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges of ""2 Fast 2 Furious""), Han Lue (Sung Kang of ""Tokyo Drift""), former Israeli intelligence agent Gisele Harabo (Gal Gadot of ""Fast & Furious""), and a couple of others. Dom and company strike the first of Reye's safe houses. Reye's men watch in horror as our heroes burn the money. Immediately, Reye relocates his fortune to the downtown police station. He locks it up in a vault that can only be opened with his hand print. If you've seen the trailer for ""Fast Five,"" you know they steal the entire vault and then drag it like a wrecking ball through town so the finale looks like a demolition derby.Ultimately, ""Fast Five"" is about having a good time. Again, the heroes are the underdogs, while the villains are thoroughly treacherous. The Rock shows up as a good guy caught in the crossfire. He is wants to capture our heroes because they are his quarry. Of course, the fast driving scenes thrive on adrenalin-pacing. The numerous gunfights are noisy enough with everybody blasting away at each without blinking. ""Fast Five"" reunites virtually everybody and then some who have survived all previous epics. Naturally, the Brazilian scenery is fabulous, and ""Fast Five"" serves as a travelogue when Lin and Morgan aren't wrapping expository scenes about the heist around our ears. A mindless epic about motorized mayhem, ""Fast Five"" springs some surprises that change everything that will make you yearn for a fifth sequel. Be advised, don't leave the theater until the entire end credits roll, you're definitely in for a shock.",Fast Five
13,neil-476,Fifth is good,8,21 April 2011,"One normally expects the law of diminishing returns to set in with sequels. But Fast Five is fine.Diesel, Walker & Co are in Rio looking for a big score, with Dwayne Johnson's crack team looking to bring them back to answer for various crimes (the fact that these guys have no jurisdiction in Rio is mentioned, but otherwise overlooked).There are a couple of excellent set pieces bookending some entertaining character stuff and plot movement. And when I say ""excellent"", what I mean is not very probable, but immensely entertaining, with brilliant stunt work interlaced with visual effects so well that you can't tell which is which.I thoroughly enjoyed this.",Fast Five
14,Uriah43,Heading Down to Rio de Janeiro,5,23 April 2017,"This film takes up where its predecessor (""Fast & Furious"") left off with ""Dominic Toretto"" (Vin Diesel) being hauled away in a bus on his way to prison. However, before Dominic can be transported to his destination his sister, ""Mia Toretto"" (Jordana Brewster) and the former undercover agent named ""Brian O'Connor"" (Paul Walker) intercept the bus and rescue him. Knowing that they cannot remain in the United States any longer the three of them head down to Rio de Janeiro and resume their usual operations there. Not long after arriving they team up with an extremely corrupt politician named ""Reyes"" (Joaquim de Almeida) who then attempts to double-cross them. Fortunately, Dominic is prepared for this and skillfully manages to turn the tables on Reyes by escaping in a special car which has a valuable computer chip that details Reyes' entire operation. Needless to say, Reyes wants that chip back at all costs and immediately sends his men to capture Dominic and his crew so that he can interrogate and subsequently kill them once he has it. What nobody realizes is that a special agent has been sent from the United States named ""Luke Hobbs"" (Dwayne Johnson) who also has orders to capture Dominic and Brian as well. To that end, neither Reyes nor Luke Hobbs are easily deterred. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that--while this was definitely an entertaining action film--it suffered from one major flaw in that it had too many high-speed stunts which were simply too ridiculous and improbable to be believed. It was just too much. Be that as it may, I liked the addition of Dwayne Johnson who definitely added something extra to the film. Likewise, having three attractive actresses like Gal Gadot (as ""Gisele""), Elsa Pataky (""Elena"") and the aforementioned Jordana Brewster certainly didn't hurt either. That being said, even though this movie would have been much better if the director (Justin Lin) hadn't gotten so carried away with everything, it was still an okay sequel and I have rated it accordingly.

15,morrison-dylan-fan,Five By Five.,9,22 April 2011,"When I heard that a fifth film in the Fast And Furious franchise was getting made,I have to admit that my original feeling was one of mild interest at most.This is because I felt that when the third film in the series came out (Tokyo Drift) it seemed that the film makers had taken most of the energy out of the series,which made the film feel a lot less exciting than its predecessors.Whilst the fourth film gave the series a slight return to form,by bringing back some of the past cast members,the performances seemed to have lost something that was there in the first film,with Vin Diesels performance losing some of the charming cockiness that had made Dominic Toretto such a engaging character.When my friend saw some clips of the film,that showed The Rock was going to have a big role in the film,he (who is also a big fan of this series) was instantly looking forward to seeing this film.And for my self,I felt that since this was Rocks first ""big budget"" non-Disney film in a long time,and that it seemed from some of the clips I had seen that, the cast and crew had found their passion again for the series.This got me to start thinking the this was a film that could really surprise me...plot: Arriving to Rio De Janeiro to meet up again with street-racer Dominic Toretto,who they have recently help escape from jail,Brian O'Conner and Dominics sister Mia are surprised to find that he is no where to be seen.When they visit one of there's (and Dominics) mutual friends (Vince),they are surprised to discover that Vince needs them to help him with a planned robbery of a very valuable car, that is being transported in a highly secure train.As the team start to ambush the train,Dominc makes a surprise arrival,and starts to help the others to literally rip a carriage of the train into two!.When the gang get on to the remaining parts of the train,they are shocked that along with the big amount of thugs that are trying to keep the car secure,there are also a good number of ""off-duty"" DEA agents there as well.Realiseing that time is running out,Vince tells the gang that they have to only steal one of the cars.Whilst the gang try to get away,three of the DEA agents are killed in the cross-fire between the thugs and Dominics gang.After having spilt up and seeming to be safe,Dominic and O'Conner are suddenly captured by the most powerful boss in the De Janeiro underworld (Hernan Reyes) who questions them for hours about where they have hidden the car,When they both at last escape from Reyes hideout,they go to meet up with Mia,whose been keeping the car hidden in a safe house.To an extremely angry Dominic,Vince gives everyone the shock announcement that he knew that Reyes would do everything he can to kill each member of the gang,so that he could get hold of the car again.Vince also tells them that Hernan does not want the car itself,but what is hidden inside it (a computer chip,which has all the details of Reyes money-laundering safe houses,which he partly uses to keep the police in his control)Hearing this,Dominic tells Vince that he can not be trusted and that he must leave the gang.Vince reluctantly does,as Dominic and everyone else start to get there old friends to join them,so that they can do a huge heist,by taking every penny of Reyes dirty money.But with Hernans money now being kept safe at the main police station ,and a DSS federal agent (Luke Hobbs) now searching for them,due to all of them being framed for the murders of the agents,this heist is going to be far from easy...View on film: For the screenplay,writer Chris Morgan brilliantly changes the format of the series,by having the cops 'n' robbers storyline that has been the main plot (s) of the series,instead become a fun secondary story,with the main plot line instead being about a huge heist.Morgans brilliant script keeps the film moving at a fantastic pace, with the clever introduction of (all the main) characters from the last four films being woven together into a team that any viewers of the past films will be unable to not let a big grin go across their face,Morgan also smartly makes it that each member of the team plays a vital part in the mission going successfully. Whilst he may have reallied on CGI effects a bit too much the last few times,director Justin Lin brings the film back to it roots with a BANG.Although some of the things that are used for the heist (such as the pulling cables) seem to have come straight out of Chris Morgans script for Wanted,Lin makes the amazing action scenes extremely gripping by having the epic heist chase feel very rough and raw,with the beautiful Brazil location being completely destroyed into dust!.Although he sadly delivers his last few lines (which I hope are there to show that he will be returning for the next films)in a more joking manner,when the character really needed to show some real aggression,Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson is still able to give his best performance that I have seen from him in years,with Johnson making your eyes transfix on the screen,as he shows an unforgettable amount of charisma,that turned him into an icon in his previous job as, Luke Hobbs tears everything (and everyone) apart so that he can get closer to finding out about what is really happening in Rio.Along with having one of the best on screen fights of the year with Johnson,Vin Diesel gives a fantastic,real return-to-form performance as Dominic.Diesel shows that even though Dominic is older,he is still able to keep his quick-witted ideas and fearlessness burning,when everyone else has run out of fuel,although Diesel also smartly shows that Dominic is more open to listening to other peoples plans and compromising, than he ever was before.",Fast Five
16,anaconda-40658,Leave Five Times Faster.,2,3 June 2015,"Fast Five (2011): Dir: Justin Lin / Cast: Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Jordana Brewster, Tyrese Gibson, Dwayne Johnson: Another tire screeching waste of time. The title only references the fact that there is five of these dreadful road kill movies. There are certainly more than five drivers. It basically assembles a bunch of guys from earlier films whose careers were obviously going nowhere for them all to agree to this garbage. Director Justin Lin previously made the two sequels before this, Tokyo Drift and Fast and Furious and despite the massive stunts and car wrecking action the screenplays brings nothing new to the situation other than being set in South America where they all hide out. Vin Diesel announces that there will be one more job and it will involve a clash with corrupt law enforcement. Dwayne Johnson is featured as a law official whose presence only serves as an opportunity to have him scrap it out with Diesel. Paul Walker and Jordana Brewster also return and apparently he knocked her up and a child is on the way. Outside of that they sustain no personalities. Then there is a whole slew of people from previous films including Tyrese Gibson whose work in Baby Boy is a far cry to the crap he does here. Dwayne Johnson plays a muscle bound cop whose role consists of being in a brawl with Diesel. These films are pretty much all the same with just a change in location to add any difference. With all the dangerous driving in society one would imagine that this junk would be taken a tad more seriously but it serves only as entertainment fit to be crushed underneath the screeching rubber.

And at the same time, Luke Hobbs, a government agent who specialises in tracking down fugitives, arrives in Brazil and is determined to get them......Much like phase two of the Marvel movies, Fast and Furious Mach 2 gets bonkers as the series goes on. The fourth movie resurrected the ailing franchise back from the dead, and it made a bucketload, so it would have been silly to leave it there.Well it starts literally where the fourth finished, and just as you would expect, its bonkers from the very beginning. But Lin wants it to be a little more bonkers, so what does he do? He gets The Rock, and the rest of the crew from the other movies and goes hell for leather.Its a fun romp from beginning to end, and once again, its critic proof, full of fast cars, huge explosions, hot women, silly music, and a safe dragging contest come the end.The Rock is the best thing in this film, looking very angry in every scene, and in some scenes, like he is literally going to explode.Its a lot funnier than the previous movies, and the chemistry between the gang is second to none.Its a load of old cobblers from beginning to end, but what enjoyable cobblers....",Fast Five
18,trashgang,moves away from street racing to a real action flick,7,26 September 2013,"I only though that it could go downhill with the franchise but I can say that this was another great entry. Maybe some will have difficulty with the idea that the street races are a bit left out of this flick and the story sometimes is a bit exaggerated. The gang surrounding Don (Vin Diesel) are almost fighting against the world but the franchise had to fight against other spectacular flicks (the ocean series a bit like this concerning old friends) so they decided to move a bit further with great effects and some nice stunts with cars. In fact this is just a reunion of characters seen in earlier entries but this flick also brought in Dwayne Johnson (Luke Hobbs). Of course you could see from the beginning that he and Don should have a fight man against man and they did. Also from now on you should have seen the earlier flicks to understand who's who and what their specialities are. There are enough flicks in this genre but for me the use of the cars gave it an extra thing to watch. Even this time we do have some goofy situations between the characters that gives it also something to watch. To say it's the best so far I can't really say because this one moves away from street car racing towards a really action flick. And it do has a lot of action. There is a part were things drop down a bit after halfway through the flick but the ending delivers the goods again. And to be honest, Vin isn't the best here. Were he carried part 4 here Dwayne is taking over, Vin has a few clichés to add but still, a great flick. Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 4/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5",Fast Five
19,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Fast Five,9,2 May 2011,"As far as franchise films go, The Fast and Furious series seem to be hitting the ground at top gear, with this installment not showing signs of slowing down, but prepping a new direction for future films to take, shifting gears from a film showcasing hot bodies (not solely just car chassis) and fast nox-enabled cars into the classic heist genre, given that it had that as its underlying premise from the first film, and now with a growing ensemble, are ready to give Ocean's Eleven a run for its money.Rio De Janeiro provides the backdrop in which this installment takes place in (quite a popular location for films recently too), with the chief villain being Reyes (Joaquim de Almedia), a mobster with a businessman front, with his tentacles of vice and influence extending toward every part of the city. Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel), Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) and the former's sister Mia (Jordana Brewster) hide out in the city as fugitives having broken Dom en route to prison at the end of Fast and Furious, and with the kind of money available for the taking to start a family of their own with Mia found to be pregnant, they decide to assemble a team, not to pass up the opportunity of robbing Reyes blind.So in comes a whole host of characters whom we have seen in past films, such as Roman (Tyrese Gibson), Tej (Ludacris), Gisele (Gal Gadot), and even Han (Sung Kang) whom we know what happened to in Tokyo Drift, hence putting the chronology of the films at 1, 2, 4, 5 and 3, which is now sometime in the not so immediate future. Director Justin Lin takes on his 3rd film of the franchise and together with writer Chris Morgan have managed to introduce new elements to surprise audiences and fans up until this installment, keeping with the usual action laden elements, while bringing on new characters into the franchise, this time with Dwayne Johnson coming in as a no nonsense, dogged and persistent FBI operative Hobbs, with an arsenal of technology and attitude to aid him and his team in tracking down Dom and his crew.And of course who cannot wait to see two tough guys in Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson go one on one with each other in a fisticuffs, especially since their time with family friendly films have taken a backseat to put them both firmly back into the action genre. It sets up new rivalry, while keeping the old between Dominic and Brian with the latter always keen to prove who's the better driver. And like most ensemble films, it's make or break given the character's appeal, and I'm glad to note they share this incredibly chemistry this bunch of highly skilled cons who each bring their know-how to the table in trying to pull off mission frickin' insanity, and everyone possessing a mean driver's license to power souped up vehicles.And if it's action you're seeking, it's action you'll get in this film too, putting aside the rather rote and superficial theme of family and trust. There's no lack of races and wheels on the roads although I do note that there's not too much of signature cars to go around this time. Even a would be street race was unceremoniously cut off, although we do get it compensated with a four way race down two traffic lights amongst Roman, Dom, Brian and Han which was more of a fair competition since they were all essentially driving the same model. Then there's the big bang finale that you would have seen in the trailer, with Dom and Brian yanking a bank vault and travelling down the streets of Rio at top speed, in what would be a fittingly noisy last act destroying everything, and I mean everything, along their path, that has to be seen in a cinema to enjoy this guilt trip in sense surround glory. Needless to say I am a fan of the franchise, and am excited about the direction this film would be going even if it would mean limiting the number of cars on the roads, since the film had already shown the potential of that chemistry between the cast and characters, and I'm eagerly anticipating more. From one fanboy and an action junkie to any other, this of course would be recommended fare. Stay tuned while the end credits roll, and you'll be treated to a stinger that reaffirms and teases what's to come in the next film, with no less than two surprise appearances. But no, with the timeline, it'll take a while before Lucas Black will be able to link up with the guys. For an adrenalin pumping high octane entertaining film outing, Fast Five is that opener to a very noisy and crowded summer season to come.",Fast Five
20,Mr-Fusion,I haven't stuck with these movies because the first was about as mediocre as it gets.,5,31 January 2014,"The L.A. mod/racing scene's not my bag, and it was mostly forced drama. But they seem to have reinvented this franchise as a heist/""Expendables"" thing (and I'm a sucker for a good heist flick). They also brought in Dwayne Johnson. Here, take my money. But ""Fast Five"" is a grander/more expensive version of the first movie; forced drama and unrelatable characters. And this is a cast that's surprisingly low on charm. So the casting of both Johnson and Joaquim de Almeida is indeed a charismatic highlight. All in all, this makes for a pretty good mindless entertainment. The action's frenetic, the setpieces absurd. Speedy cars, 'splosions and whatnot. I've got no problem with this movie - I'm just not apart of that target audience. 5/10",Fast Five
21,siderite,"Long, flashy, not much driving",6,12 March 2012,"The movie lasted for a staggering two hours and ten minutes, time in which driving, the foundation of the ""Fast"" franchise, was left in the backseat. The rest, weapons, flashy heist planning and ridiculous intrigue. There had to be a bad guy that was corrupt, rich and utterly evil, there had to be a henchman, just as evil, with a host of faceless drones to command, there had to be a good and honest cop that would chase them, but ultimately respect the gang for who they are, and there had to be chicks. And of course... the gang. ""The best of the best"" almost copied and pasted from Ocean's 3214.That doesn't mean it wasn't a good fun action filled film, just that it was a melange of ideas that were far removed from what I liked in other Fast and Furious films. I love Dwayne Johnson and he played very well the role of the tireless cop, I like Vin Diesel, even if he seems to be on a descendant curve in his career and all the other actors did their jobs well. The thing is: was it worth waiting an hour and a half for a final race that defied logic, physics and probability and yet had little to do with driving? Not really.",Fast Five

23,StevePulaski,The point where the series is basically going into space,4,15 December 2015,"How many film franchises that struggled to merit strong critical reception to match their copious box office earnings can say that, in the eyes of the masses, they got it right the fifth time? The Fast and the Furious franchise is one of the only ones I can think of in that respect, and this is largely because where most franchises would admit they've run out of gas and are having difficultly finding new ground to cover, The Fast and the Furious buckled off and took a detour when it really needed it. When the previous installment, Fast & Furious, failed to excite even die-hard fans, the result for Fast Five was for writer Chris Morgan to continue to embed that grittier style he toyed with in the fourth film to the franchise's formula. The result is a film that plays more like The Italian Job than a Fast and the Furious film, as the emphasis on cars is downgraded considerably to just one street race at the end and the emphasis on the film is a lot of masculine energy in gun fights, fistfights, and a central heist in the storyline.All of this is well and good, and maybe this is what Fast and the Furious began asking for after the fourth film, but for me, this feels like this series went through metamorphosis and became something it was never supposed to be nor foreseen to be. The action setpieces in the film are all undeniably strong in how well they are articulated - especially one in particular which I'll address later - and the level of energy over the course of two hours, the longest runtime a film in the series has boasted thus far, never depletes or falters. However, Fast Five abandons what made the series so likable in the beginning, and turned it into a glossy action film that feels like the highlight reel from an action film. If the first two films in this series were underground street-racing events, this film is the antiseptic showroom floor of a Ferrari dealership.We follow the same characters we have in previous installments, specifically Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker), the cop-turned-street-racer-turned-cop-again-turned-street-racer and his friends Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his sister Mia (Jordana Brewster). In the opening scene of the film, Brian winds up preventing Dom from going back to jail by causing a large pileup involving the bus Dom is being transported on. Miraculously, nobody else on the bus is hurt and only Dom escapes, with the crew fleeing to Rio de Janeiro. It doesn't take long for U.S. Diplomatic Security Service agent Luke Hobbs (Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson) to get hot on Dom's trail, especially when the group hatches a plan to steal $100 million from a corrupt business tycoon named Hernan Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida).In order to pull off such a high-caliber operation, they enlist in some old friends Fast and the Furious fans may recognize. Roman Pierce (Tyrese Gibson), a longtime friend of Brian's is one of them, along with both street-racer and criminal opportunist Han (Sang Kung) and street-race organizer Tej Parker (Ludicrous). All together, the gang assembles like Marvel's Avengers and attempts an international crackdown of epic proportions.Fast Five is the point in the franchise where the series goes to space in order to try and desperately invoke some sort of life and new concepts into their tired formula. The cockamamie qualities of Fast Five might as well have the entire cast beaming up to a different planet or a galaxy far, far away for how incredulous things become in this film. That's not to say the earlier films weren't, but Fast & Furious and Fast Five's jarring tonal shifts work to suck all the fun and juvenile sentiments out of a franchise that boasted them like oscillating rims on a fresh new import.The film isn't a total loss, as some scenes are particularly energetic and provide for some comic absurdity. Consider the scene I alluded to earlier, where Brian and Dom are in separate vehicles both hauling a huge, steel safe across a highway with cops on their tale. Just before they get to the highway, however, they are driving through crowded metropolitan streets, turning corners so sharply and quickly that the safe can barely do anything besides topple over, jackknife, and subsequently shatter the walls and fronts of buildings alongside the road. The repeated collisions between the wall and the safe, which is about half the size of a boxcar on a freight train, doesn't make it come loose nor does it cause any disturbance on part of Brian and Dom as the drivers hurling the safe through the streets. Watching this mesmerizing event is like watching the laws of physics slowly implode on themselves, and it occurred to me that if people started elevating from the ground as if they were being sucked into the heavens in that same particular scene, or at any point throughout this film for that matter, the film's own laws of logic would not be compromised.The original two films offered such an inviting and homey quality to the street racers; where the characters had to avoid the cops in the nick of time or face potentially catastrophic penalties and fines. It was the kind of cheery little thing many people in the audience could presumably relate to. The franchise has now extended itself to the point where street-racing and cars have become secondary in hopes to reach a broader audience; how that isn't viewed by the audience as the franchise selling out is a mystery to me. Fast Five is certainly fast in terms of pacing and editing, and it's also indeed the fifth film in this franchise, but just maybe, besides the multiple ""the""'s and ""and""'s misplaced from this film's title, this franchise is running out of gas and is afraid to really show it.",Fast Five
24,lasttimeisaw,Fast Five,7,15 September 2011,"Frankly speaking, I was unforeseen that this adrenal-driven car-chasing franchise had have such a longevity during this decade since THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS in 2001 (neither am I an automobile zealot). Now here arrives the fifth installment, which surprisingly has unequivocally became the best of the series (quite rare when it comes terms with sequels). One ground rule is that the team behind knows exactly what their audience's hearts want and exaggerates it to a breathtaking effect, e.g. several vintage-model cars (which I am sheerly ignorant of), brawny men bare fist combat (Vin and Dwayne, which makes Paul Walker looks more wooden and sulky), a mission-impossible scheme, a tint of romantics and sexy appeal using its hottie female cast (Gal Gadot, again, the former Miss Israel), and the most essential one, a prolonged vehicle-chase with its eye-popping collateral damage, which is the ace in the hole!Setting against a Rio de Janeiro backdrop, the second time this year after the successful animation RIO among Hollywood A-list blockbusters, director Justin Lin (who was also behind the wheels of the 3rd and 4th film) shrewdly maneuvers an OCEAN ELEVEN mode heist plot to bolster the intensive impulsion of the rapid tempo. Plus the visual effect is high-end enough to coerce me to neglect the implausibility of certain details. My eyes are satisfied while my brain cannot find anything to whine about at all once (during the afterthought, there are plenty of bugs there though), so one sure thing is that FAST FIVE has set a new beacon for the Hollywood mega-budgeted action films, it is a fierce competition which principally hinges on script writers' imagination, I also invent the punchline for the production company: we can make anything look real on screen, as long as there is a mind can reach it!",Fast Five
25,KineticSeoul,"My favorite in the franchise so far, although it almost has nothing to do with street racing",8,2 May 2011,"This really is my favorite in the franchise so far although it really isn't like any of the other films in this franchise in the past. In fact this one has to do with heist involving cars and has almost nothing to do with street racing at all. But that doesn't matter cause this is a entertaining movie with thrills and it's a real adrenaline rush. This really is a film for men with tough guys, suped up cars, insane action sequences, explosions, guns blazing and hot girls and etc. This movie is a definition of a entertaining popcorn flick. The plot is stupid but it's still sure fun to watch when the set pieces and action sequences are done in a very entertaining manner although very over the top. Physics don't apply in this movie at all and the crazy stuff happening on screen doesn't make any sense sometimes but that doesn't matter cause overall this is a stupid entertaining flick. Yeah it has a lot of elements guys like to see, but a lot of girls enjoyed this movie as well. The adrenaline runs out sometimes since the action and the stuff going on gets a bit tiresome after a while though. Most of the team members in the heist played the character off alright. And surprisingly The Rock(Dwayne Johnson) was pretty good in this playing the badass macho cop. This movie also has few scenes that are memorable that actually stands out, one of them is the scene where Vin Diesel and The Rock duke it out in a melee hand to hand fighting.8/10",Fast Five
26,Hellmant,'FAST FIVE' gets 3.5 out of 5.,7,30 April 2011,"'FAST FIVE': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five) I was never a big fan of the original 'THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS' and thought it was severely over-hyped. With each sequel though I think the franchise has gotten better (although I never saw the third chapter: 'TOKYO DRIFT'). This one (for the first time) brings together key cast members from all of the other films including Vin Diesel (who sat out the second film and only did a cameo in the third), Paul Walker (who was absent from the third film), Jordana Brewster (who missed the second and third films) as well as Tyrese Gibson, Ludicrous, Matt Schulze, Sung Kang, Cal Gadot and Tego Calderon (who all co-starred in one or two of the other films). It also adds Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson to the cast and fans finally get to see a long anticipated fight scene between he and Vin Diesel. The film is directed by Justin Lin (who also directed the last two films) and written by Chris Morgan (who wrote the last two films as well). It all adds up to a pretty entertaining action film that should definitely please most fans of the genre as well as fans of the franchise.The film opens directly where the last one left off with former FBI agent turned outlaw Brian O'Conner (Walker) and girlfriend Mia (Brewster) breaking Mia's brother and Brian's buddy and partner in crime Dominic Toretto (Diesel) out of prison, by attacking the prison bus he's on. They then flee to Brazil and due to a botched car heist (where DEA agents are murdered) they're moved to the top of America's most wanted list. The baddest federal agent around, Lucas Hobbs (Johnson), is then put on assignment to track them down. O'Conner and Toretto then decide to pull one last big job on the crooked businessman, Hernan Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida), who framed them by stealing $100 million of his laundered money. They bring in a team of former associates to help them pull off the heist.The movie is really predictable and the story and character development pretty routine but the action scenes are amazing. The film does drag a little in the middle, during the overlong heist setup part of the film but for the most part it's really fast paced and thrilling. The stunts are some of the best ever performed (probably) and the amount of sheer destruction in the film is astonishing. There are several scenes that seriously push the realm of logic and reality but it's all in good senseless fun. The Rock makes a cool addition to the series and the fight scene between him and Diesel doesn't disappoint. The film is most likely everything you think it's going to be and it delivers exactly what it promises. In that sense it's definitely a success and in my opinion at least a little better than all the others in the franchise (just adding the Rock makes it that much better).Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2_pFXcDSfo",Fast Five

There was enough testosterone in Fast Five for me to get married and divorced three times, due to dozens of affairsall with women.2. To even use the phrase ""Leave Your Brain at the Door"" to describe this movie is like describing Phoenix, AZ as hot.3. They gave The Rock a goatee so you can tell the difference between him and the other meathead.4. The group-heist scheme was so juvenile, even Danny Ocean would call them amateurs.5. Of course, they left it open for a sequel, which, no doubt, should be called The Fastisix.6. Pregnant women that leap from two stories and crash through the roof of a structure should at very least get a spot on the next Planned Parenthood promotional video.7. What comes after the following series of battles? King Kong Vs. Godzilla; Freddy Vs. Jason; Alien Vs. Predator; Pacino Vs. De Niro..uh, Dwayne Vs. Diesel? 8. Not everyone likes sequels being made. But, I'm sure as hell Paul Walker does.9. The movie's not going to be considered for Best Picture anyways, so I hope they fired whoever made the decision to delete the scenes that the series is known for – racing cars to win other fast cars.10. Thankfully, EBay sells everything, including an entire, full-size vault, exactly like the one you plan on robbing. Heck, in one click, you can get it delivered in hours. To Rio, no less.11. The movie opened in April 2011 to $86 million which spun Hollywood Honcho's heads until summer began. Then their heads were just shaking.12. Expecting Fast Five to be realistic is like believing there really are prehistoric piranhas in Lake Havasu, AZ.13. Calling this predictable is as predictable as calling it predictable.14. Incredibly, there wasn't a writer's strike during the production.15. Sooothey steal four cop cars, and their first instinct is to race them in plain view?16. Also, now that four cop cars are now missing, much to the bottomless pit of luck to our antiheroes, the police never bothered to GPS the cars, much less write a theft report.17. Joker burned money to make a point. These guys did it because they couldn't come up with one original idea.18. These guys have more lives than Jason Voorhees and yethave only about half as many sequels.19. You could mute this movie and still know what's going on.20. Cops turn bad so frequently in this series, they should turn to politics next.21. The cartoonish finale is so ""Yeah, Right"" that it makes Wile E. Coyote's schemes plausible.22. Why is it in heist movies, it's always their last gig? Their last take? Their last job? Their last everythinguntil the next installment?23. What is Monica Geller doing in Rio robbing crooked police?24. UFC called and asked Vinnie and Rockie how they can make their fights now not look so school-yard-brawl'ish.25. When you find out you're gonna be a dad, asking the nearest tough guy his fondest memories of his own dad is like Ted Striker asking the guy next to him to pinch him to see if he was dreaming.26. Wow...Vinnie's actually smarter than he looks. He took an additional role as Producer.27. With everything wronghow on Earth was this just simply entertaining and probably the best of the series? (Yes, indubitably, I actually enjoyed this mindless flick.)",Fast Five
29,cherold,Finally broke down and watched one of these things,5,25 May 2021,"I never had any interest in the Fast and the Furious movies, which I'd never even heard of until it became the nickname for a political scandal. It sounded like something with a bunch of people racing cars and maybe committing or solving crimes or something. I don't care about speedy cars, I'm not into racing videogames, I'm definitely not the target audience.Recently I saw a trailer for a new one though, and I thought, this looks kind of fun. But since that movie got bad reviews I decided I would learn which was the best in the series and watch that.The movie was pretty much what I expected, cars and guns and muscly guys. It's stupid from the first brief action scene, which should have killed about 30 people but somehow doesn't. Then there's some unlikely plot, a bunch of driving and shooting, predictable twists, more shooting, a bunch of running.As action movies go, this seems vastly familiar to both the martial arts films of stars like Jet Li and Jackie Chan and the special effects driven superhero genre, and I don't get the appeal at all. But listen, it's not trying to entertain me, it's trying to entertain cars & muscly guys freaks, and if this sounds like something you'd like you'll probably like it.",Fast Five
30,FeastMode,combine it all,8,25 June 2019,"Awesome movie. Entertaining to the max. Good continuation of the story with lots of good connections to the past ones. Was awesome to see characters from all 4 previous movies meet for the first time. Amazing action of all sorts, racing, shooting, fighting, chasing. So many crazy scenes and omg moments.

31,Robert_duder,Action movie for the ages,9,27 April 2019,"I have been wondering for a long time why we don't see the action films we used to. I miss the 80's and 90's and Stallone, Schwarzenegger, Willis and so on. Imagine my surprise when I found that action genre right here. Fast and Furious rebooted this franchise and turned it into a heist/action/racing genre hybrid that is unbeatable at the box office. It's also interesting that so far every other of these films is great and every other of these films is okay. The Fast and The Furious was great, 2 Fast was okay, Tokyo Drift was great, Fast and Furious was okay and now we have Fast 5. Adding Dwayne Johnson to anything nowadays seems to make it a surefire hit and it's easy to see why. This guy has unbelievable charisma on screen and he's quite simply bad ass. You place him next to and against Vin Diesel and action fans will drool. Add into that, some of the craziest, most incredible stunt and action scenes and you've got one of the most rip roaringly entertaining films I've ever seen. I see some reviews that talk about realism and plot holes (characters without any damage after suffering fights etc.) . but this genre of action is one that suspends belief if the story and performances are good enough and they are!! Fast 5 will not make you ponder life or love but it will leave you breathless and completely entertained. Jaw dropping scenes literally because I found myself watching with my mouth open during some of the more intense scenes. The train heist will forever be one of my favorite action sequences. An amazing piece of work. 9/10",Fast Five
32,ThomasDrufke,New Breed of Fast & Furious,9,12 April 2017,"Ah, the film that kicked off the new breed of Fast & Furious films, Fast Five. The film that gathered all of the fan favorite characters from previous films into one gigantic ensemble. Throw in Dwayne The Rock Johnson and you have yourself what may be the best the franchise will ever be.I've had a hard time ordering which F&F film is actually the best/my favorite. 5,6, and 7 all are tremendous. They know exactly what type of film they are and what type of film they're not. Perhaps Fast Five takes the cake for being the first to truly embrace the ridiculousness of the franchise. Even with the previous film, there was a little bit of tone deaf at times with the writing. However, Fast Five takes the series to a whole new level in terms of tone, characters, and even genre.In many ways, this was a soft reboot for the series. Essentially, the characters become superhuman with qualities they just didn't have before. As far as I'm concerned, Tej was never a tech genius, Mia was never able to hack into police scanners, and Roman was never scared of anything. All of those were added in to service the story they wanted to tell in Fast Five. You know what? That's completely fine by me. A soft reboot was exactly what these films needed. If that was what we needed to do to have the characters pull off an insane heist and have a blast doing it? I'm all in.The Rock (aka franchise Viagra) adds another layer to the film as well. Gone are the days where Dom & Brian are going after one another. Now, you have 260 pounds of pure muscle going after the entire crew, and boy is it worth it. Not only is it mind-blowingly entertaining to watch Diesel and Johnson fight, Johnson actually brings a lot to the role of Hobbs. These movies have always been keen on establishing an inner code/morals for each character, and Hobbs' code works well alongside and against Dom's. Apparently, the role was originally going to be Tommy Lee Jones, but I can't imagine anyone better than The Rock to play him.Much like the previous film, Fast Five does a great job of reestablishing past relationships, developing new ones, and doubling down on the action. This series is half about family and half about how insane each stunt and action sequence can be. By this point, they nearly abandoned the street racing part for the heist angle, and it works. Heck, even the one time they do have a ""race"", it's entirely off-screen. Fast Five is the epitome of what the series has become and I'm not sure a film has matched the incredible pacing and contagious chemistry between the ensemble.+Enter, The Rock+Dom vs Hobbs+Doubles down on emotion & action+Soft reboot serves the series well-Even if some of the character changes don't make much sense9.5/10",Fast Five
33,MLDinTN,"no longer a car movie, this is a slick heist flick",7,9 April 2012,"This sequel has basically moved away from the core of the first film which was about fast cars and slick driving into a pure seemingly impossible heist film. And I do have to say the way they pull of the whole vault theft was pretty good.The plot is Dom, Brain, and Mia are living in Rio de Janerio and on the run. It starts out with a pretty good action of them along with some other bad guys stealing cars out of a moving train. I don't think I believe that's possible, but it was still cool to watch. Any ways these guys there are working with work for the drug lord criminal of all of Rio, Reyes. They take this car that Reyes wanted and it turns out a chip was hidden in it that tells the locations of where Reyes hides his money.Mean while, the Rock plays a US agent hunting them down in Brazil. Dom decides to pull of the heists of all heist and sends for help, where we get some other characters from previous films. So, then we get to see if the plan works.BTW, the whole part of 2 cars pulling a very heavy fault down the street and racing was very silly. No way that is possible, but it was still entertaining.FINAL VERDICT: I like impossible heist movies, so I give it a positive recommendation.",Fast Five
34,g-bodyl,By Far the Franchise's Best!,10,4 February 2013,"The Fast and the Furious franchise is not the best franchise out there but the first four films were just fun, over-the-top movies that doesn't need a plot. I didn't know that there could be any masterpieces in this series, then Fast Five came along. What we got here is more fun, absurd action, impossible stunts, returning characters from past films, and yes, emotion.Justin Lin's film takes place right after Fast & Furious ended, with Brian and Mia rescuing Dom Toretto from life imprisonment. After that, they travel to Rio de Janeiro where they plan to lay low. But they soon figure to do one last deal before they retire. They bring in old friends to help them do the cash grab of a lifetime. But, Luke Hobbs, a beefed-up cop on a mission is the one who plans on bringing the gang down.Vin Diesel and Paul Walker have great chemistry in this film. Woking together for three films will do this to actors. I loved that many of the old faces such as Tyrese Gibson, Sung Kang, Ludicrous, and Matt Schulze have returned. Jordana Brewster is still looking good after all these years.Overall, this is one heck of a ride. What makes this film work is that instead of a racing cars film, we have a heist film. This follows in the footsteps of the Ocean's trilogy and it works. I loved all these stunts. They get better as each movie progresses. I don't know how they did this, but I really liked that preposterous scene where Vin and Paul jumped out of a car while it drives off a cliff. That was just incredible. This is definitely the best in the series and I'm excited for the sixth installment. I rate this film 10/10.",Fast Five

In order to properly flee from the authorities, Brian & Dom call some old friends & unlikely allies to help pull off an elaborate robbery. The only problem is that relentless federal agent, Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) stands in their way of freedom. You know what you're gonna get with these movies! I'm an adult, but I'm not afraid to say that I enjoy these movies. What else can you possibly want as far as popcorn entertainment goes? After the mediocre, Fast % Furious: Tokyo Drift, this series was in need of a reboot of sorts. The fourth installment (Fast & Furious) was very entertaining and things got back on track in a big way. Fast Five transcends it's predecessor quite easily. It's bigger, badder, and a lot of fun. There are quite a few action scenes that stand out, especially the last 20/30 minutes. I also appreciated the emotion in this one. Brian & Mia are a believable couple that are easy to sympathize with (Making Mia pregnant was a nice touch) Even Vince was brought back into the fold. A lot of effort was obviously put into this movie and I appreciated it. The performances are a hoot. Vin Diesel has never been a great actor, but his presence is undeniable. He makes a perfect anti-hero and his chemistry with Paul Walker was excellent as always. Paul Walker improved immensely since the first movie. He gives a mature performance that I enjoyed very much. Jordana Brewster is solid as the love interest. Dwayne Johnson completely stole the show in my eyes! His gruff character was a blast to watch and I relished every second he was on-screen. This guy oozes with charisma. Tyrese Gibson is a bit of a loudmouth that is alternately annoying and amusing! Ludicrous was tolerable at best. The villains are a bit underdeveloped, but the movie is so entertaining that I didn't really care. I wouldn't call myself a fan-boy of these movies, but I've enjoyed every movie in this series except for the third one. This one is filled with great action, solid storytelling, lots of cool characters, what more do you want?! I haven't seen Fast Six so I'm gonna call this the best movie in the series. Note! Make sure you stay for the end credits! There is a huge twist8.5/10",Fast Five

40,The-Sarkologist,The Formula is Set,7,10 December 2016,"Well, I have now finished watching number five in what appears to be turning into a never ending series (though how it is going to continue now that Paul Walker has passed on, ironically due to a motor vehicle accident, of which the movie warns at the end not to do due to them being performed by professional stuntmen in a controlled environment, is yet to be seen). Actually, this film is probably the one that has moved to set the standard of how the next two movies were to evolve. First of all you have Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson now making an entrance, particularly since Brian O'Conner has decided to throw his hat in with the bad guys and has once again left the FBI. Mind you, with the friendship that he has built with Torretto over the series it is not surprising that he has once again become a crook.Anyway, O'Conner and his girlfriend, once again wanted by the authorities in the United States (for breaking Toretto out of goal no less), have surfaced in Brazil where they are offered a job to attempt to steal some cars off of a train. Toretto, who has disappeared, returns to assist in the heist, however decides that instead to returning the car to the drug lord of Rio, decides to take it for himself. In all of the confusion two DEA agents are killed, which brings Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) to Rio in an attempt to capture them. Of course, despite the fact that Toretto and O'Conner are basically small time crooks, they are still the heroes of the film, so what we have is a three way tussle where they have unfortunately been caught in the middle.As I have mentioned, this film has taken a different course to the previous films in the series, and while I am yet to watch the next two, I suspect that they are going to start to follow this format. First of all we have our two main characters, who happen to live in the shadow world but aren't necessarily bad guys – small time crooks would probably be the best way to describe them. Not Robin Hood characters – they don't rob from the rich to give to the poor, they rob from the crooks to give to themselves. Actually, if it wasn't for the fact that they landed up on the wrong side of the Brazilian drug lord they probably would have left him, and his riches, alone.This is the thing with the film – they upset the drug lord who then decides to attempt to shut them down, and despite the fact that he has pretty much all of the security apparatus of Rio on his side, he still isn't able to stop a handful of determined thugs from taking down his empire and scooting off with his money. Mind you, this is Hollywood, so I probably wouldn't expect to be able to get away with this in real life, though I probably wouldn't be surprised if such people did have their claws into the political and security apparatus of the state. Sure, they might have little influence over the American government, but corruption seems to happen in another, more legal, way there through the revolving door system of political appointments, campaign financing, and K-Street lobbyists. However the suggestion is that in the countries south of the border it is the drug money that controls the government and the security forces, and the gangs are armed much better than the police.Anyway, this addition to the franchise seems to have moved away from car racing and more towards the action. Sure, they have the occasional visit to an illegal drag racing circuit, but the focus, despite the name, is no longer street racing and now more on the action. Mind you, of the five films that have been released up to now, three of them have involved drug lords, one of them purely about racing, and of course there was the first one. It also seems as if Vin Diesel is the star of the series, and even though Paul Walker also plays a major role, he still seems to play second fiddle (though I have to admit that when he died, I hadn't even heard of him).",Fast Five

Most of the regular cast is back. Enter Dwayne Johnson, as Hobbs. Gal Gadot - who made her appearance in 'Fast & Furious' - is back as well; this time as part of Dom's team. Vince is also back, after a 3-film absence. Wow, the male actors were like a muscle exhibition!The opening bus crash scene sent warning signs to my brain, telling me the action was going to be overdone and unrealistic. Fortunately, this was not the case. Instead, the action sequences were very well choreographed and incredible. The vault scene, especially, is nothing short of spectacular. It was awesome seeing the vault causing so much chaos and mayhem. Unlike anything I've ever seen! The action in general - even the fighting scenes - were fast-paced and no holds barred.The amazing cars of the previous films are no longer the main attraction. The car races are merely here to make up time and doesn't really play a role anymore. 'Fast Five' is a heist film, and more hi-tech than its predecessors.

45,tomgillespie2002,A satisfying way to spend two hours with your brain on auto pilot,6,9 February 2015,"Usually, the fifth instalment of a long-running franchise is a re- hash of what made the original so popular, becoming increasingly tiresome in the process. 2009's fourth entry, Fast & Furious, which saw the core cast members return from a two film hiatus, was surprisingly fun, being less about flashy cars, nameless gyrators and the underground world of street racing, and focused more on the 'family' of criminals to whom the plot was centred around. Returning director Justin Lin, who has been on board since 2006's Tokyo Drift, continues this idea and makes a movie more exciting and action- packed than the one's that came before.After rescuing their friend Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) from a lengthy jail term, Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) and his girlfriend Mia (Jordana Brewster) flee to Rio de Janeiro to evade capture. Whilst they await the arrival of Dom, they pull a job with old acquaintance Vince (Matt Schulze), from the first movie, capturing a set of cars seized by the D.E.A. on their way, by train, to the U.S. When they discover that two of their crew are only interested in one car, Dom - who arrives mid-heist - gets Mia to steal it herself and the rest barely escape with their lives. The car turns out to be the property of drug lord Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida), and contains a microchip detailing the whereabouts of his $100 million fortune.In an attempt to open the franchise up to a wider audience, Fast Five sees the series change from underground street racing and petty criminality to full-on fisticuff action, bagging a huge ensemble to support it's aspirations to be a heist movie. And it works. This is still stuff of the cheesiest variety, ignoring the laws of physics and asking us to suspend our beliefs far too often, but the idea of these criminals - who evolve into Robin Hood-types - who help each other like a family is nice. Lin brings back familiar faces Roman (Tyrese Gibson), Tej (Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges), Han (Sung Kang), and Gisele (Gal Gadot), but it's a newcomer that steals the show.As Hobbs, the enormous, baby-oiled D.S.S. agent assigned to capture Dom and his crew, Dwayne Johnson proves to be a great addition. With his ridiculous size, he's a credible threat to the likes of Dom, and their scenes together, including one inevitable smack-down, are laced with testosterone and a bit of humour, two things that Johnson does remarkably well. The main set-piece involves two cars dragging a stolen safe through the city streets, leaving a wave of destruction in their path. It's a gleefully ridiculous climax, and Lin proves himself wise by using minimal CGI. It doesn't break any boundaries or offer anything new to the genre, but it's a satisfying way to spend two hours with your brain on auto pilot mode.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",Fast Five

What makes this film standout, is the group of characters blending from the previous films.They were given an equal amount of screen time and as we seein the end it works out. Also in comparison to Fast & Furious, Fast Five doesn't take itself overly serious and feels like a funner thrill ride from the start to end. The stunts and overall visuals are bigger and better.Dwayne Johnson's character steals his scenes and makes the film instantly better. The fight scene between him and Vin Diesel was worth the hype. Also including the franchises' best chase scene we see in the finale, involving the bank's fault with both Vin and Paul Walker chasing away from the villains, with the help of the other team members.For that final scene alone, is what makes the film worth it and better than the previous four.

49,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"Scale, size and speed all cranked up to the benefit of ""Fast Five""",7,4 April 2017,"The acceleration period of the ""Fast & Furious"" franchise is officially over. Now it's all pure speed. ""Fast Five"" pretty much blows the roof off of all previously held notions of what these movies are and could be. The action, the stunts, the cast — everything is bigger. With director Justin Lin and writer Chris Morgan returning from ""Fast & Furious,"" the creative sensibilities are all the same, so clearly the $40 million in additional budget had a big role to play in the finished product.Audiences handsomely rewarded ""Fast & Furious"" at the box office; in ""Fast Five,"" they reap the benefits. Never before have so many cars, trucks and trains been pulverized into scrap metal on the big screen. The stunts are simply huge. (I'd say grandiose, but this is the ""Fast & Furious"" franchises after all.) Morgan and Lin get the green light to do whatever they can imagine. Even if what they dream up doesn't make sense, it's fun to watch.Other than financial freedom, Morgan in particular has a lot more freedom of story. The unusual circumstances of the franchise's beginnings (i.e. Vin Diesel turning down the second film) created a recovery period of sorts. ""Fast & Furious"" had to bring Diesel's Dominic Toretto and Paul Walker's Brian O'Conner back together and reenergize fans of the 2001 original; ""Fast Five"" had a blank canvas. The usual tropes of these movies have been minimized and some passed over completely. It's a much looser and more fun movie.Surprisingly, the entire movie takes place in Rio de Janeiro. O'Conner and Mia (Jordana Brewster) have fled there after breaking Dom out of federal custody by flipping a bus of prisoners on a desert highway. That's the film's quick open. Dom is in Rio as well, and they all meet back up to pull off a job that will keep them on their feet. Only the job (boosting cars off a moving train) doesn't go quite as planned, and they have irked another powerful drug lord named Reyes, who ""owns"" Rio. They've also caught the attention of the FBI, who's sent its best man-hunter, Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) to bring them in. Morgan can't quite free these movies of the criminal good guys vs. law officer bad guys dynamic. On the plus side, at least it's no longer about whether or not O'Conner is going to do his job or throw it all away to help Toretto and co. He's firmly on their team now. On the other hand, you can imagine that the same war of conscience might befall Johnson's Hobbs and the woman he's picked as his sidekick, Elena (Elsa Pataky).""Fast Five"" also brings back some old faces: ""2 Fast 2 Furious"" stars Tyrese as Roman Pierce and Ludicrous as Tej, as well as Matt Schulze, who played Vince in the original ""The Fast and the Furious."" Add Sung Kang as Han from ""Tokyo Drift,"" and Gal Gadot, Tego Calderon and Don Omar from the last movie and you have a massive ensemble with which to play-act ""Ocean's Eleven."" That's essentially the model for this movie; all the characters have special talents and they're going to pull off a heist to take down the biggest boss-man in Rio. The characters also fit certain stereotyped roles, but that figures.Pretty much all criticisms of the plot and story mechanics become meaningless once Dom and O'Conner start speeding through the streets of Rio towing a gigantic safe in grand finale. The physics are questionable, but the movie stands out on the ingenuity of this action sequence alone, one that serves as an apt metaphor for this film series' reckless, bulldozing, couldn't-give-a-damn attitude. The ""Fast and Furious"" movies continue to ride comfortably in the seat of mediocrity, but they get to do it on the grandest stage yet in ""Fast Five,"" and that ratcheted-up entertainment factor helps sway this movie into more favorable territory.~Steven CThanks for reading!

50,Vartiainen,The pinnacle of its franchise,8,17 May 2020,"I think it's safe to say that it's Fast Five where The Fast and the Furious saga finally found its groove. It managed to keep all that was good about the franchise beforehand and combine it with the high stakes adrenaline rush of an international caper spy genre.The returning goodness still culminates in Paul Walker and Vin Diesel playing Brian O'Conner and Dominic Toretto, two street racing experts who are set to face the world no matter what it throws at them. Plus, you know, fast cars, hot women, killer soundtrack. All that good stuff. Plus Jordana Brewster as Mia Toretto. What's not to like.But then the new good stuff. First of all, Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson as a hardened federal agent going after Brian and Dom. Fantastic casting that allows you just that hint of incredulity. Because, you know, The Rock is larger than life.But this film also sees the return of many side characters from previous films. Gal Gadot as Gisele, Sung Kang as Han, Tyrese Gibson as Roman, and so on. All beloved characters, brought together at last to pull off a heist. Which was a great genre for this franchise to evolve into.If I had to gripe about something, I'd say the villain is really forgettable. And I'm not talking about Johnson's character. I'm talking about the mob boss, the target of the heist. Can't even remember his name. Still, he's not the most important part of the movie.

But when I saw trailer to this, I knew it was a film not to be missed, and I was right.Dominic(Vin Diesel), Brian(Paul Walker), and Mia(Jordana Brewster) hatch a plan for the perfect heist, they put together a team, and map out the plan, but it gets short sided when a enforcement agent(Dwayne The Rock Johnson) is hot on there trail, and he and his team will stop at nothing till they bring down Dominic and his team down. but will they? In all these movies the shiny cars become a character themselves. The action is ten times intense then ever, it has awesome chase scenes. Not to mention an awesome confrontation between Vin Diesel and Dwayne The Rock Johnson, watching those two muscle bound action stars slug it out on film, is like a dream come true. like I said you'll get what you paid for.",Fast Five
53,generationofswine,I've written this review before,1,10 June 2013,"OK, OK, I'll be honest, I haven't seen this one, but what does that matter? I saw the ""Fast & the Furious,"" & then, thanks to friends I saw ""2 Fast, 2 Furious"" & outside of the cast change, I thought I was watching the same movie.You know, the same movie.The one with Nick Cage ""Gone in 60 Seconds."" No, I'm joking, ""Gone in 60 Seconds"" was a lot better.I think I missed a few, the next one I saw was ""Tokyo Drift."" It was really ""The Fast & the Furious,"" only in Japan, with a slightly different cast.Any way you look at it, if you have seen one you have honestly seen them all. And if you have an IQ above 80, you probably hate them as much as I do.So just re-watch the first one five times. You won't know the difference.",Fast Five
54,freemantle_uk,"The action is awesome, but who cares about the plot?",7,8 April 2012,"Back in 2001 The Fast and the Furious was released in cinema and was a hit; but who would have thought this series would have lasted for five films, with at least two more on the way. Even more surprising is that the fifth film of the series is considered the best of the series.Fast Five starts where Fast & Furious left off, with Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) and Mia Toretto (Jordana Brewster) breaking Dominic (Vin Diesel) out of a prison and the three flee to Rio de Janeiro. Running low on cash Brian and Mia agree to do rob cars from the DEA on a train but end up crossing crime lord Hernan Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida) who controls the Favelas of the city. With information about Reyes' operation, the trio form a team to make on of the most audacious robberies imaginable. But on their trial is Luke Hobbs (Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson), a Diplomatic Security Service agent sent by the FBI to bring Brian and Dominic back to America.Because of the success of the previous three films, Justin Lin has become a in demand director, being linked to The Wolverine and reboot of The Terminator and Highlander. He certainly shows he is a good action director, delivering solid action sequences like the early train robbery, the shootout and chase in the Favelas and the car chase in the city. They are crisp, well edited, fun and have physicality because of use of practical effects and stunt work. They were easily the best parts of the film, alone with Johnson's show stealing performance. He had the best lines and he has the charisma and physique to be threat. He was funny and this is the type of film Johnson should be doing instead of the family comedies he has been doing. The film needed more of him.Acting has never been a strong point of the series and fans want to see action sequences and car races/chases. Diesel is a decent action lead, he is certainly convincing during action scenes against Johnson. Brewster, Walker and Sung Kang are okay if a little flat. Tyresse Gibson is still annoying but is not quite the idiot he was in 2 Fast 2 Furious. Just do not expect any acting master classes. Though de Almeida is oily as ever.Plot and writing are fairly thin throughout. Fast Five is a heist film where they want to rob a big bad gangster whilst trying to avoid getting arrest themselves. The big twist is that they use muscle cars for the robbery. Originally Fast Five started life as a sequel to the remake of The Italian Job but obviously evolved into a Fast and Furious sequel. It is your typical heist film, a crew is assembled, they make their preparations and follow the mark or scan locations, etc. But there are some silly moments, from making out the heroes are Robin Hood figures but never really expand on it and show they want the money for themselves and not giving it to the poor. There are moments showing that the characters to be a bit stupid, such as racing in police cars when they were meant to be uncover (and coming to that shouldn't police cars be very difficult to rob) and when they steal the safe of money it causes millions of dollars of damage and possibly would have killed about a dozen people. A more serious criticism is considering the material the running time Fast Five is too long for what it is, compared to say X-Men: First Class which needed the same running time or Rise of the Planet of the Apes which fitted in more in less. A running time of about 1 hour 45 minutes would have been more fitting. There also the typical leery nature of filming women focusing on their breasts and butts, there was even a plot point based on this. This is just fan services for a young male crowd. Finally the humour does fall flat and the film should have been played a bit more straight.There are fun moments, certainly good action films and I do wish more films used practical effects these days. The plot is a little silly at times, it is over the top, but there are plenty of films from the 80s like that. It is not a great film but it is easy viewing.",Fast Five
55,PWNYCNY,Let us pay homage to all the automobiles that were sacrificed in the making of this movie.,10,4 May 2011,"One thing about this movie becomes immediately apparent: its fixation on the automobile. This is a movie that goes through automobiles like a glutton consumes food. The wreckage and carnage is nonstop. This movie is a junkyard dealer's dream. This movie may set a record for the most automobiles demolished in one movie. In this movie, automobiles are crashed, smashed, dismantled, reassembled, assessed, analyzed,and discussed. In this movie, automobiles are more than just props, they are characters too who are sacrificed to achieve a greater good, which is to tell a story. When an automobile blows up one can almost imagine that poor hunk of metal grimacing in its final death throes, as the humans fight on. Almost all the action centers around automobiles, flashy automobiles, as well as their cousins, the armored cars, trucks, and vans. In this movie, if an object has an engine and wheels it is vulnerable to destruction by fire, blunt force or explosion, or a combination of all three. In this movie automobiles are put through their paces. This movie shows that when an automobile traveling at an extremely high speed makes contact with some other heavy object, the results can be spectacular, and in this movie it is proved time and time again. All this being the case, this has to be one of the best action movies made in a long time. The movie brings together all the elements need to produce a credible, entertaining product. The story is innovative and original; the acting is strong; and the cinematography, including special effects, is incredible. The good guys are really good and the bad guys are really bad. Jordana Brewster is beautiful as are all the female cast, but Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson have a screen presence which carries this movie. They are an entertainment team that is unmatchable. Bringing these two superb and charismatic performers together in one movie works brilliantly. The story moves forward relentlessly, each scene crammed with action. Also, this movie contains spectacular panoramic vistas of Rio de Janeiro and the music is snappy, as is the dialog. There is quarreling, fighting, friendship, teamwork, love, loyalty, and betrayal. Dwyane Johnson is the new Arnold Schwarzenegger, except that Mr. Johnson is better. His screen presence is incredible. In addition, he can act! Congratulations to everyone involved in making this movie. It is a masterpiece. This movie is a much-watch for any action movie aficionados and for movie buffs in general consistent with the movies PG-13 rating.",Fast Five
56,alindsay-al,A Good Fun Heist Film,7,27 July 2019,"With Hobbs & Shaw coming up, I thought I would go back and watch the first Fast and Furious film where Luke Hobbs is a main character Fast Five and out of all the Fast and Furious films I have watched so far this is slightly my favourite. The premise of the film sees the gang led by Dominic Torretto have to complete a huge heist while being hunted by special agent Luke Hobbs. Vin Diesel has become known for this franchise and he is entertaining to watch in the role of Dom but I don't think anybody has ever said Vin Diesel is a great actor and he is very one dimensional in this film which to be honest I expected. The late Paul Walker is in this film and he is similar to Diesel, he fits the role he needs to fit well but his character doesn't really stand out at all and there is very little to grasp onto in term of interest. As mentioned this was the first time Dwayne Johnson played the character of Luke Hobbs and he is great here, he is the one character with real development in the film and you really see his character go through plenty in this film. The rest of the crew are fun to be with, Tyrese Gibson and Ludacris have great chemistry and really bring some fun to the film and it is nice to see a pre Wonder Woman Gal Gadot do a decent job in the film. The story is fun and never really stops moving, I really enjoy the heist idea and feel it really helped keep this film fun and interesting with some good twists and turns. However, because of this frantic pacing there isn't much time for the important dramatic moments in the film which means I wasn't as invested in the action scenes as I didn't care enough about the characters. The script was good, the drama works in the film when it is used and the humour provides the necessary laughs without making this film a comedy. The style of these films are usually impressive, this film has great action scenes but they aren't insane in this one which in my opinion makes it more entertaining to watch as it is slightly plausible. Overall this is a highly entertaining action film that if you are a fan of this franchise is a worthy addition.",Fast Five
57,estebangonzalez10,The best of the Five,7,17 May 2011,"¨I suggest you make peace with whatever demons you have left cause come tomorrow, I will find you.¨ The Fast and the Furious franchise is back with its fifth installment, Fast Five, and I must say this is probably the best one of the series. Almost all the characters from the previous films are back and director Justin Lin has managed to bring the franchise back to life. I thought Tokyo Drift would definitely bury the series without Vin Diesel or Paul Walker, but then they managed to bring all the main characters back, mix them together, and now it seems we will have plenty more fast cars coming our way. The screenplay was written by Chris Morgan, who also wrote the third and fourth ones, and the story works really well although that isn't the reason why we go see these movies. There are probably better actors, better scripts, and more believable heist thrillers than this one, but we still go see these movies for the cars and the great action sequences. The situations these guys go through is unbelievable, we know that the way these characters drive they should all have died in the first Fast and Furious, but we know this is just a fun and entertaining franchise and we try to make peace with the screenplay as best we can because it is just fun to see these guys go at it. It's fun to see them drive cars off a running train, or speed by busy streets without crashing into each other while at the same time avoiding all sorts of bullets and explosions. Fast Five might be the most unbelievable and improbable film of the franchise, but it is still the best one.The film picks up right where the fourth one left us, Brian (Paul Walker) and Mia (Jordana Brewster) are breaking Dominic (Vin Diesel) out of custody while he is being transported to jail. They successfully manage to free him, and all three of them become fugitives. They are forced to continually be on the run and end up in Rio de Janeiro with very little money left on them. In Rio they stay with Dom's longtime friend from the first film, Vince (Matt Schulze), who is now living in the favelas with his girlfriend and baby boy Nico. Vince tells Brian he has a job for them and since they are short on cash they have to accept. Unfortunately something goes wrong in the job and the guys make a new enemy: Hernan Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida), a corrupt businessman who owns the entire police force and gangsters in Rio. Now Dom and Brian have all the gangsters, the Brazilian police, and special Federal Agent Luke Hobbs (Dwayne ¨The Rock¨ Johnson) along with his elite team after them in beautiful Rio. Dom and Brian decide to pull off one last job in order to teach Hernan a lesson, but in order to do so they will need to assemble an elite team. That is where the rest of the crew from previous films come in. First we have Tej (Ludicrous) and Roman (Tyrese Gibson) from the first sequel, then there's Han Lue (Sung Jang) from the Tokyo Drift film, and finally Gisele (Gal Gadot), Tego (Tego Calderon), and Rico Santos (Don Omar) are back from the latest installment. Together they hope to pull off one of the biggest heists of their lives worth 100 million dollars, but being able to pull it off doesn't seem that easy.Fast Five delivers what it promises and even more. There are a lot of action sequences and they are shot extremely well. The cars move really fast, but that isn't all Fast Five has going for it. The addition of The Rock to the story sets up an interesting fight scene between him and Dominic. The Rock helped boost the series even more and brought something fresh to the franchise. There is also the plus that the film took place in Rio de Janeiro and the scenery there is just so beautiful. There is a great chase scene that takes place over the roofs of the favelas, reminiscent of the Bourne Ultimatum scene in Morocco. Yes, the story is improbable, but we still are allowed to have fun with it. I didn't get into the movie that much until the second half of the film, but let me say that the second part really delivers. This movie also has the best ending and it really leaves you expecting the sixth part, which I really didn't feel that excited about in the other films. Fans of the franchise will surely be satisfied and Fast Five might even add a few new converts along the way because it is the best one so far. The soundtrack is also great and Don Omar really is hilarious in this movie. He delivered most of the funny scenes in the film. Ludicrous and Tyrese Gibson also did their part in sharing the workload. It was just good seeing all these characters together and the cameo in the ending is just the cherry on the pie. I was surprisingly entertained with Fast Five.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",Fast Five

59,sauravjoshi85,A Much needed rejig for the franchise,8,9 September 2021,"Fast Five aka Fast & Furious 5 or Fast & Furious 5: Rio Heist is a heist action film directed by Justin Lin and written by Chris Morgan. The film stars Vin Diesel, Late Paul Walker, Jordana Brewster, Tyrese Gibson, Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges, Matt Schulze, Sung Kang, Tego Calderon, Don Omar, Gal Gadot, Dwayne Johnson, and Joaquim de Almeida.The film is the fifth installment in fast and furious series.This film is one of the best film of the series and with the introduction of Dwayne Johnson has gave the much needed boost to the series and also the credit should be given to makers by instilling new life in the series by introducing heist along with some car chases as the car racing were getting too monotonous. This step had not only increased the viewers base but also leased a new life in the franchise.The plot and the screenplay is flatly predictable but is still enjoyable, the funny scenes here and there will keep you entertained and the fast paced screenplay will keep you engaged.The stunts and action in the film is marvelous and few of the action scenes and stunts can be called as the major highlights of the film.Acting is good to decent and almost all the characters were honest and dedicated to their character, the only drawback which i felt was that the character of the antagonist in the film was not cooked properly or was under shadowed in the hoard of another actors. This role should've been developed more precisely and if they would have done the film could've been more grand, but sadly in this film the villain looked too week and isn't memorable.Climax of the film is also predictable as it's plot but is very entertaining and gives a satisfying pleasure. If you are a fan of fast and furious series or if you are a fan of heist series then this is the film for you. A much needed rejig for the franchise and eventually saved the franchise.",Fast Five
60,Enchorde,Typical Fast and the Furious,7,26 September 2011,"Fast Five is the fifth installment in the Fast and the Furious franchise, the second since the series was reclaimed by Vin Diesel and the gang. Since it is the fifth, there are no real surprises as to what the basis of the story is. They still are expert drivers that drives fast and real expensive cars. This time they end up in Brazil, fugitives from their break out at the end of the last movie.A heist goes awry, and they end up becoming enemies to the top crime lord in Rio. At the same time the U.S. sends its best agent to apprehend them all. Suddenly Toretto and his friends must wage a battle at two fronts.It is a good action, with some good stunts and effects, and some spectacular driving. Exactly what I have come to expect from a Fast and the Furious movie. Diesel is good as Toretto, and his match up with Dwayne Johnson is good. It is also good to see the characters from all the different movies get together.In all, it is an entertaining movie, but it lacks the element of surprise, or the edge to give something really extra. It delivers what I expected, but not much of anything else. Still, it was good enough that I will most probably watch the next one.6/10",Fast Five

Along with also with the Rock as he is a great ""antagonist"" for the company of Dom, Brian, among others. As we see Brian and his girlfriend, Dom's sister breaking out Dom while he was going to do hard time two years ago in ""Fast & Furious.""

But not before there is a huge payday of $100M that brings back people like Tyrese Gibson from the other Furious movies. In order to accomplish this goal. But federal agent Luke Hobbs, played by Dwayne the Rock Johnson. Is in the way as he and his gang seek to apprehend the gang. While Hobbs is a bit of a you know what at times. He means well and that he is is like the Tommy Lee Jones character of ""The Fugitive."" Relentless and no-nonsense. The cop that is accompany Hobbs, played by Spanish actress Elsa Pataky is also had a past with Dom. As you will find out why. Great action and non-stop from top to bottom.

63,masonsaul,Best Fast and Furious yet,9,26 July 2019,Fast Five successfully revitalises the Fast and Furious franchise and is by far the best Fast and Furious yet by being knowingly ridiculous and over the top. The returning cast from across the previous four films are all great and have fantastic chemistry. The core theme of family is stronger than ever.

Only negative I have is the forgettable villain.,Fast Five
64,SnakesOnAnAfricanPlain,Fast & Furious 5 (2011),4,13 December 2011,"This film lost me in the first few minutes. A rescue operation sees Paul Walker flipping over a bus about ten times to save one person. This stupid scene is followed by a TV news reporter stating ""miraculously no one was hurt"". This is such lazy writing that it annoys me no end. Why not think of something clever, rather than this moronic idea. I'm all for suspending disbelief, but there's no reason to exploit an audience like that. It happens again later, where characters, inexplicably, have knowledge or skills not previously assigned to them. All the characters say is ""I had a life before you knew me!"" This isn't good enough, it's just lazy. This basically means that anything can happen in this movie, and the writers are using get out of jail free cards. On top of that the franchise has lost the racing entirely, at one point building up to a race and then cutting to the conclusion. At times I thought I was watching Bourne. It all adds up to a roll call of previous characters, and an ending that sees Diesel using a safe chained to his car as a weapon, and not just one of destruction, he is able to aim this with all the precision of an Olympic archer. It's a bizarre beast, as it takes itself the most seriously out of all the movies, but comes across as the dumbest.",Fast Five
65,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,"Still a fun entry, but beginning to go beyond plausibility",6,15 January 2015,"Once Fast & Furious (2009) came back on the scene, reuniting Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker), Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and the rest of his crew, knowing sequels were on the way was more than just foresight. The hints were given not only with films prior, but also with teaser footage in the post credits. Amazingly, it has also been one of the few franchises that keeps on going no matter what critics have said previously. However, this is the film that not only topped all of the other installments and was favored the most by critics, but also began to bring the franchise full circle (kind of). Continuing immediately after the last film, O'Conner and his crew break out Dominic Toretto and flee to Brazil. Nonetheless, this does not stop the US government from sending another federal lawman to bring in O'Conner and Toretto. His name is Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson), and he's determined to get the job done that O'Conner failed to do time and again.Once in Brazil, Toretto and Co. decide that the only way to be free of all the trouble they've been in for for the last number of films is to rob Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida), a drug lord who controls the local area and use his money to disappear entirely. To do this, O'Conner and Toretto call in their contacts, which span from the prior sequels. Joining the gang is Roman Pierce (Tyrese Gibson), Tej Parker (Ludacris), Han (Sung Kang) and others. The great thing is, the fans of the franchise will definitely enjoy seeing the characters combine forces from beginning to end. Screenwriter Chris Morgan has certainly been improving the way the stories are being told for these characters. My question is since Morgan only began writing for the franchise at The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006), did he plan this from that point? If so, he certainly knows how to plan ahead.Sadly for timeline continuity, Chris Morgan still hasn't made any sense to why The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006) was written first if that came later. It gets annoying to think about when trying to make sense of it all. To be honest though, the best part about Morgan's screenplay to this entry is the fact that it no longer focuses on revenge, trying to pick sides or anything near that. It's all about breaking free from old chains and it's something everyone strives for in life. There's nothing to say about acting because anyone watching this movie has either followed this franchise from the start or will become attached from here. All the actors maintained their characters charm and personality. It is surprising to see how some of the actors look now though. A lot of the male actors have beefed up considerably, from Vin Diesel, Dwayne Johnson and Matt Schulze. They got huge! Another impressive visual component is that the cars used are no longer on a high color pallet with neon paint and LED lights made to look and sound like your regular urban crotch rocket. Here, they use slick, dark colored, modern high performance cars and it looks less infantile in style and that's good. The action / racing is another good element that entertains to a point. I say this because at some points in the movie, the physics do not exactly apply and because this is in a ""real-world"" setting, what happens in some action scenes aren't the most plausible. There's only so much strain a regular car chassis can handle compared to a van or compared to a truck. Another thing that might annoy people depending on ethnicity is that no subtitles are used for when people speak in foreign languages. It's one thing if its brief but it happens more than enough times for people who are not fluent in the language to get confused. The final visual aspect to the film is Stephen F. Windon's cinematography. Considering that he's been on board this franchise since The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006), it seems that he knows what to look for as well. Plus, since this is a car-related movie, one would need a nice backdrop for viewers to look at while things are going on and that's what Windon does here. Much of his shots include beautiful scenery of the Brazilian landscape; from the mountains to urban terrain. Finally, completing the listening experience is Brian Tyler's musical composition. Like much of the other music he produced for the prior entries, again going back to The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006), it's fairly generic music. However, Tyler is able to convey the right tunes for the sentimental moments and action cues. To do this, like he's done in the past, he's used a mix of electronic synths and an actual orchestra. So far, he's doing a good job but hopefully he'll make a more memorable theme for the franchise at some point.Viewers should enjoy the direction in which their favorite characters go from here. Plus, rejoining the cast from prior entries, adding new characters and maturing the visual style is an added bonus. The only quip fans may have are the omitted subtitles and the action does entertain, but may get a bit out of control for its realistic setting.",Fast Five
66,eric262003,Sequels Are Getting Better Through Time,8,23 April 2012,"Like a fine wine, ""The Fast and the Furious"" franchise just gets better and in ""Fast Five"" my theory reigns true. The first part of the installment was high-flying and vastly exciting. Then the sequel came out which was not up to hype as its predecessor was, and then I was starting to give up hope once ""Tokyo Drift"" was released, yes it was that bad. I really had lowered expectations when ""Fast and the Furious"" was released and to my surprise it rejuvenated my confidence in the franchise, but ""Fast Five"" exceeds all my expectations as one of the best movies of the bunch which is rare in the realm of tiring sequels and lazy remakes that the movie industry surreptitiously likes to promote. I mean ""Lethal Weapon"" has had very good sequels in its heyday and ""The Terminator"" not to mention ""Rocky"" as well. I never expected this franchise would survive the test of time; it's like an underdog in its own right.The story on ""Fast Five"" is well above average. It's like a continuation from where we left off from the previous installment. The story involves Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and the gang conjures up a way to escape the seemingly endless array of escaping from the law and family issues. There's another subplot that centers on a drug kingpin and a missing computer chip. If you have a DVR you could fast forward those scenes because they're really not worth mentioning. Which is all good, but the main purpose to see this movie isn't due to the brilliant performances or a scintillating script. The hell with that! You're here for the exhibition of colorful, high-energized cars, the endless nonstop action and the attractive ladies. That's why you come to see this kind of movie.As I mentioned before ""Fast Five"" won't win any Oscars or Golden Globes, but you know what? Who really give a damn? The performers like Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Dwayne Johnson, Jordana Brewster and Sang Kang are all out to have a great time. And the chemistry within the characters is quite mesmerizing.Of course it's all about the action in movies like these, which will leave you breathless. Such memorable scenes include the one where gangs confiscate cars from a moving train. Who in their right minds would do something so stupid and dangerous? Another is an awesome foot chase in the condemned slums of Brazil (the scenery is postcard perfect). It's where The Rock and The Vin embark in a battle that was one of the rare moments that was not dependent on CGI. Let's not forget about the climax but I won't give any spoilers away. Also be sure to stay around for the end credits to know what the next installment will be about.Overall ""Fast Five"" offers exhilarating action, backed up with scintillating visuals, with a compelling story to keep you on edge and great acting for those who love action flicks.",Fast Five

Dwayne Johnson is a perfect addition to the cast and his confrontations with Diesel's character is among the many highlights of the film, plus it's good to see the old cast members back in action.

It's the best ""Fast and Furious"" movie by far, an adrenaline shot of pure guilt pleasure that promises and delivers white-knuckle thrills and edge-of-your-seat excitement.Certainly that's the expectation thanks to an exhilarating opening sequence where our favourite recalcitrant criminal Dominic Toretto and his newly-minted criminal associate Ryan O'Connor are off stealing luxury race cars on board a moving train. Besides federal agents, Dom and O'Connor also have to contend with double-crosses and oh, a looming bridge. So when you have our heroes leaping out of a speeding car while plunging into a ravine, you know you better buckle up for the ride you're going to be in for.A memory jolt for those who may have forgotten- Dom was arrested at the end of the last movie, and was sentenced without parole to 25 years in federal prison. But where's the fun in having him behind bars? So en route to a maximum security prison, Dom's transport is promptly ambushed by Ryan and his girlfriend Mia (Jordana Brewster). The trio end up in Rio, where said daring midday heist occurs and lands them on the wrong side of Rio's most feared criminal kingpin Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida).True to Dom's nature, he seizes it as an opportunity to do one big score and then go off to relax. With this nifty twist, screenwriter Chris Morgan (also the writer of the previous three films) turns what used to be a movie around the confines of the underground street racing circuit into a heist movie. Morgan also does an Ocean's Eleven as Dom assembles just about every supporting character who has appeared in one of the franchise's films for his latest crew- including Roman (Tyrese Gibson), Tej (Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges), Han (Sung Kang) and Gisele (Gal Gadot).The chemistry between the returning cast and characters is delightful, and Morgan reserves the best zingers in his script for their banter. New additions Tego Calderón and Don Omar also add to the fun, their mutual riffs on Tej that exploit the language barrier between the two Americans simply hilarious. Of course, the highlight of this movie is really the introduction of just about the most badass F.B.I. agent from up North, Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson), sent into Rio to apprehend Dom and O'Connor.The relentlessness of Johnson's Hobbs is a good foil against the arrogance of Diesel's Dom, and their subsequent mano-a-mano no-holds-barred fistfight that results is brutally efficient. Indeed, watching Diesel and The Rock go up against each other is worth the price of admission itself, because there simply is no one bigger, badder and balder than Diesel. It's a duel made in action heaven, and director Justin Lin milks it for every punch, kick and body-smash it is worth.But Lin isn't content to rest on the laurels of his hulking action stars. A footchase across rooftops and down alleyways of the crowded, crime-ridden hillside favelas (neighborhoods) of Rio surpasses the sheer adrenaline that Jason Bourne induced in ""The Bourne Ultimatum"", and makes great use of its locale's backdrop. The finale, though, is quite something in itself and beats anything that Lin has done, or for that matter, anything that you have seen so far in the ""Fast and Furious"" franchise. We're not about to spoil the surprise for you here, but suffice to say that it will go down as one of the most breathtaking car chase sequences in cinematic history.And with that, ""Fast Five"" has more than about justified its existence by being a souped-up, pumped-up, revved-up action movie that floors its throttle from the get-go and doesn't let up for a full two hours. Yes, there are times when the dialogue borders on laughable, especially when Morgan tries to give his characters- Dom in particular- more depth and some semblance of character development.But this is not a movie that you watch for those things, and a franchise that was built on these things- rather ""Fast Five"" is about revving engines, crashing cars, brawny men and hot babes and on every one of these counts, it delivers spectacularly. We guarantee you by the time the end credits roll with a sneak peek of where the franchise is headed to next, you'll be cheering for the sixth ""Fast and Furious"" film.",Fast Five
71,Luigi Di Pilla,I expected more action and it was too long,5,11 September 2011,"After I have read all the positive international reviews I thought this must be a real action movie and above all the best one of this franchise. But I was wrong because in my opinion there were only three great respectable scenes with full of adrenaline. The remaining story was too long. The running time could have been reduced at maximal 95 minutes. There were dialogs where I felt nearly asleep. The characters and actors didn't convince me. Then I missed a fresh and intelligent story with intriguing, mysterious or adventure elements to take me definitely on a great ride in Rio. The story is so simply sticked as in The Expendables or Swordfish. That's why this movie is far away from blockbusters such as DIE HARD, TERMINATOR, JAMES BOND or THE BOURNE IDENTITY series. I am so disappointed and I won't give another chance in future. Too overrated on IMDb. My vote is slow five out of ten.",Fast Five

(PG-13)With Walker firmly on the wrong side of the law now, Diesel and his ""family"" hightail it for Rio where they plot to lighten a crimelord's wallet by about $100 million. Meanwhile, federal agent and bounty hunter Johnson assembles a team to extract our dopey heroes and bring them to justice. As dumb and loud as one would expect from the fifth entry of this astonishingly venerable series, it's more in the spirit of heist movies like ""The Italian Job"" and ""Ocean's Eleven"" than the muscle car drive-in fodder that inspired the first few pictures. Whenever it attempts even a scintilla of dramatic/emotional underpinning, take a bathroom break, 'cause the only reason to tune in is for a series of thunderingly absurd action set pieces, which are mostly pretty entertaining (the big throwdown between Diesel and Johnson, though, has zero suspense since they both give and take blows like they were Terminators). Within about five minutes of his first appearance, one would prefer getting a foot crushed under a car's tire than hear another one of Gibson's obnoxious wisecracks; in fact, just muting it altogether would be for the best, provided the viewer's mouth is hydrated enough to constantly make their own ""vroom vroom!"" noises.54/100",Fast Five

There's less racing and more action in this one and it could well be the best of the series - intelligent, fun, exciting, and even some heart, this really does have it all - and it a great guys' popcorn movie.The action takes place in Rio - and after corrupt cops and the FBI all start chasing our heroes they decide to go for one last big score both for the money and revenge.Honestly, this is entertaining action, and an absolute knock-out of a movie - don't let the fact that this is the 5th installment fool you - this is full-blown with a real budget and action stars - all in all a truly entertaining movie.",Fast Five
76,Terryfan,Back together for round Five,8,3 April 2015,"Now when a long running series like The Fast And The Furious get sequels it is always a challenge to go out and try impress movie goers.However the series always tops itself with the recent sequels and Fast Five proof that's anything is possible with the right minds.The plot this time take place after Fast and Furious 4 left all with Brian O'Conner played by Paul Walker, Dominic Teretto Played by Vin Diesel, Mia Toretto played by Jordana Brewster head for Brazil to escape the law after a job with Vince Played by Matt Schulze went wrong. Which leads to them being hunted by Luke Hobbs Played by Dwayne Johnson who along with Elena Played by Elsa Pataky begin to hunt them down. Also returning are Roman Played by Tyrese Gibson, Tej Played by Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges, Han Played by Sung Kang, Gisele played by Gal Gadot. Reyes Played by Joaquim de Almeida who serves as the Film Main Antagonist.Story wise the plot is very good because it features the return of many of the characters from the series which is very good and moves the series along. Plus the film requires you to pay attention or you'll miss something. Plus you see the characters grow in this film from the last films.What drives the film like the other films is that the stunts from start to finish that defines The Laws of Physic and why I love this series because the cast and crew are always driven to push the limits and hold nothing back, Fast Five is the example of it.There is just a lot for this film that I recommend seeing for yourself where you'll be amazed and how you can do a sequel with the right minds.With awesome stunts, great action and plot you'll be glad you watch this film.I give Fast Five an 8 out of 10",Fast Five

78,Troy_Campbell,Best since the original.,7,21 April 2011,"""Home sweet home"" utters Diesel's beefcake criminal Dom Toretto to Walker's baby-faced ex-cop Brian O'Conner as they sit in Toretto's souped up muscle car ready to race along the streets of Rio de Janeiro. There's more than a hint of irony in this; fans of the Fast franchise will know exactly what Dom means. The sequels spawned from the highly successful first film have been a mixed bag appealing to different tastes. Some have been mildly entertaining in their own way, but the one major issue they've all shared is a lack of recurring characters and follow-on narratives. 2009's Fast & Furious partially rectified that by having the main four from the original movie return, but it's this fifth entry that really starts to bring the whole series together.There's supporting characters from every instalment featured here – Matt Schulze's Vince from number one; Tyrese's big-mouthed Roman and Ludicrous' Tej from 2 Fast 2 Furious; Sung Kang's charismatic Han from Tokyo Drift; and Gal Gadot's sexy Gisele from F&F – with a post-credits cameo to cap it off. Scribe Chris Morgan has obviously done his homework as, in addition to the 'who's who' line-up of co-stars, there are references to the previous movies (and characters that don't appear) and he introduces subplots that help build on earlier story lines. This integration of the Fast universe, along with the marvellously tongue-in-cheek mood, notches up a level of interest not before seen in the car-crazy franchise.After taking a new course with Tokyo Drift, and failing to impress with Fast & Furious, filmmaker Justin Lin has well and truly ignited the series with exciting set pieces and lashings of well placed humour. He still struggles to effectively call the shots when exposition (or mere conversation) is required; however he clearly has a handle on shooting the various fast-paced action scenes. There is a spectacular heist of luxury cars aboard a train (with a marvellously ridiculous denouement); a Bourne-esque free-running chase along roof tops; and a bruising hand-to-hand melee between The Rock and big Vin.Of the major stars, it's Fast newcomer Dwayne Johnson who shines the brightest. His epic bad-ass cop makes Toretto look like an absolute sissy, which is no easy feat. He also boasts many of the film's greatest lines and comes away looking the least corny – something Diesel and Walker are evidently use to by now. The chalk and cheese pairing of the two wannabe action stars brings with it a decent slab of shonky acting. Chrome-domed Diesel is especially silly and unconvincing when required to open his mouth, but he looks good behind the wheel of a car and adds plenty to the unapologetic macho atmosphere.Thanks to Morgan's decent script, Lin's solid grasp on the action and Johnson's tough-as-nails turn, this latest addition to a franchise that appeared to be running on fumes has just stepped on the gas.3.5 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Average, 3 - Good, 4 - Great, 5 - Brilliant)",Fast Five
79,vithiet,Best of the Franchise so far,6,31 December 2018,"Let's be honest: I found this whole franchise and what it's about supremely dumb and uninteresting. But to be fair, this one is entertaining.",Fast Five
80,blott2319-1,"Ridiculous and dumb, but I guess I can see why some like this film",6,25 September 2020,"I have often heard people say that The Fast and Furious franchise starts off a bit slow, but they get much more fun at Fast Five. So, I made the jump from the first one all the way to the fifth to see if people were right. I figure if this chapter in the saga doesn't work for me then it's clear that none of them are going to be my cup of tea. I will admit that it is more fun watching these guys as big-time international thieves than just a bunch of street-racing punks who steal DVD players. It's always a blast to see the tropes of a heist movie as our heroes assemble their team, devise their plan, and then execute the plan (dealing with any bumps in the road as they go.) I didn't feel like I missed much in character development by skipping some of the movies. I just accepted that this team had grown closer, and moved up in the world from petty larceny to the point that they are pulling massive heists in non-extradition countries. It also seemed fairly obvious that they expected us to like them all despite the fact that they were convicted criminals on the run from the law. Finally, I understood the sly references to Tokyo Drift, because I've heard many times before that it takes place after these films.I do like some of what they are trying to do with the franchise in Fast Five, but I struggle with it as well because it feels like they are taking everything so seriously. This doesn't feel like a fantasy world, and yet these men and women are superhuman. They can survive anything, they never get shot, and we even watch Vin Diesel break a pair of metal restraints with nothing but brute strength. Also, I'm not a car guy, so all the time spent drooling over luxury sports cars and watching them race in circles was kind of dull for me. Plus, these aren't even real cars because they have supernatural powers just like their drivers. The big chase at the end is one of those things that is meant to be pure fun, but I was sitting there baffled that this made any logical sense. A fleet of semis couldn't pull that much weight at those speeds, let alone a couple of cars. Not to mention all the civilians that must have been killed by that huge thing swinging around as they raced down the street. So much for the family being good guys, they are mass murderers! It seems that Fast Five has proven, even when they make some improvements to their formula to increase the level of fun, the required suspension of disbelief (and interest in cars) is too much for me to enjoy.",Fast Five
81,educallejero,The longest and brainless yet! Also the best,6,27 March 2019,"Finally, on 2011 they went all super-hero (or anti-hero, really).And that went well for the series because it meant less emotional/character driven scenes (there are a handful of 2 minutes ""scenes"" of such kind, and while bad, they are there just to explain the motivations of the characters).The one thing that made this one better than the original is that there is a more ""Ocean's Eleven"" kind of plot, and even if you do have to turn your brain off to enjoy it, it works and its more elaborated than the others of the franchise.Again, not even a bit realistic at anything, but it doesn't really try to be, in my opinion. Less races and more chases with more action improved this thing.",Fast Five
82,phubbs,Fast Five,5,19 September 2013,"A new film, a new venture and a whole new never ending stream of super modded cars for Toretto and his crew. No need for explanations on how they get these cars, they just get them, deal with it people.Fairly disappointing, overly long and actually slightly dull new chapter in this chav/hip hop racer franchise. Amazing it has lasted this long really but the films have been a roller coaster of quality for me. First film was a boy racer flick complete with dumb neon underside lighting but fairly original and fun. Second film was a bit of a rehash with colourful new street racer characters and dripping in bling...was pretty awful. Third film was a straight to the shops deal which many didn't like BUT is actually by far the most superior of the franchise due to the excellent and very realistic drift racing making it a proper street racing film. The fourth film regroups the original cast and has a drug running plot. This means the street racing has been pushed to one side in favour of generic action man hokum.Now we have number five which seems to have ditched a lot of the street racing element and is more of an out n out heist flick. Along the lines of 'The Italian Job' remake with flashy over the top car/people stunts, the usual regular clichéd team of criminals and the usual regular clichéd breaking in techniques that we've seen so often now we could all break into banks ourselves. Still impressed with the cast continuity though I gotta admit. Everyone is back again including Bridges from number 2 and Schulze all the way from the very first film. It is also of course the first introduction of Dwayne Johnson into the franchise and he fits in perfectly in all honesty. He stands around barking orders with his chest puffed out, arms glistening and holding large weapons.There is a hint of street racing but that's all we get...a hint, we don't see the guys winning their fast cars. I think the stupidest scene in the film is where they race police cars together, they just waltz in and steal four cruisers, apparently, then try to make us believe that these regular police cruisers are fast souped up motors!! and manual!...they do realise the US mainly uses auto? (of course they used fast cars in reality as stand in's).Highlight is the fight between Diesel and Johnson, two big slapheads grunting n sweating over each other which is pretty decent but after that it gets silly again as both Johnson and his female partner decide to join Toretto and his criminals in the heist! The final big chase/escape sequence is impressive with tonnes of carnage and wreckage, your basic common destruction porn fix. It does admittedly command your attention, yet I wonder how many innocent people Toretto manages to kill right at the end.If you want street racing you won't find it here, this is a bank heist flick which isn't too original. Reasonable mindless fun but nothing new, seen this kind of thing so many times and this offers nothing new. This film marks the end for the street racing aspect in this franchise and enters the saturated action heist genre. On a final note I might add...there's no way Toretto's Dodge Charger could ever compete against Brian's Skyline GTR at the end. How many times are they gonna try and show this to us??5/10",Fast Five
83,jon.h.ochiai,Vin and The Rock in Summer Fun Movie,9,14 May 2011,"Showcasing Director Justin Lin's signature accelerated precision, Vin Diesel's Dom races beside the speeding train as Paul Walker's Brian leaps into Dom's sports car. Their car immediately careens over a steep chasm into the river below. Diesel and Walker leap in midair out of the car, and plunge into the water. ""Fast Five"" is just great fun. Writer Chris Morgan's story is better than the last ""Fast and Furious"", which isn't saying much. Then again we don't see ""Fast Five"" for the narrative nuances. Non-stop action reigns supreme. Lin has a crisp vibrant visual style, and acumen for insane action. Lin has two cars racing through the streets of Rio dragging a bank vault unleashing mass destruction. Granted this is over the top, and completely original. ""Fast Five"" has stunning Rio de Janeiro locals, gorgeous women, fast cars, and Vin Diesel squaring off against ""The Rock"" Dwayne Johnson. Lin has methodically checked off all the boxes.The theme of family distinguishes ""Fast Five"" from completely superfluous fare. In a quiet moment Dom reminisces about his father. He remembers him working all day, and staying up late at night helping his sister Mia with her homework. He recalls the generous neighborhood barbecues he had. Conversely, Brian has regrets about his father, ""He just wasn't around."" Perhaps he has chance to alter his fate. Amidst the flash, ""Fast Five"" earnestly adheres to family and loyalty.The band is back together in ""Fast Five"", for one last heist. If I am not mistaken one of the band, Han played by Sung Kang died in a previous Lin directed sequel. Stranger things have happened. The accelerated opening sequence recaps the rescue of Dom Toretto, where the last movie ended. Federal agent Brian O'Connor and Dom's sister Mia (Jordana Brewster) daringly execute the operation to free Dom from serving an undeserved life sentence. In context what else could that be? Dom risked his life to help Brian solve a heinous crime and bring killer to justice. Lin throttles the adrenaline and velocity in this deadly game of chicken with a prison bus. This is only an omen of things to come.As ""Fast Five"" resumes, Mia (Brewster) and Brian (Walker) have been on the run in Rio. They are seeking to rendezvous with Dom (Diesel). Dom has one last heist in mind: robbing the bank vault in the Rio Police Station with $100 million of crime lord Reyes (slick and villainous Joaquim de Alemeida). Apparently, Reyes' rule and influence knows no bounds in Rio. So Dom assembles his old team. Dwayne Johnson, massive hard muscle, shaved head and goatee, plays singular and intense Federal Agent Hobbs, who is out to bring Dom to justice. He instructs Rio official to ""Stay the f*** out of my way."" Hobbs and his team always get their man. As Hobbs, Johnson is imposing and handles guns and his fists with explosive results. Of course we are waiting for Vin to take on The Rock in the final epic battle. Chris Morgan ingeniously stacks the story. Dom is the thief with a code. Hobbs is the cop with honor. Reyes is the true villain. Much like gravity, we can kind of figure how things will fall.Predictability is some of the charm of ""Fast Five"". Vin Diesel plays to his minimalist strength as Dom. Emotive is not his deal, but that is not required here. He commands the screen, and often surprises in his underplay. Paul Walker has become a pretty good actor. Not much is demanded of him here. He deftly uses his charm and smarts. The Rock is great as Hobbs. He imposes as a formidable rival. Here Johnson's straight arrow persona leverages the story's ultimate conflict. ""Fast Five"" is not going to win any awards. It is just great fun. I look forward to the next sequel.",Fast Five
84,Holt344,Fast Five has a great set of characters and is action packed from start to finish - My Ultimate Review,10,11 June 2021,"Fast Five or Fast & Furious 5: Rio Heist as it's also known as, it's the third Fast & Furious film Justin Lin have directed and it's once again written by Chris Morgan. This installment gets the franchise to the action and roots that made me fall in love with the Fast films, gripping and suspenseful action sequences that make you sit at the edge of your seat. The focus on heists is the right move, they make it brilliant and entertaining, how a box office hit should be and succeeded. I won't lie the logic in these movies disappear more and more but they are entertaining. Having this movie take place in Brazil and Rio was an excellent choice. Also the cast and likeable characters are all memorable. Justin Lin's direction is one of the highlights in Fast Five, absolutely amazing. Chris Morgan's story and script is a huge step forward than the previous film, he did a great job. The dialogue was at times below average but I don't mind bad dialogue if the characters and actors execution is good and they are.Fast Five continues where the previous film left off. It follows Dominic Toretto, Brian O'Conner and their team as they plan a heist to steal $100 million from corrupt businessman Hernan Reyes while being pursued for arrest by U. S. Diplomatic Security Service agent Luke Hobbs. The ensemble cast has Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Jordana Brewster, Tyrese Gibson, Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges, Matt Schulze, Sung Kang, Tego Calderon and Gal Gadot. The new additions are Dwayne Johnson as Luke Hobbs, Joaquim de Almeida as Hernan Reyes and Elsa Pataky as Elena Neves. The new cast members are appreciated and so is the returning cast.On the technical side of things, they really outdid themselves. The quality have gone up on every aspect, sound editing and the whole production. The editing still amazes me, action sequences and non action ones. The pacing is fast and fits perfectly with the film. The cinematography have improved too, I still love the camera work and how they edit the car sequences, truly masterly done by them.What I truly love about this film is how they use practical effect and all the stunts, Paul Walker did all of his stunts and I'm sure Vin Diesel did too. The stunt involving the flatbed truck slamming into the moving train was filmed practically, if I remember correctly the last sequence involving the bank vault was also done practically or at least most of it. The action feels real and it's thanks to the stunt coordinator and stuntmen.What the Fast Saga does well is that it never slows down, movies about cars should only get faster and Fast and Furious will never slow down. After many viewings, I still love this film. Dare I even say that it's one of my favorite action films.",Fast Five
85,Hollywood_Yoda,Still Shining Bright,9,18 May 2013,"First of all, let me say, BRAVO for the addition of Dwayne 'the Rock' Johnson to the cast of ""Fast & Furious 5"" by director Justin Lin. If any director knows how to keep a franchise fresh and invigorating for the viewer, it is him.The storyline is excellent and by the end, the viewer is saying to himself, ""what the heck?"" The twists and turns of F&F5 keep you guessing and wanting more. The story takes off right as ""Fast & Furious"" ended, with Dom heading to prison. But what you see at the beginning of F&F5 will blow you out of your seat if you haven't seen it already. It was amazing.The addition of the character Luke Hobbs (played by the Rock), an antagonist to Dominic Toretto (played by Vin Diesel) is a perfect casting job. Even as an authority figure, Hobbs is a very likable character. Kudos! If ""Fast & Furious 6"" is as amazing as this film, we are all in for a treat. And anticipation for ""Fast & Furious 7"" just as much, I hear that Jason Statham will be appearing in that film. Think of it as an ""Expendables"" on really fast wheels.",Fast Five

They are all cast from the previous installments. 
The Director brings all new actors in the cast crew: Joaquim de Almeida, Dwayne Johnson and Elsa Pataky. The script, the players, the action scenes, the story. Everything about this film is awesome! This film kicks ass. Is my second favorite best film in the series franchise. This film for me even beats Furious 7. Cause Furious 7 is not that good as this film is. The far of the highest best films ever. It's actually probably my favorite movie that I've ever seen. If you like any of the other fast and furious movies SEE THIS ONE!!!!! It's a Epic movie watch it till all the way to the end.Fast Five picks up, literally, right where Fast & Furious left off. Dom (Vin Diesel) is on his way to prison when his partner, former undercover detective Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker), and his sister Mia (Jordana Brewster) stage a daring (albeit highly unlikely) prison-bus break. On the run from the police, the FBI and the media, the three hightail it across the border and head even further south, all the way to Rio de Janeiro. There, they decide to lay down, lay low and avoid any unwanted attention. Nah, I'm just kidding. They do what any international fugitives would do: rob a train, double cross a local crime lord named Hernan Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida) and his right-hand man Zizi (Michael Irby), put themselves on the radar of a ludicrously musclebound U.S. Diplomatic Security Service agent (Dwayne Johnson), and set out to steal untold millions from Reyes. That's right, it's One Last Heist for Dom and Brian. Not that anyone should be foolish enough to think this is the last we'll see of the led-foot duo; not after Fast Five revved up $600 million at the worldwide box office. (Be sure to sit through the first chunk of end credits for a nice little surprise.) Fast Five boasts incredible action scenes that are all varied and equally exciting. The film is full of clean, well choreographed shots that are easy to watch and the cast works great as a whole unit, making the film's running time breeze by. The heist in Rio De Janeiro was amazing An energetic, high-octane. The film was brilliant and smart it was action fun Entertained. The fight scenes between Dwayne Jonson and Vin Diesel was tremendous. I was happy that they put someone (Dwayne Jonson) in the movie that was so smart like Dom (Vin Diesel) was. Luke Hobbs as A Diplomatic Security Service agent to track down Dom and his crew was awesome! He did a brilliant job In this Action packed sequel film! Just Lin deliver us a high octane Action packed story filled with full of cars and shootings in his film.Vin Diesel, Paul Walker and Dwayne Johnson lead this all-star all-action movie with outrageous stunts, incredible cars and beautiful girls that pushes the limits into the red and beyond! The legendary Dom Torreto (Vin Diesel) partners with outlaw cop Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) on the opposite side of the law in exotic Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Hunted by ruthless Agent Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) and an army of corrupt cops working for a deadly drug kingpin. Torreto and O'Conner reunite the gang from previous Fast adventures to pull off one last job - an insane heist worth $100 million! ""Five Times The Action!, Five Times the Fury!"" I love this film to death and I love how they were planning to rob a Police Station. The first half was a little boring, but the second half was fast paced entertained filled with action. I love this film and everything about it. I love that it is 2.hrs long so that it can tell the whole story.When developing Fast Five, Universal Studios deliberately departed from the street racing theme prevalent in previous films in the series, to transform the franchise into a heist action series involving cars. By doing so, they hoped to attract wider audiences that might otherwise be put off by a heavy emphasis on cars and car culture. Fast Five is considered the transitional film in the series, featuring only one car race and giving more attention to action set pieces such as gun fights, brawls, and the heist of $100 million. The production mounted a comprehensive marketing campaign, marketing the film through social media, virtual games, cinema chains, automobile manufacturers, and at NASCAR races.",Fast Five
88,FilmMan47,Too Much Quantity & Less Quality,6,8 May 2011,"this movie is the 5th installation in the series of fast & the furious..the first 4 maybe good or not but this on is a big let down. don know how it became a hit.only because of the rock(D-Johnson) & Vin Diesel. the plot shows that these people are planning something big & want to get big money.how they do it & how they escapes the cops & bad guys.the director showed too much of style,action & talking of the heist. but the story is filmed badly..i am sorry i did not like it.& in the end the cop(the rock) a fight here & there.cars,racing,money & other crap.its written by a kid i guess.a script full of foolishness.they get the container in the end & boom Vin diesel goes crazy with his car smashing everything..they are dragging that heavy container full of cash with wires & how the hell can it go too fast.unrealistic but i support Vin diesel still for him i say give it a chance guys.my rating for fast five 2011 is 6/10:Recommended",Fast Five
89,ajs-10,A return to form for the 'Fast & Furious' franchise,7,17 March 2012,"Very well shot with some truly spectacular driving stunts and special effects; the driving in this film is really excellent; hats off to all those involved in the stunt work! As for performances, well everybody did a decent job; Vin Diesel as Dominic Toretto and Paul Walker as Brian O'Conner, reprising roles from previous instalments were just as good as they were in the first film. Jordana Brewster as Mia Toretto did a decent job, as did Dwayne Johnson as the no-nonsense cop, Luke Hobbs. Also worthy of note were; Tyrese Gibson as Roman Pearce, Ludicrous as Tej Parker, Matt Schulze as Vince and Joaquim de Almeida as Hernen Reyes.You'd have thought a film about big men driving fast cars wouldn't be all that appealing, but this one does have a bit of something about it. No, it's not perfect by any stretch of the imagination, but it is entertaining in its own way and I can't knock it for that. The stunt work is excellent and the plot isn't all that bad as either. It does, however, require some knowledge of at least some of the previous films involving the main characters though. It works quite well as a caper/heist movie with a bit of an edge to it, although I did find a little too much time was spent with the 'good guys'. The city of Rio features very prominently and, for me, was also a bit of a star of the show. Over all, although it's not a great film, it's an entertaining film and one I have no problem in deeming Recommended.My Score: 7.2/10 IMDb Score: 7.3/10 (based on 105,098 votes at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 78/100 (based on 180 reviews counted at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Audience' Score: 83/100 (based on 104,318 user ratings counted at the time of going to press).You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",Fast Five
90,swilliky,The best of the franchise,8,15 April 2017,"Fast Five picks up right where the previous film ends, with Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) and Mia Toretto (Jordana Brewster) helping to free Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) from the prison bus. Brian and Mia go on the run but need to fund their escape so they meet up with Vince (Matt Schulze) to perform a train heist of cars where they meet up with Dom. This explosive action scene ends with Brian and Dom riding off a cliff and being captured by a new villain Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida) who wants to find the car Mia escaped in. Brian and Dom escape but they are even more wanted after the deaths of three DEA agents during the heist.On the trail of the criminals is Agent Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) who recruits the only Bazilian office he can trust Elena (Elsa Pataky). Brian and Vince do not get along causing tension between the crew. Vince is caught stealing a secret chip that belongs to Reyes. Brian, Mia, and Dom discover that this chip has important information of Reyes just as his henchmen and Hobbs crew assault their hideout leading to a chase through the favela. Dom encounters Elena and saves her life from thugs. Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com",Fast Five
91,witster18,A better option than many others in this genre.... EXTREMELY MILD spoilers,6,12 October 2011,"Better than the A-Team. Better than the Expendables. Better than xXx, Pitch Black, Battle L.A., and better than any film I can remember that stars either a UFC guy, or a WWE/WWF guy.That isn't saying much, BUT this most recent ""Fast and the Furious"" installment is loads of fun. Extremely predictable, extremely formulaic, but this film has great non-stop action, and while it's unbelievable, it's not as unbelievable as flying a tank through the air, or flying a bomber like a fighter jet....The ending is a little over-the-top, but at least there's a nice little twist(albeit somewhat predictable).Basically we have a film here that is exactly what you expect it to be - only it's so fast, so furious, and so well-done that it marginally escapes the normal verdicts.Really cool to see Vin Deisel and The ROck together, and you can tell that these two guys are a cut above the normal castings for these types of movies. They've been in the biz long enough to deliver their lines with emotion and confidence, and hold there own in every physical aspect.All that said; I probably won't watch it again. I wish I would have seen this on the big-screen though. It really is the definition of a big-budget(huge) popcorn-flick done right, but that also means that it's predictable, over-the-top, unbelievable, and not really my cup-of-tea...You should know where you stand going in, so if you decide to give this one a try, I know you'll like it.Best in the series.64/100You'll like it if you liked: Fast and the Furious, Independence Day, Armegeddon, The Rundown, or Drive Angry.",Fast Five

No they did not improve on the acting but everything else is done much better. The dialouge and plot were much better this time around and the action scenes actually heart racing.This movie follows Dominic Toretto and his crew of street racers who plan a massive heist to buy their freedom while in the sights of a powerful Brazilian drug lord and a dangerous federal agent.This movie was actually a pleasant surprise. After all the other sequels I was really going to give up on this franchise and Im really glad I didn't and decided to watch this one.,Fast Five
93,nicholls905-280-546911,Finally,7,24 April 2020,"The series was finally piecing it together in the last film but the storyline was slightly underdeveloped. Fast five manages to resuscitate the series and course correct it into something more fun and mainstream. If you look at how far the series has changed along the way, it's quite impressive. Justin Lin has grown into the saviour of the series and the film benefits from the style he started developing in Tokyo Drift. The film is growing in cast with each new film and while Diesel and Walker aren't the only reason people turn up, the hole required to replace them would. The series is now having fun with the premise but the idea of this film series running 10 movies is absolutely insane.",Fast Five
94,JohnRayPeterson,Another episode of a successful movie series; the fifth and likely not the last.,8,11 October 2011,"Read the full IMDb Storyline of Fast Five to get an overview of the plot. In my well founded opinion, to start with, this fifth episode is the first to have a realistic bridging of the ending of the previous episode and the setup for this current episode, the one with the highest rating of all five so far; it works well and immediately engages the hesitant audience who want nothing more than a believable continuation.All the action sequences of this fifth episodes are well done, very well done in fact, and do not suffer from inconsistent CGI and Fx quality, present in prior episodes; here, the quality is superior and effective throughout, a big plus and one I'm convinced contributed to the 7.4 rating (at time of my review). The cast which featured characters from all prior four episodes was another simple but sure way to maximize the production value. The last action sequences where the Dominic Toretto group pull their most daring and smartest heist is a gem. You'll want to replay that over.Let me provide you with some overview of the characters and the series so you can have an idea of where I believe the next sequel(s) will take us. The Fast and The Furious Original (2001) (rated 6.1), 2 Fast and 2 Furious (2003) (rated 5.2), The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006) (rated 5.6), Fast & Furious (2009) (rated 6.4) and finally ""Fast Five (2011) (rated 7.4). -Vin Diesel as Dominic Toretto in 2001, 2006(only as a brief closing scene consolidating his series value), 2009 and 2011. -Paul Walker as Brian O'Conner in 2001, 2003, 2009 and 2011. -Michelle Rodriguez as Letty in 2001, in 2009 (believed to have died in 2009), is in the 2011 ending, taunted to be alive (via a current dated picture) for the implicit sixth episode we should expect. -Jordana Brewster as Mia Toreto in 2001, in 2009 and 2011. -Tyrese Gibson as Roman Pierce in 2003 and in 2011. -Ludacris as Tej in 2003 and 2011. -Tego Calderon as Bandoleros in 2006 and as Tego in 2011. -Matt Schulze as Vince in 2001 and 2011 (dies). -Sung Kang in his role as Han from the 2006 and 2011. -Gal Gadot as Gisele in 2009 and in 2011. -Eva Mendes as Monica Fuentes in 2003 and appears as same at the end of 2011 along with Dwayne Johnson in the brief scene that leads to believe there will likely be a 6th episode. -Dwayne Johnson as Luke Hobbs introduced in 2011 near the middle of the 2011 film; at the end with Eva Mendes are taunted to appear in the sixth episode.I look forward to episode 6 and 7, which no doubt will feature at least Dwayne Johnson, Eva Menendez, Vin Diesel and hopefully Michelle Rodriguez for episode 6. I will venture a guess that episode could maintain a rating of 7 if the same writers and director of the last two episodes can hire the same special Fx and CGI bunch; the success of Fast Five should help the producers secure an adequate budget for the 6th episode. I trust, as evidenced by the 7.4 rating of 'Fast Five' that both episode 6&7 due to be produced in 2012, will be. I'm a fan who can now openly admit to it. Watch ""Fast Five"", perhaps you can become a fan as well. I don't mind commercial success if the quality holds up.",Fast Five
95,Christian_Dimartino,I may have enjoyed it more if I understood it one bit.,5,17 July 2011,"Paul Walker and Vin Deisel are back for yet another Fast and the furious film, Fast Five. Fast Five, in my opinion, will only appeal to those who love the series, and rednecks who love cars. Recently, I've been noticing a pattern in action films: After a while, the action sequences drag on for so long that you lose track of the plot. In Fast five, I was lost within 15 minutes, and the rest of the way.So, this is what I got out of the plot: Vince and Mia(Paul Walker and Jordanna Brewster) have to break Dom(Vin Deisel) out of jail. I forgot why he was in there because the last film was a blur. Once that happens, they stay in Rio and there's something to do with a heist and a ton of other stuff.I've seen four of these films, and would say that this one is one of the better ones. Director Justin Lin is talented with the action sequences, I just wish that he could go deeper into the plot. There are a lot of characters, such as a sympathetic cop and some politician villain or something, I don't know.Dwayne Johnson(I still call him The Rock but whatever, he's bigger than that now I guess) gives a dreadful performance as one of the cops on their tail. I have known for a long time about how bad of an actor he is, and he proves it here.So, I didn't exactly like it, but that doesn't mean you won't. I'm sure that the film will appear to others, but i'm different from everyone else. I like a little story to follow, I like mind benders that explain themselves. Not a car movie that goes too fast.C+",Fast Five

You pull up to the speeding train, matching its exact speed, as you deftly cut the entire side of the box car with a blow torch. You hop in and deftly park a Ford GT onto the tractor rig not once, but twice. Then you drive a Corvette Stingray off the speeding train; the car crashing 15 feet onto the bumpy desert terrain off a speeding train and it causes no more damage than a small pothole. You speed the Corvette down bumpy desert terrain and are headed straight for the steel girder of a bridge spanning a 500 ft. deep gorge as a guy jumps off a train onto the car at the last split second.The girder apparently moved out of the way. You jump from the car as it hurtles downward off the cliff towards the water; a much longer plunge than from the Golden Gate Bridge and you pop up from the water, unscathed, as if you had just dove into a pool. You're then strung up suspended by chains in a warehouse but simply snap out of the chains just before the bad guys torture you and escape....All this happens after a speeding prison bus collides with a black Accura sports car..and the car wins! The car is undamaged as the bus rolls a dozen times and lands upside down with none of the handcuffed prisoners having been killed...and did the Rock take acting lessons from OJ?...This film is unconscionable garbage and is not worth watching.",Fast Five
99,anselmdaniel,A fun heist in Rio,7,3 October 2020,"This review contains spoilers.Fast Five is the sequel to Fast & Furious and is the fifth installment of The Fast and the Furious franchise. This movie takes place after the fourth installment and follows the Fast and the Furious crew as they attempt a heist to steal money from a corrupt businessman. The crew are pursued by Luke Hobbs, a United States Diplomatic Security Service agent played by Dwayne Johnson.Fast Five is an incredibly fun movie to watch. The plot is actually comprehensible like the first and the third movie in the franchise. The plot is basic but at the least it does not have seemingly random reasons for events to happen. This movie has a plot and build up to the heist that is fun, coo, and exciting to watch.The action of the movie does require the viewer to suspend their disbelief as impossible things happen on the screen. If the audience can do this, they can watch creative action scenes that are well shot and edited. The finale especially does a good job with making the entire movie engaging as the heist unfolds.The cast in general does a decent job. One typically does not watch these movies for the acting. The highlight in this movie is Luke Hobbs. Dwayne Johnson does a great job playing an indestructible agent that is focused on the mission. This character is played straight which leads him into funny situations. Dwayne Johnson has great delivery as this character. Most of all the scenes that he is in feel as if both Dwayne Johnson and the crew are having a lot of fun.I would recommend Fast Five. This movie is a solid entry in The Fast and the Furious franchise and is an incredibly fun movie.Grade: B",Fast Five

Even crazier stunts than the previous installments, really silly dialogue and tired drama about family values. That's pretty much it.There are also an abundance of characters that are totally uninteresting and underused, just because the plot demands that they participate in the heist. I think that's the reason why the running time of the movie is 25 minutes longer than the others.We also get the most boring villain and a character from the first movie who is pretty stupid on the surface, but seems to think more logical than all of the other characters combined. Luckily, he gets a hero's send off. Oops! I gave away his demise. Sorry.This sequel is also the worst offender of setting up characters' point of view and then suddenly make them do 180s for no apparent reason. And to top it all of, it has the most ridiculous car chase in history which is pretty cool, but by then I pretty much lost interest in how it was gonna turn out. Also, you pretty much know that you can't have our heroes die or punished. So it ends pretty much how you expect.One thing also. Both Walker and Diesel look terribly out of shape. One scene has Diesel pulling up a wounded Dwayne Johnson and I kept thinking that he was gonna dislocate something. Anyway, my commentary is done. There is no point of giving out a rating but I'll give it a 2, just for the effort of giving us a car chase that you definitely haven't seen so much.",Fast Five
104,LazySod,Somewhat failed attempt at popcorn,6,18 May 2011,"Picking up the story where the previous one left off this one doesn't need much explaining story wise - the gang is still up to no good and using fast cars to do it. This time the scenery has changed to Southern America, Brazil to be exact.The theme of the films being fast cars, fast driving and action sequences galore this one does not fail to deliver. There's plenty of all of that. When it comes to adding something new to the series it does fail a bit though - it's just more of the same. Add to that the fact that most of the story is more than a little ludicrous and the end result is easily derived: if one is able to dislodge ones brain for the duration of the film then it can be enjoyed otherwise it can't.For me the turning point was the point where it became clear there were no characters to bond with. Every single one of them should be locked away for life. One can't care for characters like that - whether they live or die, escape or get caught, it doesn't matter. It makes the film flimsy and too easily forgotten.6 out of 10 corns not yet fully popped.",Fast Five
105,Rickting,Unrestrained blockbuster fun,8,16 March 2014,"I haven't watched the first four so this is my first F&F movie. I really like action movies and this did look pretty fun, so I decided just to start at the good bit. I have often heard people describe these movies as guilty pleasures but they shouldn't be. There is nothing embarrassing about liking this film or the sixth instalment. These are sleek, supreme, well executed thrill machines which know they're ridiculous and OTT and don't care at all. Ironically, that improves everything. By the sound of it, the others were just about car races, but this one is about Dominic Toretto and his hugely likable crew robbing a bank in Brazil. Dwayne Johnson in a career best performance is the agent who comes to Brazil to stop them. As one would expect, this couldn't care less about those who aren't action fans, and the length of 131 minutes is a bit much. The film does go on a bit, but it compensates with its nutty, jaw dropping, ballistic finale in which a safe is towed through the streets of Brazil.Dwayne Johnson is excellent, and his character easily overshadows Vin Diesel's deeply boring protagonist. The film contains the best 'One use of strong language' in a 12 ever, and the script is surprisingly good. It's humorous and genuinely fun, and the characters are all likable. Justin Lin, despite his evident lack of physics knowledge, shows himself to be a thoroughly able action director. Some set pieces work better than others (for example a car race in the middle of the film is well done while a train set piece is just a bit much) but the film nails the right tone throughout. It's got plenty of humour and never takes itself too seriously. This is just pure fun. No sentimentality. No cringe inducing love stories. Barely any exposition. Just pure, endless fun. This is the ultimate popcorn flick and is actually a bit different from other movies of its type as its set pieces are so OTT they are pretty much unforgettable. So yes it rudely ignores all of those who aren't already fans and yes it's too long and yes it suffers from the boring action hero problem that plagued the Bourne and Mission Impossible films, but who cares? It's fun. Sometimes that's all we need. Get some popcorn. Sit back. Enjoy. You'll be glad you did.8/10",Fast Five
106,dilipbts,Fast five,8,10 June 2020,"This is the film that single-handedly got me to give the rest of the series a shot, for better or worse. It's a nice change of pace from the previous films where it abandons the street race angle (how far could you have taken that anyway?) and goes into the direction of a heist action flick with cars. Dwayne Johnson is a great addition and really adds to the series embracing the goofiness of its premise. So yeah, still the best this franchise had, and that's kind of rare for a franchise on its fifth film. The action for the most part is really handled well and a lot of fun to watch. The cast as an ensemble are very charismatic which no doubt makes it more fun for audiences to see a cast that has so much diversity and it's not done with generic stereotypes but just a bunch of people with a common interest.

110,CinematicInceptions,Exhibits some of the most common problems of action movies.,6,13 May 2017,"Prior to seeing this installment, I had rather enjoyed the other movies I'd seen of this series. Despite the fact that they are very action driven, formulaic in plot, and over the top, they at least held my attention and were somewhat exciting. From what I had seen and heard, I was under the impression that this number five was supposed the best in the series. But actually it was the movie that alerted me to everything I don't like about this series.I want to highlight how destruction was handled in the climatic car chase scene. Cars are flipping and blowing up and smashing into other cars and buildings. The big safe is ripping through everything it touches and is sliding out of control. And yet the only fatalities are those of the corrupt cops chasing Brian and Dom. Now, I know why this is so. How can we like our protagonists if they kill innocent bystanders? It makes for unlikable heroes. But I think that is letting them off way too easy. In none of their planning do they make any mention of whether they are endangering the citizens of Rio. In reality, there would have been a lot of people killed, and I think it is wrong to not show any pedestrians dying in the destruction. It's expected that in movies reality is bent a little, particularly in big-scale entertainment movies like this. I get that. But I think it was done to an irresponsible degree in this case.Coupled with this is the likability of our protagonists. They are shown as sort of perfectly imperfect people. They're criminals with some character flaws, but then they've got these simple codes and beliefs that drive them. In the character's views, Dom in particular, whatever they do to keep their family together is acceptable. They're almost too easy to root for. In some other movies, Brian and Dom and the gang would be the villains, but since the opposition is morally worse than them, they become the good guys. I don't want to give the impression that I think all criminals are bad, they aren't. Breaking the law can be the right thing to do, and nowhere is that highlighted more than in some of my favorite movies. But in the case of this movie, I think that legal justice should have been conducted on the heroes. One would think that the action would be an upside for this movie, but this is only partially true. The grand-scale action kept me watching, and some of the one on one fights and foot chase scenes were engaging. But behind the spectacle and size is a disappointingly flat execution. There is very little drama behind the action scenes. There are lots of explosions and big gunfights, but these are not constructed or shot in a way that makes them really cool or exciting. For this reason, the lengthy car chases get somewhat monotonous. Also, by virtue of this being a summer entertainment flick, we as an audience know intuitively that all or at least most of our heroes will survive. That makes us feel smart in a way, but it reduces the suspense of the action sequences. There's only real drama if there is a genuine possibility that the protagonist will not survive it. That doesn't mean the drama is real if the odds are stacked absurdly against a character, as often happens. It means that the world that is created by the movie gives the audience the impression that this is the kind of story that is willing to kill its main characters or at least wound them beyond repair. This is not the case in the Fast and Furious movies, and it reduces the excitement of their many action scenes.I'm sorry if I ranted too much here. I just have some strong opinions on the choices that this movie made. It does have some redeeming qualities in its frequent funny moments and slightly emotional subplots. But for the most part it's just a testosterone-driven movie with an adequate story pasted onto it. Overall Rating: 6.1/10",Fast Five
111,funtasticfour,Still my second favourite of all of them,9,10 July 2019,"My favourite is still the first movie, because there would be no others without it. Part 2 is good, Tokyo Drift is ok, and part 4 is the most forgettable. So the series was going downhill fast, but came way back up for this one. I originally saw it in Imax which is the best way to see it with the scenery of Rio. Awesome action, crazy car scenes and a vigorous shot of adrenaline from The Rock that really helped out the series.",Fast Five
112,willcundallreview,We finally get good five in,7,16 October 2015,"Five films in and at first it feels like yet again we are in for the same old Fast and Furious, races galore and dumb dialogue which makes a movie that could be good, bad. Something has happened though because Fast Five is actually a good movie and I really mean that, not only is the plot exciting and full of action packed and well done sequences, it also actually builds the characters so you don't feel they are disposable cast members and sure the film gets rid of races every few minutes but that is where the good stuff lies, the fact that this has very little racing. The movie tries it's hardest to keep the cars cool but then make the story a movie full of guns and full of emotional back stories etc, it partly works and maybe can be a little shaky with those emotional parts but all in all you still feel a slight connection and that is what truly counts in the end.The story takes us to Brazil and the crew of Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker), Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his sister Mia (Jordana Brewster) are as always, in trouble. This time the story takes us in a direction of heists and getting in and out of places fast, sure the stakes are seemingly impossibly high and the police of Rio de Janeiro are very unbelievable but the movie still navigates it's way well and creates a sense of danger at every turn. By far the best addition to the movie is Dwayne Johnson who plays the role of tough US security service agent Luke Hobbs, he literally looks like a human bull at times in this and his character is made out to be a man of the law, but a man who doesn't let anything get in his way. Now Justin Lin for me personally has failed to direct well at all with his previous instalments in the series, here he takes a whole new turn and makes a tip-top piece of work. The movie benefits from the fast pace because it doesn't hang about, the plot isn't maybe the most unique but the development that I feel Lin gives to the characters is good enough for this to really work. Chris Morgan's script is OK I mean at times it gets a little same old but it still manages to bang out a story and some snappy dialogue to make you feel like seeing this through, certainly tries very hard with the one liners in this one. I felt the main cast we know from the past like Paul Walker and Vin Diesel were alright, they were not the reason this movie is good but they do their parts and get them done pretty nicely. We see some other old faces from the past movies and that really plays into the whole story well, sure it is trying a lot to make itself look cool that way but it does work and it is a welcome sight to see some of the faces of old. The setting was a nice choice I have to add, the small cramped housing provides a perfect back drop and interior settings for some of the films biggest moments, a particular part running across the roofs of those buildings is fantastically shot. So a worthy addition to the furious franchise that seems to still be chugging a long, grossing in bucket loads of cash and breaking records at every corner. I hope that we see more of what this film is like in the future of this series, I don't mean go with the heist format again but lose the cars as racing tools and this comes off well, start to inject a little more depth and you have yourself an exciting but emotionally charged movie that not only fans of the series can enjoy, but also those who really do not like the ones that came before this one too.",Fast Five
113,rdoyle29,Grade A junk ... I love it,9,5 September 2017,"The fifth movie in this series is where it really hits its stride. It brings together all the major characters from the first 4 movies into one plot line that largely abandons to street racing angle in favour of a really silly heist plot peppered with several outstanding action sequences. This is a vast improvement because the plot and characters have always been the weak point of this series, so de-emphasizing them in favour of action provides a winning formula. While the action sequences are not exactly realistic, they are grounded in practical stunt work and not a ton of CGI, so they feel more realistic than they have any right to do. This is really top quality junk, and I wish we got more big budget action films like it.",Fast Five

I do like this addition though, never been a fan of The Rock and im still not but it was easy to ignore his scenes.Perfect cast, perfect Movie, can we go faster? Highly recommend!",Fast Five
115,EthanBJones_03,The best in the franchise and its the FIFTH movie. That's impressive; Would Recommend,8,16 May 2017,"Directed by Justin LinStarring Paul Walker, Vin Disel and Dwayne JohnsonPlot Overview: ​Ever since ex-cop Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) and Mia Torretto (Jordana Brewster) broke her brother Dom (Vin Diesel) out of custody, they've traveled border to border to evade authorities. In Rio de Janeiro, they must do one final job before they can gain their freedom for good. Assembling their elite team of car racers, Brian and Dom know they must confront the corrupt businessman who wants them dead, before the federal agent (Dwayne Johnson) on their trail finds them.Very rarely is a sequel better than its predecessor. It's nigh impossible for the third to hold up. The fourth being good is rare. The FIFTH being the BEST is unheard off and is a testament to how enjoyable this movie is. It was birth of a new franchise and set the precedent for how these movies have gone. It has the best acting in the franchise, arguably the best story and is by far the funnest movie in the franchise. The action in this movie is amazing and the finale is just awesome. I definitely recommend you watch this movie; it is awesome.The story was basic but served its purpose. It's a really good heist movie and is stupidly enjoyable. The ending was also amazing and, while it did follow Heist movie clichés, it followed them well and made them work.Paul Walker was alright as Brian O'Connor and Vin Disel, for the first time in his entire career, showed ACTUAL EMOTION in a character. I mean if this movie can do that then that warrants a watch. Jordana Brewster was good as Mia. I don't buy that O'Connor, Torretto and Mia would do what they do. Their motives were pretty weak for the movie. Dwayne Johnson was amazing as Hobbs and revitalised the entire franchise. If you ditched this franchise before this movie, Johnson made this franchise go from 0-60 in less than a second of his performance. Tyrese Gibson was OK as Roman Pierce but he still plays the same annoying character in EVERY SINGLE ONE OF HIS MOVIES!!!! Ludicrous was alright as Tej as was Sung Kang as Han. Gal Gadot was fine as Gisele. Elsa Patansky was also alright as Elena Neves. Something I will say is that while characters like Torretto and Hobbs got plenty of screen time, characters like Han and Tej were left in the dust and had little to no development. I also don't believe that Hobbs would switch sides like that. The villain was also insanely weak and was just terrible.The cinematography was fine and I could actually see which was much better than 4. The effects were also pretty good and blended well with the actual movie. This movie was an all around fun movie and was insanely enjoyable. It needed to improve on its cinematography from 4, which it succeeded but also needed to improve on its villain, which it failed.In conclusion, this movie was so enjoyable and is easily the best movie in the entire franchise. If you haven't seen this movie, I definitely recommend it because it is just great fun.8/10Would Recommend",Fast Five

117,nickmesafilms,Fast Five (2011) - The Biggest Thrill in the Whole Series!,9,7 October 2011,"The fifth installment of the hit ""Fast and the Furious"" franchise, ""Fast Five"", is bigger, better, thrilling, amazing, and it's so entertaining. This story is set in Rio de Janeiro, right after the events of the fourth movie, where Dominic Toretto, Mia Toretto, and Brian O' Connor teams up with everyone from the previous movies, to plan a $100,000,000 heist from the most powerful hit-man in all of Rio, without being caught by Agent Lucas Hobbs. The action is exhilarating, and it kept me on the edge of my seat, wanting for more. The plot is remarkable, and it has a heart of gold contained with drama and action. The cast of Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Jordana Brewster, Tyrese Gibson, ""Ludacris"", and Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, who stole the show for his new performance as Agent Lucas Hobbs, was all quite spectacular, and they brought thrilling and heartwarming characters. Justin Lin was the perfect director to arrange such a movie like this, with all the action, the timing, and the energy. The cinematography and editing is super challenging and enjoying, and the script by Chris Morgan is a heart of gold. The directing is top-notch, the action is exhilarating, the cast is perfect, the plot is excellent, and the finale blends with a perfect notch of surprise. ""Fast Five"" is known as an epic, thrilling, funny, heartwarming, and excellent movie that I was entertained with all that high non-stop thrills and chills. ""Fast Five"", in my review, ""an exhilarating thrill ride, with a story to die for"".",Fast Five
118,dvc5159,Justin Lin and Chris Morgan are just what the franchise needed,6,6 May 2011,"This is the fifth movie in the ""Fast and Furious"" franchise. Fifth. You'd think the franchise would burn out by the third film and drift into direct-to-video territory like so many unfortunate film franchises today (here's looking at you, American Pie), but Fast Five sort of breaks the taboo and proves that, even at the fifth movie, it can still be entertaining and appealing as hell.Sure the acting and screenplay aren't exactly Oscar worthy, but for this genre it does the job great. Vin and Paul, along with many of the reunited cast of the franchise (Matt Schulze, Tyrese, Ludicrous, Sung Kang, Gal Gadot among others) make for a damn good action team, and the nostalgic value of seeing these different sequel's characters teaming up and joking around is one of the best aspects of the film. Oh, that and seeing Dwayne Johnson and Vin Diesel duke it out mano-e-mano, to see who is the better tough guy.Chris Morgan and Justin Lin are to take credit here. The first movie was solid, but light on acting and story. The second movie was just dumb. The third movie in which Lin and Morgan joined in, was a bit dull but still kept some interesting bits. The fourth movie reunited the original cast members but it felt a bit boring due to some story developments, but hey, you can't blame them for trying.This time around, however, Lin and Morgan improved a lot. Morgan tweaks with the sequel, transforming it into a heist film rather than the first and third films which focused on racing, and the second and fourth films which focused on getting a badder criminal. In this sequel the baddie is a corrupt politician/gang leader played by Joaquim de Almeida (Bucho from ""Desperado"") so you know he's going to be a really nasty villain. The characters are now quite fleshed out and interact more with each other, showing a more older and vulnerable side of them since the last time we saw them in previous films.Lin shows off his (improved) knack for action sequences. There are some really good stuff to be seen here, one of which involves a train and the other which involves the near-total destruction of the streets of Rio de Janeiro. What is impressive is that most, if not all of these action sequences are shot live-action as opposed to CGI (I never liked the climax involving CG tunnels in the fourth movie). While there are few racing scenes, the last action set-piece, is truly a sight to behold. It is preposterous, yet utterly exciting and hilarious to watch due to the truly amazing stunt work put together by Lin and crew. I've never seen destruction this frenzied and exciting since James Bond's pleasant tank drive in St. Petersburg in ""GoldenEye"".It has to be said anyway - this is the best of the franchise, hands down. Morgan and Lin took the franchise to a different and quite mature direction, and let's hope the sixth (yes, it was mentioned a week ago) will be as good, if not better, than this one. This is great entertainment and a solid start to the summer.P.S. Stay after the first part of the credits. Trust me.Overall rating: 73/100",Fast Five
119,gary-444,Preposterous Fun,8,31 May 2011,"I viewed this ""blind"" without having seen any of the previous ""Fast & Furious"" offerings. Previously a series which apparently involved car theft and street racing held little appeal . I am pleased to report that my preconceptions were wrong, and I thoroughly enjoyed two hours and twenty minutes of preposterous fun.The moral problem of rooting for robbers is side-stepped by the fact that they are robbing from even badder guys – a drug baron and his cartel. Vin Diesel enjoys himself enormously as the robbers head honcho, Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson enjoys himself even more as Hobbs his special forces nemesis charged with hunting him down.The plot itself is a classic Hollywood formula. The robbers double cross each other, the good guys are sent to catch the bad guys who are out to steal from the even badder guys. The chief good guy hooks up with the prettiest girl, the bad guys come unstuck, but so do the good guys, who then form an understanding to thwart the even badder guys.Director Justin Lin directs with style and brio with car scenes used sparingly, and therefore very effectively, the gaps being filled in with old fashioned heists, rip-offs, foot chases and shoot-outs. Elena Neves as the honest cop is hot and shades Jordana Brewster as the gangsters moll. The Brazilian/ Rio location shots are milked for all they are worth with plenty of swooping over the favelas, Christ the Redeemer ,the Corcovado mountain and the Copacabana.The climax, a raid on a vault is plain silly, but great fun and Paul Walker is excellent throughout playing alongside Vin Diesel. A minor problem is that the normally imposing Diesel is physically dwarfed by Dwayne Johnson who is clearly here to stay for the next instalment. An adrenaline rush from start to finish with blue skies, stunning scenery, pretty girls, muscle bound guys and fast cars , clichéd? Yes. Fun ? Hell, yes too!",Fast Five
120,Jackpollins,When The Rock and Vin Diesel throw down,9,17 May 2011,"When Friday The 13th hit part 5, everyone had one word in mind-pathetic. When Saw hit part 5, only their most loyal fans stayed around. By the time Star Wars: The Phantom Menace (part 5 of the series) came out, everyone was booing. Now, you may ask yourself, what's the point of this little rant? Well, the point is that it's hard to keep a movie going with 4, or hell, even 3 sequels (just look at Scream 4.) That being said, Fast Five is the best in the series. Vin Diese, returns as Dominic, who escaped from jail and is sentenced at the beginning to more jail time. He promptly escapes and teams together a group of cons, thieves, and most importantly, car drivers for one last mission. Also returning are brother and sister Brian and Mia (Paul Walker and Jordana Brewster). All the veterans are really good, and Ludicrous is very funny as Tej, a newcomer who helps the guys out on their last mission, but the scene stealer here is Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson as Luke Hobbs, a cop who always gets his man. He's simultaneously funny and intense, and when him and Diesel throw down, everyone in the theater will be cheering. Fast Five is an exciting mix of action, comedy, and even a bit of drama. See Fast Five on the biggest, loudest, screen possible. It's the start of the summer movie season, and it's looking pretty solid.",Fast Five

123,Meven_Stoffat,The best in the series since the first,5,2 May 2011,"I remember seeing the first one and being wowed by it. I was just a kid, so of course it was something for me. I was 10 and saw it with a few friends and loved it. However I can't recall being impressed with a single sequel since then. Especially the puke fest that was ""Tokyo Drift"". 2 Fast was boring as hell and FAF seemed very slow and unfocused.So I didn't expect much from this movie... and all I can say is WOW.This movie was actually not bad for once. I can't believe for the first time I am able to say I enjoyed a TFATF sequel.The plot isn't anything original or groundbreaking- but the movie is well aware of it, and just piled on the action. That said, even the unoriginality was entertaining- the setting of Rio, a mob boss' money, the robbery of the money, etc.The action is intense and involving- I hated the shaky camera and quick cutting in movies 2-4, so this was much needed. Furthermore, the finale, where two cars transport a bank vault (not ridiculous enough for you?) was incredibly fun, as was the shootout and roof-jumping scene.The humour was evident- the script was like Aaron Sorkin wrote an action movie. I loved the scene where the bomb goes off in the toilet pipes, causing a rain of poop in all the stalls, as was the police car racing scene, etc. Great balance of humour and action.The cast was great too- Vin was his usual cool self, but gotta say, Tyrese Gibson stole the show!!! I loved how he said ""Say What?"" at every impossible situation. The Rock was fantastic as well- I was looking forward to seeing him in it, and he did a fantastic job.My one complaint was that the movie was a smidge too long- maybe 10 minutes should have been trimmed, but ah, what the hell I had fun.You know what... give the crew a cookie, they did a good job with this movie, they made it fun and entertaining, and therefore even if you hate the franchise, it's still good as a standalone movie. Definitely a solid start to the summer movie season!",Fast Five
124,Eternality,Fast Five gives a movie-going experience that alternates between adrenaline-pumping high and dull lows.,7,3 May 2011,"The fifth installment of the popular Fast and Furious series (2001, 2003, 2006, 2009), Fast Five is, as fanboys have claimed, the best of the franchise thus far. I admit I have not seen the prequels prior to this, and even so, I doubt I would be even motivated to consider reviewing them, thus I cannot and will be unlikely to check the legitimacy of those claims. That means this review is purely based on my observations of this film per se, and without any prior knowledge about this franchise nor its characters other than its long-running theme of fast cars, crime, and hot women.Fast Five stars two muscle men in Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson, who in one inevitable and obligatory scene are pitted against each other in an unarmed muscle fight to seewell, who has more muscles. It also stars franchise veteran Paul Walker, and a huge supporting cast of mostly relative unknowns. This gang of characters pulls out a daring heist of a vault containing a hundred million dollars belonging to a corporate- disguised drug lord with ties to the mob and the police. Diesel, who plays Dominic, leads his team in the heist, while Johnson, who plays federal agent Hobbs, chases after them.Directed by Justin Lin, who helmed the third and fourth installments of the series, Fast Five scores highly in its execution of action. Lin shows that he is well-adept at directing car crashes, gunfights, and ka- booms, with the film providing fans with a near orgasmic brand of pedal- flooring excitement. The action scenes are surprisingly clear to see and easy to follow. In fact, they are so well-edited that not only do they generate suspense, but also present a kind of orchestrated sleekness not frequently seen in action movies these days.Some, including myself, would feel that the action is extremely unrealistic in the way it defies the laws of physics. The most obvious example is the entire climactic sequence involving two cars hauling a huge metal vault along the streets at full speed creating havoc that inconceivably does not seem to hurt anyone collaterally. However, it is in the nature of this franchise that action is required (or rather, demanded) to be unrealistic. Lin emphasizes this in the prologue sequence in which a police bus containing prisoners somersaults acrobatically after colliding with a car to the cheers of fans in the theater.Fast Five's story is slightly thicker than a wafer, and is serviceable only to the extent of progressing the plot. Some characters may seem surplus to requirements but they do provide the occasional off-color humorous remark on their present circumstance. In addition to the weak narrative and undeveloped characters, the entire film is not very well- paced, despite the excellent editing of action. Much of the film drags along during times of planning of the heist and the test-driving of real sporty cars. A number of expository scenes could be trimmed to create more urgency; in fact, I feel that this film is a good twenty minutes too long.Fast Five gives a movie-going experience that alternates between adrenaline-pumping high and dull lows. If your diet consists of brainless entertainment, this is your key to salvation. If you are an action fan, this would also be your territory. For those whom are just plain curious like me, I say try it out and judge for yourself.GRADE: C+ (6.5/10 or 3 stars)",Fast Five

128,Bruce722,Great film.,9,6 June 2013,"Fast Five was awesome. It was essentially Fast and the Furious meets Oceans 11 except with more explosions. There wasn't as much car action as there was in the past movies (1 and 3 especially) but that really didn't hurt the movie much. Like the prior installment in the Fast and Furious franchise, this one featured a really good story, impressive action, solid acting, and some unfortunately unrealistic aspects (like determining the identity of someone by using mediocre traffic cameras to read their eyes or face through a mask) that were the only real negatives of the film. Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson was a beast and a great addition to the series and the fight scene between him and Vin Diesel was epic. I wish they would've shown some of the car chases that they left out (Dom and Brian acquiring the Porsche for example) but I suppose they felt the movie was already too long. I also thought the brief cameo in the after-credits scene by two females from movies past was a cool touch but I truly do with they would've ended the story with this film instead of extending out the franchise. Regardless, it was definitely a good movie and most would really enjoy it.",Fast Five

130,colinrgeorge,"Cars, Muscles, and Muscle Cars",6,4 May 2011,"Forgive my ignorance of the ""Fast and Furious"" films. Believe it or not, this fifth installment is the first I've seen in its entirety. I could generally care less about car culture and only just learned how to change my own oil. The closest I come to drifting is in ""Mario Kart."" I am not the target audience. But as the producers have apparently exhausted street racing tropes, they've pimped the franchise out to the masses. Color me impressed, it actually works.""Fast Five"" may be brainless action, but at least it's the type that revels in its own ridiculousness. The genre has lately fallen into a self-serious slump, teeming with stern- faced heroes who don't enjoy saving the world one bit. Conversely and to all appearances, Vin Diesel and company couldn't be having a better time tearing up the streets of Rio de Janeiro. Sometimes a fast car and a toothy grin is all you need.Director Justin Lin obviously appreciates the simple and satisfying marriage of physical stunt work and compelling cinematography. Granted, it's no master's course in action filmmaking, but his use of the camera to transfer momentum is undeniably effective. Particularly impressive are his opening and closing chase sequences, in which he employs CGI sparingly in favor of real vehicles and visceral wrecks. Smartly favored in the trailer, ""Fast Five"" is bookended by an hour of easy escapism.The problem is everything in between. No one was expecting Shakespeare, but Lin and screenwriter Chris Morgan should have at least dog-eared the bit about brevity being the soul of wit. At two hours 10 minutes, ""Fast Five"" is longer than it has any earthly business being. The bloated running time allows for some presumably obligatory street races and more tiresome exposition than you can shake a stick shift at.Hours seem to wither away in a dimly lit garage where story beats are spoon-fed to the audience. Get on with it; ""Fast Five"" is a ""one last job"" heist film with few surprises. Whole swaths of the story could be cut—they exist solely to justify more drag races, fistfights, and shootouts. Morgan also relies on cheap, microwavable drama in his peripheral storytelling: an unexpected pregnancy and leftfield romances add little depth to the proceedings. Having his characters emote plays to nobody's strengths.Thankfully, the charisma of the cast buoys any less than Oscar-worthy performances. Diesel comes off surprisingly empathetic as the muscle-bound mastermind of the hundred million dollar heist. Along the way, he spars with a gargantuan federal agent played by The Rock, and calls in help from a colorful cast of returning characters, including an ex-rival (Paul Walker), his sister (Jordana Brewster), a smooth-talker (Tyrese Gibson), and a safecracker (Ludacris).Despite its lulls, ""Fast Five"" kicks the summer off right. With more judicious pacing, it might have been the perfect Saturday afternoon snack, but junk food necessitates a conservative serving size. Lin's overlong film is fortunately punctuated by the sort of tangible high-octane action that has become a rarity in the age of CGI superpowers and spell craft. Even if you're as unfamiliar with the franchise as I was yesterday, you'll likely find this fifth installment immediately accessible and intermittently fun. Now if you'll excuse me, I have a date with my 2001 automatic transmission Toyota Camry.",Fast Five
131,thekyles99,Ranks up right up there with the first one!,7,29 April 2011,"Wow although being a huge 'mark' for Dwayne Johnson when he portrays The Rock in the WWE i have to say his movies as of late have been nothing less then sucky. Well that all changed tonight due his newest flick Fast Five. Dwayne definitely has stick this action genre and he will be OK in my book. He's cool he's muscular and has all the bows and ribbons of a bonified action star. Pair him up with the likes of Vin Diesel another actor who needs to stick to the action genre and you have what is a little over 2hrs of sheer packed fun. Although not being overly impressed with parts 2-4 this one ranks right up with the original only lacking in car races. Now i said car races not chases and this flick is filled with em. Most of the original regular cast (minus the ones who have been killed off in previous chapters) show up for this instalment and a few from the other sequels such as Tyrese Gibson as Roman Pierce (2fast2 furious) and Tej played by Ludicrous another 2 fast memory of sequels gone past. After reuniting with Vince (played once again by Matt Schulze) who is now living in Rio with his love interest and his child. Its not long before the old team are back at it this time putting their heads together to pull off a which leads to be a 'Ocean's 11' worthy heist of the big political villain who pretty much runs Rio Dejeinero, Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida). Dwayne Johnson, like i said rounds off the cast playing the lead Marshall who has been hired to hunt down and arrest Dominic and his crew. Any fan of this series should really be happy with this latest instalment that really hasn't lost any of its staying power yet in my opinion in fact to the contrary its gained life. I could see them doing more of these.",Fast Five
132,Fields201,Fast Money,8,15 May 2011,"I only seen the first Fast and the Furious and I own it on DVD. I skipped out on the sequels, mostly because of the bad word of mouth. When Fast Five was released, I didn't have intentions on seeing it until I learned that The Rock was in it. However, I wasn't sure if the film would deliver. After some positive word of mouth from several people, I was convinced on seeing it. So on a cold, rainy day and an awful week that had passed me by, I decided to give this movie a spin.And boy was I surprised!Fast Five is one exhilarating movie! It didn't start out well. Without seeing the previous installments, and barely remembering the first, I was a little lost in the beginning. Where things picked up was in the train robbery scene where Vin Diesel and Paul Walker (who's best performance is in Running Scared) are having that fight scene. It was pretty awesome, up until the end but I guess that's where the suspension of disbelief comes into play.The movie doesn't linger onto any dramatic scenes for too long. The filmmakers know that their target audience came for the fast cars and action. Who cares about any subplots and talking? The Rock makes a grand entrance and is provided with enough screen time to make The Rock fans happy. I also like the turn of events with his character near the end. It was handled brilliantly.Speaking of the end, the climax is probably one of the best climaxes I've seen in a very long time. I think it probably nailed the whole summer movie feel. By the end of the movie, I felt that this is what summer movies are meant to be. I don't know if the director Justin Lin saved the franchise, as I don't even know if the franchise was in trouble in the first place. However, this movie might have introduced more fans. With the series being stagnant for so long, I can honestly say that I'll be looking forward to the sixth installment.",Fast Five

Because it's a flagrant waste of fossil fuels for no reason except to watch big shiny loud things zooming around. So, a movie about cars racing around and smashing up in totally pointless ways ought to be a double obscenity.But I digress -- the only reason I rate this as high as 2/10 is that at least it's technically competent. It's just loud and dumb. There are some made-up bad guys and some made-up plot, but these are pretty much just a paper-thin veneer to find 'reasons' for our group of (anti)heros to race around, hide, fight, smash up lots of stuff, and generally just keep your eyes busy for 2 hours that you end up wishing you had back. Worst of all is that at the end, it's all excused with some superficial platitudes about 'family'.If all you want for the price of admission is to check your brains at the door and watch meaningless high-priced stunts with no logical connecting tissue, I guess this will fill the bill.",Fast Five

Vin Diesel and Paul Walker return and are joined by newcomer Dwayne Johnsson for the 5th Fast and Furious Movie, entitled ''Fast Five''. There's not much to say about this, the action movie of the year, except it's fantastic shots of Brazil, the heist plot that brings even more excitem«ent to the table and overall the continuation of the story of these characters we have come to love and support, as their bond streghtens over time.In Conclusion, if you love the franchise then you can't miss it9/10",Fast Five

'Fast Five' is named such because it is the 5th installment of the mega successful Fast & Furious franchise. If you take a look at billion dollar movies and take away comic book movies and James Cameron films about all that's left are Fast & Furious films along with some Disney/Pixar films which is impressive considering its rather humble roots, and you can easily point to this fifth installment where the series changed tactics and became something different, grander in scale and scope. The series always boated a wonderfully diverse cast, but this film gives the misfit street racer family an exotic locale to go with the super charged vehicles and it also assembles the core of what would be the team going forward. From the outset there was Vin Diesel's Dominic Toretto, Paul Walker's Brian O'Connor and Jordana Brewster's Mia Toretto. This cobbled together people who had appeared in other films including Ludacris, Tyrese Gibson and Sung Kang as fan favorite Han. Additionally they added the future Wonder Woman in Gal Gadot and Dwayne Johnson who collectively tripled the sex appeal of the film. To further ramp up the profile of the series instead of dealing with a simple street racer plot they started to vault into international intrigue on the scale of something that James Bond might handle. The crew inadvertently becomes their own version of an Impossible Mission Force.
The show starts off with the crew on the run and Dom in prison. After a high profile escape featuring some pretty slick car work they wind up hiding in Rio de Janeiro which is a wonderful location for shooting due to the gritty yet colorful beauty of their urban sprawl capped by the ever watchful Christ the Redeemer statue and Sugarloaf. The crew not only runs afoul of the local drug kingpin, but also is being hunted by an elite CIA backed bounty squad headed by Johnson's Luke Hobbs. He starts as an attack dog, but by the climax he becomes an ally and would go on to be a legit team member in future installments. There are stories that behind the scenes Diesel and Johnson are often at odds for control over the series. While evading Hobbs the team goes to war against this drug lord that winds up being capped by a ridiculous but adrenaline charged chase scene that becomes an instant classic. It involves two Dodge Chargers pulling a bank vault through the streets of Rio using it as a weapon.
This film is incredibly fun. It consistently reinforces the family theme which comes to be a hallmark for these films. There is not as much racing in this film as they skew away from that deliberately and turn toward more action based set pieces that happen to involve vehicles. As the installments move into the future those action set pieces get more and more eye popping and outlandish so back in 2011 the 'Fast Five' ones are relatively tame considering where they have gone. The direction is frenetic and gorgeous thanks to Justin Lin. The script is well written with good action, tension and humor. The action surely boils over into outlandish territory, but they embrace it so thoroughly that it only adds to the enjoyment of the overall endeavor. The wonderful location, amazing array of actors, slick script and elevated action plot really serve to make 'Fast Five' the pivotal film of this series and a paradigm shift that would serve to launch this film franchise into the stratosphere.

137,cadillac20,The Summer Begins Now!,8,29 April 2011,"Well, color me surprised. The Fast and The Furious has not been a series known for it's intelligence. Indeed, it's always been big, loud, and dumb. The original hit the right notes at the time of its release, appealing to many as a street racing film where few films has treaded before it. However, it's lackluster sequels failed to deliver. With the adrenaline rush of the original over and poor writing and acting all around, the sequels were nothing more than a series of poor imitations that could never recapture the thrills of the first film. So, it's with some surprise that Fast Five is arguably the best film in the series.Fast Five ditches the street racing that made it's name in favor for being a heist film. In this particular case, we pick up right from where we left off, with Dom being busted out of his prison bus. They then flee to Rio where they take on a heist that goes haywire and eventually leads to the penultimate heist of the film. In the meantime, ruthless Agent Hobbs, who specializes in tracking and capturing people, arrives to catch out trio of outlaws. The film does a good job of not wasting any time and most of the serious moments are kept to a minimum in favor of heist scenes or action. And in the action department, the film delivers tenfold. Far bigger, louder, and more exciting than any F&F film before it, action junkies should find themselves thrilled by the impressive set pieces and testosterone-laced mix of car and foot action.Now, don't get me wrong, this is still a F&F film. This means that the script is still pretty laughable and the acting leaves much to be desired. However, with that said, it's still a bit improved here. Vin Diesel still can't play up emotion very well, making his attempts at the more serious scenes here a bit laughable. Paul Walker doesn't fair much better and, unfortunately, even as a main character takes a back seat to Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson. As action stars though, these three do a great job. In particular, the eventual confrontation between Diesel and Johnson is fantastic, with it being a brutal, WWE-esque rumble. The climactic scene alone is worth the price of admission. Though laughable, it's still an exciting, eye-popping scene that will leave you a little stupefied. Certainly, you have to suspend much of your disbelief with your film. If you can't do that, you'll just find this entire film laughable and of poor entertainment value. For those who can though, this is a very entertaining film. And for fans, you'll certainly enjoy the film, with a well rounded cast from throughout the entire series coming together to pull off the impossible. It's definitely surprising to see that the fifth film in the series is the best, but I suppose that it's merely the evolution of F&F. With enough money, talent, and by pulling out all the stops, the franchise has finally capitalized on the over-the-top aspects that they had always seemed to go for. Suffice to say, action fans with enough suspension of disbelief will enjoy this immensely.",Fast Five
138,quinnox-1,Better than expected,7,17 May 2011,"I went into this movie not having seen any of the previous ones, and was pleasantly surprised to find a fairly good action movie. Lots of beautiful exotic sports cars and video game-like stunts using them to make crazy jumps and turns and chases. The shootout scenes weren't half bad either, with people realistically going down after being shot once instead of the usual routine in most action movies where everyone seems to be wearing heavy duty bullet-repellent suits on and it appears to be impossible to hit anyone despite hails of bullets in the air. Though some scenes admittedly do get rather ridiculous, with speeding cars skidding around a heavily populated city and yet everyone seems to get out of the way in time, but oh well. You have to give a certain amount of leeway to a movie like this to enjoy it. Vin Diesel and Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson both turn in their standard tough guy performances, and I don't think fans of either one of them would be disappointed.For a pre-summer season action movie, it could have been a lot worse, and is a fun and light diversion.",Fast Five

By doing so, they hoped to attract wider with car culture and cars being used as a heavy emphasis.The plot follows the events of the last film with Dominic being transported to Lompoc Prison, but eventually is saved by Brian O'Conner and his sister, Mia Toretto as they hid in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. They plan a heist to steal $100 million dollars from corrupt businessman Hernan Reyes while being pursued by arrest US Diplomatic Security Service agent Luke Hobbs.To me, this was the film that transformed this franchise from the underground racing-theme in the previous film to movies that has cars and girls and stuff. This was also the first film that features only one car race and giving more attention to action set pieces such as gun fights, brawls and the heist of $100 million.The action is top-notch with the climactic car chase at the end of the film, which is the best climax in an action / comedy film ever made and created and I give credit to the director and the script writer for doing this.The music by Brian Tyler is just memorable and I'm not going to go into too much detail about his musical score for this film because he's also composed music for the fourth and fifth films in the Final Destination series and he has just finished composing music for the upcoming sequel Avengers: Age of Ultron, which hits theaters worldwide next Friday on May 1st, 2015.Now, I get to the acting. Vin Diesel returns as Dominic Toretto and he is really good. The same can definitely be said for Paul Walker & Jordana Brewster as Brian O'Conner and Mia Toretto. Sung Kang and Gal Gadot as Han Seoul-Oh & Gisele Yashar were wonderfully, especially Gal Gadot, who will be playing Wonder Woman in the upcoming Batman vs. Superman: Dawn of Justice, which is set for release in March of next year.The film sees the return of Matt Schulze as Vince and he does a great job in the screen time that he has until he dies in the film, which is a sad moment. The film would also see the return of Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges as Tej Parker and Tyrese Gibson as Roman Pearce and they do a very great job and the comedy is just funny and the way they talk is just funny and amazing.The film introduces three new characters: Hernan Reyes, the main villain, played by Joaquim de Almeida, who does a very good job, but it took me a couple of re-watches to understand what the heck was saying. The second character introduce is Elena Neves, Hobbs' partner and Dominic's second love interest, played by Chris Hemsworth's wife, Elsa Pataky. She is just cool. Finally, the third character who would be introduced was Luke Hobbs, played by Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson and he performs the role fantastically. The fight between Dominic and Hobbs was fantastic and Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson took that scene really seriously.Overall, I simply love Fast Five. It blends action with comedy so brilliantly and awesome. The drama also works and it is really great.

142,RCWjr,Just keeps getting better,9,29 April 2011,"You know, it is hard to sustain a franchise today through 3 movies, much less 5. But with the FF franchise, not only have the last two films regained the momentum, they have gotten better! The latest entry, FastFive, is unquestionably the best of the franchise to date.FastFive takes the franchise beyond the fast cars and lovely girls genre and has turned itself into a bone-fide action/adventure franchise. There are enough of the fast cars and women elements, but the focus is now on character and story. A far cry from the humble beginnings of the series.We get re-introduced to many friends from the past films and along with that, we get Dewayne Johnson, who comes into the film and chews up the scenery. He and Vin Diesel's confrontation is an action fans dream. And we are not let down.The story follows Dom and Co. directly after he has been sprung from the prison bus that was taking him to jail. We get caught up with where everyone is and are introduced to Johnson's FBI agent character. From there we are with the gang as they come to the realization that only through a big score can they truly get free of their pursuer and get to a country with no extradition. So they call up some old friends who come in and from minute one, the film switches to another gear and never lets up. Oh by the way, a long with the gang being pursued by the FBI, they have run afoul of the local drug cartel leader. Their plan to escape with loads of cash has Dom and Co. scheming to relief the cartel of their millions through a daring heist. The scenes of the whole gang together remind me of the first film in that there was a sense of family. That was lacking in the last 3 entries and it was a welcome return to see everyone together.The action is the best of the series yet with the vault through the streets being the highlight of the final act. Rio was a great place to take the series.Performances are all solid here, Diesel and Walker actually showing some depth to the characters they are all but totally in command of here. Everyone here is just great, the camaraderie is easy to see and feel and you are literally having fun with seeing the gang back together.By all means, see this in the theater. I did not see the IMAX version, so can't attest to how good it looks there. But by all means, get out and see this.

Here it comes the fifth installment of ""The Fast and the Furious"" (2001) franchise, thiz is actually the bridging story between ""The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift"" (2006) and is a direct connection to the ending scenes of ""Fast & Furious"" (2009), when Dom (Vin Diesel) was sentenced to 25 years in federal prison and Brian's gang (Paul Walker) attempt to free him again. Justin Lin directs thiz sequel with identical pace and tone from previous movies. Just like the previous F & F movies, it's all about high speed car racing, hot sexy babes and some of cat and mouse criminal activities. Well, to tell you the truth, thiz time is more like a heist movie than car race movie. We will find very less of eye-catching race cars, the movie puts aside many glamour factors, to do otherwise they step on the gas pedal to full throttle into pure action. Frankly, I don't know for sure, who are the real ""Fast Five"" in thiz movie. Certainly, the focus is still on two central characters Dom and Brian. The rest are Dom's sister Mia (Jordana Brewster), the big mouth Roman (Tyrese Gibson), the high tech mechanic Tej (Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges), the big muscle Vince (Matt Schulze), the beautiful driver Gal (Gisele Harabo) and the charismatic Sung Kang (Han Lue) from ""The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift"". One thing for sure, there are more than five people. Thiz time they will face a well-matched opponent, the ambitious Federal Agent Luke Hobbs who is presented by Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson! Thiz seems to be a great selection. The Rock delivers a strong and believable tough guy performance, I'm beginning to think thiz WWE's sensation could be a great serious Actor as well. On the other hand, Vin Diesel performs one round of WWE's wrestling scene with The Rock. It's pretty entertaining to see two giant muscles brutally clash with each other in bare hand fight. Thiz time it comes to my mind, if Vin Diesel would also be one hell of great wrestler in WWE's ring? With all the hype and enthusiasm around, thiz is clearly not the last F & F movie to be made, they will be back to do their things again. Thiz implicit confirmation is exposed in one of Hobb's famous lines, ""We'll find 'em, we take 'em as a team and we bring 'em back.

The plot is sketchy as hell and the pace is way too fast - you can hold a frame for more than a few seconds can't you? Furthermore all the men are constantly covered, and a lot of the time dripping of sweat. They are unsaved and rugged as hell. The women on the other hand are all 10's, though the poor souls seem to be suffering from anorexia and bulimia at the same time - and unlike the guys they are basically always clean and in full make-up. Basically every male teenagers dream. In fact I'd probably have loved it if I was 13. And you know what - despite all the ridiculousness and the extreme cheese factor it's actually quite fun.It's definitely a step down from the last flick, which actually managed to have a good plot and above passable acting - this seemed like an extreme rush job. ""Run over there, say your lines, and look cool - there will be NO retakes!!! - We need the money for special effects"" - is what I imagine must have been said quite often on this set. I'll give you one thing, it will make one heck of a video game - and damn did they manage to squeeze a lot into 130 mins - no clue why they cared to make it this long - but who cares.I can't really give it a bad rating.

It is exactly what I expect from the Fast and Furious movies, and they did it better than ever in this one. Another thing I liked was how they decided to make the theme of this movie a heist.

147,mitchell5954,The Best Fast and Furious Film,8,17 August 2019,"Fast Five is without a doubt the best film is the Fast franchise. I enjoyed the Fast and The Furious as a popcorn film. I did not care for either 2 Fast 2 Furious or Tokyo Drift. I thought Fast and Furious was a step up from the previous films. However, Fast Five is on a whole other level. I enjoy Furious 6 the most, but Fast Five is a better film.The characters are the best aspect about the film. Vin Diesel and Paul Walker reprise their roles here. I think they turn their best performances here. Jordana Brewster returns as Mia. She does a good job with what she is given. The Rock (Dwayne Johnson) gives his best performance in a long time in this movie. To me this is the Rock's return to action movies not Faster.
All the other cast members from the previous films return here. Tyrese Gibson comes back as Roman Pierce. I did not care for Gibson in 2 Fast 2 Furious, but I do not mind him here as much. This is probably because he is a supporting character in this film, and not a main character that has to carry the film. Ludacris (Tej) and Sung Kang (Han) return as well. I never cared about those characters but they did fine in this movie. Gisele, played by Gal Gadot comes back too. She had a small role in Fast and Furious that is not even worth noting. However, I thought her character was awesome here. The character of Vincent is back from the first movie as well. I did not like his character at all in Fast and the Furious, and I did not care for him here either. He is one of the only characters that I did not like in this film. I loved seeing the cast of all the Fast films together. The interacting they all have with each other is great and very fun.The villain, I will say is weak. That should not be a surprise at this point. The Fast films have always had weak villains. Though, I will, say, this villain is one of the stronger villains of the franchise, though that is not saying that much.The action is top-notch! The action scenes trump anything in the other Fast films before it. The action is different than the other films too. It focuses less on races (though there are some) and more on fist fight, fire fights, car chases, etc. This film is more of a heist movie than a racing movie. The effects for the film are also top of the line, and better than all of the other movies. The ending scene alone is worth seeing the movie for.Overall this is a must watch for all who are fans of this franchise. This is easily the best Fast film in almost every category whether it is characters, story, action, effects, etc. It's not Oscar material, but, as far as action films go, it's one of the best of the past decade; maybe two.",Fast Five
148,evan_harvey,"Pretty average, shallow story, what else did I expect?",4,27 May 2011,"Fast and Furios has been going for a while now and while no one pretends that they're great works of art, for however many millions it cost, a blind, gimp monkey could do a better job. This particular installment seems particularly dull, however. The plot is pretty stupid, the one moral character in the story throws away everything she believes in and even the Rock can't help this dismal outing. Here's the lowdown:Plot: *Some* cars (not as many as you'd like), a harebrained plot to rip off a drug dealer (al a Ocean's Eleven) and the Rock busting some pretty weak moves not seen since his WWE days. Some really dumb drag racing in police cars because I think the director realised that there isn't too much actual racing in this film. And that's really the let-down: they've eschewed the only good thing about the series (the cars) and replaced it was a dumb and unoriginal heist plot. The timeline is also skewed. This one fits in before Tokyo Drift, but I'm not sure where in relation to #4 (presumably afterwards).Script: Poorly written. The characters don't do anything particularly stupid (they don't do anything particularly good either), but they waste a lot of time. For instance, they try to come up with a scheme to break in (I won't say where) which involves trying to drift around some corners, and then just abandon the idea when it gets too hard. WTF? It's substandard writing.SFX: Not too bad, but nothing really spectacular.Characters: Meh.Overall, it's pretty weak. This film feels like it had a low budget, and tries to pretend it really had more money than it did. The first Fast and Furious was actually okay, mostly because it had neat cars and a reasonable plot (even if it wasn't done very well). The next one was pretty crap. Tokyo Drift was likewise crap, but I actually didn't mind it. Then number 4 was average with a really dumb plot and lost the hottest chick in the series, and now Fast 5 continues that. At least it's consistent.Anyone who tells you that they're supposed to be like this, they are what they are etc etc, is retarded. In reality, good films actually have decent plots, nice cinematography and well-written characters. A movie about cars can have a reasonable story (it's not that hard) and be well acted.

Once they find a job and prove unsuccessful in performing it, they are now sought by a drug kingpin and faux philanthropist who contracted them in the first place.Rather than knuckle under or retreat, the trio decides to bankrupt their unscrupulous foe, and thereby render him powerless. For this they need help and that is the reason they bring any living associates they from the previous films that played a significant role. All the while their nemesis has informed the American authorities as to their location in an effort to spoil their plans. Enter The Rock, playing U.S. Marshal Luke Hobbs, with the unflinching assistance of the Rio police, who are paid agents of the aforementioned kingpin. In addition, Hobbs has a very rigid view of his responsibility for the larger portion of the film. Fast Five isn't anything its predecessors weren't. Save for a little misdirection at the end.

151,StonedMagician,Great: 9.0,9,26 July 2019,"The Fast and the Furious series has, both to its credit and detriment, always stuck to its guns. The series has always been about one thing: racing fast cars driven by faster women (or is it the other way around?). This approach worked for the first movie because it was a different approach to the action genre, a B-movie exploitation thriller wrapped up in an A-movie shell of well-known actors and colorful special effects. After four of these movies, however, I don't think anyone will disagree when I say that the formula got more than a little old, culminating in the frankly dreadful Fast and Furious. Well, no longer. With series newcomer Dwayne Johnson, Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, and director Justin Lin leading the pack, the series has been transformed beyond the scope of its ancestry and into the strange new world of the B-movie thriller. One of the main problems with the franchise is that they all took themselves too seriously, always refusing to let themselves go, and thus remaining chained to what had gotten the series moving in the first place. Fast Five makes the long-overdue decision to drop over the edge, and emerges as the first truly great entry of the series, surpassing even the original in terms of sheer filmmaking quality. Justin Lin has some serious balls to change what had kept series diehards coming back. There is only one race scene, one. There are quite a few fight scenes to replace the racing, though, and these are pulled of in a gloriously over-the-top manner matched only by the Grindhouse films begun by Robert Rodriguez. Like those films (and unlike Fast 2-4), Fast Five fully embraces its ridiculousness and just runs with it. There are far more practical, realistic ways to do just about everything in this film. It would, of course, be more realistic to stop, then board, the bus carrying Dominic Toretto rather than somehow managing to make it flip by touching a 1970 Dodge Charger. Would it be as entertaining? No, probably not. There are many such scenes in this movie. It would take too long to go into detail on them, but suffice it to say, there are more than enough of them to make this film far and away the most entertaining of the series, as well as the funniest. Part of the fun of this movie comes from the so-bad-it's-goodness of the dialogue and stunts. Dwayne ""the Rock"" Johnson and Vin Diesel create a singularity of testosterone that makes any scene with them together an unmissable spectacle. And Johnson...is...good. For one of the first times in cinema history, The Rock fits into his role, and becomes a truly screen dominating figure. Unlike most action movies these days, this film focuses on the characters just as much as special effects, and makes you lean forward in your seat as they get closer to death, as opposed to sitting back to enjoy the pretty lights. This movie seems so overjoyed to be free that it seems to be too much of a B-movie at times. There are musical notes that rise to a fever pitch just before lines are spoken, there are Mexican standoffs aplenty, and the dialogue itself is entirely too cliched at times (""We need to assemble a team""). But this adds to the humorous side of the film, making for a multitude of genuine laugh-out-loud moments that help break up the intense action scenes. Between the dialogue and the explosions, the movie is paced extremely well, and never once will you be bored enough to turn your eyes from the screen, and if you do do this, then you're probably in the throes of mirth by that point. Besides the gonzo action sequences, this films draw is the actors, as almost every major character from the past F&F film makes an appearance here. The stars fit into their roles quite well, with each one adding their own special touch to a scene, be it a joke, quip, or intimidating glare. Overall, these characters seem more human than they did in the previous films, and this helps you get investing in their conversations and actually wanting to hear what they have to say, rather than just tuning it out, waiting for the next punch to be thrown or fireball to be ignited. This is the perfect film to open the summer floodgates with, and should not be disregarded solely on the basis of its less-than-impressive siblings.",Fast Five
152,edwbur,5 times better than all the others,10,1 May 2011,"this movie is no doubt the best fast and furious out of the whole series. its also longer out of them all. two hours and ten minutes. which got me worried at first. i thought it would drag on to much. but it didn't. they knew how to make this movie good. in this movie they brought back stars from the previous fast and furious films. and added a new main character. they brought back tyrese Gibson from 2 fast 2 furious, sung kang form fast and furious Tokyo drift, ludicrous from 2 fast 2 furious, gal gadot from fast and furious and of course the originals Vin diesel Paul walker and Jordana Brewster. since Brian went on to Dom's team they need a new cop. thats were Dwayne Johnson comes in. he plays Luke Hobbs, a bounty hunter looking for Dom and his team. Dwayne Johnson's character is completely different from Paul walkers character. Luke Hobbs is buff, tough, sense of humor is somewhat lacking, and can fight. since Vin diesel and Dwayne Johnson are in the same movie, there's got to be a fight. which there was. Hobbs vs. Dom. this is the first time someone is equally matched to Dom. and the fight was amazing. there were the hot babes to. the only thing i don't like is that there was only one race in the movie. they used cars just no for racing. but the race has the stars racing against each other for fun. it has comedy, drama, romance, mystery, suspense, and brings thrills all the way through. no doubt see it",Fast Five
153,jonnyhavey,Entertainment: Ego Driven Car Races,7,3 May 2011,"Ten years after the inception of the fast car action film phenomenon, Fast Five takes the U.S. box office by storm beginning summer early this year. Director Justin Lin (""Anapolis"") achieves an opening box office numbers north of 80 mil by amassing all of the franchise's most badass stars including Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Jordana Brewster, Tyrese Gibson, Ludicrous, Sung Kang, Matt Schulze along with adding the brute power of Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson. As expected, there is no plot or character development what so ever, immediately throwing the audience into the escape of Dominic ""Dom"" Toretto (Diesel) sentenced to twenty-five years in prison, facilitated by ex-cop Brian O'Connor (Walker) and Mia Toretto (Brewster). Following Dom's escape, Brian and Mia seek the help of an old friend, Vincent (Schulze), in Rio de Janeiro undertaking a job to steal three cars from a moving train as they wait for Dom's arrival. The heist goes amiss, however, they learn two things, first, they cannot trust anyone and second this is just the tip of the iceberg of the ticket to their freedom. Dom, Brian and Mia commence the biggest robbery the series has ever seen with a 100 million dollar target from the most corrupt and powerful man in Rio, Hernan Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida). Needless to say, they call Roman Pearce (Gibson), Tej (Ludacris), Han (Sung Kang) among other franchise favorites to evade the clutches of Reyes and U.S. federal agent Luke Hobbs (Johnson).Not many sequels stand up to their first installments, however, after four semi-entertaining sexy action thrillers struggling to create a worthwhile plot, ""Fast Five"" does more than equivocating its predecessors. The film's over the top ridiculous scope leaves very little room for slow boring moments. Instead it is full of pointless action scenes including a five-minute foreseeable faceoff between Diesel and Johnson. The battle of the brawny is accompanied by the battle of the sexy between Jordana Brewster and newcomer Elsa Patakay (local Rio cop Elema Neves). And yes there are ego driven car races.The same reasons that make ""Fast Five"" better than its predecessors make the film the true mess that it is. A completely flawed grandiose plot combined with ridiculously bad acting and Tyrese Gibson's cliché one-liners and Johnson's childish clever phrases such as ""Now give me the veggies"" make the script seem like something a 13 year old thought up while playing Need For Speed with his friends. However, by disregarding plot development and clever writing, ""Fast Five"" has broken through the bonds that have always been holding the series back.In the end, nothing stands in the films way as the writers completely shirk their job letting the cast loose through a labyrinth of explosive fun. All that matters is that ""Fast Five"" is the epitome of a Hollywood moneymaker. It is entertainment.",Fast Five
154,JamesIan2021,Franchise Turning Point,8,12 May 2015,"Featuring some of the most spectacular and jaw dropping action scenes I've ever seen in a film, this is the definition of action. This is how all the Fast and Furious movies should've been. It was after the first film that the series went downhill, with a poor second movie, an even worse third attempt, but the fourth was good enough setting the bar high enough, although director Justin Lin completely smashes that bar leaving it in the dust. He has totally breathed new life and full on excitement into the franchise. The main issue with the previous movies was the lack of breathtaking action, instead the creators settled on boring characters, corny emotional dialogue and not enough chaos, whereas this fifth movie just excels in everything, both in speed, drama and action. Stunning locations, gorgeous girls, earth-shattering fight sequences and a riveting story that completely knocks the first four films out the water, prepare for the ride of your life with Fast Five. The opening continues where the fourth film finished, and straight after comes the epic train sequence, then a rooftop chase across the maze of shanty town Rio, and thank god Diesel and The Rock fight it out. There are so many memorable scenes and awesome races that you will be spoilt for choice when it comes to trying to pick out your best moment. But, it has to be said, the finale is the one, which is fifteen minutes of action movie perfection with an exciting twist you definitely won't see coming. Must see! Must own! Fast Five is easily the highlight of 2011 for action.",Fast Five
155,montera_iulian,Fast Five deals with troubles of identity and becomes pointless but highly entertaining...,6,29 May 2011,"When I first saw the first movie of this series, I said to myself ""Yes, Julian, good entertainment like never before"". After all these years, Fast Five is promoted as being the last one, the grand finale, the ultimate conclusion to the story of our horse-power rider heroes. Fast Five detach itself from the racing plague and transforms into another heist movie which bring nothing new except a few really entertaining chase scenes. So where to begin? The story starts with the planned break-out of Dominic (Vin Diesel) who was convicted for 25 years in jail. It starts with a ridiculous stunt but I got over it fastly. The group then ends up in Brasil and gets into trouble while trying to steal 3 cars from a moving train. The chase itself, the whole operation is entertaining but impossible, deadly and the last but not the least, hilarious in real life. You get the feeling you're watching scenes from 2012. However, Dom, Brian (Paul Walker), Mia (Jordana Brewster) and Vince (Matt Schulze) deal with real issues after they find out they stole an important cip which was hidden in one of the cars owned by an even more important person in Rio. The most feared and powerful drug dealer, Hernan Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida). Nothing impressive wait? Oh wait. The ""FBI dudes"" from the States sent one of the best teams in Rio to catch them. This elite task is ran by Luke Hobbs (Dwyane Johnson) which is pretty much the old-school, hand-by-hand tough guy. The movie moves pretty fast. We get to find out that Mia is pregnant so of course, Dom and Briand head out for the most clicheic ""last job"" ever. They get to reunite with all their friends from the previous movies, Roman Pearce (Tyrese Gibson), Tej Parker (Ludacris) and Han Lue (Sung Kang). They give green lights for a plan to steal Reyes's drug money. We get the usual guy who wants to get out but once he finds out the kind of money involved he gets back in, we get to see few actual races, some nice beautiful women, big men acting all like a bunch of wrestlers and showing their muscles and we'll even get the bad guy joining the good guys. We're also given, I think, the biggest death toll in this series.As far as their plans, there's no real in-depth look. We're just given small pieces and the rest we must figure for ourselves even some matches don't fit this whole pretentious job. With all the cons we still are entertained and the last part of the movie, the final confrontation actually pays it off even if it gets a little bit cheesy with the sentimental nonsense. As for the acting part, I had one big problem with Dwyane Johnson's delivery. His lines always felt forced like he was reading the script or something. I love The Rock but I still think as an actor... he's still at the beginning.The technical part of the movie is quite impressive. Tough chase scenes, crazy stunts and good fight sequences. I had a problem with some effects like the train wagon explosion. Far from being realistic enough. I also had problems with the lightning and with the continuous and repeating use of wide-city shots between certain scenes. It's the easiest way to make a transition between scenes. It's a cinematographer weakness, especially in a movie like this which has the possibility of looking much much better. The music was pretty good, intense and fitted the atmosphere.Overall, Fast Five was a disappointment as far as a Fast & Furious movie. Fast Five was a disappointment as far as an overall heist movie because of the overused clicheic pieces of story. Fast Five was a disappointment as far as the ridiculous action scenes in it. Despite all that, despite the negative view I have on it I must admit I was entertained. It was a good time. Now, Fast Five deals with troubles of identity. It feels like the last one but it leaves room for another one. And since we already know they'll make another one I have some questions? Why the misleading marketing? Why the misleading point of the movie? Why did they had to make it pointless?",Fast Five
156,blackmambamark,The first sequel in the series that's actually worth your dollar,7,1 May 2011,"Sure the original was something fresh, new, and somewhat original. But the sequels have been anything but. Yeah i know it's high octane fun, but you can say the same thing about Michael Bay films. Am i saying that these sequels are as bad as Michael Bay films? No, but each one offers nothing new, well, unless you count drifting, and that isn't saying a lot. Hopefull this new installment can bring something fresh to the table.I never thought i would say this, but i actually enjoyed this movie. I went in with low expectations, and came out pretty damn satisfied. Sure the movie had a lot of the same moving parts, but what really made this one stand out is how it actually changed the pace of how they normally do things.First, they didn't have a damn drag race every 10 minutes. In fact, they barely had any. Which really is a genius idea, because when the time did come to have an awesome driving sequence, you were begging for it. Finally, someone with brains stepped into this movie and said let's save all of our bullets and unleash them in the end.So with a series that relies heavily on their driving sequences and less on their script, how do you keep your audience entertained? Well, the first step is to incorporate another major actor, enter The Rock. Next, you really need to buff up your script. Okay, here is where it gets both good and bad. It's good because the movie takes a ton of it's credit from the ""Ocean 11"" films. Yeah, it's stealing an idea, but it injecting more action into it, which is pretty cool. But the reason why i say it's also bad, is because it's still packed with bad cheesy one-liners, poor acting, and some really tarnished plot outlines. But does that take anything away from the fun.......not really.Bottom Line, okay people, here is your first action movie worth seeing this year. No, i am not one of those people who hold these 'Fast and Furious' films on a high pedestal. Not since the first one have i given anything over a decent review. But i can say with confidence that this one is actually worth your hard earned dollar. Sure it's slightly cheesy, packed with impossible action, and sure it steals some plot outlines from other films, but i like i said earlier, it's still fun to watch. So with that being said, the question remains.....is this the best one in the series? I still say no, but this movie comes damn close. Closer that any of the other ones, thats for damn sure. On a time line, this should have followed up the original",Fast Five
157,drmuhammedsamiduru,The best in the series,8,22 April 2020,"Fast and Furious Series that brings all the players together. Especially Dwayne Johnson, who came into the film, is one of my favorites. The man is really like steel, the role of the man is integrated into his body.The beginning and end of the movie consists of the most legendary scenes. Especially the initial train scene is legendary. The audience was surprised with the mind games in the scenario in the final money box scene, it was really successful to have such mind games in such an action movie.Also, one of the scenes I liked most in the movie was the part where Spanish and Portuguese people came to Brazil 500 years ago. The message about life there was very meaningful.I wish there would be ten number movies if there were no sexually explicit scenes in such beautiful movies.",Fast Five
158,Tyson14,"The most important thing in life will always be the people in this room right here, right now",10,7 April 2015,"In the first sequence of Fast Five, Brian, (the late great Paul Walker), Mia (jordana Brewster) and a third unknown driver attempt to rescue Dom, who was arrested at the end of Fast and Furious, from a prison bus. To make an cool action set piece short, Brian and Mia flip the damn bus over and get Dom out of it (somehow). I remember when I saw this action sequence for the first time, I realised the absurd hilarity of it all and so I whispered to my closest friend, ""we should try that some time."" My whole group proceeded to laugh at my remark, and then we shared quite a few laughs throughout the rest of the movie. Now, thinking back on that bus flipping moment, I begin to realise that Fast Five might have been that one movie that made me really appreciate fun, mindless action movies.After Brian and Mia manage to get Dom out of police custody, the trio meets up in Rio where they're joined by Vince (Schulze) from the original Fast and the Furious. Vince tells them that they need to steal some cars from a moving train and you bet your ass it's as awesome as it sounds. After a glorious action sequence on board a train, Fast Five introduces Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson, who plays my second favourite character of the franchise here), a Diplomatic Security Service agent who wants to hunt Dom and his crew down and bring them all into custody. Meanwhile, Dom and his team (who I'll call ""Dom's Ten"") create a plan to steal $100 million from a crazy Brazilian guy named Reyes in a much cooler style than Danny Ocean's master plan of stealing millions of dollars from three Las Vegas casinos.Fast Five has, undoubtedly, a story that drives very far away from those original racing roots that the series was known for back in the day. But this is what I ultimately dig about this series: its ability to evolve with each new sequel. There's something oddly glorious about a franchise that used to be about bros and hungry people racing cars transforming into a franchise about those same people attempting to steal $100 million dollars from a vault by dragging the vault out of a building and through the streets of Rio, putting hundreds of people in harm's way.Now that is what I call entertainment!A great addition to Fast Five is Dwayne the Rock Johnson who is one of the most charismatic people on the entire planet. Seriously, you could give that guy a horrible script and he would turn it into gold. With Fast Five, he is given gold and turns it into a damn diamond; the guy is magic. He's one of the few examples (Dave Bautista being a new example) of a wrestler- turned-actor that has actually succeeded as an actor in the long run. With his most recent appearance at WrestleMania 31,Johnson is a figure that can both be a welcomed addition to a movie and then can be welcomed back into the squared circle the very next day. In Fast Five, the Rock steals the show whenever he shows up because he's such a great screen presence. It's almost possible to feel him in the background of each scene (that he's not in), working his way to finding and taking down Dom's Ten.He also gets an awesome fight scene with Vin which is the best fight scene in the franchised only matched by Vin and Jason statham's fight scene in furious 7. Without the Dwayne, I don't think Fast Five would have reached the astronomical heights that it managed to cross.Fast Five bounces around from action scene to action scene and in between these action scenes is where it fuses its great characters into its fairly entertaining story to deliver what I think is one of the most well-rounded packages of the entire franchise; it might even be the most well-rounded (at least so far). I mean, seriously, you got Paul Walker, Vin Diesel, Tyrese, Ludicrous, Jordana Brewster, Sung Kang, Gal Gadot, Tego Calderon, Don Omar, and Dwayne Johnson in the same movie; it's the Expendables of race car action movies. Fast Five also throws in a small bit of genuine emotion in one particular scene and it reminded me that this bonkers franchise is able to actually be sad from time to time. Who would've thunk it?The one thing that has always managed to stick around in my brain since seeing Fast Five for the first time, and what has become my group's tradition since then, is picking characters from the movie that we ""represent"". I, of course, picked Dom because I'm the leader of our group. My closest friend picked Brian, my other friend picked Han because he's cooler than the rest of us, and so on and so forth. Since the Fast and the Furious series has always been about family/friendship, I believe that us choosing the characters like we did gave us a stronger connection to the movie but also a stronger connection to each other; this was the movie that evolved the friendship of my group into a small family that ultimately changed us all forever.There's nothing stronger than the bond of family, and Fast Five really embraces that concept until it runs out of fuel and plummets off a cliff and into the waters below. It is also a life-changing movie and a damn fine example of how to mix action, characters, and emotion into one rollicking good package.",Fast Five
159,dineshaishu,Fast five,9,29 July 2019,"Now when a long running series like The Fast And The Furious get sequels it is always a challenge to go out and try impress movie goers.However the series always tops itself with the recent sequels and Fast Five proof that's anything is possible with the right minds.The plot this time take place after Fast and Furious 4 left all with Brian O'Conner played by Paul Walker, Dominic Teretto Played by Vin Diesel, Mia Toretto played by Jordana Brewster head for Brazil to escape the law after a job with Vince Played by Matt Schulze went wrong.Which leads to them being hunted by Luke Hobbs Played by Dwayne Johnson who along with Elena Played by Elsa Pataky begin to hunt them down.Also returning are Roman Played by Tyrese Gibson, Tej Played by Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges, Han Played by Sung Kang, Gisele played by Gal Gadot.Reyes Played by Joaquim de Almeida who serves as the Film Main Antagonist.Story wise the plot is very good because it features the return of many of the characters from the series which is very good and moves the series along. Plus the film requires you to pay attention or you'll miss something. Plus you see the characters grow in this film from the last films.What drives the film like the other films is that the stunts from start to finish that defines The Laws of Physic and why I love this series because the cast and crew are always driven to push the limits and hold nothing back, Fast Five is the example of it.There is just a lot for this film that I recommend seeing for yourself where you'll be amazed and how you can do a sequel with the right minds.With awesome stunts, great action and plot you'll be glad you watch this film.",Fast Five
160,byrann_gowan,Best Fast and Furious movie of the series!,8,18 August 2018,"I gotta say that, every time I watch this movie, I get excited because it is so much fun to watch. That's the thing about these movies; they may be ridiculous, but they are soooooooo much fun! It is clear that everybody on this film had an absolute blast and I loved every minute of it!With that being said, the thing that I like about the series now is that it isn't just focused on the cars. I feel like the earlier installments, while still fun, were somewhat all style and no substance. Yes, I know that I'm talking about the Fast and the Furious movies, but it felt like this one had an actual plot outside of fast cars racing down the street. It was entertaining; it wasn't just nice looking.As said before, the actors all had a lot of fun with this movie. Vin Diesel and Paul Walker, of course, are the guys that heads the crew, while the rest of the crew are their usual, wisecracking and fun-loving selves. I particularly enjoyed seeing Gal Gadot pre-Wonder Woman. This time, they are joined by one of the most entertaining people in the acting business, Dwayne Johnson. Johnson was made for a series like this, and he gives it all he's got in a various amount of action set pieces.My one complaint is that the villain felt a little one-note. I didn't feel like there was any motivation for him, other than revenge. But, that is only a minor complaint, as the film itself was great!Definite recommend!",Fast Five

This movie was one of those, ""stop making these"" movies. The actions scenes in these movies were less believable than Die hard or Charlie's Angels full throttle. The writing and directing tried to make a super movie by bringing everyone back from the first and second to play in this movie.

162,arnieiam,There we go,10,6 May 2011,"So I went to watch Thor today and it was OK but then right after I went into another screen where Fast Five was playing and then thats when I felt like I paid to watch a movie.Let me quickly go through the first four films. The Fast and The Furious introduced the idea of an action film that can be done with cars readily available on the streets like the Mitsubishi Eclipse or Honda Civic. 2 Fast 2 Furious introduced the repeated villain in the franchise which is the powerful drug-lord. Fast and Furious brought in the crazy action but somehow wasn't able to expand its potential. Tokyo Drift was a complete abomination and felt completely unnecessary.Fast Five really seals in the gaps and blends all the best elements from the previous 3 (I will not include Tokyo Drift in this!!!) and wow, its a great theatrical experience.Rio was used as a setting and even though that's becoming a little played out, it's still brilliant because it allows for brilliant action sequences. Whether it's a rooftop chase in the favela, a motorcade ambush by a favela gang or an intense high speed chase sequence with two cars hauling a vault (you saw that in the trailer no big spoiler).Overall everything is so much better, character development, plot lines and story lines, action sequences and even emotion. It does go Hollywood though meaning there is a good amount of suspension of disbelief.I loved it, its good not only as a Fast and Furious film but as a film in its own merit. It took 4 films before but it finally hit the mark.",Fast Five
163,ThatMonkey,"Not As Fast, But Five Time The Fury.",8,30 April 2011,"Short of the last installment of this franchise I have been pretty satisfied. I enjoyed the sequel. I think the combination of J Singleton and Tyrese made for a humorous follow up, but I think it was a little too chocolate for a vanilla audience. I was reluctant to see Tokyo Drift and mostly because of the Bow Wow factor, but it was a really good film, much in the spirit of The Karate Kid going to Japan. No, not the weak one with Jaden Smith the original and only Karate Kid in my book Machio! This time around, Fast 5 grabs you by the tailpipe and delivers a supercharged, high octane blast that Detroit never saw coming. We finally find out why Vinnie's last name is Deisel. The movie was riddled with a lot of bad one liners, but the action is so rough rugged and raw, you can overlook the fact that these guys are too old to be living life one quarter mile at a time. The Rock is a menace and from an action sense steals the show. Paul Walker further proves that he was never qualified or even capable to have been a federal agent, but is perfect of the do anything for a buddy, pop the e-brake kinda cat.It might sounds like I'm not a fan, but I think with a few tweaks this could have been great instead of really good. If you are expecting over tuned cars with all kinda of tricked out features, this series has matured and it's more about the story than it is the accessories. It's had to talk much about the film without revealing twists and spoilers so stay through the credits for another 2 piece combo that will leave you saying ""Keyser Soze""!

164,ryanskywalker-87402,Remember to wear your seat belts for this one!,8,18 April 2017,"The fifth installment in The Fast and the Furious franchise, Fast Five is an intensely gripping, thoroughly engaging & relentlessly entertaining sequel that not just brings several upgrades in all departments of filmmaking but by replacing the street racing formula with elements of a heist thriller, it ends up resurrecting this derailed franchise in style and heralds the series' heading into a new direction.Set in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, the story of Fast Five follows Dominic Toretto, Brian O'Conner & Mia as they plan a massive heist to steal $100 million in cash from a ruthless drug lord & corrupt businessman and enlist the help of former allies to pull off the job which would buy them their freedom. But at the same time, they find themselves being pursued by a federal agent who's in Rio to arrest both Dom & Brian.Directed by Justin Lin, Fast Five presents the director in much different form as his kinetic work behind the camera keeps the story running on top-gear from start to finish, and the earlier momentum it gained with its explosive opening sequence is never lost. The screenplay at last places more emphasis on its story & characters, adds in a welcome amount of humour and even though the route it takes is new, the old-school formula isn't entirely discarded.The technical aspects exhibit a complete overhaul which is in sync with the transition this franchise itself undergoes through this chapter. Production design team puts up some wonderfully detailed set pieces, Cinematography makes exuberant use of its camera while the applied colour tones are more vivid than before. The events unfolds at breakneck pace, Editing is at its best during the action sequences, and the vehicular carnage it has in store is simply overwhelming.Coming to the performances, Fast Five brings the notable characters from all the previous chapters together under one roof and all of them deliver more confident performances. Vin Diesel & Paul Walker show greater maturity in their respective roles of Dom & Brian but it's the swashbuckling input from Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson that turns out to be the biggest surprise of them all. It's not difficult to assess that he was really enjoying his character and it reflects in his impressive performance.Last but not the least is Brian Tyler's score which packs in some intense, vibrant tracks that never allows the film's charged atmosphere to settle down and actually enhances the whole experience by a considerable margin. The visual effects team also brings its A- game, for the moments of action seem convincing for the most part, even if it's a tad over-the-top on few occasions. There are more thrilling moments to be found here than in all previous chapters combined and every moment featuring Johnson & Diesel together is a highlight, right away.On an overall scale, Fast Five is without a shadow of a doubt the finest chapter in The Fast and the Furious franchise and the first one in the series that manages to find a near-perfect balance between its elements of style & substance. High-octane, full- throttled & immensely satisfying, Fast Five is an action-packed, roller-coaster ride that packs in all the ingredients in just the right dosages to succeed as a genuine summer blockbuster material & a quality entertainer for not just the fans of the series, but newcomers as well. Absolutely worth your time & money.",Fast Five
165,jcallows,Vin Diesel does The Italian Job,8,10 October 2011,"This is the best film in the series, probably because it borrowed heavily from the recent version of The Italian Job. It borrowed ideas such as deciding to use a fast, nimble car to navigate through a narrow parking garage, creating a copy of the target location in which to practice, obtaining the same safe they will need to crack later, and using street cameras to direct cars through traffic. All of these elements were used in The Italian Job. Oddly enough, rumors had it that a sequel to The Italian Job was going to be made and be set in Brazil but it was never made. Was this supposed to be that sequel? Probably not. A sequel would've had new ideas and this one just had a rehash of old ones.Anyway, despite similarities to The Italian Job, this film was entertaining and enjoyable to watch.",Fast Five

Cars, hot girls, a decent plot, loads of action and an explosive ending that marks the beginning of another sequel. The person that thought of confronting Vin Diesel and The Rock is a mastermind, and just for the brilliance of the idea should be awarded with an Oscar. The testosterone level was, at points, so high that I was literally shouting and cheering at the TV set. Emotions are also well incorporated so the movie has depth. The characters are, even though there is a whole bunch of them (the entire FF crew from every movie in the franchise), well described, complex, and interesting. I was a little afraid that there would be too much of them at once, but boy was I wrong! Every character has it's own story told from the beginning 'till the end. The music was nicely picked but, in my opinion, there could have been a little more metal or rock (Sepultura would have been a good choice since the movie is made in Brasil). The thing that shook me entirely was the ending. The photo that Eva presents to The Rock is so shocking that I couldn't have believed my eyes! And I must say, not many movies in the last few years managed to create that sort of feeling in me. There is only one problem with the movie: it ends. Get your crew, grab as much popcorn and sodas as you can and have a blast.",Fast Five

169,TamPalm,Decent...but,6,10 June 2011,"I don't know all the backstory of this franchise, but I enjoyed this movie for the most part. It was action-packed and visually enticing. I am not a guy, but if I was, I think I'd know this movie is tailor-made for me: filled with bravado and a cameraman who apparently can't take his lens of the eye candy and cheesy little one-liners parsed throughout here and there. This is a film tailor-made for the ""Fast and Furious"" fan.But while the action and cinematography is appealing and exciting, some areas left a little bit to be desired. I thought the plot was a little weak and convoluted. I found some of the acting to need a little improvement--the cheesy one-liners didn't help. Most of all though, the cheesy romantic components were just sad. If Diesel and the cop had one more long stare at each other, I might have hurled right there in the theater. And the way all the relationships came together at the end and pretty much everyone got their fantastical happy ending was just a bit much and over-the-top cliché. I was actually surprised at how cliché it all was. The over-the-top happy endings left me wondering where this franchise will go from here, if there is a plan for its continuation at all. There are no holes left. How will the next installment come in with all the characters rich and free and in love and whatnot? Hmmm But let not the previous paragraph deter you. This is a fun film worth seeing.",Fast Five
170,iReviewFilms,Fanaticalaboutfilms Review: Fast Five,7,29 April 2011,"The latest in the Fast and Furious franchise has recently hit the screens and what with the others being a good way to spend a few hours I was hoping for a similar type of movie from this one with plenty of great cars and car chases to boot.Set after Fast & Furious (No. 4) but before The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (No. 3), this time the action is played out in Rio, Brazil after Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) has escaped from police custody in the US with help from his old pal Brian (Paul Walker) and sister Mia (Jordana Brewster) and gone into hiding. With them needing money to disappear forever, Dom hatches a plan to steal all the money from Rio's most reputable underworld kingpin Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida).At the same time they are being hunted down by the elite federal agent Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) and his team who are trying to capture and take him back to prison. Although it is quite possible to watch this movie without seeing the previous 4 there will be some parts that may slip you by as the writers have assumed that, if your coming to see this movie then there is a very strong possibility you have seen at least a couple of the prequels/sequel.One thing that I was quite surprised about was the lack of actual cars in the storyline. Sure they were involved slightly more than a normal action movie but I was expecting a lot more. There were probably only 2/3 scenes involving racing or car stunts and when the whole movie is supposed to be based around cars I was expecting just that little bit more. If fact in one scene just when you are expecting a good old fashioned drag race, they cut away to reveal the car back in the garage and already won! The action does make up for this though and is fast flowing throughout as they jump from one explosion/fight scene to the next. The casting of Johnson as the bad-ass agent was a stroke of genius with him bringing his former WWE smack talk to the character. He really makes you want to hate him and I especially enjoyed the Johnson Vs. Diesel fight scene as the 2 heavyweights traded blows.At over 2 hours this is by far the longest in the franchise and although in general the time will pass quickly, they could have easily chopped off a few minutes here and there to stop the risk of it dragging for some people. The acting and script is nothing special and you will have to sit through a fair bit of 'we're doing this for family' talk but that is not what people will come to watch this movie for.With Neal H. Moritz announcing in March the development of a sixth and seventh movie for the series it is doubtful that this surprisingly long lasting franchise will go away quietly. Despite having lots of good action and successfully filling a void in my day, lets just hope that they return to the core basics for the next one rather than forgetting the main reason for these movies was supposed to be the cars.For further reviews feel free to check out: http://www.fanaticalaboutfilms.com",Fast Five
171,Hellrazr360,Fun Film For Fans of Fast & Furious Franchise,7,14 May 2011,"Film series as of recent have been holding a better streak of adequate consistency than we might be accustomed to. Saw didn't start becoming rotten until the fourth installment and while the upcoming Pirates of the Caribbean film might not leave much of a strong impression, early reviews are indicating it'll likely be about as good as Dead Man's Chest (decent). Now we have the Fast and Furious franchise coming back with a fifth installment (and a sixth already in-development). Though the shameful 2 Fast 2 Furious might have been a poor addition, the remaining films have maintained an adequate level of execution and entertainment (peaking with the under-appreciated Tokyo Drift). And with Fast Five being the first of many guaranteed action blockbuster films for the summer, eyes have still been on it to deliver.What has to be made clear is that anyone who honestly wants to enjoy the film should leave their logic and standards at the concession stand. Because from the opening minute alone we're given a scene that defies all plausibility, and the things only continue down a similar road throughout. Now that this has been made clear, the skeptical shouldn't worry too much, for there's still a solid film to find here. Part of what helps Fast Five work as well as it does is thanks to the fact it embraces such an over-the-top nature that audiences are likely more willing to accept given the hardships of today's economy. If you've come to enjoy the crazy action characteristic of series such as Rambo and Die Hard, then you'll feel right at home here.Those who've followed the Fast and Furious films up to this point will probably get a fair amount of nostalgia throughout the film with various characters coming back, including a couple surprises not shown in trailers (one of whom audiences will want to stick around after the short credits, along with another curious surprise). As a result, long-time fans will get the most out of Fast Five. But this isn't to say that newcomers won't feel some sort of attachment (if not entirely to the characters). Since the return of various characters isn't relied on too heavily with regards to exposure, less-familiar viewers needn't worry about feeling lost or not getting an idea of what they're like throughout the runtime. Fast Five might not significantly raise the standards that we've come to expect from such a franchise, but it doesn't have to. With so many areas visited by previous installments, resorting to a more action/thriller-centered approach than even the previous film only seems like an inevitable and fitting road to travel. And you know what? The results are quite welcome and pleasing.P.S. Don't mind my alliteration-heavy summary.",Fast Five

176,TheUnseenMovieLover,A Fantastic Summer Thrill Ride,8,27 April 2011,"Personally, I have never been a huge fan of the Fast and the Furious franchise. The first film was a fun piece of dumb popcorn entertainment, bolstered by strong action, some awesome stunts and Vin Diesel's intimidating presence. Then Diesel vanished, and the series took a downward dive in ""quality"". I really disliked 2 Fast 2 Furious, and I hated the third instalment, Tokyo Drift. Diesel's return in the fourth film, Fast and Furious, signalled a definite improvement over 2 and 3, but still didn't match the original. So it's fair to say that I went into Fast Five with mixed expectations. And I'm pleased to say that I came out with a smile on my face.The plot for this one goes a little something like this. Picking up from the ending of the last film. Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) and Mia Torretto (Jordana Brewster) free Dom Torretto (Diesel) from the transport taking him to prison. Next time we see them, they're hiding out in Rio. However, when a job goes badly wrong, they find themselves being hunted by corrupt businessman Herman Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida). To get both payback and freedom, they call on other characters from the series (Roman Pearce (Tyrese Gibson) and Tej (Chris ""Ludicrous"" Bridges) from 2 Fast, Han from Tokyo Drift etc) to help them in a bid to steal of Reyes' money. However, they're also being chased by tough-as-nails Federal Agent Luke Hobbs (Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson), who's never lost a convictSimply put, Fast Five is a near-perfect piece of summer entertainment. I was hugely surprised by just how pumped up this film left me feeling. I walked out of the cinema feeling energetic and excited, something which I truly didn't expect when I walked into the cinema to watch it. When a summer movie makes me have that kind of reaction to it, I personally think that it has done a great job. When we go to a summer movie, first and foremost we want to be entertained. That is something that Fast Five achieves in spades.That is mostly due to the insane action sequences and stunts in this movie. The stunt team deserve BIG props for some of the things we see on screen here. Right from the get-go, when we see a bus collide with a car and flip while the car is pretty much unscathed, the filmmakers are telling you to leave your brain at the door. If you can do that, the action in here is fantastic. If you're looking forward to some street racing though, you may be disappointed. An early train robbery is brilliantly paced, edited and loud; if you're a fan of the series, the carnage will leave a huge grin on your face. If you're a newcomer, just embrace the absurdity and your grin will be almost as wide. A nicely- done foot chase through the favelas quickly follows, although it does bear unfavourable comparisons to a similar, better executed scene from The Incredible Hulk. But in the final 45 minutes, the filmmakers slam the accelerator on this baby. There's a fist fight between Diesel and Johnson which is worth the ticket price alone, a gunfight which echoes Black Hawk Down and the final, awesomely implausible chase, with two cars dragging a safe (no, I'm not going mad) the size of a wrecking ball through the streets of Rio. It's audacious, spectacular and fun as hell. If you are one of those unstoppable cynics, you will probably walk out at this point, tutting as you go. If you just go for the ride, you'll have a blast. I was personally grinning like the Cheshire Cat. But the most surprising thing for me was how much I enjoyed the scenes between the action set-pieces. Whereas the acting is nothing spectacular, all of the returning actors have settled into their roles by now and have an unforced, easy-going relationship with each other. I actually really liked the good guys in this, and I wanted them to succeed. Tyrese Gibson and Ludicrous, in particular, are hilarious, their rapport with each other and the other members of Dom's crew providing a lot of great laughs throughout. There are a surprising amount of witty, funny one-liners, and most of them go to these two. Walker is decent (if still a bit wooden), and Brewster, as well as being astonishingly beautiful, actually does a effective job of making Mia a vulnerable yet strong character, instead of just window dressing. Diesel, as always, brings his dominant presence to bear; you can immediately sense why the rest of the gang is willing to face these risks for him. As the new villain, de Almeida is suitably slimy and nasty enough to make you want to see the gang beat him. But the big introduction in this movie is obviously that of The Rock. Striding into the movie like a testosterone- driven bloodhound, The Rock puts all of those shameful kid flicks such as The Game Plan and The Tooth Fairy behind him and returns to his masculine roots, sliding effortlessly into the series and delivering a new jolt of life in the process.Overall, Fast Five delivered almost everything I wanted from a summer movie. There are problems; the street racing sequences feel like afterthoughts, the relationship between Dom and a Brazilian cop (Elsa Pataky) isn't developed enough whilst the filmmakers use a few too many panning shots across an otherwise beautiful Rio. But other than that, director Justin Lin, the cast and crew have delivered a hugely entertaining action flick. Based on the mid-credits clip, there might be a sequel. I never thought I'd say this, but if this is one, I will definitely go and see it. Summer is off to a flying start.",Fast Five
177,k-dhesi,"Not only did it suppress the surrounding hype, it kicked, punched, shot and killed the hype.",8,28 April 2011,"I couldn't help but to applaud and cheer after the ending credits among with the rest of the over crowded people in the theatre. It exceeded my every expectation and being a hardcore fan of the fast and furious franchise I couldn't have asked for more from the 5th instalment. It has everything from bone crunching action, combat, shoot em up scenes and of coarse what's fast and furious without the cool dream cars.The gang are finally back together but for this time it's for one last job. The cast is recruited from a range of all the previous fast and furious movies.(1-4) Which was great to see all the characters back together kicking ass. Dwayne Johnson (The Rock) was impressive and my word he gave Vin diesel a tough competition (in the movie as well as their physique!) To be honest I had thought that fast 5 was just going to be a sappy Hollywood attempt just to bring the cash in, well I'll tell you this, the director, the cast and the rest of the crew have smashed the box office and deserve every penny of it. A perfect action/adventure flick for a night out whether your a fast and furious fan or not.After the phenomenal first instalment (the fast and the furious) A mediocre second instalment (2fast and 2furious) A inconvenient, mildly entertaining third instalment (Tokyo Drift) and a decent mildly thrilling fourth instalment (fast and furious) they bring back all the thrills, action, adventure and fun in fast and furious 5 (probably the best one out of the series so far)The 12a (PG-13) rating however did seem a bit dodgy. This film included far to much violence enough for it to easily be a 15 (this would allowed the film to bring slightly more adult themes and violence into the flick too)Don't get it twisted, this film is all Heist and not street racing but when it is as entertaining as this who cares? Thank god they avoided the ""3D era"" which in my opinion would just ruin the film due to the strange camera angles they do purposely to make it feel like it's in front of you. On that note the camera angles were actually really great and noticeable, especially when they show the spectacular RIO. (setting) Fast and furious fans will not be disappointed, especially because it has one of the most bad ass cast ever. The twist was a O.M.G moment so I strongly suggest you wait for after the credits to see this (those of you who have seen it will understand!)Overall I'm completely satisfied with this movie, it's pulled the fast and furious franchise out of the dirt and back into the fun, action-packed adventure that we all love. Take a bow the Fast and Furious crew you killed the hype and by far made the best movie this year so far. Don't miss out on such a exciting adventure and feel how ""fast and furious"" this film really is.",Fast Five
178,markdroulston,Big. Dumb. Awesome.,8,15 June 2011,"There's a scene about half an hour in to Justin Lin's Fast Five, the latest film in the car racing Fast & Furious franchise, where federal agent Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) angrily throws a clipboard to the floor as his explanation of something that ""makes sense"". It's this moment that totally sums up Fast Five: a film you can enjoy only by casting logic aside and simply surrendering to the bombastic absurdity you're witnessing. Luckily for those of us able to do this, the film is one of the best examples of big dumb action of the past decade.This series seems to be on something of a one good/one bad streak, with the first, third, and this fifth film all being worthwhile, somewhat original examples of the big-budget summer blockbuster. Picking up directly where the fourth film (2009's Fast & Furious) left off, no time is wasted in getting to the action, and the opening bus assault places us in familiar territory, setting up the mostly unimportant plot with a spectacular, physics-(not to mention logic) defying stunt to get pulses racing. Where the film departs from the tried and true formula of its predecessors however is in blending the heist film genre with the vehicle-based action, and the decision to shake things up was a smart one. The biggest problem with the previous film was that it just seemed kind of pointless, but here Lin uses the 'one last job' team heist plot as an excuse to reunite characters from every previous entry in the franchise, and indeed the film feels like it belongs more to the Ocean's Eleven canon than Fast & Furious. The series' celebrated 'car porn' is still present, yet Lin wisely opts for more variety than ever before, including more direct character conflict (fighting!), and thrilling parkour-esque foot chases across the rooftops of Rio de Janeiro.While it is fun to see so many previous cast members returning to form the team (similarities with 2010's Inception abound here), undoubtedly the greatest part of Fast Five is the introduction of Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson as Agent Hobbs, a kind of 'super-cop' sent in to nab only the most wanted criminals. Johnson, looking so absurdly massive that he dwarfs even Vin Diesel, adds an extra layer of beefcake to a film already dripping with testosterone, and he seems to be loving every minute. Throwing out hilariously macho one liners (""Gimme the damn veges!"") in between breaking necks and jumping out of windows, he fits so perfectly into the film that every time he wasn't on screen I found myself just waiting for him to come back. Perhaps my biggest complaint is that he should have had more screen time, but in a film already juggling around a dozen characters, you can't always get what you want. There's always the inevitable sixth entry into the franchise, where hopefully Agent Hobbs will play more of a role.Certainly Fast Five shines in the action scenes, but things aren't so successful if one foolishly tries to think about the logic of the narrative. While it's an interesting move to have Brian (Paul Walker) turning away from his FBI career to help his friend Dom (Diesel), it's hard to see these characters as heroic in any sense. Their desperate self-preservation antics betray a shockingly callous disregard for any innocent bystanders. One would do better to not think about the number of fatalities in the various scenes of destruction around Rio, and even Agent Hobbs and his team, the most obvious 'good-guys', brutally kill their fair share of people. The film attempts to portray all of the people killed as stereotypical corrupt cops and officials, but I did find the amount of violence from the supposed 'heroes' of the film a little distressing. Add to that around 30 minutes of planning for the climactic heist that ultimately becomes unnecessary after a plot twist that changes the whole plan, and the problems with Fast Five's script start to show their presence. But obviously this series was never intended to be admired for its storytelling, and any concerns about the plot are chased away by the excellent action sequences.With Fast Five, Justin Lin has arguably crafted the finest film yet in the franchise. Everyone involved seems to know what this movie needed to be, from the stunning use of practical effects that more than makes up for the awful CGI of the previous film, to the way the ensemble of past characters really pushes the series' constant theme of doing everything for your friends and family. Undoubtedly we will see these characters again, and there is potential for maybe one more outing to round off the story of Dom and Brian. Hopefully Fast Six or whatever silly thing it is eventually titled will match the quality of this entry.",Fast Five

180,CinemaCocoa,"Fast Five, more like Ocean's Eleven?",5,13 April 2017,"Fast Five, more like Ocean's Eleven?Well that was disappointing, and when a Fast and Furious film disappoints, that's pretty bad.Brian O'Conner is on the side of the thieves now as the film picks up where the last left off with him, Mia and others rescuing Dominic from prison. Now they all have the law's worst, most ruthless officer hunting them down The Rock, I mean Dwayne Johnson I mean the The Rock never mind. To finally get away from the law and live free, the team must assemble all of their allies from previous films into a group to rob from the richest Brazilian drug cartel leader.The potential for ridiculous amounts of car racing and chasing could never be higher; the franchise's deliberate step to make things before Tokyo Drift and having all noteworthy characters involved in a heist has to pay off. Well, that does mean we get Tyrese Gibson again.. But on top of that, it really doesn't work.The Fast and the Furious has now officially stepped over the line from being relatively easy going, entertaining racer films, to becoming a never-ending series of ""serious business"". The series has literally forgotten about the cars and instead feels we like the characters enough now to base the entire focus on them (to the point of having Brian and Mia about to have a child)That isn't an overstatement either, asides an opening act train heist, the film takes an hour, an hour, to get into what the series is good at. Street racing. But we don't even see the race, we just get a cheeky cut away since Brian and Dom are obviously going to win it. The assembled team spend most of their time sitting around chatting and being their individual selves from other films (Avengers Assemble, this ain't) and nothing gets done. Most of the film appears to gear towards the two big, burly bald men (Diesel and Johnson) fighting each other which I don't care for, where is the y'know, car racing?The finale is fun to watch as well as ridiculous, and the Ocean's Eleven reference earlier is not unfounded (seems like any film can get away with twists like that nowadays) but it takes so long to get there it doesn't feel particularly tense. This is the first film in the series to go over the two hour runtime, and it did not need it!It isn't precisely a bad film, but it has lost its identity as a niche piece of entertainment and instead settles into generic action movie zone.

It is like they said lets take all the good parts of all the previous films and through it together. Unfortunately it does not work.

184,AdrianOlonan,"""Fast Five"" is Fabulous, Fantastic, and Fun!",10,17 July 2015,"While I love ""Fast and Furious"" franchise, I kinda don't like how they title some installments, such as ""Fast and Furious"" in 2009 (actually a fourth film) and now this. They drop ""furious"" in the fifth film and I don't know why. I guess it's for creative pursuit, but the adjectives ""fast"" and ""furious"" accurately describe the films' premise and atmosphere. Anyway, if you enjoy the previous four films, you'll definitely enjoy this for the fifth time. Dom (Vin Diesel) and Brian (Paul Walker) work together with their friends to disarm a powerful Brazilian drug lord through a 100 million dollar heist. Agent Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) joins this movie, so prepare for greater battle.This is a major shift in the franchise, as they incorporate the heist sub-genre. So there are less racing, but the car chases are still there. I love how they plan their moves to get the vault. The police wants Dom and Brian, so the duo obviously has to run away inside the fast cars! The vault-dragging scene, which is apparently boasted in the trailer, is very fun and high-octane to watch. How the hell did they shoot that in a city? Editing is very good, the music is very pumping for the car sequences, and stunts are crazier than ever. A surprise character enters the storyline, so watch out.This movie reminds me of ""Resident Evil: Retribution"" in terms of action and racial diversity, and it's interesting to note that this film and that film are fifth entries of their own franchises.

186,killbill_28,Solid Sequel,9,21 April 2011,"My first review of 2011 is ""Fast Five"" and once its non stop action. After my major disappointment with the fourth installment my first thought walking into the cinema was pretty much the same reaction after walking out of the fourth movie. Sure the movies now are much focused on action instead of cars however the car scenes in this film surpass the ones from the fourth movie. Justin Lin must of taken pointers after the fourth movie to cut down on the CGI and use more real life cars and stuntman, this has paid off.The overall result isn't perfect but its sure a hell lot better. The cars in this film mainly are American Muscle V8's with the odd Japanese import every now and then. The writing of the film is a lot better and there actually a story and character development that was missing from the fourth movie. It was great to finally have most of the characters from the all the movies into one for one big adventure.The only cons about this movie is running time of 130 minutes, to date its the longest ""Furious"" movie in the series and should have been cut down. Another con is lack of races. Sure there where cars but not enough racing to pleasure the hardcore ""Furious"" fan. However there is a few show stoppers that will please these included the fight between Vin Diesel and The Rock, the million dollar quarter mile race which includes the four main characters in Dodge Chargers and the climax which includes a giant safe, two bad ass Chargers, a bridge and a lot of smashed police cars.Younger viewers will be turned off this movie due to the lack of racing and the films length, I counted at least 15 young people walking out after 30 minutes into the film. The first major races doesn't happen until a hour into the film. Recommended",Fast Five

But what really bothered me was the lack of creativity (hah, that rhymed), that makes us all fortunetellers.

Upon getting there they meet up with Vince from the first film and get into a lot of trouble, putting them in the sights of the kingpin of Rio crime as well as a federal agent, played by the Rock, who believes that Dom and O'Conner were responsible for the death of some DEA agents.We're back to the second film as far as the opening goes.

The group winds up obtaining a microchip containing the location of all the kingpin's money drops and leads them to set up a hit to get all the money. Pretty much the entire cast returns to do the job, including Tej, Roman, and Han.The movie starts heavy with great action and then slows down for the set-up of the heist. Typically this middle slump is where the films fall apart and become an exercise in waiting. But Fast Five is very enjoyable because of the return of all our favorite characters. These are still pretty bare-bones creations, but they play off each other well and lead to some fun banter.The Rock makes his debut in the Fast franchise and is excellent. He's exactly what you'd want for a hard federal agent. If anyone is a shining star in this film, it's Johnson.And unlike previous movies, the action in this film is entertaining and doesn't fall flat at any point. The final scene, in which two cars pull a bank vault through the streets of Rio, is absolutely ridiculous and stupid but it's the best scene the series has to offer so far.Fast Five changes the focus of the films from racing to being cheesy action movies. This is the point where traditional Fast fans started to turn away. But for me, this marks the beginning of something that could be good. I was thoroughly entertained and that's something I can't say about any of the other films. The focus has changed to a place it obviously should have been to start.Fast Five breaks the franchise out of the slog of mediocrity and gives it its first truly good film.",Fast Five

Seriously, every time he appeared on screen he looked like he could use a nap. Maybe he realized how bad this is and did not want to give an effort.I enjoyed 1 and 2nd FnF and did not watch rest of them except this last one.Except for few funny scenes and Dwayne Johnson rest is plain crap. Nothing is consistent. Pretty much like Transformers 3. You simply jump from one scene in no particular order and that is annoyance.Supporting cast is completely obnoxious and that was not easy to achieve.Don't bother to watch as I can not with describing how bad it is any longer.",Fast Five

192,imdb-58910,Best action film,10,7 February 2021,"Last week I saw Fast and Furious 5 / Fast five at the home. The main actors in this film are Paul Walker, Vin Diesel, and Dwayne Johnson...
This film is an action thriller . This film is a story of two guys, Bryan who is an ex-policeman, and Dominic Torreto which is one of the best race drivers, and this hobby connects these two guys. These two guys have a plan how to steal 100 million dollars so they must do a really good team which will help them. But cop Hopps wants to catch them because Dominic and Bryan must be in prison for their actions. But in the end, he finds out they are not bad people and he helps them.
The characters of Paul and Dominic are interesting because in the last films they weren't really good friends. But now they will be a true family and their adventures will be better . However, this film is really about friendship between all these characters.
In my opinion, Fast and Furious films are one of the most popular in the world, so this film was fast-moving and gripping all the time. Special effects and stunts were so impresive. Like in all Fast and Furious films this has to some good music songs. I think is a ""tradition"" when these films have a good music.",Fast Five
193,Arconada,Glorifying murder?,3,22 June 2013,"The amount of plot holes in this movie make it difficult to classify it as an action movie. Much has been written here about the absurdity of the script. Just to give one extra example: sneaking into a police station to examine a safe by blowing up the men's room and breaking a man size hole in the wall, and still letting your audience believe it went unnoticed; it is to silly for words. So, I tried to look at it as a comedy, but it didn't fit either. The only objection I want to add to the list is the way Luke Hobbs shoots a defenceless man begging for help, even though he is the bad guy in this movie. I know, it's the American fairytale, the good guys shoot the bad guys and everybody lives happily ever after, but this is the glorification of brutal murder. You can't do that, not even in silly movies like this.",Fast Five
194,jmcginn174,Getting Better With Age,8,16 June 2011,"The Fast and the Furious franchise seems to be getting better with age. The first on was a good movie. Then the second one came out which was average at best than Toyko Drift came out and that was just plan terrible. I considered the franchise dead after that but then I saw Fast and the Furious and it gave life to the franchise. It's rare to see a franchise getting better with age. Usually Things start to go down hill after the second movie of a franchise. From the Lethal Weapon movies, to the Terminator movies and of course all of the horror genre. So it's surprisingly rare for a franchise to survive the test of time and you wouldn't expect this franchise to be one of them and Fast Five might be the best movie of them all.Fast Five has a above average story. Starting almost directly after the first one. The overall story is about the core group trying to find a way out of the endless running from the law and family. There's another plot about a drug lord and a missing computer chip but it isn't very good. That shouldn't matter to most simply because you don't go to see this type of movie for a amazing story and great acting. You coming to see the great action, cool cars, and hot women. You get plenty of all three in this. Still I'd say this is the best story of all the movies since the first one.The acting OK but look at the actors none of the are great actors and none of them are going to win Oscars in their acting career. Still all the actors from Paul Walker to Tyrese Gibson to Sung Kang to Dwayne Johnson aka THE ROCK are having a good time and have great chemistry which makes up for the acting.Now for what everyone goes to these movies for the action. Which is mind blowing. From a scene where a group steal cars from a moving train. Another was a on foot chase in slums of Brazil(Which the movie was filmed and is beautiful.) where Dwayne Johnson and Vin Diesel go one on one in one of the one one action scenes you'll see with out CGI. Finally there's the climax which I won't say anything about but will blow you away.Also there is a scene after the main credits that will imply what the inevitable next movie will be about.Overall this is the best of the franchise with great visuals and action and a above average story and decent acting.",Fast Five
195,MrJRGO,Fast and a lot more furious.,8,5 May 2011,"For anyone who thinks this ten year old franchise might be running out of fuel, have no fear because on the basis of Fast Five, it could run for another decade. This is the longest of the five films and in my opinion, it is the best.The film contains two of the best action scenes I have seen in the franchise. Fast Five is all that you'd expect and more. However, the cars and the girls aren't quite the major players they are in previous movies but they're there nonetheless, so don't be disappointed.Fast Five sees a buffed up Dom and a loved up Brian and Mia flee to Rio after they become fugitives of US law. There they decide to do one final heist and invite some old friends back to take part. This is no ordinary heist either and involves getting on the wrong side of some extremely dangerous people.The old faces are back with Roman and Tej but it is the comedic banter of the two new faces in the team - Don Omar and Tego Calderon - that I enjoyed the most. And Sung Kang and Gal Gadot aren't just making up the numbers. She has a figure to make your eyes pop out !! For me though, the cream of the movie is the much anticipated arrival of Dwayne Johnson as Federal Agent Hobbs. He is superb and I'd be surprised if he doesn't feature strongly in the next film. His role opposite Diesel works a treat and in my opinion, neither one outdoes the other.There is more effort at plot and character development in Fast Five than previous outings and some people may be surprised at how events unfold. It might not be for the best but we will have to wait and see.Rio is the perfect setting with the sun drenched streets and alleys of the favelas as well as the constant menace of the omnipotent local drugs lords. These guys are ruthless characters and very well armed, with a stranglehold over the local law enforcement agencies too.All in all, a welcome return for everyone concerned. Keep your eyes open during the credits for some extras that you won't want to miss. I'm already looking forward to the next film. I just can't think what title they'll come up with !!",Fast Five

197,richenstony,"Fast And Furious , Lame and slow",3,22 April 2011,"Words can not sum up just how bored i was whilst watching this today in the cinema , it was without a doubt the worst film I've seen all year , and i love the fast and furious franchise it was so boring and dull and the plot was just lame , its supposed to be about underground street racing gangs knocking off other people for money and merchandise , instead we see a bulky bald headed guy run around with his breasts out for 2 hours saying , YOU FAMILY , YOU FAMILY , the script was just poor and you see none and i mean none of the Proper racing , just when you think your about to see a kick ass drag race the director pulls to a cocky shot of them already winning the suited up car , because these guys are just to good to loose.... -.-If you ask me , and I'm surely doubting you will , this movie has absolutely nothing to do with cars or the fast and the furious , its about them trying to evade the law without cars! I thought that was the point of these films , to show us cool cars and cool stunts with cars , pulling a safe out of a wall in the middle of Rio and dragging it 15 miles isn't exactly what i call a decent insight to the films premise.Here's how i define the franchise not including this film:Nice cars , Detailed descriptions, of what make the cars good , Nice Illegal ,street races, Japanese women in skimpy skirts holding up the flags.That's all i ask out of films like this , but instead its pulled away and and attempted to try and be more sophisticated and its failed in my opinion.My sister enjoyed it , but she lacks braincells , and anyone else who enjoyed this film is short of a few themselves , i actually fell asleep a bit in the cinema my sister had to punch me awake because i was snoring.",Fast Five
198,HandHStudios,Great Racing and Action Flick,6,19 March 2013,"I've seen the rest of the Fast and the Furious movies, and hoped this one was going to be just as good. And it was! In fact, i liked this one better than the original! It had great action, thrills, and was the same kind of story as the other ones. Of course, i have to comment on the undeveloped story, flat characters, and unrealistic parts of the movie. Of course, i knew i was going to have to suspend disbelief going in, but some of the sequences of action in this movie were too hard to overlook. They fall from a 1000 ft high bridge, plummeting into water, but of course, they are okay! Also, the plot and acting was iffy. This is a generic action thriller with lots of one-liners and car crashes. But that's all that we came for right? So that makes it a little bit better. If car chases, thrills, and kills are your criteria that you look for in movies, then definitely see this one. You won't be disappointed.HandHStudios Rating: 6.2/10",Fast Five
199,nvjs,The stars are NOT the cars in this one.,2,8 June 2013,"So when this entry skips the cars for the sake of an ensemble cast/heist movie, it does detract from the experience. There was only the opening and climax with any noteworthy driving sequences! No street races for titles or anything like that. Okay, then there's that whole eclectic ensemble of F&F stars who come together as a motley crew of thieving bastards. But now, the gang fancy themselves as neo-Robin Hoods. Whereas before, they were out for theirs. They still are, but now they need a contrast to frame themselves in a better light. Finally, the ""climax"" ? I don't think two Chargers, even with two 6.1 Hemis and even a 7.17:1 axle ratio, could heft a vault with the ease they expect us to believe. All in all ? The worst F&F entry in the series. Especially considering the cast and what Lin had to work with.Something else, why did Diesel skip starring in the second and third ? Did his ""career"" not blossom as expected ? Is he trying to reignite that fire that did wonders for him 12 years ago with the original ? I'm inclined to believe so. Watch this film at your dismay. If you're expecting a lot of action around cars ?, be ready for sorrow. I'll 2nd the motion for a do-over.",Fast Five
200,9thgraders,Many stunts and the plot is so original,9,11 February 2019,"This film is so amazing, it's the best film I've ever seen.I saw this film many times in different languages. I discovered it in 2011 when I was 7 years old.I really love this movie, it's an action film there are many stunts and the plot is so original.Dominic Toretto was saved by Brian and Mia. They leave for Brazil where they are attacked by Hernan Reyes, he's a baron of a cartel of dealers. He has the police on his side but he can't arrest Dominic Toretto and his teams.There is Roman Pierce played by Tyrese Gibson, Tej Parker played by Lucadris and another guy ready to steal the chest with Hernan Reyes's money.This film was released in May 2011 in France and April in the USA. It was directed by Justin Lin and written by Chris Morgan.The film has an album of music. It was produced by Don Omar ,he plays in the film too. Dominic Toretto is played by Vin diesel, Brian O'Conner by Paul Walker, Mia toretto by Jordana Brewster and Luke Hobbs by the best actor Dwayne Johnson.Fast and Furious 5 is the fifth of the 8 films.

202,musanna-ahmed,The fastest and most furious ride yet.,9,21 April 2011,"Making a sequel to a film is never normally a good thing. They excite  all the fans of the previous film(s) and then disappoint them with a  production that is not better than the original. The same goes for a  remake. Some films turn into a series where each film becomes worse   this has been the case with the Fast and Furious series. However this  fifth film is one that outclasses its predecessors, read on to see why.  Fast Five continues where Fast and Furious left off, with Dominic  sentenced to 25 years in jail and the bus chase that was seen at the  end involving Mia and Brian. The aftermath of their interception was  that they managed to break Dom out of custody, dodged every authority,  and have fled to Rio de Janeiro (where every Brazilian seems to be  portrayed as a gun-toting thug). In order to break free, they attempt  to pull off a 100 million dollar heist. It isn't long before they all  become a few of the most wanted criminals. Their mission that rips  through Brazil sees two on their tail  federal agent Luke Hobbs  (Dwayne Johnson), who never lets anyone escape and corrupt drug lord  Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida) who wants them dead.  That's not really a witty plot. And there aren't great performances  guided by a witty script either so rule out suspenseful conversations  and memorable dialogue. A merit goes to the Dwayne Johnson though  he  was perfectly cast for his role and shows a lot more of his talky WWE  side unlike his last film Faster where he was virtually on mute. But  Fast and Furious has never been known for excelling in those aspects of  filmmaking. It's known for the action scenes. And what spectacular  action scenes there are in Fast Five. It takes it turn to be more of  The Expendables instead of the previous films of the series by having a  'men on a mission' plot element and emphasising more on fighting than  racing. There's more road rage in here than street racing, and for the  record there's even an ex-wrestler versus action hero fight like there  was when Stone Cold fist fought Sly Stallone.  The first act of the film is fast and furious. It quickly takes the  audience on a relentless train ride where we see a train robbery in  process. This act quickly builds up a background for the story so the  audience knows who, what, when, how and why the team are in Brazil. The  second act revolves around the main plot element of the $100 million  heist. The film decelerates slightly here when we see the crew  plotting. Anyone who would have seen the details of the film beforehand  would realise why  this lasts over 2 hours, longer than all of the  previous films. The 10 minutes after a full two hours weren't really  necessary but show us the aftermath of the third act, the hugely  thrilling act. Any who feel frustrated at the pace of the second act   stay for the climactic scene in the third act.  Think of Fast Five as the cinematic equivalent of a mindless muscular  athlete. Can't talk a good game but can surely play a good game. We  have all met that person, that guy who failed his exams but took the  football pitch by storm at high school. Fast Five is as absent minded   plain characters and clunky dialogue. But the 'physical' side is where  it amazes  the action scenes of course. It's like the men behind the  camera decided to perfect the action scenes, the plot was secondary.  Looking at this year's earlier films The Mechanic and The Green Hornet,  it's safe to say that Fast Five has the best action sequences of the  year yet, and is the best action film overall so far.  Verdict: Forgive the simplicity of the script and get ready for the  fastest and most furious ride yet.",Fast Five
203,KrazzyDJ,"Not a Five Star title, but definitely Fast",7,8 May 2011,"The producers / distributors / makers (call them what you may) behind this movie have decided to transition The Fast And The Furious Series of movies from a street racing franchise into an action / heist one with car chases at its helm instead of the notorious street races that governed most of the previous movies. Had I not watched any of the past movies, I would have certainly welcomed this move. But after seeing all four of them (in anticipation of this one), I believe that leaving out street racing from this movie was not a pretty good idea - there's just one race in this movie and that too, is a friendly sort of no stakes race. Although I can understand the studio's motives behind doing so, The Fast And The Furious series of films deserve at the least one race per film.Anyways, enough of the complaining already. Coming to the point, which is Fast Five, the movie is surely fast and equally furious. The fourth movie ended with Paul and Mia attempting to bust out Dom from prison with an animated escape shown in the end. The fifth movie begins just at that point with a live action escape sequence replacing the animated one at the end of the previous installment. After a job that goes awry, the trio are then on the run since they're wanted by two factions of people - the crew of a businessman Reyes and the team of a DSS agent Luke Hobbs. After running around for some time, they decide to pull one last job to buy out their freedom with fake passports and start life afresh. But with these two powerful men on their tails, it ain't gonna be that easy.Fast Five is more of an action movie and so, for it to work, there has to be action. And there is - plenty of it. Without spoiling most of it by describing it in detail, I'd say the high points of the movie are the train job at the start that goes awry and sets up the events of the movie, the trio's escape from both teams who get to them simultaneously over rooftops, a fight between Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) and of course, the finale which is absolute madness. And perhaps all of the sequences have been shot without any use of CGI which is what makes the action even all the more exciting and brings back memories of the past era of action movies where all sequences were filmed rather than digitally created.The cinematography is top notch as well. Although there are a lot of cuts in action sequences, we still get some long continuous areal views of the action (long meaning lasting around 5 seconds or so) which helps understanding what's going on and where it all fits into the surroundings. This ensures you're with the action. Performances are decent and for a mostly wooden Paul Walker reprising his role as Brian O'Connor, you have a surprisingly flexible Dwayne Johnson playing Luke Hobbs - the new entry in the franchise. His character is exactly what he told it would be in the behind the scenes featurettes - strong, efficient at nabbing criminals and a worthy antagonist to Dominic Toretto and his team mates. I'd definitely want him to return in the next installment. And although this ain't a movie about characters, we get some dialogs which actually help us understand the characters a little better giving us some insight into their lives. Nothing deeply psychological - just a tinge of what's hidden beneath the surface. Nice.On the whole, Fast Five is solid entertainment provided you're willing to suspend your disbelief and forget the laws of physics. But then, we always do suspend our disbelief to some extent in movies - that's what they're for. And none of us really does remember the laws of physics so they're irrelevant for the most part. In which case, the movie comes highly recommended and even more so for an action movie buff. This is the definitive action movie of the year. And do stay for some time for a nice post credits surprise which unlike many meaningless sequences, is a critical post-credits scene that might set up the next installment in the series.Score: 7.0 / 10",Fast Five
204,limoncella-641-42235,"Gratuitous and routine, but highly enjoyable in places",4,24 April 2011,"I'll start by saying i was never a big fan of the fast and the furious movies, but this is definitely the one i liked the most.The story starts off with Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and former cop Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) living as fugitives following the events of the last movie. They retreat to Rio de Janeiro upon hearing about a ""job"". Soon they find themselves fixated on stealing money from a corrupt Brazillian businessman, and making a fresh start. The FBI has also hired Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) a highly revered DSS agent to track down Toretto and 0'Conner and arrest them both.The film basically becomes a run-of-the-mill heist film that pulls many tricks that countless other heist have done before or better.The pacing of the film is very uneven, the action scenes are fast-paced with quick edits. But when someone isn't driving/running/shooting at something the movie doesn't just slow down - it grinds to a complete halt. This is likely because the dialogue is flat and the way the actors deliver is lacks any real emotion, going through every cliché in the heist film handbook.Paul walker is his usual bland self, I consider him the king of underacting. Vin Diesel is okay, but his delivery is slurred and not always legible and he looks physically tired throughout most of the film. Every other member of the cast is forgettable, Tyrese Gibson, Ludicrous, Sung Kang etc. All the women are underdeveloped sex-objects that all look the same. I can imagine the casting call: 'Call every ""other guy"" from the last 4 movies and see who says ""yes""'. It surprises me to say that Dwayne Johnson was the best actor in this, he seems to actually be trying with his performance and he has a few genuinely badass scenes.The driving scenes in the movie (as far as I could tell) appeared to mostly use practical effects rather than throw a load of CG cars around - I hugely admire this decision and it looks damn good. The climax of this movie is genuinely awesome, the whole part where they're dragging a safe through Rio (as implausible as it may be) is brilliantly shot and edited.Bottom line is this - If you like the last 4 films, you will enjoy this one. If you hated the last films there is absolutely no reason for you to see this because if you do you will hate it even more than those films.I would recommend people to get this movie on DVD as a rental, that way you can skip all the arduous dialogue scenes and go straight to the action.",Fast Five

The movie was packed with action from start to finish... I had only seen the first film previous to this so there was a connection with the characters which are very likable, and by now if you have see the previous movies, very likable.I was excited to see Dwayne Johnson (the Rock) can actually ACT!!! :) I liked it so much, I am pulling the previous movie out of the shelf tonight to watch.One thing I will say is: Stay and watch ALL the credits.

206,prateak09,The BEST of the franchise!,8,18 May 2011,"The franchise resurrects. The cast matures. The crew grows up. And, The Rock joins the gang. The derailed series is finally back on track since the original with upgrades in all the departments of film-making. if you think this is a movie with races, you're wrong. Taking a different route this time, the film makers have transformed the street racing franchise into the heist action film which isn't a bad thing, this transformation has worked wonders for the movie & the franchise. Fast Five is the genuine summer blockbuster of the year, without a doubt. Its the kind of big action, big Ka-pow movie that the audience doesn't want to get bogged down in the details on if they just want to have fun. The situations these guys go through is unbelievable, we know that the way these characters drive they should all have died in the first Fast and Furious, but we know this is just a fun and entertaining franchise and we try to make peace with the screenplay as best we can because it is just fun to see these guys go at it. It's fun to see them drive cars off a running train, or speed by busy streets without crashing into each other while at the same time avoiding all sorts of bullets and explosions. Fast Five might be the most unbelievable and improbable film of the franchise, but it is still the best one. While this movie doesn't have much straight up street racing its got plenty of everything else. This is the one sequel where they got the action right on all aspects. Not much CGI at all unless it was so good you couldn't tell. Vin Diesel & Paul Walker continue to be effective in their respective parts. Jordana Brewster is fair. Tyrese Gibson is first-rate and brings in a host of laughs in the goings-on. Ludicrous is good. Matt Schulze, Sung Kang & Gal Gadot are passable. Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson is absolutely superb in a strong supporting role. He imposes as a formidable rival. Here Johnson's straight arrow persona leverages the story's ultimate conflict. Showcasing Director Justin Lin's signature accelerated precision, Vin Diesel's Dom races beside the speeding train as Paul Walker's Brian leaps into Dom's sports car. Their car immediately sways over a steep chasm into the river below. Diesel and Walker leap in midair out of the car, and plunge into the water. ""Fast Five"" is just great fun. Writer Chris Morgan's story is better than the last ""Fast and Furious"", which isn't saying much. Then again we don't see ""Fast Five"" for the narrative nuances. Non-stop action reigns supreme. Lin has a crisp vibrant visual style, and acumen for insane action. Lin has two cars racing through the streets of Rio dragging a bank vault unleashing mass destruction. Granted this is over the top, and completely original. ""Fast Five"" has stunning Rio de Janeiro locals, gorgeous women, fast cars, and Vin Diesel squaring off against ""The Rock"" Dwayne Johnson. Lin has methodically checked off all the boxes. The Taiwanese director is getting really good with his craft. Car chase is obviously the top draw. Just as you wonder what else he can give you that you haven't seen before, he comes up with things that take you to yet another level of mindless pleasure. The movie doesn't linger onto any dramatic scenes for too long. The filmmakers know that their target audience came for the fast cars and action. Who cares about any subplots and talking? The Rock makes a grand entrance and is provided with enough screen time to make The Rock fans happy. I also like the turn of events with his character near the end. It was handled brilliantly. Fast Five delivers what it promises and even more. There are a lot of action sequences and they are shot extremely well. The cars move really fast, but that isn't all Fast Five has going for it. The addition of The Rock to the story sets up an interesting fight scene between him and Dominic(which is one of my all time favorite fight sequence). The Rock helped boost the series even more and brought something fresh to the franchise. There is also the plus that the film took place in Rio de Janeiro and the scenery there is just so beautiful. There is a great chase scene that takes place over the roofs of the houses, reminiscent of the Bourne Ultimatum scene in Morocco. Yes, the story is improbable, but we still are allowed to have fun with it. Cinematography is perfect. The soundtrack is also great.""Fast Five"" is not going to win any awards. It is just great fun. I look forward to the next sequel.I rate it 7.5 out of 10.",Fast Five

A comic book movie with other universes, and I think there are more plot devices in Fast Five that requires the audience to suspend logic than there are in Thor! Not trying to do a spoiler post here, so I won't go in to them. Its the kind of big action, big Ka-pow movie that the audience doesn't want to get bogged down in the details on if they just want to have fun. (Where's all the money for stuff coming from, how'd that car do that, federal agents really have that on their computers, very rich criminals would really do that?) Ha.

Action, action and more action, YES! Acting, direction, story, ehh. Who cares: they destroyed more cars in 60 seconds than I ever thought possible. The Rock was in top physical condition compared to a flabby and fast aging Vin Diesel. The brawl was so darkly shot that I suppose they could have been naked mud wrestling and nobody would have been the wiser.Overall, fast and fun. Do not expect ANYONE to win ANY awards for ANYTHING that happened here; just let it flow over you. BTW, are foley artists retarded? Beer in a bottle being tipped back for a drink does not sound like a half-filled bottle of water being inverted. And, not every motion has to have some artificial sound effect attached to it. Much more satisfying is the slight sucking sound as the bottle leaves the lips and a mild belch following. Pullleeez.Ciao, babies.",Fast Five

First one was a good surprise, fresh and at some point original, 2nd one was really bad maybe cause vin diesel was not participating in that one but in the end it sucked, I never saw tokio drift and the last one was a mix of bad acting, bad plot barely decent action and some CGI effects that looked very fake. But OMG this one has it all, from beginning to end is great entertainment, nothing more nothing less. Its like having together the best parts of the franchise with a touch of oceans eleven and some action scenes that are simply jaw dropping. This is how all the past movies should have been and being this a 5th part that is quit an achievement maybe it is an exaggeration but for me this is the masterpiece of all the 5th parts. Definitely worth the price of the ticket and I cant wait to see it in blu ray and replay a few times the last half hour of the movie.",Fast Five

I love Fast and Furious movies they we're always amazing for me. Now to the movie it is awesome movie because of the action.The action is just amazing and the cars are sweet. Testosterone Rock as a new one to the crew is perfect and good old Dome is just bad-ass and Brian he is just good.I liked that he has way more action then he had it the other movies.Paul Walker wasn't Oscar worthy actor but he did the job and i thing that he managed it very well especially the scenes where he rage in that way I think he's perfect. So the action is totally perfect acting is very good and dialogs are very good too. I love the movie.I love everything about it.It's just Mind blowing movie.,Fast Five
212,JosephPorta2000,Simply the best in the entire franchise,10,17 April 2020,"3:21 AM, during the coronavirus outbreak, time to write some things about this one. Head straight, You should know I've seen it like 5 times and for me it's one of those I'll never get bored watching, so it's a review for those desperate ones like me.
This is what I've got:
1.I think this is the last movie in which Dom was human(kind of) and at least they didn't save the galaxy or something(you know what I mean)
2.I like the refferences to the first movie in the series: After Vince messes up and then shows when the family is about to eat, Dom is asking ""Vince, are you hungry?"". Another thing is, you know, Dom got 2 years in jail for beating that man with a wrench. In fast 5, when he fights Hobbs and got the opportunity to crash his skull in the same manier he choses to crash the concrete below(I still don't understand how the first man survived until Dom's hand was sore)
3.We have all the family reunited, except for Letty. I'm not a big fan of her, so let's say The Rock for Letty is a fair trade.
4.The end when we hear Dansa Kuduro and everybody got their freedom and things always make me forget about anything and just be happy. If Yu've seen Tokyo Drift ( and I hope You did), You probably love han and you know he dies in there, but the action in fast 5 is before tokyo drift happens.(7 will clarify it) It's nice how they show Han at the end with his girl and she says ""I thought we're going to Tokyo"". Han response is ""We'll get there, eventually"", so that make us think that before he dies in tokyo drift he had lots of fun in Europe :)

We have Toretto and Brian again as the invincible superheroes and I found it entertaining for that same reason.I liked the return of old characters because the first installment really liked me. The quality and visual effects were good, in the same way that they recorded in a destination like Brazil (which should have taken advantage of more).I want to point out that I, as a Venezuelan, feel proud that they include Latinos on the Anglo-Saxon screen, but I think that the characters of Don Omar and Tego Calderón (who are not actors) were silly, the little interpretation they made was disappointing.The film in general overcomes the incredible and ridiculous on many occasions but it has fun.",Fast Five

So pass on this one, there are many other films like this that things blow up there is a silly plot twist at the end like two safes yes it was silly and it could not save a pathetic film. All the cops in Brazil are less corrupt then the ones in the good old USA. What are you crazy? I saw fast five and the steroid actors from USA were way better than all the crooked Brazilins with Spanish accents so thick that I, I had a flash back thing all the Nazis have British ascents but the British fought the Nazis and the Americans only came in at the end of the war after all the money was gone in selling to the Nazis. Well the dumbest thing about the film is the Cars try out driving a Caraochi in Rio you may as well speak Paulistia Portuguse.

217,LordElrondd,Maybe Too Fast !!,8,7 May 2011,"Fast Five was exactly what I expected. Fast, lots of action and car chases.At some point events made no sense to me. and i think maybe the reason for that is the the new characters have no depth to them.But on the other hand if you are a fan of big car chases and explosions, you could have a lot of fun watching this.The acting was pretty good. Van diesel was my favorite as always. If watch the trailer you will see that its pretty much the same thing in the movie. i mean all of the important scenes are in the tailer.But this film is the best out of all of them. And it could be the best action film of the year.Oh, and if you are going to watch it, make sure that you watch the clip after the Credits !!!",Fast Five
218,Strawberry_Typhoon,The Fast and the Furious has morphed into quite the little action series,8,1 May 2011,"Before we get started, I want to get something off of my chest. For a long time, the Fast and the Furious franchise has been a big guilty pleasure of mine. Sure, they're silly, unrealistic, and way over the top, but they're fun, and exciting. Not ever cinematic experience has to mirror The English Patient. Sometimes I just want to see car chases, and sht blowing up. This series, despite it's many flaws, manages to provide the audience with enough eye candy and carnage to solidify it's spot in pop culture history. When the trailer premiered, and revealed to me that I would be seeing a host of returning characters, coupled with Dwayne Johnson versus Vin Diesel. I was on board instantly. I even learned that The Liberal Dead's own Ted Brown had a soft spot for the series as well. When I finally sat down to consume the new installment, my expectations were off the charts.Following the example that the previous film set, Fast Five is more of a crime/action flick, than another rice-a-roni car porn. Many people were not fans of the previous film, but I admired it for the direction that it took the franchise. It may sound silly, especially considering the material, but it almost felt like the franchise had matured. Whereas previous sequels tried to re-capture the flavor of the first film, focusing almost entirely on the cars, and the races, ""Fast and Furious"" revisited the original characters, and showed us what the events of their first romp has done to their lives. There's almost something magical and mysterious about the ending of the first film. It certainly romanticizes the fact that Brian let Dominic go, rather than bringing him to justice. But what are the consequences for everyone involved? These are the questions that were answered in the last film, and now expanded upon in series' return.Fast Five begins where the previous film concluded. Brian, now rogue from the FBI has rounded up a furious carpool to bust Dominic out of police custody. Living on the run in Rio, Brian and Mia reconnect with Vince, and try to pull off a heist to help get their heads above water. When Dominic shows up with the crime already in progress, he senses a double-cross, and alters the plan preventing the crew from meeting up with the man that hired them for the job. The man turns out to be the #1 kingpin in all of Rio, and he orchestrates a wide-net search party, including his own henchmen, as well as the majority of the local police, who happen to be on his payroll. Since several US federal agents where found dead in the aftermath of the robbery, a US Special Forces team is sent to apprehend Brian and Dominic, who they think are responsible for the deaths. Leading the team is Special Agent Hobbs, played by Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson.The introduction of Hobbs as a character, pits two completely larger than life action heroes against one another. This not only appeals to the sensibilities of action fans across the globe, but it leads to one of the most exciting scenes of hand to hand combat in recent history. Dwayne and Vin have a terrific amount of on-screen chemistry, and could very easily go on to make movies outside of the F&F universe, both versus, as well as on the same side. Say what you want about either man, but both of them have several solid films under their belt. Hopefully the decision to put these two titans in the same film yields the obvious intended result, and Fast Five will end up dominating the box office.Enough characters return from the previous films to appeal to franchise fans, but the story and the situation generates crossover appeal as well. Even though it's a continuing story arch, anyone looking for a popcorn action flick can walk into the theater and walk out satisfied, even if you're completely unfamiliar with the four previous films.The Fast and the Furious has morphed into quite the little action series, and despite the satisfying amount of closure the film leaves you with, it also leaves just enough open so that a plethora of sequels are not only able to be produced and make sense in the context of this film, but have the potential to actually be enjoyable films. Fast and Furious has become the Saw of the action genre. The only difference being, I actually hope they make a couple more F&F films, especially after the scene that occurs after the end credits. I can't wait to see where they're going to take it from here.",Fast Five

Not much racing as the others, but what is there truly keeps you glued to your seat. Screenplay was interesting, locations eye-catching and casting, already stated! It's one of those movies which you like a lot while watching it and then later think about what happened within it at random times. Yes, you may not want to give it a second view immediately or even soon after, but you just may replay those highlighted scenes, for example, when Vin Diesel and ""The Rock"" face off.

It defies the laws of logic, storytelling, and physics at every turn and it just goes on and on and on. And so predictable--especially if you've seen Oceans 11.I almost walked out during the ""climactic"" final chase. Such a snoozefest.The dialogue and stunts are laughable--and the mayhem and destruction in the last 30 minutes are numbing and unbearable. You keep looking, asking ""Where are all the bodies? There must be hundreds or thousands of people killed during this chase."" But nope, you don't see any bodies because there aren't any. No people on the streets of Rio during broad daylight even though in every previous shot the streets were jammed with pedestrians. My god this film was boring. It's the first film I've seen in Imax and it'll probably be the last-- seems pretty clear that's just a marketing scam to get people to see movies that would otherwise tank. I'm sure you'll ignore my review and see it anyway. That's cool, but bring a good book.",Fast Five
224,yora217,The Greatest Fast and the Furious since the first one and its even better!!!!!,10,6 May 2011,"Im not usually a fan of sequels, considering a lot of them are not as good as the original, this was indeed the case with the Fast and the Furious franchise, the first one was purely original and fun to watch while the sequels were not as good. This movie however proved me wrong. This Fast and the Furious story takes place after the fourth movie and picks up right from where they left it off and immediately finishes off with little time to take in. Dominic Played by Vin Diesal has broken out of prison with the help of Paul Walker and Doms sister. The overall story is not the most original thing I've ever heard of but in a way its a nice turn for the series considering the second movie felt more like an episode then a movie, i have no idea what the third movie was, and the fourth was a repeat of the first movie. This time around, Paul is not a cop but rather a fugitive on the run, i really liked this turn for him because i often wondered how many times could they allow him to return to being a cop. Many characters from the past movies come back here, so if you haven't seen the past movies, you will be lost as to who's who and whats their role to play in the story. New to this story is Dwayne Johnson who plays a ruthless but hardcore villain who is determined to capture Dom and his group. I gotta say, this is one of the only film roles i have seen Dwayne in that i actually like, i think he finally found the role that may define the rest of his career. The fight between Dwayne and Vin was indeed the Arnold and Sylvester fight everyone has been waiting for since the 80's. The movie has tons of girls in bikinis, fast cars, and a lot more action this time around. My only complaint if anything is the beginning, i kind of wish they hadnt rushed it like they did, im the kind of person that enjoys a good introduction, and the beginning was alittle too much emphasis, so thats about it everything else was fantastic. Also the shocking revelation in the end may send shivers down hardcore fans of the genre, others will not understand it, but i will say for those of you who have seen the past movies, you will get a real kick out of the ending, for those of you who haven't, see the past ones before seeing this one. If you have already given up on the franchise, watch this movie to change your frame of mind, it will make a difference.",Fast Five
225,StudioLAX,Most average F'n'F yet,1,25 April 2011,"RE: 19 April 2011 | by corey_dw (Australia) After varying degrees of success with the franchise, My faith that ""Fast 5"" could deliver on the hype was waning somewhat. However despite the fact this film hasn't been released yet and I've not actually seen it but I work for the studio I am pleased to say the series hasn't redeemed itself. Fast 5 pulls out no stops this time around. It almost delivers on action, cars, poor quality acting and a hackneyed storyline. It doesn't bother exploring the character personalities, not showing humour, fear, vulnerability and determination this time around which gives the movie no strength or depth also missing from previous Fast n Furious movies. I found myself cringing out loud a few times at the unsubtle humour, and leaning forward for the action scenes which should've been truly amazing.The Story is predictable and will not keep the surprises coming to the end. The Cast has not matured and it shows in the lack of quality of acting over previous F'n'F movies. Ironically, one of the production companies involved is called Original Productions.Pros:Average pace throughout the movieAverage storyline and plotAverage Cast of actors/ actresses Unimaginative and un-inventive elements throughoutOne or two ""Wow"" momentsCons: Would be nice to have more screen time for the carsa 130 cheesy moments ( but this adds to the humour of the film)Overall: Highly recommended if you have low expectations, nothing better to do and a free cinema ticket, or your a complete drone with no imagination who likes retarded films with spoon fed plots.

226,deathiscoming-1,"Fast, fun and mindless fury ... once again",7,30 April 2011,"I went into this movie expecting the usual; fast cars and hot babes held together with a more than flimsy action-packed story line and Justin Lin seemed to schizophrenically deliver (or did he?). The movie starts with a famously stolen and instantly aggravating ""one last job"" scene, obviously not something any movie goer can believe in this instance because let's face it who finishes a movie series on its fifth? This movie sees the return of all the usual (and previous) F&F characters and same tricks of the trade we have seen Brian and Dom perfect with all the usual so-called tense last minute escapes Hollywood has rinsed dry, yet still this movie does deserve its 7/10 rating.How? Rio and the favelas are beautifully shot, the new characters are refreshing and VERY well casted, the vehicles are awesome, although lacking in their usual ""bling"" quality and the witty humour running through from previous F&F's is a little bonus for fans of the previous movies. Coupled with a sprinkling of nail biting moments and generous helpings of laugh-out-loud moments this testosterone injected movie is no doubt a fun, easy on the mind movie to go and watch.Unfortunately, like all ""fun and easy on the mind"" movies, the simplicity of it all becomes very predictable and the same is true for this movie. The story line, although containing a couple of very interesting screws, is essentially like any other heist movie we've all seen before (you already know the conclusion and you always wonder where they magically get all that military level kit from). The fight scenes have obvious outcomes, the alliances of certain characters are openly questionable and the character of Matt Schulze (Vince) is more pointless than jet skiing in your 15 meter, back garden swimming pool.The UNENDING swarms of mind-blowingly beautiful women and roaring hot cars are haplessly missing in the trial to create a more interesting storyline, which has only lead to needless additions into the story which add nothing to the overall plot. This movie is like a man in his late 20's desperate to become something more yet hold onto his youth and ending up messing up on both fronts. There's a token nitrous moment amidst the scores of needless carnage and overflowing testosterone levels from the tanking cast and developments in Brian and Mia's relationship add nothing to the story.Overall, the movie is enjoyable but lacks the zing of maybe the first two. It falls short of a modern day epic man-movie like the ""expendables"" and clearly lacks the strong storyline and acting prowess of a brilliant modern day heist movie like ""the bank job"". Saying that, it would still be a shame to miss this movie.",Fast Five

Despite the same cliché that comes up in each film, an unexpected ending would bring the film to an exceptional end!

I will admit, the scene they did while towing the vault was way too far fetched for me, but then again, that's what they do best. The one thing that this movie was missing, was ""Letty"". Those of you know she died during the last Fast & Furious sequel. She made a perfect balance to Dominic's roughness. I wasn't too surprised to see Vin Diesel's name as producer since I believe he produced the last one. They also gave us a ""wide-open"" ending to make FF-6. Can they do another good one?

229,SkidMcCormick,Just Ate my Own Words.,9,7 May 2011,"The 1970 trailer for the biker classic, Hell's Belles summed it up perfectly: ""Hip chicks with an itch for the kind of action that takes a lot of man﻿ to scratch!"" That same mentality prevails in all of the F&F series and as I've always said before: If it ain't broke, don't fix it.In my Thor review, I slated Fast Five without seeing it; and now, I stand here before my legion of fans, holding my head (and spiky bonce) in shame. They say that no one talks about Fight Club, true. But when it's Fast & Furious, remember one thing: Leave your brain at home and set your motor to auto-cruise. Hey, I'm even 100% sure that NASA's finest could figure out the logistics and physics of cutting open the side of a fast moving train, but this is what F5 does: It's so ludicrous that you just have to give up and suspend disbelief until you come back to reality (haha, I made an Inception joke there, nice!) Fast Five does what it says on the poster and doesn't allow you to breathe a lot. Within 5 mins of the opening scene, we see Vin Diesel's Dom, being rescued by his family (whilst he's in a moving prison vehicle no less!) And a credit to the writers, they shift gears as quickly as they can and take us to Rio De Janeiro (yes, not a CGI city, but actually Rio, no orange Macaws plugging 3G crap, thank God!) What we then get after, is a fairly sane plot of a corrupt official Reyes (the always cool Joaquin De Almeida) who seems to have more money than God. After this Kingpin kills a member of the wannabe Ocean's 11 crew, Dominic wants revenge as only he knows how! Except, he didn't bargain on Special FBI bounty hunter, Hobbs (Dwayne The Rock Johnson). As Paul Walker's Brian O'Conner says: ""Vey Old Testament"". Say what you like about wrestlers-cum-actors, but DJ is better than 50 Cent, in that he actually took acting lessons and is the best thing about F5. In fact, Vin Diesel has been in this franchise for a while now, and wisely takes a back seat for the Rock and his motormouth do the talking. And this is what I liked: We're promised a showdown with 2 behemoths (albeit 3, if you count Vin's belly). While I do like the Bourne films, those frigging quick cuts in the action is off putting; but here, Justin Lin keeps it old school and even out does the Expendables and its constant clumsiness, by giving us a solid beat-down between the Tooth Fairy & XXX. It's A-Team style, punch-em-in-the-face with no suplex in-jokes. The Rock is in phenomenal shape and twice the size of Diesel (I for one, cannot wait until 2012 when he does a one-off reunion with WWE and takes out John Cena!) The women in F&F have 2 purposes: They're good wheel drivers and wield wrenches for self-defense. On the other hand, the ones who aren't allowed to speak on camera, simply let their finely tuned asses and over-the-crotch hot pants do the talking (not that I'm complaining you understand)...Gisele (Gal Gadot) is a skinny chick with balls and needs to eat more burgers if she wants to convince Sports Illustrated, she can cut it on their front cover. Elsa ""Tacky"" Pataky is good as Elena, the cop with a ""nice smile"" and wished she'd been in a bikini instead. But as always, my heart goes to Jordana Brewster as Mia. She'll never win an Oscar (like she gives a rat's ass!) but remains as beautiful as ever (and appeared in season 2 of Chuck, so clearly she has taste).There was great interplay with the rest of the cast too, especially with Roman (Tyrese Gibson) and Tej (Chris Bridges) and their schoolboy put downs. And with a movie that takes itself seriously with action and very little CGI, a smattering of humour is always welcome in my books.A few observations I noticed: Had Dominic Toretto and his motley crew watched Top Gear UK, they would've known that a TVR is the only car that could beat a speed camera (duh!) Also, don't even tell me that no-one has played Modern Warfare 2, because anyone who has (veteran, cough!) will be familiar with the Favela chapter and here, it's brought to the screen with some real ferocity, right down to the roof top chases. And just to reinforce the demographic F5 is aimed out, look no further than Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit, which they clearly emulated in the last 20 mins. And there were 2 other moments I cried (the first being Elena) - Mia driving a GT40 and Dom's 1970 Charger getting crushed (noooooo!) And if you're going to acquire the top sports car in the Western Hemisphere, at least have the decency to grace us with a band of attractive women to double the viewing pleasure! As my good American cyber friend Ashley said: ""Stick around after the end credits"". F&F6 is on the cards; but F5 could've tied-up its loose ends very neatly. I gave this movie 5/5 because it's F for Fun and after you leave, you'll think you've just been on the best amusement park ride, ever! Whether Justin Lin is the right man for the Terminator reboot is debatable - (don't get me wrong, I'm happy for the Far East Asian brother to hit the big time, and that Sung Kan gets a love interest who's out of his race!) but if Justin himself can contact me, we need to sit down and do some serious talking!",Fast Five
230,Generic_Gooner,"Dumb, over the top and stretching every ounce of suspension of belief at times... but what did you expect from this franchise?",7,17 July 2011,"I will start with the overall statement to sum this film up within the franchise... Its the best of the five in my opinion.I could easily go to town on the film and reel off a list of elements that would be considered negative for this film, such as clichéd dialogue and outlandish scenes that ask you to suspend belief in reality to avoid finding more holes than a sieve.But why should i have to? This is what i would call a 'dumb summer blockbuster', a little slice of escapism and within a genre (action) that doesn't need to play it safe or play it to total reality. The dialogue will have you either grinning at the cheese of it all or putting your head in your hands at times, but if these meat headed characters had said it any more eloquently you wouldn't buy into the persona of who they are portraying. Dwayne Johnson's character of Hobbs is the stand out one, having all the best quotable lines and playing the super cop who is by the book to the bitter end as well as any you might have seen before. He is the rival to the untouchable anti hero character of Dom that Vin Deisel has growled for every film up to this point. You are meant to not hate Hobbs but at the same time i found an unintentional element of him having the funnier lines and being so over the top was that i was rooting for him over Dom and the gang at times! Now what i think must be noted is that when the franchise began it was simply a 'fast cars' film, very 2 dimensional but functional in its delivery. And while it didn't need 5 films in its run to have made it to the 5th film there was no way they could have flogged the same idea over and over and hope for the best. I applaud the thought process with the script to try and change settings and plot details, even though some of the films didn't work, and by raising the stakes in the jeopardy for the characters makes more sense as they seemingly try to top the last storyline. They have unfortunately by having this mini renaissance within the franchise not taken it as a good last hurrah to their story,going out on a high, and now think the franchise has new life to churn out another with the characters that dragged this film up from mediocre to fun entertainment. Had they stopped there they might have got away with it. While i cant predict the outcome of the 6th film, i do fear they will over emphasise the unintentionally successful parts of fast five and ruin both films in the process.But for now at least, an enjoyable 7/10",Fast Five
231,Affirmative_Dave,"Finally, a good F&F",8,19 February 2012,"I watched the first Fast and Furious, a few years ago (2001), and was very disappointed. This was the typical arrogant action-i-am-stronger-than-you-bunch-of-high-fives-with- muscular-hands-absent-script movie. For me, the F&F series would end at that number one.But yesterday, intrigued by the 7.3 IMDb rating of F&F 5, I decided to give that movie a chance. And... action, action and action. Nicely done. Beautiful, amazing and, even, the unexpected: the movie has a lot of originality!The first action scene is absolutely fantastic, and literally breathtaking. And the one near the end... I can just say amazing... while I'd like so much to talk about it - but this comment would be flagged as spoiler. Not only that scene belongs to the ""never seen before"" category, but also it was filmed from the right angles, and it looks real (maybe it is!).The script is not from Agatha Christie, of course, and one may anticipate and guess some of the developments during the movie, find a few plot holes, but, clearly, this is not what you want from the movie. It is more than watchable thanks to the amazing action scenes, and the brilliant making that seized the most from those scenes.Finally, Brazil, the Brazilians and the Favelas add a lot to the atmosphere, colors and photography. This is also why the movie looks ""different"".If you need to get some more energy, to get 120% woken up, ready to run / work / whatever, watch that movie ; this is far more efficient than an energy drink!",Fast Five

More or less you know what's gonna happen at the end but there are key facts that this movie is a successor. The direction of the film is great, even in the most unrealistic scenes you can feel the tense in which case you feel certain that you're actually physically there. I think that the fun part begins on the second half of the movie. And of course I must not forget to mention the epic fight between Luke Hobbs ""The Rock"" & Vin Diesel ""XXX"". (I wish Luke Hobbs wore less Sun Tanning Lotion & Baby-Oil. A personal remark to Mr Hobbs: ""You look too shiny dude.. relax!! We know you got muscles!"").

In fact, I found it to be better than some of its predecessors.Fast Five has a great cast of misfits and they all come together nicely in this flick. This movie is very fast moving and doesn't waste a second jumping into the plot. Fast Five has a great combination of action, light humor, and even a wee-bit of suspense.I did find this movie to be highly predictable though, and unfortunately, this was not ""The Rock's"" best work.

I thought Fast & Furious was the best of the franchise, but Fast Five has completely blown all of its predecessors out of the water! Despite it completely breaking all laws of physics (especially including a scene where a small muscle car manges to trip a bus over) the movie was awesome. This makes a Fast and the Furious movie worth watching! Being a huge fan, I loved this movie to death.Never has a movie made me sweat in the theater seat and pump me full of so much adrenaline that I almost peed my pants.They drive a SAFE through the STREET!The other awesome part of this film is that it's a Fast and the Furious movie with a story and more depth to the characters. The previous movies were meant solely for their action and this one does that, too... Plus some more!I got the honorable pleasure to see this pulse pounding film in IMAX and it was worth every cent. I suggest that, for the full effect, you see it in IMAX as well. This is the pure testosterone of 2011. 2010 had The Expendables and 2008 had Rambo, now Sylvester has met his match, and his name is Justin Lin.",Fast Five

It's action packed with a reasonably credible story line. I did find myself thinking that all the dialog scenes seemed so serious, like; ""I'm going to the bathroom, who's in?"" cut to other person ""Let's do it"". or ""I'm going to have fish for lunch""....""go for it"". But, that is the nature of a movie that is trying to pack a lot into one movie. Also, I liked how they didn't explain everything - instead of my thinking ""how did they do that?"" it was just done. This movie is definitely fast and fun. And I would think seeing it in the theater is ideal",Fast Five
236,English-Class2014,"Fast cars, fast drifts, hot women and many action scenes.",9,13 April 2014,"Fast cars, fast drifts, hot women and many action scenes. If that is what you like, Justin Lin's movie Fast and Furious 5, released in 2011 with Vin Diesel, Paul Walker and Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson in the leading roles is the right choice for you. The movie starts with a continued scene from Fast and Furious 4, in which Dominic 'Dom' Toretto (Vin Diesel) is freed out of a prison bus by his friend Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) and his sister Mia Toretto (Jordana Brewster). Because the three are wanted now, they escape to the Favelas in Rio de Janeiro. Dom's brother Vince wants them to help him to steal cars out of a train. During this theft, the gang around Dominic Toretto shoots two CIA agents who guarded the cars. In one of the stolen cars, a Ford GT40, Dom Toretto finds a chip with a map of all the places in which Rio de Janeiro's biggest gangster, Reyes, hid his money. That is why Favela gangsters want Toretto and Co. to be killed. But also the CIA, led by Special Agent Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson), wants them to be imprisoned, because of the two agents they killed. Because Toretto and Co. know where all the money is hidden, they attack one of the places and burn all the 10 million dollars hidden there. Doing this, they hope that Reyes will bring all his money (100.000.000 $) to one place. The aim is to attack this one place and to get the 100 million dollars to buy their liberty. This movie is really exciting because of all the action scenes. All the actors do a really good job and, of course, they all drive great cars. But you can still laugh in this movie. Furthermore, the sound track of Fast and Furious 5 'Danza Kuduro' is a great work by Don Omar. by André A., Stefan D. and Tom K.",Fast Five
237,seanbreeden,Can I have my 2 hours back?,1,23 November 2011,"Definitely in the bottom 3 movies I have seen. I'm a Vin Diesel fan all the way back to Multi-Facial. I liked Pitch Black and Chronicles of Riddick along with just about everything else he's done. Even the first Fast & Furious was a good action movie. Hell, I even liked XxX! This one was pretty bad.I try to have suspension of disbelief when I watch anything but I just couldn't enjoy this movie due to all of the strange character development and plot holes. I know a lot of people really like this movie (including my brother who said it was one of the best movies he's seen -- gonna have a talk with him) but it just wasn't my cup of tea.If you like the F&F movies then you should see this one. If not, then move along and find something better to watch. When I checked IMDb for this movie prior to getting it the rating was 7.4. This is one of the rare times that IMDb's ratings have let me down.Overall the acting was horrible, the plot was bad, the action sequences were hard to follow, and the characters really weren't likable. I saw on IMDb that they're making F&F6... Why? Were there that many unanswered questions from the first 5? Make Riddick 3 or Iron Giant 2 instead!!",Fast Five

240,tfbowler314,the best fast and furious movie so far,9,4 September 2011,"This was the best Fast and Furious movie I have ever seen. The action-packed scenery was out of this world. It was pretty clever of Dom and his gang to slip past those cops. I think that street race that Dom and his racing buddies would go 1/4 mile for $1,000,000 while driving police cars. That scene when Dom and Brian were driving while having a safe attached to the back of their cars was so funny.It was awesome to bring all the previous cast members from the Fast and the Furious, 2 Fast 2 Furious, and Fast and Furious and ban them together to take on Hobbs, Dwayne Johnson, who was the bad boy to take Dom and the rest of the racers down.Dwayne Johnson played an excellent job being the Head Cop. His character, Hobbs is someone no one wants to fool around with.As for Vince, I thought he was gonna betray Dom by bringing him in to the cops. He seemed like he couldn't be trusted.Vin Diesel and Paul Walker make a perfect partnership for these movies that will literally DRIVE YOU WILD.For the special effects, they were incredible for my ears. I love listening to the sounds of explosions, gun shots and car crashes.The only scene I find ironic was when Dom saved Hobbs' life so he (Hobbs) joined forces with Dom's gang. Vin Diesel vs Dwayne Johnson was a bloodbath match. I hope this movie wins a few Oscars. It was stupendous.",Fast Five
241,rockchester,Action Adventure Movie Worth Watching,9,20 December 2012,"I'm not a movie critic. I know what I like. And this movie is, without a doubt, very well done. The action is top shelf, the pace is fast and unrelenting, the cars and women are stunning and there isn't a single character, even the villain, who is truly despicable. That is, everyone in the movie is likable and watchable.It was great to see Dwayne Johnson (The Rock) playing somewhat of a bad guy but he's also one of the good guys. Being a fan of Clear and Present Danger, I was a little disappointed that Joaquim de Almeida's role wasn't more prominent but it is, essentially, an ensemble cast that is fun to watch. Definitely a movie worth watching and there isn't much of a lull anywhere in the movie to allow for a quick run to the bathroom so make sure you're familiar with the pause button's location on your remote.",Fast Five
242,Kungloa,Undeniably awesome.,8,8 May 2011,"I dare anyone to name the 4th sequel of a franchise (not based on previously known material) that is actually considered a decent movie on it's own? That's right, if there are any, I doubt it's more than a handful.But to call this a decent movie is a gross understatement. If looked at for pure entertainment value, this is probably one of the best action movies I have seen in the last 5 years. You can call the whole thing over-the-top, I don't care, to be honest, that would also be an understatement.The thing is, every movie, even bad ones have a redeeming factor to them. Either it's a certain actor's performance, a unique story or brisk visuals. With this franchise it's always been about cars, babes and action. And it handles the action so exceedingly well this time around that you forget the cheesy moments, you forget you're at the movies, it's like you're right in the middle of it, from the very start.No doubt the cars are beautiful, the girls are gorgeous and the acting is exactly what you would expect. But the story actually has a subplot which gives the movie more emotional depth. Money and freedom is the motivator for these guys, but by doing what they do best they aren't just fighting for their own freedom. This is touched upon a couple of times and it gives the story a good moral boost.And if there isn't something being completely demolished on the big screen it's the trash-talking that keeps the pace at a high level. Laughter guaranteed.I can't recommend this movie enough for action junkies or people who just want to have a good time at the cinema. So if this hasn't been enough...Picture Ocean's Eleven, now think cars, Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson and a lot of eye-popping violence.Yeah that should do it.",Fast Five
243,electrablind,Mildly interesting heist film,5,29 April 2011,"thefilmsmith.com If you're a film critic aiming to be taken seriously you draw up reviews of awesome little-known films like Night of the Hunter and level sniper shots at the latest Transfomers flick. Anything heavily marketed to mass audiences is normally regarded as terrible before official screenings begin, and that sentiment isn't without its reasons. But even the most erudite critic has a guilty pleasure, and mine happens to be any film that tries to do as much real special effect work as possible before going to the computer, which is what made me curious about Fast Five.Paul Walker and Vin Diesel return to the franchise that launched their careers, this time hiding in Rio de Janeiro when a 100 million dollar heist presents itself.Despite featuring characters who are notable only for their attractiveness and angry faces, this 2 hour heist film manages to milk some character development. Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson hams it up nicely as the DEA agent chasing Vin Diesel and Paul Walker, and Walker is mercifully not given many lines. Instead, director Justin Lin introduces the characters with an impressive train heist and incorporates quieter moments that don't clash with the rest of the film.The actual heist sequence illustrated in the film's trailer is what intrigued me, but within the film it's delivered with mixed results. A scrapyard somewhere made a killing off the film, with plenty of vehicles getting mashed, crashed, and thrashed with nary a digital effect interrupting the fiasco (at least blatantly; it definitely played a supporting role). Kudos. After a while though, the auto body kill count becomes numbing and never manages to deliver a cherry on top of this metal mash-up sundae (think the truck flip from The Dark Knight).Despite being the fifth sequel in a car racing franchise that still bears of the scars of its adolescence, it isn't a bad action film. Sure, the film has some bad moments (it still retains its awkward homoerotic tension between angry ogre men), but overall it's bearable.If you're interested in the film's special effects, it might be worth your time. Other than that, I'm not sure why else someone would want to see it. Vin Diesel's shiny head? -Remington Smith",Fast Five

We had an absolute blast! I really dig the Fast and Furious franchise for it's fantastic mix of fast cars, pretty ladies, crazy stunts, fun action, cheesy dialogue and acting, and sense of family! This movie takes all of that and just cranks it up!Picking up exactly where the last film ended, Fast Five continues the story with Dom, Brian, and Mia on the run in Rio. This time, they are being hunted by Hobbs, played by the huge and highly enjoyable Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson. The tension in this pick is crazy! His fight scene with Dom is definitely one to remember! Many characters from the previous four movies are also in this one! Great idea, filmmakers! This movie is kinda like Ocean's Eleven with cars and you can tell the people making these films are having a blast. The actions scenes in this one are wild! Justin Lin shoots his action clearly- no endless shaky cam! The vault-dragging scene is ridiculously sweet and one of my favorite scenes from the series! The train sequence rocks too! There's also hand-to-hand combat, shootouts, chases. Don't forget a ton of humor and each character has a moment to shine. The chemistry between the cast is fantastic. They are one big epic family. I like how these movies maintain a continuity between films (nice to see Vince in there.Fast Five is a highly enjoyable, action film with some truly awesome action, comedy, drama, suspense!

246,jeffro517-783-121956,One of the better films in the series.,6,19 October 2013,"Finally a film from this series that's Fast and Furious all at once. Recently released on DVD and Blu-Ray this film brings together Paul Walker and Vin Diesel in the fifth film of the series. In addition to actors from the other films in the series this film also introduces Dwayne Johnson in a new role.The Fast and the Furious series is one that hasn't required a lot of attention to enjoy. The cars are cool and the action is great, the plots are generally weak but sufficient to embody the action people come to see. This film seems to be leveling off the quality of the story with the incredible action. The stunt work and special effects are the best by far of all the films.The story finds Brian O'Conner (Walker) and Dominic Toretto (Diesel) together again after Dominic escapes from prison with the help of his friends. this time they're in for one last score before they fade away into hiding. When the score goes bad they find themselves calling on their old friends to join them for revenge. They're up against a powerful and corrupt business man (Joaquim de Almeida) and a daring federal agent (Johnson). The action is great and the story is well done in this fifth film.Sure this isn't an Academy Award winner or anything, but it's a series that has grown up with this film. I would definitely crown this as the best film in the series. The acting is good and the soundtrack provides a great backdrop for the action. Still the star of the show is the action. It's visually exciting and filled with over-the-top action sequences. I would definitely recommend seeing this film if you've enjoyed the others. It's also great on its own since it only loosely relies on the previous films. I would give this a 3.1 out of 5 stars.",Fast Five

I'm not a big fan of the FF franchise and wasn't too excited to see this one, but thankfully this was different (and got treated to free tickets). I enjoyed the story a lot, thought the acting from every character was decent and the comedy were used at the right moments. Don't know about anyone else but the film reminded me a lot of Ocean's 11 in terms of the plot with the objective of pulling off ""one last"" job/heist. The elaborate planning to pull it off wasn't over the top, matter of fact I don't think it even went down the way they originally planned it due to unforeseen circumstances but nothing seemed ""off"" with how the film progressed. Only gripe I have, if any, is the cliché rich villain who seemingly has the entire police force in his payroll. A lot of viewers started walking out when the credits start rolling but I recommend you stay (ala Iron Man). No, Samuel L. Jackson/Nick Fury won't appear trying to recruit Dom into the Avengers, but it does have an interesting twist that suggest there could be a 6th film.

It's a nice change of pace from the previous films where it abandons the street race angle (how far could you have taken that anyway?) and goes into the direction of a heist action flick with cars. Dwayne Johnson is a great addition and really adds to the series embracing the goofiness of its premise. So yeah, still the best this franchise had, and that's kind of rare for a franchise on its fifth film. The action for the most part is really handled well and a lot of fun to watch. The cast as an ensemble are very charismatic which no doubt makes it more fun for audiences to see a cast that has so much diversity and it's not done with generic stereotypes but just a bunch of people with a common interest. Overall a very entertaining action flick.",Fast Five
252,TheDarkKnight21,"Too Stupid, Too Fun",7,22 May 2011,"Some films can be so idiotic that an audience will become insulted by their ineptitude (see The Last Airbender or Sucker Punch). But some films can be so idiotic that an audience will start giggling at how ridiculous the whole thing can be. Thankfully, the fifth outing in the decade-old Fast and Furious franchise falls in the latter category as an enjoyable, popcorn-munching thrill ride.The film begins with where the last one left off: Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) is carted off to jail but is busted en route to prison by his sister Mia (Jordana Brewster) and her boyfriend / Dom's now friendly rival, Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker). After escaping the US, the trio find themselves in Brazil but end up pissing off the kingpin of the favelas in Rio, Hernan Reyes (Joaquin de Almeida). Even with a brutal DSS agent (The Rock) on their tail, the Torettos and O'Connor decide to get back at Reyes and pull off a heist with a cash winnings of $100 million. So they recruit nearly all their friends from the previous four movies (including Ludicrous, Tyrese Gibson, Don Omar, Sung Kang, Matt Schulze, Tego Calderon, Gal Gadot) to ban together and pull off an insane robbery plan.From this little plot summary, you can already tell this is really not the most serious action film out there. And thankfully, the actors and director do not take it so seriously either, that they start to have so much fun with what they have. It does seem that the film tries a little too hard to make you like your main characters even though they are all thieves. For instance, Dom is frequently portrayed as a church-going, fiercely loyal friend despite being able to wreck anybody that gets in his way. But it's par for the course and it allows to confidently root for him and his team, even when their villain is so cartoonishly evil that he can't be taken seriously. But as I said, seriousness is not the order of the day. Fun is all there is on the menu, and the actors are able to support that fun just the same. The dialogue is peppered with pretty silly lines for the three leads, but they each deliver them with such deadpan seriousness that you almost begin to wonder if they are intentionally trying to make you laugh. However, the dialogue does fall flat many times, and I was kind of hoping with such a ridiculous premise that dialogue could keep up with it. Sadly, that didn't happen. The middle of the film also drags on a bit with a notable lack of action, but this is made up with some funny exchanges between the characters who have some great chemistry.Meanwhile Tyrese Gibson and Ludicrous have fun exchanges throughout the film, as do Don Omar and Tego Calderon. Gal Gadot and Matt Schulze don't add much to the mix, but they're fine with what they are given. I was really wishing to see more of Sung Kang as Han from Fast and Furious 3: Tokyo Drift (the ONLY good part about the movie), but even he delivers some fun lines as well. But no exchange was making my audience crack up more than watching The Rock and Vin Diesel trying to out-Man the other guy. Even more so when their big fist fight in the film disregards physics.Speaking of which, I'm pretty sure the director, Justin Lin, must really enjoy flicking off pictures of Isaac Newton, because physics do not exist in this world. In this film, he has two guys drive off a steep cliff into a river and somehow survive the impact of the fall and bare men can break through the walls of favelas. The film then leads to a spectacular sequence involving two cars dragging a large safe through the streets of Rio while using it as a wrecking ball against their pursuers. It gets so ridiculous that it achieves the Bad Boys 2 effect: a film that is so aware that it's dumb, that it becomes a fun ride for all. While Fast Five cannot be called a great film with hokey dialogue and some flat characters, it does manage to entertain its audiences with the cast having great chemistry and over-the-top stunts leading the way throughout the film. Give it a look if you have an afternoon free, and enjoy the ride.",Fast Five

255,TheTVSamurai,Fast Five Blu-Ray Review,8,25 January 2012,"It was quite serendipitous that I caught Fast Five in the theatres. There were over ten of us planning to go watch the much-talked-about Bridesmaids but when my car group got there (late), we had three friends trying to save like 15 seats on a long weekend—wasn't happening. There were still seats left in the first few rows of the theatre but I'd personally rather not watch the movie if I had to strain my neck for 2 hours and potentially feel sick. So me and a buddy volunteered to leave the group and go watch another flick that was airing around the same time. And that's how I ended up sitting (in very decent seats) in the cinema showing Fast Five.Fast Five is the latest instalment to the ""Fast"" movie series and the third film of the franchise directed by Justin Lin (Fast & Furious, Tokyo Drift). I have to say that Lin has successfully revived this series that I thought was over and done with, when the Diesel-less 2 Fast and 2 Furious came out. The director has managed to not only revive the series but has been able to evolve it into a franchise he can call his own now. It's been over a decade since the first film came out and Fast Five comes full circle and basically pays homage to all the previous movies with almost all the ""Fast"" characters coming back (some characters meeting for the first time)—it feels like one big high school reunion.The story takes off exactly right where the 4th film left off, where, Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker, Takers) and Mia Toretto (Jordana Brewster, Fast & Furious) are going to rescue Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel, who's also the producer of the film)—in very appropriate ""Fast"" style—from the prison bus. They end up in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil where they plan to pull one last job, a big heist which involves taking $100 million dollars from a drug kingpin and his army of corrupt cops. All this, while being hunted down by a bad ass DSS federal agent, Agent Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson, who's last film is ironically entitled, Faster) and his crew.Continue reading the full 'Movie Review' and 'Blu-Ray Review' at: http://www.thetvsamurai.com/2011/10/fast-five-blu-ray-review.html",Fast Five

The main point of this movie was to cause massive destruction everywhere they went. Cops and FBI agents help with break in, jumping off roofs with zero injuries, easy and unexplainable access to top security and weaponry, etc. but on a good note, I like the cast and I was honestly not expecting the empty vault.",Fast Five
257,Dschadir,AWESOME! That's all I can say.,9,7 May 2011,"AWESOME! That's all I can say. The action is great, the story is great, the music is great, the cars are again out of this world (ok, not really :-)), the character interaction and character development are great and just as in part 1, it's the 'team' that makes the movie for me. A team which I as a viewer want to be a part of.Where they started falling into the sequel trap with releasing sub-par movies after the first one, come part 4 they completely turned it around. By bringing back the original cast and by adding some much needed character development and 'real' characters they instantly created a blockbuster hit. And now part 5 is even better imho. They expanded on the back stories of the characters and the story of the movie as a whole. A story which I believe is better than the fourth movie and even rivals the first one. Keep in mind though that we are still not talking about Oscar material, but as a summer, sorry ... spring :-), blockbuster it comes highly recommended.If they continue like this I definitely wouldn't mind if they made 5 more of these.",Fast Five

Besides these little quibbles, I have never seen a movie where they used so little actual real natives. They only used Rio as a backdrop and huge set, clearing the streets almost completely for all the scenes. But now that I think about it, that was the way all of the movies have been made. Tokyo drifts main Japanese protagonists were all either mixed or Korean!",Fast Five
259,e_blastman,"Best of the ""Fast"" Series",10,9 November 2011,"Fast Five is a terrific action movie with a well written script. The action scenes are the best in the entire Fast series and I rate the Fast Five a solid 10 stars. For sheer thrills and edge of your seat action don't miss this movie. Romance is kept to a minimum, a must for action movies, and the next chase, gun fight etc. is just a couple minutes away. The 110 minutes on the screen went by in a flash, another indication of how great this movie is. I've been to movies where 2 hours seem like 2 days. D Johnson really held up his part of the movie and was very believable in his DSS (FBI) like role. BTW I usually don't rate the movies I really like above a 7 or 8 stars, but Fast Five deserves the entire ammo belt load of 10 stars. If you like action pics (duh who doesn't) SEE THIS MOVIE!",Fast Five
260,ducon4,Just awful,3,12 March 2012,"I don't even know if we can call it cinema. This is full of cliché (sex, money, women, big cars, muscles, American imperialism etc..) and action scenes totally surrealistic. And once again the Americans think they can go in a foreign country and rule as if they were back home. I mean by that when the American police crew, led by the Rock, arrive in Brazil they behave like they have jurisdiction and an authority there... They come in and talk like xxxx to the Brazilian police and start giving orders all around (in a foreign country, like if it's even remotely possible). Only Americans can like this kind of thing and not find it suspicious. I'm not even gonna start with the actions scenes or the scenario which are like bad science fiction or I could write 10 pages.

Every moment in the scenes you really believed that this was real and the greatness of this movieThe Plot: Was amazing with plenty of twists and turns leaving you in laughter at every end and wondering how they can created a fifth sequel and still make it this brilliant the answer this is something that can just continue and with brilliant director and writers.

263,Zephyr75,All in all not a bad movie at all,8,7 October 2011,"Well I waited until the movie actually came on DVD to view this movie. Being that I have pretty good surround sound I felt that I could get the same effect sound-wise if the action was good. Well I must say my sound system got quite the workout. I quite expected the movie to pick up exactly where it left off with part 4. Then the story moves into territory I thought it would. The only thing I can fault the movie on is predictability. You could see where the movie was going a mile away. Then when they get the ""crew"" together I figured right away that they were going for the whole (Ocean's Eleven) angle. Especially when the climatic ending comes into play. I had it quite figured out by time it was all over with. I just wished they made the so called 'villian' in this movie a little more 'villanous'. But like I said, overall though this isn't a bad movie at all. It is definitely an adrenaline rush of a movie. At first I thought the stunts would look over the top cheesy, but they were actually pretty good and packed with good intensity. The climatic chase sequence definitely looked a bit more realistic than the climatic car chase in part 4, which I was glad about. All the characters worked really well together as well, and you can tell just how much their chemistry has grown through the years. They definitely play well off one another.",Fast Five
264,petailss,"good, but not the best...",7,12 November 2011,"The expectation is always great when is a film in the franchise F&F. All previous films were great, could not be different with ""Fast 5"". Yeah, it has many unrealistic scenes, but what makes this movie good are these exaggerated as the final scenes, where Brian and Don hold a multi-ton safe in their cars. The performances were great, as always, and the soundtrack is another great thing in the film. One of the few things I dislike in the plot was this not to be the last film in the franchise. Had a great end. But instead, we find something else to make a new movie. A good idea with the return of a character lost, but that could have been discarded. With a few races, forget it if expected a movie full of speed as 2 Fast 2 Furious. But for fans, it's a good chance to see three movie stars in action in a single movie.",Fast Five
265,jibalis,Getting whole crew together - awesome idea,10,29 April 2012,"I had quite high expectations about this movie. And they paid of even more that I thought.I thought that getting all awesome guys from previous movies was great idea. Like Han from ""Tokyo Drift"" alone made this movie much, much better for me just with his appearance. I also very enjoyed Roman's appearance as I really liked him in ""2 Fast 2 Furious"" (much peoples say it's lame, but I think it was a great entertainment)and he was pretty cool in here too, tough a lil bit too negative. I didn't really remember Gisele and these two Dominicans Tego and Rico. But I guess, they were from ""Fast & Furious"". I have seen it only once, so I don't really remember any second plan characters. These guys however were great too. I loved these two Dominicans arguing. Now finally about the movie. Well I loved it from first minutes till last seconds. It was full of tense action. Much more than in previous parts. What I didn't like was, that there were no street races in this one. I guess that bit where Han, Dom, Brian and Rom were racing betting 1 million each, can't actually be counted. I also didn't like Vince's appearance. I disliked him at first movie and don't think he was necessary at this one. Dwayne's Johnson's appearance was great too, because I very like some of his movies (Scorpion king, Welcome to the jungle). The plot. I liked it. It weren't too advanced and some people might call it unrealistic and lame, but, come on, it's an action movie! In summary I can say, this movie was one of greatest F&F franchise movies, if not the greatest. I hope to see whole gang together also for the next, because mostly that made this movie so awesome. 9/10",Fast Five
266,namsu22,Potentially billions in economic costs,4,25 September 2011,"I have been an ardent fan of each Fast and Furious. I watch them with the knowledge (and hope) that they will be corny, cheesy, etc. Thats the fun of Fast and Furious Franchise. This franchise had the potential to be the best fast and furious yet, with people from each movie making appearances. What this movie lacked was what all the others have, there were no in depth scenes outlining the underground culture of brazil, barely and race scenes, and the storyline was too cliché (even for my taste).Forget all that, and lets think about something else. Throughout the movie (especially the entire ending) innocent individuals HAD to be killed. This movie glorify's being a bone head and killing innocent civilians. It promises that great rewards will come to those who take extraordinary risks without care to the adverse effects on the population. Assume the following, this movie will (through all forms of syndication) reach 50,000,000 people. Of those, this will have a defining influence on at least 5% of impressionable individuals (a modest estimate. So these 2.5 million individuals instead of dedicating their time towards hard work and rigirous study they instead will choose a life of crime with the impossible dream of actually not going to prison. In terms of economic benefit to the country (or shall I say countries) this movie is worse then dropping an atomic bomb on a major metropolitan area. Fast and furious movies are supposed to be cheesy, but the cheesiness is only acceptable if accompanied by a view of a societys underculture and awesome racing scenes. This movie severely lacked both while managing to mislead the lives of several thousand (if not million) youth.",Fast Five
267,smvouriot,Fun action film (may contain spoilers),7,5 July 2012,"If you like your action movies realistic, I wouldn't recommend Fast Five to you. Although if you enjoy watching one preposterous action scene and stunt after another and don't care that the characters appear to be some kind of superhumans that evade machine gun fire effortlessly and are able to fall off massive cliffs and not sustain any injury then you will find yourself extremely well rewarded.Fast Five is an expertly made and shot action film. I said expertly shot because unlike most action movies these days the cinematography is not shaky and you get a real sense of the fight choreography and stunt driving. Also, some recent action films are cut so quickly that it all just looks like an incomprehensible mess. Thankfully, Fast Five isn't like that either.Fast Five is most unlike a Fast and Furious film. Previous films in the series were about street racing and infiltrating the criminal underworld whereas this one is more of a heist movie on the lines of the Oceans Eleven films. I haven't seen the the first three ""F and F"" films all the way through but I've seen enough of them on TV to get a feel for what they're like. The fourth film ""Fast and Furious"" was OK but didn't leave a huge impression on me. Fast Five, however, is five times better in almost every way (well, the acting is still pretty basic with the actors doing what they're required to do and nothing more). I gotta admit though, the arrival of Dwayne Johnson into this franchise as tough agent Hobbs has also been a noticeable improvement.The best dialogue scenes in the movie are between Hobbs and Dom Toretto(Vin Diesel). The two also have a crazy smackdown together which, after the final vault chase, is the movies best scene. Now I'll go as far as to say that the vault chase is probably one of the best chase sequences I've ever seen. I don't want to give too much away because I want to encourage you to watch this film and see why most critics and fans are giving this positive reviews.However, like I said at the beginning of the review if you like realistic action films like the Jason Bourne films you probably won't enjoy this as much. Although, if you don't care that the main characters would probably be dead by the 20 minute mark in the film in real life then you will be extremely well rewarded.Fast Five dosen't try to be realistic. It knows its absurd and dosen't take itself too seriously. For the people with broader imaginations for preposterous stunts you will have a fun time. Who cares if everything in this movie is impossible? its only a movie",Fast Five
268,Instantdeath,Stop making these! Please,1,23 April 2011,"OK, You know when you're in trouble when the die hard F&F fans behind you burst into hysterical laughter at the movie's very first stunt, but then again,so did the whole cinema.This film is the classic metaphor for the postmodern tripe that Hollywood has had the misfortune of ever getting into bed with since Get Rich or Die Trying.....you'd think they would have taken a lesson.It also is the classic overly used unrealistic stunts, like the ones we would usually see in the 80's muscle films. Classic example, 5mins into the film, Vin Disiel drives a car off a train, but hits the ground square on the nose and you see the wheel buckling.......you blink and the car is back to pristine condition......? And it was boring, yes extremely boring, for a driving film, they're was about 15mins max, the rest seemed to concentrate on developing love interests and avoiding the occasional rabid mob.In this case - get cars, get paid and get lost................(that's pretty much how grammatically fluid the script was).Plot - Once AGAIN ex FBI agent and Vin Disiel go about looking for top of the range cars as they're still broke and off the Radar, only this time in Brazil, one last job etc etc etc. FBI sends they're best man, who happens to be a pro wrestler ( but out acts all in the film by a long shot) and his muscle bound team of trigger happy feds. But there's a Rio business man/gangster with all this cash just hanging about in safe houses (how convenient), which they proceed to rob. Yawn! There are many faults with this film, but my top 5 gripes are thus: 1. The script & dialogue. Seems to be written by a middle school kid who is flunking at English. 'You Family' 'We Hungry' ' did yo slap or tap that ...........eh? Excuse me? Scripts....and Films like this (using the term loosely) justify film piracy. If refunds where available, who honestly wouldn't demand one after this garbage.We get all the usual propaganda about how it funds terrorism and the other political mantras. This Film justifies the murder of cops, stealing cars and excruciatingly bad acting. Please can we have a law in the future which states that actors have to be part of the actors gild or trained to an acceptable standard ( by acceptable, not hitting out with this urban degeneration of English).2. The cops just switch sides.......yes the cops that have no other goal but to hunt down and bring these men to justice, just change sides and help the bad guys out...............seriously, now get lost. And more to the point, why does the female cop instantly fall head over heels for someone who is in the same circuit that killed her husband, I found it was cringe worthy as the two of them swaggered up to the beach house at the end.3. The 'we need a team to pull off this last job' Cant we make films about someones first job instead, its exemplifies the person who is sick of their day job, in this case, nicking cars and getting paid loads of cash.....but you can see the hypocrisy there. The team..........totally being ripped from Oceans 11 and Gone in 60 seconds films. The fringe characters from the previous F&F films, (I never did watch Toyko Drift so I didn't have a clue as to who the Japanese guy was. I can feel my blood pressure rising as I type.4. They manage to rob a police station with more troops on the ground than America has in Afghanistan and Iraq and not take one single causality. Dragging a 10 tonne high security safe along with two medium range size cars??????? Who the hell where the two Brazilian freaks who did...... well, what exactly? Jumped around spewing out jokes with would only appeal to someone with the IQ of a demented Badger. The indoor training to beat the cameras where they needed invisible cars. So the highest security office in Brazil doesn't realise that 4 of its muscle cars, ( yes that's right the Brazilian police instead of Fords have supped up NOS guzzling super cars as basic patrol vehicles) are missing? And then it transpires that they don't need them. But just to keep a low profile, they drag race them along Rio main intersection.......Yeah sure, trying to be inconspicuous.5. The big happy ending for everyone,......... laughable. Once again the cinema was in hysterics, not at the badly time jokes from Tyrese ' His agent should be shot for war crimes for introducing him to Hollywood' Gibson and his obvious comic relief character as, quite Frankly, no one can take him seriously. The Japanese guy and the ex-military bird just speeding around Germany in a super-car. The two Brazilians gambling in Monaco........For a team of people who wanted to just disappear, they managed to annihilate a whole squadron of police cars, assault Brazil's maximum security police station, destroy half of Rio, Kill about 40+ police officers and then for their retirement, buying the rarest cars in the world ( always the best way to lie low for a while)..........which government in the world wouldn't seriously just unleash the death squads against them after the above.???????

270,swmayer,Fast Five (or Ocean's Eleven with Dodge Chargers),7,1 May 2011,"By the time a franchise gets to its fifth film you're probably worried that the laws of entropy are in full effect, and for good reason. Outside of horror franchises, how many fifth films can you name that were anywhere close to as successful or entertaining as the original? Maybe it had to do with having low expectations (after all I've suffered through 2 Fast 2 Furious and have wiped all memory of The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift from my conscious mind) but Fast Five seriously struck me as a fun to watch, exciting and funny action flick.The basic premise is nothing new for a crime movie – bring in a team of the best in your field to split a multi-million dollar score that will allow for a cushy retirement from a life a crime. In this case, that score is to be had against the most powerful man in Rio de Janeiro.To accomplish the job, lifetime criminal Dominic Toretto and former federal agent Brian O'Conner bring in a team of all the best racers and specialists that they have met along the course of their illustrious careers. Characters like Vince, Gisele, Han, Roman, Tej and other favorites come out of the woodwork for the big score.Making that score becomes even more difficult when the United States government becomes involved and sends a ringer in to catch Dom and O'Conner. Agent Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) is a match for Dom in almost every way. He's big, determined, and has the resources of the U.S. Department of State, Diplomatic Security Service at his disposal. Hobbs commissions the aid of a rookie Rio cop named ElenaWith her help, Hobbs makes life for the Ocean's Eleven-esque crew even more difficult. A ray of hope for Dom and the others lies in Elena, the widow of a clean cop offed by Reyes before the start of the movie. Elena will come up against a choice of doing her job without question or taking a shot at helping the criminal crew make a score against Reyes.Aside from a fairly easy to follow plot this film has what you would expect, a solid soundtrack, good looking people in skimpy clothing, humor (though mostly as shallow as the human emotions portrayed) and, of course a barrage of fast cars in adrenaline charged chase and race scenes.If you've stuck with the F&F franchise, odds are you are wondering what sort of cars you can expect from the most recent installment. I doubt you'll be disappointed. Let's take a look at a few of the cars you'll see.Of course, Dom's immortal 1970 Dodge Charger is back, though in this setting it's forced to look a little less mean and impressive in order to stay under the radar. It's not the only Charger in the film – not by a long shot. Fast Five is filled with 2010 and 2011 Chargers (some realized as police vehicles and others are modified Chargers driven by Dom and O'Conner for the final heist). To round out the Dodge product placement was a 2010 Challenger.Many of the modern cars in the film were used by the team to try and beat a camera array in a parking garage and driven only on an indoor test track. It gave filmmakers a good excuse to run some modern, hairpin turn capable cars like a Porsche GT3, 2010 Subaru STi, Nissan 370z, and others across the screen. Additional modern cars include a Lexus LFA, 1996 Toyota Supra, and a Koenigsegg CCX.Classic car buffs have more to look forward to then Dom's Charger (a nice surprise after the NOS engine, rice-rocket sounding cars that have come to symbolize the franchise). Though the screen-time is brief, we see some work done with a '66 GT40, '66 Corvette Grand Sport, and quite a few other 60s and 70s muscle cars. Motorcycles weren't left out either as a real hot Ducati Street Racer (with a real hot Gal Godot on the throttle) makes an appearance.If your taste in cars is at all similar to my own, you might find yourself drooling over Hobbs' government issued SUV that looks like a gorgeous, khaki-colored, utilitarian, armored behemoth on wheels and monster-truck shock absorbers. To save you some research, this beast is called a Gurkha LAPV. It's built on a Ford F550 chassis and was developed to withstand IED attacks with optional NATO level 3 armor. Though the top speed is about 90MPH, this beast is the perfect vehicle for the tight streets and uneven terrain encountered by Hobbs in his pursuit of Dom through Rio and surrounding areas in Brazil. And sorry, this vehicle is not available to civilians. Other than the cars there are a few more good reasons to head to the theater for this film. Adding Dwayne Johnson to the cast finally gives Vin Diesel someone imposing to match up with physically. Johnson's character Hobbs is a tough guy who lives like there is a strict line between black and white. While some of the characters in the film only have time to come off as two dimensional, Hobbs has three dimensions and is forced to make some choices that put his multiple motivations up against each other. Don't expect any Oscar worthy acting from Johnson or any of the other folks involved and don't expect some sort of gritty Eastwood realism and you should have a good time. As I mentioned, the plot of the film isn't real twisted, unique, or surprising, but it's fully realized and satisfying by the time we reach the conclusion.",Fast Five
271,CassandraSparkles,"Very cool cars, sexy people, lots of action, and gorgeous Rio de Janeiro",9,4 May 2011,"Fast Five is an ocean of motion and it never lets up. It was the first movie I saw in the IMAX format and it washed over me like a tsunami.From the beginning, Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel), his consigliere Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker), and others are stealing impounded lux cars from train packed with DEA agents while it's still operating. The cars are for Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida, always a gem), the crime boss of Rio de Janeiro. Great set piece: A big ole truck rides alongside to act as midwife to the cars as they roll from boxcar to the ground at high rates of speed. O'Conner's fighting with Reyes' henchman whose operating the industrial truck. He knocks him off and is hanging on for dear life as Toretto drives up trying to catch him before he smashes against a bridge pillar. Shot to shot to shot, he jumps, truck explodes in blaze of glory, and he and Diesel do a slo-mo dive into a raging river way down below, all three of them, Walker, Diesel and the car. The cars should have top billing. Especially the cars at the end when Roman (Tyrese Gibson) pulls up with hot babe in tow and his bud Tej (Chris 'Ludicrous' Bridges), a hard working day job man, slyly has his hot babe drive up in the same car.What's the movie about? Hot fast shiny cars, keep the motor running, sexy people (""We're a family!""), $100 million in untraceable bills and two identical bank vaults. Tyrese and Ludicrous bantering like old friends. But never forget the 3 monuments to Mother Nature, Dwayne Johnson, Vin Diesel and Rio de Janeiro. Rio should have gotten top billing as a person in its own right. The beach at Ipanema. The hills covered with colorful houses in stadium seating.Diesel's less combustible than he's been before. He's the natural leader but picks his words carefully and all his crew lean in for every word.If you like cars, sexy people, lots of action, gorgeous Rio de Janeiro, an implausibly irresistible heist and tawdry touches of Mission Impossible and Ocean's Eleven, you'll like Fast Five.",Fast Five

I've tried to write what exactly this film is here, and well, you can't summarize a kaleidoscope, now can you? So it can't be done here. Only in person, with a friend, or just watch this film, and look at everyone's expressions in this film, right down to the characters near the bottom of the cast list. Everybody is part of this film, and everybody looks like they are living it. And things left for the audience to figure out about the characters all add up to a great respect for the audience and for the idea of thoughtfulness itself.

274,Achylles,Not bad but could be much better - does not fit the Fast and the Furious franchise,7,22 August 2011,"Seriously? Better than the first one?? You must be crazy..... If I wanted to watch that much action in a movie I would watch Faster..... or Rambo... or Rocky. But this ain't Faster neither Rambo neither Rocky - it's Fast and Furious. I don't see nitrous oxide upgraded cars with any exotic paint or vinyl and neither installed neon lights on them nor hot chicks and high bets round and around them... The lack of races and the fantastically-action scenes made me give it a low 8. In this part of the series the staff overdid with the action and didn't put on the racing idea enough. It looks like Faster(where Dwayne Johnson stars too) with some fantasy. There are some unreal things in this movie like when Dom and Brian stole the safe and bound it to their cars through a rope. I don't know how but both the rope and the safe didn't break after crashing many police cars and even the moment when they totally destroyed the bank building. I do wonder how didn't the rope tear. The directors didn't miss the racing stuff also because they also put a race in this movie but they didn't put enough so they deviated of the title ""Fast and Furious"". And the end of the movie was so surprising..... Just like a magic but I can't explain it exactly. Overall the movie was good but I missed the adrenaline of the illegal races, the nice-made cars and the race tracks. I liked the first 2 movies in the series more than this one. I'm looking forward to seeing F&F 6 where Dwayne Johnson will participate again. I hope the directors bring back the old standard of the series and I'm also looking forward to seeing Toretto going in Tokyo along with Han and I wanna see Toretto racing again Shawn(Lucas Black). Professionally I find the movie amazingly created. The special effects, the acting and the performance are amazing. But as it is a part of my favourite franchise I give it eight because it does not contain enough of the racing stuff as it is supposed to be as being a Fast and Furious movie.Plot - mild, proper for an action, fairly not predictable; 8/10.Acting - the actors were just perfect as always; Also loved to see Han, Ludicrous, Roman and The Rock together as being an addition to the movie; 10/10.Writing - fairly good but could be better; 7/10.Performance - Very well done; Special effects were brilliant; Car chases were very straining; Action scenes were immaculate; The lack of racing and the excessiveness of unreal things are a not small weakness in the performance itself. 8/10",Fast Five
275,bellaperfection,So wrong!!!,1,13 September 2011,"My opinion.. This movie was so bad!! Not worth 1 star.. If it wasn't for all the sexualizing of women and all the girls in revealing clothes walking around zooming in on girls it may have been a half decent movie, anorexic looking girls in skimpy outfits half the movie is all about.. It just doesn't do it for me.. It's just wrong.. If you they need to use that much crap in it for it to get ratings well it mustn't be that good.. I thought it was awful!!!I can't wait to see a movie where they have guys walking around in G Strings the whole time.. Zooming up on their privates.. You almost never see that.. It's just getting tiring.. It definitely could have been better without the girls!!",Fast Five
276,emo_boi1012,5th times the charm! Best Fast and Furious film yet!,9,24 April 2011,"When I saw all of the Fast and Furious films, I thought ""that's it, there's no way this franchise can get any better!"" All of the films are so stale that it's not that enjoyable and it's not a ""full-adrenaline thrill ride"" anymore. But this film, they went over the top but it works...The first thing why this film is really good is the return of the characters from past films. A lot of familiar faces like Ludicrous, Tyrese Gibson and Matt Schulze. Gibson was funny as hell, his humour made everyone laugh and his hilarious quotes are just epic. I just loved the idea that they're all back together like a family.Second, the hatred relationship between Dom and Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson)was one of the things I like about the film. Once they both saw each other during the chase scene, everyone in the audience was like ""OHHHH!"" you can tell that the feud between them was gonna be amazing. Dwayne Johnson portrayed Hobbs very well. It's like he wasn't given any script and the director told him, ""JUST BE A BAD-ASS"" that's how good he was! I was disappointed that the fight scene was a bit short but it was very aggressive and destructive. I would like to see Hobbs again in the next sequel.Third, the elements of car chase scenes are changed in this film. There are some scenes that involves racing (like the police car race and the police vault scene) but they don't show most of the racing and mainly focused on the job which is to rob the richest man in Rio. I think it worked very well. The explosive and destructive scenes are just insane! The train scene was just crazy and the bridge scene with just total mayhem! I thought these scenes would never happen and looks too crazy but it was very entertaining, it just kept me on the edge of my seat.*MASSIVE SPOILER. DON'T READ THIS IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT* I was about to leave the cinema during the credits but when I saw this surprising post credit scene, I just thought I could give you an advice...ALWAYS STAY TILL THE END OF THE FILM BECAUSE YOU'LL NEVER KNOW WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN NEXT!Eva Mendes (as Monica Fuentes in 2 Fast 2 Furious) appears as a cameo and she reveals to Hobbs that Letty (Dom's girlfriend) is alive. I WAS LIKE HOLY S***! It definitely made me want to watch the next sequel. I'd like to see what Dom will do after he's with Elena and of course the ""feud"" between Dom and Hobbs.Overall, There are definitely lots of improvements from previous films and it was an ""entertaining, humorous action packed"" film and I recommend this film to anyone because this could be one of the biggest films of the year. MUST WATCH!BEST FILM OF THE FRANCHISE 9/10",Fast Five
277,farmersrachel,High Speed Thrills For The Entire Family,9,30 April 2011,"WOW!!!!This is my first review but I just couldn't resist throwing a big shout out to this movie. I am a 53 year old woman and I took my 30 and 14 year old daughters and we were all on the edge of our seats for 2:10. We had already fallen guiltily in love with parts 1 and 2 on instant watch Netflix, skipped 3, and have 4 on order. This sequel had just the right amount of action mixed with better plot and definitely more character development and emotional bonding than the other entries in the franchise. All characters are brought together and the addition of the Rock just amps up the sweat and muscles. The bookend action scenes are jaw dropping and though I started the series in love with Paul Walker, Vin Diesel is now my first love. The dialog is still cheesy and there is still plenty of macho posing and women in scanty garb but it's what we expect from this series. The best part is that this movie can be watched by the entire family and that is rare these days with all the profanity, blood, and sex. I only remember maybe 5 curse words in the entire movie, and although there was a lot of gunfire the blood was kept to a minimum. We went to a 5:30 pm showing in a large theatre and it was almost sold out with a long line waiting for the next showing when we left. I looked around and noted all age groups, including families with small children. Be sure to stay after the credits!!",Fast Five
278,metalhead-austin,Best one of them all,9,20 December 2018,"This film definitely takes the title for most realistic.
Love the directing in this film a lot! The only thing I wish was different was more racing. Not showing the race between the Charger and the Porsche was a little disappointing but the rest of this movies action makes up for it! Had it had more races this movie would be a solid 10",Fast Five
279,JoeStok13,Incredible!,8,29 March 2013,"Fast Five is, for me, the best movie of the series. The movie really matured. There were no more pimped-out cars with neon lights and NOS (Nitrous Oxide Systems), which at first was like trademark Fast & Furious. Now some people may see that as a con, but I would have to disagree. There are a wide variety of amazing cars on display in this film, including Dom's Dodge Challenger, a Toyota Supra, Nissan Skyline, Ford GT40, Koenigsegg CCX and Dodge Charger Police Interceptors. What I noticed was that the characters all suited their respective vehicles, like Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson), who is a complete beast, and the Gurkha LAPV, which is an armored military vehicle that annihilates everything in its path, much like Luke Hobbs. Dom mostly drives his Dodge Challenger, which is an American Muscle car and also suits him. So the car coordination is superb in this movie.The action sequences were also of some class. I was amazed by how realistic everything looked, even though it was completely impossible. The movie consists of some insane stunts, like destroying cars and buildings with a 1 ton safe latched onto a car, a huge fight, which sees 500 pounds of muscle clash, and an exciting plot that keeps you on the edge of your seat and will sometimes catch you by surprise.The movie also has a large cast, with characters from the previous movies coming together to form the group. Sung Kang, from Tokyo Drift, returns as Han. Although his character died in Tokyo Drift, it was later revealed that the events of Tokyo Drift occur after the events of Fast Five. Ludicrous and Tyrese Gibson return as Tej and Roman from 2 Fast 2 Furious. These familiar face were a nice touch and seeing them work together created a pleasant atmosphere. Some cheesy one liners, from Gibson and Diesel, were an amusing touch. The cast had great chemistry and the acting was solid.If you are the kind of person that likes to keep it realistic and will comment on everything that is of questionable realism, then you may have a hard time enjoying this movie. At times the movie can be outrageous and over the top, but it is definitely an incredible experience and a memorable movie.",Fast Five

281,Seattle_Slew,If you like ACTION Movies ...,6,21 May 2011,"this is for you! Great car scenes and fights! Okay story line and BEAUTIFUL shots of Rio de Janeiro throughout. See one of the world's most picturesque cities from a vantage point not often seen.The final ""chase scene"" is one to behold, as a large vault is dragged though the streets and the last twist makes it all memorable. If you tend to not like the nonsensical and unbelievable look for another movie, but as I said IF action is what you seek, go see Fast Five! It's also good if you're familiar with the storyline from it's previous releases and be prepared for Fast Six!",Fast Five
282,Cowzilla15,Not a hint of realism...,6,29 April 2011,"Now, this movie had its strengths... and its weaknesses... First off, great acting. All actors were superb. Good action scenes, nice action shots and cinematography. The script was a bit shabby.. But I need to vent about my main issue with this title... It doesn't have any realism in the movie at all. None.First example: A car drives in front of a bus, they were going fairly fast but it should not have had THIS outcome.. The bus hits the back of car. The bus is then propelled 20-30 feet into the air, lands, and is ripped to shreds. No fatalities either, and somehow they snuck an inmate out from the scene of the crime without a soul knowing about it. The bus flying through the air from a minor collision like that is what really angered me.Second example: An all-terrain vehicle speeds along next to a train. Not only does it stay with the train for a good 10 minutes in the exact same spot without any trouble adjusting to the trains speed, but it is clamped on with enough stability that a team of 2 can use plasma cutters to cut a wall large enough to smuggle a car out of. I liked the idea, but it wasn't put together properly. To make things worse, after a few cars are smuggled out, a final car, with about 2 feet of room to gain momentum with, had enough speed to make an enormous leap off of the train and land perfectly with smooth sailing the rest of the way. This is followed by two men in the car flying off of a cliff large enough to kill anybody landing in the water below. In the real world, limbs would have been lost. They land like it was nothing.Third example (this takes the cake): An armored vehicle plows through the walls of a police station.. I'm okay with this. Two Chargers pull up, chain themselves to this 10 ton vault, and have enough traction and friction to pull the entire vault off of the wall and out of the building. In a real world situation, the cars would make no progress and spin out, or the chains would break... and they take off! Speeding through Rio with a 10 ton vault, wrecking down buildings, smashing cars, dodging people, and smashing everything else in sight. This really irritated me. It even went through a large concrete building, the chain being strong enough to tear the building apart. I have no clue how this is even plausible. The vault then flies around smashing everything in its path again, still being pulled by these two wimpy cars. Eventually, the police catch up. The drivers suddenly have the dexterity to move the vault and fling it to their will. They smash some more cop cars, cause more collateral damage, and then decide they are going to split up. One Charger takes the vault on its own, and another takes off in the opposite direction. This solo driver suddenly has even more dexterity, and flings the vault around some more, taking out cop cars left and right, killing people exactly how he ""planned it"". Like I said earlier, if you are pulling a vault the size of a building around in a solitary car, the tires would not have enough traction to continue, and the car wouldn't have enough horsepower to drag that monstrosity around.It goes on and on, I wish I could actually watch this movie without those three examples. It would be great. I loved the rest of it. But, save all this junk for a sci-fi movie... I can stand small amounts of movies being non-realistic, there are exceptions.. But not taking realism into consideration at all is a bit of a downer. Apparently physics don't apply to anybody living in Rio De Janeiro.",Fast Five

This is the one sequel where they got the action right on all aspects. Not much CGI at all unless it was so good you couldn't tell. Crazy shootouts and an awesome fight scene. The story is probably the best out of all the sequels, while not quite that great. Its a rip off from The Italian Job, but i never liked that movie.The character development is there for our main cast from the first film. While a couple action parts are cheesy its hard not to like this movie. Much better then the last film and Dwayne Johnson made the movie better.

285,hersheedontplay,5th time's a charm,7,25 November 2016,I just finished watching Fast & Furious 4 and now I'm starting this installment Fast Five. I must say so far this has been the very best transition from one installment to the next so far. Much better than any of the previous installments. I loved the introduction of the Rock in this installment as well as the fact that all of the originals were back. Now the stunts in this installment was were the best up until this point in the franchise library. Vince ... It was nice to have Brian save Vince in the last one Vince was in( part 1) because after that here in Fast Five they got along pretty well. Let me buckle down and tune in to this one ... I think I can recall much of this one and I recall it being pretty entertaining. Time for me a beer and movie time.... I'll add more if need be. Yes bring in the team. Yes this is when it got back good. I'm loving it. The mix of all the best from each installment prior to this one and it's on. This was the best one after 1,Fast Five

The whole ""Safe"" pulling sequence was so horrible and stupid I couldn't believe my eyes. Also the movie is boring, the acting and the script are insulting.

Especially, loved it when the truck right in between the road to surprise its true reason for being on roads. Sure is worth a watch. Among all the previous F&F movies, i guess the ""Tokyo Drift"" is the best of movies I have ever watched. Find it really hard for any of the movies to come close to that. I guess the next part of the movie they should pick up some of the latest model and told something about the latest car. In fact, they should bring in those Aston Martins, Bugatis, Formula-1 cars, allthose re completely missing. If you watch Transporter-series, they focused so much on the car, even F&F needs something more & abit extra X-factore :)",Fast Five

Just different characters . thats it. otherwise the theme is always the same. The American military is again there ( any good movie for an American should involve the military.. pathetic mentality..)The only good thing about this movie is it was filmed in Rio De Janeiro. I think the whole movie was for a fight between Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson. I really don't know how this movie got 7.8 rating. Never trust a movie with the so called American heroes.,Fast Five

We see what kind of crap gets pushed out from other companies (200MPH for one, this is not an endorsement, do not see it trust me) and you realize how good the F&F movies are.

That's about all of the plot I'll give away but I will say there is an awesome seen in the movie where Vin Diesel's character (Dominick Toretto) has an epic fight scene with Dwayne Johnson's character (Detective Dobbs).I really recommend this movie to everyone.I would give this movie a 7-7.5/10. I liked the movie, it had action, it had some pretty girls, it had some mad actors, it had some car racing(only a scene or two) and it had a bank heist, what else would you want from a movie?

Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson both play amazing roles, and their actual personality shines through their characters, which truly makes a movie a good movie.

The Rock(Dwayne Johnson) was Excellent Luke Hobbs who was bad ass in his role and looked to be enjoying be apart of the cast..the pivotal scene where he is down and looks to be out help and unexpected is on the way in such a epic guns blazing scene that was so damn good!

The Film also contains a scene where Vin Diesel has an incredible fight with Dwayne Johnson,that alone is worth the price of admission. It also brings back some familiar faces from the previous films including, Han, Tej, Vince and Roman Pierce, played by Tyrese Gibson who has some of the best/worst dialogue in the film, but is just as funny as he was in ""2 fast 2 furious"".

There was a bit for everyone: good comedy, nice cars, very dynamic and full of action, thrill and last but not least very good acting from Vin, Dwayne and the others.All in all it was well worth the money, it was obviously the best from its franchise and I am really looking forward to the F&F 6.",Fast Five

In my opinion, this was NOT the BEST of fast and furious, the best is still Tokyo drift.Though most of the population just needs some violence and action to call it a good movie. Whether you want to admit or not, the fighting scenes were fake. Watching the movie, at the end, what lesson did you learn? Big guys with guns kick ass? Yay, when I grow up, I want to ride fast cars, steal money, and have a gang family and I'll still be the good guy.

The last FF movie that I liked was Tokyo drift. Rest of them (following it) are just boring and uncreative.The movie has a plot which is borrowed from Ocean's eleven without a clear role for each of the players. The car chase scenes are unbelievable and stupid. There were hardly any decent car chase scenes.

301,Zelnak,Great Action and Value for Money F&F Film,8,12 September 2011,"Any reviewer who rates this low (thereby bringing down the IMDb rating for this film) completely misses the point of the F&F franchise and the writers' intention to bring a fun, action-packed car chase film to it's fans - not, to challenge the minds of intellectuals or get all the physics right. Let's face it, what movie DOES? It's entertainment! You're paying to be wowed and impressed - not to learn how a car crumples on slamming into the ground awkwardly at high speeds. Criticise this film for its lack of realism and you'll join the pack of nay-sayers and party-poopers in the corner! Straight up, this film is one of the best - if not THE best - of the Fast and Furious series so far. It's loaded with crazy fast paced action, which it delivers right off the bat with an explosive rescue of Dom from his prison bus. Totally crazy, but totally amazing to watch - as are all of the action sequences including dragging an over-sized object behind the cars and having it slam into everything in sight. Hilarious, maddening and absolutely awesome to watch! Hey, it's entertainment.One thing that this movie does do for fans is get all the favourite cast members back together for a great heist film. The car racing is not as prominent in this movie, as in previous versions, but it still includes some exciting races with the lead characters. Stunt driving is there in droves, and the cars - whilst not a huge range - are impressive enough to wet one's appetite.The story is solid, and the characters are well defined and the introduction of The Rock into the mix, facing him against Vin Diesel, is a waving banner for ""great fight sequence""! It's intense and reminiscent of the crazy WWE action! There's a bit of romance, a sprinkling of a thriller and suspense, a sampling of horror (softened for a well rounded audience), plenty of over the top action and the standard comedy moments (keenly enjoyed in this series). If you want a new take on the Fast and Furious series, with plenty of good times and value for money - whether you see it in a cinema, or rent it on DVD/BD - then Fast Five is certainly worth every cent!",Fast Five

The moment they blow up the prison bus in the first scene, I knew this movie was gonna be fun.The following part after the bus trashing sequence is a little boring but the fun comes when they steal the muscle cars from the train. It was fun to watch this movie but I must say a little technical glitches and hard to believe concept in the later action sequences was kind of boring. Dwayne Johnson made the movie a great watch and the muscle cars were also pretty good. A had earned action fast paced movie but definitely one of the action movies of the year.

The sound of the cars and everything is really cool because it all combined together well. All the cars and racing was very intense and cool. The actors where the best for the movie because they are tough and suit the personalities of the movie characters. For example, Dom one of the main characters was big strong and scary so it showed that the people that are racing the cars have to be tough and scary looking. Then they have Paul walker and he doesn't look like a racer but is and is apart of the family. So overall, the movie Fast Five is a very good movie and deserves good ratings.",Fast Five

It was a treat to watch two raging bulls Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson in a single movie, can't say who looked dominating because both have such awesome physiques. Paul Walker in the role of Brian'O'Conner was as always up to the mark though his chemistry with Jordana Brewster was not so good this time. There was also no apparent reason to cast Tego Calderon and Don Omar as they did not make the movie better at all. Although I was glad to witness the return of Sung Kang and the stunningly gorgeous Gal Gadot both of whom did utmost justice with their roles. Tyrese Gibson and Ludicrous also did a good job and Rio, Brazil, the location in which the story is set gave tremendous opportunities for great action and car chase sequences with which the Director did a great job, the cinematography was too good and the background score was also nice. The two main advantages this movie had over its predecessors were:1) The presence of Vin Diesel with Dwayne Johnson and the impact it had on the audience.2) Totally awe-striking action sequences, they getting so much better with every sequel, both visually as well as conceptually.Overall, a great experience irrespective of whether you are a fan or not.Now waiting eagerly to hear news about the next part!!!",Fast Five
306,epoc3000,"Worst of the franchise (only one minor spoiler, but i had to be mentioned)",1,1 September 2011,"OMG... I cant believe the high rating of this movie. You gotta be kidding me. This is by far the worst of all Fast and Furious. The script was artificial. The acting was boring. The story is so fast paced in the beginning, it doesn't look natural at all. It's just one scene glued to the other.Also, I'm OK with some cinematic action scenes, but there are some over the top ridiculous scenes in this movie. Not to mention the clichés. I mean, we know it's hard to avoid clichés in movies like this, but some are so old people have to stop using them, like good guys being caught by bad guys. Then bad guys leave good guys tied up with only one guy to watch them. Good guys get free and subdue that one bad guy. I MEAN, REALLY? Whoever wrote that scene must be a genius! HOW DID HE COME UP WITH THAT SH*T?Horrible, dude. JUST HORRIBLE! It feels like they are just trying to see how far they can push the sequels. Write any crappy plot with an excuse for them to race and see if people buy it. They are buying it so far, so yeah, expect another sequel. Unfortunately...AND Don't GET ME STARTED ON ALL THE SCENES WHERE THEY MADE RIO LOOK LIKE A CITY IN US! Our Police don't have those fancy cars. That train they took does not exist. And the worst of them... The Rock coming into the favela with 5 dudes. He stares at the bad guys int he favelas and they chicken out. ROFL! Yeah, right. Our elite forces go to the favelas in armored cars, in huge numbers, and are received with bullets. But not THE ROCK! All he has to do is raise his eyebrow. LAME! PATHETIC!",Fast Five
307,iamthematrix-1,Fast Five is supercharged and running on NOS,9,30 April 2011,"After the horrendously disappointing sequel that was 2fast 2furious, my hopes of reliving the excitement and energy of the original were dashed, quicker than Dom could push the NOS button on his pimped out charger.Tokyo Drift was refreshing, and Fast and Furious was a step in the right direction. I'm so glad then, that Fast Five has resurrected my love for outrageously overpowered cars driven by super-models speeding to hyper techno low bass music. This movie rocks.Of all the movies in the series, it is by far the most action-packed. Explosions, car chases, free-running, you name it. It keeps you on the edge of your seat, and occasionally it will throw you off it.The acting has improved, which is to be expected, since most of the actors have gained experience since the first installment. Adding The Rock as an antagonist to Vin's character was a smart move. It kept the film fresh, and built up tension between the characters.The only problem I have with this film is it's lack of focus on the cars themselves. Don't get me wrong there are enough cars in the film to fill Jay Leno's garage, but I wish they would incorporate a deeper level of interest in the cars, and not just the characters. But besides that minor issue, you will love this film, it's full of new ideas, and it even has a twist to boot, something I was not expecting.Fast Five goes back to the original formula, tweaks it a bit, and blasts it back in your face.Highly recommended9/10.",Fast Five

HOWEVER you will be disappointed no longer as this film brings everything we have missed since the first. all the action and violence and comedy and general awesomeness. I managed to catch this film on a flight back from the states and it honestly made the flight go insanely fast. the film admittedly has some flaws and a OK story line but that is more than made up for with the rest of the film. and the final scene with the dodge chargers although a little unrealistic was no less one of the most awesome in history (no more on that or the film will be ruined). i can not say how impressed i was with this film after all the failures of its predecessorsROLL ON FAST 6!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1",Fast Five

The storyline, casting, directing and more specially the team of stars in the previous fasts. In fact, all stars in the previous parts play their role in this part (sometime very short) and gathering such a group of actors in a sequel is unique after ""Godfather 3"".The story is a little different with previous parts and this time, the movie is more similar to movies like ""Italian job"".

What bothers me the most about this movie is the extreme stupidity and lack of logic. For example, in the beginning of the movie the team is raiding a train to steal cars located in the last carriage. A few carriages a head there are some police officers. They don't hear when the team uses blow torches to open the wall of the train carriage containing the cars resulting in the whole carriage wall ripping of, but when 1 shot is fired inside the carriage containing the cars, they suddenly get aware of the raid. Another example is when some characters are chased by police officers on some rooftops and vigorously time after time survives 30 feet jumps from rooftops down to the concrete street without a scratch. However, the most unrealistic and stupid scene is a car chase in the end of the movie. I wont spoil it for you but trust me, you will laugh or cry as all the laws of physic and logic are boldly defied.",Fast Five

You would think that after all the other four films that five would be pushing the sequel's too far. now i can see that, However ""Fast Five"" is by far the best one out of all of them. i guess because they have put much more money into this film, the budget was an estimated $125,000,000, the film was well advertised and people were more aware of this film coming to the cinema and there was a big ""hype"" about it coming out. I think the hype towards this film was the audience responding to all the characters from the previous films are now featured together as one ""big family"" and working together as a team to do this last job. This films got it all, comedy action thrill suspense, muscle and guns and girls in next to nothing washing beautiful cars, i mean seriously can anything top that? watch and see, yet another must see film and will rock your night at the cinema.",Fast Five
312,jleonard31,The 'Citizen Kane' of Street Racing Heist Reunion Flicks,8,29 April 2011,"Fast FiveBefore I lose any of my movie critic street cred (assuming I even have any), I'd like to point out that I'm not actually placing the fifth Fast & Furious movie among the ranks of great cinema pieces of history. I'm not even suggesting that it will be the go to reference for pretentious people of the future to over hype when they want to sound like they know far more than they do about movies. I am simply stating that amongst its peers, it is a stand out piece of work. The fifth installment of the Fast & Furious series takes up right where the fourth left off, with the car savvy and fan favorite criminal mastermind Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) on a prison bus on his way to the big house, with his sister Mia (Jordana Brewster) and her beau, former F.B.I. agent Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) fast on their way to busting him out. This shouldn't be a spoiler for anyone who has seen the trailers and noticed how much Vin Diesel isn't in prison, but they succeed in freeing Dom. The trio soon find themselves in trouble with the wrong bad guys after a botched heist, which subsequently ends up getting them framed for criminal activities that put them in the sites of U.S. DSS Special Agent Luke Hobbs (Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson) and his team of basically government backed bounty hunters. Dom and Brian come up with a plan to get revenge on the bad guys, and make a little cash on the side, but in order for it to work they are gonna need a little help. From pretty much everyone they've ever met. This is where the reunion aspect of Fast Five emerges. The fourth film in the series (Fast & Furious) touched on a fun idea of reuniting the cast from the original film, which hadn't been together since then, and adding a few new faces along the way. This installment ups the ante (and the fun) by bringing back most of the important characters from all three of the original films, including Roman and Tej (Tyrese Gibson and Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges) from 2 Fast, 2 Furious, Han (Sung Kang) from Tokyo Drift, and several other familiar faces along the way. Getting the original band back together in four was fun. But getting the whole band back together in five really takes things up a notch. And therein lies the considerable fun and charm of Fast Five. This is not grand cinema, even as far as action movies go. No ground is broken, the plot is weak, the schemes are too elaborate, and the physics are mind boggling at best. But we are five movies deep in this franchise now. If you are looking for thought provoking action dramas or Bourne style visceral hand to hand choreography, you should already know you are in the wrong place. Fast Five promises little more than the fun of watching hot girls and muscle men driving fast and beating the tar out of one another. And it delivers that in spades. It even throws in some big guns and explosions for good measure. Movies should be judged primarily on how well they can hold up to the promise of what they try to be. Fast Five is supposed to be loud, fun, in your face escapism. Something with a lot of familiar faces, some good laughs, and a lot of pulse pounding action. It is all of that and probably a little more. If you do not like Fast & Furious movies anyway, then you probably take your movies too seriously, or at least don't know how to separate when you should take them seriously and when you shouldn't. Either way, you are definitely buying the wrong ticket. However, if you are a Fast & Furious franchise fan, or simply like a little mindless fun, you are in for a great ride. This one is the best of the bunch.",Fast Five

They are all ridiculous, over the top and unrealistic but who cares?!? It's so entertaining to watch and having all the cast back was awesome! Practically every hot car makes and appearance and then of course you have the hot men :) Vin Diesel and Paul Walker had great on screen chemistry that made me love them even more.

It wasn't just a whole bunch of cars everywhere it actually had a good plot and a really good twist. The Rock was hot as always and he did a really good job in the film as well.

You won't be disappointed and neither will your local venue as you guzzle through 3 boxes of popcorn. Otherwise, if you enjoy: a) Plots that don't make you face palm yourself. b) Actors that can actually act. c) Movies that adhere to the physical laws of this universe. d) Dialogue which doesn't make you roll your eyes every 15 minutes.STAY AWAY!

Even the cheesy lines and plot twists become enjoyable.Not sure I'd pay a full adult weekend cinema price to see it, but if you can get 241 or a student discount, definitely see it on the big screen!

The fight scene between the Rock & Toretto, GIMME A BREAK! One punch in the face from either of those guys would just about kill the other one. I guess nobody watches real fighting.2. The fall from the bridge! COME ON, again! 50-70mph off a car over a cliff that was easily over 60 feet, probably more like 100 feet = 99% certain death. The other 1% you would have a broken body.3. The BEST one of all...the final safe scene! I won't even try, you'll see....or maybe not.This isn't a horrible movie, just not a great one. Could have been a lot better.

321,FuryoftheFilmFan,Adrenaline pumping hardcore popcorn action done right,8,30 April 2011,"The weather is finally better, people are taking their clothes off all over the place and even though it is still spring time, summer movies are now officially kicking off and ladies and gentleman, we start this summer right with Fast Five. The Fast and Furious franchise is something of an acquired taste, a sort of guilty pleasure that hasn't really been shown the respect it has earned. It isn't known for any of the terms critics love to use when they complain about a movie, like intellectual dialogue, solid characterization or even anything remotely close to a thought provoking plot. No, what it excels in is another term that critics seem to have forgotten about. Popcorn, no that overpriced buttery stuff you get from a concession stand, I'm talking popcorn films! Energetic movies meant to entertain, a good solid waste of time! So what makes a good popcorn film? Well if this question is asked to the future filmmakers of tomorrow one need only to watch Fast Five to see a fine example of how to get it right. Director Justin Lin (who also directed the fast and the furious) makes a huge leap in directorial prowess by showing an incredible eye for action that every other director today should take note at. The man can film ACTION, and you know..In an action moviethat's kind of what you want and with that eye brings together an expendables version of the fast and furious franchise starring everyone's favorite fast and furious stars. Dominic Toretto (played by Vin Diesel) and his crew find themselves on the wrong side of the law once again as they try to deal with a drug lord and a federal agent that's hot on their trail. So , umback to talking about the action. It is INNNNcredible. Oh man this is my kind of action, I seriously have not seen this kind of solid , non computer generated action in a very very long time and Justin Lins camera work is top notch. Every shot is deliberate and clean. Ohso good. Aside from the action the other thing that makes this film work is the stars. Everyone from The Rock to Ludicrous play their characters great and have their own moments to shine. While the movie does slow down in the middle to what looks like Ocean's Eleven meets Fast and Furious, the stars are what keep this movie was falling apart. The movie at times felt like a parody of action films, filled with cheesy cliché's that are sometimes so subtle you'll miss it but Linn will toss another scene in there in case you did and often in hilarious ways . The rock is just so great, it's these roles he should be taking, not the flying fairy kind, he's so great in this film I would love to see a spin off with this very character of his, this cocky nonsense guy who just knows everything, and he really does know everything. Frankly, that's the only two things that this movie has going for it. Action and pretty people and in a popcorn film, that's all you need. So this one is easy folks, for those with their noses in the air looking for only citizen Kane caliber films to entertain them, you should know better, you know a fast and furious movie isn't for you. It's a vapid film that would have been unwatchable had it not been for its action and star power. But it pulls off being entertaining. So if you're looking for adrenaline pumping action , seat rumbling roars of the hottest cars , beautiful people looking beautiful even when being shot at then you got yourself the definition of a popcorn film, meant to entertain you in every single way and this is popcorn done right.",Fast Five
322,mauro-batte,Too many characters and too little action?,7,14 May 2011,"For those of us who watched all of the Fast and the Furious series, simply the thought of having most of the main characters from the past editions in one movie is a valid reason to pay. The result is just what we expect of a Fast and Furious: stunts, rides and babes. The atmosphere of Rio is a refreshing alternative to American centered filming. However, ultimately, the film goes over the top. By telling the story through the view of the (not that) good guys, the bad guys, and, also, a third perspective, that of a team of elite FBI agents led by ""The Rock"", time worthy of boiling oil and pumping adrenaline is lost. Instead, we get more of the sit-at-home work-out-plan kind of scenes that are often unnecessary. Nevertheless, a true fan of cars and action will find Fast Five very enjoyable.",Fast Five

I was overjoyed after watching this start-to-finish thrill-ride and adrenaline rush offering!! It was not the kind of action-packed race flick where several pieces of disjoint stories are juxtaposed together to basically justify and depict the action and thrill itself, or in other words a messy story, but I had the genuine feeling that the story was well-knit and well-aligned with the amazing action and it had some substance which probably was lacking in previous movies. Especially now as we basically see law-breakers Vs law-enforcers and the boundaries are distinct and somewhat clearly defined, so almost the whole movie gave a feeling of Jason Bourne thrill, so one can imagine that here the story isn't compromised as one would expect before watching the movie----In the end, basically a very very good and thrilling cinematic experience and a valuable addition to the franchise itself. Even if you are like me, I mean, not a fan of racing flicks, this one would certainly force you to change your perspective quite a bit I can guarantee. Thanks!",Fast Five

Although I felt ""Suki"" was missing, they have picked the best of the whole list of characters and bought them all together in one film with a surprising good addition from ""The Rock"".At 1st I thought he might alter my perspective with his acting abilities but hats off to the man, he played his part well and added a crucially good character to the film, one to push Toretto to the limits.The whole production shouted ""here we are, this is the story as it was meant to be"" and not detracted as in the Tokyo Drift version, even though I actually enjoyed it for a film in it's own rights.there are, as always, parts of the film that have the imagination pushing believable limits but fuelled with the youth rush of excitement, you take it for what it is, enjoyable scenes with stretched reality that in all honesty, fits perfectly well within the story.The only criticism I would offer is one that leaves the average fan missing the end.

It's a great movie and I love all the characters (each one has a great story and depth behind them) but the fact that in the fourth one Letty is meant to have died whilst trying to get the man she loves - Dom - back into the US and is shown in a photo and believed to be alive in Berlin without telling her beloved where she is, is slightly confusing. Also at the start of the fourth it is meant to show what happened to Han before he wound up in Tokyo Drift (where he met his doom (weep)) and he as well as the audience seemed pretty convinced that he was heading straight there, but he somehow finds his way into Fast and Furious 5 because he hasn't quite made it to Tokyo yet - to confusing for my liking although I couldn't stop smiling when the whole gang is brought together - great idea and fabulous surprises - I can't wait the sixth one (confused that there is a sixth one though)!!!",Fast Five

But if you think this is a movie with races, you're wrong.This is a heist movie. But that isn't a bad thing, on the contrary! This franchise could use a fresh start and the big difference was that they toned down showing off fast cars and beautiful women, Fast Five is more character driven and brings back a lot of characters from previous movies, included a nice surprise at the end.My guess is we're probably gonna see more familiar faces in part 6, but we will have to wait for that. We also got new faces, in the form of Dwayne Johnson. It's a nice addition to see how he's determined to arrest the main characters and that the main characters are deep in trouble with several parties hunting them.Also different is that there isn't a single race in this one, but it has a lot of action and even subtle humor we haven't seen in the previous installments.Action fans, just go see it when you can!",Fast Five

There is a reason why this movie broke the record for movies opening in the month of April. Because it's THAT good! BOOM! Everything about this movie is better than the previous installments.1. Storyline 2. Action 3. Tension 4. Acting 5. HumorMy Fast Five for list of improvements. Fast Five was easily the best installment thus far in the series.

Because of this, I opted not to see Tokyo Drift or 2009's Fast and Furious. But after hearing rave reviews about Fast Five, I decided to give it a shot, and I'm very glad I did.Dominic Toretto, his sister Mia, and Brian O'Conner are in Rio de Janiero trying to start a new life and gain their freedom. But the gang soon finds themselves between a rock and a hard place, as a powerful businessman/drug lord wants them dead and a relentless Fed by the name of Luke Hobbs (played by Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson) wants them in prison. Needless to say, the story is action-packed, which brings me to the action sequences: they are plentiful and they are intense! A kick-ass fight scene between Toretto and Hobbs was especially memorable for me. Granted, a lot of the stunts are very far-fetched, but what would you expect, this is a Fast and Furious movie, and the seemingly non-stop action makes the 2 hours and 10 minutes a very fun ride. Jaw-dropping action, a fast-paced story, a bold performance by Johnson, and lots of beautiful women; add it all together and you've got a very worthy addition to the Fast and Furious series.",Fast Five

As cool and as much action as there was, there was also some sentimental feelings briefly though out watching. I would 100% go see this movie again.",Fast Five
334,mike198326,An AWESOME movie!!,10,2 May 2011,"I am a Fast and Furious fan, and of the essence that made the first film in which there's more than just mindless and spectacular car racing and tuning but there was a sense of family and belonging, then choosing to be faithful to ones new friends even if that means becoming hunted like them. The second and third film were as awesome but they lost that feeling, but in Fast and Furious 4 it went back to the roots that made this franchise so enjoyable and back to its original characters. But coming back to Fast Five, it is just as wonderful and breathtaking. I loved every single second of it! The fight between Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson was EPIC as was the car and safe chase! If it was 3-D I bet the safe would have been coming out at us! Justin Lin understands the franchise and is more than worthy to carry it on. There was of course an echo of the first film with Dwayne Johnson's character letting Toretto and O'Connor go, still saying he'll see them again. That friendship was unexpected but awesome!In short, A MUST SEE MOVIE FOR ANY FAST AND FURIOUS FAN OR NON FAN EVEN. I hope they will make F&F 6 as planned!",Fast Five
335,srknthk,Kick ass,9,11 May 2011,"This is one franchise that I wait every time to give some thing really special. And no doubt they have given some thing special. As always there is no dearth for the action sequences but I should say there are much less action sequences when compared to the previous ones. For sure those that are there are just awesome. Through out its fully energy packed and I don't have to mention about the adrenaline rush that the franchise gives. Personally I was sad that they cut a scene on street racing. A car for a car thing. How I wish they made an action packed adrenaline pumping stuff out of that. But as such as I said there is absolutely no dearth for action and adrenaline rush. Elsa Pataky(Elena Neves), Sung Kang(Han Lue) and Gal Gadot(Gisele Harabo) have done a good job out of their roles. Gal Gadot's scene on getting a finger print from the ruthless drug lord was really funny. It would be incomplete if I don't mention about Dwayne Johnson(Luke Hobbs). Amazing stuff from him as usual. Really enjoyed the fight between Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson. Must watch stuff. Although I found the vault dragging sequence to be not too logical I would say all in all its a must watch movie. I know I am a huge fan of this franchise but I tell you, you would enjoy seeing the movie even if you are not a die hard fan of it.Thumbs up!",Fast Five
336,AverageJoesReview,The BEST of the franchise!,10,8 April 2011,"I've been a personal fan of the F&F series ever since the very first title was released. Once I saw that Fast Five was in production I immediately began hunting down a pass for its first showing, I was successful. Fast Five is everything we all love about the franchise, fast cars, beautiful women, and of course some nail biting action scenes.Whether you're a long time fan of the movies, or a brand new viewer, this movie is a must see, you're guaranteed to get your moneys worth on this title.Best movie I have seen in a long time, it even managed to remove the bad taste that was left in my mouth by Tokyo Drift. This is going to be one of the biggest movies of the year, see it, or be left behind.Rating- 10/10 -Average Joe",Fast Five
337,nawabnikunj,Not the best but it wasn't the worst,8,12 May 2011,"Great movie but didn't close up to the expectations. As usual the base cast was great. Vin Diesel was awesome as expected. The rock was rocking in the movie, his character matched his true personality. As in the previous movies stunts performed were mind boggling and full of thrill, can't wait do do them myself. Cool and solid cars as in previous movies. Chicks wearing bikinis and riding hot bikes. Has some irrelevant superman fighting sequences but what about it every movie needs it. Good casting everyone fits well in their characters. Full of awesome stunts from the start to the end. One can never fall asleep while watching such a movie. The heist plot is very difficult to predict till the end which keeps your mind on the movie and not on the chick on the next seat. Full of thrills and twists. Not the best of Fast And Furious, seen better but still a must watch as the previous flicks...",Fast Five

339,EmmaGoose,Probably my favourite in the franchise!,8,1 May 2011,"Fast & Furious 5 is probably the best one in the franchise so far. It has great action sequences that follow the plot and do not drag on for too long without having any significance to the story. There was a great plot, this time Brain O'Connor finally being on the bad side (something I had been waiting for!). The start led immediately off the last movie, where Dom is broken out of prison. Then Brain, Mia and Dom flee to Rio to hide. There they manage to get the cops attention again by helping Vince pull a job. This time they aren't let off lightly- agent Hobbs is on their tail and he won't rest until they're behind bars. (I won't say much more because I don't want to give anything away!)I was thrilled to see all the old characters from all the movies back together again hatching brilliant mastermind plots and carrying them out so slick and smooth. I found that the first and fourth movie were a bit boring and lacked the amount of action and plot to keep me interested- My favourites were the second and third, though it was a disappointment not to have Vin Diesel in them. The only bring down in Fast Five was the lack of awesome cars like the ones in Tokyo drift. I was kind of looking forward to amazing paint jobs, races and girls like the first few but there were less of them in this one. That was the only disappointment. Came out of the cinema buzzing, more than pleased and excited for the next one! Yes! Live on Fast & Furious franchise!",Fast Five
340,benjaminapp,"Not bad, not bad at all.",7,26 April 2011,"To be honest I wasn't going into the theatre with high hopes for Fast Five, another testosterone fest. I was pleasantly surprised, despite the corny one liners ""this mission just went from mission impossible to mission in-freaking-sanity"" and over the top action scenes Fast Five is a delight. Firstly there is the cast, the acting is not all that bad, The Rock hits the spot as a tough cop and Vin Diesel is also good as the main protagonist. The action sequences are also great, I loved the first action sequence which drew comparisons with Bond films. The very last action scene where Vin Diesel and Paul Walker tow a safe through Rio is nicely choreographed and an incredible joy to watch. The fight scenes while there are not many are also intense and exciting especially the fight between the Rock and Vin Diesel. Fast Five being a typical action movie manages to deliver something to the viewer that excites them and gives them that sense of relief, it's not a must watch but is worth the money.",Fast Five
341,brandon-37-250290,Fast Five review by Featured Flicks,8,29 April 2011,"***Don't miss the bonus scene after the credits***Fast Five is a heart pounding thrill ride that easily beats the previous four movies in the quarter mile! I really enjoyed this movie and was surprised to find that many critics agree. After seeing the movie I was really happy with the storyline, as it was more complex and thought out then the previous movies.There were many other things to love about this movie besides the story. The scenery in Brazil was magnificent. Aerial shots of Rio are always beautiful, what an awesome city!There were many stars from previous films, which made the on screen reunion more dynamic and enjoyable if you've seen the other films. Roman (Tyrese Gibson), Tej (Ludacris), and Han (Sung Kang) all make a reappearance and lend their expertise to grab a share of a cool $100 million.To top it off Fast Five has more action, explosions, gunfire, fist fights and car wrecks than you can imagine. This is a two-hour adrenaline ride that will exceed all of your expectations of what and action movie can be. I enjoyed Fast Five's action originality, geographic selection of Rio, and complete story. You will love this movie more than the others and will want to see it twice on the big screen!",Fast Five
342,candidateshan,"""And why can't we drag a safe through downtown Rio behind our cars?""",6,21 May 2011,"Despite looking and sounding like a hung-over gorilla, Vin Diesel is actually among the smarter action stars around. He launched his own career, writing, directing and producing ""Multi-Facial"" (the movie that impressed Spielberg enough to write a role for Diesel in Saving Pvt. Ryan). He's produced 3 of his biggest hits and cannily passed on appearing in shitty sequels to the XXX and Fast and Furious franchises. He even passed on Hit-man! Yes, look let's just forget about Babylon AD for a minute, I'm trying to make a case for the guy here.When Diesel returned to F&F in the 4th movie, he did so as producer, and brought back the mojo the franchise had lost. Fast Five builds on that mojo, and is much better than its predecessor, largely because of the clever casting decision to bring back charismatic actors from previous installments and Ocean's Eleven-ify the movie. The ensemble cast takes some of the pressure off Diesel and helps us ignore Paul Walker. If you've seen 2Fast 2Furious, you'll agree that Walker isn't exactly the beating heart of the franchise. And despite Diesel's star status, his Dom Toretto (little more than a crook-with-a-heart-of-gold stereotype) cannot shoulder the weight of the entire series alone.So we see Tyrese Gibson, Ludicrous, Gal Gadot and Sung Kang reprising their roles from the various sequels (if you haven't seen them, you're not missing much character background - what you see here is pretty much all you get, with these guys), with Elsa Pataky and the Rock thrown in for added sex appeal.I could tell you about the plot, but really, do you care? Let's get to the important stuff. The Dodge Charger returns. Dom and O'Connor boost a bunch of cars off a moving train, blow it up, then drive one of them off a cliff in a spectacular set piece. There is the obligatory nighttime car race through city streets between the four male leads (Walker still nursing his bruised ego from an earlier loss in the 4th movie). And there's a ridiculous but somehow thrilling car chase finale, where the team pulls off a daring heist against every law of physics and logic (giving new meaning to the term ""drag racing"").Continuing its self-improvement efforts, the movie diversifies the action offerings of the franchise with a car ambush (reminiscent of Clear and Present Danger), a pulse-pounding gun fight and rooftop chase through Rio's favelas (a new favourite setting for Hollywood action vehicles) and some mano-a-mano wrestling between the two bald repositories of testosterone that headline the cast.I should warn you, the Rock is almost laughably bad in this movie. He lumbers around in a T shirt he appears to have borrowed from his infant son, barks orders at his long suffering team, shoots strangers indiscriminately and generally appears miserable. You would too, if your last movie had been 'Faster'. We know that he's a Federal Agent (because uh, he said so) and has sworn to take Diesel down, presumably because he resents that 'The Pacifier' trumped 'The Tooth Fairy' at the box office. The much touted shiny headed face-off between these two, when it comes, is actually a bit of a let down - the Rock seems worn out by the sheer amount of time he's spent chasing Diesel around Rio .It's all good fun, and there's never a dull moment, not even when Walker is blathering about the responsibilities of fatherhood. Diesel steps in and adds a strangely credible presence to this, and the other slower, talky scenes, sensing this is where the movie really needs the clout (such as it is) of his masculine persona. He then steps back to let the good lookin', fast talking' cast do its work elsewhere.And the girls? Israeli actress Gal Gadot is done with her national service and looks even hotter than she did in the last F&F movie (or in Date Night). She flaunts her languid curves in a negligible bikini, making a strong case for peace in the Middle East. Elsa Pataky pouts and does the best she can in her sexy cop outfit, which is less suited for law enforcement than for a Halloween sorority party. Her attempt to one-up Gadot in the curve flaunting department is foiled when Diesel rudely interrupts her just as she's taking off her tank top. Diesel reminds her (as he did Gadot in the last movie) that he's still pining for Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), then leaves. But Letty is dead! Isn't she? All I'll say is, stay until after the credits. It features a cameo by another curvy character from a previous installment. And introduces a cliffhanger that suggests exciting revelations in a future installment.If you're not well past being curious after 5 movies, that is.",Fast Five
343,EmBlack23,Excellent!,10,1 May 2011,"I have loved the whole Fast & Furiousseries ever since they were made,followingtheir stories as the movie series progressed.In The Fast & The Furious: Fast Five I lovedhow they showed all these cool and fast cars in a sequence when they were testing them for the cameras. I thought it was really great how they made Mia pregnant and throughout the movieit showed Dom and Brian's relationship change a bit towards each other (in a good way) and Dom threw the race for Brian and his sister (Mia).The graphics and visual effects were at a very high quality.

The Promotional work for the movie has been strong and with me personally being a big fan of the Fast & Furious Movies ( owning all dvds ) I Couldn't wait to see it! The cast are back... some old faces from the previous films return ( with some surprises in store too :) ) The Script is spot on and the banter with the characters keeps everyone laughing! The action is fast paced & I felt had a Jason Bourne Theme to it ( Opinions!? ) The amount of Cars in the movie was pretty high but it did stray from the Car Racing Scene but in my opinion it didn't let the film down... The Plot of the Movie was just-worthy & the characters had more depth to them, which was definitely lacking in the previous films!!AT over two hours long... this movie is definitely the best of the Franchise & is a must see for all fans but also for people who aren't so keen on the other movies because this one is a winner all round & with a planned sequel in the mix... One of the best movies this Year!!",Fast Five
346,tridjet,7.9? Seriously?,5,8 May 2011,"It is difficult for me to get to the theater so when I go I really want it to count, $20 is a lot to spend to waste 2 hours of my life. To this end I review IMDb and RT for guidance. So far, my experience doing this has substantiated the notion that movies with the best ratings are indeed good movies. An averaging of so many movie enthusiast's opinions should be a pretty solid indicator of the overall strength of a film, right? With Fast Five I knew I was taking a chance, the first of the F & F movies being primarily puerile nonsense, the sequels being merely more of the same. But with a rating of 7.9 I figured it was worth a shot. I enjoy a good action movie as much as the next guy. So I shelled out $25 to see the IMAX version and what did I discover? More puerile nonsense. Ridiculous plot line, action sequences that were just plain stupid or made no sense whatsoever. A juvenile exercise in car crashes, over testosteroned overmuscled tough guys grunting at each other amidst a world of scantily clad females, car crashes and shoot outs. A 7.9? Seriously? Is there a way to see how the ratings may be skewed by masses of teenagers who loved this movie? But more importantly: Can I have my $25 back now?",Fast Five
347,outlaw1990,Could have been so much better,4,13 May 2011,"I am a big fan of action movies, and I know that when it comes to this genre, the viewer has to go in knowing that the script will be corny, the actors will most likely be sub-par, and the stunts will be partially unrealistic. I also know what's great about action movies; the camera work, the explosions, the gun fights, and the adrenaline. Unfortunately,I feel that Fast Five gives the action genre a bad name. Let me start with the script. I rolled my eyes so many times that they started to feel sore. The worst line was probably, ""This ain't mission impossible! It's mission in-freaking-sane!"" Oh dear God, that one hurt. Secondly, the acting talents of the lead characters were significantly overshadowed by one terrible actor. That's right, you guessed it- Dwayne Johnson. He should have stuck to wrestling. He was a stiff, robotic, constantly grimacing steroid with legs. His fight scene with Dom consisted of nothing but Vin being thrown through fake walls and glass (over and over again), followed by some oddly homo erotic flexing of both actors pectoral muscles while looking into each others eyes. The story is just as flawed as the acting. While I enjoyed the little family reunion of characters from the previous films, the plot they are involved in is filled with so many holes. I will only mention the two big ones. First of all, Dom and Brian manage to pull an industrial sized bank vault out of a building using only souped up cars. This is not only completely ridiculous, but totally impossible without more powerful engines and traction on their side. It doesn't stop there though...next they drag the vault at top speed through Rio, using it as a weapon against the cops. Later on the vault is pulled at the same velocity by only one car. Come on. They couldn't have insulted our intelligence as an audience more. The biggest plot hole is the point where the two federal agents (Johnson and the token female agent) join up with Dom and Brian. I was so lost at this point...why would they suddenly decide that they should trust their criminal prey and work with them especially after: -The group is suspected of murdering the officers on the train. -Their racing buddies pull guns on said agents. -They drive through Rio with a vault killing not just corrupt cops, but innocent bystanders and cause a great deal of property damage. Just saying.The worst part of the ending was seeing Dom walk across the beach with the female agent. Really? They just had to give him a love interest, didn't they? He should have ended up with The Rock. They would've been a cuter couple.",Fast Five
348,migperez,If Only they Shutup and Blow Something Up,5,15 May 2011,Fast Five has been getting great reviews and is the first positive received film in the series. It's still another mediocre entry.I must admit that I have not seen all the The Fast and Furious films and I don't really care if I ever do. I decided to see this one and there be it. The movie begins show us Dom (Vin Diesel) is being sentenced to a long time in jail. We later see Paul Walker and Jordana Brewster helping him get free. Then they are on the run and they decide to get a job that the pay is real good. After doing the dangerous job they found out a very important dangerous man is behind the scenes. Then they call the whole crew back to do a big final score. Numerous actors from the series comes in and they show the process of them preparing for the score. At the same time a task force is sent to get Dom and his crew. Which is The Rock's character plays we get to see scenes of that.Let me get it out of the way the film's action sequences are made very well and they do provide the thrills for a movie like this. You can also see the movie drops the glorification of street racing even if it is dangerous. The problem with the film is it's pace and it's heavy nonsense dialogue. It was nothing interesting to say and I didn't really care much about it either. There was comic relief and trust me hot girls and sick ass cars. What bogs the film down is the pace and the dialogue. I do admit the last 30 mins of the film was truly exciting and fun if only the movie was like that the entire time.Sorry wasn't very convincing.MP **/* 2.5/5,Fast Five

But in Fast Five I felt that after first destroyed vehicle the cops needed to spend another 5 seconds to even hit the runners. After that police car gets destroyed, another 10 seconds till they are near: Not constant danger of doing a wrong turn and being busted.In contrast to what they give us in trailers: Few seconds for police to arrive and then constant mayhem. Tho a lot of car crashes is quite expensive only for one minute, you need to put some effort to make it a five minutes worth car chase.",Fast Five

They were supposed to be after FBI's most wanted nuts and should'v been able to close the chase soon instead the fast five guys managed to get a whole aircraft hanger for their plan simulation, they had whole lot of exotic cars for their dress rehearsal, they even managed to drag race stolen police cars across the street (I guess Brazil does not goes this numb even during world cup soccer), looks like lying low should read upside down from now. The whole climax scene is so damn ill conceived that it totally knocks the brain out , I can't even put in words how stupid the whole climax was, just watch it to believe.

With intense action sequences and the revival of Toretto and Mia supporting O'Connor in the last film, there could be no let-up of delivering an exciting yet somehow different Fast and Furious film this time around.They tried, and succeeded.They've tied in little bits of what made the other films good, all into one epic 2 hour long movie. While the plot itself is nothing original, we all know to expect this from this from a car film. But it has to be said the film is full of action, from drifting to gun fights, car, train and foot chases, confrontations, and of course, racing.The film starts right off from where we left from the last film, so we get to see how Dom is freed. Furthermore, many characters from all previous 4 movies return for the big heist, but they are given a good amount of time on screen each, which is important.And finally, we have The Rock himself making his debut into the franchise.We also learn a bit more about Dom, and the relationship Brian has with Mia and Vince (yes, Vince!). This is wrapped up with simple, witty dialogue between the gang and a few surprises in the story (not to mention a huge twist at the end mid-way through the credits. It has to be said, some stunts are pushed a little too far, but it does makes for some genuine terrific action.The only gripe I have is that it would have been nice to see more tuners but muscle car lovers won't be disappointed.A very well done to the makers of the film for bringing this one back to the roots of The Fast and The Furious while keeping the action tense and the storyline fresh.",Fast Five

All of the cars in the movie were really nice and very modern which is what got a lot of people to watch the movie. The engines of the cars gave the movie a good effect and it was almost like you were in the movie driving it. All the cars and racing was very intense. The actors were the best for the movie because they are tough and suit the personalities of the movie characters. For example, Dom one of the main characters was big strong and scary so it showed that the people that are racing the cars have to be tough and scary looking. Then they have Paul walker and he doesn't look like a racer but is and he worked his way into the family. Another thing I really liked about the Fast in the Furious movies in general are that a lot of the scenes are fast short scenes when the action is going on, but when there are slower scenes when everyone is calm and hanging out, the scenes get a little longer.So overall, I thought the movie Fast Five was a good movie and would watch it again.",Fast Five
359,rSkan,Turn your brain off...way off.,3,15 November 2012,"We watched this movie the other night knowing full well that this was going to be a ""turn your brain off"" type of movie but I didn't think it would be so incredibly stupid that it distracted the viewer from any sort of enjoyment. First off, let me preface the rest of this review on the basis that I've only seen one other of the Fast and Furious movies and that was the very first one. While that one was pretty dumb, most of the action was enjoyable and exciting to me because I could say that most of the plot and the stunts were based in reality. Or if it went outside of it, it was only for a short while. Fast Five is not anything like that and often has a disregard for any sort of sense plot-wise or even the very slightest acknowledgment of the existence of basic physics. Honestly, the simple plot would be acceptable for this type of movie but it's laid out and progressed through in such a poor manner that you don't even want to waste time even comprehending it or caring about it. That's one of the core issues - I don't care what happens. Brian and Dom get captured? They break out of their locks instantly and run away. How did they break out so easily? Who cares. Dom and the rest of his crew steal a bunch of cop cars and they race back through the streets with their lights and sirens on. Aren't they worried about getting caught by being the most wanted people ever? Who cares. Dom's crew needs to find out how to break into a several ton heavy safe but can't get access to it. They decide to practice by ordering their very own several ton heavy safe that is instantly delivered to their top secret warehouse. How did they get this so fast? Who paid for it? Who delivered it? Again, who cares. Since the director and writers apparently didn't care as well, why should I pay any attention to it either? With the plot being useless, that leaves one other main area in this type of movie in which I should be able to get some enjoyment out of: the action sequences. Unfortunately, I spent most of my time yawning through them because they're just boring since their ridiculousness never convey a sense of danger or excitement. For example, near the beginning of movie, Dom and his crew jack some cars out of a moving train but end up getting in trouble. That trouble eventually leads Don and Brian to drive their car off an enormous cliff, to which they jump out of their car, and fall several thousand feet into the water without a scratch (add in the instant teleportation of the bad guys to the bottom of this cliff in case your eyes didn't roll enough). I know this doesn't so too bad if you haven't seen the movie but this cliff is seriously absolutely gigantic. They might as well as jumped into the Grand Canyon and just got up and dusted themselves off after they landed at the bottom. Another outstanding action sequence occurs at the end of the movie. Don and the rest of his crew end up hooking up a few Dodge Chargers to a several ton heavy safe, pull it out of a wall, and then drive it through the streets of Rio causing destruction at every turn. I'm sorry, but a safe like that in this movie would weigh so much that it would be absolutely impossible to do this. Again, being this type of movie, I should just turn my brain off and accept it but you just can't. I could accept them pulling it out the wall and then opening it up there a second later but not pulling it several miles through the city like it's made out of paper mache. By the end of this movie, I honestly thought they would just start flying and shooting laser beams out of their eyes. If the sequel will be anything like this movie, the director and the writers might as well just put something like this in that one. At least it would add comedy to the mix instead of pretending like this movie has anything to offer the viewer.",Fast Five
360,raijian,"Unexpected, and enjoyable.",10,8 May 2011,"I have seen all of the Fast and Furious movies, and I personally felt that after the first movie, the film series degraded.In 2009, we saw Fast and Furious, which sparked a new direction in the series. Where the first three movies (The Fast and The Furious, 2 Fast 2 Furious, Tokyo Drift) focused heavily on scenes centered around the main characters engaging in some sort of street race or pursuit, Fast and Furious, delivered what seemed to be a 'plot maker' in the sense that it tied a couple of the films together. It focused more on characters, origins,with a well balanced medium of action, racing, as well as character relations and development. I feel that this was a good initiative in freshening up the film series that (again, personally) I felt to be dangling above the sharks.***Spoilers Ahead*** Fast Five, a sequel to Fast and Furious, proved again that this decision was positively for the better. Even with the current IMDb rating, I wasn't expecting much out of this film, I'll be honest. However, to my surprise this was a very good installment in the series. The action scenes were great, and the casting made them even better. Dwayne Johnson was a great addition to the cast, and seeing all of the main characters from the other 4 films in the series reuniting and having relations was a very nice touch.I enjoyed the plot more-so than I did in any other Fast and Furious movie. This time around, it felt like they were taking matters into their own hands, rather than just running from some higher power (Chinese Gang in 1, Colombian Drug Lord in 2, Japanese Mafia in 3, etc). It had some unexpected twists, that I didn't see coming until it was abruptly obvious, which was nice.The vault heist (featured in the trailer) was very entertaining to watch. The destruction was very over the top.. I'm pretty sure they committed a bank vault massacre taking out that bank and all.. but that's beside the point.The only part I found a little TOO far-fetched, was that the bank vault weighed ten times as much as the cars and they managed to fling it around like a rubber ball on a string.Other than that, solid movie. My parents hadn't seen the other titles and they enjoyed it too.Very entertaining, and if you're a fan at all of the other films you will find this to be a surprising take on the film series.",Fast Five

It explores the character personalities showing more humor, fear, vulnerability and determination this time around which gives the movie strength and depth that was missing from previous Fast n Furious movies. I found myself laughing out loud a few times at the subtle humor, and leaning forward for the action scenes which are truly amazing.The Story is not predictable and will keep the surprises coming to the end. The Cast has matured and it shows in the quality of acting over previous F'n'F movies.Pros:Good pace throughout the movieDecent storyline and plotGood Cast of actors/ actressesImaginative and inventive elements throughoutPlenty of ""Wow"" momentsCons: Would be nice to have more screen time for the carsa couple of cheesy moments ( but this adds to the humor of the film)Overall: Highly recommended film, Just be sure to stay until the end of the credits!9.5/10",Fast Five

We DON'T have deserts or that kind of train here!! Further, most of the actors who were supposed to be Brazilians were either Americans or Hispanics. They had a really weird Portuguese accent.

Probably never again! The movie has so many great moments from rooftop chases to gun battles to the amazing safe chase finale and all with very little or no CG - I'm just glad there were no tunnel chases like the previous movie. The quieter moments are great too, the extended family these characters have created make their bond very believable and like a real family they fight but ultimately have each others back. There are some extremely funny moments too, the toilet scene is funnier than anything in the latest Big Mommas House and any conversation between Tej and Roman is delightful. Surprisingly The Rock is barely in the movie but he does get a great post-credits moment with someone else from the franchise history. It's worth sticking round for that.

To organize my thoughts, I'll put the aspects of the film in a pros and cons list. Pros: The camera work surprisingly wasn't irritating to watch, as one might expect of a movie revolved around car racing. The action sequences, although far-fetched (as any action movie), was inventive and clouded with clear sound effects that fit the scenes. Cons: The whole movie seemed like a competition of who could deliver the most one-liners. The screenplay was limited, saying only what the audience expected them to say. The characters were shallow and stereotypic; no character stood out from the rest. On a 10 star scale, this movie would fairly deserve 5 stars.",Fast Five

Attractive females - yes. Fast Cars - yes. Cool fights - yes and also as many bad ass explosions as you could possibly wish for. Don't get me wrong, the story is kinda important too.So did ""Fast Five"" have what I was looking for ? In a word: Yes.So I heard about this film last summer if I remember correctly and has two thoughts - my first was ""Ugh, Another ?"" and my second was ""Yes, another. Nothing wrong with that"" - so as time went on I gradually got more and more excited to see this film.But enough about me, lets get on to the film.The story was good and picks up from the 4th one when Dom is busted out of prison and the crew make their way down to Rio ... and to the top of the most wanted list and this provides an exciting start which is continued throughout.The casting of Dwayne Johnson was one of my favourite parts about this film since I used to be a big wrestling fan and I thought he played his character brilliantly. As for the rest of the cast, they all had great performances and showed that they can really act.Also included in the film, hidden away - behind about 45 seconds of credits, so don't leave early - is an extra scene with DJ and I believe Eva Mendes as well revealing a twist in the last film and perfectly setting up number 6.So this film is definitely recommended, but do not go to the cinema expecting something on a par with The godfather or Schindler's list. Just sit back and enjoy the ride, cuz its as good as ""Fast and Furious"" is gonna get.",Fast Five

It is so ridiculous with such a huge vault is being dragged own by two cars and able to bring down buildings, cars everything on its way and without any single twist to the ropes from two cars.Script is so bad, characters lack the depth, there is no proper story at all.

I remember each and every model of the cars used in the movie. Or how cool it was see them push the NOS button to go faster. Or how cool the entire soundtrack of the movie was. It's one of those movies that no matter how many times you saw you could never get bored of.This movie just doesn't do that. Its one of those mindless action movies where you keep your brains in your car before you enter the theatre to preserve it in the same condition. Even though the action sequences in the movie are shown well, they are too far fetched and totally unrealistic.I felt the damage done to the city at the end was far greater than the cash they steal, for which they need to take a sequel to hunt them down where ever in the world they might have escaped to, to pay for all the damage done.But what i love is the moral of the story at the end.

On top of that he's supposed to be growing up and becoming brothers/partners with Vin but the script has Paul fawning for his attention like a little girl.Remove Tyrese and Luda from the movie, get a REAL bad guy, improve upon Paul and Vins acting, Shorten the movie, more cars and less lame one - liners!

To me the appeal of this series was getting to see fast cars, fast women and the main protagonists doing cool stuff.But now all we are getting is waaaay too much storyline, and guys doing ridiculous stuff.I mean come on! how did Dom get out of those chains? The stunt of pulling that safe with the two cars was ludicrous to say the least, and we are supposed to believe that in a 10 second window they managed to get it to stop in order to pull a switch with an empty safe..... an empty safe mind you that still behaved as the full one had! We are also to believe that 'stop at nothing' Officer Dwayne actually joined forces with them for a while, and then after the bad guys were dead gave our heroes a 24 hour head start before recommencing the chase? And speaking of the Rock........ he just looks ridiculous, he appears to have two rolls of invisible carpet under his arms the whole time...... and all those muscles did him no good anyway as he got his ass kicked. Not that you could tell what was going on due to the poorly shot fight scene.I understand suspension of disbelief and that a film like this is not supposed to win any Oscars so you should disengage your brain before watching, but IMHO this film was insulting crap that should never have been made, and as i said earlier, the twist at the end just capped it all off!!!

Second, it was more like Mexico, if I know something about that. Finally, I don't know where they found so many import cars for those do exist in very, very limited quantity. And just a dozen (in the entire country) are designated as patrol units, for use of senior officers who aren't seen around driving them.

This was really the best movie it had drama(I'm not some sort of movie critics expert but i like the storyline and everything it was sad, sometimes funny) it had action , it had everything. I give great respect to all the actors, and i must say I'm not gay or something but Diesel has the charisma that when i see his movies i don't have problems to see them again. Not like some Jason Bourne stuff it's good but you don't see it more than once.

Many people here in Brazil loved the movie as much as the series, but most agree that this was one of the worst, if not the worst. I liked the movie very much because he races cars and dizzying display of fantastic things involving cars and action.For me, the best part of the film disappeared. The story did not make any sense, it might make for the rest of the world who have a vision of Brazil in which criminals natives would lower their weapons to a bunch of strangers, but this will only in this fantasy film. The reality is very different, even though there are a lot of crime and violence here.Here we do not make movies with multimillion-dollar investments and no evidence of action worthy of a prize, but do not ridicule other countries with a view and that kind of history, a plot as mediocre. I expected a lot more to do justice to the name ""Fast and Furious"", and not just another action movie with explosions and gunfire scenes, among other things.

Nobody looks like they really believe in the movie, its almost written on their faces ""I am just doing this for the money""!! Its about as cheesy and unbelievable a movie that you will see this year, and probably next year, unless they do a F&F6. The one liners that they thought worked in the earlier movies are hear, long moody faces to camera are supposed to replace the storyline. Special effects are one thing but nearly everything in this movie is just laughably unbelievable, more like a cartoon. I am still reeling from the shock of this horror of a film.

However, it was a Fast and Furious movie (a series that I have been a huge fan of). When I went to the fourth movie, I did not go in expecting much, but to my surprise I found it to be one of the best in the series, which gave me high hopes for this one. Unfortunately, I ended up seeing a movie that was full disappointing action. It ripped away all the major things that the past Fast and Furious movies had been about. There were a lot of good, unrealistic, but good action sequences, but there was hardly any racing, or even much focus on cars for that matter. The only short racing scene in the whole movie doesn't even have street cars, they all race identical charger cop cars. Like I said, I don't think the movie is a poorly filmed movie, but I think that anybody who is a true fan of the series will be seriously let down. If you don't know much about the series but want a good action movie, then watch it.

The scene with the safe and the two cars going down main street of Rio, come on how the hell could it happen, watch top gear with Jermey Clarkson drive a evo towing a camper van as fast as they can, engine pistons come flying through the engine head and the camper van is on wheels not dragged.

411,explicit-1,Appalling,2,8 May 2011,"There's a limit to how many sequels you can make to an action movie that was not very smart to begin with and still end up with something watchable. They change the scenery a bit, one-up the carnage and the special effects, add a little seasoning and shake well.The thing that made the Fast and the Furious really good was always the fast cars and the portrayal of the street racer subculture with some crime and action on the side. Unfortunately Fast Five fails to deliver the proved formula - the action is too prominent, and frankly feels ridiculous most of the time. The street racing and the tuner scene are moved to the side to make room for more gunfights and ridiculous action scenes. The plot is predictably weak and while the regular cast makes a good effort of keeping the whole thing afloat, their efforts are undermined by some of the new faces (anyone like wrestling?).The whole thing feels like a meaningless series of action scenes glued together with a few romantic moments meant to tend the female demographic. There is no sense of flow throughout the movie and I never felt part of the action, it was not even remotely believable.

With that being said the first movies of fast and furious actually dealt with racing and fast cars. If you have seen the previous movies then you know that there are cars and racing involved. Now there has been the cut of that. This movie deals more about a problem among Dominic (Vin Diesel), Brian (Paul Walker), and Hernan (Joaquim). Brian and Dominic decide to bring in their own crew (friends from previous movies) in order to bring down Hernan and his flow of money. Throughout this entire plan of finishing off Hernan only about 3 to 4 times cars that we are use to seeing in this franchise come up. But there is only one race shown. The other time that fast action in a car comes in is at the end of the movie when Brian and Dominic are off with Hernan's vault trying to escape. That is the most action that comes out dealings with cars. I'm not saying it's a bad movie but I'm saying that there should be more scenes dealing with racing and cars.

413,vickyvickiewake,The BEST One In the Fast Series,7,8 June 2014,"I re-watched the whole series yesterday,one and two are basically alright because the special effects(which I could not possibly blame because of the technology back then)are kind of disappointing and it didn't quite articulate the whole truck thing.Tokyo Drift is kind of like a digression which basically contributes nothing to the series except for the mere introduction of Han.Han died at the end of Tokyo Drift but came back to life in 5&6,nobody explained why he did and how he did. Because they first became a team in 5,the cast was awesome.There were Dominic,Brian,Mia,Roman,Han,Hobbs etc(Saddly Letty was gone in 5).It was fantastic to see them working together towards something,and because we have been weaned on this freakish and terrific individualism, it was kind of great to finally have a team work.And Mia,as one of the only two main female character in this episode,is tough although she previously had been portrait as a helper in the family who washed dished,cooked and cleaned and stuff.She wasn't a tough and masculine fighter woman as Letty,but she did help and put what she got into this rob although she was pregnant, which was great,because we doesn't really need a female character who does nothing but moan and cry and beg the man to stay.I like the part that Dominic said there was finally someone who could understand his sorrow,it made me feel that Dom was actually really sensitive.But my favorite part is still the cash flowing out of the safety deposit scene,because I don't think figures are equally powerful as the vision of real money,like it is not that powerful to say that someone won a ten million dollars than to show the audience the stack of ten million dollars.Also,the part of giving Vince's son Vince's share of money was very touching. The finale was reassuring,bad guys dead,the team won,everybody was happy.In the end,I was fantasizing I was Gisele who was sitting on Han's laps kissing him while he was driving.It was a good production,good music and definitely did not ruin the franchise.",Fast Five
414,scaitke,n/a,7,30 September 2014,"Action packed with plenty of awesome cars!Fast Five is the fifth and most recent addition to the Fast and Furious series. Written by Chris Morgan and Gary Scott Thompson and directed by Justin Lin, this is the third Fast and Furious movie starring Vin Diesel, Paul Walker and Jordana Brewster. Set in Rio De Janeiro, former FBI agent Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) and his now friend Dominic Toretto ( Vin Diesel), facing 25 years to life in jail, are on the run from authorities and plotting a crime involving fast cars and a large sum of money. Brian's girlfriend (and Dom's sister, Mia, (Jordana Brewster)) helps in this caper. Fast Five opens with the bus rescue mission where Fast and Furious left off. The trio flee to Rio and are on track to complete their ""last job"" to make some good money and then disappear. The job goes sour when they discover a secret and realize they are up against a US federal agent (Dwayne Johnson) and his team and a Brazilian crime boss (Joaquim De Almeida).The movie is a fast paced action flick that is a great start to the 2011 summer season. At times silly and unbelievable, its predecessors were strictly race stories. This one veers off into more of a heist tale with secrets and fast cars. Dom and Brian are wanted for stealing cars from a Brazilian train and killing government agents (which they did not do). Characters from previous Fast and Furious movies appear such as Roman (Tyrese Gibson), Tej (Ludacris) and Han (Sung Kang). The newest character with the most impact is Agent Hobbs (Johnson), sent to Brazil to bring back Brian and Dom to the United States. Between Dom and Hobbs, it is the battle of the bulk. These two make a perfect conflict of brawn versus brawn. The Brazilian crime boss, Reyes (De Almeida), is out for Brian and Dom and an incredible chase scene ensues where Brian and Dom steal cars off a moving train. Is this realistic? Probably not. But who cares? It may not be realistic but it sure is entertaining to watch. This film is non-stop action. It's not only about cars, there are foot chases where Dom, Brian and Mia are attempting a getaway from Reyes and Hobbs. The buff Toretto and equally fit Hobbs duke it out in a classic fist fight and then of course there is the grand finale. Who would believe that a bank vault could be effectively ripped out of a wall and towed by two cars on a high speed chase through the streets of Brazil? This may sound silly, but somehow it works in this film. The action scenes are so intense and well set up, they are, for the most part believable.Much of the movie is spent setting up the heist. The characters are developed during this time. Roman (Gibson) is revealed as a loudmouth. Han (Kang) is reserved but his love interest in Gisele (Gal Gadot) reveals a more open side. Tej (Ludacris)comes out as the brains of the operation, by deciphering ways to access and open a military-grade vault. The film is 130 minutes and there is some fluff in the middle of the film but the chase scenes by car and on foot make it worth the wait. Mia is pregnant and sometimes you wonder how she can accomplish all this in her state. Somehow though, this is easily overlooked by her gutsy physicality. Where comedy was intended, the director missed the mark. There were a few instances where Roman (Gibson) provided much needed comic relief, but overall, besides the action and romance, the movie was a bit dry. This series of films has traditionally been geared towards young male viewers but with the new heist format, it becomes more attractive to female viewers as well. The physical build of Diesel and Johnson as well as the pregnancy and romance between Brian and Mia add an additional level that female viewers would enjoy. Even though the film is long and at times over the top, it delivers what fans of this genre are looking for.This film is no classic and there is a rather shallow storyline to follow. The script for Fast Five has improved over previous Fast and Furious series movies, yet it still lacks certain qualities of previous Fast and Furious movies. However, it still comes together well and makes a dynamic and memorable motion picture.",Fast Five

In this fifth installment, the trio lands in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil where they continue running into trouble. In order to be truly free, they attempt to pull off a $100 million heist by assembling a team consisting of characters from the previous ""Fast"" installments. Their mission rips through Brazil while federal agent, newcomer, Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) and crime lord, Hernan Reyes chase them the entire action-packed time.
The Fast and Furious franchise has never been known for heavy emotional and dramatic Oscar-nominated filmmaking. This time around, the no-nonsense, action themed, series with fast cars and wild stunts continues; with a bit of an Oceans 11 style heist thrown in the mix. Each character is an integral part of the team in order for the plan to work. Family is a common theme and the actors play their roles well, making the relationships believable. The 130 minute runtime doesn't seem sluggish or boring, particularly the dramatic ending involving a giant safe wrecking most of downtown Rio. Fast Five continues giving audiences exactly what you'd expect from the ""what you see is what you get"" series; tons of action, edge of your seat explosions, and of course, fast cars.

""Dom has a code, Brian has his own, and even this new character, Hobbs, played by Dwayne Johnson, has one. These codes create friction and conflict, increasing tension. It's great to see how sparks jump. "" Vin Diesel, speaking of the reaction of the followers, says: ""There are not many action films like ours that revolve around the family or, rather, a family of marginalized and misfits. We saw it in The Fast and the Furious and it happens the same in FAST & FURIOUS 5. The saga is based on a brotherhood that communicates something to the public. It symbolizes the family to which the viewer wants to belong because it will not abandon him, like Dom and his people. "" Followers made it clear that they were impatient to see another delivery. Paul Walker recalls Fast & Furious's enthusiasm: even faster: ""When we saw how successful he was, we knew there would be a fifth. Normally, the followers ask when the next one will come, but this time they did not ask, they affirmed it "".Adda Annotation Neal Moritz and Vin Diesel, who produce the film, were aware that the next installment had to overcome all of the above. They turned to director Justin Lin, whose work in the two previous installments proved that he could combine a story based on characters with insurmountable action scenes. He was the ideal person so that the spectators did not think that they had already seen it before.Add Annotation The filmmaker, a follower of the saga from the first installment, The Fast and the Furious, knew exactly what he wanted. The film had to be based on an impeccable casting with really amazing action scenes. ""There were still a lot of things left to discover,"" he says. ""I am very grateful to the study for not wanting to keep repeating the same thing over and over again. Thanks to this, the saga has been able to grow, evolve and mature. That's why I agreed to direct this new delivery. The basic theme of the saga is the family. The fourth installment explored the element of sacrifice that involves the family. As soon as I saw that the next one would deal with freedom and the family, I did not hesitate to return. "" He knew that if he directed his third installment, the expectations of the followers would be very high: ""The action in this film is greater than in the previous two together. There are about six action scenes, not just car chase, but also walk and steal. The film overflows action "". Although everything had to increase to satisfy the public, the action scenes would not make sense without the foundation of a good story, in which the heroes struggle to protect the family no matter what. Screenwriter Chris Morgan, another regular in the saga, joined Justin Lin to make sure the script reflected this vision. The preparation of FAST & FURIOUS 5 was at lightning speed. Chris Morgan, whose action-packed blockbuster scripts like Wanted / Se busca, Fast & Furious: even faster and A Todo gas: Tokio Race have earned him a well- deserved reputation as a scriptwriter specializing in action dramas, The work once more. ""For me, each new installment of the saga is an extension of the first,"" he says. ""It's always a privilege to go back to a story based on strong characters. This saga goes much beyond the races and the tuned cars, it speaks of a community, of a family of pilots "". Chris Morgan and Justin Lin have developed their own style in previous films. ""Having the beginning of the filming around the corner forced us to put the batteries,"" explains the writer. ""Justin and I attacked the story very differently, but when we started working together, I do not know what's going on, we always end up following the same path."" The idea of ​​reuniting more characters from previous films emerged during the pre-production of Fast & Furious: even faster, but since the plot was focused mainly on Dom, Brian and his companions, it was decided to leave this possibility aside. Neal Moritz says, ""When we saw the public reaction with Vin, Paul, Jordana and Michelle together again, we all thought the same thing: 'What if we met them all?'"" Vin Diesel was convinced that the tandem Dom-Brian could star in another chapter of the franchise: ""Of course, I wanted to continue with the story and I always thought of three stories, beginning with The Fast and the Furious, followed by Fast & Furious: even faster and now, FAST & FURIOUS 5 "". But one of the goals of this film was to bring together characters who had appeared in other chapters. "" The idea was good, but the difficulty lay in incorporating them into the story created at.",Fast Five

421,triscope,What a steaming pile of crap!,1,5 May 2011,"I just don't understand how people can give this anything above 3/10. Its just so ridiculously stupid on so many levels it would take me the whole day to write up whats wrong with this film if you want to call it that. The acting is extremely poor as expected, many scenes are extremely cheesy and cliché. The stunts are so grossly unrealistic that it pisses me off that they even try and make us believe this sh*t is even remotely possible. It's just as realistic as having them fly around like superman and creating antimatter out of their asses.This whole movie is just dumb on too many levels and those who enjoyed it are equally dumb! I want 2 hours of my life back!",Fast Five

424,saintssilhouette,Complete disappointment,3,9 May 2011,"I don't understand how people review this movie as being good. It was terrible. The plot had many loopholes so if you want to appreciate a good story, you can't. Even if you look beyond the loopholes in the story, some of the scenes are just impossible. What I loved about the first movie was the fact that for the most part it was realistic. This movie had too many unrealistic scenes. I'd rather not gives examples cause I don't want to spoil the movie for anyone.Someone described this movie as being a heist film rather than street racing. It was well said, because if you turn a street racing movie into a heist movie, its obviously going to fail. And there is just no way to make a good plot out of it. Just so some people have an idea of how disappointing this movie was... there is no race scenes. At least none that important or anything. It was not a fast and the furious movie at all. It was just a way for them to make so much money.",Fast Five
425,tnul,Fabulastic movie!,9,8 February 2019,"Are you still at home ??? Quickly get ready, take your friends and run to the cinema to not miss this fantastic film!
I did not miss any part of the movie Fast and the Furious. Part 5 is not less cool than the previous ones - crazy races, Vin Diesel, chases, love.. I'm ready to watch this film again and again. Of course, it's better to watch it on the big screen, to enhance the effect :D",Fast Five
